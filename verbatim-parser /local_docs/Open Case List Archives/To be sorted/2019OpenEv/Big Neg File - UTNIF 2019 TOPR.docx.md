#### US International Relations theory constructs China as a threat in order to legitimate its own claim to military supremacy and global leadership -- the 1AC's rearticulation of this anxiety is marked by a fundamental fear of anarchy that inflects all IR scholarship that comes from the US that reaffirms its self-imagination as ethical and good, or at worst, a necessary evil in the quest to preserve global order.

Western Representations of China's Rise // AH

The West has been imagining itself in various ways for centuries, if not
longer, a complex subject which no doubt warrants a separate study. 9
But here I argue that the West as a modern project is modelled
ultimately on an image of the modern knowing subject, who is defined by
a desire for certainty and a will to truth. [With this fundamental
self-understanding, the West could not only feel certain about itself,
but also exercise its reason and authority over an objective and
knowable world 'out there']{.underline}. As Charles William Maynes
notes, the US, since the times of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson,
has been convinced 'that we know the way---politically and
economically---and that therefore [we have an obligation, if not also a
right, to lead others to a better future']{.underline}.10 In this sense,
the will to truth and certainty has been central to the West's search
for identity and power. The inevitable existence of uncertainty and
inscrutability in nature and the outside world then becomes a standing
threat to the identity and security of this modern self. [At one level,
the knowing subject may find refuge in fear as an emotional substitute
for certainty. In other words, 'What we do not know we fear'.11 Through
fear, the unknown world becomes at least a known unknown]{.underline}
(to borrow former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's parlance), [or
a negative form of certainty in terms of Otherness, danger, and threat.
Thus understood, threat is not an object out there, but a necessary
corollary of the Western desire for absolute certainty and
security.]{.underline} Even Kristol and Kagan readily admit that their
much-feared 'present danger' 'has no name. It is not to be found in any
single strategic adversary.... It is a danger, to be sure, of our own
devising'.12 The China Threat as a Reflection of the Western
Self-imagination [The self-imagination as the modern knowing subject
affords the West a sense of scientific and moral authority. At the same
time, it also justifies its need for imperial expansion and strategic
dominance.]{.underline} Both the European Union's (EU) self-identity as
a 'Normative Power Europe' and the **[US's God-given right to military
supremacy and global leadership can be understood in this
context]{.underline}**. Indeed, for neoconservatives, [the US, a
quintessential Western society, is entitled to both moral clarity and
military hegemony]{.underline}. [However, as soon as the US stakes its
self-identity on 'universal dominion' and absolute security worldwide,
13 its 'encounters' with numerous threats becomes a logical necessity.
**The China threat is a product of precisely such encounters and self
imagination**. Taking global hegemony in general and dominance in Asia
in particular as part and parcel of American self-identity, one would
'naturally' treat China's regional influence as a threat]{.underline};
it can hardly be otherwise. But this is a challenge above all to the
latter's expansionist strategic selfimagination and the certainty and
continuity it entails. [As Huntington reasoned, 'Chinese hegemony will
reduce American and Western influence \[there\] and compel the United
States to accept what it has historically attempted to prevent:
domination of a key region of the world by another
power']{.underline}.15 [Thanks to this longstanding American
self-imagery, it is fair to say that much of the China threat is
imagined as well]{.underline}. The much-feared Chinese 'string of
pearls' strategy is a case in point. [Describing China's alleged
ambition of establishing a series of naval bases along various strategic
choke points from Southeast Asia to eastern Africa, the term is nowhere
to be seen in China's military playbook]{.underline}. Rather, it is
mostly the work of US strategic imagination, first used in an internal
report titled Energy Futures in Asia commissioned by the US Department
of Defense. 16 In Europe where collective self-identity is constructed
less on the basis of military strength, the China threat does not figure
as prominently as it does in the eyes of American strategic planners.
Indeed, in 2009, Kagan expressed his displeasure at what he saw as
Europe's indifference to the proliferation of military threats. Though
not explicitly acknowledging the central role of selfidentity in the
construction of threat, he nevertheless correctly attributed their
divergent threat perceptions to the different ways in which the US and
Europe identify themselves. As he wrote: If Europe's strategic culture
today places less value on hard power and military strength and more
value on such soft-power tools as economics and trade, isn't it partly
because Europe is militarily weak and economically strong? Americans are
quicker to acknowledge the existence of threats, even to perceive them
where others may not see any, because they can conceive of doing
something to meet those threats.17 No longer primarily identifying
itself in military terms, contemporary Europe now prides itself on being
a normative or civic power, home to such universal values as human
rights, democracy and good governance. As a result, it sees the China
difference both as an opportunity for political change and an
ideological challenge to the teleological certainty of the European
self. Of course, moral clarity is not unique to Europe, but is integral
to the US self-imagination as well[. As such, in addition to the fear of
China's strategic ambition, Washington is similarly ambivalent about the
opportunity and threat of the Chinese Other. Through the same prisms of
democracy and modernisation, Americans constantly 'found China lacking'
or even threatening. Nancy Bernkopf Tucker rightly argues that 'Unless
the United States changes \[the moral parameters of its political
self-imagination\], that conclusion will not change'.]{.underline} 18 In
other words, its fear of China has less to do with China's difference
per se than with the particular way in which the Western self is
constructed. If there is a China threat, its menace lies primarily in
its perceived psychological 'disruption' of the lingering
Western/American colonial desire about how the world should be run and
about how history should progress. 19 No doubt, some would protest that
the 'China threat' conclusion stands on the firm ground of realism, and
has nothing to do with the way the West identifies itself. For example,
according to Mearsheimer, in a world of anarchy, 'states can never be
certain about the intentions of other states', 20 and therefore have to
treat each other as a potential threat. **[Yet, I would argue that such
an insatiable demand for transparency from others is itself a telltale
sign of the Western quest for certainty, security, and identity as the
modern knowing subject.]{.underline}** [Similarly, the realist
first-image of human nature, which is often implicitly invoked in the
explanation of the China threat, has less to do with human nature per se
than with the Western quest for scientific truth about human
society.]{.underline} The Hobbesian 'discovery' of the first man and
human nature, as C. B. Macpherson argues, was not the objective
knowledge of man per se, but rather a conscious or unconscious
autobiographical reflection of Western modern man and his living
condition in a 'bourgeois market society'.21 **[Insofar as the 'China
threat' paradigm has been informed partly by the Hobbesian fear of every
man against every man, this China threat representation is best seen as
a mirror image of some historically specific and selective
self-experience of the West.]{.underline}** Two specific arguments in
the 'China threat' discourse are illustrative of this point. The first
is the widely-invoked Germany analogy. Former US Deputy Secretary of
Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who was instrumental in the formation of
Washington's official view of China as a 'strategic competitor', 22 was
convinced by the 'obvious and disturbing analogy' between Wilhelmine
Germany and today's China. Though briefly acknowledging the differences
between the two powers, he insisted on their many 'similarities'. For
him, just as Germany's transition from the statesmanship of Bismarck to
the incompetence of his successors contributed to the tragedy of World
War I, so too China, which is in the process of a similar transition
'from two decades of extremely skilful management of its international
relationships to a new leadership of uncertain quality', poses a serious
threat to the international order.23 In an influential piece published
in The National Interest, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen similarly
argue that Like Germany a century ago, China is a late-blooming great
power emerging into a world already ordered strategically by earlier
arrivals; a continental power surrounded by other powers who are
collectively stronger but individually weaker (with the exception of the
United States and, perhaps, Japan); a bustling country with great
expectations, dissatisfied with its place in the international pecking
order, if only with regard to international prestige and respect. The
quest for a rightful "place in the sun" will... inevitably foster
growing friction with Japan, Russia, India or the United States.24 What
this Germany analogy can tell us is that the Western knowledge of the
China threat is based, more than anything else, on a fear of repetition
of a European nightmare scenario. Its fear of China, situated in the
broader sense of paranoia that Europe's past may become Asia's future,25
The America analogy tells a similar story. Kagan argues that 'if
Americans want to understand Chinese power and ambition today, they
could start by looking in the mirror'. is derived less from China's rise
or its uncertain intentions than from the self-righteous certainty about
the universality of Western historical trajectory. 26 This is exactly
what Mearsheimer has done. [**After extrapolating American history in
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to a status of the unchangeable
'tragedy' of great power politics in general, Mearsheimer insists that
China will have to, almost slavishly, follow the same path: for sound So
we would expect China to attempt to dominate Japan and Korea, as well as
other regional actors, by building military forces that are so powerful
that those other states would not dare challenge it**. We would also
expect China to develop its own version of the Monroe Doctrine, directed
at the United States. Just as the United States made it clear to distant
great powers that they were not allowed to meddle in the Western
Hemisphere, China will make it clear that American interference in Asia
is unacceptable.]{.underline}27 Clearly, Mearsheimer's 'China threat'
assessment is based not so much on what China does in the present as it
is on what the US itself did in the past.28 **[His repeated anxious
'expectations' of China testify to a paranoia of both China's Otherness
and its emerging sameness]{.underline}**. His fear reflects, in the
final analysis, the lingering ambivalence of colonial desire towards the
mimicry of the American self-experience by an Oriental Other. [The
autobiographical nature of the 'China threat' discourse is so obvious
that many references to the 'China menace']{.underline} (such as the
'Beijing Consensus' and 'Chinese Lake'[) are directly modelled on the
Western/American self.]{.underline} Little wonder that Mel Gurtov, while
reading a 2005 US Defense Department report on China's military threat,
found the report's comments on China ironically more fitting to describe
US power and intention than China's.29 The US is certainly not unique in
the projection of self-experience onto the understanding of others. As
scholars of literary criticism and Australian colonial history have
pointed out, Australia's fixation with the fiction of an Asian invasion
has been bound up with its self-consciousness as a settler country,
which itself was born of invasion. Australia's anxiety about its
northern neighbours, in which China often looms large, has been
sustained by the fear that a nation created by European invasion could
subsequently be taken over by an Asian/Chinese invasion. **[30 Thus, the
anxiety and fear of China felt by the West does not stem primarily from
what China is or what it does, but from an anxious Western self, or more
precisely, from its own historical role in the production of anxiety and
fear suffered by others.]{.underline}** Perhaps unwittingly[, the 'China
threat' paradigm exhibits an unspoken fear of the logic of mutual
responsiveness in international relations: with China's rise, there is a
danger that China might begin to imitate what 'we' have done to others,
this time at 'our' expense.]{.underline} Constructing the Western Self
in the 'China Threat' Paradigm The 'China threat' paradigm is a
discursive construct closely linked with Western/American colonial
desire and historical experience. It reflects the inability or at least
unwillingness of the Western/American self to make sense of China beyond
their own fear and realpolitik trajectories. **[In doing so, its
ethnocentric representation of China provides the West with a measure of
strategic familiarity and moral certainty, thus reaffirming the
self-imagination of the West.]{.underline}** [The imagination of an
external 'threat' or Other has long been instrumental to the formation
and maintenance of self-identity]{.underline}.31 In the logic of what
Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri call 'colonialist representations', the
difference of the Other, first having been pushed to the extreme, 'can
be inverted in a second moment as the foundation of the Self. In other
words, the evil, barbarity, and licentiousness of the colonized Other
are what make possible the goodness, civility, and propriety of the
European Self'. They go on to say that 'Only through opposition to the
colonized does the metropolitan subject really become itself'. 32 The
threatening imagery of 'wilderness' in the early periods of American
nation-building served a similar purpose in that it helped maintain
America's 'New World mythology'. As James Robertson notes, 'there is no
New World without wilderness. If we are to be true Americans (and thus
part of that New World and its destiny), there must be wilderness. [The
symbol is an imperative for our real world'.33The construction of
self-identity through the discourses of threat, Otherness and wilderness
perhaps culminated in the poetics and politics of the Cold War, 'an
important moment in the (re)production of American
identity'.]{.underline}34 In this process, discourses of international
relations and foreign policy played a central role. They helped create
and police boundaries and Otherness so that a unified self could be
identified and protected**[. As Campbell notes, 'The constant
articulation of danger through foreign policy is thus not a threat to a
state's identity or existence: it is its condition of possibility. While
the objects of concern change over time, the techniques and exclusions
by which those objects are constituted as dangers
persist']{.underline}**.35 In this sense, although the Cold War was a
pivotal moment in the Western/American construction of threat, such a
discursive practice is not confined to the Cold War.36 Not surprisingly
then, the Cold War's end did little to disrupt the discursive ritual of
constructing Otherness. If anything, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
demise of the 'Evil Empire' demanded more threats, simply because their
very absence would become a threat to the coherence and unity of the
West/the US. Without clearly identifiable enemies, 'there can be no
overarching ontology of security, no shared identity differentiating the
national self from threatening others, no consensus on what---if
anything--- should be done'. It is, as noted before, embedded in the
modern quest for certainty, and the Cold War mentality is only a
historically specific manifestation of that ongoing modern colonial
desire.

#### The 1ac's rearticulation of realism demarcates time and space through presenting a sovereign, stable representation of International Relations theory. This theoretical approach superimposes racial difference and delimits who can be a proper subject of History within IR's epistemic scope -- this erases non-European existence and legitimates colonialism, which turns and outweighs the aff.

Fanon and Hartman about temporality and violence," in *Time,
Temporality, and Violence in International Relations: (De)fatalizing the

**[Many realists present sovereignty as a formal, stable representation
of an idealized vision of political order, a solution to war or brute
violence; though embodied, these historical relations are rife with
tensions]{.underline}** (Krasner 2001; Morgenthau 1951; Waltz 1979).
**[They contain an implicit or explicit axiological hierarchy,
extrapolate an account of desirable political arrangements, and posit a
stable and unified conception of the state and institutional
arrangements and subjectivity primed to bring about that
order.]{.underline}** **[When sovereignty and war are used to produce
certain behaviors, perspectives, or political outcomes, they work
together as a particular kind of disciplinary construct that evades
time, even though time binds them.]{.underline}** The uncritical
acceptance of this displacement of time from our conceptualization of
the sovereign and war generates problems for our narration of history,
the sover- eign, war, violence, and political subjects. **[We must ask
whether such limited and politically circumscribed accounts become the
drivers of petrified relations and the mark of death, even when espoused
otherwise.]{.underline}** Engaging with theorists who problematize the
narrowly punctuated understand- ings of sovereignty, war, capital, and
subjectivity (Hartman 2007; Marriott 2014; Mbembe 1992; Wilderson 2010)
ought to yield insights. Even more important are Saidiya Hartman's
narration of the entanglements of time and slavery and Fanon's account
of violence, sovereignty, and capital. **[By superimposing time onto
various other given states and racialized situations to show their
'difference,' both grap- ple with time in relation to slavery,
colonization, and capitalism]{.underline}**. They open up questions
about sovereignty by creating theoretical concepts that traverse the
gaps among theorists of sovereignty, history, war, violence, and
capital. **[When we think in terms of time and temporality, the
parameters of the con- ceptualization of violence and fatalization of
the present change dramatically, allowing us to consider the
complexities of lived human experience and high- light dimensions of
social life that IR and certain critical postcolonial theorists have
seen as irrelevant.]{.underline}** In this chapter, in conversation with
Fanon and Hartman, we point to the ruptures/tensions accompanying
material technologies/the inven- tions, the 'real leap's in Fanon's
words (Fanon 1952: 229). Fanon's real leaps are radically untimely
(Marriott 2014: 518). They cannot be speculated or preempted. They are a
creative invention of a grammar that grapples with the 'form of antino-
mies of redemption (a salvational principle that will help us overcome
the injury of slavery and the long history of defeat) and
irreparability' (Hartman 2002: 759). Thinking of the force of time and
the event via Hartman on slavery and colo- nization stretches our narrow
understandings of sovereign power and forces of capture, allowing us to
consider imaginaries, as well as the ways institutions such as the state
and market consider some subjects mere esh outside the dialectical
movement of history or capital. **[Although we cannot fully represent or
narrate them, forces of time and the event produce problems. To a
greater or lesser extent, we can mark their interjec- tions and
irruptions into life otherwise experienced as continuity: we can per-
ceive their qualities, analyze indices of their interjection, and even
make them somewhat predictable. We are affected by them; we intensify
their force; we even precipitate their transformation.]{.underline}**
This chapter takes seriously Fanon's idea that 'the problem to be
considered here is one of time' (Fanon 1952: 226--227). In conversation
with Fanon and Hartman, we show the ways time and temporality in ect our
imagination and engagement with time and vulnerability in international
relations and world politics. One theo- rist takes the idea of time as a
problem of time (Fanon 1952) and as a force, 'arbi- trary and violent,
that positions \[the racialized subject\] globally' (Murillo 2013). The
other ruptures a linear understanding of the sovereign and the ways we
narrate violence to exclude slavery and colonization in its gendered
forms: her notion of an 'original generative act,' with the 'centrality'
of its 'blood-stained gate,' posits the ontological destruction of the
black woman as the 'inaugurating moment in the for- mation of the
enslaved' within modernity's violent arena of value (Hartman 2007: 18).
Both authors take seriously the way **[the concept of time becomes a
producer of a globality whose 'ontological horizon is manufactured by
scientific signifiers' (the sovereign as analogy or anarchy as metaphor)
and 'the political-symbolic weapons']{.underline}** (da Silva 1997: 5)
**[that produce non-Europeans as non-existent 'untimely'
subjects.]{.underline}** **[Those 'who thrive in the mark of
death']{.underline}** (ibid: 5) **[are not covered by the ethical prin-
ciples governing post-Enlightenment social
configurations.]{.underline}**

#### The construction of China as a threat is a self-fulfilling prophesy through a self-productive mode of representation -- the aff's representational politics makes US/China war inevitable and legitimates US exceptionalism.

Western Representations of China's Rise // AH

[If changing Chinese public opinion and Beijing's growing assertiveness
in foreign policy are better understood in the context of mutual
responsiveness, then threatening as they may appear, they at least
partly reflect the selffulfilling effect of the China threat theory as
practice.]{.underline} That is, **[they are to some extent socially
constructed by Western representations of the China
threat]{.underline}**. At this juncture, we may return to the question
raised earlier---What's the cost of having an enemy**[? The cost, simply
put, is that perceiving China as a threat and acting upon that
perception help bring that feared China threat closer to
reality.]{.underline}** Though not an objective description of China,
[the 'China threat' paradigm is no mere fantasy, as it has the
constitutive power to make its prediction come true.]{.underline} If
this China paradigm ends up bearing some resemblance to Chinese reality,
it is because the reality is itself partly constituted by it. **[With US
strategic planners continuing to operate on the basis of the China
threat, this self-fulfilling process has persisted to the present
day.]{.underline}** For example, in July 2010, when China objected to
the joint USSouth Korean navy exercise in the Yellow Sea to no avail, it
announced that its navy would conduct live fire drills in the East China
Sea for the duration of the US-South Korean manoeuvres. 129 Meanwhile, a
Global Times (a Chinese daily tabloid affiliated with the official
People's Daily) editorial opines that 'Whatever harm the US military
manoeuvre may have inflicted upon the mind of the Chinese, the United
States will have to pay for it, sooner or later'.130 All such Chinese
'belligerence' seems to have provided fresh evidence to the 'China
threat' paradigm, whose image of China has now been vindicated.131
Without acknowledging their own role in the production of the 'China
threat'**[, 'China threat' analysts thus play a key part in a spiral
model of tit-for-tat in Sino-US relations]{.underline}**. Mindful of
this danger, some cool-headed observers have warned that a US attempt to
build a missile defence shield could be reciprocated by China deploying
more missiles.132 Even the highly classified US National Intelligence
Estimate (NIE) report Foreign Responses to U.S. National Missile Defense
Deployment has hinted at this possibility. 133 In early 2006, **[Mike
Moore, contributing editor of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
predicted that if the US continues to weaponise space by deploying a
comprehensive space-control system, 'China will surely
respond']{.underline}**.134 And respond it did. In early 2007, [it
launched a ballistic missile to destroy an inoperational weather
satellite in orbit]{.underline}. That test immediately caused a stir in
the international press, even though it came after Washington's repeated
refusal to negotiate with China and Russia over their proposed ban on
space weapons and the use of force against satellites. A Financial Times
article noted that 'What is surprising about the Chinese test is that
anyone was surprised'.135 In a similar vein but commenting on the
broader pattern of US strategy on China over the years, Lampton notes
that 'Washington cannot simply seek to strengthen ties with India,
Japan, the Republic of Korea, and central Asian states as an explicit
offset to rising Chinese power and then be surprised when Beijing plays
the same game'.136 Nevertheless, such surprise is commonplace in the
China watching community, reflecting an intellectual blindness to the
self-fulfilling nature of one of its time-honoured paradigms. This
blindness, in turn, allows the justification of more containment or
hedging. In this way, **[the 'China threat' paradigm is not only
self-fulfilling in practice, but also self-productive and
self-perpetuating as a powerful mode of representation]{.underline}**.
[One might take comfort in the fact that neither Beijing nor Washington
actually wants a direct military confrontation. But that is beside the
point, for the lack of aggressive intention alone is no proven safe
barrier to war.]{.underline} As in the cases of the Korean War and the
Vietnam War, the outbreak of war does not necessarily require the
intention to go to war.137 Mutual suspicion, as US President Theodore
Roosevelt once observed of the Kaiser and the English, is often all that
is needed to set in motion a downward spiral. 138 **[And thanks to the
'China threat' paradigm and its mirror image and practice from China,
mutual suspicion and distrust has not been in short
supply.]{.underline}** 139 [A war between these two great powers is not
inevitable or even probable; the door for mutual engagement and
cooperation remains wide open.]{.underline} Nevertheless[, blind to its
own self-fulfilling consequences, **the 'China threat' paradigm**, if
left unexamined and unchecked, **would make cooperation more difficult
and conflict more likely.**]{.underline} It is worth adding that my
treatment of Chinese nationalism and realpolitik thinking is not to
downplay their potentially dangerous consequences, much less to justify
them. Quite the contrary, for all the apparent legitimacy of reciprocal
counter-violence or counter-hedging, Chinese mimicry is dangerous, as it
would feed into this tit-for-tat vicious cycle and play its part in the
escalation of a security dilemma between the US and China. Thus, to
emphasise Chinese responsiveness is not to deny Chinese agency or
exonerate its responsibility. [While the general nature of Chinese
foreign policy may be responsive with regard to the US, its 'contents'
are not simply passive, innocent mimicry of US thinking and
behaviour]{.underline}, but inevitably come with some 'Chinese
characteristics'. That said, those 'Chinese characteristics'
notwithstanding, there is no pregiven China threat both unresponsive to
and immune from any external stimulus. To argue otherwise is to deny an
important dimension of Chinese agency, namely, their response-ability.
**[By examining the self-fulfilling tendency of the 'China threat'
paradigm, we can better understand that Sino-American relations, like
international relations in general, are mutually responsive and
constitutive]{.underline}**. Thus, both China and the US should be held
accountable to the bilateral relationship of their mutual making. To the
extent that this 'China threat' knowledge often denies such mutuality,
and by extension, US responsibility in the rise of the China threat, it
is all the more imperative to lay bare its intrinsic link with power
practice.

#### This is particularly true of representations of Taiwan in US IR theory -- the 1AC ensures conflict escalation, which turns the aff -- and it results in US interventionism, containment strategies, and colonial violence.

In the eyes of many U.S. China watchers, China\'s approach to the Taiwan
question is a microcosm of its grand strategy to dominate Asia. The
argument is that nowhere is the threatening ambition more palpable than
in China\'s saber-rattling missile tests near Taiwan\'s coast in
1995-1996, in addition to its long-standing refusal to renounce the use
of force as a last resort to settle the dispute.72 While the 1995-1996
missile crisis has been a favorite \"starting point\" for many pundits
and practitioners to paint a frightening picture of China and to justify
U.S. firm response to it, what is often conveniently overlooked is the
question of how the \"China threat\" discourse itself had played a
constitutive role in the lead-up to that crisis. Limits of space forbid
exploring this complex issue here. **[Simply put, the Taiwan question
was created largely as a result of widespread U.S. perceptions of China
as a \"Red Menace\" in the wake of the \"loss of China\" and the
outbreak of the Korean War]{.underline}**. [To thwart what it saw as an
orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia, the United States deployed the
U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as part of its Cold War
containment strategy, thereby effectively preventing the reunification
of Taiwan with mainland China**. While the United States abandoned its
containment and isolation policy toward China in the 1970s and the two
countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979, the
conventional image of the \"Red Menace\" lingered on in the United
States. To manage such a \"threat,\" the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan
Relations Act shortly after the normalization of U.S.-China relations,
renewing U.S. commitment to Taiwan\'s defense even though diplomatic
ties with the island had been severed**]{.underline}.73 This
confrontational policy serves not only to shore up Taiwan\'s defense
capabilities but also to induce its independent ambition and further
complicate cross-strait relations. As former U.S. defense official Chas
Freeman remarked, \"[U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work to boost
Taipei\'s confidence that it can work out its differences with Beijing.
Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its own
way]{.underline}.\"74 For instance, amid growing sympathy from the
Republican-dominated Congress and the elite media as well as the
expanded ties with the United States, Taiwan responded coolly to
Beijing\'s call for dialogue in January 1995. [In June 1995, Taiwan\'s
flexible diplomacy, designed to burnish its independent image,
culminated in its president Lee Teng-hui\'s high-profile visit to the
United States. This in turn reinforced Beijing\'s suspicion that the
real U.S. intention was to frustrate its reunification goal, leaving it
apparently no other choice but to prepare militarily for what it saw as
a worst-case scenario]{.underline}. All this constituted the major
context in which the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile exercises took
place. [For most Chinese, the carrying out of these military exercises,
well within their own territory, had little to do with attacking Taiwan,
much less with challenging U.S. security interests in the western
Pacific. Rather, it was about China\'s long-cherished dream of national
unity, with its \"sabre rattling\" tactics serving merely as a warning
to the United States, as well as to Taiwan.]{.underline} However,
interpreting such exercises as China\'s muscle-flexing with direct
security implications for the region, with \"an almost 19th-century
display of gunboat diplomacy,\"75 the United States dispatched two
nuclearpowered aircraft carriers to the region of Taiwan. While not
denying the potential security repercussions of China\'s missile tests
for the region**[, I suggest that the flashpoint of Taiwan says as much
about the danger of this U.S. approach to China as about the threat of
Beijing\'s display of force itself.]{.underline}** \"Had Bill Clinton
projected a constancy of purpose and vision in China policy .. . in
1993-1994,\" David M. Lampton argues, \"he might not have been
challenged in the Taiwan Strait in 1995-1996 with missile exercises.\"76
Indeed, it was primarily in the context of this U.S. intervention that
Zhongguo keyi shuo bu (China can say no), one of the most anti-U.S.
books ever produced in China, emerged and quickly became a best-seller
in the Chinese reading world.77 Meanwhile, some Chinese strategic
thinkers were so alarmed by the U.S. show of strength that they told
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, one of Henry Kissinger\'s close associates, that
they were rereading the early works of George F. Kennan because
\"containment had been the basis of American policy toward the Soviet
Union; now that the United States was turning containment against China,
they wanted to learn how it had started and evolved.\"78 If such a scary
interaction between the United States and China remained somehow
obscured here, it would soon be manifested again in another standoff in
U.S.-China relations; namely, the spyplane incident of 2001. Following
the 1995-1996 missile crisis, mainstream China observers have continued
to take the Taiwan question as a purely geopolitical or security issue,
which accordingly should be understood and dealt with simply from the
time-honored balance-of-power, zero-sum game perspectives. For example,
Bernstein and Munro insist that Taiwan\'s reunification with the
mainland \"will leave China in possession of yet another immense
economic prize. . . . Complete Chinese reunification, in other words,
would further upset the balance of power and vastly enhance China\'s
economic and strategic strength.\"79 Commenting on this typical way of
representing the Taiwan question, [the Taiwan-based scholar Chih-yu Shih
suggests that the national security analysis may seem to be a more
tangible approach to dissecting the rationale behind Beijing\'s \"policy
of coercion\" and, because it appears sensible to us, can alleviate our
need to pursue Beijing\'s motivations more deeply.]{.underline} Not only
can we thus camouflage our embarrassment at not really knowing China,
but also Beijing\'s discomforting behavioural patterns become
comfortably familiar.80 Clearly, the practical implications of this kind
of representation go far beyond that. After perceiving a power imbalance
in the Taiwan Strait in favor of China, James Lilley (former U.S.
ambassador to China) and Carl Ford proposed: \"The name of the game for
Taiwan, then, is deterrence,\" which means that the United States must
help Taiwan\'s military maintain \"a qualitative edge over the PRC.\"8i
The 2002 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Security Review Commission
reached similar conclusions, recommending, among other things,
\"deterring China attacking Taiwan\" and \"supporting Taiwan\'s ability
to defend itself without outside assistance.\" In its formal conclusion,
the review commission, made up of well-known U.S. China experts as well
as influential policymakers, vows to continue monitoring China in every
aspect relating to \"our national security concerns.\"82 In fact, U.S.
monitoring activity, such as conducting reconnaissance flights along
Chinese borders, had always been part of its China policy. So went the
rationale: The Chinese say they have the right to use force to reclaim
Taiwan because it belongs to them, and they regularly practice for an
invasion. This threat of force is why on April 1st \[2001\], the U.S.
Navy\'s EP-3 surveillance plane was in the area to monitor China\'s
military preparations.83 [Yet it turned out that the EP-3 spy plane
collided with a Chinese navy fighter jet that was tailing it over the
South China Sea, some fifty miles from the coast of China\'s Hainan
Province. The Chinese jet crashed into the waters below, while the
crippled spy plane landed on Hainan island. Washington demanded
immediate return of its crew and plane, while Beijing insisted that the
United States bear the responsibility for the midair collision and
apologize for the incident. Rather than reflecting on how their new
containment policy might have contributed to this incident in the first
place, many U.S. realist analysts hastily interpreted it as further
objective proof of the long-suspected \"China threat.\" As Allen S.
Whiting put it, the collision \"focused attention anew on Beijing\'s
willingness to risk the use of force in pursuit of political
objectives.\"84 It was as if the whole incident had little to do with
U.S. spying, which was seen as \"routine\" and \"normal.\" Instead, it
was the Chinese who were said to be \"playing a dangerous game,\"
without regard to the old spy etiquette formulated during the Cold
War.85 For other observers, China\'s otherness was embodied also in its
demand for a U.S]{.underline}. apology. For example, Merle Goldman, a
history professor at Boston University, said that the Chinese emphasis
on apologies was rooted in the Confucian value system: \"This kind of
internalized consensus was the way China was ruled for thousands of
years.\"86 From this perspective, China\'s request for an apology was
preordained by a fixed Chinese tradition and national psyche and had
nothing whatsoever to do with the specific context of this incident in
which China was spied on, its sovereignty violated, and one of its
pilots lost**[. Thus, even in the face of such a potentially explosive
incident, the self-fulfilling effect of the \"China threat\" discourse
has not been acknowledged by mainstream U.S. China analysts. To the
contrary, deterring and containing China has gained new
urgency]{.underline}**. For example, in the aftermath of this standoff,
neoconservative columnists Robert Kagan and William Kristol (chairman of
the Project for the New American Century) wrote that \"not only is the
sale of Aegis \[to Taiwan\] . . . the only appropriate response to
Chinese behavior; We have been calling for the active containment of
China for the past six years precisely because we think it is the only
way to keep the peace.\"87 Although the sale of the Aegis destroyers was
deferred, President George W. Bush approved an arms package for Taiwan
that included so-called \"defensive\" weapons such as four Kidd class
destroyers, eight diesel submarines, and twelve P-3C submarine-hunting
aircraft, as well as minesweeping helicopters, torpedoes, and amphibious
assault vehicles. On this arms sale, David Shambaugh, a Washington-based
China specialist, had this to say: \"Given the tangible threats that the
Chinese military can present to Taiwan---particularly a naval blockade
or quarantine and missile threats---this is a sensible and timely
package.\"88 Given the danger and high stakes involved, some may wonder
why China did not simply cooperate so that there would be no need for
U.S. \"containment.\" To some extent, China has been cooperative. For
example, Beijing was at pains to calm a disgruntled Chinese public by
explaining that the U.S. \"sorry\" letter issued at the end of the
spy-plane incident was a genuine \"apology,\" with U.S. officials openly
rejecting that interpretation. [On the Taiwan question, China has
dropped many of its previous demands (such as \"one China\" being
defined as the People\'s Republic). As to the South China Sea, China has
allowed the ASEAN Regional Forum to seek a negotiated solution to the
Spratly Islands dispute and also agreed to join the Philippines as
cochairs of the working group on confidence-building measures.89 In
January 2002, China chose to play down an incident that a presidential
jet outfitted in the United States had been crammed with sophisticated
satellite-operated bugs, a decision that, as the New York Times puts it,
\"illustrates the depth of China\'s current commitment to cultivating
better relations with the United States.\"90 Also, over the years, China
has ratified a number of key nonproliferation treaties and pledged not
to assist countries in developing missiles with ranges that exceed the
limits established under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
More recently, China has collaborated with the United States in the war
on terrorism, including issuing new regulations to restrict the export
of missile technology to countries usually accused by the United States
of aiding terrorists.]{.underline} Indeed, as some have argued, by any
reasonable measure China is now more responsible in international
affairs than at any time since 1949.91 And yet, the real problem is
that, so long as the United States continues to stake its self-identity
on the realization of absolute security, no amount of Chinese
cooperation would be enough. For instance, Iain Johnston views the
constructive development of China\'s arms-control policy as a kind of
\"realpolitik adaptation,\" rather than \"genuine learning.\"92 [From
this perspective, however China has changed, it would remain a
fundamentally threatening other, which the United States cannot live
with but has to take full control of. I have argued above that the
\"China threat\" argument in mainstream U.S. IR literature is derived,
primarily, from a discursive construction of otherness. This
construction is predicated on a particular narcissistic understanding of
the U.S. self and on a positivist-based realism, concerned with absolute
certainty and security, a concern central to the dominant U.S.
self-imaginary. **Within these frameworks, it seems imperative that
China be treated as a threatening, absolute other since it is unable to
fit neatly into the U.S.-led evolutionary scheme or guarantee absolute
security for the United States, so that U.S. power preponderance in the
post-Cold War world can still be legitimated.**]{.underline} Not only
does this reductionist representation come at the expense of
understanding China as a dynamic, multifaceted country but it leads
inevitably to a policy of containment that, in turn, tends to enhance
the influence of realpolitik thinking, nationalist extremism, and
hard-line stance in today\'s China. [Even a small dose of the
containment strategy is likely to have a highly dramatic impact on
U.S.-China relations, as the 1995-1996 missile crisis and the 2001
spy-plane incident have vividly attested]{.underline}. **[In this
respect, Chalmers Johnson is right when he suggests that \"a policy of
containment toward China implies the possibility of war, just as it did
during the Cold War vis-à-vis the former Soviet Union]{.underline}**.
The balance of terror prevented war between the United States and the
Soviet Union, but this may not work in the case of China.\"93 [For
instance, as the United States presses ahead with a missiledefence
shield to \"guarantee\" its invulnerability from rather unlikely sources
of missile attacks, it would be almost certain to intensify China\'s
sense of vulnerability and compel it to expand its current small nuclear
arsenal so as to maintain the efficiency of its limited deterrence. In
consequence, it is not impossible that the two countries, and possibly
the whole region, might be dragged into an escalating arms race that
would eventually make war more likely. Neither the United States nor
China is likely to be keen on fighting the other.]{.underline} But as
has been demonstrated, the \"China threat\" argument, for all its
alleged desire for peace and security, tends to make war preparedness
the most \"realistic\" option for both sides. At this juncture, worthy
of note is an interesting comment made by Charlie Neuhauser, a leading
CIA China specialist, on the Vietnam War, a war fought by the United
States to contain the then-Communist \"other.\" Neuhauser says, \"Nobody
wants it. We don\'t want it, Ho Chi Minh doesn\'t want it; it\'s simply
a question of annoying the other side.\"94 And, as we know, in an
unwanted war some fifty-eight thousand young people from the United
States and an estimated two million Vietnamese men, women, and children
lost their lives. Therefore, to call for a halt to the vicious circle of
theory as practice associated with the \"China threat\" literature,
tinkering with the current positivist-dominated U.S. IR scholarship on
China is no longer adequate. [Rather, what is needed is to question this
un-self-reflective scholarship itself, particularly its connections with
the dominant way in which the United States and the West in general
represent themselves and others via their positivist epistemology, so
that alternative, more nuanced, and less dangerous ways of interpreting
and debating China might become possible.]{.underline}

#### Realist international relations theory is too confining of Taiwanese social life -- Taiwan is not a colonial object to be exchanged between the US and China -- our international relations theory must begin from theorizing IR intimately in order to decolonize, de-imperialize, and de-Cold War the region in order to emphasize the actions of ordinary people that serve to undermine tensions in the China/Taiwan borderlands.

Paradigmatic breakthrough: postcolonial 'exit' 4.1 [New realities
Relations between Taiwan and China have been intensifying through daily
intimacies. These range from the concrete (trade and investment,
transportation and tourism) to the sociological (popular culture, family
ties, religious bonds, academic exchanges) to the ideological (revival
of Confucianism)]{.underline}. Concrete exchanges: On 30 June 2009,
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that China can now
invest in Taiwan. Specifically, [Chinese investment may involve '64
sectors in manufacturing, 25 in ser- vices and 11 public infrastructure
projects' (Sung and Ong, 2009). These include real estate (both
commercial and residential), transportation (air- ports and harbor
facilities but limited to less than 50 percent of any venture), and
energy industries (oil and natural gas exploration services, petroleum
products wholesaling, and fuel retailing)]{.underline}. This development
peaks recent trends. In 2007, China was Taiwan's biggest trading
partner, accounting for 28 percent of Taiwan's cross-strait trade valued
at slightly over \$130 billion (Chao, 2009). That same year, China
became Taiwan's largest export market, accounting for 41 percent of the
island's total exports; the mainland was also Taiwan's second- largest
import source at 14 percent of its total (Chao, 2009). Taiwan's Ministry
of Economic Affairs estimates that, as of August 2008, 57 percent of
investments from the island went to the mainland, amounting to
approximately \$71 billion (Chao, 2009). [Transportation and tourism
show similar signs of integration. In April 2009, Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation and China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait agreed to direct flights across the Taiwan Strait.20
Direct weekend flights were announced only a year before, after nearly
60 years of prohibition of any official contact]{.underline} (Asian
Economic News 7 July 2008).21 [In 2007, almost 5 million Taiwanese
visited the mainland (Chao, 2009). Chinese tourists to Taiwan peaked in
2007 with almost 82,000, compared with nearly 54,000 in 2008; however,
the 'mini three links' policy has more than offset this drop.22
Sociological Ties: Audiences in China and Taiwan idolize the same film
stars, singers, and other media celebrities, regardless of national
origin]{.underline} (Kristof, 1991; Lin, 2002). In comparison to the
1960s--1970s, shows from the United States have declined significantly
(Jing, 2008). [These connections in popular culture reflect new
technologies as much as greater migration across the Taiwan Strait.
Since 1987, over 2 million Taiwanese have moved to the mainland,
including 750,000 Taiwanese businessmen]{.underline} (China Times 12
November 2007). [With marriages between Taiwanese and mainlanders
increasing by 40 percent per year (Ibid.), brides from China now
comprise 65% of total 'foreign spouses']{.underline} (waiji peiou) [in
Taiwan, numbering some 290,000 couples]{.underline} (Chao, 2009), [far
exceeding marital unions with other nationalities]{.underline} (Zhuang,
2007). The Sichuan earthquake of 12 May 2008 also solidified
cross-strait relations. [Ordinary citizens and civic groups donated more
than 1 billion renminbi to China to aid the missing or killed in the
earthquake. The Chinese government subsequently re-opened negotiations
for weekend charter flights and other policies in light of this generous
and genuine outpouring of aid and public sentiment in Taiwan. Religion
plays a role as well. Followers of the Mazu religion have been
interacting between Kinman/Matzu]{.underline} (islands belonging to
Taiwan) [and Fujian]{.underline} (a province in China) for decades
(Tsai, 2001).23 In 2002, over 100,000 pilgrims traveled from Taiwan to
Meizhou in Fujian province, despite government prohibitions (Li, 2007).
Today, [the 'mini three links' policy formalizes what had been common
practice between the two sites. And the academy offers a
quasi-governmental yet semi-private site for cross-strait relations.
Faculty and students routinely lecture or conduct research across the
Strait. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council reports that such scholarly
exchanges jumped 1,000 fold in 2007 compared with just a decade
before.]{.underline}24 Ideological affinities: [Confucianism is
returning to post-Mao China (Bell, 2008).25 Note, for example, the
Chinese Communist Party's recent call for a 'harmonious
society']{.underline} (hexie shehui), [based on the Confucian precepts
of unity, morality, and respect for authority]{.underline} (Guo and Guo,
2008).26 [Chinese foreign policy applies another Confucian notion,
'harmony with difference']{.underline} (he er bu tong) (Cao, 2007), to
deflect anxiety, especially in the West (Ikenberry, 2008) about a newly
resurgent, 'muscu- lar' China (Wang, 2005). [With China's return to
Confucianism comes the greatest potential, so far, of an ideological
affinity with Taiwan. Both revere Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who overthrew the
Qing dynasty in 1911 and founded China's contem- porary republican
state.]{.underline}27 [No longer subject to the seemingly immutable
divide between Marxism--Leninism--Mao Zedong thought on the main- land
and liberal--capitalist--Confucianism in Taiwan, the two governing
bodies may now have a common language to talk to and approach each
other]{.underline}. These developments offer new visions of cross-strait
relations. They help to break out of the status quo paradigm of Taiwan
versus China, 'strong sovereignty' versus 'weak sovereignty', 'wing'
versus 'pivot'. 4.2 New visions The Cold War, Chen Kuan-Hsing (2002a, b,
79) points out, constituted Taiwan. This meant a 'worldview, political
and institutional forms, the system of popular knowledge and its
classifications' shaped by a pro-United States and anti-Communist China
ideology. Chen (2007, 47) offers an alternative framework for Taiwan
based on the 'multiple nodal points' (zhidian) of its location in
overlapping and intersected 'life net- works' (wangluo), e.g. 'local
Taiwan' (taiwan zaidi) within 'cross-strait relations' (liang an guanxi)
within a 'Mandarin international' (huawen guoji) within an 'Asian
region' (yazhou quyu) within a 'globalized region' (quanqiu quyu).
Through globalization and the hybridization that results from it, these
new connections reflect Taiwan's mix of colonial and hege- monic
legacies with indigenous cultures and their values (Chen, 2006). Taiwan
needs to restore its relationship with China, Chen stresses. For too
long, Taiwan has treated China as an enemy. [Improved cross- strait
relations could help Taiwan exert its presence, at last, in Asia and the
world]{.underline} (Chen, 2006). For this reason, Chen (2002a, b, 80)
[calls for an intellectual as well as policy move to 'de-colonize' (qu
zhi min), 'de-imperialize' (qu di guo), and 'de-Cold War' (qu leng zhan)
the region. Indeed, Shih (2003) reminds us, 'Taiwan' comes not from the
realist logic of inter-state relations where the state remains a fixed,
unitary, and eternal 'black box'. Rather, 'Taiwan' qualifies more as an
idea con- structed by its leaders. **Taiwan has its own agency and
desires irrespective of United States strategic interests, plans, or
goals -- and has always acted on them, contrary to its portrayal as
helpless and fragile.**]{.underline} The 'rules of the game', Shih
emphasizes, are not decided by the United States alone. For example,
former President Chiang (1978--1988) dis- rupted the US role for Taiwan
in relation to China when he ended martial law in 1987 and allowed
family visits across the straits. [**With such social porousness
dissolving the divide between China and Taiwan, the likelihood of
military action from either side would diminish over time**. This would
give Taiwan the geopolitical space, Shih argues, to 'find its own way',
with or without formal independence]{.underline}. Taiwan, in short, is
not what mainstream analysts presume it is. The island-state is not a
self-enclosed, unitary actor with singularly definable interests like
hating China and loving the United States, maximizing 'pivots' and
minimizing 'wings'. [Taiwan is neither exclusively Chinese nor Japanese
nor American nor, even, 'indigenous' but an amalgam of all these
ethnicities, histories, and politics -- and more. A mix of 'tra- dition'
and 'modernity', 'democratic debate' and 'authoritarian rule',
'patriarchal standards' and 'feminist challenges', Taiwan serves as a
dynamic indicator of contemporary Asia rather than a relic of Cold-War
power politics]{.underline} (Shih and Ling, 1997; Ling and Shih, 1998).
Old political divisions have not only given way but also morphed into
new hybrid sub- jectivities as traffic in people, goods, capital, ideas,
and cultures increase. The geopolitical space between Taiwan and China
is not just shrinking; it is also being transformed. [This postcolonial
sensibility suggests an alternative approach to cross- strait
relations]{.underline}. Elsewhere, we draw on Ang Lee's 2007 film,
'Lust/ Caution', as an allegory for Taiwan and China (Chen et al.,
2009). The film tells of the painful consequences to the bifurcated
national security state ('KMT, nationalist government' versus
'Japanese-run, puppet regime'), personified by the film's two
principals, Wang and Yee, who are lovers but committed to killing each
other. In the end, both die: one physically (by order of her lover); the
other, spiritually (due to this order). No one wins, in other words.
What the paper explores are the liminalities or 'borderlands' that bind
Wang and Yee -- much akin to the 'new realities' identified above for
Taiwan and China -- even as they operate within circumscribed
circumstances ('subaltern straits'). **[Section Skipped]{.underline}**
Conclusion [Cross-strait analysts, whether from Taiwan or China, need to
retrieve their analytical agency. As demonstrated by the reality of
'borderlands' between Taiwan and China, ordinary people have always
acted on their own agency in daily life. Some analysts recognize this
fact and 'voice' new challenges to the complacency and complicity of
'loyalty'. But more radical change awaits us. A paradigmatic
breakthrough or 'exit' looms on the horizon.]{.underline} Recent moves
by both sides indicate as much. Since Ma's election, the heads of the
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (haijihui) and China's Association
For Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (haixiehui) have met in Beijing
as well as Taipei. They have signed agreements on commerce, trade,
investment, and transportation. [And both now empha- size a new
orientation that highlights 'talks' (xieshang) rather than 'opposition'
(duili). The region's subaltern straits may be unraveling, at
last.]{.underline}

#### US international relations politics support Taiwanese regional security and conceptions of sovereign national identity that construe Taiwanese political objectives in opposition to rival schools of Chinese IR theory -- this leaves Taiwanese people in an impossible decision between aligning with China or aligning with the West. The plan perpetuates this violence because it enforces that Taiwan must align with China and therefore be subject to Chinese colonial expansion. The forced choice must be refused -- self-denial provides the only means of interrogating the terms of the question and refusing the conditions of nationalism which are at the root of Chinese/Taiwanese tensions.

**[This chapter has sought to examine the ways in which Chinese IR's
emerging indigenous theories and concepts have been received by Taiwan's
IR scholarship.]{.underline}** Under the influence of various legacies
combined (namely, Japanese colonial rule, Chinese Civil War, and US-led
Cold War), IR scholars there are attentive but not sensitive to the
development of new IR thinking on the other side of the Strait.
**[Rather than make use of their advantage in Chinese language, history,
and culture and join up with their mainland colleagues in building
feasible alternatives to mainstream, Eurocentric theories for genuinely
'global' IR studies, Taiwanese academics tend to evaluate nascent
Chinese IR thinking through an American (and typically realist)
lens.]{.underline}** Despite their subsequent conclusion that it remains
premature to speak of indigenous IR theory-building in China or a
plausible 'Chinese School', **[these Chinese alternatives unexpectedly
pose an epistemological threat to Taiwanese IR scholarship, for they
possess the potential to reveal that the universality associated with
American/Western IR (through which Taiwan obtains a sense of superiority
over China) is at best limited, or that Chinese scholars also have
acquired a good command of American theories and methods (hence
obscuring the assumed differences between Taiwan and
China).]{.underline}** While academics and practitioners of
international relations in Taiwan appear to be good disciples of
American realism, concerning themselves with the balance of power when
facing China's rise, not unlike their ambivalent attitude towards
Chinese new IR thinking, this chapter has illustrated that Taipei's
actual foreign policy behavior towards the PRC is not so much about
balancing (or, for that matter, bandwagoning) in a classical sense.
Rather, it is more about how to balance Taiwan's relationships with
China on the one hand and with the US and Japan on the other. The quest
for relational security has rendered Taiwan's overall approach to China
a mixture of mingling and exclusion, both politically and
intellectually. **[This leads us to an epistemological (and, indeed,
political) question -- is Taiwanese IR scholarship able to understand
new ideas and practices in China's external relations as they are,
unfiltered and unconstrained by any national (Chinese or Japanese) and
civilizational (Confucian and Western) conditions? From the perspective
of Western IR, it is fruitless to contemplate such a possibility because
the nation-state remains the dominant unit of analysis in international
politics.]{.underline}** Postcolonial IR likewise is not interested in
the possibility of transcendence, because it celebrates hybrid
identities capable of switching between different situations. **[But
scholars in China studies communities (especially those located in
China's immediate neighborhood) have been confronting very much the same
question well before the current 'China fever' in the IR discipline, and
some creative suggestions have been proffered]{.underline}** (Chih-yu
Shih 2012). **[A relevant case in point is Takeuchi Yoshimi (1910-1977),
who proposed Asia as a method of constantly becoming a different
entity]{.underline}** (Takeuchi 2005). **[By denying the self from
coming into being in any concrete or substantive sense, Takeuchi's
method of self-denial envisioned a Japan/Asia that would not need to
choose between leader and follower on the one hand and between China and
West on the other.]{.underline}** In other words, **[Asia would not be
reduced into an anti-West instrument under Japan's leadership as seen in
the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (GEACS), or a]{.underline}**
blind **[disciple of Europe that could never catch up with the
instructor, hence avoiding Japan's failed attempts to counter Western
hegemony in the first half of the twentieth century]{.underline}** (for
the project of 'overcoming modernity' backed by some of the most
prominent intellectuals during wartime Japan, see Richard Calichman
2008). Mizoguchi Yuzo (1932-2010) similarly maintained that studying
China can serve as a way for Japan to learn how to understand a
different nation based on the latter's own historical subjectivity,
without taking any specific standpoint. **[From his perspective,
studying China itself is no longer the purpose; rather, it is to
reconsider the structural problems of human history by studying
China]{.underline}** (Mizoguchi 1989). In so doing, Japan could belong
to a truly universal world, rising above any national or civilizational
conditions. The method of self-denial employed by Takeuchi and Mizoguchi
has in fact been practiced several decades ahead by Tsai Pei-huo
(1889-1983), an intellectual and political activist in colonial Taiwan.
**[To advocate for the rights of the Taiwanese, Tsai realized that, as a
colonial subject politically dominated by Japan and culturally dominated
by China, he needed to create a space not belonging strictly to either
Japan or China in order for his arguments to not be dismissed out of
hand by the colonial authorities.]{.underline}** **[The gathering storm
over the Asian continent and the subsequent Japanization campaign,
however, presented the Taiwanese with a dark prospect of choosing Japan
over China.]{.underline}** **[To stay integral and maintain
self-respect, Tsi chose to be neither by resorting to 'East Asia' for
transcending the colonial Japaneseness.]{.underline}** In his 'The Son
of East Asia' (1934), Tsai placed East Asia above national communities:
Taiwan was no longer subordinate to either China or Japan in this
scheme; all of them could become sons of East Asia (Chang 2000). **[To
become an East Asian in Taiwan was an exercise of constant self-denial,
being neither Chinese nor Japanese. Moreover, if all were East Asians,
there would be no need for them to fight each other for expansion, hence
winning respect from other parts of the world.]{.underline}** Borrowing
the Japanese metaphor of God's state to designate the identity of East
Asia, Tsai also sought to persuade the Japanese militarist regime that
the emperor's 'princely way' could only be achieved by peace, leading to
the land of eternal happiness. His conception of East Asia enabled him
to make use of the princely way discourse for occupying the moral high
ground against the war with China under the circumstance of war.
**[Taiwan in Tsai's East Asia became a place where China and Japan could
co-exist in harmony; unlike the confrontational nature exhibited in
Japan's pre-1945 pan-Asianism that attempted to coerce the rest of Asia
and the Western powers simultaneously (i.e. GEACS), East Asia in this
regard was simply an invitation.]{.underline}** Furthermore, since Tsai
focused on the relationship between Japan and China without opposing
Europe/the West, his East Asia was non-threatening to the West. **[To
become an East Asian only required one to retreat far beyond all
national conditions, which, in turn, brought one into what Nishida
Kitaro]{.underline}** (1870-1945) **[called the 'place of
nothingness']{.underline}** (Goto-Jones 2005). It does not seem
unreasonable to suggest that Tsai's scheme actually achieved a higher
level of sophistication than that of the Kyoto School philosophers in
the sense that his **[East Asia rendered it impossible for his retreat
to the place of nothingness to be co-opted or appropriated by the
militarist regime]{.underline}**, as seen in the case of Nishida and his
disciplines (Shimizu 2011). This is not to imply that it would be easy
to pursue Tsai's East Asia as a method of constant self-denial. **[It
should be reminded that Tsai himself was immediately imprisoned after
the publication of the 'Son of East Asia', for shaking the conviction of
the Imperial Army. The fact that Tsai's writings have been largely
ignored in contemporary Taiwan also indicates that the academic and
political climate there is more concerned with the identification of
(simulated) differences between Taiwan and China than with the
transcendence of their relationship.]{.underline}** Indeed, it is
extremely difficult for an East Asian to consciously exercise conceptual
retreat in her/his daily life when permeated by national politics. The
temptation of power eventually led Tsai to serve in the KMT government
as a minister-without-portfolio in the early 1950s, forfeiting his
nascent East Asian identity. **[Nevertheless, Tsai's thinking and
activities demonstrate that intellectual and political exits to Taiwan's
'relational security dilemma' (i.e. choosing between China and the
US/Japan) are immanent, emerging, and possible. Rather than keep
treating new IR thinking in China as a mere research object, Taiwanese
IR scholarship should not forget the possibility of transcendence when
engaging Chinese IR.]{.underline}**

#### The alternative is to reject the aff in favor of critical interrogation of Occidentalism, a fight against Westoxfication, rejecting emotionless rationalism, colonialism, and self-centered individualism through both the distorted images of its targets but also acquiring information about the West.

**Jouhki & Pennanen 16 ("The Imagined West: Exploring Occidentalism",
pg. 2-3, Jukka Jouhki & Henna-Riikka Pennanen)///AR**

Perhaps more often in academic texts the word Occidentalism means
'anti-Westernism', or movements and/or ideologies that reject rather
than advocate ideas, political processes, or material objects labeled
Western (Woltering 2011, 5; Sims 2012: 207). For example, Islamic,
anti-colonial, anti-globalist, and socialist movements have been defined
as Occidentalist (e.g., Buruma and Margalit 2005; Hermes 2012: 8; Chen
2002: 23--42). According to Bryan Turner (1997), **[Occidentalism is
thus a fight against---not advocacy
for---'modernization']{.underline}**. Ian Buruma (2004; see also Spencer
2003: 236-- 250) goes further and describes [**how aggressive
Occidentalism imagines a process of harmful Westernization---or
'Westoxification'---which makes non-Western Occidentalists reject what
is seen as the cold, mechanical West, a machinelike civilization
characterized by emotionless rationalism, cynical secularism,
self-centered individualism, and power-hungry colonialism.** The East,
in contrast, in this kind of counterhegemonic Occidentalism, is a place
where family values, tradition, spirituality, morality, and hard work
are valued]{.underline} (Korhonen 1996, 164--166). Jonathan Spencer
(2003: 236--250; see also Jouhki 2006: 72) describes how non Western
critics of the West view it as the origin and place of rationalism, but
claim that the Western way of practicing rationality has gone too far.
**[Occidentalists of this school argue that one can do almost anything,
however immoral, in the West, and justify it by rationalizing
it.]{.underline}** In general, Occidentalism in Asia is structurally and
functionally similar to Orientalism in the West (whatever that is),
although it differs in being more defensive than offensive (Korhonen
1996: 159--160; see also Takeuchi 2010: 29--30). As Rio Takeuchi (2010:
26--27) claims, **[Occidentalism in Asia exists 'as a strategy devised
by subordinate people for surviving in the hegemonic world order'. He
proposes that Occidentalism is about the perpetuation of distorted
images of its target, but at the same time it is also about 'acquiring
as accurate knowledge of the West as possible'.]{.underline}** For
example, Francis Nymanjoh and Ben Page (2002) have studied Cameroonian
views of 'white people' and whiteness as a symbol of the Occident, and
claim that if upholding an identity requires a competing alter ego (like
the Oriental has been to Western people), then the 'Black Cameroonian
Self ' has been reproduced by creating a 'White European Other'. [Many
Cameroonians question the fantastic stereotype of wealthy but weak
Westerners; however, at the same time they hope that the stereotype is
true, because the hope of accessing the bountiful West through white
people is an essential part of the Cameroonian survival
strategy]{.underline} (Nyamnjoh and Page 2002; see also Jouhki 2006:
154--162). In this article, Occidentalism has a more abstract, simple,
and banal meaning[. It means simply the belief in a coherent
socio-cultural entity called 'the West', which is thought to be
distinctive and homogeneous enough to have its own culture, people, and
society. Occidentalism is thus practiced both by people calling
themselves Western and by people who do not. It includes both the
self-images of Westerners and images of Western society as the
Other.]{.underline} The value statements made about the West can be
either negative or positive, or even mutually contradictory. It does not
matter if there are different images about the West, because as long as
any images exist, there is Occidentalism. [Although we view the West as
an entity that owes its existence to a significant extent to the
collective imagination, this does not mean that it is pure fantasy. Like
any imagined community, the belief in it has some concrete foundation,
as well as very real or practical consequences]{.underline} (Anderson
2006 \[1983\]; Jouhki 2006: 43--44). Being united under a name produces
feelings of affinity and loyalty. This leads people to signify
experiences selectively in a way that buttresses the sense of union. [In
other words, when one labels oneself as a Westerner, one is more
committed to narrating observations in the empirical world as Western.
**Naming ideas, political systems, historical processes, and even
academic disciplines as Western strengthens the Western community.
Moreover, a feeling of belonging to Western culture can lead to
political engagement in that particular collective. If one sees oneself
as a Westerner, one also usually feels politically loyal to 'the
West'.**]{.underline} Thus, to claim that a cultural category such as
the West is an imagined community does not mean that it is not a
relevant and meaningful phenomenon. The West might be fuzzy or imagined,
but it has a true meaning for people and practical ramifications both in
the West and outside of it.

### LINK -- Discourse

#### The affirmative's discourse surrounding China constitutes China as a foreign other to protect American identity. The K is prior---their discourse is part and parcel of the affirmative's policy.

**Turner 13** (Oliver Turner, Research Associate at the Brooks World
Poverty Institute at the University of Manchester. He is the author of
*American Images of China: Identity, Power, Policy* (Routledge,
forthcoming, "'Threatening' China and US security: the international
politics of identity," Review of International Studies, FirstView
Articles, pp 1-22, Cambridge University Press 2013)

In his analysis of the China Threat Theory Chengxin [Pan
argues]{.underline} that [the 'threat' is an imagined construction of
American observers.]{.underline}15 Pan does not deny the importance of
[the PRC\'s capabilities]{.underline} but asserts that they [appear
threatening from understandings about the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [itself]{.underline}. '\[[T\]here is no such thing
as "Chinese reality" that can automatically speak for
itself]{.underline}', Pan argues. '\[[T\]o fully understand the US
"China threat" argument, it is essential to recognize its
autobiographical nature']{.underline}.16 The geographical territory of
China, then, is not separate from or external to, American
representations of it. Rather, it is actively constitutive of those
representations.17 The analysis which follows demonstrates that [China
'threats' to the U]{.underline}nited [St]{.underline}ates
[have]{.underline} to some extent [always been established and
perpetuated through representation and discourse.]{.underline} Michel
[Foucault described discourse as 'the general domain of all statements',
constituting either a group of individual statements or a regulated
practice which accounts for a number of statements.]{.underline}18
American discourse of China can therefore be manifest as disparate and
single statements about that country or as collectives of related
statements such as the China Threat Theory. Ultimately, [American
representations of China are discursive constructions of truths or
realities about its existence]{.underline}. The article draws in part
from the work of David [Campbell]{.underline} who [suggests]{.underline}
that [dangers in the international realm are]{.underline} invariably
[threats to understandings about the self. 'The mere existence of an
alternative mode of being', argues Campbell, 'the presence of which
exemplifies that different identities are possible]{.underline} ... [is
sometimes enough to produce the understanding of a
threat.']{.underline}19 As a result, [**interpretations of global
danger** can be traced to the processes by which states are made foreign
from one another through discourses of separation and
difference]{.underline}.20 In this analysis it is demonstrated that
[particular American discourses have historically made the US foreign
from China.]{.underline} Case study one for example demonstrates that
[nineteenth-century racial discourses of non-white immigrant Chinese
separated China from a U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates largely
[defined by its presumed Caucasian foundations.]{.underline} In case
study two we see that [Cold War ideological discourses of communism
distanced the PRC from the democratic-capitalist US. These types of
discourses are shown to have **constituted a 'specific sort of
boundary** producing political performance']{.underline}.21 Across the
history of Sino-US relations then [when 'dangers' from China have
emerged, they have always been perceived through the lens of American
identity.]{.underline} In consequence, [they have always existed as
dangers to that identity]{.underline}. In this analysis it is argued
that [a key purpose of depicting China as a threat has been to **protect
components of American identity**]{.underline} (primarily racial and
ideological) [deemed most fundamental to its being]{.underline}. As
such, [representations of a threatening China have most commonly been
advanced by, and served the interests of, those who support actions to
defend that identity.]{.underline} The case study analyses which follow
reveal that [this has included politicians and policymaking circles,
such a]{.underline}s those within the administration of President Harry
[Truman which implemented the Cold War containment of the PRC. It also
exposes the complicity of other societal individuals and institutions
including elements of the late nineteenth-century American media which
supported restrictions against Chinese immigration to the western
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. It is demonstrated that, twice
before, [this **discursive process** of separating China from the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has **resulted in a crisis of
American identity**. Crises of identity occur when the existing order is
considered in danger of rupture. The prevailing authority is seen to be
weakened and rhetoric over how to reassert the 'natural' identity
intensifies]{.underline}.22 Case studies one and two expose how [such
crises]{.underline} have previously emerged. These moments [were
characterised by perceived attacks upon core assumptions about what the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [was understood to be:
fundamentally white in the late nineteenth century and
democratic-capitalist in the early Cold War.]{.underline} Case study
three shows that [while today\'s China 'threat' to US security is yet to
generate such a crisis, we must learn from those of the past to help
avoid the types of consequences they have previously
facilitated]{.underline}. As Director Clapper unwittingly confirmed then
[the capabilities and intentions of a 'rising' China are only part of
the story. International relations are driven by forces both material
and ideational and the **processes by which China is made foreign**
from, and potentially dangerous to, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [are **inseparable from the enactment of US China
policy**. This is because]{.underline}, to reaffirm, [American
discourses of China have never been produced objectively or in the
absence of purpose or intent.]{.underline} [Their dissemination is a
performance of power, however seemingly innocent or
benign.]{.underline}23 [This is]{.underline} not to claim causal
linkages between representation and foreign policy. Rather, it is [to
reveal the specific historical conditions within which policies have
occurred, through an analysis of the political history of the production
of truth.]{.underline}24 Accordingly, [this analysis shifts from a
concern with 'why' to 'how' questions. 'Why' questions assume that
particular practices can happen by taking for granted the identities of
the actors involved]{.underline}.25 [They assume]{.underline}, for
instance, [the availability of a range of policy options in Washington
from the self-evident existence of a China threat. 'How' questions
investigate the production of identity and the processes which
ensure]{.underline} that [particular practices can be enacted while
others are precluded]{.underline}.26 In this analysis they are concerned
with how and why China 'threats' have come to exist, who has been
responsible for their production and how those socially constructed
dangers have established the necessary realities within which particular
US foreign policies could legitimately be advanced. [US China
policy]{.underline}, however, [must not be narrowly conceived as a
'bridge' between two states.]{.underline}27 In fact, [it works on behalf
of societal discourses about China to reassert the understandings of
difference upon which it relies.]{.underline}28 [Rather than a final
manifestation of representational processes]{.underline}, then, [US
China policy itself works to construct China\'s identity as well as that
of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. As the case study
analyses show, [it perpetuates discursive difference through the
rhetoric and actions]{.underline} (governmental acts, speeches, etc.)
[by which it is advanced and the reproduction of a China 'threat'
continues. In such a way it constitutes the international 'inscription
of foreignness', protecting American values and identity when seemingly
threatened by that of China.]{.underline}29 As Hixson asserts,
'\[f\]oreign policy plays a profoundly significant role in the process
of creating, affirming and disciplining conceptions of national
identity', and [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has always
been especially dependent upon representational practices for
understandings about its identity]{.underline}.30 In sum, this article
advances three principal arguments. First, [throughout history 'threats'
from China towards the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have
never been explicable in terms of material forces alone. They
have]{.underline} in part [been fantasised, socially constructed
products of American discourse. The physical contours of Sino-American
relations have been given meaning by processes of representation so that
China has repeatedly been made threatening no matter its
intentions]{.underline}. Second, [representations of China 'threats'
have always been key to the enactment and justification of US foreign
policies formulated in response. Specifically, they have **framed the
boundaries of political possibility** so that certain policies could be
enabled while potential alternatives could be discarded.]{.underline}
Third, [US China policies themselves have reaffirmed discourses of
foreignness and the identities of both China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [functioning to protect the American identity from
which the 'threats' have been produced]{.underline}.

### LINK -- Occidental Projection

#### The idea of the West has become fetishized as a form of coherence; those who identify with the West is a form of symbolic geography and a form of control that reinforces Western norms, papering over differences in favor of coherence. 

**Jouhki & Pennanen 16 ("The Imagined West: Exploring Occidentalism",
pg. 7, Jukka Jouhki & Henna-Riikka Pennanen)//annierhee**

The West might refer to the process of, and the culture surrounding,
capitalism and wealth formation (Coronil 1996: 62--64); or it might
refer to a multi-layered and complex whole called modernization (Ahiska:
357--365). People choose their narratives, and they might say, for
example, that they oppose things 'Western', when they actually oppose
certain technological developments, political processes, or gender roles
which are associated with a fuzzy entity called the West (e.g., Ahiska
258--365). According to Fernando Coronil (1996: 78), [it is surprising
how many people think that the West is the place and source of
modernity. In his opinion the West has been naturalized and fetishized
to an autonomous entity. Populations identified by the common signifier
seem as if they are living isolated lives, and their characteristics
spring from the internal attributes of their selectively imagined
history and culture. They come together under the label of 'Western
world', 'Western society,' or 'Western people']{.underline} (Coronil
1996: 77--78; see also Boatcă 2015: 78--80). In the end, Occidentalism
falls into the very human tendency to practice symbolic geography. [It
reveals the way we identify and define ourselves by locating ourselves
spatially and temporally, by drawing the boundaries of discursively
constructed social spaces we imagine ourselves to be in.]{.underline}
This socially and historically situated process is anthropologically
important, because it has an intimate relationship to the formation of
identities and identity politics. **[It is also a form of social
control. By repeating what the West and a Westerner are like, norms are
enforced and reinforced. This kind of mental mapping of the West
emphasizes shared patterns at the cost of differences. In other words,
we ignore our differences in order to feel united, and we fabricate
ourselves into coherence]{.underline}** (Carrier 2003: 9; Péteri 2010:
2--3; Bhatnagar 1986: 3--5). The West as a source of identity is often
'a massive body of self-congratulating ideas'. What researchers studying
culture should do is not necessarily draw a better map of the West, but
unmask the rhetoric that creates it (Clifford 1988: 265; Jouhki 2006:
51). Anthropology has traditionally examined the so-called nonWestern
Other, and in so doing the explicit or implicit views of the
West---however carefully constructed, naïve, or taken-for-granted---that
anthropologists hold have been central to the way they have understood
and represented it.

2 Strategies for negotiation: exit, voice, and loyalty Hirschman
identified 'exit', 'voice', and 'loyalty' as three strategies for
negotiation between two asymmetrical parties: unions and management.
'Exit' refers to leaving the situation altogether by quitting the scene,
finding another job, transferring, or some other means of self-removal.
'Voice' articulates a specific program or counter-proposal to bargain
with management on a peer basis. And 'loyalty' specifies just that:
compliance with management demands. Each strategy represents a discrete
act by workers (or their collectivity, the union) in relation to the
more powerful and well-endowed managers. This management--union analogy
applies to United States--Taiwan relations. [Taiwan received substantial
US aid from the end of World War II to the 1970s (Jacoby, 1966; Wu,
1988), thereby enabling the United States to shape (one could say
'restructure') Taiwan in the areas of labor, security, and consumption,
specifically, to accommodate America's needs and interests during the
Cold War.2 Taiwan has developed significantly since this initial period
of tutelage under the United States, but the island-state remains deeply
embedded within the US orbit politically, militarily, economically, and
culturally.]{.underline} Indeed, [Taiwan's sex industry epitomizes this
workmanlike relationship in a subaltern context, most prominently during
the Vietnam War, when local prostitutes and pimps systematically
serviced US military bases stationed in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Keelung, and
Hualien (Huang, 1976; Wang, 1984).3 With the withdrawal of US bases in
1979, businessmen from the United States, Europe, and Japan have made up
the difference in Taiwan's thriving sex trade]{.underline} (Human
Trafficking Website, 2007--2008).4 To adjust Hirschman's strategies for
a postcolonial Taiwan, we draw on Ling's (2002a) differentiation between
'formal' and 'substantive' mimicry to refine 'exit', 'voice', and
'loyalty' in cross-strait relations. [Formal mimicry refers to
superficial imitation by the subaltern of the master or hegemon;
substantive mimicry adapts the hegemonic model to local traditions,
norms, practices, and institutions to arrive at a new, hybrid way of
thinking, doing, and being. It is the latter, we argue, that triggers
the possibility of transforming the colonial or hegemonic
relationship.]{.underline} Put in Hirschman's terms, [formal mimicry
personifies 'loyalty'; substantive mimicry, a new 'voice' that
negotiates with the hegemon with self-confidence and self-respect. With
maturation, 'voice' can help to foster a paradigmatic breakthrough or
'exit'.]{.underline} [An 'exit' discourse resonates in Taiwan today,
softly at first but perhaps in full chorus over time]{.underline}. To
begin, let us review the mainstream discourse in the United States on
relations between Taiwan and China. 3 The mainstream discourse: Cold War
redux 3.1 The United States Mainstream analysts in the United States
maintain the official position of a 'one-China policy.' That is, the
United States should abide by the United States -- China communiques of
1972, 1979, and 19825 and the Taiwan Relations Act (Lampton, 1986,
2003). The US analysts encourage Taiwan and China to engage in dialogue
to resolve the cross-strait crisis 'peacefully' (Clough, 2001a, b, 2002,
2003). [Three competing policies have emerged under this general rubric:
(i) 'strategic ambiguity', (ii) 'double deterrence', and (iii) 'interim
agreements'. Each accords the United States a different role in the
region and relations with Taiwan and China, respectively. 'Strategic
ambiguity' keeps them guessing, in other words. By refusing to declare
whether it would aid Taiwan militarily should China attack, the United
States could deter both from reckless endangerment to them- selves and
the region]{.underline} (Solomon, 1978; Oksenberg, 1982; Johnson, 1997;
Tucker, 1998; Nathan, 2000). After all, mainstream analysts claim, the
United States has no vested interest in the final outcome so long as the
settlement is reached peacefully. ['Double deterrence' makes the above
explicit. That is, the United States actively opposes China's resort to
military force and any moves from Taiwan toward formal independence.
Indeed, double deterrence links the two: that is, China's renunciation
of force is contingent upon Taiwan's rejection of independence. In
practice, double deterrence trans- lates into 'no unification, no
independence.' It requires the United States, also, to take on a direct,
mediating role between Taiwan and China. 'Interim agreements' seek to
normalize relations between China and Taiwan with signed
'contracts']{.underline} (Tucker, 1998; Lampton and May, 1999; Nathan,
2000). Taiwan would abjure from seeking independence for 50 years in
exchange for China's renunciation of military action on the island. Like
strategic ambiguity and double deterrence, the interim agree- ments
approach has zero tolerance of military force by China against Taiwan.
But unlike the previous two proposals, the interim agreements would
demand that Taiwan and China sign a formal concession. Of the three
approaches, double deterrence prevails primarily by default (Council on
Foreign Relations, 1995; Robinson, 1996; Tucker, 2002). [Neither Taiwan
nor China supports strategic ambiguity given that each distrusts US
intentions. China suspects the United States will not accept Taiwan's
eventual return to the mainland, just as Taiwan questions whether the
United States would support the island-state's bid for formal
independence]{.underline} (Nathan, 2000). Nor does the interim approach
fare any better. For Taiwan, this would entail de facto abandonment of
any kind of independence based on an unenforceable and unreliable
promise from China. As for China, how could it give up a sovereign right
to arms, especially for a 'domestic' matter? Double deterrence, US
analysts con- clude, remains the only acceptable option for all three
parties. [These approaches reproduce the Taiwan--China crisis. Each
assumes (i) an immutable sovereignty that (ii) divides the two entities
into eter- nally hostile camps, thereby (iii) disabling them from
managing this problem for themselves. Taiwan and China are portrayed as
perpetual enemies; accordingly, they treat each other in zero-sum terms.
Moreover, all three approaches present the United States as the only
arbiter avail- able and capable of intervening in the region, either
indirectly by framing the terms of debate and strategic interaction or
directly through state-to-state mediation.]{.underline} Still,
mainstream analysts in Taiwan agree to United States prescrip- tions for
cross-strait relations. Their compliance reflects two types of hegemonic
loyalty at work: formal and substantive mimicry. The former subdivides
additionally into positive and fearful loyalty. 3.2 Taiwan6 Mainstream
analysts in Taiwan demand 'strong sovereignty' based on a sense of
national dignity, not just right to exist. This position aims, in
particular, to differentiate Taiwan from its ideological Other, China.7
[Mainstream analysts proclaim Taiwan a model of liberal capitalism,
democracy, and independence. Accordingly, Taiwan is/must/should be a
prized member of the Club of (Western) Modernity. China, in contrast, is
demonized as authoritarian, underdeveloped, and possibly a new colo-
nizing master. Mainstream analysts believe that this dual strategy of
mimicking the United States and demonizing China empowers the Taiwanese
state, seen as key to resolving the cross-strait 'crisis'.8 But, we
argue, this construction of United States--China--Taiwan relations pro-
tracts the crisis by inflating the role of the US, provoking China, and,
contrary to all avowed intentions, denigrating Taiwan -- even with a new
President and new Administration in offic]{.underline}e. New president,
new administration, old policies. President Ma Ying-jeou won a landslide
victory in March 2008. Representing a new, post-Chiang generation of
Kuomintang (KMT) leadership, Ma's election seemed to augur a new era in
cross-strait relations. It upset the previous ruling party, the
Democratic People's Party (DPP), which had vowed 'indepen- dence' for
the island. Within two months, the Ma Administration initiated weekend
charter flights between Taiwan and China. Taiwan also allowed more
tourists from the mainland to visit. Constructive talks were held
between the Strait Exchange Foundation (haijihui) and its counter- part
on the mainland, the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait
(haixiehui). In his inauguration speech, however, Ma reiterated the
longstanding US-sanctioned policy of 'no unification, no independence,
and no use of force' (butong, budu, buwu).9 Indeed, then Secretary of
the State Condoleezza Rice raised this issue in an interview in the Wall
Street Journal on 19 June 2008.10 Prominent China/Taiwan analysts in the
US cautioned Taiwan to improve relations with China 'gingerly': that is,
not to tilt toward the mainland.11 They advised against 'free-riding';
hence, they urged the Ma Administration to continue purchasing weapons
from the United States to demonstrate Taiwan's 'determination' to defend
itself from China.12 Taiwan's defense intellectuals couldn't agree
more.13 For Edward I-hsin Chen (2008a--c), Taiwan cannot afford to
ignore the United States given the former's complete dependence on the
latter for diplomatic and cross-strait relations. He urges Taiwan to
keep buying weapons from the United States and carefully consider the
proposal for a 'diplomatic truce' to prevent China from taking advantage
of Taiwan.14 Lo (2008) used to criticize the United States for applying
a double standard vis-a\`-vis Taiwan's democratic referendum but now
harshly accuses President Ma of abandoning democratic values and
embracing 'Chinese nationalism'. Many urge the new president to buy
enough weapons to bolster Taiwan's self-defense while not alienating the
island's two chief allies, the United States and Japan (Zhang, 2008a, b;
Lan, 2008; Li, 2008; Liu, 2008[). Demonizing China also continues in
official circles. The newly elected Chair of the DPP, Tsai Ing-wen,
compared the Beijing Olympics with the 1936 Berlin Olympics, thereby
analogizing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to Hitler's Nazi regime
(Tsai, 2008). These positions reflect a longstanding policy of loyalty
to or formal mimicry of US 'leadership' in the Asia-Pacific. Loyalty
(formal mimicry). 'Loyalty' or formal mimicry in Taiwan seeks closer
ties to the US, even under conditions of subalternity. These include
mimicry in concepts, methods, policies, and rhetoric, as well as the
mainstream's internalization of US neocolonial attitudes toward
themselves, the Taiwanese Other.]{.underline}

The Cold War is far from over in the Asia-Pacific. [Mainstream analysts
continue to rely on Cold War concepts, strategies, and rhetoric to
resolve what these have created and propped up for the past half
century. Paradigmatic fixation alone does not account for such
'intellectual inertia']{.underline} (Kuhn, 1962). [It stems also from
local leaders and analysts per- petuating US hegemony, not necessarily
through foreign policy and inter- state relations alone, but also in
subtler, less formal ways that are just as institutionalized and
binding: that is, ways of thinking about and solving
problems.]{.underline} A prime example comes from **[the Taiwan--China
'crisis'. It rests on an 'international' discourse of national security
directed by the United States, but locally supported, distributed, and
reproduced in the state's policy- making apparatus in conjunction with
society's knowledge-producing insti- tutions]{.underline}**. This
national security discourse casts Taiwan as a small, helpless, and
feminized subaltern subject in need of protection from virile, liberal
America against a rapacious, communist China intent on reclaiming 'lost'
territory. What risks truly getting lost, we argue, is transforming
cross-strait relations from 'crisis' to something akin to
'compatibility'. Indeed, [new rea- lities and new visions are emerging
in Taiwan and these bear significant implications for future relations
with China. But mainstream analysts in both Taiwan and the United States
overlook, dismiss, or deny these devel- opments due to their
unreflective internalization of US hegemony. We call this condition
'subaltern straits'. Subalternity refers to the subordination of a
state, society, or group of people in service to a ruling master. The
master can take various forms: for example, a military com- mander, a
colonial metropole, a dominant market, a ruling ideology, an imperial
infrastructure, or a global hegemon. Given these asymmetrical relations,
subalternity often provokes a pattern of emulation or
'mimicry']{.underline} (Bhabha, 1994). [**The subaltern mimics the
master not just to survive but to survive well, given the hegemonic
structure that dominates both**. In today's US-led world politics,
national or **social mimicry can entail building major institutions like
a 'parliament' or 'independent press', importing political rhetoric like
'democracy' and 'freedom', applying economic practices like
'liberalization' and 'privatization', copying cul- tural representations
in fashion, film, and the like, and depicting personal identity as
'individual' and 'self-interested'**]{.underline} (Ling, 2002b). In this
paper, we broaden these notions of subalternity and mimicry. We treat
subalternity as a dynamic, not fixed, condition whereby [the sub-
altern's mimicry of the master does not only destabilize their power
asymmetry (as suggested by Bhabha), but also render it no longer rel-
evant. That is, mimicry puts the subaltern in the master's place with
the potential of transforming the relationship. Taiwan's mimicry of the
United States, we argue, is doing just that]{.underline}. We proceed
accordingly. We begin by drawing on Hirschman's (1970) notions of
'exit', 'voice', and 'loyalty' to categorize the discourse on
cross-strait relations. For Hirschman, these typologize the strategies
avail- able to unions during contract disputes with management. We apply
this typology to negotiations between the United States and Taiwan, in
par- ticular, given similar structural asymmetries. ['Loyalty' and
'voice', for example, characterize Taiwan's mainstream discourse on
cross-strait relations that follows the US lead, locking both in a
Cold-War logic]{.underline}.[1 Most emblematic is the 'triangulation'
model, originally formulated for United States--China--Soviet relations,
now applied to United States-- China -- Taiwan, yet retaining the same
colonizing frames for race, gender, sexuality, class, and
nationality.]{.underline}

### IMPACT -- Cyber Spyfare

#### Orientalist discourse has framed China as both valuable but also as a child who needs guidance. This discourse has been used to justify state policies and practices of cyber spyfare from the US on China. 

**Ooi and D'Arcangelis 17 (Su-Mei Ooi, Gwen D'Arcangelis, « Framing
China : Discourses of othering in US news and political rhetoric",**
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2059436418756096>)//annierhee

The construction of China as potential enemy Other takes on an
additional hue when we look at the depictions of China's cyber
activities---China moves from cheat to a more malicious cousin, the
thief. [The United States first focused on issues of "cyber warfare" in
the mid-2000s to late 2000s, but at the time, the trope associated with
China was not necessarily that of thief. In the mass news media, a
militaristic lens framed much of the discussion, depicting China as a
rule breaker flouting international norms and thus posing a security
threat.]{.underline} For example, a Los Angeles Times article
highlighted that "China in the last year has developed ways to
infiltrate and manipulate computer networks around the world in what
U.S. defense officials conclude is a new and potentially dangerous
military capability, according to a Pentagon report" (Barnes, 2008).
China is even placed in relation to al-Qaeda: "Cyber-attacks and
cyber-espionage pose a greater potential danger to U.S. national
security than Al Qaeda and other militants that have dominated America's
global focus since Sept. 11, 2001, the nation's top intelligence
officials said Tuesday" (Dilanian, 2013). This juxtaposition with
al-Qaeda only served to heighten the military valence of China's cyber
activities, and a push to prepare for such a threat. Indeed, in the
words of Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL): "The threat, to be sure, is
real---and, we cannot allow ourselves to grow complacent ..." (Nelson
2008[). Snowden's revelations of US spying on China in June of 2013
drastically changed the shape of the discussion however. Snowden
demonstrated that the NSA (1) had two data centers in China from which
it had been inserting spy software into vulnerable computers; (2)
targeted the Chinese University of Hong Kong, public officials,
businesses, and students; (3) hacked mobile phones; and (4) in 2009,
hacked the Pacnet headquarters in Hong Kong, which runs one of the
biggest regional fibre-optic networks. In response to Snowden's
revelations, a spate of articles compared the United States' and China's
hacking, displaying a range of attitudes from journalists---some
espoused that both countries demonstrate equivalent transgressive
behavior, while others argued that China has crossed the line into more
aggressive hacking that goes beyond the United States' more benign
"preemptive" hacking. **The latter attitude indicates the resilience of
tropes of the Yellow and Red Perils, a China whose inherent ideological
and cultural differences with the West makes it a threat. The different
lenses through which journalists and pundits viewed China's spying in
comparison with that of the United States further invoke this
Orientalist demarcation.**]{.underline} An article in The Washington
Post thus contrasts China's behavior against that of the United States,
which merely seeks "to examine huge amounts of communication metadata
around the world to look for trends" and "to preempt some threat against
the U.S." China's spying is described, however, as "infiltrating almost
every powerful institution in Washington, D.C.," "breaking into major
news organizations," "stealing sensitive military technology," and
"stealing so much intellectual property that China's hacking has been
called the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'" (Fisher, 2013).
Drawing in particular on incendiary words like "stealing" and
"infiltrating," this article distinguishes China as a sneaky thief. US
journalists and pundits, in charging China with stealing economic
resources, have further solidified the demarcation of China as an
inferior and dangerous Other. A well-circulated quote by national
security pundit Adam Segal stated, "The problem is we're not talking
about the same things ... We're trying to make a distinction between
cyber economic espionage and normal political-military espionage. The
Chinese don't make that same distinction" (Bengali & Dilanian, 2015).
**[By portraying China as unable to grasp the fundamental distinction
between economics and national security, Segal suggests China's thievery
is connected to a more fundamental character flaw---China is unable to
grasp proper civilized norms. Similarly, US official response has been
that China's view of data collection as a sovereign right has rendered
them essentially different from the United States and by implication,
the civilized world.]{.underline}** That Chinese governmental espionage
involves the collection of economic intelligence that is shared with
Chinese companies further departs from civilized norms. Michael Rogers,
Director of the National Security Agency thus explained that "they
clearly don't have the same lines in the sand, if you will, with that
regard" (Bennett, 2015). Historically, US depictions of China as
uncivilized have occurred whenever China has gained power or threatened
US interests. **[The narrative of China as a sort of child following in
the United States' footsteps on the path to modernity has proven
exceedingly popular since World War II and frames the US approach to
China as a potential ally and resource who at the same time may never be
civilizable]{.underline}** (Kim, 2010; Vukovich, 2012**[). In this
Orientalist narrative, China's journey to modernity is always understood
as precarious and, moreover, subject to US vigilance as to whether it
meets the appropriate benchmarks]{.underline}**. The title of an
editorial in The Washington Post epitomizes current iterations of this
sentiment and the ease with which Orientalist imagery can be invoked to
portray China's path to modernity as needing US guidance when China
falls out of line: "The US Needs to Tame the Cyber-Dragon: Stronger
Measures are Need\[ed\] to Block China's Economic Espionage \[emphasis
mine\]" ("The U.S. Needs to Tame," 2013). In reality, US vigilance can
be attributed to the concern since the end of the Cold War, that a
"sleeping giant" able to challenge US global hegemony is awakening (Kim,
2010). **[Thus, the cultural work done by portrayals of China as unable
to adhere to civilized norms serve to bolster the image of China as
perpetually unprepared to be a responsible member of the international
community. In fact, this narrative of China's thievery serves to
persuade the American public that China is a threat to the international
community.]{.underline}** One Wall Street Journal journalist perfectly
echoes this sentiment: A China that leads the world in the theft of
intellectual property, computer hacking and resource nationalism will
prove extremely destabilizing. If it continues on this course, Beijing
should not be surprised if other countries begin to band together to
collectively counter some of the more harmful implications of China's
rise. A better outcome for all will be for China to embrace its
responsibilities to help lead the world ... (Metzl, 2011) This article,
although hopeful that China may at some future point become a
responsible global actor, even leader, ultimately reifies the notion
that an increase in China's global power is always suspect.

### IMPACT -- DEHUMANIZATION

#### Western exceptionalism causes imperialism, endless war, and dehumanization

**Said 78** (Edward Said, Orientalism)//e-toth

[Reflection, debate, rational argument, moral principle based on a
secular notion that human beings must create their own history have been
replaced by abstract ideas that celebrate American or Western
exceptionalism,]{.underline} denigrate the relevance of context, and
regard other cultures with derisive contempt. Perhaps you will say that
I am making too many abrupt transitions between humanistic
interpretation on the one hand and foreign policy on the other, and that
a modern technological society that, along with unprecedented power,
possesses the internet and F-16 fighter jets must in the end be
commanded by formidable technical-policy experts like Donald Rumsfeld
and Richard Perle. (Neither man will do any actual fighting since that
will be left to less fortunate men and women.) But [what has really been
lost is a sense of the density and interdependence of human life, which
can neither be reduced to a formula nor be brushed aside as irrelevant.
Even the language of the war is dehumanizing in the extreme: \"We\'ll go
in there take out Saddam, destroy his army with clean surgical strikes,
and everyone will think it\'s great,\"]{.underline} said a congresswoman
on national television. It seems to me entirely symptomatic of the
precarious moment in which we are living that [when Vice President
Cheney made his hard-line speech on August 26, 2002, about the
imperative to attack Iraq, he quoted as his single Middle East
\"expert\" in support of military intervention against Iraq an Arab
academic who, as a paid consultant to the mass media on a nightly basis,
keeps repeating his hatred of his own people and the renunciation of his
background. Moreover, he is backed in his efforts by the military and
Zionist lobbies in the United States. Such a trahison de clercs is a
symptom of how genuine humanism can degenerate into jingoism and false
patriotism.]{.underline}

### IMPACT -- US/China War

#### Violent discursive tropes pin and are used to justify hardline, aggressive policies towards China. 

**Ooi and D'Arcangelis 17 (Su-Mei Ooi, Gwen D'Arcangelis, « Framing
China : Discourses of othering in US news and political rhetoric",**
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2059436418756096>)//annierhee

Peter Hays Gries once suggested that the way Americans view China is
most likely motivated by "cold calculations of their own self-interest
... intertwined with deep-seated 'gut feelings' about China" (Hays
Gries, 2006, p. 209). And while we "frequently infer Chinese intentions
from Chinese capabilities," admitting to these features in US policy is
something that we are often unwilling to do (Gries, 2006). [China has,
since the end of the Cold War, occupied a space in the US imaginary as
the potential enemy Other, and the areas of contention highlighted above
have become ample context for the reification of negative images of
China as an imminent source of threat.]{.underline} **[These images have
been drawn from older tropes of the Yellow and Red Perils and also newer
incarnations of the "sleeping" or "awakened" giant.]{.underline}** **[As
previous work has shown, such tropes have the ability to do the cultural
work that shapes and justifies US policies]{.underline}** (Buzan &
Wæver, 2003; de Buitrago, 2012; Steuter & Wills, 2010; Turner, 2014).
**[In the present moment, negative images of China have enabled the
justification of an increasingly hardline approach to China.
The]{.underline}** latest National Security Strategy articulated by the
Trump administration has unequivocally named China a challenger to
"American power, influence and interests" who has attempted to "erode
American security and prosperity" (Landler & Sanger, 2017; U.S. White
House Office, 2017), and the United States' hardline tack toward China
has been further reflected in the areas of contention in the US--China
Comprehensive Dialogue. **[We have aimed to interrupt post--Cold War
representations of China as a potential enemy Other that encourage a
reductive attitude toward a "rising China." We have been particularly
concerned with how this may disable the US public from fairly evaluating
China's actions as a rising power, as well as the US government's
policies toward China. Indeed, if China is essentially a lawless bully,
a thief, and a cheat incapable of learning international norms of
acceptable behavior, what options besides the exercise of hard power
does the United States have to meet its long-term security
objectives?]{.underline}** A treatise on the aims and modes of US
national security is beyond the scope of this article, but we hope to at
least foreground the way othering frames the "truths" about China, so
that the wider public may view US China policy with a more critical
filter. The ability of the US public to do so could become increasingly
important---diversionary wars have been used as a tactic to shore up
public support for unpopular leaders threatened by domestic discontent,
after all (Sobek, 2007). Although China's longtime position has been to
maintain a strong partnership with the US based on mutual interest,
benefit, and respect, it is imperative that the US public understands
when US policy encourages China to retreat from that position, and the
potential that holds for conflict.

### ALTERNATIVE -- UNDERCOMMONS

#### The alternative is to steal the affirmative -- steal it away to the undercommons of enlightenment, into an alternative theory of being together that transcends the ethos of self-possession instituted by the affirmatives theory of international relations. If the only option for Taiwanese people is to be in the place that is no-place, the undercommons is that place, the no-place and no-time of the subversive intellectual.

**Moten & Harney, 13** (Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, "The
Undercommons", minor compositions,

Date Accessed: July 21 2019) // radronning

**["To the university I'll steal, and there I'll steal,"]{.underline}**
to borrow from Pistol at the end of Henry V, as he would surely borrow
from us. **[This is the only possible relationship to the American
university today]{.underline}**. This may be true of universities
everywhere. It may have to be true of the university in general. But
certainly, this much is true in the United States: [it cannot be denied
that the university is a place of refuge, and it cannot be accepted that
the university is a place of enlightenment]{.underline}. **[In the face
of these conditions one can only sneak into the university and steal
what one can. To abuse its hospitality, to spite its mission, to join
its refugee colony, its gypsy encampment, to be in but not of -- this is
the path of the subversive intellectual in the modern
university.]{.underline}** [Worry about the university. This is the
injunction today in the United States, one with a long
history.]{.underline} Call for its restoration like Harold Bloom or
Stanley Fish or Gerald Graf. Call for its reform like Derek Bok or Bill
Readings or Cary Nelson. [Call out to it as it calls to
you.]{.underline} But [for the subversive intellectual, all of this goes
on upstairs, in polite company, among the rational men.]{.underline}
[After all, **the subversive intellectual came under false pretenses**,
with bad documents, out of love]{.underline}. **[Her labor is as
necessary as it is unwelcome. The university needs what she bears but
cannot bear what she brings]{.underline}**. And on top of all that, she
disappears. [She disappears into the underground, the downlow lowdown
maroon community of the university, **into the undercommons of
enlightenment, where the work gets done, where the work gets subverted,
where the revolution is still black, still strong.**]{.underline} What
is that work and what is its social capacity for both reproducing the
university and producing fugitivity? If one were to say teaching, one
would be performing the work of the university. **[Teaching is merely a
profession and an operation of that onto-/auto-encyclopedic circle of
the state" that Jacques Derrida calls the Universitas. But it is useful
to invoke this operation to glimpse the hole in the fence where labor
enters, to glimpse its hiring hall, its night quarters]{.underline}**.
**[The university needs teaching labor,]{.underline}** despite itself,
or as itself, self-identical with and thereby erased by it. **[It is not
teaching that holds this social capacity, but something that produces
the not visible other side of teaching, a thinking through the skin of
teaching toward a collective orientation to the knowledge object as
future project, and a commitment to what we want to call the prophetic
organization. But it is teaching that brings us in]{.underline}**.
Before there are grants, research, conferences, books, and journals
there is the experience of being taught and of teaching. Before the
research post with no teaching, before the graduate students to mark the
exams, before the string of sabbaticals, before the permanent reduction
in teaching load, the appointment to run the Center, the consignment of
pedagogy to a discipline called education, before the course designed to
be a new book, teaching happened. [T**he moment of teaching for food is
therefore often mistakenly taken to be a stage, as if eventually one
should not teach for food. If the stage persists, there is a social
pathology in the university. But if the teaching is successfully passed
on, the stage is surpassed, and teaching is consigned to those who are
known to remain in the stage, the sociopathological labor of the
university**. Kant interestingly calls such a stage "self-incurred
minority."]{.underline} He tries to contrast it with having the
"determination and courage to use one's intelligence without being
guided by another." "Have the courage to use your own intelligence."
[But what would it mean if teaching or rather what we might call "the
beyond of teaching" is precisely what one is asked to get beyond, to
stop taking sustenance? **And what of those minorities who refuse, the
tribe of moles who will not come back from beyond (that which is beyond
"the beyond of teaching"), as if they will not be subjects, as if they
want to think as objects, as minority? Certainly, the perfect subjects
of communication, those successfully beyond teaching, will see them as
waste.** But their collective labor will always call into question who
truly is taking the orders of the enlightenment.]{.underline} The waste
lives for those moments beyond teaching when you give away the
unexpected beautiful phrase -- unexpected, no one has asked, beautiful,
it will never come back. Is being the biopower of the enlightenment
truly better than this? Perhaps the biopower of the enlightenment knows
this, or perhaps it is just reacting to the objecthood of this labor as
it must. [**But even as it depends on these moles, these refugees, it
will call them uncollegial, impractical, naive, unprofessional.** And
one may be given one last chance to be pragmatic -- why steal when one
can have it all, they will ask]{.underline}. **[But if one hides from
this interpellation, neither agrees nor disagrees but goes with hands
full into the underground of the university, into the Undercommons --
this will be regarded as theft, as a criminal act.]{.underline}** **[And
it is at the same time, the only possible act]{.underline}**. In that
undercommons of the university one can see that it is not a matter of
teaching versus research or even the beyond of teaching versus the
individualisation of research. **[To enter this space is to inhabit the
ruptural and enraptured disclosure of the commons that fugitive
enlightenment enacts, the criminal, matricidal, queer, in the cistern,
on the stroll of the stolen life, the life stolen by enlightenment and
stolen back, where the commons give refuge, where the refuge gives
commons. What the beyond of teaching is really about is not fnishing
oneself, not passing, not completing;]{.underline}** [it's about
allowing subjectivity to be unlawfully overcome by others, a radical
passion and passivity such that one becomes unft for subjection, because
one does not possess the kind of agency that can hold the regulatory
forces of subjecthood, and one cannot initiate the auto-interpellative
torque that biopower subjection requires and rewards.]{.underline} **[It
is not so much the teaching as it is the prophecy in the organization of
the act of teaching]{.underline}**. [The prophecy that predicts its own
organization and has therefore passed, as commons, and the prophecy that
exceeds its own organization and therefore as yet can only be
organized.]{.underline} Against the prophetic organization of the
undercommons is arrayed its own deadening labor for the university, and
beyond that, the negligence of professionalization, and the
professionalization of the critical academic. [The undercommons is
therefore always an unsafe neighborhood]{.underline}. As Fredric Jameson
reminds us, the university depends upon **["Enlightenment-type critiques
and demystifcation ofs belief and committed ideology, in order to clear
the ground for unobstructed planning and 'development.'" Tis is the
weakness of the university, the lapse in its homeland security. It needs
labor power for this "enlightenmenttype critique," but, somehow, labor
always escapes.]{.underline}** Te premature subjects of the undercommons
took the call seriously, or had to be serious about the call. Tey were
not clear about planning, too mystical, too full of belief. And yet this
labor force cannot reproduce itself, it must be reproduced. **[Te
university works for the day when it will be able to rid itself, like
capital in general, of the trouble of labor]{.underline}**. [It will
then be able to reproduce a labor force that understands itself as not
only unnecessary but dangerous to the development of
capitalism.]{.underline} **[Much pedagogy and scholarship is already
dedicated in this direction. Students must come to see themselves as the
problem, which, counter to the complaints of restorationist critics of
the university, is precisely what it means to be a customer, to take on
the burden of realisation and always necessarily be inadequate to
it.]{.underline}** **[Later, these students will be able to see
themselves properly as obstacles to society, or perhaps, with lifelong
learning, students will return having successfully diagnosed themselves
as the problem.]{.underline}** Still, the dream of an undiferentiated
labor that knows itself as superfuous is interrupted precisely by the
labor of clearing away the burning roadblocks of ideology. While it is
better that this police function be in the hands of the few, it still
raises labor as diference, labor as the development of other labor, and
therefore labor as a source of wealth. [And although the
enlightenment-type critique, as we suggest below, informs on, kisses the
cheek of, any autonomous development as a result of this diference in
labor, there is a break in the wall here, a shallow place in the river,
a place to land under the rocks. **Te university still needs this
clandestine labor to prepare this undiferentiated labor force, whose
increasing specialisation and managerialist tendencies, again contra the
restorationists, represent precisely the successful integration of the
division of labor with the universe of exchange that commands
restorationist loyalty.**]{.underline} **[Introducing this labor upon
labor, and providing the space for its development, creates
risks]{.underline}**. [Like the colonial police force recruited
unwittingly from guerrilla neighborhoods, university labor may harbor
refugees, fugitives, renegades, and castaways]{.underline}. But there
are good reasons for the university to be confdent that such elements
will be exposed or forced underground. Precautions have been taken, book
lists have been drawn up, teaching observations conducted, invitations
to contribute made. **[Yet against these precautions stands the
immanence of transcendence, the necessary deregulation and the
possibilities of criminality and fugitivity that labor upon labor
requires. Maroon communities of composition teachers, mentorless
graduate students, adjunct Marxist historians, out or queer management
professors, state college ethnic studies departments, closed-down flm
programs, visaexpired Yemeni student newspaper editors, historically
black college sociologists, and feminist engineers. And what will the
university say of them? It will say they are unprofessional. Tis is not
an arbitrary charge. It is the charge against the more than
professional. How do those who exceed the profession, who exceed and by
exceeding escape, how do those maroons problematize themselves,
problematize the university, force the university to consider them a
problem, a danger? Te undercommons is not, in short, the kind of
fanciful communities of whimsy invoked by Bill Readings at the end of
his book. The undercommons, its maroons, are always at war, always in
hiding.]{.underline}**

### ORIENTALISM -- THESIS

#### Orientalism was and is created based on pictures, perceptions, and perspectives derived from a European, hegemonic discourse. This discourse objectifies and subjectifies from its own position of power with an intent of imperialism. 

**Burney 12 (Shela Burney, "Orientalism: The Making of the Other",
Counterpoints, Vol. 417, PEDAGOGY of the Other: Edward Said,
Postcolonial Theory, and Strategies for Critique (2012), pp. 26 --
28)///annierhee**

[Orientalism, then, is a complex web of Western representations of the
Orient.]{.underline} Said reiterates his main argument that the
**["Orient was created -- or, rather as I called it Orientalized." (O,
p. 5) by a hegemonic process that robbed it of its true identity, voice,
and Indigenous culture. This imagined reality was substituted with
pictures, perceptions, and perspectives derived from what I like to call
the 'Western gaze' or a hegemonic Eurocentric
perspective.]{.underline}** **[This Western gaze, not unlike the deadly
"male gaze" in feminist theory, subjectifies and objectifies all that it
sees in its own image, through its own colored lenses, and from its own
position of power]{.underline}**. As Said says, "The main thing for a
European visitor was a European representation of the Orient" (O, p. 1)
**[Indeed, Orientalism views the Orient through its own vested
interests, from its own vantage point, with an imperial Eurocentric
perspective.]{.underline}** In a sharp and penetrating critique of the
systemic and systematic objectification of the Orient by the Occident,
Said states: [Under the general heading of knowledge of the Orient, and
within the umbrella of Western hegemony over the Orient during the
period from the end of the eighteenth century, there emerged a complex
Orient suitable for study in the academy, for display in the museum, for
reconstruction in the colonial office, for theoretical illustration in
anthropological, biological, linguistic, racial, and historical theses
about mankind \[sic\] and the universe, for instances of economic and
sociological theories of development, revolution, cultural personality,
national, or religious character.]{.underline} (O, pp. 7-8) These are
the various means and ways of the making of the Other -- of
Orientalizing the Orient. These forms of objectification address every
aspect of its character, from governance to development from academic
study to culture, religion, and identity formation. 'Imaginative
Geography' Orientalism, as a practice, represents an "imaginative
geography" (O, p. 49) of the Orient, written by Western scholars,
writers, anthropologists, ethnographers, travelers and traders,
missionaries, explorers, adventurers. etc. But it is more than mere
narrative and exotic storytelling. Here Said invokes Foucault's notion
of discourse to explain the expansive domain of Orientalism. Foucault
has theorized discourse as a system of statements within which the world
can be known. It is the system by which dominant groups in society
constitute the "regime of truth" by imposing specific knowledge,
disciplines, and values upon dominant groups. **[The practice of
Orientalism -- the hegemonic and stereotypical representation of the
Orient by expert Orientalists -- functions like a discourse that is
sedimented and entrenched in written and oral texts. Foucault's theories
of discourse and his view that representations and discursive formations
are influenced by systems of power is a central argument in
Orientalism]{.underline}**. Said had engaged with Foucault's work in
depth between 1972 and 1986, but over the years, he had become skeptical
of Foucault's notion of power, as it did not lead to action, unlike
Gramsci who believed in the application of theory into actions.
Foucault's writings reject any possibility of direct transition from is
methodological analysis to action. Moreover, Foucault's ideas often seem
to deny the possibility of resistance, which Said develops towards the
end of Orientalism and, later, more deeply in Culture and Imperialism
(1993). Some early critics found fault with Said for basing his
arguments on both Foucault and Gramsci -- postructuralism and Western
Marxism -- but others contended that Said used both theorists in
ingenious ways to create a powerful theoretical concept. This is Said's
genius -- he thinks beyond binaries, borders, and disciplines, deploying
"commonsense" theory, or theory that can be applied rather than just
theorized. Whatever methodological inconsistencies Said may have been
blamed for after the immediate publication of the work have now given
way to the appreciation of his broad vision, monumental critique, and
engagement with controversial, crucial, political and cultural
questions. Said's argument is that "Orientalism depends for its
strategy" on the "positional superiority" \[my emphasis\] of the
Westerner, which has "very close ties to the enabling socio-economic and
political institutions" (O, p. 7) Commenting on Gramsci's concept of
hegemony, he says that European identity ("us) is deemed to be superior
to all "those" non-European peoples and cultures, "reiterating European
superiority over Oriental backwardness" (O, p. 7). Deploying a
discursive style full of euridies references to French, English, Arab,
Indian and other writers, scholars, anthropologists, and historians[,
Said builds his argument about the workings of Orientalism in discourse
by revealing the tropes used by Orientalists or experts on the Orient,
in academic and political fields. Saids presents his thesis through a
vast canvas of sustained discussion and deliberation, choosing examples
from literary works, the arts, geography, politics, history and culture.
There has never been as sustained and as persuasive a case against
Orientalism as Said's thesis. **Using a wide range of textual
scholarship and knowledge of the discipline, Said reiterates that
Orientalism is built by continuous self-referentiality to the past works
of Western authors, rather than containing any references to actual
lived reality.**]{.underline} It is therefore a dubious and circular
discourse that builds its foundation on words, images, textuality and
pre-conceptions that have already been prevalent and popular. Thus, the
Orient is an imaginary phenomenon constituted by generations of writers,
intellectuals, artists, commentators and politicians, and is constructed
by naturalizing a wide range of assumptions and stereotpyes. As Said
explains: The choice of Oriental was canonical; it had been employed by
Chaucer and Mandeville by Shakespeare, Dryden, Pope and Byron. It
designated Asia or the East, geographically morally, culturally. One
could speak in European of an Oriental personality, an Oriental
atmosphere, an Oriental tale, Oriental despotism or an Oriental mode of
production, and be understood. (O, p. 31)

**[A theory that has made a valuable contribution to the scholarly
debate of the security implications of a rising China is constructivism.
A relatively new approach to the study of international relations,
constructivism is fast emerging as a main- stream International
Relations (IR) theory. Unlike realism and liberalism, it places a strong
emphasis on the ideational rather than the material aspects of
international politics.]{.underline}** In the constructivist view there
is no objective knowledge and reality. Our understanding and perception
of the world is historically and socially constructed. **[International
relations should not be explained purely in terms of balance of power
among state actors in an anarchic system. Instead, they are shaped by a
cognitive process of socialization through which states acquire and
define their identities and interests.]{.underline}** **[As such, state
behaviour can be constrained and indeed influenced by intersubjectively
shared ideas and values, as well as institutions and norms. If 'anarchy
is what states make of it' (]{.underline}**Wendt 1992), **[it is
possible to change institu- tions such as self-help and power politics
via international interaction and social practice that aims to reduce
conflict and promote global peace and security]{.underline}** (Onuf
1989; Wendt 1999).

[Constructivists]{.underline} agree that the rise of China's power does
present a considerable challenge to the world and to the Asia-Pacific
region in particular. But they [argue that the concern of a 'China
threat' is not so much a result of the PRC's growing military
capabilities, but the perceived Chinese behaviour that is interpreted as
a threat to regional security or to the interests of other
states.]{.underline} This point is made by Muthiah Alagappa (1998:
665--67) in his discussion of Japan's response to the rise of China.
Alagappa asserts that [Japan's perception of China illustrates the limit
of the neorealist argument that state behaviour is determined by
structural factors. If the realist assumption was to be correct, he
observes, Tokyo would have taken measures to balance against China and
seek to compete with Beijing globally. However, Japanese leaders have
chosen to bandwagon with the United States while trying to engage China
through dialogue and interaction via multilateral institutions in the
region]{.underline}. What this shows is that **[ideational factors such
as history, identity, actor interests and intersubjective understandings
among states are just as important as, if not more than, material
capabilities in shaping responses to the China challenge]{.underline}**.
Similarly, David Kang (2007: 10) argues that the [rapid growth in
Chinese power 'has in the past three decades evoked little response from
its neighbours' in terms of balancing behaviour. This is because East
Asian responses to the rise of China are shaped by both 'interests' and
'identities', rather than by structural change alone]{.underline}. Kang
(2007: 4) contends that East Asian states saw 'substantially more
opportunity than danger' in China's re-emergence as a major power.
China's rise to a great power status, according to Kang, is also viewed
as a natural phenomenon given China's historical role as the dominant
state in East Asia. Seen from this perspective, [China's desire to
maintain stable relationships with its neighbours is not inconsistent
with its worldview when China occupied a central position in the
region]{.underline} (see also Kang 2003; 2003/04). Kang's argument is,
however, challenged by Amitav Acharya (2003/04) who contends that
[security in East Asia should be built on shared regional norms and
institutions rather than a hierarchical order dominated by China.
Constructivists argue that social reality is determined by both material
and ideational factors, but that reality is a product of 'social
construction' and can change according to changing
circumstances]{.underline} (Alagappa 1998: 665). This is why
**[constructivist scholars tend to stress the positive features of the
'reality' that have sustained stability and prosperity across Asia since
the late 1970s, including strategic pragmatism, commitments to economic
growth and the trend towards democratization]{.underline}** (Berger
2000: 425). They accept that [the emergence of China as a pre-eminent
power is a distinct possibility and may lead to a structural
transformation in Asia with profound repercussions. But this is unlikely
to happen for several decades. It is therefore important for other major
powers in East Asia to create an international security environment
within which existing security challenges can be managed while ensuring
China does not feel threatened. Such a benign and stable environment
will hopefully encourage China to develop in 'a benevolent
direction']{.underline} (Berger 2000: 428). From a constructivist
perspective[, it is possible to socialize China into the liberal norms
through regular participation in international institutions and regimes.
A high level of interaction between the PRC and the outside world may
gradually change China's strategic culture, norms of international
behaviour and conceptions of its national identity]{.underline}. In the
longer term, it is argued, increased participation will probably alter
the ideas, beliefs and perceived interests that underpin Chinese
behaviour (see Friedberg 2005: 34--36). However, constructivists are not
naïve in believing that perceptual transfor- mation will take place
overnight. They recognize the persistence of deep-seated mental
constructs in political leaders and elites which may be resistant to
pressure for change. Increased contact with other people can sometimes
reinforce existing beliefs, identities and behaviour (Wendt 1992: 411).
For example, [the economic and cultural contact between China and Taiwan
has expanded immensely in recent years but politically they are drifting
further apart. The growth of Chinese power will indeed threaten regional
stability if the PRC leaders' resort to the use of force to resolve the
Taiwan issue. But the China-Taiwan tension cannot be fully explained by
the realist and liberal theories. At the heart of the problem,
constructivists argue, is a clash of Chinese nationalism and an emerging
Taiwanese nationalism]{.underline} (Hughes 1997). The nationalistic
sentiment on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is so intense that neither
is willing to compromise on the issue of sovereignty despite the
recognition of the disastrous consequences of a cross-strait conflict
for their increasingly interdependent economies (Alagappa 1998: 661;
Berger 2003: 399--400). [Constructivists do not dismiss the relevance of
material capabilities, but they believe that the debate on strategic
intentions of an ascending China must take into account the ideational
forces shaping regional relations.]{.underline} As Alagappa (1998: 661)
puts it: ['Threat construction is a product of the interplay of
capabilities and intentions \... the perception of intentions is
strongly influenced by ideational factors.' The conflict of contending
identities between the PRC and Taiwan seems to provide the most
convincing evidence for the constructivist argument.]{.underline} To
push the theoretical debate further, Peter Hays Gries (2005a) draws on
the insights of social psychology to consider the 'China threat' debate
with special reference to US-China relations. He argues that group
identification is a normal human behaviour and it does not inevitably
lead to intergroup competition and identity conflict. His research
indicates, however, that emotion does play a significant role in turning
competition to conflict. Gries tries to bring individual agency in the
debate on China's rise which is often dominated by discussion of
structural factors. He concludes that 'the Chinese are neither innately
pacifist nor hardwired for conflict', and that **[the way they 'construe
the events of world politics' is shaped by 'history and
culture']{.underline}** (Gries 2005a: 257).

#### The "China Threat" discourse of the aff puts China policy into zero-sum and binary frameworks.

Western Representations of China's Rise // AH

In isolation, each of these moves may not mean much, but the fact that
they happened all at once must be more than pure coincidence. Why these
coordinated moves then? Many argue that they are logical 'responses' to
recent Chinese assertiveness, but this China factor alone does not
provide the whole answer. 53 [In any case, the 'China factor' does not
exist independently of the fore-meanings provided by the 'China threat'
lens. In this sense, the discourse of 'China threat' again has played a
role in the contemporary US policy on China. While most social
discourses carry certain policy implications, 54 **what is special about
the 'China threat' discourse is that its binary frameworks and
unequivocal moral codes almost dictate the making of China
policy.**]{.underline} For instance, [by framing US-China relations
through the dichotomised lenses of security vs. threat, win vs. lose,
survival vs. surrender, containment vs. appeasement, 'act now' vs.
'accept defeat forever']{.underline}, and so forth[, this paradigm makes
it not only obvious but imperative for policymakers to choose one set of
options over the other.]{.underline} [Confronting the China threat thus
becomes not only a matter of military or economic security, but also a
litmus test of Western/US credibility, ontological security and
identity. For Ross Munro, should America fail to stand up to the China
threat, it would be seen as no longer committed to security and
stability in Asia.]{.underline} As a result, **[its credibility among
Asian countries would suffe]{.underline}**r, which in turn could lead to
a domino effect: **['Led by Japan, our friends would scurry to make
concessions to China, possibly including closing their ports and
airfields to U.S. armed forces.]{.underline}** Our days as a true Asian
power would be numbered'.55 A similar scenario was conjured up in
China's Strategic Modernization, a draft report authored by the Defense
Secretary's ISAB Task Force in October 2008. **[This report fears that
China's growing clout could make America's allies in Asia, such as Japan
and South Korea, become increasingly doubtful of US military commitment
and resolve]{.underline}**.56 In this context, any conciliatory gesture
towards China would amount to 'appeasement', showing 'signs of
weakness', or even emboldening other dictators around the world. Given
the negative connotations of such epithets, taking a hardline stance on
China becomes the only viable option. **[Bill Clinton's about-face over
Lee Teng-hui's US visa controversy in 1995 perfectly exemplifies the
constitutive power of the 'China threat' paradigm. Initially the Clinton
administration had reassured Beijing that Lee, given his official status
as the president of Taiwan, would not be granted a visa to visit his
alma mater Cornell University.]{.underline}** [However, looked through
the 'China threat' paradigm, the whole issue soon came to be framed
through the stark binaries of friend/foe and
democracy/dictatorship.]{.underline} Consequently, not issuing Lee a
visa was roundly condemned as a betrayal to a democratic friend as well
as a kowtow to Beijing's authoritarian regime. Conveying precisely this
clear-cut message to Clinton, Chuck Robb, a US senator and close friend
of the President, went a step further by arguing that a kowtow to
Beijing on this issue would 'permit China to determine the visa policy
of the United States'. This line of argument immediately worked. In
Robb's words, 'within minutes' of their meeting, Clinton agreed to
reverse his decision and to grant the visa. During the 2005 Unocal bid
controversy, Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher passionately
described the Chinese bid as evidence of China's belligerence to
'everything we stand for as a people'. 59 With the American national
identity believed to be at stake, Congress almost unanimously passed a
resolution condemning that bid. These examples show that the particular
discursive effect of the 'China threat' paradigm not only prescribes
containment, it mandates it. It is indicative of the 'tyranny of words'
whereby people are 'at the mercy of labels, of expressions used as
weapons'. 60 THE CHINA THREAT AS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT: A CASE OF MUTUAL
RESPONSIVENESS [Despite the powerful effect of the 'China threat'
paradigm on policy-making, we must acknowledge that the 'threat'
representation is not the only contributing factor. To the extent that
international relations are interactively constructed, the hardline
China policy in the US is in part constituted by China's strategic
behaviour]{.underline}. For example, the concept of 'AirSea Battle'
(developed by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments and now seriously entertained by the Pentagon as a part of a
broader strategy of dealing with China) might be seen as a necessary
response to Beijing's growing A2/AD capabilities, rather than a pure
brainchild of the 'China threat' discourse. Yet, **[equally, even as we
turn attention to Chinese capabilities and behaviour in global politics,
we must not lose sight of the constitutive role of the 'China threat'
paradigm in the development of Chinese worldviews and strategic
behaviour in the first instance.]{.underline}** For example, the growth
of China's A2/AD capabilities cannot possibly take place in an
international vacuum; rather, **[they can themselves be seen as
responses to still earlier Western policies on China, policies which are
inevitably shaped by the 'China threat' perception.]{.underline}** In
this section, [I will examine how some key indicators of the China
threat, such as jingoistic Chinese nationalism, realpolitik thinking,
and assertive foreign policy, can be understood not as inherent Chinese
traits, but as **social constructs courtesy of the 'China threat' theory
as practice.**]{.underline} 61 Sure, 'the degree to which China's
domestic and foreign policy adjustments were influenced by US policy
toward China' is very hard to empirically determine or quantifyThat
said, it is still possible to establish their link in a qualitative
manner. The link is no doubt mutual, and how China has influenced US
policy has been well documented.63 . It is now time to examine the other
side of the 'mutual responsiveness' coin, namely, how Chinese thinking
and behaviour are constituted by Western theory and practice.

### TURN -- Realism

#### Realism causes war

**Rigger, 11** (Shelley Rigger, Brown Professor of East Asian Politics
at Davidson College, "Why giving up Taiwan will not help us with china",
<http://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/>,
Date accessed: July 19 2019) // radronning

In the March 2011 issue of Foreign Affairs, [Charles Glaser]{.underline}
makes similar arguments in analyzing Sino-American relations from the
perspective of international relations theory.\[3\] **[He rejects the
Realist prediction that a rising China inevitably will clash with the
United States, the reigning global power. Glaser explains that China's
rise need not threaten US interests because "there is actually little
reason to believe that \[Beijing\] has or will develop grand territorial
ambitions in its region or beyond." Therefore, Washington's priority
should be avoiding unnecessary conflict, not countering or containing
China's growing power.]{.underline}** The best opportunity to reassure
Beijing that the United States is not countering or containing it, he
argues, is to yield to Beijing's preferences regarding Taiwan. Glaser
adds, ["The challenge for the United States will come in making
adjustments to its policies in situations in which less-than-vital
interests (such as Taiwan) might cause problems and in making sure it
does not exaggerate the risks posed by China's growing power and
military capabilities."]{.underline}

#### Structural realism is ineffective to explain IR

**Goldstein, 03** (Avery Goldstein, professor of Global Politics and
International Relations @ upenn, "Structural Realism and China's Foreign
Policy: Much (But Never All) of the Story,"

Can structural realism provide a satisfactory explanation for China's
foreign policy? China scholars have often criticized the work of social
scientists, especially those relying on abstract theories, for ignoring
the special features of the Chinese case.1 Since **[structural realism
intentionally sets aside the distinctiveness of particular
cases]{.underline}**, it would certainly seem to be an obvious target
for this sort of argument. Such criticism, however, is both accurate and
beside the point. The issue is not whether **[structural
realism]{.underline}** can or **[cannot provide an adequate explanation
for China's foreign policy]{.underline}**. It cannot, **[as even
neorealism's founding theorist would readily concede]{.underline}**.
Rather, the important question is how much of the explanation can the
international-structural causes it highlights provide? With this
question in mind, the following chapter reconsiders China's foreign
policy during and after the Cold War. In Man, the State, and War and
Theory of International Politics, Kenneth Waltz explained recurrent
patterns of international behavior and outcomes by highlighting the
causal significance of the system's structure---the constraints of
anarchy emphasized in the former work, and constraints of polarity
emphasized in the latter. Yet, he also indicated that **[however
powerful these structural constraints may be, the explanation of a
particular international outcome (e.g., the outbreak of a specific war)
and the explanation a particular state's behavior]{.underline}**
**[(e.g., its foreign policy) will be incomplete and often misleading if
the analyst ignores causes intentionally set aside for the purposes of
crafting a parsimonious systems theory.]{.underline}**2 [That including
a host of such causes---the personality of state leaders, parochial
political interests of government bureaucrats, ideology, and domestic
social, economic, and political structures---helps provide a fuller
account of the foreign policy choices particular states make, is not
proof of neorealism's fatal flaw, but rather another demonstration of
some simple methodological points.]{.underline} A theory is an attempt
to depict an aspect of the real world through abstraction and
simplification; in making sense of its chosen domain of inquiry, every
theory has a limited range of application; a theory with a wider range
of application is more useful or powerful, but even a powerful theory
provides only a partial account of reality.3 The example frequently
cited to make the last point, makes it well. Newtonian mechanics is a
powerful body of theory (whose limits modern physicists eventually
exposed). Nevertheless, although its attraction provide a compelling
explanation as to why leaves fall to the ground rather than ascend to
the heavens, they are of little use in understanding the different paths
followed by leaves as opposed to apples.4 To explain such differences,
of course, requires drawing on other theories that focus on aspects of
the physical world that were set aside by Newton. The usefulness of
aerodynamics for explaining the path of falling bodies complements
rather than contradicts Newton's insights about gravitational
attraction. Engineers, engaged in applied as opposed to theoretical
science, draw on and combine the insights that abstract and simplified
disciplinary research provides. One should expect it to be likewise with
the study of China's foreign policy. In analyzing a specific empirical
case, one is engaged in applied science, not theoretical science. Thus,
to restate the point made earlier, the question is not whether
neorealism can explain China's foreign policy, but rather how much of
the explanation can the international-structural causes it highlights
provide?

#### Realism is incapable of understanding the depth and intricacies in global environmental and war impacts.

**Ahemed 10**,xx-xx-2010, "The international relations of crisis and the
crisis of international relations: from the securitisation of scarcity
to the militarisation of society", Routlege//aadi

In one salient example, [O'Keefe draws extensively on both offensive and
defensive variants of neorealist theory, including the work of Jack
Snyder, Robert Jervis and Kenneth Waltz, to argue for realism's
continuing relevance in understanding how the 'biophysical environment
plays a significant role in triggering and prolonging the structural
conditions that result in conflict']{.underline}. She notes that
[standard realist concepts such as 'anarchy, security dilemmas, and the
prisoner's dilemma' can be used to explain the emergence of
environmental or resource-based violent conflicts largely within, and
occasionally between, the weaker states of the South]{.underline}.
'Environmental anarchy' occurs in weak states which lack 'active
government regulation' of the [internal distribution of natural
resources, leading to a 'tragedy of the commons'. This generates
resource scarcities which lead to 'security dilemmas' over ownership of
resources, often settled by resort to violence, perpetuated by 'the
prisoner's dilemma']{.underline}. 56 Ultimately, this [theoretical
hypothesis on the causes of environmental or resource-related conflict
is incapable of engaging with the deeper intersecting global structural
conditions generating resource scarcities, independently of insufficient
government management of the internal distribution of resources in weak
states]{.underline}. It simplistically applies the Hobbesian assumption
that without a centralised 'Leviathan' state structure, the persistence
of anarchy in itself generates conflict over resources. [Under the guise
of restoring the significance of the biophysical environment to orthodox
IR, this approach in effect actually occludes the environment as a
meaningful causal factor, reducing it to a mere epiphenomenon of the
dynamics of anarchy in the context of state failure. As a consequence,
this approach is theoretically impotent in grasping the systemic
acceleration of global ecological, energy and economic crises as a
direct consequence of the way in which the inter-state system itself
exploits the biophysical environment.]{.underline} The same criticism in
fact applies to opposing theories that resource abundance is a major
cause of violent conflict. Bannon and Collier, for instance, argue that
resource abundance and greed, rather than resource scarcity and
political grievances, generated intra-state conflicts financed by the
export of commodities in regions like Angola and Sierra Leone (diamonds)
or West Africa (tropical timber). In other regions, abundance rather
than shortages of oil, drugs and gold fuelled and financed violent
secessionist movements in the context of widespread corruption and poor
governance.57 Ultimately, this departs little from the theoretical
assumptions bove, with weak central state governance still blamed for
generating anarchic conditions conducive to conflict over abundant
resources. Furthermore, as Kaldor shows, this s[implistic perspective
overlooks the wider context of the global political economy -- the
evolution of regional 'war economies' was often enabled precisely by the
devastating impact of neoliberal structural adjustment programmes, which
eroded state structures and generated social crises that radicalised
identity politics.58 Under traditional neorealist logic, a strategic
response to global environmental crises must involve the expansion of
state-military capabilities in order to strengthen the centralised
governance structures whose task is to regulate the international
distribution of natural resources, as well as to ensure that a
particular state's own resource requirements are protected. Neorealism
understands inter-state competition, rivalry and warfare as inevitable
functions of states' uncertainty about their own survival, arising from
the anarchic structure of the international system.]{.underline} Gains
for one state are losses for another, and each state's attempt to
maximise its power relative to all other states is simply a reflection
of its rational pursuit of its own security. [The upshot is the
normalisation of political violence in the international system,
including practices such as over-exploitation of energy and the
environment, as a 'rational' strategy -- even though this ultimately
amplifies global systemic insecurity. Inability to cooperate
internationally and for mutual benefit is viewed as an inevitable
outcome of the simple, axiomatic existence of multiple states. The
problem is that neorealism cannot explain in the first place the complex
interdependence and escalation of global crises. Unable to situate these
crises in the context of an international system that is not simply a
set of states, but a transnational global structure based on a specific
exploitative relationship with the biophysical environment, neorealism
can only theorise global crises as 'new issue areas' appended to already
existing security agendas.59 Yet by the very act of projecting global
crises as security threats, neorealism renders itself powerless to
prevent or mitigate them by theorising their root structural causes. In
effect, despite its emphasis on the reasons why states seek security,
neorealism's approach to issues like climate change actually guarantees
greater insecurity by promoting policies which frame these
'non-traditional' issues purely as amplifiers of quite traditional
threats]{.underline}. As Susanne Peters argues, the neorealist approach
renders the militarisation of foreign and domestic policy a pragmatic
and necessary response to issues such as resource scarcities -- yet, in
doing so, it entails the inevitable escalation of 'resource wars' in the
name of energy security. Practically, this serves not to increase
security for competing state and non-state actors, but to debilitate
international security through the proliferation of violent conflict to
access and control diminishing resources in the context of unpredictable
complex emergencies.60 Neorealism thus negates its own theoretical
utility and normative value. For if 'security' is the fundamental driver
of state foreign policies, then why are states chronically incapable of
effectively ameliorating the global systemic amplifiers of 'insecurity',
despite the obvious rationale to do so in the name of warding off
collective destruction, if not planetary annihilation?61

### Death Drive -- Extension

#### Eurocentric IR discourses are premised on the fantasy of sovereignty and desire for recognition in the international order -- the aff's desire for a fundamentally stable international order invites a death-driven violence that intensifies as the fantasy of absolute sovereignty is approached but rendered unachievable. This is at the root of the China/US conflict over Taiwan.

**Epstein 18** (Epstein, C. (2018). The productive force of the negative
and the desire for recognition: Lessons from Hegel and Lacan. Review of
International Studies, 44(05), 805--828.doi:10.1017/s0260210518000347 pg
826-827)//aadi

We are now in the position to revisit our earlier notion of fantasies of
sovereignty. Or rather, with Lacan, we can now consider how [sovereignty
functions as a fantasy]{.underline}, that is, [as a compensatory
structure by which international actors -- states, but also 'wannabe'
states -- chase after an imaginary 'wholeness' projected onto an
idealised past; and that this chasing after is a key driver of
international politics. Just as Lacan's formula illuminates the subject
pursuing a succession of objets a, so sovereignty reveals a similar,
collective hence political, structure of action underwriting the
international system. Sovereignty affords a 'generative grammar' by
which a state identifies its objets a, those specific undertakings that
will restore it that which it has 'lost']{.underline} and 'requires' (by
the terms of this compensatory script) to recover in order to return to
its former grandeur.124 [Objet a is a placeholder. It may be piece of
territory (Crimea, for Russia), a technology, or a weapon: it is
whatever a particular state has invested to assert an undisputable
sovereignty, one that cannot fail to be recognised by other
states,]{.underline} even if they are reluctant to grant such
recognition. The purchase of apprehending sovereignty in these terms is,
first, that the specific 'object' charged with achieving this purpose
(and that is desired for that reason) is determined by a given state's
history. [Moreover, this past grandeur is always necessarily,
structurally, imaginary; regardless of how actually powerful the state
in question is or has been; even for the most powerful state setting out
to 'Make America Great Again.']{.underline} What it taps into is an
imaginary wholeness, the fantasy of a lost unity that is lodged at the
individual level. [Second, to understand that it is imaginary is to
understand exactly where the promise lands, regardless of the prospects
of its realisation. The promise works when it reactivates, for every
supporter, a deep-seated, nostalgic, and perhaps ultimately unshakeable
aspiration to restoring a foregone imaginary oneness of the self, which
constitutes an important motivation for us doing the things we
do.]{.underline} This affords tools for apprehending the enduring
appeal, not of 'populism' (per a recently popular term), but, I suggest,
of sovereignty itself. [What the series of objets a ultimately hide,
however, is the intractable -- because logical, structural -- dependence
that underwrites Westphalian sovereignty as a structure of mutual
recognition.125 This dependence is not a material vulnerability. The
difference is illustrated by an exemplary objet a of sovereignty,
nuclear weapons.]{.underline} The most destructive weapon in the history
of humanity is designed to mark the state that owns it (or the state
that aspires to owning it, and for the same reasons) as possessing what
we have called an absolute 'sovereign agency'. 126 [The
weapon's]{.underline} (negative indeed) [power is perceived by
nuclear-armed states as affording the foolproof guarantee that their
sovereignty will be respected by other states.127]{.underline} The
weapon is desired because [it is thought to compensate for all other
vulnerabilities]{.underline}; including in cases of states whose
material capabilities are less developed or their sovereignty is less
assured, North Korea being a case in point.128 [The dependence, then, is
symbolic and constitutive; it harks to the intractably social structure
of the Westphalian system]{.underline}. This guarantee is necessarily
fanstamatic, in the simple sense that [it is projected, by the actor,
onto the future129 -- another negative. But this guarantee also taps
into the workings of fantasy in the more theorised sense of a
compensatory structure that both designates what the actor wants, and
compensates for it not actually being able to have it.]{.underline} A
state armed with such agentic, destructive capability does not demand
but rather commands the recognition from other states (rivals or not)
that its sovereignty is incontestable.130 Only this 'wrenching' is also
acknowledged, by policymakers themselves, to mark the failure of other
forms of interaction equally founded on mutual recognition, in
particular, of commerce (which rests upon the partners having recognised
each other as legitimate partners and is precisely what is suspended by
sanctions). This was the diagnosis underwriting the so-called 2015 Iran
nuclear deal, which has sought to shift the basis of the interactions
between Iran and the group of world powers to a commercial, and away
from this security, logic. The latter, then, is a dynamic of
misrecognition. [Nuclear weapons are founded in a logic of
misrecognition that then feeds upon itself.131 They presuppose, and then
continue to uphold, the impossibility of being recognised in one's
sovereignty]{.underline} (since they constitute the ultimate weapon
designed to guard against such prospect: other states will recognise me
as a state whether they like it or not if I have a nuclear weapon).
[They turn a desire to be recognised into a demand, or even a command,
for recognition. They are also, however, an implicit acknowledgement of
the impossibility of this desire that nonetheless continues to power the
costly quest for, or maintenance of, nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

### 2NC A2: Discourse doesn't shape reality

#### You're wrong---specifically in the context of the Orient and Occident, reps do shape reality

**Jazeel 12** (Jazeel, T. (2012). Postcolonialism: Orientalism and the
geographical imagination.Geography, 97, 4-11. Retrieved from

First, however, it is worth emphasizing postcolonial scholarship\'s debt
to the path-breaking work of the literary critic Edward Said,
particularly in his book Orientalism (1978). Said\'s Orientalism clearly
allowed us to see how [the very geographical categories of east and
west, or as he referred to them the \'Orient\' and \'Occident\', were
neither in any sense natural, nor merely there]{.underline}. As Said
(1978) suggested, [they are in fact humanly and imaginatively made by a
litany of ways of talking about, painting, and writing on, the Orient
throughout western history]{.underline} - what he referred to as
Orientalism. Consider, for example, that [when we utter phrases such as
\'throughout western history\', we actively participate in a form of
speech that helps consolidate an over-generalized idea of the west (the
Occident) in our imagination, a west that we all too easily believe to
be objectively different from the east]{.underline}. Objectively,
though, what actually is the west? [Where does it begin and end?
Culturally, what values define it? What economic standards demarcate the
west? Politically, what separates west from east? The difficulty in
answering such questions suggests that \'west\' and \'east\' are nothing
if not a vast series of geographical over-generalizations.]{.underline}
In fact, Said\'s (1978) work has shown us how the vast repertoire of
European and North American representations about the Orient that
emerged with the Age of Exploration conjured into existence not only the
imaginative category of the Orient itself, but also our senses of self
as Occidental. In other words, [Orient and Occident are mutually
constituting geographical categories. Despite this commitment to the
representational production of Orient and Occident, however, Said (1978)
did not deny the material reality of eastern or western places. Rather,
he stressed that what makes them seem eastern (Oriental) or western
(Occidental) to us is the vast repertoire of categorization that is made
to seem like common sense through representation, through the things we
say about the world]{.underline}. In short, through discourse. There are
two things to note from the above discussion. First, that the forms of
colonial dispossession, conquest and discovery through which Europe
variously annexed its territorial colonies, were in fact enabled by
Orientalizing ways of seeing the non-west. In other words, [cultural
representations of the non-west, the Orient, were never far from power.
It was precisely the ability of the west to authoritatively represent
the peoples and places of the east as at one and the same time passive,
exotic, undeveloped, barbaric and alluring, that laid the foundation for
contact, dispossession and colonial rule by imperial
powers.]{.underline} Just as there is a vast tradition of 18thand
19th-century European Orientalist painters (Figure 1), novelists and
mapmakers, it is significant that there is no similar South Asian,
African or Middle Eastern artistic or literary tradition of representing
Europe. [With Orientalism, power flows one way.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's criminalization of the "gangsters" and "dealers " creates the state of exception they criticize. The grouping and combination of people into these categories of "Cartel" incentives them to engage with those people. All those who pose a threat to the normative structure of society get excluded from law and pushes them to revolt and resist against the law. 

**The Invisible Committe'17(**The Invisible Committe "Now" 2017;

"Kettling" does not simply constitute a technique of psychological
warfare which the French order belatedly imported from England.
[Kettling is a dialectical image of current political power. It's the
figure of a despised, reviled power that no longer does anything but
keep the population in its nets. If it's the figure of a power that no
longer promises anything, and has no other activity than locking all the
exits. A power that no one supports anymore in a positive way, that
everyone tries to flee as best they can, and that has no other
perspective than to keep in its confining bosom all that is on the verge
of escaping it.]{.underline} The figure of kettling is dialectical in
that what it is designed to confine, it also brings together. It is a
site where meet-ups take place between those who are trying to desert.
Novel chants, full of irony, are invented there. A shared experience
develops within its enclosure. [The police apparatus is not equipped to
contain the vertical escape that occurs in the form of tags that will
soon embellish every wall, every bus shelter, every business. And that
give evidence that the mind remains free even when the bodies are held
captive.]{.underline} "Victory through chaos," "In ashes, all becomes
possible," "France, its wine, its revolutions," "Homage to the families
of the broken windows," "Kiss kiss bank bank," "I think, therefore I
break": since 1968, the walls had not seen such a freedom of spirit.
"From here, from this country where it's hard for us to breathe an air
that is more and more rarefied, where each day we feel more like
foreigners, there could only come this fatigue that eroded us with
emptiness, with imposture. For lack of anything better, we paid each
other in words, the adventure was literary, the commitment was platonic.
As for tomorrows revolution, a possible revolution, who among us still
believed in it?" This is how Pierre Peuchmaurd, in Plus vivant que
jamais, describes the atmosphere that May 1968 swept away. One of the
most remarkable aspects of the fragmentation that's underway is that it
affects the very thing that was thought to ensure the maintenance of
social unity: the Law. [With the exceptional antiterrorist legislation,
the gutting of the labor laws, the increasing specialization of
jurisdictions and courts of prosecution, the Law no longer exists. Take
criminal law. On the pretext of antiterrorism and fighting "organized
criminality," what has taken shape from year to year is the constitution
of two distinct laws: a law for "citizens" and a "penal law of the
enemy.]{.underline}" It was a German jurist, appreciated by the South
American dictatorships in their time, who theorized it. His name is
Gunther Jacobs. [Concerning the riffraff, the radical opponents, the
"thugs," the "terrorists," the "anarchists," in short: all those who
don't have enough respect for the democratic order in force and pose a
"danger" to "the normative structure of society]{.underline}," Gunther
Jacobs notes that, more and more, [a special treatment is reserved for
them that is in derogation of normal criminal law, to the point of no
longer respecting their constitutional rights. Is it not logical, in a
sense, to treat as enemies those who behave as "enemies of society"?
Aren't they in the business of "excluding themselves from the law"? And
so for them shouldn't one recognize the existence of a "penal law of the
enemy" that consists precisely in the complete absence of any law? For
example]{.underline}, this is what is openly practiced in the
Philippines by its president **[Duterte, who measures the effectiveness
of his government, in its "war against drugs," by the number of corpses
of "dealers" delivered to the morgue, which were "produced" by death
squads or ordinary citizens. At the time of our writing, the count
exceeds 7,000 deaths. That we're still talking about a form of law is
attested by the questions of the associations of jurists who wonder if
in this instance one might be leaving the "rule of law."]{.underline}**
The "penal law of the enemy" is the end of criminal law. So it's not
exactly a trifle. [The trick here is to make people believe that it is
applied to a previously defined criminal population when its rather the
opposite that occurs: a person is declared an "enemy" after the fact,
after being phone-tapped, arrested, locked up, molested, ransomed,
tortured, and finally killed. A bit like when the cops press charges for
"contempt and obstruction" against those they've just beaten up a little
too conspicuously]{.underline}.

#### Weapons are needed for self-defense against policing bodies. Police engage in the beating of citizens. Removing arms only leads to these people becoming vulnerable to police in their communities.

[We live under an occupation, under police occupation]{.underline}.
Undocumented immigrants are rounded up in the middle of the street,
unmarked [police cars patrol the boulevards, metropolitan districts are
pacified with techniques forged in the colonies, the Minister of the
Interior makes declarations of war on "gangs"]{.underline} that remind
us of the Algerian war --- we are reminded of it every day. [These are
reasons enough to no longer let ourselves be beaten down, reasons enough
to organize our self-defense. To the extent that it grows and radiates,
a commune begins to see the operations of power target that which
constitutes it. These counterattacks take the form of seduction, of
recuperation, and as a last resort, brute force. For a commune,
self-defense must be a collective fact, as much practical as
theoretical.]{.underline} [Preventing an arrest, gathering quickly and
in large numbers against eviction attempts and sheltering one of our
own, will not be superfluous reflexes in coming times. We cannot
ceaselessly reconstruct our bases from scratch. **Let's stop denouncing
repression and instead prepare to meet it**.]{.underline} [It's not a
simple affair, for we expect a surge in police work being done by the
population itself]{.underline} --- everything from snitching to
occasional participation in citizens' militias. The police forces blend
in with the crowd. The ubiquitous model of police intervention, even in
riot situations, is now the cop in civilian clothes. [The effectiveness
of the police during the last anti-CPE demonstrations was a result of
plainclothes officers mixing among us]{.underline} and waiting for an
incident before revealing who they are: gas, nightsticks, tazers,
detainment; all in strict coordination with demonstration stewards. The
mere possibility of their presence was enough to create suspicion
amongst the demonstrators --- who's who? --- and to paralyze action. [If
we agree that a demonstration is not merely a way to stand and be
counted but a means of action, we have to equip ourselves better with
resources to unmask plainclothes officers, chase them off, and if need
be snatch back those they're trying to arrest. **The police are not
invincible in the streets**, they simply have the means to organize,
train, and continually test new weapons. Our weapons, on the other hand,
are always rudimentary, cobbled together, and often improvised on the
spot. They certainly don't have a hope of rivaling theirs in
firepower]{.underline}, but can be used to hold them at a distance,
redirect attention, exercise psychological pressure or force passage and
gain ground by surprise. [None of the innovations in urban guerilla
warfare currently deployed in the French police]{.underline} academies
[are sufficient to respond rapidly to a moving multiplicity that can
strike a number of places at once and that tries to always keep the
initiative.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's policy of structural adjustment is just a tool to reassert the biopolitical management of society---crisis is permanently maintained to justify the rule of law

**The Invisible Committee 14** (To our friends, probably not
you)//e-toth

This card is really great in the context of how the police always
terrorize and resist insurrections. Gives the example of how in 2005,
the interior minister in Frace Sarkozy enacted a policy of police
crackdown when two kids died after being electrocuted in a substation
trying to escape the police chasing them. The police fired tear gas
grenades into mosques in response to people stoning police officers and
firebombing patrol cars

"If you want to force a change," Milton Friedman advised his Chicago
Boys, "set off a crisis." Far from fearing crises, capital now tries its
hand at producing them experimentally. The way avalanches are
intentionally triggered in order to control their timing and size. The
way plains are set ablaze so that a menacing fire will extinguish itself
there for lack of fuel. "Where and when" is a question of opportuneness
or tactical necessity. It's public knowledge that shortly after being
appointed, in 2010, the director of the Greek Statistical Authority,
ELSTAT, set about falsifying that country's debt accounts, making them
look worse as a way of justifying the Troika's intervention. [So it's a
fact that the "sovereign debt crisis" was launched by a man still on the
official payroll of the IMF, an institution charged with "helping"
countries get out of debt. Here it was a matter of testing out, in a
European country under real conditions, the neoliberal project of a
complete revamping of a society, to measure the effects of a proper
policy of "structural adjustment."]{.underline} With its medical
connotation, throughout the whole modern period crisis was that natural
thing which arose in an unexpected or cyclical way, calling for a
decision to be made, a decision that would put an end to the general
insecurity of the critical situation. The conclusion would be fortunate
or unfortunate depending on the effectiveness of the applied medication.
[The critical moment was also the moment of critique---the brief
interval in which discussion concerning the symptoms and the medication
was opened. That's no longer the case at present. The remedy is no
longer there to put an end to the crisis. On the contrary, the crisis is
set off with a view to introducing the remedy. They speak now of
"crisis" in regard to what they intend to restructure, just as they
label "terrorists" those they are preparing to strike down.]{.underline}
The "crisis of the banlieues" in France in 2005 thus served to announce
the biggest urban-planning offensive of the last thirty years against
the so-called "banlieues," orchestrated directly by the Ministry of the
Interior. The crisis discourse of the neoliberals is a variety of
doublespeak. Among themselves they prefer to speak of a "double truth."
On one hand[, crisis is the invigorating moment of "creative
destruction," 8 creating opportunities, innovation, and entrepreneurs of
whom only the best, most highly motivated, and most competitive will
survive. "Deep down that is probably the message of capitalism:
'creative destruction'---the scrapping of old technologies and old ways
of doing things for the new is the only way to raise average living
standards \[...\] Capitalism creates a tug-of-war within each of us. We
are alternately the aggressive entrepreneur and the couch potato, who
subliminally prefers the lessened competitive stress of an economy where
all participants have equal incomes]{.underline}," writes Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the American Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006.
On the other hand, [the discourse of crisis intervenes as a political
method for managing populations. The continuous restructuring of
everything---social welfare and organigrams, companies and urban
districts---is the only way to ensure the non-existence of the opposing
party, through a constant disruption of the conditions of existence. The
rhetoric of change is used to dismantle every custom, to break all ties,
to unsettle every certainty, to discourage every solidarity, to maintain
a chronic existential insecurity.]{.underline} It corresponds to a
strategy that can be formulated in these terms: "Use a continuous crisis
to avert any actual crisis." On the everyday level, [this is akin to the
well-known counter-insurgency practice of "destabilizing in order to
stabilize," which, for the authorities, consists in deliberately
producing chaos so as to make order more desirable than revolution. From
micromanagement to the management of whole countries, the population is
kept in a kind of constant trauma]{.underline}. The resulting
stupefaction and dereliction mean that the managers can do more or less
what they want with each and everyone. The mass depression currently
afflicting the Greeks is the deliberate product of the Troika's policy,
and not its collateral effect. If some commentators made fools of
themselves by hastily proclaiming the "death of neoliberalism" with the
explosion of the subprime swindle, it's because they failed to
understand that the ["crisis" was not an economic phenomenon but a
political technique of government. We're not experiencing a crisis of
capitalism but rather the triumph of crisis capitalism. "Crisis" means:
government is growing]{.underline}. Crisis has become the ultima ratio
of the powers that be. [Modernity measured everything in relation to the
past backwardness it claimed to be rescuing us from; now everything is
measured in relation to its impending collapse]{.underline}. When the
salaries of Greek civil servants are reduced by half, it's while
pointing out that one could just as well no longer pay them at all.
Every time the period of pension contribution of French wage earners is
lengthened, the rationale has to do with "saving the retirement system."
[The present crisis, permanent and omnilateral, is no longer the classic
crisis]{.underline}, the decisive moment. On the contrary, [it's an
endless end, a lasting apocalypse, an indefinite suspension, an
effective postponement of the actual collapse, and for that reason a
permanent state of exception. The current crisis no longer promises
anything; on the contrary, it tends to free whoever governs from every
constraint as to the means deployed.]{.underline}

#### Thus we advocate a refusal of the aff in favor of revolutionary illicit armament. The people have access to weapons and it\'s time we use them to resist forms of power. When we disengage from violent insurrection we have already lost, therefore the alt is key to destitute power. 

**Comite Invisible '07 (**Comite Invisible, [nom de plume of an

**SO**

[There is no such thing as a peaceful insurrection. Weapons are
necessary:]{.underline} it's a question of doing everything possible to
make using them unnecessary. An insurrection is more about taking up
arms and maintaining an "armed presence" than it is about armed
struggle. We need to distinguish clearly between being armed and the use
of arms. [Weapons are a constant in revolutionary situations, but their
use is infrequent]{.underline} and rarely decisive at key turning
points: August 10th 1792, March 18th 1871, October 1917. When power is
in the gutter, it's enough to walk over it. Because of the distance that
separates us from them, weapons have taken on a kind of double character
of fascination and disgust that can be overcome only by handling them.
[An authentic pacifism cannot mean refusing weapons, but only refusing
to use them]{.underline}. Pacifism without being able to fire a shot is
nothing but the theoretical formulation of impotence. Such *a priori*
pacifism is a kind of preventive disarmament, a pure police operation.
In reality, the question of [pacifism is serious only for those who have
the ability to open fire]{.underline}. In this case, [pacifism becomes a
sign of power,]{.underline} since it's only in an extreme position of
strength that we are freed from the need to fire. From a strategic point
of view, indirect, asymmetrical action seems the most effective kind,
the one best suited to our time: you don't attack an occupying army
front ally. That said, the prospect of Iraq-style urban guerilla
warfare, dragging on with no possibility of taking the offensive, is
more to be feared than to be desired. The *militarization* of civil war
is the defeat of insurrection. The Reds had their victory in 1921, but
the Russian Revolution was already lost. We must consider [two kinds of
state reaction. One openly hostile, one more sly and democratic. The
first calls for our out and out destruction, the second, a subtle but
implacable hostility, seeks only to recruit us.]{.underline} We can be
defeated both by dictatorship and by being reduced to opposing *only*
dictatorship. [Defeat consists as much in losing the war as in losing
the *choice* of which war to wage.]{.underline} Both are possible, as
was proven by Spain in 1936: the revolutionaries there were defeated
twice --- over, by fascism and by the republic. When things get serious,
the army occupies the terrain. Whether or not it engages in combat is
less certain. That would require that the state be committed to a
bloodbath, which for now is no more than a threat, a bit like the threat
of using nuclear weapons for the last fifty years. Though it has been
wounded for a long while, the beast of the state is still dangerous. A
massive crowd would be needed to challenge the army, invading its ranks
and fraternizing with the soldiers. We need a March 18th 1871. When the
army is in the street, we have an insurrectionary situation. Once the
army engages, the outcome is precipitated. Everyone finds herself forced
to take sides, to choose between anarchy and the fear of anarchy. An
insurrection triumphs as a political force. It is not impossible to
defeat an army politically. [The goal of any insurrection is to become
irreversible. It becomes irreversible when you've defeated both
authority and the need for authority, property and the taste for
appropriation, hegemony and the desire for hegemony.]{.underline} That
is why the insurrectionary process carries within itself the form of its
victory, or that of its defeat. Destruction has never been enough to
make things irreversible. What matters is how it's done. There are ways
of destroying that unfailingly provoke the return of what has been
crushed. Whoever wastes their energy on the corpse of an order can be
sure that this will arouse the desire for vengeance. Thus, wherever the
economy is blocked and the police are neutralized, it is important to
invest as little pathos as possible in overthrowing the authorities.
They must be deposed with the most scrupulous indifference and derision.
In times like these, [the end of centralized revolutions reflects the
decentralization of power.]{.underline} Winter Palaces still exist but
they have been relegated to assaults by tourists rather than
revolutionary hordes. Today it is possible to take over Paris, Rome, or
Buenos Aires without it being a decisive victory. Taking over Rungis
would certainly be more effective than taking over the Elysée Palace.
[Power is no longer concentrated in one point in the world; it is the
world itself, its flows and its avenues,]{.underline} its people and its
norms, its codes and its technologies. Power is the organization of the
metropolis itself. It is the impeccable totality of the world of the
commodity at each of its points. Anyone who defeats it locally sends a
planetary shock wave through its networks. The riots that began in
Clichy-sous-Bois filled more than one American household with joy, while
the insurgents of Oaxaca found accomplices right in the heart of Paris.
For France, the loss of centralized power signifies the end of Paris as
the center of revolutionary activity. Every new movement since the
strikes of 1995 has confirmed this. It's no longer in Paris that the
most daring and consistent actions are carried out. To put it bluntly,
[Paris now stands out only as a target for raids, as a pure terrain to
be pillaged and ravaged.]{.underline} Brief and brutal incursions from
the outside strike at the metropolitan flows at their point of maximum
density. [Rage streaks across this desert of fake abundance, then
vanishes. A day will come when this capital and its horrible concretion
of power will lie in majestic ruins, but it will be at the end of a
process that will be far more advanced everywhere else.]{.underline}

### NET BENEFIT -- Black Markets

#### Black Markets are vital to stabilize the economy and provide ways of living for struggling communities.

"History," Greco Jr. goes on, "is full of examples of successful local
initiatives aimed at providing exchange media, but the Great Depression
of the 1930's saw this done on an unprecedented scale. There were
literally hundreds of scrip issues that were put into circulation by a
variety of agencies, including state governments, municipalities, school
districts, clearing house associations, manufacturers, merchants,
chambers of commerce, business associations, local relief committees,
cooperatives, and even individuals. These issues went by different
names, depending on who issued them and the circumstances of their
issuance. Common scrip types were certificates of indebtedness, tax
anticipation notes, payroll warrants, trade scrip, clearing house
certificates, credit vouchers, moratorium certificates, and merchandise
bonds." When most people hear the term ["black market," they immediately
get visions of guys with guns moving heroin across State borders. But
that's only part of the dealings which happen outside of the purview of
the State.]{.underline} [They also think that the government needs to
"do more" in order to crack down on these types of illicit activities.

censorship-resistant alternatives to Uber, Airbnb, eBay and the like are
being built right under our feet. Moreover, today's scrips are the most

situations like this, the existence of independent merchants can mean
the difference between life and death.]{.underline}** Even the value of
Venezuela's currency has started to move away from the government's
control.  At one point, the official exchange rate was

set at 10 bolivars per U.S. dollar, while on the black market it was
trading at 1,000 to one. This action hurt millions by suppressing
[wages](http://blog.independent.org/2017/01/11/more-money-more-problems-venezuelas-minimum-wage-wont-help-inflation/)

For years, the bolivar has experienced

Fiscal Mayhem Greece is going through a transformation of its own ---

people have endured a series of [tax
increases](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/business/international/greek-lawmakers-pass-additional-austerity-measures.html)
and pension cuts over the past several years to fund debts owed to the
European Union. These austerity measures have created a dire situation
for those trying to secure their financial independence. The result has
been widespread tax evasion, which has helped grow Greece's underground
economy to nearly
[25%](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/greece-bailout-black-market.html)
of the country's GDP. Surprisingly, it's not only the poor who are
utilizing the shadow economy in Greece, but also the [professional
class](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-09-14/greece-s-tax-evading-professionals).
Those earning large amounts of money are subjected to extremely high tax
rates, driving many business owners and entrepreneurs to either seek
better opportunities
[abroad](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/25/the-real-greek-tragedy-the-worlds-biggest-brain-drain.html)
or take steps to conceal their income. By persecuting the most
successful members of society and not allowing them to keep what they
earn, authorities are only encouraging disregard for the law. Without
the grey market in Greece, many more skilled workers would have already
left the country. Even though **[the black market]{.underline}** is

Scarcity and the Consolidation of Power Scarcity is more than just a

In 2011, Robert Neuwirth [wrote a
report](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/28/the-shadow-superpower/) for
Foreign Policy that highlighted the importance of this untaxed,

"They say that inventive, self-starting, entrepreneurial merchants who
are doing business on their own, without registering or being regulated
by the bureaucracy and, for the most part, without paying taxes are part
of 'l'economie de la débrouillardise.' (Literally 'Economy of
Resourcefulness') or, for street use, 'Systeme D.' This essentially
translates as the ingenuity economy, the economy of improvisation and
self-reliance, the do-it-yourself, or DIY, economy."The nanny state has
done an excellent job attacking anything outside of the government's
jurisdiction, but a lack of regulation is what allows for the most rapid
growth and productivity. Legislators notoriously
[overestimate](https://fee.org/articles/the-fiasco-of-prohibition/)
their influence on the millions of people they attempt to rule over, but
ultimately, grassroots decisions made by individuals have the greatest
impact. People who rely on their own skills and reputation rather than a
bureaucratic stamp of approval are labeled criminals, but they're the
ones providing real value to society in many cases. Our Black Market
Future Merchants in these off-grid markets are often associated with
danger and violence, but in reality, they provide the purest form of
voluntary transactions. [Negative aspects, like organized crime, are
only made possible because of the profits created as a result of
prohibition. Without the State intimidating the public at gunpoint,
there would be no incentive for people to seek out the services of
nefarious organizations.]{.underline} These organic free markets are
only strengthened with the circulation of assets like cash,

people in ways never imagined. The adoption of cryptocurrencies is
bringing the shadow economy into the digital age and expanding its reach
internationally. **[This new economic system represents a very real

diabetics to navigate black markets and prolong their lives provides
enough motive to liberalize foreign drug access. Managing diabetes is

[The [shadow economy provides

income to people who might not have good options in the legitimate

the]{.underline} [shadow economy employed 1.8 billion

[It allows people to afford medicine, health services, and other
essential products they could never obtain otherwise. For example, a
doctor in a country illegally can provide low-cost health care on a cash
basis because he doesn\'t pay taxes.]{.underline}

#### The binary between legality/illegality is arbitrary, and is only upheld by social and legal definitions -- forcelosing the possibility for people to engage in illegal tactics as a means of survival.

[It is very difficult, not to say impossible, precisely to define the
scope and delineate the boundaries of the illegal economy. It is also
impossible to give a definition that is not specific to a given
time/space context.]{.underline} There are definitional differences
between national jurisdictions, between supranational and national
definitions (Wohlfeil et al., 2009) and between national and
sub-national levels within a national territory (Erman, 2007). **[What
is legal in some times and spaces is illegal in others and so there is a
shifting boundary between them, with legal and illegal defined
relationally and relatively, always contingent and provisional. The
boundary between legal and illegal is thus socially defined, a matter of
definition within the law]{.underline}** (Bhattacharyya, 2005; Glenny,
2008). **[These differing definitions and conceptions typically reflect
power struggles between social actors, within and between state, civil
society and economy and power struggles between national states, between
central and regional governments, between and within social classes,
between economic and environmental interest groups and so
on]{.underline}**. Of particular importance are the strategies of
companies and fractions of capital to influence national states and
supra-national regulatory bodies in labour market regulation (over
issues such as working hours and conditions and wage rates) and in
setting standards for products as part of the social process of creating
and segmenting markets (Hudson, 2001). **[The outcome of these struggles
is the creation of different definitions of the legal and illegal,
drawing the line between them in ways that favour some interests over
others and forcing some firms and people to behave illegally if they are
to seek to survive]{.underline}**. Other forms of state involvement in
the economy may unintentionally create spaces in which illegal
activities can emerge and flourish. For example, the restructuring of
the tobacco industry in China, focussed around a small number of
large-scale enterprises, resulted in 'a sizeable workforce of skilled
labourers as well as production machinery \[being\] made available to
the illicit tobacco business'. This was further reinforced by the
'formidable difficulties involved in obtaining a tobacco exclusive sale
permit' (Shen et al., 2010, 3). Drawing the line between legal and
illegal economic activities is further complicated because legal
companies and legal regulators (typically state actors) engage in
informal and illegal activities. [The sharp line between legal and
illegal becomes blurred]{.underline}. In extreme cases, the definition
of the line is maintained by criminal organisations that practice
extortion and demand protection fees from legal businesses as a
condition of their being able to remain in business. In this way, the
illegal sanctions the legal. More generally, illegal criminal
organisations can operate as proxy agents of governance, extending a
sort of order into spaces of illegality beyond the reach of the
legitimate state (Glenny, 2008).3 Moreover**[, drawing the line between
illegal and legal activities can have unintended and, for some,
undesirable consequences]{.underline}**. For example, the banning of
trade in e-wastes between 'developed' and 'developing' countries has had
at least two unintended and undesirable consequences. First, **[it has
disrupted the livelihood strategies of people and communities who were
already poor, marginalised and dependent upon waste recycling, further
increasing their economic insecurity]{.underline}**. Second, it has
enhanced the role of criminal networks involved in the illicit trade of
e-waste (Williams et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2010) There is an extensive
literature dealing with the variety of organisational forms that capital
can take in the formal legal economy (Hudson, 2001, 96--216). Given the
close links between legal and illegal activities as these are woven
together into complex economies, the conceptual and theoretical tools of
economic geography can also be focused on the illegal---for example,
various strands of political economy and heterodox economics such as
Marxian political economy and institutional and evolutionary economics
and economic geography (Hudson, 2001) as well as more recent
perspectives such as those of relational economic geography (Bathelt and
Glu¨ckler, 2003) and Global Production Networks (Henderson et al.,
2002).4 **[There is a spectrum of illegal activities ranging from
'organised crime' on a large and increasingly global scale, with
corresponding organisational forms, to smaller, flexible and often
horizontally networked organisations, to small-scale localised and
isolated illegal activities as part of individual and household
'survival strategies'.]{.underline}** While the former may be organised
through markets and closely tied to and functionally linked with legal
circuits of capital, [the latter may more often constitute part of a
responsive 'survival strategy' in spaces that have been marginalised
from or were never part of major circuits of capital.]{.underline}
Exchange activities within them are typically organised through much
more localised and personalised networks. As a result, there are not
only many local organisations with a limited spatial reach (Hobbs, 1998;
Glenny, 2008; Madsen, 2009; Castells, 2010) but also major illegal
organisations that behave in some ways like mainstream transnational
corporations with decentralised and devolved structures and 'profit
centres' and links to other major illegal organisations (Saviano, 2008).

#### Illegal economies are good -- allows for illegal tactics and survival strategies to flourish and are protected by systems of social relations and trust within those participating in the economy

**Hudson 13**, Ray. - Ray Hudson, Department of Geography, Durham
University; "Thinking through the Relationships between Legal and
Illegal Activities and Economies: Spaces, Flows and Pathways."; *Journal
of Economic Geography*, vol. 14, no. 4, 2013, pp. 775--795.;

There is a substantial and well-established body of state theory and
theories of regulation, much of which is centred on the national state
(Boyer, 1990; Jessop, 1990). [This analyses the boundaries, scope and
content of state involvement in the legal economy and in the definition
and regulation of a variety of markets within it and so, by implication,
delimits the sphere of the illegal.]{.underline} As noted above,
however, drawing the line between the legal and illegal varies between
national states and their differing modes of regulation, and also as a
result of definitions within incipient global regulatory bodies. The
governance literature focuses on relations between political actors and
institutions (Held, 1989) and has little to say about the governing of
economic practices in workplaces or between companies, let alone the
interplay of the legal and illegal in the day-to-day dirty business of
the quotidian economy. Ethnographies of workplaces explore such
governance relationships (such as Beynon, 1973), but by and large they
remain detached from the mainstream governance literature. While the
worlds of illegal economies are by definition beyond the formal
regulatory realm of the legal economy, **[illegal economies are
nonetheless governed by distinctive sets of social relations and
regulatory practices which are often tightly and precisely organised.
While much illegal activity, especially more organised economic
activity, is conducted within markets, it is also conducted through more
personalised and localised networks of social relations]{.underline}**.
For example, **[this is typically the case when such activity is
primarily part of a survival strategy to 'get by'. In the absence of
legally enforceable contracts, trust assumes considerable importance in
both markets and other systems of exchange]{.underline}** (Gambetta,
2011, especially 39--53).13 It is important to emphasise that illegal
activities are regulated---typically, [in the absence of the
institutionalised trust provided by state regulation, via a combination
of trust based in the social relations of family, clan or territory and,
in extremis and occasionally brutally, via violence or death as a
sanction should these mechanisms prove inadequate.]{.underline}14 Such
activities are therefore generally highly regulated, although in
different ways to those of mainstream legal regulation. As such, while
they may be in conflict with the regulatory practices of the mainstream,
they may also 'capture' elements of them, individually or
institutionally---for example via the corruption of the police and/or
politicians (Glenny, 2008; Saviano, 2008). More generally, this is
symptomatic of 'blind eyes', of state officials and politicians
deliberatively ignoring the illegal, or providing a cloak to hide it,
becoming complicit in providing a 'protective umbrella' (Shen et al.,
2010) for it or even becoming active participants in it (Upadhyaya,
2008; Kazmin et al., 2013).15 In these varied spaces in which [the
sovereign state chooses to avert its eyes to illegality, the formal
distinction between the legal and illegal becomes problematic, or even
irrelevant.16 State officials and politicians may behave in these ways
for a variety of reasons. First, they do so because of fear for their
personal safety, or the temptations of bribery and personal material
gain. Second, because they see illegal activities as a justifiable route
to local economic development]{.underline} (Kynge, 2006, 2009). As Shen
et al. (2010, 13, emphasis in original) remark with reference to China
'\[s\]ince cigarette counterfeiting, through the use of locally grown
tobacco, is a source of revenue for the provincial government and
provides employment for many individuals, local government seem
reluctant to crack down on counterfeiting businesses, especially when
the unauthorized production relates to international brands\... or
brands that are not produced in the particular province , and therefore
does not cause a conflict of interests with local authorized
manufacturers'. Moreover, as noted above, there are spaces in which IPR
theft to produce and then sell fake branded goods locally is seen as
acceptable. Third, and relatedly, because tolerating illegal activities
is a necessary condition to enter into and retain a position, however
marginal, in global circuits of capital and the supply chains of major
transnationals. As Scott Nova of the Workers Rights' Consortium puts it,
these are not industries 'driven by moral considerations but by the
bottom line' (quoted in Brown et al., 2013). Fourth, they may consider
**[activities that are illegal to be morally justifiable and acceptable
because there seems no alternative in spaces abandoned by, or never
brought into, mainstream circuits of capital, a non-network of
impoverished spaces that constitute the so-called Fourth
World]{.underline}** (Castells, 2010). These include old former coal
districts and deindustrialised industrial regions and cities in the
'North' of the global economy as well as spaces and people that never
made it into or beyond the margins in the 'South'---such as small coca
growers in Colombia (Allen, 2005). **[Illegal activities may be allowed
as part of survival strategies in spaces detached from the mainstream,
precisely because they and people living in them are excluded or have
been expelled from the mainstream]{.underline}** (Bhattacharyya, 2005;
Glenny, 2008). In **[the absence of the legal mainstream, they offer an
alternative mode of survival]{.underline}**. Such spaces 'on the
margins' are more likely to be those in which 'blind eyes' proliferate,
raising theoretical questions as to the relationships between agency,
institutions and structures. It is important to emphasise, however, that
the illegal is often integral to activities in the core spaces of global
capitalism, and also that legal activities (for example, banking and
activities in offshore financial centres) may be seen as immoral
although maybe necessary, as I show in the next section.

#### **In times of economic hardship people often turn to illegal means of acquiring money for their survival such as with the emergence of the kukiya-kiya economy in Zimbabwe which changes the perspectives of people surrounding their need for legality and respectability, rupturing the perspective of what a "straight" and proper life should be.** 

**Jones 10** (Jones, Jeremy L. \"'Nothing is straight in Zimbabwe': The
rise of the kukiya-kiya economy 2000--2008.\" *Journal of Southern
African Studies* 36.2 (2010): 294-297. //mms)

This quality of suspension helps explain why [in earlier periods,
kukiya-kiya was looked down upon: since it was oriented to the here and
now by definition, it stood opposed to morally valorised forms of
planning and directing one\'s life]{.underline}. The latter sought to
spread agency to a wider group of people (the extended family) and a
longer timeline (including the afterlife, however rendered).40 The
question is, What happens in a context where kukiya-kiya comes to be
viewed as not only normal, but necessary? I ask this to emphasise the
historical point: the kukiya-kiya economy is taken to be new. That is
part of what makes it different from similar types of activity elsewhere
and in other periods. We therefore must establish the connection between
a particular form of economic behaviour and a particular attitude
towards history. Here, I suggest, there is a dialectic between
activities based on a suspension of rules - kukiya kiya - and a
historical sense that one is living in a state of suspension, where what
used to take place, or what should take place, is now impossible.
Micro-practice actually shares the same spatio-temporal logic -
suspension - as the prevailing view of macro-history. Indeed, the two
levels of suspension reinforce each other. [At the level of the
imagination, \'need\' - the need to \'survive\' for instance - is given
historical charge: this is the time of need, the time of survival, and
therefore, economic strategies of survival are in order. At the level of
practice, by doing \'whatever is necessary\', people effectively prolong
the situation that demands such behaviour, thus making it almost
inevitable that it will continue.]{.underline} Ultimately, it is the
interaction between the two levels that produces the \'stupor\'
discussed earlier. It also leads to a spiral of circular reasoning,
where \'here and now, in this country,\' it is only possible to do what
can be done \'here and now, in this country\'. The logic sounds
perverse, but its expression is often quite poignant. For instance, in
January, 2007, Mai Chisamba, Zimbabwe\'s most popular TV talk show host,
aired an episode in which she and her audience debated kukiya-kiya.
[Kukiya-kiya is not necessarily bad, she pointed out, because it all
starts with the simple goal of \'trying to make ends
meet\']{.underline}. Nonetheless, there is a question of limits: \'Is
there somewhere where you stop and say, \"no, that\'s enough\"?\'41
Pointing to a young man, she asked, \'isn\'t there a way of doing it
that follows an acceptable route (zvine gwara)T He responded, Ah, Mai
Chisamba, this is a tough issue. [Because here in this country \... the
country is difficult, so \... I just have to \'kiya-kiya\' in order to
live. A person will know that, \"a, what I\'m doing could land me in
jail, or I could end up becoming a prostitute\". But there\'s nothing to
do about it. They want to live. Their family might die of hunger. The
country, that\'s what\'s causing this sort of thing\...]{.underline}
What kind of life is it, Mai Chisamba countered, if you end up in
trouble that could have been avoided (kuzvipinza muna taisireva)! Ah,
Mai Chisamba, someone will think that they are too clever, like, \'let
me do like so, and so, and so\... how will the police ever see me?\'\...
[Really, there\'s no other route to take. It\'s just a matter of
surviving. Because that\'s just what the situation in the country
demands, it now demands that we use force (ya \'kutoda zveginya) to
survive. On one hand everything the young man mentions - prostitution,
furtive plotting, and force (ginya) - is code for immorality in the
Zimbabwean context. On the other, he claims that such activity is
necessary at this point in time. The \'situation in the country\'
demands it. If you and your family want to survive, he declares, then
you must accept known risks and scheme your way to a living. You may
exceed normal moral limits in the process, and you may even get caught,
but there is no other route]{.underline}. This sort of appeal to
necessity - so common nowadays - has two key rhetorical components. The
first is the repeated invocation of the so-called \'situation\' in the
\'country\' \'these days\'. Mai Chisamba\'s guest refers to \'the
country\' four times in this thirty second clip, and like many others,
he ascribes causative force to what he terms the \'situation\' (in
English). The \'country\' is in this view a unitary space bounding
specific economic logics. For the young man, it is the \'country\' and
the current \'situation\' therein that has created the circular relation
between feeling forced and resorting to force in order to survive. Thus,
in everyday conversation, [the breaching of borders (whether through
migration or cross-border trade, or even symbolically, through the
possession of foreign currency), is seen as a key strategy in opening up
new possibilities for livelihood]{.underline}. \'The situation these
days\' (mazuva ano), on the other hand, like the notion of \'crisis\',
gives a name to an otherwise confusing span of time. Mbembe and Roitman
claim that the idea of \'crisis\' in Cameroon has become an organising
metaphor for daily living: a way of explaining the inexplicable and
justifying the unjustifiable.42 Likewise, writing of Guinea Bissau,
Henrik Vigh suggests that \'in chronic crisis \... crisis becomes a
frame of action\' 43 There is a further level of temporal ordering
involved here, though. Like any demonstrative, \'these days\' is
referentially ambiguous: it could point to the last seven days or the
last 50 years. The referent of \'the situation\' is equally opaque. Both
have conventional referents, though. For instance, \'these days\' has
often been used together with \'zvino-zvino\' (now) and \'nhasi (today)
to connote \'modern\' time - as opposed to \'tradition\' of long ago
(kare).44 Its usage thus often evokes a nostalgically rendered past,
from which \'these days\' are a departure. By playing on this
referential possibility, the phrase \'the situation these days\' invites
comparison to an earlier rhetoric of time, and with it, an earlier
discourse on moral economy and historical transformation. This helps
explain the second rhetorical component structuring \'necessity\' in
everyday contexts: the spectre of so-called \'real work\' (basa chairo).
This \'real work\' is in fact the only real antonym of kukiya-kiya. It
often refers to a profession, especially one that requires specialised
education, but the more general suggestion is one of wage labour: JLJ -
[How would you define kukiya-kiya?]{.underline} Young man - [Kukiya-kiya
is just a matter of doing whatever you can in order to make a living
...Like me, my real work (basa rangu chairo) is auto mechanics, but
these days, you know, we just do whatever\...]{.underline} Wage labour
in turn has particular socio-historical valences. First, it is
associated with education and urban life, where it maps onto locally
held notions of \'success\' (budiriro) and \'development\', whether
personal, familial, or national. Second, it is deeply gendered for
most - calling forth the idea of man as \'breadwinner\' for a domestic
sphere composed of women and children. This explains Tapiwa\'s claim
that kukiya-kiya used to be associated with women. Third, it brings with
it a whole range of \'normalising technologies\'.45 For instance, wage
labour implies a particular organisation of space and movement (the
workplace and the home), and a precise organisation of time
(labour/leisure). Furthermore, it opens the door to particular forms of
political community, like the labour union. Finally, the monthly
pay-cheque itself bonds the citizen to the state and the formal economy.
It allows the establishment of credit, and brings one into contact with
a particular regime of state control - income tax, pension funds,
municipal rates and levies of all kinds. Of course, this ideal of wage
labour was rarely fulfilled: as James Ferguson writes of neighbouring
Zambia, industrialisation, urbanisation, and a progressive development
along patriarchal lines were more matters of aspiration than fact.46 But
the moral charge of wage labour continues to haunt new forms of
livelihood as something lost. Mai Chisamba\'s guest is therefore
expressing a feeling of contradiction borne of conflicting values. [One
wants to live \'respectfully\', he suggests, but \'real work\', the
decaying bulwark of that respectful form of life, is no longer
available, nor does it pay]{.underline}. Later in the same episode of
Mai Chisamba, an older man tries to bridge the gap: Mai Chisamba, I want
to help people understand kujingiridza. If you jingiridza, do it
straight, zvakaswatuka \[\'straight\', ChiShona\], then you\'re allowed
to jingiridza. Not when you jingiridza and you go beyond what is
acceptable \[kupfurakidza \]\... The use of \'straight\' here is
crucial: a single word captures the essence of an eclipsed moral
economy[. In Zimbabwe, \'straight\' (and occasionally its ChiShona
equivalent kuswatuka) is used in a variety of situations to convey the
sense of doing things properly via established and socially-accepted
routes]{.underline} (zvine gwara as Mai Chisamba puts it).47 As might be
expected, [the \'law\' is taken to demand and establish paradigms of
straightness. Beyond that, though, one can also speak \'straight\', that
is, sincerely, respectfully, and to the point. Similarly, custom demands
that rituals be done \'straight\', namely openly and according to rules,
if only to avoid later disagreements. In the economic realm,
\'straight\' transactions are those that have legitimate receipts or
other forms of documentation.]{.underline} At the individual level,
\'straight\' may also bring to mind the idea of a routine. As one young
man put it, a man who goes to work at the same time every day, goes to
the bar afterwards, sits in a specific place, then returns home at a
standard hour is doing things \'straight\'. He is in active conformity
with, and thus reproducing a recognised structure of progression. [In
recent years, this will-to-straightness has been
interrupted]{.underline} at two levels, corresponding to the macro and
micro suspensions noted above. First, as a matter of historical
consciousness, \'straightness\' blends well with what Ferguson has
called \'expectations of modernity\':48 [in the public imagination,
Zimbabwe is supposed to move forward in a \'straight\' manner (that is,
lawful, transparent, measured). But while some might argue that events
of the last ten years - land reform primary amongst them - have been
intended to clear a path for just that sort of
development,]{.underline}49 [the experience has been one of stoppage for
much of the population, particularly those in urban areas. Indeed,
people have been forced to revert to what is derisively termed \'hunting
and gathering\'. For them, Zimbabwe is caught in a historical vortex,
devoid of progression]{.underline}. Second, at the level of practical
conduct, [the fact is that the kukiya-kiya economy is far from straight.
On the contrary, it is premised on crookedness and wandering, both real
and metaphorical. This point was graphically illustrated when I played a
recording of the Mai Chisamba segment above to a group of young men.
Amidst peals of indignant laughter, one exclaimed: \'kukiya-kiya
\"straight\"! There\'s nothing like that! Kukiya-kiya is all about
\"zigzag\".\' \'Look\', another added, \'you can kiya kiya \"straight\"
but you won\'t make any money, and that\'s the whole
point.]{.underline}\'

#### **Kukiya-kiya is the Zimbabwean sub economy characterized by frequently illegal or quasi-legal dealings for the purpose of makings ends meet.**

**Jones 10** (Jones, Jeremy L. \"'Nothing is straight in Zimbabwe': The
rise of the kukiya-kiya economy 2000--2008.\" *Journal of Southern
African Studies* 36.2 (2010): 294-297. //mms)

Here we must return to the topic at hand: kukiya-kiya. Is it simply a
set of activities meant as stopgap measures, or something more? First,
the \'official\' definition. [The vernacular Shona dictionary defines
kukiya-kiya as resorting to strenuous or difficult activity with an eye
to fulfilling basic needs]{.underline}.25 It is an activity of last
resort: something a person does just to get by. The verb ending the
definition, kuraramisa, literally means \'make live\' and is often
translated as \'survival\'. \"Kiya\" itself is taken directly from the
English word \'key\', and the unduplicated verb form, kukiya, refers to
locking something, like a door. It is also used metaphorically, though,
to convey the acts of imbibing (particularly alcohol), striking someone
or something, or holding something in a tight grip. Kukiya-kiya seems to
start with these metaphorical usages, adding a suggestion of
intensification: striking hard or repeatedly, cleverly locking out, etc.
The idea is that one \'secures\' a living in a battle with circumstance,
and that survival is a matter of persistence and outright force. The
truth, however, is that [Zimbabweans give contradictory explanations of
kukiya-kiya, and often disagree as to how other social phenomena are
related to it.]{.underline} Consider the following (abbreviated) list of
\'ways to make money\' elicited from a group of 20 to 30 year-old young
men: Kutenga nokutengesa - [the buying and selling of goods, whether
legal or contraband]{.underline}. Kuhodha - from the English for either
\'hoarding\' or Ordering\', depending on who you ask. Both entail [the
bulk accumulation and sale of commodities, whether legally or
illegally]{.underline}. Kuvhara - literally \'to close\', here meaning
[to defraud or refuse to give back what is owed]{.underline}. Kuita
madhiri or kudinha - [doing \'deals\', particularly illegal or
fraudulent deals.]{.underline} Kusofta mhene - \'softening\', that is,
creating client relations, with a patron. This may or may not involve
doing actual work, for example as a security guard, labourer, etc, but
where it does it is normally piecework, paid at irregular intervals and
rates. Kudhumanisa - \'bumping together\', that is, [acting as a
middleman, particularly in a fraudulent manner.]{.underline}
Kukorokoza - literally mining or panning for gold (and, more recently,
diamonds), but often used to mean something similar to \'dig up\'.
Hum-work or ngunzu - [mugging or other forms of violent
robbery]{.underline}. Kuba - [theft in general]{.underline}. Kudhubha -
especially stealthy theft, for example that is associated with
housebreaking. Kuhura - [prostitution (this applies to women only,
according to this group of men).]{.underline} What is striking about
this list, aside from its shocking distillation of economic reality, is
the fact that [the young men claimed that all of these activities were
types of kukiya-kiya.]{.underline} Others would vehemently deny this.
What relation does \'hoarding\' have with prostitution or mugging?
\'Hoarding\' is most often associated with mothers selling vegetables
and doing cross-border trade. Mugging and prostitution, on the other
hand, are associated with scorned figures like the hure \[whore\] and
the tsotsi.26 Kukiya-kiya thus presents a real problem insofar as its
thematic unity is concerned. A case study will help tease out the
connections. Consider Tapiwa, a friend that I have known since the
mid-1990s. Early in 2007, Tapiwa and I bumped into each other at a
market in Chitungwiza. As we were exchanging greetings, he pulled out a
worn ID card, identifying him as an employee of ZINWA, the much despised
Zimbabwe National Water Authority locally referred to as \'Zimbabwe No
Water Available\'. \'How did you land that job?\' I teased him. I
already knew. Although his portfolio of money-making schemes is as wide
as most urban youth, his cultivation of patronage relations with local
ruling party stalwarts has always been central. The ZINWA position, he
admitted, came to him via \'connections\'. \'The job is a joke,
though,\' he complained: \'the money I get doesn\'t even feed me for a
week.\' [He explained how he spent a significant part of every working
day doing \'deals\' to supplement his income]{.underline} or simply
relaxing in bottle stores. \'In other words, you kiya-kiya\\ I said,
probing for his reaction. \'Exactly\', he replied. He then gave me a
history lesson. \'Long ago,\' he said, \"kukiya-kiya was looked down
upon\': If you were a man and you didn\'t have a proper job,27 no one
would take you seriously. This stuff, buying and selling, running around
looking for bread money - that was women\'s work, something they did to
supplement household income. A real man could even prevent his wife from
doing it. But now\... You see those guys \[pointing into the market
stalls\]? They make more money in one day from gambling than I make all
month at work. [If you want to make money now, you have to
kiya-kiya]{.underline}. \'Why stay at work then?\' I asked. He kicked
some pebbles: \'I\'m just making ends meet until things change. Plus,
sometimes you can get some bribes from people to keep their water on\'.
Unsatisfied, I prodded further: \'and when will things change?\' \'Not
soon, man,\' he sighed, \'not soon\'. After buying him a beer - it was
9:30 on a Tuesday morning and he was \'on the clock\' - we parted ways.
Not more than an hour later, though, he was tapping me on the shoulder,
a big grin on his face. \'Ah\', he beamed, [\'this is what you call
kukiya-kiya. The real thing]{.underline}. And imagine, if I hadn\'t sat
down to talk to you, it would have never happened.\' He proceeded to
outline the complex deal he had just completed. [A man had been walking
by the market with a set of plumbing tools]{.underline}. Tapiwa, still
sitting outside the gate watching a card-game, stopped him to ask the
price. [The man said he wanted \$150,000]{.underline} (worth
approximately US\$5 at the time). Based on his own limited plumbing
experience, [Tapiwa realised that this was a ridiculously low price, and
offered to facilitate the deal with another friend for a small fee of
\$50,000]{.underline}. In point of fact, [the price may have been that
low because the tools were stolen.]{.underline} [Tapiwa\'s
\'facilitation\' was a farce, too]{.underline}: although he was
recognised in the market, he did not have a \'friend\' there.
Nonetheless, [he took the tools inside the gate and immediately sold
them to a trader for \$600,000,]{.underline} half of which he would be
given the following day. [He returned to the initial seller and said he
would only charge him \$30,000 \'as a favour\'. He gave him \$120,000,
went away with \$180,000, and had a guaranteed \$300,000 coming to him
the following day]{.underline}. A sizeable profit for doing nothing more
than stretching the truth, I observed. \'No, no\', [he said, \'everybody
is doing it these days. And that guy was happy with \$120,000. You see,
that, my friend, is kukiya-kiya.\']{.underline}

#### Many women need the illegal economy of urban streets to survive and support themselves financially. The illicit nature and legal ramifications of their actions are a non-issue for most in the face of their more pressing concerns. They also develop strategies to keep themselves safe like social networks and taking advantage of the legal system for their own benefit.

**Levine et. al. 01** (Levine, Kay, and Virginia Mellema. \"Strategizing
the street: How law matters in the lives of women in the street-level
drug economy.\" *Law & Social Inquiry* 26.1 (2001): 181-184.//mms)

You call it violence, we call it surviving . . . it's just the way it is
in the city. (Lisa and Sherrie, Detroit gang members, in Taylor 1993,
100) [Like their counterparts in the formal economy, women on the street
must generate income in order to survive. While their food and clothing
needs may be minimal, the costs of maintaining a drug addiction can be
quite high; a daily drug user must have a regular, substantial source of
in- come in order to support her habit]{.underline} (Anglin and Hser
1987, 361). [Because few street women maintain employment in the formal
sector and because fewer still are supported by any other sufficient
source of income (family, spouse, or welfare), they must "strategize the
street" in order to make ends meet. These strategies of income
generation for women on the street are classified as hustles, a term
that denotes three principal categories of work: (1) drug hustles, which
include various roles in the drug sale networks, (2) non- drug hustles,
which include both criminal behavior and unlawful, unregulated "odd
jobs,"s and (3) sex work, which is limited to street
prostitution]{.underline} (Maher 1997, 83; Miller 1986; Pettiway 1997;
Anglin and Hser 1987, 362- 63,393; Hser, Chou, and Anglin 1990, 210).
Engaging in one type of hustle versus another depends on a woman's
individual needs and ability both to perceive and to take advantage of
an opportunity (Hser et al. 1990, 224). "[These are women hustlers using
their bodies as resources and using their minds as assets to ensure
their survival"]{.underline} (Pettiway 1997, xiii). [The fact that all
of these behaviors are strictly and clearly illegal is generally not a
factor in their decisions.]{.underline} Why does illegal status fail to
serve as a deterrent? [For women living in the street economy, survival
is more urgent; defining morality as consis- tent with state regulation
would jeopardize their life chances by circum- scribing their
behavior.]{.underline} The women of the street exist in a complicated
network of informal social controls enforced by violence: As one female
gang members asserts, "Crime was always in my 'hood. . . . Violence is
part of life out here, in our 'hood you see violence all the time and
that's what time it is. . . . \[Tlhe way the street is, either you stay
ready or it's gonna get you" (as quoted in Taylor 1993, 54-57). Bourgois
(1995, 10) argues that in many neighborhoods, the law-abid- ing majority
has "lost control of the public space," thereby allowing drug dealers to
take control of the street comers, playgrounds, and parks and to dictate
standards of behavior to those who frequent them. "[Mainstream society
simply has no concept of how 'normalized' drug selling has become on
inner-city streets]{.underline}" (Bourgois 1995,280). [In a world where
the normal mechanisms of social control are "unnecessary, unacceptable,
and meaningless]{.underline}" (Harris 1988, 166), [the prominence of the
drug dealer is a simple fact of life: "The dope man is the king in our
'hood. . . . The dope man is bigger than anybody in the
'hood"]{.underline} (as quoted in Taylor 1993,55). [The women who live
in these neighborhoods must constantly work to protect themselves from
their surroundings. Law is clearly more of a enemy than a friend in this
environment and not a very formidable enemy at that. Law's threat is
much more attenuated than the threat posed by the streets]{.underline}.
Given the street's perspectives on, and challenges to, survival, it
should come as no surprise that women experienced in street life report
little or no fear of arrest or incarceration (see, e.g., Maher 1997).
[Criminal justice intervention is a legal nuisance, but it is not a
matter of life or death. Getting arrested is simply an occupational
hazard of living and working on the streets.]{.underline} Miller (1986,
126) and Pettiway (1997, 47) report that the women they interviewed have
been arrested so many times that they are unable to keep track or to
remember the specifics of any particular case. Moreover, the women are
largely unconcerned about asserting their constitutional rights;
pleading not guilty and going to trial increases the costs of working
and is thus an undesirable option (Miller 1986, 130; Feeley 1979).
[Incarceration, like plea bargaining, is regarded as part of the cost of
doing business.]{.underline} Many of the women actually speak about
their incarceration periods quite positively. [Rather than viewing jail
time as wasted time, they report that jail gives them the opportunity to
plan future scams, to rest, to get healthy, to get food, to take
advantage of social services, and to have a warm bed]{.underline}
(Pettiway 1997, 47, 134, 177; Miller 1986, 143, 168). One woman
interviewed by Pettiway considers jail "just like home" (1997, 138).
[Additionally, criminal justice system experience enhances a woman's
reputation (and thereby enlarges her opportunities) on the
street]{.underline}. In a world controlled by violence and the credible
threat thereof, [establishing oneself as an experienced criminal works
to increase one's marketability.]{.underline} Pettiway, for example,
reports that [only women with extensive arrest and incarceration records
can successfully join mixed-gender crime groups]{.underline} (1987,
760). These comments regarding arrest and incarceration reveal that,
while the law does not deter street women's participation in illegal
activity, its effects are clearly felt-in unintended yet profound ways.9
[Street women can and do navigate the criminal justice system to best
suit their needs; they will plead guilty early so they can get back to
work, they will get food, rest, and medical attention while in custody,
and they will use their criminal status to enhance their street
reputations]{.underline}. These actions and attitudes signify that many
street women undergo a mental shift toward maximizing the benefits of
one's contact with the law, rather than protesting its impositions or
fighting its control. Consequently, they resist seeing themselves as
pawns of the criminal justice system and emphasize instead the benefits
to be gained from its structures. Interestingly, although arrest and
incarceration are neither uncommon nor unduly disruptive, street women
minimize their risk of getting caught by devising various strategies.
Relationships with others are one key to successful evasion of criminal
justice involvement. Rosenbaum (1981,53) and Pet- tiway (1997, 45-46)
argue that [women who work in social networks reduce their chances of
arrest by undercover officers; the members of the network share
information and watch out for each other. Isolated women are ar- rested
more frequently because they lack sources of information and
protection]{.underline} (Miller 1986). Nonetheless, with the onset of
crack consumption in the street-level drug economy, solidarity among
women has weakened. Crack use has driven down the price for sexual acts
and has flooded the market with prostitutes, all of whom must generate
income to support their drug habits. As a result, the street prostitutes
have become increasingly competitive with each other, making them more
vulnerable to victimization by street men and by police (Maher 1997,
113; Bourgois 1995, 280). Street women also develop multiple and
overlapping relationships with law enforcement, particularly with the
police officers who patrol their neighborhoods. Many of the women
interviewed by ethnographers refer to the police as "just another gang,"
indicating that cops are simply one cate- gory of men with whom, or
around whom, a woman must work in order to survive (Campbell 1984;
Taylor 1993,58, 64). [While police harassment is a frequent complaint in
some neighborhoods]{.underline} (see, e.g., Burris-Kitchen 1997,
112-13), [other women report that police officers distribute or donate
drugs and sometimes warn residents of sting operations planned by task
forces]{.underline} (Pettiway 1997, 93, 95; Boyle and Anglin 1993,
162-63). [Furthermore, various women who support their drug habits with
sex work admit that they occasionally have police officers as
customers]{.underline} (Maher 1997, 102; Taylor 1993, 93; Pettiway 1997,
46, 82).

#### **When governmental forms of support and legal methods of getting money fail, people are forced to turn to illegal method of acquiring money in order to survive.** 

**Ritter 05** (Ritter, Archibald. \"Survival strategies and economic
illegalities in Cuba.\" *Cuba in Transition* 15 (2005): 351-353."//mms)

[The most powerful force promoting economic illegalities of many sorts
is necessity. The general economic policy framework produces a structure
of incentives and overall situation facing Cuban citizens that requires
that they undertake numerous ostensibly illegal economic actions in
order to survive.]{.underline} The central reason for this is t[hat
people earn mooned nacional or "old pesos," but their earnings are
insufficient to purchase the basic foodstuffs --- not to mention
everything else--- that they require for survival.]{.underline} This
means that [people must find additional sources of income in "old pesos"
or convertible pesos (]{.underline}previously U.S. dollars) [to permit
their survival]{.underline}. Cuban citizens often express the situation
by saying that [their official monthly wage or salary will buy basic
foodstuffs from the rationing system and other sources that are
sufficient for only about 10 to 14 days of the month]{.underline}.
Purchases for the rest of the month must made with funds from other
sources. Furthermore, [the products actually available through the
rationing system are exceedingly limited]{.underline}. In the period
1999 to 2004, they included rice, sugar, beans occasionally, cooking oil
occasionally, eggs occasion-ally, meat very occasionally, milk for
children, pasta, bathing and washing soap occasionally, matches, and
tooth paste occasionally. It is difficult to imagine a person attempting
to survive on the products actually available to them. Other goods and
services had to be obtained from the dollar stores, from cuenta
propistas, or from the agricultural markets. (Electricity and water ---
but not telephone service --- were also avail-able for low old peso
prices.) A study by L. Lam for Havana in 2002 estimated that the
foodstuffs available through the rationing system provided adequately
for children age 0 to 6 years in terms of calories and protein, though
not fat. However, [the age group from 14 to 65 years received only 43.1%
of the calories, 32.1% of the protein, and 12.9% of the fats recommended
by Cuba's National Institute for Nutrition and Food.]{.underline}
Similarly, those over 65 years of age received 61.8%, 55.4%, and 17.2%,
respectively, for the three food components (Togores and García, 2004,
p. 260). This means that it is necessary to find other sources of
foodstuffs, from the mercados agropecuarios, the dollar stores, the
state vegetable markets, the black market, or from household production.
The first four of these sources are expensive, so that Cubans are hard
pressed to make up the food deficits from the rationing system. A
rigorous calculation of necessary food expenditures and incomes has been
made by V. Togores and A. García (Ibid., 260--262). Their estimates of
the costs of foodstuffs from the various sources are presented in Table
3. The subsidized state sources provided70% of the caloric requirements,
household production 22%, and market-oriented sources 3%, leaving a
consumption gap of 6%. [They estimated that in or-der to provide the
level of caloric intake recommend-ed by the FAO, the total cost of food
and food alone from the various sources would be 156.00 old pesos per
month]{.underline}. (This excludes protein requirements another
nutritional requirement, and calories are used as a proxy for general
nutritional intake.) In fact, [the average monthly per capita income
in1998 was 116 old pesos. Clearly according to these estimates, state
sector incomes were insufficient for survival. This meant that virtually
all Cubans needed additional sources of income, preferably in dollars or
now in convertible pesos.]{.underline} To elaborate on this depiction of
the general eco-nomic situation of the citizens of Cuba in the Special
Period, consider their average incomes and the avail-ability of the
rationed goods and services. The aver-age wage or salary of Cuban
citizens in 1999 was 223pesos per month in the socialist economy
(CEPAL2000A, figure A.1), rising to 282 by April 2005(Granma, 22 de
Abril de 2005). At the official ex-change rate of relevance to Cuban
citizens over the2003 to 2005 period, namely 26--27 pesos per U.S.
dollar, this would amount to about \$US 9.00. Doc-tors, teachers,
engineers, and professors earned in the range of 200 to 450 pesos per
month and pensioners received 104 pesos per month (Espinosa Chepe,2001).
The state subsidy covering or reducing costs in many areas of life
(housing, electricity, education, health, etc.) reduces the typical
required expenditures for Cubans. However, official incomes in the peso
economy are still unable to cover the difference especially when many
essential products are available only in U.S. dollars or convertible
pesos. Virtually all citizens attest to the inadequacy of the peso
income to meet daily living requirements. The inadequacy of peso incomes
was confirmed in April 2005 when President Castro announced major wage
and pension increases for lower income citizens. Apparently, this was in
response to a report from a group of economists who were charged with
examining the growing poverty in Cuba (Frank, 3 May2005). The minimum
wage was increased from 100to 225 pesos per month, and the minimum
pension from 55 pesos to 150 pesos (Granma, 22 de abril de2005). As a
result of these changes, the average income --- from state sector
activity --- rose from 282to 312 pesos per month (ibid.). However, these
increases do not appear significant inconvertible pesos at the exchange
rate relevant for Cuban citizens (26 pesos per convertible peso in2005).
This is because the increased incomes will have to be spent on
non-rationed products. Products from the hard currency (former dollar)
stores (Tien-das para Recaudación de Divisas) require convertible pesos,
and include tax levels of 140%. Vegetables from the Mercados
Agropecuarios and the state vegetable markets are also market-determined
or close to it. Black market prices are also market determined and
relatively high. The purchasing power of the income increases for
pensioners and those on the minimum wage therefore does not appear to be
particularly significant. However, people in fact survived. They
purchased not only their required food, but other daily requirements as
well as household items, including furniture and electronic devices,
clothing, tobacco products, beverages, etc. People were able to survive
because they had other sources of income besides the incomes earned from
the official wage and salary system. There are a number of ways that
people can acquire additional incomes. First, some receive remittances
from family members or friends outside Cuba. In aggregate, the
remittances are significant, amounting to around \$US 700million by 2000
and perhaps around \$US 1,000 mil-lion (or about \$US 90.00 per person)
in the first years of the 2000s (Eckstein, 2004: 326). Second, some
Cubans acquire convertible pesos (formerly. dollars) from foreign travel
for governmental, business, or academic purposes. Third, income
supplements paid by foreign enterprises or international organizations
are technically illegal but presumably are known to the Cuban government
and tolerated. Fourth, some 140,000 Cubans earn incomes from
self-employment. Probably most of these earn rather modest incomes,
especially if they provide services to other Cuban citizens. A large
number of individuals formally or informally work as cuenta propistas.
This spreads any higher incomes that the cuenta propistas might earn
around somewhat. Fifth, another source of additional income for a few
people is work abroad in an officially sanctioned capacity, such as
working in Venezuela. Some artists and musicians also have the
possibility of traveling abroad more easily and vending their art and
their services outside the country. Sixth, many Cuban citizens also
earned tips from their work in the tourist sector or activities catering
to tourists and other foreigners.7 Seventh, income supplements in kind
or in cash (convertible pesos) have also been provided to considerable
numbers of workers in key sectors of the economy. [But what happens to
those citizens lacking access to]{.underline} any of these [sources of
supplementary income and unable to emigrate? Their economic situation
has been desperate. As seen above, their very survival could be in
jeopardy. Necessity is the primordial force pushing citizens into
economic illegalities of numerous sorts or into the underground
economy.]{.underline}

However it is necessary to know that this paranoia does not lack for
reasons, in respect to the direction of historical development. It is a
fact that at the point where we have arrived in the process of
socialization of society, [each individual act of destruction
constitutes an act of terrorism, that is to say it objectively aims at
the entire society.]{.underline} Thus, at the extreme of suicide that
manifests itself in a gesture where death and liberty blend, which
delimits, suspends, and annuls the sovereignty of Biopower -and which
acquires by that the meaning of a direct derogation of domination- sees
itself thus delight a strong force of consummation, of production and
reproduction of its world. Similarly, [when the law rests on nothing
more than its promulgation, that is to say on force and caprice, when
this enters a phase of autonomous proliferation, and atop it all, when
no ethos is no longer contained in it, then all crime must be
comprehended as a total contestation of a solidly ruined social
order.]{.underline} All murders are no longer the murder of a particular
person- if such a thing as a "particular person" is still possible- but
pure murder, without object or subject, without culprit or victim. It is
immediately an attempt against the law, which does not exist, but wishes
to reign everywhere. From now on, the tiniest infractions have changed
their meaning[. All crimes are become political crimes, and it is
precisely this that domination must at all costs make occult, to veil
from all that an epoch has passed, and that political violence, this
living corpse, comes to demand the reckoning of all the forms that one
does not know it in.]{.underline} It is in this manner, of which the
Spectacle could have an intuition, that as the Imaginary Party manifests
itself it is escorted by a certain trait of blind terrorism. Certainly,
one can interpret this as the moment of the interiorization by all
developed commodity societies of the negation that they hold in an
cathartic but illusory exteriority of "really existing socialism", but
it is there however its most superficial aspect. It is also permitted
for each to diminish the insoluble character by certifying the general
rule that "a political unity can not exist under the form of res
publica, of the public, which finds itself put into question each time
that it creates a space of non-publicity which is an effective disavowal
of this publicity". It is certainly not rare, thus, that certain take
the Party as "disappearing in the shadow, but transforming the shadow
into a strategic space from whence come the attacks which destroy the
place where until now imperium manifested itself, which dismantle the
vast background of official public life, that a technocratic
intelligence would not know to organize" (Carl Schmitt, Theory of the
Partisan). [It is a constant temptation, in effect, to conceive the
positive existence of the Imaginary Party under the familiar species of
the guerrilla, of civil war, of partisan warfare, of a conflict without
a precise front or a declaration of hostilities, without armistice or
peace treaty. And by these many aspects, it is verily a question of a
war that has nothing behind its acts, its violence, its crimes, and
which appear to have no other program, on this point, than to become
conscious violence, that is to say conscious of its metaphysical and
political character.]{.underline}

### FRAMING -- Economy

#### The disciplinary development of economics requires the West's strategy of alterity in order to create and order the boundedness of social space through controlling the Other, both inside and outside the borders of what it constitutes as a legitimate economy. The principle of rationality is given a material, economic form through this consolidation of the discipline via alterity -- thus the aff's theorization REQUIRES the policing of alternative, illicit economies in order to constitute its rationality.

economics. "Economics and the postcolonial other" in *Postcolonialism
Meets Economics, *Routledge Press, 2004, P 114-115 //tjb\]  

The purpose of this chapter is to outline the ways in which **[the very
disciplinary development of economics has been implicated in the West's
strategy of alterity]{.underline}**. But it is important also to reflect
on the fact that [the postcolonial reflection comes relatively late to
economics, after its formative work in the area of literary criticism
and its incursions in all other areas of social theory: history, law,
philosophy, anthropology]{.underline}. **[Arguably, the reason for this
coming-late can be found in the disciplinary structure of economics,
which seems capable of controlling the location of the other over the
complete space of being, on both the in-side and the out-side of the
borders of 'economy']{.underline}**. **[Taken on its own terms, the
disciplinary structure of economics would seem to leave no room for
undecidability, no liberty for the other of postcolonial interest to
imagine its own conditions of economy.]{.underline}** **[It must be a
priority of the postcolonial, then, to
understand just how the disciplinarity of economics would control the
place(ing) of the other over the social space]{.underline}**, and it is
to this task that the first section, titled 'The bordered space of the
economy,' is given. The implication of this approach is, of course,
that [**postcolonial reflection on economics must work to dissemble the
bordering of the social through which economics has ordered the places
and spaces of the other into the narrative of the West**.** It is not by
chance, I believe, that the first postcolonial reflection on economics
(on the structure of the theory of value) came in the form of Spivak's
(1985) deconstruction of the concept of 'value**]{.underline};' nor is
it by chance that this reflection (this very essay and this volume)
is pref- aced by a work of deconstruction (see,
e.g.: Amariglio 2002, Callari 2002 on the undecidability of the key
economic concepts of exchange and of value; Cullenberg et al. (2001) for
a general postmodern reflection on eco- nomics; and Charusheela (2000)
and Zein-Elabdin (1998, 2001) for a post- colonial confrontation of
modernist economics). As we will see in the first section, **[the
ability of economics to order the place of the other over the space of
the social derives from its construction of the 'economy' as a
homogeneous space, as an area bordered by the work of a set of
homogeneous (unimodal) exchange relations]{.underline}**. **[Crucial to
the disciplinarity of economics, this homogeneity has been
symbolized throughout its history by the search for a principle (and
theory) of value]{.underline}**. **[Moreover, in disciplinary
doctrine, the construction of this principle has been represented as a
matter of scientificity, as an expression of an abstract principle
of rationality by which economics could order the materiality of the
world of production into a structure]{.underline}**. But while economics
would rest its principle of disciplinarity, and thus its ability to
order the place of the other, on such scientific grounds, I will try to
show that **[the construction and disciplinary reproduction of this
principle was the product of the very operations of alterity through
which the West scripted its history]{.underline}**. As I will argue in
the first section, **[it is by reference to the concept of a social
division of labor]{.underline}** (henceforth DOL) -- **[the general idea
that the material activities of a society are re/distributed fluidly
across the social space in response to the rhythm of capacities and
needs, and in accordance to the idea of a rational organization of
production -- that the principle of rationality is given a material,
economic form]{.underline}**.  

 

#### Economics rests on universalizing and homogenizing exchange on the basis of social division of labor that enables the surveillance of economic space -- this is why it produces and depends on illicit economies. Non-exchange forms of subjectivity are outlawed and subsequently erased or controlled by economics' imagined structure of exchange. This is not a neutral process but rather a violent one. Economics as a field requires the disavowal of the materiality of social life in order to consolidate all of it into a structure of exchange -- other than the illicit, which escapes its rational borders and is therefore policed. 

**Callari 4 **\[Antonio Callari is the Sigmund M. and Mary B. Hyman

economics. "Economics and the postcolonial other" in *Postcolonialism
Meets Economics, *Routledge Press, 2004, P 115- 119 //tjb\] 

\*DOL = division of labor 

We start then with an overview of the disciplinary (disciplined and
disciplining) borders of orthodox economics: the other has a prescribed
relationship to this bordered space. **[The disciplinarity of economics
is given by the imagination of a bordered space (the "self-regulating,"
or "disembedded" economy]{.underline}** of Polanyi 1968, chapter
2) **[as a structure of relations defined either immediately as exchange
relations or by reference to these exchange relations]{.underline}**.
Now, **[this definition of the economic space has been compatible with
more than one imagined form of agency, and economic agents have thus
been alternatively theorized as calculators of labor values or of
utilities]{.underline}**. Beyond these differences, however, **[what has
remained invariant has been a dimension of homogeneity, whereby it is
'one' principle of calculability that, once chosen, invests equally all
agents: it is this homogeneity that allows the myriad of separate,
and otherwise incommensurable, acts of exchange to be structured into
'one' (thus, 'bordered') space]{.underline}**. **[These
borders would keep out forms of subjectivity which do not recognize
themselves in this calculus of 'exchange'
relations]{.underline}**. **[Non-exchange forms of subjectivity are, in
fact, unwelcome: not bound to the homogeneous calculation operations
that map all agents onto one bordered space, they would threaten that
very bordering
operation.]{.underline}** **[Economic disciplinarity needs to keep the
other (any other that would escape being disciplined into the imagined
structure of exchange) either out-side its borders or control its
movements with-in them]{.underline}**. We will see shortly how the
homogeneity of the economic space works indeed to prescribe the
place(ings) of the other. **[The structured homogeneous space we have
just described receives an economic body in the concept of the social
division of labor]{.underline}**.2 **[To say that the economy is
constituted as a homogeneous space means, in fact, more than to assert a
uniformity of the regime of calculability which structures the
multitudes of exchanges into a unity. It refers also to the structuring
into a unity of the various acts of production (and eventually also of
consumption), which are connected with the commodities being
exchanged]{.underline}**. It is just this structured unity of productive
activities that the concept of the DOL represents. **[In its economic
representation, moreover, the DOL refers not to just any given
distribution of productive activities but to a distribution which is
guided by, and reflects, the application of a form of rationality to the
world of production]{.underline}**. More than just the distribution of
labor, in fact, **[the concept of the DOL is a referent to the mobility
of producers across the economic space: it is this mobility that imparts
to the economy itself, and not just to each act of exchange, a certain
quality of calculability and makes it possible to think of the
distribution (or redis- tribution) of particular economic agents into
one structure -- that makes possible, that is, their mapping onto one
bordered space]{.underline}**. The structured unity of the economy that
the DOL effects is perhaps best seen in the founding text of economics
('political economy' at the time), Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations,
which indeed opens with a dis- cussion of the DOL. What marks Smith's as
a founding text of economics (presenting a unified object of analysis)
is the elevation of the concept of "wealth" to a level of generality
which had hitherto been unknown in pre- Smithian 'oeconomic' discourse,
where wealth had been hinged to partic- ular types of resources (e.g.
land, agricultural labor) or particular material forms (services,
bullion). Unlike his predecessors, Smith brings the organ- ization of
the whole of society's resources under the rubric of the DOL, and **[the
production of wealth becomes then not a matter of the prudent
management (including the social
arrangement) of particular activities (husbandry, or trade) but of the
rational organization of the entire field of material
production]{.underline}**. **[The DOL, Smith's entry into Wealth, is
thus nothing but the deployment of the idea of a unity (and I would like
to ask the reader to keep in mind that this unity is only possible as a
result of the mobility of resources and producers across various lines
of production, the ability of economic agents to detach themselves from
the particular material and social settings to which they are concretely
wedded) over a whole field of otherwise disparate and heterogeneous
material activities]{.underline}**. Arguably, then, **[the DOL gives the
genetic code of the economy, imparting a structural unity to the
productive activities that would give a real (material) content to the
generality of the concept of wealth -- and, indeed, to the extent that
they follow this structure, various economists go on to theorize the
economy through a series of generalities (labor in general, scarcity in
general, utility in general), thus reproducing the homogeneity of the
space of economy over the totality of social being through a
serialization of generalities.]{.underline}** As we will see in the
second section, **[it is exactly around the DOL that the West's
operation of alterity (posing the deficit state of the other) coalesced
to form the two most disciplinary moments of economic
knowledge]{.underline}**. In the remainder of this section, I want to
outline the ways in which **[the structured unity and homogeneity of the
economic space that crystallize this economic knowledge have allowed the
West to map the location and function of the other over the totality of
the social space]{.underline}**. The explanation here of
how **[the homogeneity of the economic space does not allow for the
operation of non-exchange based forms
of subjectivity]{.underline}** should all by itself go a considerable
way towards making clear the logic of alterity that economics offers,
namely that **[the other indeed does not have citizenship in the space
of the West (the economy) and that it belongs to a different order,
if it belongs to any order at all.]{.underline}** An understanding of
this logic of alterity by exclusion, however, will not be sufficient. As
Derrida's (1976) method of deconstruction suggests, **[the formation of
totalizing discourses is never so complete that it can banish to a state
of nonbeing that which is excluded from citizenship: the trace of the
excluded remains present, and it is the task of deconstruction to see
it. This would indeed seem to be the case with economics, where the
other, its lack of citizenship notwithstanding, nonetheless remains
present. Economics does not so much abolish the other (for it needs it
as a reference point with which to assert its own self), as it controls
its location in the social space.]{.underline}** **[Economic discourse
has used two strategies to contain the other]{.underline}**; it is not
surprising that these two strategies correspond largely to the two types
of economic knowledge whose formation in alterity we review in the next
section. **[The first strategy, found in the period of classical
political economy (CPE), is given by the relegation of the other to an
earlier stage of historical development -- and, in this case, the other
is quite explicitly the non-Western other.]{.underline}** In the
historicism of CPE, as practiced for example in the work of James Mill
(A History of British India) or in the writings of Marx (1974) on India,
this other appears quite explicitly, but as a marker of a lower level of
development, the structure or stages of which are given by the logic of
the economy of the West. Here, **[the other's social construction of
material production is never analyzed as having a coherence of its own
and the other thus is excluded, as such, from the field of economic
subjectivity]{.underline}**.3 **[The second strategy is given by the way
in which economists of a more recent twentieth-century vintage, working
within the scope of the late nineteenth-century cultural turn in social
theory, have gone about constructing a particular form of the
private--public dichotomy]{.underline}**.4 In this strategy, **[the
absorption of the non-Western other is carried out under the aegis not
of historicity, but of a structural differential. The economists'
construction of the private--public dichotomy works to create a space
for the absorption of the other within the space of the economy while
still denying its subjectivity]{.underline}**. **[In modern economics,
the public sphere has traditionally been fully occupied by the 'state'
conceived as a supra partes organ whose function is merely that of
filling the gaps left in the homogeneous space of private calculations
by such things as externalities and public goods.]{.underline}**5 But,
from the point of view of social theory, **[this remedial function of
the state is a residual function as well, for it can function
conceptually as a general space onto which everything that does not fit
the stylized 'private' form of exchange can be displaced and condensed,
all without threatening the unique definition of the social by the
'private.']{.underline}** Conflating the public sphere with the state,
economics can thus absorb the other into the dichotomy of public/private
of liberal ideology.6 **[This condensation of the public into a
remainder of the private imparts a certain trend to the discourse of
development, the one area where the non-Western other can still be found
explicitly in economics]{.underline}**.  

### NET BENEFIT -- Cartels

#### Third -- Phase Cartels have the ability to challenge nation-states and undermine US nation-building efforts.

**[Third-phase cartels]{.underline}**, if and when they emerge, [have
the potential to **pose a significant challenge to the modern
nation-state and its institutions.**]{.underline} [A third- phase cartel
is a consequence of unremitting corruption and co-option of state
institutions]{.underline}. While this \'criminal state successor\' has
yet to emerge, warning signs of its eventual arrival are present in many
states worldwide. Of immediate importance in the United States are
conditions favoring narco- or criminal-state evolution in Mexico. Thus
far, [Mexico has not developed into a kleptocracy, but the potential is
there. This echoes the pattern seen in Colombia.]{.underline} For
example, the Cali cartel infiltrated Colombia\'s society by using
complicity, intimidation, and fear of narco- terrorism, corruption and
indifference. These factors are increasingly evident in Mexico. Consider
Mexico\'s near-endemic pattern of assassinations, which have even rocked
Partido Revolucionario Institutional (Institutional Revolutionary Party
or PRI). The 23 March 1994 assassination of presidential candidate Luis
Donaldo Colosio and the 28 September 1994 daylight execution of PRI
secretary-generalF rancisco Ruiz Massieu are extreme examples. [These
events symbolize the lawlessness, corruption and fratricidal rivalry
among gangs and politicians aligned with competing **narco gangs** that
**are eroding social and civic institutions**]{.underline}. Such endemic
corruption and violence - frequently referred to as the
\'Colombianization of Mexico\' - result not from mere infiltration of
government, but from permeation of the government where the authorities
and drug traffickers are the same people. [Drug warfare, corruption and
the **co-option of the Mexican military are particularly alarming if one
considers that illicit drugs are among the most dynamic sectors of
Mexico\'s ailing economy**, with the result that the Mexican economy has
been largely propped up with narco-dollars.]{.underline} The majority of
Mexican cartels (Gulf, Tijuana, and so on) are seizing political control
through co-option rather than emerging as competitors to the state (as
in the example of Colombia\'s Medellin cartel). This allows the cartels
to exert greater influence within segments of the \'government\'. Rather
than being a competitor for political-economic dominance, the cartels
seek avenues for enabling their activities. **[Co-option and corruption
are thus aimed at removing the cartels from the limits of state
sovereignty]{.underline}**. [Such corruption and distortion of the
state, where **criminal organizations** are fused to the existing state
hierarchy like a parasite or gain local dominance within an exiting
state**, can** potentially **lead to the emergence of the third-phase
cartel acting as a criminal free state or enclave.**]{.underline} This
trend is evident in some parts of Mexico - notably Sinaloa and Quintana
Roo. Over 200 well-armed gangs operate in Sinaloa. These criminal
enterprises transcend drug running, embracing highway robbery, murder-
for-hire and kidnapping. Sinaloan drug cartels emerged in the 1970s and
1980s to stabilize and control the drug trade, minimizing the impact of
violence on the community. This tacit agreement is now unraveling as new
traffickers are emerging to replace their defunct predecessors.
(Sinaloan drug lords Joaquin \'El Chapo\' Guzman and Hector \'El Guero\'
Palma are in prison, and Amado Carillo Fuentes is dead.) Their
replacements, a new breed of trafficker, are more callous, less willing
to accept control or moderation, and criminally ambitious. Mexican
traffickers are expanding their reach to less patrolled areas, using
corruption to virtually take over states such as Quintana Roo (which
includes Cancun). Quintana Roo is not only viewed as a hotbed of
co-opted government and corruption but, in the eyes of some, \'has
become a narco- state.\'\' A network of government protection supports
Quintana Roo\'s cartels. Police protect drug shipments, and corruption
allegations linking Quintana Roo\'s government to drug trafficlung have
appeared in Reforma and Processo. These charges have been supported by
US and Mexican intelligen\~e.\~ Catalysts favoring the emergence of the
third phase cartel are poor economic performance, conflict between (and
within) traditional oligarchies (such as in Mexico within the PRI or
between federal and state governments) and social, economic and ethnic
disparities. Indicators of transition include increased conflict,
political turmoil, increased \'symbolic\' violence (assassinations of
politicians, judicial and police officials, journalists, and human
rights workers), increased violence/engagements between co-opted
factions of the police, enhanced employment of mercenaries, devaluation
of currency, and increased migration. [These issues are also present in
Haiti, a failing state a few hundred miles off the US coast. **Efforts
toward building a democratic government have been thwarted by endemic
corruption**]{.underline}. International drug cartels are infiltrating
Haiti\'s impoverished society, co-opting politicians, corrupting police
and fueling disorder. [The **drug trade is filling the void in
government stability** and international monetary aid, **undermining US
nation-building efforts** contingent upon fostering an effective,
corruption free modern police force. **Corruption and political
stalemate contribute to the existence of a virtual
narco-state.**]{.underline} The fullest development of a criminal
enclave exists in the South American jungle at the intersection of three
nations. Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, is the center of this criminal near
free state. Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina converge at this riverfront
outpost. A jungle hub for the world\'s outlaws, a global village of
outlaws, the triple border zone serves as a free enclave for significant
criminal activity, including people who are dedicated to supporting and
sustaining acts of terrorism. Denizens of the enclave include Lebanese
terrorists, Colombian drug smugglers, Nigerian gangsters and,
emphasizing its role as a beachhead for Asian mafias, Japanese Yakuza,
Tai Chen (Cantonese mafia), Fuk Ching, the Big Circle Boys, and the
Flying Dragons. Within the enclave, a polyglot mix of thugs demonstrates
the potential of criminal netwarriors to exploit the globalization of
organized crime. **[The blurring of borders]{.underline}** - a symbol of
the post-modem, information age - **[is clearly demonstrated
here,]{.underline}** where the mafias exploit interconnected economies.
**[With the ability to overwhelm governments weakened by corruption and
jurisdictional obstacles]{.underline}**, the mafias of Ciudad del Este
and its Brazilian twin city of Foz do Iguacu demonstrate remarkable
power and reach. Terrorism interlocks with organized crime in the
enclave, a post- modem free city that is a haven to Middle Eastern
terrorists, a hub for the European and US drug trade, a center for
compact disc, video and software piracy, and base for gunrunners
diverting US weapons to the violent and heavily armed drug gangs in the
favelas of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The convergence of cartel
evolution and manifestation of Internetted criminal enterprises is so
pronounced in this enclave, that we call the third phase cartel the
Ciudad del Este model. **[The transnational criminal organizations here
demonstrate the potential for criminal networks to challenge state
sovereignty and gain local dominance]{.underline}**. **[These networked
\'enclaves\' or a third phase cartel embracing similar characteristics
could become a dominant actor within a network of transnational criminal
organizations, and potentially gain legitimacy or at least political
influence within the network of state actor]{.underline}**

#### Drug Lords such as El Chapo are vital to community growth as well as development of infrastructure. 

**Eustachewich 2018** (Lia Eustachewich. American Journalist and
reporter at New York Post. New York Post: El Chapo is still a hero in
Mexico. November 13^th^, 2018. Date Accessed: 7.29.19. /// ONW)

Despite being criminally charged as the head of a violent cartel that's
responsible for countless murders and pumping tons of drugs into the
United States, Joaquin "[**El Chapo**" Guzman **is** still **regarded as
a hero back in Mexico.**]{.underline} In Culiacan, the capital of
Sinaloa, street vendors hawk figurines of the 61-year-old toting guns
and hats emblazoned with "701" --- his ranking on Forbes' 2009
billionaires list, according to Agence France-Presse. "El Chapo was a
media star. He had a theatrical streak, and that put the spotlight on
him even more," said Tomas Guevara, a sociologist at the University of
Sinaloa. [Guzman's reputation as a living legend is part of the local
"narco culture" where **dangerous drug lords are beloved by the
community** just as much as they are feared**.**]{.underline} And Guzman
--- whose trial on a slew of drug trafficking charges [gets underway
Tuesday](https://nypost.com/2018/11/13/el-chapos-wife-stuns-as-she-appears-for-drug-lords-trial/)
in Brooklyn federal court --- has a rags-to-riches story, selling fruit
on the street as a boy, then growing marijuana and opium poppies at age
15 before being recruited into the Guadalajara cartel. Guzman left that
enterprise to start his own Sinaloa cartel with two others, and together
they turned their home-grown operation into a multibillion-dollar
international operation. Adding to his celebrity appeal are his two
dramatic jailbreaks from maximum-security prisons --- allegedly by
hiding in a laundry basket, and then through a nearly mile-long tunnel
dug under his jail cell. ["Narco culture" is on full display at the
Jardines de Humaya cemetery in Culiacan, where the bodies of former
kingpins lie in luxurious tombs with bulletproof glass and air
conditioning. Nearby, locals pack a chapel dedicated to Jesus Malverde,
the so-called "narco saint]{.underline}" with a Robin Hood-esque
reputation. Folklore says he stole from the rich to give to the poor in
early 20th-century Sinaloa. "**[The narcos' original idea --- and this
is how they won people's hearts --- is that they built roads to the
villages, installed electricity, gave them money to build a church,"
said Guevara. "They did the things the state was supposed to do and
didn't.]{.underline}**" Guadalupe Bustamente said she started praying at
the chapel when she was diagnosed with cancer. "**[I imagine \[drug
traffickers'\] faith must be great indeed, because it's gotten them
through very big, serious problems]{.underline}**," the 35-year-old
said. "Matters of life and death, because that's the reality here."

#### Cartels are charitable and help their communities -- their demonization is a war on drugs propaganda tool the US has used in order to justify their routine invasions and abusive foreign policy

[Public relations has become meat and potatoes to big charitable givers,
and so it seems to have evolved in Mexico with a unique charitable
giver---the Gulf Cartel. One of the largest drug cartels in Mexico, the
Gulf Cartel, has a video on YouTube showing its members visiting
schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and neighborhoods in Tamaulipas state
to give away cakes decorated in the colors of the Mexican flag. The Gulf
Cartel's charitable message is, according to a caption embedded in the
video, "We take care of our people and always help." Newsweek describes
the video as "narco public relations," but to us, it is a variant:
narco-charity. It represents a new approach by the cartel for winning
the hearts and minds of the population, a sharp change from murders,
public hangings, and decapitations. But it isn't unique. Longtime
Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar was known for paying for street
lighting and reforestation projects and for building public housing and
soccer fields, making him quite beloved in parts of Colombia. In Mexico,
Gulf Cartel leader Osiel Cárdenas Guillén sent dolls, roller skates, and
bicycles to Tamaulipas, with each toy tagged with a sticker advising the
children, "Perseverance, discipline and effort are the basis for
success. Keep studying to be a great example. Happy Children's Day. With
all my warmth for tomorrow's triumphant one...your friend: Osiel
Cárdenas Guillén]{.underline}." The idea of organized crime kingpins
acting charitably is not new. In the U.S., some of the most infamous
criminals in history used charitable giving much like the leaders of the
Gulf Cartel or earlier like Colombia's Escobar[. Al Capone, for example,
actually established some of the first soup kitchens in Chicago during
the Great Depression. After World War II, Bugsy Siegel helped finance
Holocaust survivors moving to the embryonic state of Israel. Across the
Pacific, Yakuza criminal gangs sent dozens of trucks loaded with
supplies to northeast Japan after the March 2011
earthquake]{.underline}. For the Gulf Cartel leadership, what is new is
the use of social media to promote their charitable activities. The
distinctive factor in much of the charity of organized crime, whether by
Capone and Siegel, the Yakuza, or the cartels, is that it tends to
flourish when there is an absence of official government presence.
Capone during the Great Depression and the Yakuza coming from Kobe and
Tokyo to the earthquake zone where 27,000 people died are examples of
criminally based charity operating where the authorities were
under-resourced[. The same goes for the Gulf Cartel in Mexico, providing
charitable gifts and publicizing the activity with impunity because of
the weakness of governmental forces where it operates.---Rick
Cohen]{.underline}

### ALT -- Imaginary Party

#### Thus we affirm the Imaginary Party-Different from past revolutions our only goal is the dissaperance of regimes of oppression-we make no claim to legitimacy and found our cause on nothing-This makes it the greatest danger the state has ever faced.

**The Invisible Committee and Tiqqun'99**(The Invisible Committee and
Tiqqun "Theses on the Imaginary Party" 1999 Retrieved From
<https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/tiqqun-theses-imaginary-party>
7/29/19)

[Those of the Imaginary Party fight irregularly.]{.underline} They are
engaged in this Spanish war where the spectacular occupier is ruined by
stationing troops and material, and where a rampant dialectical paroxysm
in the terms of which "the force and the importance of irregularity are
determined by the force and the importance that the regular organization
puts in place" (Carl Schmitt), and inversely. The Imaginary Party can
count upon this constant: that a handful of partisans suffices to
immobilize all the "Party of Order". In this war that the present
abandons itself to, there remains nothing of a jus belli[. Hostility is
absolute. The "Party of Order" itself is not reluctant to recall from
one time to another: it is necessary to operate as a partisan wherever
there are partisans---it suffices to know what prisons have become in
the last decade, and how diverse police forces have in the same time
taken the habit of proceeding with "marginals", to comprehend that such
a watchword can signify bloody caprice.]{.underline} Thus, as long as
commodity domination subsists, those of the Imaginary Party must expect
to receive from it consideration as criminals to be dealt with, or as
partridges to be shot down, depending on the circumstances. **[The
disproportion of weapons and punishments that it already brandishes
against them does not join itself to any conjuncture of political
repression, it is consubstantial with what it is, and with what its
enemy is]{.underline}**. What expresses this is the simple fact that the
Imaginary Party contains in its principle the negation of all that upon
which commodity domination erects itself, the negation that will
manifest itself in action before manifesting itself as discourse.
[Different from the revolutions of the past, the coming insurrection
does not call upon any secular transcendence save the continued
disappearance of so many regimes of oppression eager to justify
themselves that end up by being hated. At no moment does it pretend to
draw its legitimacy from the People, from Opinion, from the Church, the
Nation, or the Working Class, even under an attenuated form. It founds
it cause on nothing, but this nothingness it knows to be identical to
being. That its crimes evidence such a miraculous sovereignty, this
proves that it inscribes itself in no particular transcendence, residing
dead; rather that it roots itself in Transcendence itself, and that
without intermediary]{.underline}. **[It is by this that it represents
for the capitalist State the most considerable peril that it has ever
seen facing it]{.underline}**. That which hereafter acts as an obstacle
does not contest this or that aspect of rights, nor this or that law, it
attacks rather that which precedes all laws, the obligation of
obedience. Worse still, the partisan of the Imaginary Party develops in
the most complete violation of all the existing rules without ever
having the sentiment of transgressing them, acting in disdain of them.
They do not oppose themselves to rights, they depose them[. It aspires
to a superior justification to all the written and unwritten laws: the
text without a law that it is. It thus renews the absolute scandal of
the Sabbattean doctrine, which affirmed that "the accomplishing of the
law is its transgression", and left it behind. It itself constitutes, in
so much as it is the living abolition of the ancient law which shares,
divides, and separates, a scrap of Tiqqun. It responds to the state of
exception by the state of exception, and thus returns the whole
juridical edifice back to its sad unreality]{.underline}. [Finally it
represents no one, and not from a lack, but on the contrary by excess,
by the refusal of even the principal of representation. Starting from
the fundamental irreducibility of all human existence, it proclaims
itself as non-susceptible to representation, as the un-representable,
but also as the un-representing]{.underline}. Analogous in this to the
totality of language, or of the world, it defies all concrete
equivalencies. Such an Imaginary Party that renders all monuments to law
infamous from its origin as a Roman fiction takes the capitalist State
back to the ranks of an association of criminals only more
consequential, more organized and more powerful than others. This
presumes nothing of any social disorganization: Chicago in the 1920's
was administered in an exemplary fashion. As we see[, the Imaginary
Party is also fundamentally anti-state and anti-popular. Nothing is more
odious to it than the idea of political unity, if not maybe obedience.
In the present conditions, it can be nothing other than the non-party of
the multitude because, as the contemptible Hobbes remarked aptly, "when
the citizens rebel against the State, they are the multitude against the
people".]{.underline}

### FRAMING -- Planning bad

#### Planning is bad-distracts from politics of now-It leads to fear of conflict that makes resistance inevitably fail. Planning seeks to control the movement and otherizes alternate forms of resistance.

[A real political force can be constructed only from near to near and
from moment to moment,]{.underline} and not through a mere statement of
purposes. Besides, determining ends is still a means. One uses means
only in a situation. Even a marathon is always run step by step. This
way of situating what is political in the nearby, which is not the
domestic, is the most precious contribution of a certain autonomous
feminism. In its time, it threw the ideology of entire leftist parties,
armed ones, into a crisis. The fact that feminists subsequently
contributed to re-distancing the nearby, the "everyday," by ideologizing
it, by politicizing it externally, discursively, constitutes the part of
the feminist legacy that one can very well decline to accept. And to be
sure, [everything in this world is designed to distract us from what is
there, very close. The "everyday" is predisposed to be the place which a
certain stiffness would like to preserve from conflicts and affects that
are too intense. It's precisely that very cowardice that lets everything
slide and ends up making the everyday so sticky and our relations so
viscous. If we were more serene, more sure of ourselves, if we had less
fear of conflict and of the disruption an encounter might bring, their
consequences would likely be less disagreeable. And perhaps not
disagreeable at all.]{.underline}

### ALT EXTENSION -- Revolutionary Violence

#### Revolution is key to the prevention of the growing state and causes abrupt chaos as a form of catharsis for the people enduring continual forms of violence.

[This whole mirage dissolves when a revolution breaks out]{.underline}.
Suddenly [what seemed eternal collapses into time as though into a
bottomless pit.]{.underline} [What seemed to plunge its roots into the
human heart turns out to have been nothing but a fable for dupes. The
palaces are vacated and one discovers in the prince's abandoned jumble
of papers that he no longer believed in it all, if he ever had. For
behind the façade of the institution, what goes on is always something
other than it claims to be, its precisely what the institution claimed
to have delivered the world from]{.underline}: the very human comedy of
the coexistence of networks, of loyalties, of clans, interests,
lineages, dynasties even, a logic of fierce struggles for territories,
resources, miserable titles, influence--- stories of sexual conquest and
pure folly, of old friendships and rekindled hatreds. Every institution
is, in its very regularity, the result of an intense bricolage and, as
an institution, of a denial of that bricolage. It's supposed fixity
masks a gluttonous appetite for absorbing, controlling,
institutionalizing everything that's on its margins and harbors a bit of
life. The real model of every institution is universally the Church.
Just as the Church clearly does not have as its goal leading the human
flock to its divine salvation, but rather achieving its own salvation in
time, the alleged function of an institution is only a pretext for its
existence. In every institution the Legend of the Grand Inquisitor is
re-enacted year after year. Its true purpose is to persist. [**No need
to specify how many souls and bodies must be ground down in order to
secure this result, and even within its own hierarchy. One doesn't
become a leader without being basically the most ground down---the king
of the ground-down. Reducing delinquency and "defending society" are
only the pretext of the carceral institution**. If, during the centuries
it has existed, it has never succeeded at these things---on the
contrary---this is because its purpose is different; it is to go on
existing and growing if possible, which means tending to the breeding
ground of delinquency and managing the illegalities.]{.underline} The
purpose of the medical institution is not to care for people's health,
but to produce the patients that justify its existence and a
corresponding definition of health. Nothing new on this subject since
Ivan Illich and his Medical Nemesis. It's not the failure of the health
institutions that we are now living in a world that is toxic through and
through and that makes everyone sick. On the contrary, we've seen their
triumph. Quite often, the apparent failure of the institutions is their
real function. If school discourages children from learning, this is not
fortuitously: it's because children with a desire to learn would make
school next to useless. The same goes for the unions, whose purpose is
manifestly not the emancipation of workers, but rather the perpetuation
of their condition. What could the bureaucrats of the labor unions do
with their life, in fact, if the workers had the bad idea of actually
freeing themselves? Of course in every institution there are sincere
people who really think they are there to accomplish their mission. But
it's no accident if those people see themselves systematically
obstructed, are systematically kept out of the loop, punished, bullied,
eventually ostracized, with the complicity of all the "realists" who
keep their mouths shut. These choice victims of the institution have a
hard time understanding its double talk, and what is really being asked
of them. Their fate is to always be treated there as killjoys, as
rebels, and to be endlessly surprised by that.

**People are incentivized to revolt now at the hand of the violence they
experience in their communities. It is too late the revolution is
happening now.**

While, compared to the police, [revolutionaries may currently present
themselves as weak, unarmed, unorganized, and watch-listed, they have
the strategic advantage, however, of being nobody's instrument, of
having no order to maintain, and of not being a corps. We
revolutionaries are not bound by any obedience, we are connected to all
sorts of comrades, friends, forces, milieus, accomplices, and allies.
This enables us to bring to bear on certain police interventions the
threat that an operation to enforce order might trigger an unmanageable
disorder in return.]{.underline} If since the failure of Operation
Caesar, no government has dared to try and expel the ZAD, it's not out
of a fear of losing the battle militarily, but because the reaction of
tens of thousands of sympathizers could prove to be unmanageable. That a
"blunder" in a banlieue sets off weeks of widespread riots is too high a
price to pay for the Specialized Brigade's license to humiliate. [When
an intervention by the police causes more disorder than what it
reestablishes in the way of order, it's their very reason for being
that's in question. So, either they insist and end up emerging as a
party with its own interests, or they go back into their kennel. Either
way, they cease being a useful means. They are destituted.There is a
basic asymmetry between the police and revolutionarie]{.underline}s.
[Whereas they take us as the target of their operations, our aims reach
far beyond them---it's the general policing of society, it's very
organization, that we have in our line of sight**. The outrageousness of
police prerogatives and the incredible expansion of the technological
means of control delineate a new tactical perspective. A purely public
existence places revolutionaries before the alternative of a practical
impotence or an immediate repression.**]{.underline} [A purely
conspiratorial existence does allow a greater freedom of action, but
makes one politically inoffensive and vulnerable to repression. So it's
a matter of combining a capacity for mass dissemination and a necessary
conspiratorial level. Organizing revolutionarily entails a subtle
interplay between the visible and the invisible, the public and the
clandestine, the legal and the illegal. **We have to accept that our
struggle is essentially criminal, since in this world everything has
become criminalizable**]{.underline}. [Even the militants who go in aid
of the migrants have to use clever tricks to evade the surveillance of
which they are the object, before they can act freely. A revolutionary
force can be constructed only as a network, a step at a time, by relying
on sure friendships, by furtively establishing unanticipated ties even
within the enemy apparatus]{.underline}. This is how the "tanzikiyat"
were formed in Syria, as a web of little autonomous pockets of
revolutionaries that would later become the backbone of popular
selforganization. In their day, the first French Resistance networks
didn't do things differently. In the case of Syria as in the old maquis,
by successfully reclaiming urban districts and areas of the countryside,
by establishing relatively secure zones, it became possible to go beyond
the stage of discrete, anonymous activity on the part of little groups.
"Life is in the use, not in the time," as Manouchian put it.

#### Outrage by the people leads to the destruction of the state as people engage in violent insurrection. The state inevitably has to succumb to that chaos. We won't stop until we destroy everything and more. 

**Comite Invisible '14 (Comite Invisible, nom de plume of an anonymous
author or [authors who have written French works of literature based on
far-left politics, and anarchism, To Our Friends,

) SO**

Anyone who lived through the days of [December, 2008 in
Athens]{.underline} knows what the word "insurrection" signifies in a
Western metropolis. [The banks were in pieces, the police stations under
siege, the city in the hands of the assailants]{.underline}. In the
luxury shops, they were no longer repairing the windows, which would
need to be done every morning. [Nothing that embodied the police reign
of normality was untouched by this wave of fire and stones whose bearers
were everywhere and representatives nowhere]{.underline}---even the
Syntagma Christmas tree was torched. At a certain point the forces of
order withdrew, after running out of tear-gas grenades. Impossible to
say who took over the streets then. They say it was the "600 euros
generation," the "high schoolers," the "anarchists," the "riffraff" from
the Albanian immigration, they'll say anything. [As usual, the press
blamed the]{.underline} "koukoulofori," the ["hooded ones."]{.underline}
The truth is that [the anarchists were overrun by this faceless
outpouring of rage]{.underline}. Their monopoly on wild, masked action,
inspired tags, and even Molotov cocktails had been taken from them
unceremoniously. [The general uprising they no longer dared to imagine
was there, but it didn't resemble the idea of it they had in their
minds.]{.underline} An unknown entity, an egregore, had been born, [a
spirit that wouldn't be appeased till everything was reduced to cinders
that deserved to be. Time was on fire. The present was fractured as
payment for all the future that had been stolen from us.]{.underline}
The years that followed in Greece taught us the meaning of the word
"counter-insurgency" in a Western country. Once the wave had passed, the
hundreds of groups that had formed in the country, down to the smallest
villages, tried to stay faithful to the breach which the month of
December had opened. At one spot, people might empty the cash registers
of a supermarket, then film themselves burning the loot. At another, [an
embassy might be attacked in broad daylight in solidarity with some
friend hounded by the police in his or her country]{.underline}. Some
resolved, as in Italy of the 1970's, [to carry the attack to a higher
level and target, using bombs or firearms]{.underline}, the Athens stock
exchange, cops, ministries or perhaps the Microsoft headquarters. As in
the 1970's, the left passed new "antiterrorist" laws. [The raids,
arrests, and trials multiplied.]{.underline} For a time, one was reduced
to militating against "repression." The European Union, the World Bank,
the IMF, in agreement with the Socialist government, undertook to make
Greece pay for the unpardonable revolt. One should never underestimate
the resentment of the wealthy towards the insolence of the poor. They
decided to bring the whole country to heel through a string of "economic
measures" more or less as violent, although spread over time, as the
revolt. This was met by dozens of general strikes called by the unions.
Workers occupied ministries; inhabitants took possession of city halls;
university departments and hospitals that had been "sacrificed" decided
to self-organize. There was the "movement of the squares." May 10, 2010,
five hundred thousand of us flooded into the center of Athens. There
were several attempts to burn the Parliament. February 12, 2012, an
umpteenth general strike was staged in desperate opposition to the
umpteenth austerity plan. That Sunday, all of Greece, its retirees, its
anarchists, [its civil servants, its workers and its homeless
demonstrated in a state of near-insurrection.]{.underline} With downtown
Athens again in flames, that evening was a paroxysm of jubilation and
weariness: the movement perceived all its power, but also realized it
didn't know what to do with it. Over the years, in spite of thousands of
direct actions, hundreds of occupations, millions of Greeks in the
streets, the euphoria of rebellion was dampened in the drop-box of
"crisis." The embers stayed active under the ashes, certainly. The
movement found other forms, providing itself with cooperatives, social
centers, "networks of exchange without middlemen," and even self-managed
factories and health clinics. It became more "constructive" in a sense.
The fact remains that we were defeated, that one the biggest offensives
of our party during the past few decades was repulsed through debt
impositions, exaggerated prison sentences, and generalized bankruptcy.
The free used clothing won't make Greeks forget the counter-insurgency's
determination to plunge them up to their necks in privation. Power may
have tottered and given the momentary impression of disappearing, but it
was able to shift the terrain of confrontation and catch the movement
off balance. [The Greeks were blackmailed by this alternative:
"government or chaos." What they got was government and chaos---plus
immiseration as a bonus. With its anarchist movement stronger than
anywhere else, with its people largely uneasy with the very fact of
being governed, with its always-already failed state,]{.underline}
Greece stands as a textbook case of our defeated insurrections. Jacking
the police, smashing the banks and temporarily routing a government is
still not destituting it all. What the Greek case shows us is that
without a concrete idea of what a victory would be, we can't help but be
defeated. [Insurrectionary determination is not enough; our confusion is
still too thick. Hopefully, studying our defeats will serve at least to
dissipate it somewhat.]{.underline}

### A2 COOPTION

#### Destituent power means no cooption

**The Invisible Committee 17** (Now, aka when the revolution
begins)//e-toth

Against the slightest revolutionary possibility in France, one will
always find the institution of the Self and the Self of the institution.
Inasmuch as "being someone" always comes down finally to the recognition
of, the allegiance to, some institution, inasmuch as succeeding involves
conforming to the reflection that you're shown in the hall of mirrors of
the social game, the institution has a grip on everyone through the
Self. All this couldn't last, would be too rigid, not dynamic enough, if
the institution wasn't determined to compensate for its rigidity by a
constant attention to the movements that jostle it. [There's a perverse
dialectic between institution and movements, which testifies to the
former's relentless survival instinct. A reality as ancient, massive,
and hieratic as that, inscribed in the bodies and minds of its subjects
for the hundreds of years the French state has existed, could not have
lasted so long if it had not been able to tolerate, monitor, and
recuperate critics and revolutionaries as they presented themselves. The
carnivalesque ritual of social movements function within it as a safety
valve, as a tool for managing the social as well as for renewing the
institution. They bring it the flexibility, the young flesh, the new
blood that it so cruelly lacks. Generation after generation, in its
great wisdom, the state has been able to coopt those who showed
themselves amenable to being bought off, and crush those who acted
intransigent. It's not for nothing that so many leaders of student
movements have so naturally advanced to ministerial posts, being people
who are sure to have a feel for the state, that is, an appreciation of
the institution as mask. Breaking the circle that turns our contestation
into a fuel for what dominates us, marking a rupture in the fatality
that condemns revolutions to reproduce what they have driven out,
shattering the iron cage of counter-revolution---this is the purpose of
destitution. The notion of destitution is necessary in order to free the
revolutionary imaginary of all the old constituent fantasies that weigh
it down, of the whole deceptive legacy of the French Revolution. It is
necessary to intervene in revolutionary logic, in order to establish a
division within the idea of insurrection.]{.underline} For there are
constituent insurrections, those that end like all the revolutions up to
now have ended: by turning back into their opposite, those that have
been made "in the name of "---in the name of whom or what? the people,
the working class, or God, it matters little. And [there are destituent
insurrections, such as May '68, the Italian creeping May and so many
insurrectionary communes. Despite all that it may have manifested that
was cool, lively, unexpected, Nuit debout---like the Spanish movement of
the squares or Occupy Wall Street previously---was troubled by the old
constituent itch. What was staged spontaneously was the old
revolutionary dialectic that would oppose the "constituted powers" with
the "constituent power" of the people taking over the public
space.]{.underline} There's a good reason that in the first three weeks
of Nuit debout, Place de la Republique, no fewer than three committees
appeared that gave themselves the mission of rewriting a Constitution.
What was re-enacted there was the old debate that's been performed to a
full house in France since 1792. And it seems there's no getting enough
of it. It's a national sport. There's not even any need to spruce up the
decor to please today's taste. It must be said that the idea of
constitutional reform presents the advantage of satisfying both the
desire to change everything and the desire that everything stay the
same---it's just a matter, finally, of changing a few lines, of symbolic
modifications. As long as one debates words, as long as revolution is
formulated in the language of rights and the law, the ways of
neutralizing it are well-known and marked out.

### A2 PERM

#### The permutation is just another claim to legitimacy. We must destitute every claim to power. We are all that surrounds us.

**The Invisible Committee 14** (To our friends, probably not
you)//e-toth

Use: Answering the permutation to the K---critique of pacifist politics
and denies "the existence of otherness"---you probably need some real
world examples about why that's true but whatever

Forty years of triumphant counterrevolution in the West have inflicted
two matching weaknesses on us: pacifism and radicalism. They're both
harmful, but in combination they form a pitiless apparatus. [Pacifism
lies, and lies to itself, by making public discussion and general
assembly the be-all and end-all of political practice. That explains why
the squares movement, for example, was incapable of becoming anything
more than a terminal starting point.]{.underline} To grasp what the
political means, there seems to be no choice but to take another detour
through Greece, but ancient Greece this time. After all, the political
was invented there. Pacifists are reluctant to remember this, but early
on the ancient Greeks invented democracy as a continuation of war by
other means. The assembly practice on the scale of the city-state came
directly from the assembly of warriors. Equality of speech stemmed from
equality in the face of death. Athenian democracy was a hoplitic
democracy. One was a citizen because one was a soldier---hence the
exclusion of women and slaves. In a culture as violently agonistic as
classical Greek culture, debate itself was understood as a moment of
warlike confrontation, between citizens this time, in the sphere of
speech, with the arms of persuasion. Moreover, "agon" signifies
"assembly" as much as "competition." The complete Greek citizen was one
who was victorious both with arms and with discourse. Above all, the
ancient Greeks conceived assembly democracy in combination with warfare
as organized carnage, and the former as the guarantor of the latter.
It's significant that the Greeks are credited with the invention of
democracy only on condition that its link with that rather exceptional
type of massacre based on the phalanx is glossed over---that is, with
the invention of a form of line warfare that replaces skill, bravery,
prowess, extraordinary strength, and genius with pure and simple
discipline, absolute submission of each to the whole. When the Persians
found themselves facing such an effective way of waging war, but one
that reduced the life of the foot soldier in the phalanx to nothing,
they rightly judged it to be perfectly barbaric, as did so many of those
enemies whom the Western armies were to crush subsequently. The Athenian
farmer getting himself heroically slaughtered in the front rank of the
phalanx in view of his friends and relatives was thus the flip side of
the active citizen taking part in the Boule. [**The lifeless arms of the
corpses strewn over the ancient battlefield were the necessary
counterparts of the arms raised to intervene in the deliberations of the
assembly**.]{.underline} This Greek model of warfare is so firmly
entrenched in the Westerm imaginary it's almost forgotten that at the
very time when the hoplites were awarding the victory to that phalanx of
the two that would accept the maximun number of deaths in the decisive
clash rather than yield ground, the Chinese were inventing an art of war
that consisted precisely in minimizing losses and avoiding battle as
much as possible, in trying to "win the battle before the battle"---even
if this also meant exterminating the defeated army once the victory was
obtained. The equation "war=confrontation army=carnage" extended from
ancient Greece down through the 20th century. It's basically been the
aberrant Western definition of warfare for two thousand five hundred
years. That "irregular warfare," "psychological warfare," "little war"
or "guerilla" are the names given to what is elsewhere the norm of
warfare is only one aspect of that particular aberration. [The sincere
pacifist, one who is not simply rationalizing his own cowardice,
performs the feat of being doubly mistaken about the nature of the
phenomenon he claims to be combating. Not only is war not reducible to
armed confrontation or carnage, it is the very matrix of the assembly
politics that the pacifist advocates.]{.underline} "A real warrior,"
said Sun Tzu, "is not bellicose. A real fighter is not violent. A victor
avoids combat." Two world conflicts and a terrifying planetary fight
against "terrorism" have shown us that the bloodiest campaigns of
extermination are conducted in the name of peace. At bottom, [**the
rejection of war only expresses an infantile or senile refusal to
recognize the existence of otherness**. War is not carnage, but the
logic that regulates the contact of heterogeneous powers. It is waged
everywhere, in countless forms, and more often than not by peaceful
means. If there's multiplicity of worlds, if there's an irreducible
plurality of forms of life, then war is the law of their co-existence on
this earth.]{.underline} For nothing allows us to foresee the outcome of
their encounter: contraries don't dwell in separate worlds. If we are
not unified individuals endowed with a definitive identity as the social
policing of roles would have it, but the locus of a conflictual play of
forces whose successive configurations only form temporary equilibriums,
we have to recognize that war is in us---holy war, as Rene Daumal called
it. [Peace is neither possible nor desirable. Conflict is the very stuff
of what exists. So the thing to do is to acquire an art of conducting
it, which is an art of living on a situational footing, and which
requires a finesse and an existential mobility instead of a readiness to
crush whatever is not us. Pacifism attests therefore either to a deep
stupidity or a complete lack of good faith. Even our immune system
depends on the distinction between friend and enemy, without which we
would die of cancer or some other autoimmune disease.]{.underline}
Actually, we do die of cancers and autoimmune diseases. The tactical
refusal of confrontation is itself only a stratagem of warfare. It's
easy to understand, for example, why the Oaxaca Commune immediately
declared itself peaceful. [It wasn't a matter of refuting war, but of
refusing to be defeated in a confrontation with the Mexican state and
its henchmen]{.underline}. As some Cairo comrades explained it, ["One
mustn't mistake the tactic we employ when we chant 'nonviolence' for a
fetishizing of non-violence." It's amazing, furthermore, how much
historical falsification it takes to find fore-bears who are presentable
to pacifism!]{.underline} Think of poor Thoreau who was barely deceased
when they made him into a theoretician of Civil Disobedience, by
amputating the title of his text, Resistance to Civil Government. This
was the man who wrote in longhand in his Plea for Captain John Brown: "
I think that for once the Sharpe's rifles and the revolvers were
employed in a righteous cause. The tools were in the hands of one who
could use them. The same indignation that is said to have cleared the
temple once will clear it again. The question is not about the weapon,
but the spirit in which you use it." But the most farcical case of false
genealogy has to be the way Nelson Mandela, the founder of the
armed-struggle organization of the ANC, was turned into a global icon of
peace. He lays it out himself: "I said that [the time for passive
resistance had ended, that nonviolence was a useless strategy and could
never overturn a white minority regime bent on retaining its power at
any cost.]{.underline} At the end of the day, I said, violence was the
only weapon that would destroy apartheid and we must be prepared, in the
near future, to use that weapon. [The crowd was excited; the youth in
particular were clapping and cheering. They were ready to act on what I
said right then and there. At that point I began to sing a freedom song,
the lyrics of which say, '**There are the enemies, let us take our
weapons and attack them**.' I sang this song and the crowd joined in,
and when the song was finished, I pointed to the police and said,
'There, there are our enemies!"\' **Decades of pacification of the
masses and mas-sification of fears have made pacifism the spontaneous
political consciousness of the citizen**.]{.underline} With every
movement that develops now one has to grapple with this awful state of
affairs. One can cite the pacifists delivering black-clad rioters over
to the police at the Plaqa Cataluya in 2011, or the harassment and
verbal lynching of "Black Bloc" protesters by the same in Genoa in 2001.
In response to that, [the revolutionary milieus secreted, as a kind
antibody, the figure of the radical---someone who always takes the
opposing view to the citizen. To the moral proscription of violence by
the one, the other always replies with his purely ideological apology of
violence. **Where the pacifist always seeks to absolve himself of the
state of the world, to remain good by doing no evil, the radical seeks
to absolve himself of participation in the "existing state of things"
through minor illegalities embellished with hardcore "position
statements." Both aspire to purity, one through violent action, the
other by abstaining from it**. Each is the other's nightmare. It's not
certain that these two figures would go on existing for long if each one
didn't have the other deep inside him. As if the radical only lived to
make the pacifist shudder inside, and vice versa.]{.underline} It's
fitting that the bible of American citizen struggles since the 1970's is
titled Rules for Radicals---by Saul Alinsky. Because pacifists and
radicals are joined together in the same refusal of the world. They take
pleasure in their disjunction from every situation. It gets them high,
makes them feel like they're in touch with some sort of excellence. They
prefer living as extraterrestrials--- such is the comfort that is
authorized, for a while still, by life in the metropolis, their
privileged biotope. Since the catastrophic defeat of the 1970's, the
moral question of radicality has gradually replaced the strategic
question of revolution. That is, revolution has suffered the same fate
as everything else in those decades: it has been privatized. [It has
become an opportunity for personal validation, with radicality as the
standard of evaluation. "Revolutionary" acts are no longer appraised in
terms of the situation in which they are embedded, the possibilities
they open up or close. What happens instead is that a form is extracted
from each one of them. A particular sabotage, occurring at a particular
moment, for a particular reason, becomes simply a sabotage. And the
sabotage quietly takes its place among certified revolutionary practices
on a scale where throwing a Molotov cocktail ranks higher than throwing
rocks, but lower than kneecapping, which itself is not worth as much as
a bomb]{.underline}. The problem is that no form of action is
revolutionary in itself: sabotage has also been practiced by reformists
and by Nazis. [A movement's degree of "violence" is not indicative of
its revolutionary determination. The "radicality" of a demonstration
isn't measured by the number of shop windows broken. Or if it is, then
the "radicality" criterion should be left to those in the habit of
measuring political phenomena and ranking them on their skeletal moral
scale. Anyone who begins to frequent radical milieus is immediately
struck by the gap between their discourse and their practice, between
their ambitions and their isolation. It seems as if they were dedicated
to a kind of constant self-incapacitation.]{.underline} One soon
understands that they're not engaged in constructing a real
revolutionary force, but in a quest for radicality that is sufficient in
itself--- and is played out equally well on the terrain of direct
action, feminism or ecology. The petty terror that reigns there and
makes everyone so stiff is not that of the Bolshevik Party. It's more
like that of fashion, that terror which no one exerts in person, but
which affects everyone alike. In these milieus, one is afraid of not
being radical anymore, just as elsewhere one fears not being
fashionable, cool or hip. It doesn't take much to spoil a reputation.
One avoids going to the root of things in favor of a superficial
consumption of theories, demos, and relations. The fierce competition
between groups and inside them causes them to periodically implode. But
there's always fresh, young, and abused flesh to make up for the
departure of the exhausted, the damaged, the disgusted, and the
emptied-out. An a posteriori bewilderment overtakes the person who's
deserted these circles: how can anyone submit to such a mutilating
pressure for such enigmatic stakes? It's approximately the same kind of
bewilderment that must take hold of any overworked ex-manager turned
baker when he looks back on his previous life. The isolation of these
milieus is structural: between them and the world they've interposed
radicality as a standard. They don't perceive phenomena anymore, just
their measure. At a certain point in the autophagy, some will compete
for most radical by critiquing the milieu itself, which won't make the
slightest dent in its structure. "It seems to us that what really
reduces our freedom," wrote Malatesta, "and makes intiative impossible,
is disempowering isolation." This being the case, that [a fraction of
the anarchists declare themselves "nihilists" is only logical: nihilism
is the incapacity to believe in what one does believe in---in our
context, revolution. Besides, there are no nihilists, there are only
powerless individuals. The radical defining himself as a producer of
actions and discourses has ended up fabricating a purely quantitative
idea of revolution---as a kind of crisis of overproduction of acts of
individual revolt.]{.underline} "Let's not lose sight of the fact,"
wrote Emile Henry back then already, "that revolution will not be the
resultant of all these particular revolts." History is there to
contradict that thesis: whether it's the French, Russian, or Tunisian
revolution, in every instance revolution results from the shock
encounter between a particular act---the storming of a prison, a
military defeat, the suicide of a mobile fruit vendor---and the general
situation, and not the arithmetical addition of separate acts of revolt.
[Meanwhile, that absurd definition of revolution is doing its
foreseeable damage: one wears oneself out in an activism that leads
nowhere, one devotes oneself to a dreadful cult of performance where
it's a matter of actualizing one's radical identity at every moment,
here and now--- in a demo, in love, or in discourse. This lasts for a
time---the time of a burnout, depression, or repression. And one hasn't
changed anything. A gesture is revolutionary not by its own content but
by the sequence of effects it engenders. The situation is what
determines the meaning of the act, not the intention of its
authors.]{.underline} Sun Tzu said that "victory must be demanded of the
situation." Every situation is composite, traversed by lines of force,
tensions, explicit or latent conflicts. Engaging with the war that is
present, acting strategically, requires that we start from an openness
to the situation, that we undersand its inner dynamic, the relations of
force that configure it, the polarities that give it its dynamism. [An
action is revolutionary or not depending on the meaning it acquires from
contact with the world. Throwing a rock is never just "rock-throwing."
It can freeze a situation or set off an intifada. The idea that a
struggle can be "radicalized" by injecting a whole passel of allegedly
radical practices and discourses into it is the politics of an
extraterrestrial. A movement lives only through a series of shifts that
it effects over time. So at every moment there is a certain distance
between its present state and its potential.]{.underline} If it stops
developing, if it leaves its potential unrealized, it dies. A decisive
act is one that is a notch ahead of the movement's state, and which,
breaking with the status quo, gives it access to its own potential. This
act can be that of occupying, smashing, attacking, or simply speaking
truthfully. [The state of the movement is what decides. A thing is
revolutionary that actually causes revolutions. While this can only be
determined after the event, a certain sensitivity to the situation plus
a dose of historical knowledge helps one intuit the matter]{.underline}.
Let's leave the radicality worry to the depressives, the Young-Girls,
and the losers, then. The real question for revolutionaries is how to
make the lively powers in which one participates increase, how to
nurture the revolutionizing developments so as to arrive finally at a
revolutionary situation.

#### Human rights relies on a fantasy of an untouched whole body, a subject to be incorporated to within the regime of rights and western progress- this investment in salvation of bodies relies on a perpetual image of the salvageable body, an image that relies on the destruction of the body of the Other and the fantasy of the exposed Other.

When we [imagine a body we imagine it whole, but]{.underline}, in fact,
[it is always in pieces]{.underline}: pieces that are imagined held
together in the image of a person before the law, or pieces that break
apart in the image of the person who is outside this law. [The person
who recognises themselves before liberal law]{.underline}, we contend in
this paper, [references the images of those who are to become before
law:]{.underline} savages, barbarians, children, animals. [These
categories frame the images of the body in pieces]{.underline}, [waiting
in the wings of a liberal imagination of the subject, recruited for the
purposes of holding forth a difference; one which suggests pending
prohibition which will in turn result in a body in pieces]{.underline}.
These [pieces are the people who are not yet.]{.underline} These are the
[people who will become the subject who is a product of
progress]{.underline}. These are people who frame the image of what
should be, and what can be, before liberal law. The lessons of
postcolonial thinkers have taught us well that the subject of the
barbaric lands exists amongst us to form us, to define us, to allow our
imagination of ourselves. [This is the West's history of
modernity]{.underline}, so successfully framed by Edward Said and then
recounted in the works of Saba Mahmood, Chandra Talpade Mohanty and
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, to name a few. Here, we will revisit some of
the logics on the productions of Western subjectivity, through an
analysis of more recent policies of colonialism and images presented to
support a colonial imaginary. [Both policy and image are informed by the
colonial logics of the past.]{.underline} These are [policies that are
so unchanged and so insistently determined to prohibit practices of the
East]{.underline}; practices such as so-called 'female genital
mutilation' and the veiling of women.3 These [prohibitions on practices
of the East]{.underline}, we suggest, are not simply the product of the
legacies of colonial imaginations --- although they are certainly that
--- but [are the projections of an imagination of a fully authorising
subject.]{.underline} This [subject draws on the fantasy of its
completion at the 'end of history' in the gaze of human rights employing
the unified flesh of the body enshrined in human rights rhetoric to
initialise a fantasy]{.underline}; a [fantasy that has its investments
in the promise of the body as exposed and untouched by culture or,
indeed, by the prohibitions of law]{.underline}. Here, we take this
investment further and consider how [the **imagination of this body
relies on the destruction of the Other's body**.]{.underline} This
destruction is dutifully represented --- in law, public policy and media
--- as salvation, as unveiling or as preventing mutilation. But, we
suggest, the [**subject gazing on the images** of veiled women and
mutilated children **is harbouring an investment in their
absence,**]{.underline} an [investment]{.underline}, we suggest, [that
is as aggressive as that embodied in the audiences of torture, hanging
and dismemberment in the squares of pre-seventeenth-century
Europe]{.underline}. Here, we suggest that the [images that
circulate]{.underline} --- of mutilated children and veiled women ---
[present an imagination of not only the fully authorising Body that
could 'be' beneath the veil, or beyond the knife, but of another's body
which could be,]{.underline} and we suggest is represented as what
should be, [**broken into pieces to the point of
disintegration**.]{.underline} These are the [bodies presented in
theories of postcolonialism]{.underline}, but, to borrow and reinvest
Hannah Arendt's terminology, in 'modern times' (or here post9/11),
[these are bodies whose supposed salvation promotes violence towards
other cultures]{.underline}, [specifically those represented as Islamic
and/or Middle-Eastern]{.underline}.4 [These are the bodies to be saved,
which are also bodies which demand that the other is broken into
pieces]{.underline}.

#### Representations of violence against women reproduce patriarchal arrangements- multiple media tropes implicated in the 1AC's performativity, including the round-by-round "Rediscovery" of violence against women, treat it as a problem only for particular classes and blame victims for trauma.

disparate framing of femicides in Hawai'i.\" Radical Criminology 3

\*\*NOTE: VAW= Violence against women\*\*

Critics have long pointed out that media representations of crime are
unrealistic, giving the public a distorted impression of crime in
Western society (Best 1990; Hall et al. 1978; Mason 2006; Sacco 1995;
Surette 2007). Feminist scholars have echoed such concerns, pointing out
flaws in press coverage of VAW in particular (Benedict 1993, 1993;
Bullock and Cubert 2002; Dragiewicz 2011; Kozol 1995; Meyers 1994;
Schwartz and DeKeseredy 1993; Stanko 2000; Taylor 2009; Websdale and
Alvarez 1998). Such flawed coverage hides the pervasiveness and patterns
of VAW, under-problematizing it. Thus, [since VAW is a pillar of
patriarchy,]{.underline} whether intentionally or not,
[media]{.underline} support and [reproduce patriarchal
arrangements]{.underline} (Dragiewicz 2011; Meyers 1994; Ogle and Batton
2009; Walby 1989; Websdale and Alvarez 1998). Prior to the 1970s, media
ignored domestic violence, treating it as a private matter (Kozol 1995).
Today, they have moved beyond such ignorance, reporting on it. However,
news reports continue [to cover VAW in a partial and decontextualized
manner]{.underline}. Howe (1997) contends the media **[repeatedly
'rediscover' VAW, treating is as a novel, rather than a historically
persistent, phenomenon]{.underline}**. Press reports often ignore the
prevalence of rape and domestic violence, failing to contextualize these
acts as a serious social problem (Benedict 1993; Meyers 1994; Richards,
Gillespie, and Smith 2011). This is manifest in at least two clear
patterns. First, the [occurrence of this violence throughout various
strata of society is rarely acknowledged]{.underline}; instead press
reports **[present VAW as if it is located largely in a marginalized
underclass]{.underline}** (Grover and Soothill 1996; Websdale and
Alvarez 1998). Second, the [press often ignores patterns of escalation
in]{.underline} wife and partner [abuse]{.underline} (Bullock and Cubert
2002; Websdale and Alvarez 1998). Such **[abuse is generally covered
only when it is fatal]{.underline}** (or nearly so); such **[fatalities
are presented as stand-alone incidents]{.underline}**, rather than the
crescendo of escalating violence. Media coverage often
[blames]{.underline} raped and battered [women for their own
victimhood]{.underline}, [while excusing some men for their
crimes]{.underline} (Benedict 1993; Bullock and Cubert 2002; Meyers
1994; Taylor 2009; Websdale and Alvarez 1998). Victim-blaming themes
include questioning the victim's choice of clothing; supposedly
flirtatious behavior and/or sexual history; or emphasizing a victim's
reluctance to leave an abuser, among other themes (Benedict 1993; Taylor
2009). As Benedict (1993) points out, one might say the media construct
a dichotomy among sex victims, between virgins and vamps---chaste,
innocent victims who accord with hegemonic assumptions about female
behavior and identity; and lascivious and/or rebellious women who
deserve what they get. More generally, some scholars have pointed out
that [media representations construct worthy and unworthy female
victims]{.underline} (Chancer 1994; Meyers 1994; Schwartz and DeKeseredy
1993). This [worthiness is both determined by the victim's identity and
behavior and that of her attacker]{.underline}. [Powerful]{.underline}
[and privileged men's status generally mitigates their culpability in
media coverage]{.underline} (Benedict 1993; Meyers 1994). News often
frames VAW committed by powerful men as the result of factors beyond
offenders' control, such as mental illness or substance abuse (Richards,
Gillespie, and Smith 2011; Taylor 2009; Websdale and Alvarez 1998).
Postmurder suicides (or attempts) by offenders also often lead to
offender-sympathetic coverage. These murder-suicides are often framed by
reports as mutual tragedies, rather than acts of domestic violence
(Websdale and Alvarez 1998). Taylor (2009) conceptualizes victim
maligning and sympathy for offenders as direct and indirect blaming,
respectively. Direct blaming impugns the victim. Indirect blaming
essentially sympathizes with the offender, deflecting attention from the
victim's suffering. Even the press' reporting techniques limit
recognition and understanding of VAW. For example, terms like 'domestic
violence' or 'partner violence' conceal the fact that this is
overwhelmingly abuse of women by men (Dragiewicz 2011; Meyers 1994;
Websdale and Alvarez 1998). Furthermore, the common use of passive voice
can limit press construction of violence. For example, Henley, Miller,
and Beazley (1995) found that media reports of VAW often use passive
voice, which causes readers to ascribe less harm to these crimes.
Additionally, reporters often focus on minute details of cases, such as
gun calibres or wound descriptions, which tell the reader very little
about VAW as a social problem (Bullock and Cubert 2002; Websdale and
Alvarez 1998). Websdale and Alvarez (1998) call this 'forensic
reporting,' while Bullock and Cubert (2002) call it the 'police frame.'
Ultimately, this mode of reporting focuses readers' attention on the
details of specific cases, while obscuring thematic patterns of VAW. In
sum, many scholars argue, the above-mentioned patterns of coverage
amount to support for and reproduction of patriarchy on the part of
media (Dragiewicz 2011; Meyers 1994; Websdale and Alvarez 1998). [By
ignoring and/or limiting public understanding of a pillar of
patriarchy]{.underline} (VAW), the [media ensure that this social
problem will be under-addressed and patriarchal conditions will
persist]{.underline} (Walby 1989).

#### Human rights symbolically compensate for the inability of the complete subject by attempting to make the Other visible- the fantasy of a previously whole Other runs through human rights narratives of improvement and progress, engaging in a death driven politic that frustrates and causes lashout and erasure of the Other.

Both the [images narrate the historical and material becoming of bodies
on a linear plane]{.underline}, with each frame supposedly [marking
progress from tradition to modernity]{.underline}, or [rather marking
our identification, as a communal disapproval, when they do not
progress. Ours is supposedly not a modernity to which these women and
children are privy. The camera darkens, the bodies disappear, because
the West has lost sight of them.]{.underline} They disappear, not
because we cannot see them but because [their bodies are no longer
reflected]{.underline} for us, or more specifically, [in
us]{.underline}. Like a shattered mirror, the [images of veiled and
mutilated bodies are]{.underline} a [specular failure of an imagined
uniformity]{.underline}; [bodies marked with impossibility]{.underline}
as broken bodily pieces needing assembling and seeking meaning beyond
the descending veil. [For Al-Mutawakel's Western audience, as for
Manresa and Ramos-Rioja's --- whose exposure of Orientalist and
Islamophobic tropes in a political climate are shadowed by 'The Muslim
Question' --- the images can be read as extolling the virtues of
unveiling the body as part of a fantasy that generates ideas of freedom
as a complete acquisition of rights.]{.underline}25 Rights are the
pieces put together to form the fully authorising legal subject, or in
Douzinas' terms, '**[human rights break down the body into functions and
parts and replace its unity with rights']{.underline}**.26 [Rights, and
their fulfilment, are the tropes that accompany exposed flesh and the
practices of the prohibitions by the right law.]{.underline} This
[notion of history and nature in motion is encapsulated in the image of
unveiling]{.underline} --- like McClintock's panoptic time as world
history progressively evolving --- and such [images have historically
presaged and announced a desire for modernity as a desire for the modern
subject to be free from prohibition.]{.underline}27 Or, in Douzinas'
terms --- applying ideas of the Lacanian subject --- '\[[rights\]
symbolically compensate for the denied and barred bodily
wholeness]{.underline}.'28 [Embedded in Western modernity's imaginary of
unveiling is a desire of continued disclosure, a seeking out of an
unveiled perfect and impossible truth: the authentic universal human.
This (universal) human is supposedly exposed as a body because it is in
this form that we can see her spectacularised as the absence of
prohibition.]{.underline} The free child --- before it is cut by culture
--- is also the free woman imagined beneath the veil and visa versa. The
promise of the unveiled woman is what we will find beneath the veil,
like the child untouched (uncut). These [images demand Western viewers
to gaze on the promise as well as the possibility of a sovereign power
that can and would cut up the body if the correct allegiance is not
offered; a power which holds the supernatural qualities of the kings of
old; a power that can also produce the body as whole; as supposedly put
together through the mortar of rights and recognition.]{.underline}

#### Law is a libidinal investment in the making whole of bodies- the protection of the body from a looming harm that is embodied in images of spectacularized violence against bodies already presumed whole. The images presume a complete subject before violence and seeks to assimilate that into the Self- the need to liberate that subject from violence justifies death.

[Law]{.underline}, and its acceptance in the polis[, is always a product
of an image of violence]{.underline}.8 [Imperatives and acceptances of
criminal law always rely on investments in the prohibition of a practice
which is defined by fear and fragility, and presented in an image.
Someone must be protected, something must be prevented]{.underline}.
[The thing which must be prevented is]{.underline}, of course, in the
vein of John Stuart Mill, [a harm which is looming]{.underline}.9 The
[images]{.underline} we discuss, however, [problematise any pretence to
an easy recognition of what a harm is,]{.underline} [what it constitutes
and what a human is before that harm.]{.underline} But they go further.
Images of the veil and of female genital mutilation offer a constitutive
image of what the body is before and after it is prohibited. That body
is the make up of the flesh concealed and revealed, and the piece
removed and replaced. These are the bodies before colonial legal
practices that have constituted an East and a West, but they are bodies
now represented as quartered and cut by the tools of the East; quartered
and then offered on display, if you like. [These are bodies
spectacularised as a warning of what could come]{.underline}, [and they
are animated as what has been]{.underline}. These are
[bodies]{.underline}, which [hold]{.underline} not only [the promise of
what the subject of liberal law could be]{.underline}, and particularly
[that enshrined in the natural law rhetoric of human rights
law]{.underline}, but also what should be done in their name. In this
article we look at several images which offer bodies in pieces and we
consider their presentation to a Western audience. We particularly want
to examine how the images of veiled and circumcised (presented as
'mutilated') children and women, are offered to a Western audience in
spectacular fashion. That is, we will examine what the act of showing
demands, and what [the emphasis on that which cannot be
shown]{.underline} --- that which is beneath the veil --- [evokes as
fantasy]{.underline}. In this article we contend that the body beneath
the veil and [the body before 'mutilation' is imagined whole in the vein
of a teleological account of natural law]{.underline}, specifically that
of Costas Douzinas.10 This account, we suggest, [presents a body before
it is cut into pieces as a child that will become whole if only it is
left alone by the prohibitive forces of other laws]{.underline}, the law
of other sovereigns. We then take Eric Santner's discussion of the flesh
of the body and consider the animation quality of the images as they
offer its breaking apart, and [the investment in these images presenting
the pieces animated]{.underline} to the point of absence; [to the point
of destruction]{.underline}.11 To begin with, we consider several
[images which present the body as unveiled]{.underline}, or rather as
being veiled as a rationale for unveiling, and the child body as in a
state of pending and post mutilation. We consider these images, in their
partial representation of bodies, [as spectacles of sovereign
power]{.underline}. We then discuss [the use of the body in
these]{.underline} images and how it fixes an idea of natural law that
articulates with Lacan's consideration of Woman. We contend, in the vein
of Kalpana Sheshadri-Crooks and her analysis of Race, that the body
represented with mutilation or without the veil offers a site of the
transcendental and thereby of non-contestation.12 [The body is thus a
signified whole in image and in idea]{.underline}. [Like the child, the
body is always whole and functions as a subject in the process of
becoming]{.underline}. This work is part of a broader investigation into
what is it about the image of flesh removed and disappearing that has
been imbued with a progressive politics.13 We ask, why is the removal of
the veil, the naked body and the integrity of the flesh so important in
the historical and contemporary policy emanating from a colonial past?
Or, specifically, why does flesh equal freedom? But, here, we take this
analysis toward a psychoanalytic understanding of why
[freedom]{.underline} --- presented as so crucial to the politics of the
Middle East --- [seems to justify so much death.]{.underline}

#### Human rights presume the untouched previous body of the other is restorable and able to be incorporated into the schematic of western progress- this valorized flesh of the other is seen as an object that must be restored, via complete mastery- to serve western progress and complete cohesion of the subject.

valorised]{.underline} (unveiled and unmutilated) [flesh is mobilised in

perfect truth]{.underline}, [embodied in the not-yet-wholly-human, but
imagined as the promise of The Body]{.underline}. The Body as site of
fact and The Body as lived experience. The Body is what appears outside
the frame of the spectacle when presented with the animations of the
veiled and the mutilated. And this is what would be achieved with
unveiling. We would see The Body. The use of images as animation to
stage this seeing is a technique which resonates with the use of the
body, as an object through which sovereign power can be exercised, in
the square. The [frames show the trajectory of possibility]{.underline},
but crucially --- [as a means of covering over the 'missing link' of
contemporary politics]{.underline} in which the flesh of the king no
longer functions as The Body --- the animation as unveiling shows The
Body outside the frame. The audience's body which is also the king's
body. A Body ideal, a body still whole.

#### The alternative is to reject the 1AC to traverse the fantasy of salvation- the performance of human rights as embodied in the 1AC relies on colonial fantasies of salvation- the alternative is to analyze these fantasies within the 1AC as a rejection of their death driven politic.

The guided tour of Ruhiira provides a highly misleading impression of
the success of the MVP. In the words of one health worker: 'When we get
visitors from donor countries -- now that is when you see Ruhiira
shining! But let them come another time...It is all about pleasing the
visitors. Then \[the visitors\] go back, and they revert to their normal
situation.' 64 Viewed from this perspective, the jubilant festivities
described above take on the appearance of a Brechtian farce, in which
the privileged and the destitute revel in their collective
dehumanisation. Jean Comaroff has conceptualised such [humanitarian
spectacles in terms of 'the politics of salvation']{.underline}. 65
There is clearly a religious dimension to the MVP. The very name
'Millennium Promise' is laden with religious overtones, and several
evangelical churches are partners of the organisation.66 But the
[staging of this spectacle is infused with]{.underline} a complex and
obscure [jouissance]{.underline}, which remains to be deciphered. For
Sachs and his wealthy associates [the source of enjoyment
is]{.underline} unambiguously [located in the performance of the
messianic role of the saviour.]{.underline} As Matthew Bishop has
argued, philanthrocapitalism is 'about making a difference with your
life, which is vaguely religious and gives you a buzz'. 67 But the
villagers also enjoy these performances, and this is more difficult to
explain. After all, why would you celebrate a development project that
you knew was failing you? I was struck by this question during an
interview with a poor mother of two in her early twenties, who lived in
a single-room hut on a steep slope about three kilometres from the
Project Office in Ruhiira. The woman was one of the singers who
entertained Sachs and other visiting dignitaries. She told me of various
ways that the MVP was failing to fulfil its promises to her. It had
stopped providing her with free seeds and fertiliser three years
previously, and she had returned to her prior farming methods. Cows,
goats, and latrines had been given to influential local people, but not
to her. She had not received any business training. She had been
excluded from the MVP's fuel-efficient cook-stove scheme because they
were selling the stoves at a price she could not afford (20,000
shillings -- \$8). The MVP had also started charging for the clean water
it provided (200 shillings -- 8 US cents -- for a jerry can). She could
not afford this either, and was using a polluted water source instead.68
Based on this account, I assumed that her only reason for participating
in the 'Millennium Band' would be in the hope of receiving payment for
her performance, and that her songs of thanks would have been insincere.
The band must have been cynically established by the MVP administrators
as part of their carefully orchestrated tour experience, I thought. But
things were not so straightforward. In interviews with this woman and
two of her fellow band members, I was told that they had created the
'Millennium Band' themselves, to thank 'white guests like Sachs' for
their generosity.69 They wrote their own songs in the local language
Runyankole, with lyrics like 'Jeffrey Sachs/You have done a lot/God
should bless you'. 70 Sometimes they received a little money as a tip,
but sometimes they did not, and this was not the objective of their
performances. Despite having told me of all the ways the MVP had failed
her, the woman smiled when talking about 'Sachsy', and told me that 'We
sing about how they have brought us development, how they have given us
clean water... It's true that they have given us everything. That is
what we sing about.' 71 The members of the Millennium Band were not
'docile bodies' produced by a governmental machine and blindly
performing their prescribed functions.72 On the contrary, as we have
seen, there was no effectively functioning governmental machine in
Ruhiira. Yet their knowledge of the MVP's failure did not prevent them
from enjoying its success. Once again, it is Lacan, rather than
Foucault, who can provide an explanation for this peculiar state of
affairs. In his exposition of the Lacanian theory of the subject, Žižek
likens human subjectivity to the digestive system of a plant, whose
intestines are 'outside its body' (in the sense that it is nourished by
absorbing nutrients through its roots). In the same way, Žižek argues,
[our dependence on language in the construction]{.underline} of our
worlds [of meaning implies that the roots from which we draw our
'spiritual food' are]{.underline} located outside ourselves, '[embodied
in the decentred symbolic order'.]{.underline} 73 For this reason [it is
not necessary to 'subjectively' believe in an ideology]{.underline} for
it to be operative, **[as long as this ideology is expressed in the
performance of a ritual]{.underline}**. In a church service, for
example, the belief in God can be operative without anyone actually
believing in Him: 'As Pascal put it, if you do not believe, kneel down,
act as if you believe, and belief will come by itself'. 74 The rituals
performed in Ruhiira function ideologically in precisely this way. The
visiting [dignitaries pretend to believe for the Western
consumers]{.underline} of their philanthrocapitalist initiatives. The
singing and dancing villagers pretend to believe for the visiting
dignitaries. And in their shared enjoyment of the uplifting music and
the messianic speeches, the success of the MVP becomes operative as an
objective faith, without anyone subjectively believing in it.75 In other
words, everyone collectively believes what they individually know to be
false. On a purely symbolic level the rituals performed in Ruhiira
present an illusory unity, in which donors and recipients confront each
other as equal partners, enjoying the shared success of a community-led
development project. As Sachs said to the villagers in the scene
described above, 'We haven't done it, you have'. But, beyond the
symbolic register, this [performance operates ideologically]{.underline}
not only by celebrating a false equality, but also **[by mobilising an
obscene enjoyment of the relations of global inequality that it at once
stages and disavows]{.underline}**. In Ruhiira the staging of the
relationship between the villagers and the visiting dignitaries
reproduces the sado-masochistic enjoyment of the colonial relation. On
one side, there is the '[narcissistic self-gratification' of the
colonial administrator]{.underline}.76 On the other, there is the
submissive deference to 'white guests like Sachs', who are presented to
the villagers as abstract figures of authority. A Millennium Band member
explained that she had been told that Sachs is 'the one behind
everything, the one who does everything'. 77 When I asked what he knew
about Tommy Hilfiger, a school teacher who had been present at one of
his visits said 'I don't know. I know that he is a Big Man. I know that
when he is to come, you see everyone moving up and down, doing what he's
supposed to do.' 78 The [fantasy space]{.underline} of the Millennium
Village [is]{.underline} therefore ultimately [sustained by]{.underline}
what Žižek describes as the '[paradoxical
jouissance]{.underline}...[that the exploited]{.underline}, the servant,
[receives for serving the Master']{.underline}. 79

### LINK -- Lack

#### The presentation of the mutilated body as something to be made whole is an investment in the fantasy of making whole- the fantasy of the future-whole body functions as a way of creating human rights as a Master discourse- the body as injured functions as an imagined universal experience of pain, death, injury for the subject for the viewer to imagine corporeality. This investment in understanding the Other body is doomed to fail as the body can never be the Ideal Whole Body because the body is not free of deterioration and desire

While human rights campaigns put to use the image in order to stage the
offer of freedom and rights, we assess here [the investment in
presenting the body as a body in pieces and always imagined as whole
beneath the veil and/or before the practices of another's law. It is
precisely the body that has become the site of knowledge production,
myth-making and specular support in the sustaining of the fantasy of a
whole subject before the law]{.underline}. The production of the images,
which [present the promise of a pre-cut body and the body almost always
already unveiled]{.underline}, [acts as support for human rights
allegiance]{.underline}, and such an allegiance offers the platform of
support for the existence[, in Lacanian parlance, of human rights to
function as a Master discourse; a discourse which gains its support
through the promise of the body as natural, as fact.29 The body imagined
as natural functions as a vehicle for imagining universal
experience]{.underline} --- **[pain, injury and death]{.underline}**.
[As such, its very presentation draws the imagination of the viewer, in
a mode of identification with the image, to a transcendental possibility
of the incontestable, of a signifier without pretender]{.underline}.
This is [the body's role in natural law, and it has become its role in a
human rights doctrine infused with the ideals of natural
law]{.underline}. Natural law, in Agamben's terms, posits a subject with
certain natural (and therefore universal) moral capacities, a natural
life (zoe) whose purpose was simply to fulfil its function in that
society. The bios (political life) was to build on zoe by inscribing
rights and duties on the body to reach its potential.30 Natural law
revealed the potential in everyone as part of a historical quest for the
universal. The body would become if allowed. For Douzinas, unlike myths
which rely on beginnings, 'reason' as a historical process and which
human rights is its legacy, looks to telos or ends.31 In this mode,
natural law has an anti-historicist claim that presents it as beyond the
law, beyond culture, a universalist Hegelian geist assisting individuals
in perfecting their nature, their full potential.32 [The law functions
here --- naturally --- to free the human to realise their free will, a
will which is tied to bodily integrity, or specifically the
uninterrupted will of the body to fulfil its natural
purpose.]{.underline} In modernity, with the perceived victory of
Western civilisation over ideology, an 'end of history' was declared
which would support the idea of body as universal fact if enshrined in
human rights. [Human rights, in their performance of natural law,
enabled the human to 'be'.]{.underline} History and civilisation had
reached the apotheosis of human development. It was only left to perfect
the rest of humanity with the tools of Western civilisation: liberalism,
democracy and human rights. Identifying the desire for coupling a
specific selfhood with freedom in the extolling of human rights today,
Alain Badiou contends, is a return to the abstract Kantian subject --- a
subject who can be used to measure all --- and indicative of a hegemonic
constitution of a Western-inspired universal human subject[. It is
within the teleology of the desire for reaching the potential of 'being'
--- as a production of the universal 'human' --- that the body appears
as the site of the universal, held aloft in the ideals of natural law
and embalmed as an ideal in the shrine of human rights
doctrine]{.underline}. Posed as universal, [The Body functions as a fact
through which the subject can identify itself as firstly inhabiting a
corporeal body that testifies to the reality of fact, and secondly, and
not mutually exclusively, as existing in a relation of knowing the
universal. The body itself offers this form of 'universal satisfaction'
--- as a form of satisfying any queries as to the authenticity of its
signification --- because of its affiliation and presentation in the
historical frame of natural law.]{.underline}33 In one contemporary
Australian example of this presumed knowing of the body, conservative
Australian Senator Jacqui Lambie argues publically on the importance of
banning the veil '\[b\]ecause what I believe is we must be able to tell
the body language and we can do that by the face'.34 [The notion of a
body being able to identify the truth of another body --- particularly
via the face --- is a commonsense idea that has persisted in modernity
across Western cultures]{.underline}. It is an idea well captured in
Anne Michael's quotation which opens this article. A body knows a body
precisely because the body retains a universal, factual knowledge, in
the mode of natural law. And the subject lives that knowing. Human
rights rhetoric then fixes this knowledge as a knowledge of the
universal, and as a universal Good, one which will broker no dissent.
[Through this fixing as fixation on the body, it comes to be attached,
manifested and aligned with, in Lacan's terms, the Master's
discourse]{.underline}.35 This discourse presents the body only as the
Good in its image as whole. The [pieces of the body removed or unseen
indicate the contestable]{.underline}, the uncertain or, in Lacan's
idiom, [as inhabiting the Real]{.underline}. [What cannot be seen ---
that behind the veil --- or what remains once the wholeness is
'mutilated', indicates a beyond to the whole signifying presence of the
natural body]{.underline}. Thus, [the body must maintain a visceral
integrity and a visibility in order to function as a whole. The body,
configured through human rights as that which must maintain a visceral
integrity, is located in the site of the Master's discourse, and holding
onto the body in its whole form, that is, in its natural form, fuses the
Master's discourse]{.underline} --- here [configured as human rights
doctrine --- with that of the visible flesh]{.underline}. This fusing is
performed in the mirror, or rather in the mirror image of the body
represented in images, such as the ones above. What we see in the
Al-Mutawakel image of the 'disappearing' woman and child is pieces cut
off, like that of Kadi, but pieces which hold a special significance.
[Indeed, the flesh concealed under the veil --- read through the
assertions of a human rights enthusiasm for an integrity of the whole
body --- becomes metonymic with the weighted significance of the
clitoris]{.underline}. Both are [that which keeps the body whole; pieces
that diachronically signify the body as whole if only it could
retain/expose those pieces]{.underline}.36 These [pieces can thus be
understood as forms of the Lacanian objet petit a. Specifically, they
are pieces that have no specular image]{.underline}; that is, [they
cannot be re-presented because they are a form of satisfying
presence]{.underline}.37 They are absolutely here, absolutely known. And
they are presented in these images as if 'we all' understand them in the
same way, we all have bodies and a body knows a body! Thus, [they unify
in the image, but they also show what it is to be unified]{.underline}.
The object petit a, as it circulates through these images, relates
specifically to the Lacanian notion of Woman (rather than women),
because the child and the woman beneath the veil --- both cut by the
violence of another's law --- hold the promise of the wholly signified
status of Woman.38 The body in the discourses of 'unveiling' and 'FGM'
functions like the Lacanian description of Woman insofar as it is Woman
who is imagined as exposable under the veil or before mutilation; a
[whole body is a body which is imagined to fully signify
Being.]{.underline} This is despite the existence of 'women' who, in the
lived world, can never fulfil their symbolisation as Woman --- much like
[**the body can never be The Body**. It is always someone's body with
its distinctions and degradations]{.underline}. It is far from a lived
experience of fact. [The body deteriorates, becomes ill and dies. It has
desires which cannot be satisfied, and are often prohibited. It is, as
with women (and men of course), subjected to the contestations of
signification and the confustications of time and uncertainty, including
the uncertainties of law.]{.underline} [When represented in pieces,
however, this reality is elided and other bodies come to represent the
possibility of The Body, if only they are unveiled or
uncut.]{.underline}

#### The universalized image of the Body reduces bodies to their rights- the body is only defined by the political rights and the lacking body. This globalized biopolitics of rearranging the lacking body to cover the lack of the Self that salvation promises to cover- this biopolitics emerges in geopolitical modes of imperial aggression, extrajudicial killings, and reaffirms the ability of the sovereign to maim bodies to prevent the maiming of the western body politic- the dualistic narratives of salvation and erasure function to animate the fantasy of covering the missing link

The stakes of [the need to represent the body as a site of the universal
and indeed as the site of, in Lacan's terms, the universal satisfaction
of the signifier]{.underline}, are not difficult to map in modernity and
particularly in a post-9/11 world. The [universalist claims of human
rights has not only framed the facticity of the body but, paradoxically,
has meant the reduction of bodies to their political
rights:]{.underline} [having them, accumulating more of them, lacking
them or being undeserving of them]{.underline}. [Bodies can thus have
rights, or not]{.underline}. And this both relieves and promotes
anxiety. Specifically, [the legalisation of human desire and the
authority that human rights has assumed in guiding the development of
humanity has also meant the 'naked human' is based on violent
exclusions]{.underline}, [revealing the reduction of the human to a
universal category subject to biopolitical mechanisms of state
power]{.underline}. Building on Foucault's notion of biopower --- the
surveilling and disciplinary technologies of the state to govern bodies
--- Agamben's contention is that **[human rights relies on docile
bodies]{.underline}**: the [politicising of the theological body that is
posited as lacking its nature]{.underline} and [thus put to use by
powerful disciplinary strategies to relocate it]{.underline}. Unlike
Foucault, who links biopower to modern forms of microgoverning that
require the destruction of the body, Agamben argues biopower can be
traced to Ancient Greece wherein the unwritten laws of nature come under
the fold of politics which sees the bios (political life) appropriate
zoe (natural life) and put it to use for the bios.46 In Santner's
reading, Agamben is precisely looking to the Schmittian sovereign
decision as a form which reduces bios to zoe with the [psychoanalytic
motivation of covering the 'missing link' introduced by
signification]{.underline}, or that is, [by castratio]{.underline}n.47
In accepting Santner's use of Kantorowicz --- which outlines the monarch
as having a fleshly body that experienced death and a transcendental
eternal body, and that today modern society is trying to secure the
latter --- then [the image of pieces of flesh has a special
place]{.underline}, and particularly the image of flesh in its status as
uncovered or animated as to-be-uncovered. As Santner says: In order [to
become a human subject]{.underline}, [the 'flesh-and-blood' of our
existence as animals --- even social animals --- must be supplemented by
a surplus of 'flesh']{.underline}: that is [the very stuff of a missing
link or gap]{.underline}.48 He contends that the surplus that results
from the missing gap has been democratised by migrating to the new
bearer of sovereignty, The People, who now struggle to secure the flesh
of sovereignty. The new bearers are 'in some sense stuck with an excess
of flesh' --- what he calls a 'surplus of immanence' that their own
bodies cannot fully embody and thus must be handled in other ways.49
This [surplus is handled in the gyrations of contemporary
politics]{.underline}; that is, [what cannot fully be closed upon is
arranged in order to quell the anxiety over this impossible
closure]{.underline}. The [effort toward closure is]{.underline}, in a
psychoanalytic sense, [an effort toward thwarting
castration.]{.underline} In a politico-legal sense, this is [an effort
to close upon the anxiety of the arbitrariness of the sovereign
decision]{.underline}.50 It is an effort [to deny the haunting presence
of the king that]{.underline} now exists in the uncertain rule of The
People, and [is embodied]{.underline}, [in]{.underline} contemporary
[Western politics, in]{.underline} the ascent of The People to
[decisions to torture, to detain without arrest, to kill without
trial.]{.underline} We suggest here that the very [images
of]{.underline} such [practices]{.underline} --- images of Guantanamo
Bay, of Obama surveying the assassination of Osama bin Laden and even
the cartoon like images of drone strikes --- [function alongside the
images of other bodies cut into pieces to assist in the legitimisation
of the aggression of contemporary sovereign decisions]{.underline}. Our
work here speaks particularly to the use of images and the staging of
The Body, to explain the acceptance of the 'decision/s'. That is, we
contend that the [images assist with the lack of resistance to
implementations]{.underline} and even [enthusiasms over]{.underline} the
newer, and more obvious, [practices of sovereign decision]{.underline}
--- [such as arbitrary detention, torture and assassinations **by
staging the stakes of the decision as the threat of Western bodies being
broken into pieces**]{.underline}. This dual appearance is not merely
coincidence and not only --- although it is certainly --- justification
for the torture, for the deaths, for the drone strikes.51 These [images
function in a mode of animation]{.underline}, [as a mode of the before
and after of The Body]{.underline}. They move, they progress, they
undress, and as such [they offer a mobile imagination to
the]{.underline} long-held [fantasies of Western domination over the
fragmented bodies of the East]{.underline}. Santner's reading of Agamben
becomes specifically relevant to the staging of the images of the veiled
woman and the imagination of The Body because [both the body of the
child uncut and the body imagined beneath the veil are imagined as human
rights congealed, and thus immune from the decision, as they are immune
from lack itself]{.underline}. The [staging of these images as
animation]{.underline} also [contributes to their form of relief
from]{.underline} the [anxieties of human rights
universalism]{.underline} [because animation]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} the world of the palimpsest where [what disappears
remains as an imprint in one's mind]{.underline}.52 The images of the
veiled woman, like that of the 'mutilated' child, as palimpsest, are the
promise of either a relief or a threat of what was before or after. Not
unique in the field of humanitarian aid, these [images employ the
techniques of 'before' and 'after']{.underline}, and the Al-Mutawakel
images, in particular, function almost like a cartoon, a 'flicker book'
--- if flicked over fast enough you can actually [watch the bodies of
the woman and child disappear]{.underline}. The book of Kadi is more
elaborate in its narration through images --- from non-mutilated to
mutilated --- but the result is effectively the same. We know what will
happen. The images however, unlike Death of Marat, indicate a trajectory
toward a time ahead and a time before. And, unlike the Death of Marat,
the location, which is the metamorphosis of the body into space in
Marat, is a metamorphosis into death. In the final black image of
Al-Mutawakel's picture we remember what was as what could have been,
forever. [This progressive/regressive animation]{.underline}, read
alongside ideas of the fact-quality of The Body, [functions to work upon
Santner's 'missing link' in the polis in a form that offers only full
presence to the absence]{.underline}. That is, [the body was there, and
when it is gone, it is all gone]{.underline}. Somewhat
counter-intuitively (or at least counter to commonsense) [this can be
read through psychoanalysis as an action of the death drive where
'tension is maintained at its lowest level' or as the most obvious form
of complete signification]{.underline}.53 **[Death is the only universal
possible]{.underline}** (although, of course, at the same time it is the
only experience that our bodies cannot know, even Jacqui Lambie cannot
know). Read from the other side of time, [the body that appears as the
child --- before the law --- is a body which formerly was a body fully
satisfied in its desires]{.underline}, a body in the womb; or, for
Lacan, the regression from childhood into pregnancy gestures to the past
of a body which is whole because the child/embryo is also the phallus.54
[The Child inside produces Woman]{.underline}. These are [represented
outside the frame, of course. But just as in McClintock's version of
'panoptical time' where the world is presented in the West through a
vision of global history]{.underline} '[consumed in a single spectacle
from a point of privileged invisibility', the world of The Body is
presented in these images as outside the frame, and what remains are the
pieces.]{.underline}55

### LINK -- Disfigurement

#### Disability and castration are inexplicably linked as fantasies of loss and disempowerment- the characterization of castration as a triumphant disempowerment of the White man implicitly recreates the narratives of dependency and loss that frame disability. Those dependency narratives reinforce narratives that the "home" of disability is constrained to the hospital and that disability is a "price paid" for failure to be normate

2017. pp.54-55 accessed 7-29-2019 //LFP

At issue here is the fact that [questions of gender, and specifically
the feminization of the male subject, have been grafted onto
disablement.]{.underline} In an attempt [to commentate on the broken
state of America after the loss in Vietnam, films like Coming Home and
Born on the Fourth of July deploy disability as a conduit through
which]{.underline} the [audience can experience the]{.underline} broader
[damage done to the nation]{.underline}, [but by deploying disability as
a means to talk about feminization and weakness, **disability is
validated as being correlated with fantasies of loss, emasculation, and
disempowerment**]{.underline}. In relation to the wounded soldier, this
[connection most often plays out as a castration]{.underline}, [with
disabled characters portrayed as]{.underline} [being both physically and
sexually]{.underline} [impotent]{.underline}. The binding of disability
and emasculation has had a profound impact on future stories about
disability, which have come to rely on this connection, correlating
issues of disablement with those of castration in which characters are
confronted with the question of whether they can still be men despite
being disabled. The answer is, almost always, "No." All three of these
war films follow a relatively similar trajectory when handling
disability which, when analyzed, reveal some of the powerful fantasies
of disability that are wrapped up within these texts. To start, all of
these texts begin by explicating the active and virile nature of the
male characters in an effort to amplify the tragedy that will befall
these men once they are wounded in Vietnam. This inevitably leads to
[the traumatic moment of breakage]{.underline}, when the soldier is
seriously wounded and appears to die. From this point on, things will
never be the same for these characters, as they begin their new lives as
disabled men within the comforting, controlling, but also terrifying,
walls of the medical establishment. A juxtaposition is presented in
which the soldier no longer fits at home, a home that is physically and
emotionally inaccessible after the accident. As a result, the veteran
comes to best ["belong" to the hospital system]{.underline}. The
[hospital becomes a place of cure]{.underline}, wholly focused on
reconstituting the body and reconstructing the identity in [an attempt
to]{.underline} fulfill the wish to once again [be
"normal]{.underline}." Eventually, these characters must return home,
but as feared, the [home has become]{.underline} a hostile and
[inhospitable]{.underline} place. Within [the walls of the
institution]{.underline}, [disability was normal]{.underline}, but
[outside]{.underline} [disability becomes a memorial
object]{.underline}: a tragic [reminder of what happened]{.underline}
overseas **[and the price]{.underline}** the nation has
**[paid]{.underline}**. The return home ultimately sets up the biggest
conflict within these texts -- the moment when the character is forced
to grapple with his newly constructed identities, a fight that turns on
whether he is still a man despite his disabilities. Throughout these
texts, there are powerful [fantasies of disability depicted]{.underline}
and it is these conflicts that [inform]{.underline} both the public's
[perception of disability]{.underline} [as well as future
representations]{.underline} of disability. First, and most obvious is
the [fantasy that to be disabled is a tragedy akin to
death]{.underline}. The idea here is that [to become disabled is to
encounter a fragmentation]{.underline} of not just the body but [of the
self]{.underline}. This fragmentation [gives rise to a desire to
reconstitute the body]{.underline}, and by extension, the former self --
[to put the pieces back together]{.underline}. But even more insidious
is [the fantasy that disability is a form of castration,]{.underline}
both literal and figurative. For all of these texts, **[to become
disabled is to lose one's manhood]{.underline}**, which is [symbolized
through the]{.underline} phallic sexual [impotence]{.underline} that
befalls all of the physically disabled characters. The castration
suffered by these characters goes deeper than just the use of the penis,
marking the disabled subject as lacking the phallus entirely. [The
disempowered bodies are confined by their medical equipment and
dependent on others]{.underline} in order to survive. In this way, [the
wound of disability is one that returns]{.underline} these men [to a
particular state of childhood]{.underline}, indeed to the crises of the
Oedipal complex, [where the limits of their abilities and desires are
tested and they find themselves lacking.]{.underline}

#### Castration as disempowering marks a confrontation with the anxiety of disability that generates the anxiety of the normate subject surrounding disability- the precarity of the self is embodied in the disabled person, a literal representation of the "worse than death" that disability represents. These anxieties are centered on the fear that bodies and the wholeness of the body is a crucial point of identity.

Ultimately, this project attempts to interrogate media text as being
analogous to [the confrontation of the normate and the
disabled]{.underline}, a moment Julia Kristeva explains [causes a
narcissistic identity wound upon the normate as they are forced to
interrogate their own inherent vulnerability]{.underline} (Kristeva
2010). In producing stories about disability, the normate producer
confronts their own potential disablement, forced to imagine what life
would be like if they were disabled. As such, [representations of
disability are the manifestations of this confrontation]{.underline},
with the texts [revealing the core anxieties and fantasies lurking below
the surface of these encounters]{.underline}. This study applies this
psychoanalytic lens across film and television, following how the
fantasy of male physical disablement has been informed by and evolves
from past presentations. The texts studied here reveal [the
confrontation with a castration threat,]{.underline} with the
[stories]{.underline} grounded in terrifying anxiety and comforting
fantasy, [informed by and conforming to the medical model of
disability]{.underline}. The **[specter of castration appears to haunt
the disabled male figure]{.underline}**, [literally and
metaphorically]{.underline}, deeply influencing the development and
deployment of disabled male characters in popular media. One of the core
[anxieties present when confronting disability within these texts is the
connection between disability and death]{.underline}. In fact, death is
imagined as a preferred outcome to trauma rather than surviving with a
disability. This [anxiety is centered on the fear that when bodies are
broken an individual's identity is shattered as well]{.underline}, as
the person is no longer capable of performing identity-forming tasks,
like playing sports, in the same way after an injury. When an identity
is built around ideas of strength and physical activity, the [moment of
disability marks the death of this]{.underline} previous
[self]{.underline} and requires a new identity to be constructed around
actions and behaviors believed to be polar opposite in nature. In this
way, it is feared that a person will fundamentally change when they
become disabled, leaving them not just to mourn the loss of their
previous physical or intellectual ability, but of their core identity.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the war films studied, which
actively construct the main characters as being hyper-masculine,
athletic, and independent individuals before the war who are feminized
by the trauma done to them in Vietnam. Fear of disability being akin to
death, and the desire for death over disability, is also present in both
Degrassi and Glee, where Jimmy and Artie must come to terms with the
death of their past self after becoming disabled. [The anxiety of losing
one's sense of self]{.underline}, the death of our identity, [is
mediated by]{.underline} the [fantasy]{.underline} of cure. Throughout
all of these texts there is a burning desire to resurrect the body,
particularly in Degrassi and Glee, reclaiming the old self through
medical and technological advancement. The most optimistic of these
texts is certainly Degrassi, which finalizes the Jimmy storyline with an
ambiguous promise of "stem cell surgery" that is helping both Jimmy and
Trina to overcome their spinal cord injuries. Also based more in science
fiction than science fact, Glee takes an optimistic view of Artie's
ability to overcome, implying that it is just a matter of time before
medical science or technological adaptation provide Artie that which he
dreams of constantly -- the ability to walk again. In this way, cure is
validated as the most desired outcome to disability. But [tied to this
fantasy]{.underline} of cure **[is the anxiety that what is broken will
never be put back together]{.underline}**. Lurking behind the veneer of
optimism throughout all of these texts is a cold reality that all of
these characters will likely remain in wheelchairs for the rest of their
lives, no matter how hard they attempt to transcend their limitations.
The result of this anxiety is a series of emotionally crushing scenes in
which all five main disabled characters struggle through physical
therapy to walk again, only to fail and realize that their effort is in
vain. This anxiety is the most powerful and hurtful to our narcissistic
sense of self because it validates the fear that no matter how hard we
try there are obstacles in this world that are insurmountable and, in
that way, we are all fundamentally flawed creatures who will never live
up to our ego ideal. The [anxiety of permanent disrepair is tackled
through a fantasy of justified suffering]{.underline} -- a belief [that
there can be significance]{.underline} to life with a disability [that
makes the suffering manageable]{.underline}. For Ron Kovic, disability
is fantasized to have added complexity to his character, converting him
from a mindless servant of the state into a radical citizen fighting for
post- Vietnam justice in America. As Ron suffers for his sins, his
wheelchair becomes a symbol of memorial, a reminder of past
transgressions that serves to warn against making the same mistakes
again. Similarly, Glee fantasizes that without Artie suffering the
indignities of disability none of the good things that have happened at
McKinley High would have been possible. In this way, Artie is cast as a
martyr who suffers through his disability and, in doing so, inspires his
fellow classmates to overcome the barriers preventing them from
achieving greatness -- if Artie can live with a disability, there is no
limit to what the able-bodied members of Glee club can achieve. This
fantasy conforms to the much-theorized stereotype of the "super-crip,"
the disabled individual who struggles against their limitations and, in
doing so, minimizes and makes manageable the petty obstacles facing the
normate public in their dayto- day lives. At the same time, while
disability is glamorized as being a socially useful suffering, [all of
the anxieties present when confronting disability are rooted in the
belief that the disabled subject is a castrated subject who has suffered
a profound, disempowering loss]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, worse
still, [that everyone is susceptible to this same violence]{.underline}.
In all of these texts, [characters with disabilities are presented
as]{.underline} being fundamentally crippled by their inability,
**[individuals who are incomplete and, therefore, perpetually
dependent]{.underline}**. [The disabled body is marked]{.underline},
literally and figuratively, [by terrible corporeal loss]{.underline}
that is so profound we attempt to make sense of it through a similarly
charged anxiety -- the loss of the phallus. Although Lacan argues that
the penis is not the phallus but merely symbolic of it, to represent
this loss, **[disability is inherently tied up in fears of literal
castration]{.underline}**, [the wholesale loss of sexual
potency]{.underline} and the inability to have penetrative sexual
intercourse. Rather than mourning the loss of physical ability, this
anxiety is substituted, with all five male disabled characters' central
fear involving the loss of their penis. For this reason, [men with
physical disabilities are marked as castrated individuals]{.underline}
whose very manhood comes into question as penile intercourse is
determined to be an important signifier of heterosexual masculinity.
Worse still, the anxiety is that to encounter these castrated men is to
risk castration, like a boy apprehending a naked female for the first
time.

### LINK -- Femicide

#### Femicide discourses ignore complex power dynamics in favor of simplistic narratives- they employ racialized markers to "Other" groups based on existing hierarchies.

North Carolina Wilmington) \"Heinous crime or acceptable violence? The
disparate framing of femicides in Hawai'i.\" Radical Criminology 3
(2014). pp.13-14 accessed 7-29-2019 //LFP

Violence against women is a pervasive social problem, yet it is
under-reported in the press. Scholars have long critiqued media for
flawed coverage of this crime. Yet, few studies have specifically
examined femicides using an intersectional framework. This study does
that, examining femicide coverage in Hawaii's two major dailies---The
Honolulu Advertiser and Star-Bulletin ---between 2000 and 2008. Findings
indicate that Hawaii's newspapers [frame femicides
disparately]{.underline}---as an unacceptable social problem, or as
routine, acceptable violence. This disparate framing is accomplished
[through the clustering of patriarchal, racialized, and class-based
discourses]{.underline}. Considering Hawaii's distinct racial/ethnic
diversity, [racialized discourses]{.underline} in this sample were
particularly thought provoking, [employing insidious and nuanced
racialized markers to 'other' various groups]{.underline}. Findings
regarding these racialized discourses may be generalizable to analyses
of 'post-racial' discourse on an increasingly diverse mainland.
Femicides are one of the most troubling, and common, forms of homicide
in Hawaii. Yet, Hawaii's press largely fails to communicate this
significance. They sometimes cover femicides defensibly, problematizing
this crime and humanizing victims. Unfortunately, such coverage is
exceptional. In this article, I discuss how [coverage tends to
employ]{.underline} two disparate frames for femicides---one, the
'social problem' frame, cultivates sympathy for the victim, gives some
context, and problematizes domestic violence. The other (and more
common), the 'acceptable violence' frame, does the near opposite,
reporting in a routinized, simplistic manner. These frames are built
upon [clustered and intersecting patriarchal, racialized, and
class-based discourses]{.underline}. Thus, **[they provide the illusion
of problematizing domestic violence but actually work to perpetuate
existing hierarchies built upon class, race, and gender
divisions]{.underline}**. For decades, scholars have pointed out that
media representations of crime exaggerate crimes committed by the poor
and marginalized, and often minimalize the crimes of the wealthy and
white (Chiricos and Eschholz 2002; Gilliam and Iyengar 2000; Grover and
Soothill 1996; Hall et al. 1978; Herman and Chomsky 2002; Mason 2006;
McMullan 2006). Feminist scholars have added to this discussion,
pointing out that [news on violence]{.underline} [against
women]{.underline} (VAW) is particularly troubling because it [conceals
the pervasiveness and patriarchal roots of this violence]{.underline}
(Benedict 1993; Dragiewicz 2011; Meyers 1994; Richards, Gillespie, and
Smith 2011). Furthermore, some scholars point out that crime news
functions as hegemonic ideology, which not only obscures the character
of crime, but also reinforces existing power structures and fundamental
inequalities (Hall et al. 1978; Herman and Chomsky 2002; Jewkes 2010;
Meyers 1994). Feminist scholars have produced copious research on VAW in
the media. However, there is less research which specifically focuses on
femicides; enlists both qualitative and quantitative analyses; and
examines intersectional discourses (Richards, Gillespie, and Smith
2011). In this article I discuss findings from a mixed qualitative and
quantitative analysis of femicide articles in Hawaii's two major
dailies---the Honolulu Advertiser and Star-Bulletin, between 2000-2008.
In the following sections I review the existing literature on crime and
VAW in the media, discuss Hawaii as a distinct context for such a study
(especially in regards to race), provide a methodological overview,
outline key story components, discuss how these themes cluster to form
the social problem and acceptable violence frames, and conclude by
briefly summarizing my argument and discussing its theoretical
relevance.

#### Sympathetic narratives recreate focuses on individual agency that cover up structural issues- implies that singular action can solve for complex and nuanced issues forecloses broader discussions of how femicide operates.

[Sympathy narratives]{.underline} are surely superior to simplistic or
victim-blaming coverage. However, they are not entirely unproblematic.
Sympathy narratives are [often contingent on particular forms of victim
agency]{.underline}, for example, attempting to leave an abuser. This
might [encourage blaming victims]{.underline} who are unable to attempt
leaving an abuser. Additionally, [emphasizing]{.underline} TROs [without
discussing structural/cultural solutions]{.underline} implies that the
criminal justice system is the only appropriate solution to domestic
violence. Furthermore, articles tended to imply TROs were highly
effective, portraying these femicides as the rare exceptions when TROs
were not effective. Yet, research has shown that TROs are often
ineffective in cases of severe abuse (Grau, Fagan, and Wexler 1984;
Harrell and Smith 1996). Finally, one might argue that **[the emphasis
on individual agency implicit in sympathy narratives is a masculinist
standard that perpetuates patriarchy]{.underline}**. Essentially, these
discourses conceal the role of patriarchy by suggesting that the state
has already provided for women the tools with which to combat DV and
that the responsibility of accessing these tools is ultimately up to
victims. Still, coverage including sympathy narratives and TRO
discussions was more contextualized and sympathetic than coverage
employing the acceptable violence frame. The preceding discussion of
these eight story components--- characterization as DV, official source
use, alternative (family/friends or advocate/experts) source use,
forensic reporting, ambiguous headlines, victim-blaming, sympathy
narratives, and TRO discussions---illuminates the foundations of the
divergent femicide framing in Hawaii news. Table 1 provides the
frequencies of these components in the sample. Some of these components,
such as forensic reporting, help to create a rather decontextualized,
non-problematizing representation of femicides. I call this the
acceptable violence frame. However, some components, such as
identification of the crime as domestic violence, create an alternate
representation of femicides that was far more sympathetic to
victims---the social problem frame. As mentioned earlier, these [themes
constitute patriarchal discourse in that they selectively portray
domestic violence, inhibiting public appreciation for this crime as a
social problem and patriarchal product]{.underline} (Dragiewicz 2011;
Howe 1997; Kozol 1995; Meyers 1994; Walby 1989; Websdale and Alvarez
1998). However, these two frames and their wider ideological role are
more apparent when examined in a manner accounting for class-based and
racializing discourses. The next section will discuss how class and race
contribute to the disparate framing of femicides in Hawaii.

Ministry Says." *The Times of Israel*,
www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-defense-exports-down-to-7-5-billion-in-2018-ministry-says/.

The Defense Ministry said Wednesday that [defense exports in 2018 were
worth around \$7.5 billion, down almost \$2 billion from a year earlier.
According to the ministry's exports department, about a quarter of the
sales were for missiles and missile defense systems. Around 15 percent
of defense exports were of unmanned aircraft, 14% were of radar systems
and electronic warfare systems, 14% were upgrades and avionics and 12%
were weapons stations]{.underline}. In addition there were exports of
optronics systems, satellite and space systems as well as cyber
products. The figures were down from 2017, which saw \$9.2 billion in
sales, boosted by Israel's \$2.5 billion deal with India for the Barak 8
missile system that year. The figures for 2018 were also depressed by
the Croatia's canceled deal to buy 12 F-16 fighter jets from Israel
after the US objected to the sale, and India canceling a deal to buy
Spike missiles for \$500 million, but still beat the figures for 2016 by
\$1 billion. "This is [further proof of the desire of many countries to
cooperate with the State of Israel and express confidence in the
excellent capabilities of our defense industry]{.underline}," said
Michel Ben-Baruch, head of the ministry's export department. According
to the figures, 46% of Israeli defense exports in 2018 were to Asia and
the Pacific, 26% to Europe, 20% to North America, 6% to Latin America
and 2% to Africa. An Israeli F-16 fighter jet fires a 'Rampage'

world's eighth-largest weapons exporter, with India, Azerbaijan and
Vietnam its three largest clients in 2014-2018,]{.underline} according
to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
released last month. Israel was responsible for 3.1% of global arms
exports in the period surveyed, a 60% increase in volume over previous
years. Israel sees the defense exports as key to driving upgraded ties
with countries around the world, but it has come under scrutiny for
sales of weapons, drones and cyberspying technology to regimes accused
of having spotty human rights records. Israel's defense exports are
regulated according to a 2007 law that requires defense contractors to
consider what and where the Israeli weapons will be used for. The law is
designed to prevent companies from knowingly selling weapons to
countries that intend to use them to commit atrocities. An Elbit Systems
Ltd. Hermes 900 StarLiner drone, capable of flying in domestic, civilian
airspace alongside commercial jets. (Elbit Systems Ltd.) While the
contractors are legally required to take potential human rights
violations into consideration under the law, this requirement can be
overruled out of diplomatic or security concerns. Currently, Israeli law
only prevents the sale of weapons to countries that are under an
official embargo from the UN Security Council. However, such embargoes
rarely happen, generally because of vetoes by China and Russia. Most
recently, Israel has been accused of supplying Myanmar with "advanced
weapons" during the country's ethnic cleansing campaign against its
Rohingya Muslims, and of selling guns and other systems to South Sudan,
where a civil war has raged for years. The ministry has also been
criticized for allowing Herzliya-based NSO Group to sell phone-tracking
technology to regimes accused of using it against activists. The logo of
the Israeli company NSO Group is displayed on a building where they had
offices in Herzliya until 2016. (AP Photo/Daniella Cheslow) In 2018,
controversial Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte told President
Reuven [Rivlin that his country would henceforth only buy weapons from
Israel due to its lack of restrictions. He has said in the past that he
sees Israel as an alternative supplier of weapons after the US and other
countries refused to sell him arms over human rights
violations.]{.underline}

#### That means that the aff *precludes* any actual attempt at revolution. The idea that American businesses can just stop selling their goods to Israel and that will magically amount to real change is completely illogical -- Israel is a fucking country. Its not like the reading of the 1ac actually change anything and the idea that the aff is what alters Israel's maiming of Palestinians is dangerous. There is a necessary tradeoff between "revolution" that entails things like not using plastic straws and actual praxis. The aff is a bid to make their ethical stance seem more pure. 

#### Thus the PIK -- the united states federal government should actively sell arms to the Palestinian liberation movement -- a Marxist Leninist liberatory movement - in order to disrupt the Zionist occupation in Israel. The counterplan is uniquely key to establishing new modes of civilization in Palestine, and break the the ties between imperialism and Zionism -- this is not compatible withs the affirmatives *underlying ideas surround how revolution operates* -- the reading of the 1ac is the evidence that the aff doesn't care about actual praxis.

[The Palestinian liberation movement is not racist or hostile to the

Israeli military, political and economic entity which is based on
aggression, expansion and organic unity with the interests of
imperialism in our homeland. It is against Zionism as a racist
aggressive movement in alliance with imperialism. Zionism has
capitalised on the suffering of the Jewish people to serve its interests
and those of imperialism in this rich part of the world, which is the
gateway to the countries of Africa and Asia. **The aim of the
Palestinian liberation movement is the establishment of a national
democratic state in Palestine in which the Arabs and Jews can live as
equal citizens with regard to rights and duties, forming an integral
part of the democratic progressive Arab national existence which will
live peacefully with all the progressive forces in the
world**.]{.underline} The Palestinian liberation movement is a
progressive national movement against the forces of aggression and
imperialism. The link between the interests of imperialism and the
continued existence of Israel will make our war against the latter
basically a war against imperialism. On the other hand the link between
the Palestinian liberation movement and the Arab progressive movement
will make our war against Israel that of 100 million Arabs in their
national and unified struggle. [The battle of Palestine today, and all
the objective circumstances surrounding it, will make the war a starting
point for the attainment of the interconnected aims of the Arab
revolution]{.underline}. Lastly the Palestinian war, as far as the
Palestinian and Arab people are concerned, will lead to the civilisation
of the Arabs and result in the transition of the Arab people from the
state of under- development to the requirements of modern life. Through
our war of liberation we shall acquire political awareness of the facts
of this age, and we shall throw aside delusions and learn the value of
facts. [The habits of under-development exemplified in surrender,
dependence, individuality, tribalism, laziness, anarchy and
extemporisation will be changed, through the war of liberation. In their
place will come: the realisation of the value of time, organisation,
accuracy, objective thinking, the importance of collective action,
planning, total mobilisation; interest in education and acquisition of
all its weapons, and knowledge of the value of the human being; the
freeing of woman-half of society- from the bondage of decadent habits
and customs; the basis of nationalism in confronting dangers and the
supremacy of this connection over tribalism and regionalism**. Our
long-term national war of liberation implies our fusion in a new way of
life and our starting point on the road of progress and

**Marriot '18** (David, "Cultural Memory in the Present, WHITHER FANON?
Studies in the Blackness of Being", Stanford University Press, 68-347)
B.M.

2\. *Petrification* (*pétrification*). Fanon uses the terms "petrified"
and "petrification" in the two opening chapters of *The Wretched of the
Earth* to refer to a kind of hardening, or of being turned into stone;
since the whole effect of colonialism is to mortify the "culture" and
"*Erlebnis*" of [black embodied life, it is evident that the colonized
are not at liberty to simply express them- selves, and conversely, what
freedom they do possess is heavily restricted and
restrained]{.underline}. The truth of petrification thus refers to [the
work of imposition within us, the sense of wanting to flee or speak but
remaining frozen, under the weight of a certain *style* of
embodiment]{.underline} (petrified, rigidified, inanimate, ankylotic),
by [which the body mimes or acts out the signs of its own subjugation
and its own petrified perversion as a subject.]{.underline}
\....*Sociogeny* (*sociogénie*). In his first book, *Black Skin, White
Masks*, Fanon writes: "Beside \[Freudian notions of\] phylogeny and
ontogeny stands sociogeny. In one sense, conforming to the view of
Leconte and Damey, let us say that this is a question of a
sociodiagnostic."5 What is the content of this sociodiagnostic? What
does the sociogenic signify? By definition, the term clearly indicates a
response to Freudian psychoanalysis, and it forms the basis for Fanon's
dual turn from phylogeny and ontogeny to that of racialization. In fact,
in the early chapters of *Black Skin, White Masks*, Fanon presents
**[black life as an effigy (but one dazed by its appearance), as a being
dispossessed by the racist connotation of the body that it is unable to
evade or escape.]{.underline}** Living under the law of white supremacy,
[blacks necessarily experience themselves as continually hated and,
caught up as they are in a morbid fixation on the dominant culture, they
remain suspended in an imaginary white projection of
themselves]{.underline}, the better to appear "in" culture through their
disappearance as a black. In such a divided state, there is nothing more
abhorrent to these white-identified subjects than to see themselves as
*nègre* and no greater disgrace than to fall into the "pit of
niggerhood," the very definition of what it means to be a subject
bereft, impotent, and socially benighted. In a more obscure way,
blackness becomes the symbol of a veil that forces the *colonisé* to
invent, to love, to mourn the loss of a whiteness buried within, an
inner purity that is faded, absorbed, *in travail*. This innermost loss,
identified with the master's language and culture, makes the relation to
blackness *irreal* by making the *nègre*, who is both model and rival,
*servile* to the white being that surpasses it\.....\[347\] Since the
slave cannot easily play the role of a legal person---even when legal
personality ironically refers to itself as enslaved, it maintains the
illusion of itself as formerly free---it follows that as society
establishes, recognizes, and assumes the racial rights of citizenship,
the black subject must confront the discomforting possibility that
**[any performance of black social life is always corpsed by the fact
that racial blackness is seen to be the performance of radical
indebtedness or loss. The sum of black being therefore, and its highest
power, is to know itself as a mortgaged claim on the living, that is,
blacks must learn not to speak or perform life, nor to desire this role.
For the idea that black life can be rendered as a livable life that
matters, rather than a life lived in a state of injury or permanent non-
existence, is to effectively transform it by corpsing the failed
performance that blackness is]{.underline}**. The white subject cannot
understand this; it seems foolish to him because he has too meager a
knowledge of what black life is, and he finds nothing in black culture
that he can refer to that makes any impression on his conviction that
black flesh is only a thing he can take pleasure in owning or scorning,
for knowledge of what it means to be black always takes the form of the
following kind of existential reasoning: if he were black he would kill
himself (because he would be already dead).6 But those who know that
they possess nothing more than life's refusal will certainly judge that
being and right are the most unreal realities\.....Thus we see that
revolutionary Marxism promises, as the reward for liberating (the
socially dead) Eurydice, an improbable absolution "that knows it is
transitory," and that condenses three different elements in Sartre's
reading---the poem that is reborn as politics, the desire to become that
fades into sacrificial non-existence, and the corpse putrefying because,
as Sartre says, it is "unamenable to analysis": and yet, in this
gratifyingly obscure allegory of philosophy, Sartre concludes that any
attempt to name or conceptualize black Eurydice philosophically is bound
to fail, for only poetry (as conceived posthumously by philosophy) can
capture her "luminous night of unknowing."49 All this evidently proves
that, for the socially dead, the affect of being dead is both known and
unknown to us, and that it follows from the ordering of black being.
This, then, is what is explicitly the matter with **[black life; nowhere
does it murder itself more than when it feels most alive, and nowhere is
it more dead than when it relates to the living as a pious claim that it
be allowed to come into being without the attribute of being already
dead.]{.underline}** It is no wonder then that Fanon should challenge
this opinion as both symptomatic and foreclosed! Further, all these
opinions of Sartre's insist that negritude is solely a mythic
understanding of black experience. It now occurs to me that my own
reading of "Orphée noir" in *Haunted Life* was perhaps too readily
prepared to credit this myth of a black Eurydice. I may have been
looking *too* closely at her and, in consequence of this fixation, found
myself blinded---unseeing, dazzled---by the com- munity of spectators
who have confidently turned to philosophy to name or reveal Eurydice's
meaning. In trying so hard to see her, to be the redeeming spectator,
have I really done nothing but become a reader-celebrant of her loss?
But no, not quite: after Fanon, who found himself walking both towards
and away from her, it is clear that any reading of negritude is itself a
revendication, and one that shifts the entire argument about the limits
of analysis; my observation is that this is key to his reading of
negritude after all. It therefore comes as no surprise that Fanon, ever
resistant to teleological narratives, should also resist the symbolism
of a text as always already readable precisely in so far as it is
unamenable to (white) analysis.

#### Activism is sutured within an anti-black blueprint -- under the current socio-ideological constellation the anxious expectation that nothing will happen competes with the desperate demand to do something about injustice -- this is the way anti-blackness demands activism function so it can absorb resistance and solicit it to

Black Negativity, or the Affirmation of Nothing,

pg. 9-29, B.M.)

So, this tear in the world, this tearing of the world, this torn world
\... you see indexes of its ramifications within and across the field of
black studies itself---which for me is an unlimited field---that being
part of the dehiscence I mentioned in my earlier essay. I initially
borrowed from the *Écrits* (2006) of Jacques Lacan, where dehiscence
refers, in part, to the internal splitting of the subject by the
imposition of language and the abolition of access, conscious access, to
what might be called a real relation to being. Thereafter, one must
wrestle with language to articulate the inarticulable and, in the
process, live out and live with the e\"ects of such signifying action at
the level of embodiment, a\"ect, memory, and the like. But dehiscence
has a helpful polyvalence---thanks to Richard Yoder for speaking to
this---indicating, in surgical medicine, the opening up of a wound along
the lines of incision (either because the wound was inadequately sutured
or has become infected or subjected to further trauma), or, in botany,
the opening up of plants along a seam at the age of maturity as a means
of dissemination, or, in otology, the perforation in the inner ear
labyrinth causing chronic disequilibrium or vertigo. These themes of
wounding, dissemination, and vertigo all loom large in my
thinking\....In this protracted effort, of course, there is a necessary
element of defense against the undertones---or, more usually, the clear
overtones---of **[anti-blackness that provide both the message and the
medium of the radical betrayal of radicality in thought and action, a
certain ceding of potentiality]{.underline}** (not to be confused with
mere possibility) **[in search of ground, base, foundation. Operating
without need of a base, a willingness to operate in a way that is
groundless, baseless, without foundation]{.underline}** is not just the
good old anti-foundationalism that exercised the minds of late-twentieth
century philosophers, historians, political theorists, and literary and
cultural critics; in part, because there is no rejection of a concept of
totality here. Fanon was tracking something like this, I think, in his
insistence, late in *Black Skin, White Masks*, on "introducing invention
into existence" (Fanon, 2008a: 179). And on this point I really prefer
the Markmann translation to the Philcox translation. Philcox has it as
"introducing invention into life" (Fanon, 2008b: 204), which
unnecessarily restricts Fanon's commentary to the realm of life, or the
*bios*/*zoe* couplet, and leaves aside the entire realm of non-life, or
*geos* (Povinelli, 2016). ..Now, Zizek's "Bartleby politics" are
obviously not quietist, insofar as they are meant to prepare the way for
a true political act. (Frédéric Neyrat \[2014\] has a related
conception: "Rather than its heart, **[passivity should be the skin of
politics. Without passivity, without a 'negative capability,' to refer
to Keats's notion, there isn't any creative imagination, this chaotic
imagination that generates the promises of new worlds]{.underline}**."
And, not for nothing, Hortense Spillers (2003) makes another, earlier
argument for "negative capability" in a pair of essays first published
in the 1990s, "The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual: A Post-Date" and
"All The Things You Could Be By Now If Sigmund Freud's Wife Was Your
Mother: Psychoanalysis and Race." But the interregnum that opens up
between the frenetic, aggressively passive **["activism" of the current
socio-ideological constellation--- in which "the anxious expectation
that nothing will happen" competes with "the desperate demand to do
something"---and that new constellation brought into being by the
introduction of some fundamental indeterminancy---a negativity that is,
as you rightly note above, strictly unfathomable]{.underline}**---that
interregnum would seem to require the cultivation of an oxymoronic
*passive activity*. Does it make sense to speak of a need for
"passivism" (not to be confused with the homophonic term "pacifism")?
Think of the performative contradiction of trying to relax; the harder
you try to attain it, the more it evades you. As every athlete worth
their salt knows, your best performance requires your least effort. [The
more you relax, the more intensely you can exert yourself. In this
scenario, you do more the less you try\...**It's worth thinking about
this seriously in the Trump era**]{.underline} (using Trump here as a
symbol for the consolidation of a whole post-civil rights, post-cold
war, post-9/11 dispensation), **[given how greatly the ongoing
reactionary campaign benefits from and requires any and all imagery of
protest, political or pedestrian, as evidence---"alternative factual
evidence"---supporting a narrative, ultimately, of white victimization
and oppressive black power]{.underline}** (and all the conflictual
transliterations of this antagonism seen today---from the land and
resource battles in the heartland to the travel bans at the borders).
Given, that is, **[how frustratingly ineffective that protest seems to
be in the face of an entire infrastructure that not only absorbs
resistance, but solicits it too]{.underline}**. [It makes you nostalgic
for the days of good old-fashioned repression and co-optation (days
which, of course, never really existed in *black*), because at least
then you knew you were on to something truly oppositional, subversive,
alternate.]{.underline} [I don't think it's a coincidence that, under
such conditions, black (or blackened) artists are drawn with some
regularity to paradoxical ideas about fighting anti-blackness by over-
identifying with its desire to disappear or distort or disfigure
blackness, taking it over and enforcing it hyperbolically, satirically,
even vindictively]{.underline}. I think Paul Beatty's literature has
done this to great effect for twenty years or more---from *White Boy
Shu!e* (1996) to *The Sellout* (2015)---and you could add to that titles
like Darius James's *Negrophobia* (1992) and Kola Boof's *Sexy Part of
the Bible* (2011); consider as well the work of Betye Saar and Kara
Walker and Michael Ray Charles in the visual arts, the comedy of Dave
Chappelle and Leslie Jones, or films like Spike Lee's *Bamboozled*
(2000) and Lars von Trier's *Manderlay* (2005) and Jordan Peele's *Get
Out* (2017). I don't want to get too much into the weeds of the current
conjuncture and lose track of the larger structural problem posed by
blackness and **[anti-blackness]{.underline}**, a problem that confounds
the very distinction between structure and conjuncture in the first
place. It is not just the exigencies of the **[present moment or the
strategic and tactical challenges facing the Movement for Black Lives
that raise the question of how to intervene, of how to introduce
"invention into existence]{.underline}**," as Fanon put it. What I've
called "[a groundless or baseless politics that does not proceed from a
margin of power, a politics with no (final) recourse to foundations of
any sort, a politics forged from critical resources immanent to the
situation, resources from anywhere and anyone, which is to say from
nowhere and no one in particular]{.underline}" (Sexton, 2016b: 589);
**[this approach to politics would seem to entail a total rejection of
transcendence]{.underline}**, a politics of pure immanence without the
Archimedean point. And in one sense it is, but I am attuned to the
difficulties arising from an abandonment of the negative in our
enthusiasm for the affirmative, and so I want to think not so much about
transcendence viz. immanence as about the various forms or modalities of
transcendence and immanence that can be mobilized.

#### They may be right about the understanding of blackness being in excess our argument is that the excess does not translate into material disruptions of legality blackness excess is not juris generative because the flesh predetermines the revolutionary potentiality of that excess in the first place

Significance of Race in America, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2016.
P. 18-21) B.M.

**[The corporeal integrity of my Black body undergoes an onslaught as
the white imaginary, which centuries of white hegemony have structured
and shaped, ruminates over my dark flesh and vomits me out in a form not
in accordance with how I see myself]{.underline}**. From the context of
my lived experience, I feel "external," as it were, to my body,
delivered and sealed in white lies. 6 The reality is that I find myself
within a normative space, a historically structured and structuring
space, through which I am "seen" and judged guilty a priori. I find
myself in the North American context, where the discourses of race and
racism possess a shared intelligibility. Not only do I actively
negotiate my course of action within this space but it is also a space
within which [I am part of an interpretive stream, which has configured
my identity and shaped my course of action.]{.underline} **[I am said to
bear the pernicious mark of dark skin. My darkness is a signifier of
negative values grounded within a racist, social, and historical matrix
that predates my existential emergence]{.underline}**. The meaning of my
Blackness is not intrinsic to my natural pigment; it has become a value
laden "given," an object presumed untouched and unmediated by various
contingent discursive practices, history, time, and context. My
Blackness functions as a stipulatory axiom from which conclusions can be
drawn: "Blackness is evil, not to be trusted, and guilty as such." This
stipulatory axiom forms part of a white racist distal narrative that
congeals narrative coherence and intelligibility, providing a framework
according to which the Black body is rendered "meaningful." **[Whites
"see" the Black body through the medium of historically structured forms
of "knowledge" that regard it as an object of suspicion]{.underline}**.
This understanding of the white gaze vis-​ à-​ vis tacit forms of
"knowledge" has a family resemblance to Michel Foucault's use of the
term positive unconscious. 7 In other words, whiteness comes replete
with its assumptions for what to expect of a Black body (or nonwhite
body); how dangerous and unruly it is; how unlawful, criminal, and
hypersexual it is. The discourse and comportment of whites are shaped
through tacit racist scripts, calcified modes of being that enable them
to sustain and perpetuate their whitely-​ being-​ in-​ the-​ world. 8 Frantz
Fanon observed that "not only must the black man be black; he must be
black in relation to the white man." 9 This relational dimension is
incredibly significant. 10 Hence, [the meaning of my Blackness is
constituted and configured (relationally) within a semiotic field of
axiological difference, one that is structured vis-​ à-​ vis the
construction of whiteness as the transcendental norm]{.underline}. To
say that whiteness is deemed the transcendental norm is to say that
whiteness takes itself to be that which remains the same across a field
of difference. Indeed, it determines what is deemed different without
itself being defined by that system of difference. Whiteness is that
according to which what is nonwhite is rendered other, marginal, ersatz,
strange, native, inferior, uncivilized, and ugly. Poor whites are not
simply possible instantiators of this kind of whiteness. Rather, they
have historically been and currently are invested psychologically and
morally in this kind of whiteness, dutifully juxtaposing themselves to
those inferior Black bodies, safeguarding the appellation "white" as a
magical category that names, fixes, and substantiates their ontological
superiority and special status within the Great Chain of Being ( scala
naturae ). "Yassir, boss," accompanied by bending, heard from Black
mouths was "proof" of who was in charge. These words of "respect" could
be "followed by sleazy laughter that turned human dignity into a limp
thing. But you liked it. And you felt big, important, superior even, as
you heard it, though you might not be able to read or write." 11 In
fact, the poor white body is invested in its whiteness in ways that are
precisely designed to offset the variable of poverty. Destitute and
without viable economic power, whiteness functions as an invaluable
asset. Historically, poor whites were fed on Jim Crow, even as their
stomachs went empty. As the transcendental norm, whiteness has
tremendous value within North America. The fact that poor whites shared
their whiteness with wealthy whites was enough to instill within the
former a sense of "greatness," but this was to some extent based upon a
false equivalence: Poor whites confused "You're white like us," with
"You're one of us." However, being white created a sense of solidarity
that kept poor whites content even when it meant their own political and
economic demise. As indicated above, unlike Black bodies physically
confiscated from Africa, my body is confiscated within social spaces of
meaning construction and social spaces of transversal interaction that
are buttressed by a racist value-​ laden episteme. It is a peculiar
experience to have one's body confiscated without physically being
placed in chains. Well-​ dressed, I enter an elevator where a white woman
waits to reach her floor. She "sees" my Black body, though not the same
one I have seen reflected back to me from the mirror on any number of
occasions. Buying into the myth that one's dress says something about
the person, one might think that the markers of my dress (suit and tie)
should ease her tension. What is it that makes the markers of my dress
inoperative? She sees a Black male body "supersaturated with meaning, as
they \[Black bodies\] have been relentlessly subjected to \[negative\]
characterization by newspapers, newscasters, popular film, television
programming, public officials, policy pundits and other agents of
representation." 12 Her body language signifies, "Look, the Black!" On
this score, though short of a performative locution, her body language
functions as an insult. Over and above how my body is clothed, she
"sees" a criminal, she sees me as a threat. Phenomenologically, she
might be said to "see" a Black, fleeting expanse, a peripherally
glimpsed vague presence of something dark, forbidden, and dreadful. She
does not see a dynamic subjectivity, but a sort, something eviscerated
of individuality, flattened, and rendered vacuous of genuine human
feelings. However, she is one of the "walking dead," unaware of how the
feeling of her white bodily upsurge and expansiveness is purchased at
the expense of my Black body. **[Independently of any threatening action
on my part, my Black body, my existence in Black, poses a threat. It is
not necessary that I first perform a threatening action]{.underline}**.
The question of deeds is irrelevant. I need not do anything. After all,
"the torturer is the black man, Satan is black, one talks of shadows,
when one is dirty one is black---​ whether one is thinking of physical
dirtiness or moral dirtiness." 13 **[It is as if my Black body has
always already committed a criminal deed . As a result, my being as
being-​ for-​ itself, my freedom, is fundamentally called into
question]{.underline}**. Who I have become as partly constituted through
the history of my own actions is apparently nugatory. My dark body
occludes the presumption of innocence. It is as if one's Blackness is a
congenital defect, one that burdens the body with tremendous inherited
guilt. On this reading, one might say that Blackness functions
metaphorically as original sin. There is not anything as such that a
Black body needs to do in order to be found blameworthy.

#### The narrative of sociopolitical redemption for the Palestinian people requires the barring of the slave from the imaginary of redemption. This black phobogenesis shared by both Israeli and Palestinian people is the concrete slab upon which the edifice of human articulation is built and cohered.

friend was speaking openly and without his internal censors at work,
which was fine---he was grieving. At one point, [he said that it
was]{.underline} really shameful and [humiliating the way Israeli men
ran their hands over your body when they stop you at a checkpoint. Then
he said that the deepest sense of humiliation was felt when the Israeli
soldier was an Ethiopian Jew.]{.underline} Needless to say, this tidbit
of information gave me pause. I didn't know what to make of this. I was
pleased that he felt so comfortable with me that he could speak openly
and honestly, but [I was also deeply hurt at the thought that my place
in the collective unconscious of Arabs was the same location of general
dishonor]{.underline} (Patterson) [that I occupied in the collective
unconscious of White Americans]{.underline}. I gathered enough wits
about me to inform him that [that was odd]{.underline}, seeing as how

do their dirty work? [What was it about Blacks that made us so
fungible]{.underline} (Hartman 1997) we could be tossed like salad in

faced with the realization that, **[in the collective unconscious, the

#### The alternative is an embracement of pathology that is a disruption of the dialectics that constitute the very anti-black grammar of the world that maintains its coherency 

Sexton '11 (Jared, The Social Life of Social Death: On Afro-Pessimism
and Black Optimism, York University (Toronto, Canada) Issue 5
(Fall/Winter 2011)pg 15-28) B.M.

To interrogate "the *racial* discourses of life philosophy" is to
demonstrate that the question of life cannot be pried apart from that
thorniest of problems: "the problem of the Negro as a problem for
thought," that dubious and doubtless "fact of blackness," or what I will
call, in yet another register, the social life of social death.vi This
is as much an inquiry about the nature of nature as it is about the
politics of nature and the nature of politics; in other words, it is
metapolitical no less than it is metaphysical. In charting the
intellectual prehistory of the theorization of biopolitics, Jones also
forecasts---and reframes---the biotechnological anxiety or euphoria
provoked by the prospect of engineered life in our own time *and* the
way that prospect is powerfully associated with notions of social,
economic, and political possibility. Reading Deleuze and Guattari,
Foucault or Agamben cannot remain the same, nor should it, to the degree
that we have engaged the tragic-comic complexities of existence in
black. Moten might follow, at another pace, the long qualification of
vitalism that Jones accomplishes in her text, just as he might read
skeptically the implications of an affirmative biopolitics. The question
that remains, beyond the immediate negotiation even as it continues to
loop back to it, is whether a politics, which is also to say an
aesthetics, that affirms (social) life can avoid the thanatological dead
end if it does not will its own (social) death. Marriott might call
this, with Fanon, "[**the need to affirm affirmation through
negation\...not as a moral imperative\...but as a psychopolitical
necessity**"]{.underline} (Marriott 2007: 273 fn. 9).vii \...\...
Elsewhere, in a discussion of Du Bois on the study of black folk, Gordon
restates an existential phenomenological conception of the antiblack
world developed across his first several books: "Blacks here suffer the
phobogenic reality posed by the spirit of racial seriousness. In effect,
they more than symbolize or signify various social pathologies---they
become them. [In our antiblack world, blacks *are*
pathology]{.underline}" (Gordon 2000: 87). This conception would seem to
support Moten's contention that even much radical black studies
scholarship sustains the association of blackness with a certain sense
of decay and thereby fortifies and extends the interlocutory life of
widely accepted political common sense. In fact, it would seem that
Gordon deepens the already problematic association to the level of
identity. And yet, this is precisely what Gordon argues is the value and
insight of Fanon: he fully accepts the definition of himself as
pathological as it is imposed by a world that knows *itself* through
that imposition, rather than remaining in a reactive stance that insists
on the (temporal, moral, etc.) heterogeneity between a self and an imago
originating in culture. Though it may appear counterintuitive, or rather
because it is counterintuitive, this acceptance or affirmation is
active; it is a willing or willingness, in other words, to pay whatever
social costs accrue to being black, to inhabiting blackness, to living a
black social life under the shadow of social death. This is not an
accommodation to the dictates of the antiblack world. **[The affirmation
of blackness, which is to say an affirmation of pathological being, is a
refusal to distance oneself from blackness in a valorization of minor
differences that bring one closer to health, to life, or to
sociality]{.underline}**. Fanon writes in the first chapter of *Black
Skin, White Masks*, "The Black Man and Language": "A Senegalese who
learns Creole to pass for Antillean is a case of alienation. The
Antilleans who make a mockery out of him are lacking in judgment" (Fanon
2008: 21). In a world structured by the twin axioms of white superiority
and black inferiority, of white existence and black nonexistence, a
world structured by a negative categorical imperative--- "above all,
don't be black" (Gordon 1997: 63)---**[in this world, the zero degree of
transformation is the turn toward blackness, a turn toward the shame, as
it were, that "resides in the idea that 'I am thought of as less than
human'"]{.underline}** (Nyong'o 2002: 389).**xiv [In this we might
create a transvaluation of pathology itself, something like an embrace
of pathology without pathos]{.underline}**\..... [To speak of black
social life *and* black social death, black social life *against* black
social death, black social life *as* black social death, **black social
life in black social death**]{.underline}---all of this is to find
oneself in the midst of an argument that is also a profound agreement,
an agreement that takes shape in (between) *meconnaissance* and
(dis)belief. Black optimism is not the negation of the negation that is
afro-pessimism, just as black social life does not negate black social
death by inhabiting it and vitalizing it. A living death is as much a
death as it is a living. [Nothing in afro-pessimism suggests that there
is no black (social) life, only that black life is not social life in
the universe formed by the codes of state and civil society, of citizen
and subject, of nation and culture, of people and place, of history and
heritage, of all the things that colonial society has in common with the
colonized, of all that capital has in common with labor---the modern
world system. Black life is not lived in the world that the world lives
in, but it is lived underground, in outer space]{.underline}. This is
agreed. That is to say, what Moten asserts against afro-pessimism is a
point already affirmed by afro-pessimism, is, in fact, one of the most
polemical dimensions of afro-pessimism as a project: namely, **[that
black life is not social, or rather that black life is *lived* in social
*death*. Double emphasis, on lived and on death.]{.underline}** That's
the whole point of the enterprise at some level. It is all about the
implications of this agreed- upon point where arguments (should) begin,
but they cannot (yet) proceed.

### TURN -- BDS BAD

#### BDS is not radical -- it is deeply conservative and fails to call into question the US as a colonial state and remains too invested in the politics of Palestinian recognition.

**Sperber 16** \[Joshua Sperber, "BDS, Israel, and the World System,"
Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol 45, No 1, 2015/16, p 8 //tjb\]

The most prominent example of contemporary Left criticism of Israel is
of course BDS itself. BDS, which reflects the work of sincere, devoted,
and at times courageous activists, should be credited for raising
awareness of Israel's abuse of Palestinians. But **[BDS, which looks to
an imperialist system to resolve problems that imperialism has produced,
is neither radical nor liberatory. Indeed, BDS supporters demonstrate a
fundamental weakness in their position when they are unable to
adequately answer why, given that Israeli violence is contingent upon
U.S. support, BDS doesn't oppose the United States
itself?]{.underline}** \[24\] The answer, reflecting political impotence
that should be interrogated rather than accommodated, is that those who
support peace and justice do not have the power to make the United
States do what they want. **[Instead of addressing the implications of
this reality, however, BDS advocates either blame their powerlessness on
the Israel lobby or sidestep the question of their powerlessness
altogether, ultimately proceeding by ignoring the United States and
targeting its Israeli client.]{.underline}** \[25\] **[But if activists
are powerless against the U.S. patron, what makes them believe that it
is worthwhile to exert power against the Israeli client? Clients, the
history of the modern Middle East demonstrates, can be
replaced.]{.underline}** **[Moreover, targeting Israel (the client)
instead of the United States (the patron) mystifies the source, and
purpose, of the power that activists ostensibly seek to challenge; the
problems in the Middle East did not begin with the creation of Israel
and would hardly cease with its disappearance. And considering that
U.S.-based BDS activists are so powerless against their own state---the
oldest living democracy, after all---why should Palestinians be
encouraged to create one of their own?]{.underline}** **[It is
significant that many U.S. leftists, who rightly condemn their own
society's violence and poverty, and who have recently witnessed their
government's brutal protection of the status quo during the coordinated
police actions that crushed the Occupy Wall Street movement, deem good
enough for Palestinians what they themselves are compelled to
protest.]{.underline}** **[It is similarly significant that BDS attempts
to wield sanctions, a form of "soft power" that states use to bend other
states to their will, against Israel. For sanctions to become something
other than a mere moral position, they require states to enforce
them.]{.underline}** But under what circumstances would, say, the United
States or United Kingdom apply sanctions against Israel? **[Do BDS
supporters really believe that the Obama administration shares their
moral concerns about Palestinian suffering? What does it imply that
sanctions, taken to their logical conclusion, promote a role reversal in
which the Palestinian Authority (PA) would become a U.S. proxy and
Israel would become a sanctioned "rogue state"?]{.underline}** And as
long as sanctions are "an essential part of demonstrating disapproval,"
\[26\] why not express this disapproval in a manner that does not invoke
and thereby reinforce the international system of which the
Israel-Palestine catastrophe is but a part? The most controversial
aspect of BDS is its support for the Palestinian right of return. Norman
Finkelstein has criticized BDS in this regard, claiming that the right
of return's arguably de facto establishment of a Palestinian state would
put an end to Israel. \[27\] Strangely, however, Finkelstein's objection
is that such an outcome would be inconsistent with international law and
popular opinion. In the first case, as many BDS advocates have noted,
BDS's call for the right of return is in fact in line with UN Resolution
194. In the second case, it is reactionary in the extreme to suggest
that political demands should conform to the attitudes and prejudices of
mainstream opinion. In fact, the greatest historic advances have
resulted precisely from challenging rather than accepting dubious
popular beliefs, and BDS's call for the right of return reflects the
elementary bargaining tactic of asking for a great deal in order to
receive something at all. Per contra Finkelstein, **[BDS is not
problematic for being unrealistic or unpalatable to the masses but
because it is deeply conservative.]{.underline}**

#### BDS maintains the nation-state system -- this turns the aff because it means genocidal violence perpetuates, as BDS only seeks to intervene in the relation between the client and provider of arms -- that's not a liberatory politic, just a deeply conservative retrenchment of the US/Israeli relation.

**Sperber 16** \[Joshua Sperber, "BDS, Israel, and the World System,"

To return to the question posed above, why then do so many critics
abandon their conventional analytic frameworks for interpreting the
world when it comes to Israel? I argue that such interpretations result
from a convergence of two phenomena: **[the existence of generally
unquestioned yet problematic liberal-left ontologies and a widespread
erroneous perception of Israel's uniqueness. Broadly speaking, the Left
promotes concepts that are neither designed nor intended to advance its
interests.]{.underline}** For instance, **[Judith Butler has written,
"[The BDS movement has become the]{.mark} most important contemporary
[alliance calling for]{.mark} an end to forms of citizenship based on
racial stratification, insisting on [rights of political
self-determination for those for whom]{.mark} such [basic freedoms are
denied]{.mark} or indefinitely suspended, [insisting]{.mark} as well [on
substantial ways of redressing the rights of those forcibly and/or
illegally dispossessed of property and land]{.mark}."]{.underline}**
\[33\] But one need only examine the contemporary world to doubt the
merits of citizenship. **[While [it is undeniably oppressive to be
excluded from citizenship]{.mark} (the production of a defining outside
is part and parcel of citizenship's raison d'être), [Jewish Israeli
citizens are subject to]{.mark} the same [domination]{.mark},
vulnerability, and exploitation that [nearly all members of modern
states are.]{.mark} Not merely neoliberalism but [capitalism has
maintained the existence of an exploited Jewish Israeli working
class]{.mark} that has [to appease bosses at the threat of hunger and
landlords at the threat of homelessness.]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[34\]
**[Proactively [demanding such a status for all does little other than
subordinate notions of liberation to a fetishized regressive
egalitarianism.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Further, the historically and
explicitly tractable nature of rights does not prevent Butler from
demanding that they be restored to Palestinians. But who grants these
rights in the first place, and who has the power to restore them? And
who retains the power to suspend them again if they see fit, as they are
suspended now? **[Articulating a historically grounded skepticism of
rights, Giorgio Agamben has suggested that: It is time to stop regarding
declarations of rights as proclamations of eternal, meta-juridical
values binding the legislator (in fact, without much success) to respect
eternal ethical principles, and to begin to consider them according to
their real historical function in the modern nation
state.]{.underline}** The same bare life that in the ancien régime was
politically neutral and belonged to God as creaturely life . . . now
fully enters into the structure of the state and even becomes the
earthly foundation of the state's legitimacy and sovereignty. \[35\]
**[[While the Left tends to invoke citizenship and rights as defenses
against institutional power, it by contrast generally acclaims democracy
as an unquestioned good.]{.underline}]{.mark}** And the Left's
indignation concerning Israel arises from, as much as any other factor,
the fact that Israel, notwithstanding restricted Arab representation in
the Knesset, is not democratic. Israel, besides having declared itself
"a light unto nations," is one of the last liberal states to grant
formal rights to its predominantly European-descended majority while
denying these rights (from property and marriage rights to the right of
return) to its predominantly indigenous minorities (namely, Arabs and
other non-Jews) who constitute 25 percent of the Israeli population
proper. **[[The resemblance between]{.mark} this de facto and de jure
legal, political, and social discrimination and [nineteenth-century
European colonialism, as well as apartheid South Africa and the Jim Crow
South, encourages the anti-racist Left to view Israel as a]{.mark}
particularly hypocritical and offensive [relic of an unacceptable and
bygone era.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[It is precisely this relationship
between a ruling group of predominantly white and biologically defined
Jews and an excluded group of mainly Muslim people of color that makes
Israel salient in the Left imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There are
numerous reasons why there have not been prominent leftist protests of
Saudi Arabia or Chad, countries with horrendous social divisions and
oppression, but chief among them is that in these countries the rulers
by and large look---at least to most observers in the Global
North---like the ruled. And it is in part the largely unquestioned
fealty to the concept and practice of democracy that prevents the Left
from composing a genuinely radical critique of the world, and a fortiori
Israel, as it exists today. **[That the desire for democracy is
ubiquitous should, but apparently does not, raise concern among leftists
whose protest chant of "This is what democracy looks like" comfortably
coexists with warmongering presidents' vows to bring democracy to the
Middle East.]{.underline}** While leftists are enamored with the notion
of the demos ruling themselves, they spend less time examining the
content and purposes of this rule. **[[Fixated on the who and the how
rather than the what and the why, leftists valorize mere proceduralism,
a form without content.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The devastating, if not
absurd, consequences of the Left's fixation on democracy were recently
on display in Greece, where the left-wing coalition, Syriza, was seen as
scoring a partial victory over the European Union (EU) when the latter
permitted the socialists to self-manage the EU's austerity program,
which of course does nothing to challenge poverty as such and on the
contrary ideologically reinforces it as an unavoidable fact of life.
**[And [leftists]{.mark} of course frequently [compare Israel to South
Africa and invoke apartheid's demise as an inspiring model]{.mark} to
emulate. It need not defend racist South African rule, however, to note
that [South African poverty is as devastating today as it has ever been,
but because this poverty is administered by putative representatives of
the majority population, the Left, and the world as a whole, take far
less notice]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[That leftist supporters
of Palestinian nationalism invoke such models of self-administered
poverty as examples of radical politics indicates that the Left]{.mark},
beholden in spite of itself to a form of identity politics, [has in
effect adopted the economic and political interests of a Palestinian
ruling class that is eager to exploit Palestinian workers without
external interference.]{.mark}]{.underline}** At best, such a stance
reveals a fatal paucity of political imagination. \* \* \* However,
problematic liberal-left assumptions are ubiquitous and therefore cannot
of themselves explain the Left's idiosyncratic treatment of Israel. This
treatment results, I argue, from the convergence of these liberal-left
presuppositions with a prevailing perception of Israeli nationalism
itself, a perception that should be distinguished from the prosaic
material reality of the historical development of Zionism and the
Israeli nation-state. The modern project of the nation-state fuses the
two institutions that compose its name, but while states, whether
dynastic, monarchical, or papal, have existed for millennia, the concept
of the nation did not develop until the late eighteenth century. And
whereas the state is a territorial fact, the nation is socially
constructed, an "imagined community" that bases its legitimacy and
authority on an ancient "tradition" that paradoxically could only have
been "invented" under modernity. The inherently contrived nature of the
nation was perhaps best evinced by Massimo d'Azeglio's well-known
pronouncement following Italy's 1862 unification, "We have made Italy.
Now we must make Italians." Nevertheless, throughout the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, nationalism, defined as real, became "real in its
effects." Nationalism both produced and articulated the collective
self-identification and political aims of, most prominently,
independence movements that defined themselves in opposition to the
multinational Hapsburg, Ottoman, and Romanov empires that collapsed
following World War I and the European and Japanese colonial empires
that collapsed following World War II. Notwithstanding the role of key
economic factors, these national independence movements evolved
politically in part as reactions to rule by perceived interlopers in
particular geographic areas, whether in Serbia, Kenya, Vietnam, or
India. It is not difficult to view Zionism as being distinct in this
regard. A minority nearly everywhere but a majority nowhere, Jewish
nationalists did not fight for control of any of the lands where they
resided except for late Mandatory Palestine, where most Jews were
relative newcomers. Instead of constructing a national identity within
the context of a localized and concrete struggle with a dominant power
that they sought to win independence from, Zionism invoked a globally
diffused religious-ethnic-cum-national identity whose demand for a state
(whether in Argentina, Uganda, or ultimately Palestine) was initially
distinct from any single, ongoing, territorially specific struggle. That
is, instead of adopting nationalism as the language of its political
struggle, Zionism sought a specific and winnable political struggle that
would enable it to implement its nationalism. This was a nationalism
that, instead of defining itself against the Habsburgs, French, or
British, sought in this respect to define itself far more abstractly
against all. \[36\] Zionism in fact exploited this imagined abstractness
in order to mystify its ethnic cleansing of indigenous Palestinians whom
it universalized as "mere" Arabs. \[37\] Whereas the contemporary Left
indeed criticizes Zionism for having achieved its national independence
at the expense of the indigenous population, I am suggesting that it is
this notion of Zionism's abstractness that ironically helps account for
the perceived precariousness of Zionism's legitimacy outside of the
conservative biblical imagination. Such abstractness was only reinforced
by the explicit contingency accompanying Israel's creation. Israeli
statehood was dramatically established with the UN's 1947 vote, which
was influenced by sympathy from the "international community" (more
accurately, the Great Powers) for what remained of European Jews
following the Nazi genocide. The problem with such a "gift," however, is
that everyone knows that gifts can be withdrawn, a perception that to
some extent characterizes Israel as an anomalously tenuous member of the
"family of nations." There was a revealing presumptuousness in the Great
Powers' resolution of the Jewish Question at the expense of, not
European Christians who had historically persecuted Jews as such, but,
Muslim Arabs who had historically been far more tolerant of Jews whom
they either treated as one minority among others or respected as a
fellow "People of the Book." As Israel's abuse of Palestinians has
become more visible and abhorrent, it is difficult for its critics not
to wonder whether Israel is forfeiting the goodwill that enabled it to
become a state in the first place. To be sure, the Zionist lesson of the
Judeocide at first glance appears convincing, although not in the manner
in which the defenders of a Jewish state imagine. If there is a common
denominator in the Nazis' conceptions and persecution of Jews it is that
of nationless-ness. The Nazis conceived of Jews as, in the
pseudo-scientific language of the day, an unassimilable "virus" that
attacks not merely the "host" but the "host's" very "immune system."
\[38\] More specifically, Nazi ideology conceived of the Jews as less of
an "actual" race than an "anti-race" existing outside of the Nazis'
carefully constructed racial hierarchy. \[39\] Simultaneously, the Nazis
feared Jews as the personification of Judeo-Bolshevism, a historical
force that was understood as an existential threat to Germany's borders,
national identity, social relations, and statehood. The common
characteristic uniting these seemingly disparate categorizations is that
they both define the Jew as intrinsically international or, more
precisely, nationless. I argue that it is only through examining the
Nazis' dread of nationless-ness that we can reconcile the apparent
contradiction in the Nazis' description of the Jew as both international
communist and global capitalist. Similarly, it is only through the idea
of nationless-ness that we can adequately account for the Nazis'
ferocious persecution of their second-most hated enemy: the Gypsies, of
whom half a million were murdered. And Nazism, lest we forget,
represented nationalism par excellence**[. [It is then mindless if not
cruel to conclude that the appropriate response to the Nazis' genocide
is the creation of yet another state rather than the radical criticism
of nationalism and the system of nation-states
itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For the creation of Israel has not only
led to the oppression of non-Jews but has also failed to protect the
security of its Jewish citizens; Netanyahu's exhortations to European
Jews to immigrate to their supposed haven are belied by his perpetual
warnings of an impending Iranian nuclear attack. **[Moreover, it is not
only Jews who have been destroyed by nation-constructing or
empire-building states but also Native Americans and Armenians in
addition to a great many others.]{.underline}** In this regard, the
"lesson of the Holocaust" is more relevant to the terrible vulnerability
of the stateless and putatively unassimilable Palestinians than it is to
Israel, which in the final analysis is defined less by any supposed
Jewish essence than by the economic and political demands that confront
all states. As Nicholas De Genova has asserted, "The heritage of the
Holocaust belongs to the Palestinian people. The State of Israel has no
claim to the heritage of the Holocaust. The heritage of the oppressed
belongs to the oppressed, not the oppressor." \[40\] **[But if [it is
unreasonable to suggest that the solution to Jewish suffering is a
Jewish state, it is just as unreasonable to suggest that the solution to
Palestinian suffering is a Palestinian state.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[Expressing a weariness of the notion that the only alternative to
being a victim is to become a persecutor, Jean Genet has asserted, "The
day when the Palestinians become institutionalized . . . I will no
longer be at their side. The day the Palestinians become a nation like
the other nations, I will no longer be there]{.mark}.]{.underline}**"
\[41\] **[Such a stance hardly entails inaction. On the contrary, it
expresses an understanding that human l[iberation will result not from
joining the very institutions that are responsible for mass suffering
but from criticizing their fundamental purposes and]{.mark}, through
this criticism, [articulating a world worth fighting

**Qutami 14** \[Loubna Qutami, "Rethinking the Single Story: BDS,
Transnational Cross Movement Building and the Palestine Analytic"
*Social Text Online* from *Circuits of Influence: US, Israel,
Palestine*, June 17, 2014 //tjb\]

On the other hand, as a Palestinian organizer living in the US, I find
that the recent wind of support for the boycott is not only long
over-due, but that it highlights a single story: the story of Boycott,
Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), as definitive of the Palestinian
struggle, or at least how one can and should be in solidarity with
Palestinians. As scholar-activists we must remain mindful that our work
is only made possible by the continued oppression of our communities
here and transnationally, their constant struggle for survival and
freedom, and their heroic displays of resilience and steadfastness.
However, **[there is so much that [[the BDS story cannot possibly detail
for the struggle of the Palestinian
people](http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/14983/eight-years-of-the-bds-movement_where-have-we-come).]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The single story does not recognize the proliferation of the BDS
campaign and most recent forms of international solidarity being
directly entangled with the vacuum of power among Palestinians
themselves, both those of us in our homeland and in exile. **[It does
not recognize that [the widespread attention]{.mark} paid [to Palestine
today is]{.mark} also [tied to the fact that conditions on the ground
are rapidly deteriorating]{.mark} coupled with the obliteration of our
national movement, fragmentation of our lands and people, [and the
[proliferation of a petit bourgeoisie Palestinian
leadership](http://al-shabaka.org/node/372) to act as the gatekeepers to
occupation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It does not undertake the return of
the refugees to their historic lands in 1948 Palestine. **[It cannot
detail how the massacres of refugees in the camps, such as in the case
of [Yarmouk camp in
Syria](http://www.palestinechronicle.com/how-not-to-be-in-solidarity-with-palestinian-refugees-in-yarmouk/#.U4PetfldXKA),
is intrinsically linked to Zionist settler colonialism of
Palestine.]{.underline}** **[[The story of BDS cannot]{.mark} entirely
[account for]{.mark} our [settler-colonial context, the destabilization
of the region and the implementation of racial caste and segregation
systems]{.mark} as a part of an [ongoing process of ethnic
cleansing](http://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC12_scans/12.zionist.colonialism.palestine.1965.pdf).]{.underline}**
Without acknowledging this, how can the BDS story truly highlight the
importance that the Palestine dimension, or what I would call, the
Palestine analytic,\* can bring to struggles across movements and
places? **[[The story of BDS does not explain how and why Palestinian
and Arab people have continued to resist]{.mark} despite these
deteriorating conditions.]{.underline}** **[The BDS story cannot texture
the experiences, aspirations, desires, voices and needs of [Palestinian
youth]{.mark} of my generation who [are seeking a [political framework
outside of the exhausted political paradigm and vocabulary of
Oslo](http://www.amazon.com/Jil-Oslo-Palestinian-Culture-Movement/dp/1939067073).]{.mark}]{.underline}**
It does not give power back to them to be the protagonists of their own
stories. It creates a single story, one largely shaped outside of us.
Though it is a positive and an inspirational one, in the absence of
space to explore the many stories, the complexity of collective
consciousness and of transnational organizing, **[[BDS alone becomes a
place holding story.]{.mark} It has the power to flatten both those
stories that constitute it and exist in its periphery. [For many the
boycott is a streamlined, pragmatic, and relevant strategy through which
allies can support Palestinians]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[For many of
us Palestinians, it is a means through which we can locate power]{.mark}
somewhere, and more specifically to locate it [outside of the messiness
of our own]{.mark} complicated colonial [condition]{.mark}. [So, we
chopped up our national liberation struggle, we made it simple, we made
it easy, palatable, accommodating to Western liberal values and legal
standards of humanism.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But if we are to listen a
bit more carefully, provide some attentiveness to those most vulnerable
to Zionism, the notion of the single story collapses. If you ask a five
year old Palestinian child in any city in Palestine why they love the
homeland, they won't tell you that it is because international civil
society said that it was more noteworthy than any other place or
struggle in the world. If you ask an elder in the camps of Yarmouk,
Dheisha, Shatila, or Wahdat, or exiled in any place in the world why
they remember and want to return to Palestine, they will not say because
UN resolution 194 said we had the right to. **[So [why]{.mark} then, [do
we invoke exceptionalism, law, and rights, as the primary analytics
through which we talk about Palestinians]{.mark} if this is not quite
how Palestinians talk about themselves?]{.underline}** What does it do,
to make one story the universal solidarity story? How do the politics of
pity and empathy reproduce the structures of colonial violence
Palestinians continue to resist? I believe there is a different way to
do solidarity---not a new way and also not some creative campaign that
got wind with the rise of social media, but the way it has always been
done before Palestine became as chic as it has. **[Let me, as a
Palestinian, one of millions of voices, one of the multiplicity of
stories, tell you that I do not want solidarity from any one person or
institution who cannot and does not see Palestinian liberation as
central to their own. I do not want solidarity from anyone who cannot
see how examining a Palestine analytic in their struggle and in their
space, can create opportunities for more nuanced, effective and
justice-centered intellectualism and movement work.]{.underline}** Many
of us Palestinians see [our liberation as central to the liberation of
other
peoples](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/palestinian-activists-condemn-lethal-attack-zapatista-brothers-and-sisters)
and this is why we do not want to be made an exception. **[[It is those
acts of solidarity that are not legible as solidarity]{.mark} these days
[that I value most.]{.mark} Engagement, process, and relationships are
among the most important methods of building solidarity
praxis.]{.underline}** The relationship between Palestinian and
Filipino/a students and youth are important sites to examine a true
understanding of solidarity; one of [shared movements and
joint-struggle](http://www.ussocialforum.net/wsfpalestine-solidarity).
This was the case for the [General Union of Palestine
Students](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents)
(GUPS) and the [League of Filipino
Students](https://www.facebook.com/elepsPH) (LFS) at San Francisco State
University during the years of 2003-2011. SFSU was our stomping ground.
We joined each other in fights against U.S. wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq, against fee hikes and budget cuts, against racism, sexism and
Islamofascism on our very own campus and against attacks on Ethnic
Studies programs and professors. Between 2004 and 2007, The League of
Filipino Students (LFS) was among the first student organizations who
supported the GUPS initiative to inaugurate the [Palestinian Cultural
Mural honoring Edward
Said](http://www.petitiononline.com/petitions/mural/signatures?page=25)despite
the [severe forms of Zionist
backlash](http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=461012b5a2a2ed42de26f38a8ef28479)
and the three-year battle. The relationship that had been built through
the University and extended then through broader community alliances
became a lynchpin in providing the grounds for many of us Palestinian
youth to re-envision social movements, justice, anti-imperialism, and
youth and student mobilization entirely. This became no more known than
when [Anak Bayan](http://anakbayanusa.org/),
[Bayan](http://bayanusa.org/), and
[Gabriella-USA](https://socialtextjournal.org/periscope_article/rethinking-the-single-story-bds-transnational-cross-movement-building-and-the-palestine-analytic/Gabusa.org)
invited [Palestinian Youth Movement](http://www.pymusa.org/)(PYM) to
attend their general assemblies as member observers in 2012 while also
joining as founding members of the [International League of People's
Struggles](http://www.ilps.info/index.php/en/current-events/106-statements-and-press-releases/north-america/432-ilps-us-chapter-holds-historic-founding-assembly-confronts-nato-summit-in-chicago)
(ILPS) US chapter. They asked the PYM to deliver a solidarity statement
for the struggle against imperialism in the Philippines. For us, this
was a moment in which we realized we had allies who saw us and the
broader Palestinian struggle as integral to their own political project.
They did not spend time developing a relationship with us because they
pitied us. No. They cared what we had to say, and they felt like they
had a lot to learn from us as well. That act of calling for solidarity
was perhaps more of a gesture of solidarity toward us Palestinians; it
was a gesture that raised our expectations of our own selves as social
justice organizers. We now knew that movements relied on us, on
Palestine's liberation as central to their own. A feeling that we often
felt toward other struggles but rarely felt ourselves. **[Without
dragging us through muddled debates regarding technicalities of
language, they accepted an anti-Zionist position indefinitely. They did
not request that we package or articulate our struggle in a more
accommodating tone and language, an experience we Palestinians of the
Diaspora have regularly in other solidarity circuits. Their allowing us
to watch them through their general assemblies---to take avid notes on
the importance of structure, building movement culture, and
accountability---were among the great lessons as well.]{.underline}** We
envied them for their ability to mass mobilize, and yet we were inspired
to believe that if we mobilize as long and hard that we too can change
the tides of our struggling movement. **[[They provided us an
opportunity to re-configure what solidarity means, and to expand our
commitment to justice, liberation, and peoples movements beyond the
confines of powerlessness, ethno-centrism, ultra-dogmatic-nationalism,
and liberal conceptions of nation-state sovereignty.]{.mark} [More
importantly, they allowed us to join them, and many of our other
partners such as the [Malcolm X Grassroots Movement](http://mxgm.org/),
in struggles for dignity, justice, and liberation on local, national and
transnational levels.]{.mark} Through all this, they have never blamed
us for not having the material resources, capacity, time, and capital to
organize at the level they could. Rather, they extended hands of support
and recognized our condition without reducing us to an essentialzed
victim status.]{.underline}** **[We can see here how [the single BDS
success story does not recognize different forms, histories, and stories
of solidarity that are in fact less about "final solutions" and symbolic
displays of partnership]{.mark} but rather about collective
processes.]{.underline}** **[[If we are to consider a passing of a
resolution to be the measure of success, the measure of the tide
changing, or a measure of how much better things can get for
Palestinians, then we have missed the point.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This
then becomes the single story that defines the Arab relationship with
API communities and the Palestine analytic of Asian American Studies,
American Studies and other fields, communities and movements. It is only
in thinking about processes that we can expand limitations of our
academic disciplines and of our political loyalties. We can see our
stories as multi-dimensional, as embedded in one another and learn from
the process of creating stories. So I ask all of us, can we think beyond
BDS as the single story of the Palestinians? Can we understand it as
embedded in a long history of (settler) colonialism, dispossession, and
occupation that has taken various forms in the transnational context?
More importantly, can we see embedded in each other, the stories of
peoples' movements? Can we recognize that the victories accomplished
through BDS are not in fact the passing of the resolutions themselves,
but the process through which we forge cross-movement work, share
stories, and contextualize the importance of Palestine as a dimension
and analytic in our fields of study and movements? Only by asking
ourselves these questions can we be able to recognize new opportunities
made possible by the call for academic boycott. We will be able to see
how, as [Fred Moten says, "The call for solidarity is an act of
solidarity itself"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVb879D5b0M)which
can help us strengthen justice-centered approaches to our own critical
discourse, movements and fields. In doing so, the greatest gesture of
solidarity would be afforded to the Palestinians as well.

of the country, the main city centers, will go about their opulent lives
in an ever more crafty, ever more sophisticated, ever more shimmering
deconstruction. [They will illuminate the whole planet with their
glaring neon lights, as the patrols of the BAC and private security
companies (i.e. paramilitary units) proliferate under the umbrella of an
increasingly shameless judicial protection.]{.underline}

My family had cordial relations with our Jewish neighbours. We lived on
Stanton Street, which wasn\'t far from the Jewish quarter, Hadar, the
fashionable Fifth Avenue of Haifa. I knew Jewish children; Tamara, one
of my best friends, was Jewish, but I knew that there was no distinction
between us. I was conscious of being neither Arab nor Jew. The
turning-point in my relationship with Tamara came on November 29, 1947,
when the UN partitioned Palestine between Tamara and me. Tamara was
awarded 56 per cent of my land. (Her own people claimed only eight per
cent ownership of the whole land of Palestine, according to their own
statistics.) I was expected to accede to this demand and congratulate
Tamara\'s people. I was expected to deny my humanity, acknowledge the
moral legitimacy of the Zionist claims, and accept the status of being
homeless in my own home, a refugee in my own land. World Zionism,
American Imperialism and all their allies sentenced me to a life of
exile for being an Arab. Then they expected us to honour their
\"decision\" and abide by it. Because, if we bided by that \"decision\",
Zionist claims would be satisfied, their territorial expansion would end
and their Aliyahs immigrations would cease. [The UN \"decision\" to
partition Palestine prompted a general strike that lasted for three
days. The strike was totally ineffective. The Arab National Movement was
exhausted; it was a mere ghost, a disorganised, emotional mob. The
traditional institutions disintegrated; the newer confederations of
workers and peasants weren\'t sufficiently developed to take up the
cause of national liberation. We were foredoomed. Sporadic violence
broke out: Arabs killed Jews, Jews killed Arabs. But Jewish violence was
organised and disciplined. They were thoroughly mobilised and they knew
what they were fighting for. Arab violence was ill planned, random
activity carried on by individuals. The Zionists had camaraderie as well
as gunpowder; they had well-organised armed forces and they excelled in
psychological warfare. Their leaders were at the head of their columns;
ours were securely ensconced in Mount Lebanon or Cairo.]{.underline} The
Zionists were thus able to snatch Haifa out

### TURN -- Puar bad

#### Puar is a racist whose analysis explicitly excludes Arab Israeli queers like the author and who misunderstands that material conditions like health care equality actually are key to queer mobility. In addition, homonatioanlism is explicitly disproven through the amount of time in which there has been anti-Arab sentiment and the amount of time that gay marriage has been a political issue.

**Fucktheory 11** (Fucktheory, Arab Israeli queer blogger and academic,

GR

Speaking of international relations, let's take a second to think about
that other front of queer radicality, [the "homonationalism" about which
Jasbir Puar continues to warn us so selflessly in her op-ed pieces in
the Guardian (I'd quote her book, but I couldn't manage to stomach more
than 2 or 3 pages.  Nothing makes me throw up in my mouth faster than
closeted pseudo-Hegelianism hiding behind an invocation of Deleuze's
name).]{.underline}   From what I can understand of Puar's muddled
arguments, the concept of "homonationalism" refers to the way in which
some queer subject are folded into the mainstream of social and
discursive practices, but only in order to exclude or else at the
expense of other queer subjects, who are largely non-white and
non-rich.  Thus, she notes in this op-ed that "What is gaining acute
force is the anti-Muslim form that such missionary politics are
currently taking. From the liberation of burqa-wearing women as a
partial rationale for invasion of the Middle East, to gay marriage as a
barometer of civilisational aptitude, to Sex and the City 2's trading in
banal, unsophisticated orientalist fantasies, propagating anti-Muslim
attitudes is becoming the most expeditious passage to national
belonging.\"  [While I'm absolutely not denying that homosexuals can be
as racist as anyone]{.underline} and that acquisition of representation
and political power inevitably comes at the expense of someone else
(there's only so much of the pie to go around[), the idea that the value
of gay marriage consists solely of providing a barometer against which
to distinguish ourselves from our Arab neighbors is
absurd.]{.underline}  Let me be perfectly blunt:  racism is a deep,
all-pervading, profound problem, and racism against Middle Easterners of
non-Jewish extraction is a particularly profound and particularly
entrenched form of racism.  But [if you consider the number of centuries
during which the West has been producing hideous stereotypes of Arabs
and compare that to the number of years during which gay marriage has
been a political issue, it becomes quite obvious that gay marriage
didn't come along in order to prove how ass-backwards Arabs
are.**  **According to this interview with Puar, there's a fundamental
\"liberal" correlation between the movement for gay marriage and the
embracing of "reproductive kinship"]{.underline} (the linkages with the
Proud White Perverts become apparent).   Now, let's stop and ask
ourselves the following basic question[:  if the task at hand is to
resist the "heteronormative" imperative of "reproductive kinship," how
the fuck are we supposed to do that if we are legally prohibited from
establishing alternative, governmentally recognized forms of queer
affiliation?  Because at the end of the day, that's what it comes down
to.  Let me be perfectly explicit - I could give a rat's ass what the
straight people across the hall think, or what the religious right
thinks, or what people in the subway think who stare at me and my
partner think when we take the A train downtown (the idea that Mahattan
is a gay-friendly homo-paradise ends very quickly when you start going
too far uptown, and we happen to live in Washington Heights).  I don't
need gay marriage because I want recognition from straight people.  I
need gay marriage because I want equality before the law.  Because if my
partner has an accident, I need to be legally entitled to make medical
decisions for him.  Because if straight people get tax breaks for
cohabiting, I want them too.  Shit's expensive.  Because if I'm paying
for a health care plan under which my partner would be eligible for
coverage if my partner was a woman, I should be able to get coverage for
my partner despite his having a penis.]{.underline}  But most
importantly[, because the movement of exclusion that Puar seems so
concerned about - the acceptance of a certain kind of queer subject at
the expense of the queer huddled masses - can ONLY be rectified by
increasing the mobility of bodies]{.underline}, [that is, the power of
queer bodies to act.  By making them not only upwardly mobile, but
laterally mobile - that is, by allowing queer subjects to cross national
and social boundaries without having to become, in exchange, those
particular kinds of queer subjects that are included in contemporary
social organizations.  And that involves eliminating draconian measures
like the prohibition on immigration for HIV+ individuals, and the gross
injustice which makes it possible for heterosexual foreigners to build a
life in this country with their partners but impossible for homosexual
ones to do so.  ** **]{.underline}Let me be perfectly explicit - if you
consider yourself a queer theorist, your primary theoretical task is to
understand and struggle to improve the lived material existence of queer
subjects[.  I'm a queer subject.  I'm a Middle-Eastern queer subject, in
fact (though Puar's racism is simplistic enough to draw a unilateral
divide between Israeli queer subjects and Arabic queer subjects, so she
might not consider me to be the kind of subject she's talking about. 
Wait, I guess that makes me a queer subject that doesn't fit into the
categories expressed by those queers who speak from a position of
authority and privilege, like, say a Rutgers professor who publishes an
op-ed piece in a newspaper with an international audience).  And the
absence of gay marriage on a federal level in this country is an issue
that has direct, explicit, oppressive impact on my lived
reality. ]{.underline}

#### Puar is indefensibly Anti-Semitic 

**Marquardt-Bigman 16 (**Petra, Ph.D. in Contemporary History, "Rutgers
Prof Insists Her Updated Version of the Blood Libel is Not
Anti-Semitic," The Tower, 3/20/16,
http://www.thetower.org/3117-rutgers-prof-insists-her-updated-version-of-the-blood-libel-is-not-anti-semitic/)//MLM

In her Jadaliyya column, Puar asserted that her talk at Vassar "was
taped without my permission or that of the people who had invited me"
and therefore ought to be suppressed. At the same time, she apparently
believes that the principles of academic freedom and free speech entitle
her to uncritically repeat and elaborate on any accusations the
Palestinians level against Israel, while also claiming that her critics
have no right to exercise their own academic freedom and free speech
rights to criticize her. Referencing her almost decade-long "Palestine
solidarity work," [Puar denounces criticism of her]{.underline} Vassar
[lecture as a rightwing "smear campaign" that reflect]{.underline}s a
"current [Zionist strategy" of "silencing and intimidation
tactics]{.underline}" intended to constrain the "exercise of free speech
and academic freedom." Complaining that there was "a complete lack of
engagement with the substance" of her claims, Puar declares that she
"unequivocally" stands by her "research and scholarship." [In
an]{.underline} [apparent effort to demonstrate the soundness of
her]{.underline} academic [work, Puar devotes several
paragraphs]{.underline} of her Jadaliyya column [to justifying
speculations that Israel is engaged in stealing Palestinian
organs]{.underline}. Before addressing Puar's arguments in more detail,
it should be noted that [her talk at Vassar was criticized not just
because of this particularly preposterous claim, but rather for its
wholesale demonization of Israel, which made her lecture a good example
of the "antisemitic anti-Zionism" that]{.underline} Alan Johnson
described so well in a widely cited Fathom Journal essay: Antisemitic
anti-Zionism [bends the meaning of Israel and Zionism out of shape until
both become fit receptacles for]{.underline} the tropes, images, and
ideas of [classical antisemitism]{.underline}. In short, [that which the
demonological Jew once was, demonological Israel now is]{.underline}:
uniquely malevolent, full of blood lust, [all-controlling, the hidden
hand]{.underline}, tricky, always acting in bad faith, [the obstacle to
a better, purer,]{.underline} more spiritual [world]{.underline},
uniquely deserving of punishment, and so on. [Puar]{.underline} clearly
[believes that Israel deserves to be depicted as the Jew among the
nations]{.underline}. Addressing one of the most controversial
statements she made in her lecture at Vassar, [she claims that she
just]{.underline} ["relayed a]{.underline} simple [ethnographic
observation"]{.underline} when she said, "Some speculate that
\[Palestinian terrorists'\] bodies were mined for organs for scientific
research." She emphasizes that her goal was "to highlight Palestinian
voices, and to amplify the speech of those who are routinely censored
out of public awareness in the United States, and in mass media more
generally." As it happens, the kind of "speech" Puar wishes to "amplify"
attracted some media attention just a few months ago, when veteran
Palestinian activist Bassem Tamimi shared a Facebook post that Tablet's
Yair Rosenberg described as "a viral anti-Semitic meme ... alleging
Israelis detain Palestinian children to steal their organs, and that
Zionists control the media to suppress this information." Writing on
October 16, 2015, Rosenberg noted that the post had been shared over
1,500 times in just two days. At the time of writing, it has been shared
over 2,000 times. It is archived here. Rosenberg quoted ADL National
Director Jonathan Greenblatt's condemnation of "Tamimi's propagation of
the anti-Semitic blood libel on social media." Greenblatt also asserted
that there "can be no justification or support for this type of hate and
incitement." While Tamimi has since deleted his post, [Puar argues that
Palestinians who suspect Israel of mining Palestinian organs do so with
good reason]{.underline}. As "evidence," she cites reports of abuse at
the Abu Kabir forensic institute near Tel Aviv that occurred almost two
decades ago and have since been thoroughly investigated. Indeed, even
the links Puar provides make clear that there was a five-year
investigation triggered by complaints from employees at the institute
and a series of investigative reports in Israeli media. While [the
reports Puar herself cites leave no doubt that these incidents happened
in violation of Israeli law and were thoroughly
investigated]{.underline}, [Puar still insinuates that Israel has a
sinister history]{.underline} of stealing organs. Preposterously enough,
[she claims that this history is "well documented" by linking to
a]{.underline} completely discredited [article published in a Swedish
tabloid]{.underline} in 2009, even though the author of the article
admitted that he had "no idea ... no clue" whether his story was "true
or not." Another Swedish paper published a somewhat cynical op-ed in
response: ["Whispers in the dark]{.underline}. Anonymous sources.
Rumors. ... [That is all it takes. After all, we all know what \[the
Jews\] are like, don't we: inhuman]{.underline}, hardened. [Capable of
anything. Now all that remains is the defense]{.underline}, equally
predictable: '[Anti-Semitism? No, no, just criticism of
Israel.']{.underline}" Professor [Puar is now working hard to give such
"whispers in the dark" academic respectability.]{.underline} She clearly
wants them to be mainstreamed as "just" and, above all, justified
"criticism of Israel." And she fully intends to continue her perverse
form of "criticism." As she herself notes, she has not only tenure at
Rutgers and the "complete support" of a "phenomenal union" and her
colleagues, but her current book project is funded by a grant from the
Rutgers University Research Council. She is also working on a film
project "tentatively titled The Coming Intifada." We are, in other
words, sure to be subjected to more of Puar's ostensibly well-researched
and scholarly insights into the monstrous evils Israel supposedly
inflicts on the Palestinians. While she remains determined to prevent
public access to materials documenting her Vassar lecture, she maintains
that criticism of her research as anti-Semitic has "absolutely no merit"
and her "descriptions of life and death in Palestine incited a smear
campaign rather than raising concerns about how the Israeli state is
treating the bodies of those they colonize." But it is not hard to
demonstrate that her "research" and "scholarship" are indeed
anti-Semitic, because [she presents falsehoods whose sole purpose is the
wholesale demonization of Israel.]{.underline} Thus, she highlights
incidents of abuse at a forensic institute that happened some 20 years
ago and that give no indication whatsoever of "how the Israeli state is
treating the bodies of those they colonize." Indeed, she cannot, since
this abuse did not reflect the policy of the Israeli state, but
constituted a violation of Israeli laws that was uncovered and duly
investigated. Moreover, [Puar is completely disingenuous when she
claims]{.underline}: "In my lecture, [I made clear that I was not making
any empirical claims about]{.underline} current [organ
mining]{.underline}." To be sure, she didn't make "empirical claims,"
but [she validated Palestinian speculations about organ theft when she
suggested that Israel might be pursuing "a weaponized epigenetics where
the outcome is not so much about winning or losing nor a solution, but
about needing body parts]{.underline}, not even whole bodies, for
research and experimentation."

## LINK -- ACADEMY K

#### Academic criticism of Israel amounts to nothing -- the aff will be pushed to the side just like Steven Salaita -- a tenured professor who lost his job over critism of Israel -- theres no solvency

**Pettit**, Emma. "\'Ousted\' From Academe, Steven Salaita Says He\'s
Driving a School Bus to Make Ends Meet." The Chronicle of Higher
Education, The Chronicle of Higher Education, 19 Feb**. 2019**,
www.chronicle.com/article/Ousted-From-Academe/245732.

[Steven G. Salaita, whose tenured-faculty appointment at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was withdrawn nearly five years ago over
his harsh criticisms of Israel, has found a new job outside the ivory
tower. He's a school-bus driver. Salaita, formerly a professor of
English at Virginia Tech, was going to assume a new post at Illinois in
the fall of 2014.]{.underline} But a string of tweets that he posted
about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drew considerable outrage.
Illinois trustees denied him the offer. And news of Salaita's dismissal,
and the extensive litigation that followed, made him a polarizing
crusader for academic freedom. Steven Salaita \@stevesalaita Let\'s cut
to the chase: If you\'re defending #Israel right now you\'re an awful
human being. Steven Salaita \@stevesalaita I repeat: if you\'re
defending #Israel right now, then \"hopelessly brainwashed\" is your
best prognosis.#Gaza #FreePalestine this Steven Salaita \@stevesalaita
This is not a conflict between #Israel and \"Hamas.\" It\'s a struggle
by an Indigenous people against a colonial power.#Gaza #FreePalestine a
position at the American University of Beirut, from which he was
"ousted," he says, due to pressure from U.S. senators and university
donors alike. (Neither Salaita nor the university immediately responded
to requests for comment, but in 2016 the university denied accusations
that Salaita had been purposefully kept from being appointed to a new
post as director of its Center for American Studies and Research.
[Eventually the University of Illinois agreed to pay Salaita a \$600,000
settlement and cover his legal fees.) A door had slammed shut on
academe, a career that had once "felt manifest," Salaita wrote in a
recent essay, "An Honest Living," posted on his personal website. "I
went to college at 17 knowing I would never leave." Twenty-one years
later, he was blocked from the Illinois position. Salaita now spends his
workday transporting children to and from school in the suburbs of
Washington, D.C]{.underline}. He performs safety checks, dozes in the
driver's seat during breaks, and deposits "mini-hordes of cantankerous
pupils into bustling subdivisions," he wrote. The life of a school-bus
driver is "surprisingly complex," Salaita wrote. "We're supposed to
facilitate access to education without considering its function in the
systems that inform our wages." Salaita doesn't see himself as an
academic anymore. "I no longer profess and therefore no longer assume
the burden of professorial expectations," he wrote. "No more civility or
nuance or dispassion or objectivity or whatever term they're using these
days to impel obedience." Denial of Job to Harsh Critic of Israel
Divides Advocates of Academic Freedom The exodus from a tenured
professorship to an hourly wage has been mired in hardships, as well as
some new freedoms. "There's something profoundly liberating about
leaving academe," he wrote. You no longer have to care "about
fashionable thinkers, network at the planet's most boring parties, or
quantify self-worth for scurrilous committees." The industry's culture
of "social control" is "insidious and pervasive," he wrote. [Still,
after months without work, Salaita said his family had suffered
financially]{.underline}. And he didn't put himself through so much
schooling to land a job that requires no college, he wrote. "Then
again," he said, "neither did I attend so many years of college in order
to be disabused of the notion that education is noble." Clarification
(2/20/2016, 9:38 a.m.): A previous version of this article stated that
"the university" had eventually paid Salaita a \$600,000 settlement. The
University of Illinois, not the American University of Beirut, paid the
settlement. The article has been corrected.

## FRAMEWORK -- TVA

#### TVA: the United states should end FMS and DCS to Israel.

#### The TVA solves - Arms sales are the enabler of the colonial ousting of Palestinians -- ending arms sales is key to ending that violence

**Glenn Greenwald '14, is a journalist, constitutional lawyer, and

ISRAELI ATTACK", 8/4/14, The Intercept,
https://theintercept.com/2014/08/04/cash-weapons-surveillance/**

[The U.S. government has long lavished overwhelming aid on Israel,
providing cash, weapons and surveillance technology that play a crucial
role in Israel's attacks on its neighbors]{.underline}. But [top secret
documents]{.underline} provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden
[shed substantial new light on how the U.S. and its partners **directly
enable Israel's military assaults** -- such as the one on
Gaza.]{.underline} Over the last decade, [the NSA has significantly
increased the surveillance assistance it provides to]{.underline} its
Israeli counterpart, [the Israeli SIGINT National Unit
(ISNU]{.underline}; also known as Unit 8200), [including data used to
monitor and target Palestinians]{.underline}. In many cases, the NSA and
ISNU work cooperatively with the British and Canadian spy agencies, the
GCHQ and CSEC. [The relationship has, on at least one occasion, entailed
the covert payment of a large amount of cash to Israeli
operatives]{.underline}. Beyond their own surveillance programs, the
American and British surveillance agencies rely on U.S.-supported Arab
regimes, including the Jordanian monarchy and even the Palestinian
Authority Security Forces, to provide vital spying services regarding
Palestinian targets. [The new documents **underscore the indispensable,
direct involvement** of the U.S. government and its key allies in
Israeli aggression against its neighbors]{.underline}. That covert
support is squarely at odds with the posture of helpless detachment
typically adopted by Obama officials and their supporters. President
Obama, in his press conference on Friday, said "it is heartbreaking to
see what's happening there," referring to the weeks of civilian deaths
in Gaza -- "as if he's just a bystander, watching it all unfold,"
observed Brooklyn College Professor Corey Robin. Robin added: "[Obama
talks about Gaza as if it were a natural disaster, an uncontrollable
biological event]{.underline}." [Each time Israel attacks Gaza and
massacres its trapped civilian population]{.underline} -- at the end of
2008, in the fall of 2012, and now again this past month -- [the same
process repeats itself in both U.S. media and government circles: **the
U.S. government feeds Israel the weapons it uses** and steadfastly
defends its aggression both publicly and at the U.N]{.underline}.; the
U.S. [Congress unanimously enacts one resolution after the next to
support and enable Israel]{.underline}; [and then American media figures
pretend that the Israeli attack has nothing to do with their
country]{.underline}, that it's just some sort of unfortunately
intractable, distant conflict between two equally intransigent foreign
parties in response to which all decent **[Americans helplessly throw up
their hands as though they bear no responsibility]{.underline}**. "The
United States has been trying to broker peace in the Middle East for the
past 20 years," wrote the liberal commentator Kevin Drum in Mother
Jones, last Tuesday. The following day, CNN reported that [the Obama
administration "agreed to Israel's request to resupply it with several
types of ammunition]{.underline} ... [Among the items being bought are
120mm mortar rounds and 40mm ammunition for grenade
launchers."]{.underline} The new Snowden documents illustrate a crucial
fact: **[Israeli aggression would be impossible without the constant,
lavish support and protection of the U.S. government]{.underline}**,
[which is anything but a neutral, peace-brokering party in these
attacks]{.underline}. And [the relationship between the NSA and its
partners on the one hand, and the Israeli spying agency on the other, is
at the center of that enabling.]{.underline} Last September, the
Guardian revealed that the NSA "routinely shares raw intelligence data
with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about US
citizens." [The paper published the full top secret Memoranadum of
Understanding between the two agencies governing that
sharing]{.underline}. **[But the NSA/ISNU relationship extends far
beyond that.]{.underline}** One newly disclosed top secret NSA document,
dated April 13, 2013 and published today by the Intercept, recounts that
[the "NSA maintains a far-reaching technical and analytic relationship
with the Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU) sharing information on
access, intercept, targeting, language, analysis and
reporting."]{.underline} Specifically, "**[this SIGINT relationship has
increasingly been the catalyst for a broader intelligence relationship
between the United States and Israel]{.underline}**." Moreover, "[NSA's
cyber partnerships expanded beyond ISNU to include Israeli Defense
Intelligence's \[Special Operation Division\] SOD and Mossad." Under
this expanded cooperation, the Americans and Israelis work together to
gain access to "geographic targets \[that\] include the countries of
North Africa, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, South Asia, and the
Islamic republics of the former Soviet Union]{.underline}." [It also
includes "a dedicated communications line between NSA and ISNU \[that\]
supports the exchange of raw material, as well as daily analytic and
technical correspondence."]{.underline} The relationship has provided
Israel with ample support for both intelligence and surveillance: "[The
Israeli side enjoys the benefits of expanded geographic access to
world-class NSA cryptanalytic and SIGINT engineering expertise, and also
gains controlled access to advanced U.S. technology and equipment
**via**]{.underline} accommodation buys and [**foreign military
sales**."]{.underline} [Among Israel's priorities for the cooperation
are what the NSA calls "Palestinian terrorism."]{.underline}

## AFF ANSWER

### Monolithic Blackness Bad

#### Conceiving of universal "anti-black political economies" is bad and forecloses change

**Gordon** **'17** (Gordon, Professor of Philosophy and African American
Studies, University of Connecticut. "Thoughts on Afropessimism."
Contemporary Political Theory Forthcoming: 1-33. Emory Libraries.) B.M.

The first is that [''**an** antiblack world'' is **not identical** with
''**the** world is antiblack.'']{.underline} My argument is that [such a
world]{.underline} is a[n antiblack racist **project**]{.underline}. [It
is **not** the historical achievement]{.underline}. [Its limitations
emerge from a basic fact: Black people and other opponents of such a
project **fought**, and **continue to fight**, as we see]{.underline}
today [in]{.underline} the
[#B]{.underline}lack[L]{.underline}ives[M]{.underline}atter movement
[and many others]{.underline}, against it. [The same]{.underline}
argument [applies to]{.underline} the argument about [social
death]{.underline}. [Such an achievement would have **rendered even
these reflections stillborn**]{.underline}. [The basic premises of the
Afropessimistic argument are]{.underline}, then, [locked in
**performative contradictions**]{.underline}. Yet, they have rhetorical
force. This is evident through the continued growth of its proponents
and forums (such as this one) devoted to it\...\... In Bad Faith and
Antiblack Racism, I argued that there are forms of antiblack racism
offered under the guise of love, though I was writing about whites who
exoticize blacks while offering themselves as white sources of black
value. Analyzed in terms of bad faith, where one lies to oneself in an
attempt to flee displeasing truths for pleasing falsehoods, exoticists
romanticize blacks while affirming white normativity, and thus
themselves, as principals of reality. These ironic, [performative
contradictions are features of all forms of racism, where one group is
elevated to godlike status and another is pushed below that of human
despite both claiming to be human]{.underline}\...\... Antiblack racism
offers whites self-other relations (necessary for ethics) with each
other but not so for groups forced in a ''zone of nonbeing'' below them.
There is asymmetry where whites stand as others who look downward to
those who are not their others or their analogues. [Antiblack racism is
thus not a problem of blacks being ''others.'']{.underline} [It's a
problem of their not-being-analogical-selves-and-not-even
being-others]{.underline}. [Fanon]{.underline}, in Black Skin, White
Masks (1952), [reminds us that Blacks **among each other** live in a
world of selves and others]{.underline}. [It is in attempted relations
with whites that these problems occur]{.underline}. Reason in such
contexts has a bad habit of walking out when Blacks enter. What are
Blacks to do? As reason cannot be forced, because that would be
''violence,'' they must ironically reason reasonably with forms of
unreasonable reason. Contradictions loom. [Racism is]{.underline}, given
these arguments, [a **project** of imposing non-relations as the model
of dealing with people designated ''black.''\.....]{.underline} In Les
Damne´ de la terre (''Damned of the Earth''), [Fanon]{.underline} goes
further and [argues that colonialism is an attempt to impose a Manichean
structure of contraries instead of a **dialectical** one of ongoing,
human negotiation of contradictions]{.underline}. [The former segregates
the groups; the latter emerges from interaction]{.underline}. The
police, he observes, are the mediator in such a situation, as their role
is force/violence instead of the human, discursive one of politics and
civility (Fanon, 1991). Such societies draw legitimacy from Black
non-existence or invisibility. Black appearance, in other words, would
be a violation of those systems. Think of the continued blight of
police, extra-judicial killings of Blacks in those countries\..... An
immediate observation of many postcolonies is that antiblack attitudes,
practices, and institutions aren't exclusively white. Black antiblack
dispositions make this clear. Black antiblackness entails Black
exoticism. Where this exists, Blacks simultaneously receive Black love
alongside Black rejection of agency. Many problems follow. [The absence
of agency bars maturation, which would reinforce the racial logic of
Blacks as in effect wards of whites]{.underline}. [Without agency,
ethics, liberation, maturation, politics, and responsibility could not
be possible]{.underline}\...\... [Afropessimism faces the problem of a
**hidden premise** of white agency versus Black
incapacity]{.underline}**.** [Proponents of Afropessimism would no doubt
respond that the theory itself is a form of agency]{.underline}
reminiscent of Fanon's famous remark that though whites created le Negre
it was les Negres who created Negritude. [Whites clearly did not create
Afropessimism, which Black liberationists should celebrate]{.underline}.
[We should avoid the **fallacy**]{.underline}, however, [of confusing
source with outcome]{.underline}. [History is not short of **bad ideas
from good people**]{.underline}. [If intrinsically good]{.underline},
however, [each person of African descent would become ethically and
epistemologically a switching of the Manichean contraries, which means
only changing players instead of the game]{.underline}. We come, then,
to the crux of the matter. [If the goal of Afropessimism is
Afropessimism, its achievement would be **attitudinal** and, in the
language of old, stoic -- in short, a **symptom** of antiblack
society]{.underline}. At this point, there are several observations that
follow. The first is a diagnosis of the implications of Afropessimism as
symptom. The second examines the epistemological implications of
Afropessimism. The third is whether a disposition counts as a political
act and, if so, is it sufficient for its avowed aims. There are more,
but for the sake of brevity, I'll simply focus on these\...\... [An
ironic dimension of pessimism is that it is the **other side** of
optimism]{.underline}. Oddly enough, [both are connected to
**nihilism**]{.underline}, which is, as Nietzsche (1968) showed, a
decline of values during periods of social decay. [It emerges when
people **no longer want to be responsible** for their
actions]{.underline}. Optimists expect intervention from beyond.
Pessimists declare relief is not forthcoming. Neither takes
responsibility for what is valued. The valuing, however, is what leads
to the second, epistemic point. [The presumption that what is at stake
is what can be known to determine what can be done is the
problem]{.underline}. [If such knowledge were possible, the debate would
be about who is reading the evidence correctly]{.underline}. [Such
judgment would be a priori -- that is, **prior to events actually
unfolding**]{.underline}. [The future, **unlike** transcendental
conditions such as language, signs, and reality, is, however, ex post
facto: It is **yet to come**]{.underline}. [Facing the future, the
question **isn't** what will be or how do we know what will be but
instead the realization that whatever **is done** will be that on which
the future will depend]{.underline}. [Rejecting optimism and pessimism,
there is a supervening alternative: **political
commitment**]{.underline}\...\.... The appeal to [political
commitment]{.underline} is not only in stream with what French
existentialists call l'intellectuel engage´ (committed intellectual) but
also [reaches back through the history and existential situation of
enslaved, racialized ancestors]{.underline}. [Many were, in truth, an
existential paradox: **commitment to action without
guarantees**]{.underline}. **[The slave revolts, micro and macro acts of
resistance, escapes, and returns help others do the same]{.underline}**;
the cultivated instability of plantations and other forms of
enslavement, and countless other actions, were waged against a gauntlet
of forces designed to eliminate any hope of success. The claim of
colonialists and enslavers was that the future belonged to them, not to
the enslaved and the indigenous. A result of more than 500 years of
conquest and 300 years of enslavement was also a (white) rewriting of
history in which African and First Nations' agency was, at least at the
level of scholarship, nearly erased. Yet there was resistance even in
that realm, as Africana and First Nation intellectual history and
scholarship attest. [Such actions **set the course** for **different
kinds of struggle today**]{.underline}\..... Such reflections occasion
meditations on the concept of failure. [Afropessimism]{.underline}, the
existential critique suggests, [suffers from a **failure to understand
failure**]{.underline}. [Consider Fanon's notion of **constructive
failure**, where what doesn't initially work **transforms conditions**
for something new to emerge]{.underline}. To understand this argument,
one must rethink the philosophical anthropology at the heart of a
specific line of Euromodern thought on what it means to be human.
Atomistic and individual-substance-based, this model, articulated by
Hobbes, Locke, and many others, is of a non-relational being that
thinks, acts, and moves along a course in which continued movement
depends on not colliding with others. Under that model, the human being
is a thing that enters a system that facilitates or obstructs its
movement. [An alternative model, shared by many groups across southern
Africa, is a relational version of the human being as part of a larger
system of meaning]{.underline}. [Actions]{.underline}, from that
perspective, [are not about whether ''I'' succeed but instead about
''our'' story across time]{.underline}. [As relational, it means that
each human being is a **constant negotiation** of **ongoing efforts** to
build relationships with others, which means no one actually enters a
situation without establishing new situations of action and
meaning]{.underline}. Instead of entering a game, their participation
requires a different kind of project -- especially where the ''game''
was premised on their exclusion. Thus, [where the system]{.underline} or
game [repels initial participation, such]{.underline} repulsion [is a
**shift in the grammar**]{.underline} of how the system functions,
especially its dependence on obsequious subjects. [Shifted energy
affords **emergence of alternatives**]{.underline}. [Kinds **cannot be
known before the actions** that birthed them]{.underline}\.....
[Abstract as this sounds, it has much historical support]{.underline}.
Evelyn [Simien]{.underline} (2016), in her insightful political study
Historic Firsts, [examines the new set of relations established
by]{.underline} Shirley [Chisholm's and]{.underline} Jesse [Jackson's
presidential campaigns]{.underline}. [There could be no]{.underline}
Barack [Obama without such important predecessors affecting the
demographics of voter participation]{.underline}. Simien intentionally
focused on the most mainstream example of political life to illustrate
this point. [Although no exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success''
emerged from Chisholm and Jackson's]{.underline} (and many others')
[so-called ''failure.'']{.underline} Beyond presidential electoral
politics, [there are numerous examples of how prior, radical so-called
''failures'' **transformed relationships** that facilitated other kinds
of outcome]{.underline}. [The trail goes back to the Haitian Revolution
and back to every act of resistance from Nat Turner's
Rebellion]{.underline} in the USA, [Sharpe's in Jamaica, or Tula's in
Curacao and so many other efforts for **social transformation to
come**]{.underline}\..... In existential terms, then, [many ancestors of
the African diaspora embodied]{.underline} what Søren Kierkegaard (1983)
calls [an existential paradox]{.underline}. [All the evidence around
them suggested failure and the futility of hope]{.underline}. [They
first had to make a movement of infinite resignation]{.underline} --
that is, resigning themselves to their situation. [Yet they must
simultaneously act against that situation]{.underline}. Kierkegaard
called this seemingly contradictory phenomenon ''faith,'' but that
concept relates more to a relationship with a transcendent, absolute
being, which could only be established by a ''leap,'' as there are no
mediations or bridge. [Ironically, if Afropessimism appeals to
transcendent intervention, it would **collapse into
faith**]{.underline}. [If, however, the argument rejects transcendent
intervention and focuses on committed political action, of taking
responsibility for a future that offers no guarantees, then the movement
from infinite resignation becomes existential **political
action**]{.underline}\...\... [At this point, the **crucial meditation**
would be on **politics and political action**]{.underline}. [An attitude
of infinite resignation to the world **without the leap of committed
action** would **simply be pessimistic or nihilistic**]{.underline}.
Similarly, [an attitude of hope or optimism about the future would lack
infinite resignation]{.underline}. [We see here the underlying failure
of the two approaches]{.underline}. [Yet ironically, there is a form of
**failure at failing** in the pessimistic turn versus the optimistic
one, since if focused exclusively on resignation as the goal, then the
''act'' of resignation would have been achieved, which,
**paradoxically**, would be a success; it would be a **successful
failing of failure**]{.underline}. [For politics to emerge]{.underline},
however, [there are two missing elements in inward pessimistic
resignation\.....]{.underline} The first is that [politics is a social
phenomenon, which means it requires the expanding options of a social
world]{.underline}. [Turning away from the social world, **though a
statement** about politics, is **not**]{.underline}, however, [in and of
itself political]{.underline}. The ancients from whom much western
political theory or philosophy claimed affinity had a disparaging term
for individuals who resigned themselves from political life: idiotes, [a
private person, one not concerned with public affairs, in a word -- an
idiot]{.underline}. I mention western political theory because that is
the hegemonic intellectual context of Afropessimism. We don't, however,
have to end our etymological journey in ancient Greek. Extending our
linguistic archaeology back a few thousand years, we could examine the
Middle Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on
by the ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack of hearing
entailed isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. The [contemporary
inward resignation of seeking a form of **purity** from the loathsome
historical reality of racial oppression]{.underline}, in this reading,
[**collapses ultimately into a form of moralism** (private, normative
satisfaction) instead of **public responsibility** born of and borne by
**action**]{.underline}\..... [The second is the importance of
power]{.underline}. [Politics makes no sense without it]{.underline}.
But what is power? Eurocentric etymology points to the Latin word potis
as its source, from which came the word ''potent'' as in an omnipotent
god. If we again look back further, we will notice the Middle Kingdom
(2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word pHty, which refers to godlike
strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast Africans, even the gods'
abilities came from a source: In the Coffin Texts, HqAw or heka
activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul, spirit, or, in a word
''magic''), which makes reality. [All this amounts to a straightforward
thesis on power as the ability with the means to make things
happen]{.underline}\...\... [There is an **alchemical quality** to
power]{.underline}. [The human world, premised on symbolic
communication, brings **many forms of meaning** into being, and those
new meanings afford relationships that **build institutions** through a
world of culture]{.underline}, a phenomenon that Freud (1989) rightly
described as ''a prosthetic god.'' It is godlike because it addresses
what humanity historically sought from the gods: protection from the
elements, physical maledictions, and social forms of misery. [Such power
clearly can be abused]{.underline}. [It is where those enabling
capacities (empowerment) are pushed to the wayside in the hording of
social resources into propping up some people as gods that the
legitimating practices of cultural cum political institutions decline
and stimulate pessimism and nihilism]{.underline}. [That institutions in
the Americas very rarely attempt establishing positive relations to
Blacks is the subtext of Afropessimism]{.underline} and this entire
meditation\...\.... [The discussion points]{.underline}, however, [to a
demand for political commitment]{.underline}. Politics itself emerges
under different names throughout the history of our species, but the one
occasioning the word ''politics'' is from the Greek polis, which refers
to ancient Hellenic city-states. It identifies specific kinds of
activities conducted inside the city-state, where order necessitated the
resolution of conflicts through rules of discourse the violation of
which could lead to (civil) war, a breaking down of relations
appropriate for ''outsiders.'' [Returning to the Fanonian observation of
selves and others, it is clear that imposed limitations on certain
groups amounts to impeding or blocking the option of
politics]{.underline}. [Yet, as a problem occurring within the polity,
the problem short of war becomes a political one]{.underline}\...\....
Returning to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this: [If
the problem of antiblack racism is conceded as political, where
antiblack institutions of power have, as their project, the impeding of
Black power, which in effect requires barring Black access to political
institutions, then antiblack societies are ultimately threats also to
politics defined as the human negotiation of the expansion of human
capabilities or more to the point: freedom]{.underline}\...\....
[Anti-politics is one of the reasons why societies in which antiblack
racism is hegemonic are]{.underline} also [those in which racial
moralizing dominates: moralizing stops at individuals at the **expense
of addressing institutions** the transformation of which would **make
immoral individuals irrelevant**]{.underline}. [As a political problem,
it **demands a political solution**]{.underline}. It [is not accidental
that Blacks continue to be the continued exemplars of unrealized
freedom]{.underline}. [As so many from]{.underline} Ida B.
[Wells-Barnett to]{.underline} Angela [Davis]{.underline} (2003)
[and]{.underline} Michelle [Alexander]{.underline} (2010) [have shown,
the expansion of privatization and incarceration is squarely placed in a
structure of states and civil societies premised on the limitations of
freedom (Blacks) -- ironically, as seen in countries such as South
Africa and the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[in the name of freedom]{.underline}\...\.... [That **power** is a
facilitating or enabling phenomenon, a functional element of the human
world, a viable response must be the **establishing of relations** that
reach **beyond the singularity of the body**]{.underline}. [I bring this
up because proponents of Afropessimism might object to this analysis
because of its appeal to a human world]{.underline}. [If that world is
abrogated, the site of struggle becomes that which is patently not
human]{.underline}. [It is **not accidental** that popular race
discourse refers today to ''black bodies,'']{.underline} for instance,
[instead of ''black people.'']{.underline} [As the human world is
discursive, social, and relational, this abandonment amounts to an
appeal to the non-relational, the **incommunicability** of singularity,
and appeals to the body and its reach]{.underline}. [At that point, it's
perhaps the]{.underline} psychologist, psychiatrist, or [psychoanalyst
who would be helpful, as turning radically inward offers the promise of
**despair**, narcissistic delusions of godliness, and, as
Fanon]{.underline} also [observed, madness]{.underline}. [Even if that
**slippery slope** were rejected, the **performative contradiction** of
attempting to communicate such singularity or absence thereof requires,
at least for **consistency**, the appropriate course of action:
**silence**]{.underline}\...\.... [The remaining question for
Afropessimism]{.underline}, especially those who are primarily
academics, [becomes this: **Why write?**]{.underline} [It's a question
for which, in both existential and political terms, I don't see how an
answer could be given from an Afropessimistic perspective without the
**unfortunate revelation of cynicism**]{.underline}. [The
**marketability** of Afropessimism is no doubt in the immediate and
**paradoxical satisfaction in dissatisfaction** it offers]{.underline}.
[We are at this point on familiar terrain]{.underline}. [As with ancient
logical paradoxes denying the viability of time and motion, the **best
option**, after a moment of immobilized reflection, is, eventually, to
**move on**, even where the pause is itself significant as an encomium
of thought]{.underline}.

#### The 1ac focus on the refusal of white racial kinship is a discursive modality as a way of disrupting the house of IR -- This use of language as a form of resistance ignores the way that anti-blackness controls language. Language's purpose is to hide, conceal, mask placing speech acts under a virtual auditor in order to over code the discourse with additional signifiers -- This makes those invested in language perpetually caught up within a system that is marked by its impossibility of recognition -- it is through the affirmatives hyper focus on language is a libidinal reproduction of their anti-black subject position \-- violence has a hold over all social relations in the colony; all pleasure and knowledge is bound to it, and no language or desire is safe from its presence or enunciation. 

**Marriott '18** (David, "Whither Fanon? Studies in the Blackness of
Being", Stanford University Press, pg. 41-260) B.M.

According to the etymology, the word *disavowal* should be linked to the
root of *disclaimer*, meaning to deny a claim (undoubtedly there exist
ways of denying a claim that maintain what is denied without confronting
it).1 Thus we find ourselves immediately at the heart of the most
important problem of Fanon's political and clinical writing: why do
people disavow what could truly liberate them? Is it possible to
conceive of another "reality" (as opposed to its disavowal) that goes
beyond this fixed and determined belief? We know that Fanon sought, in
accordance with his work as a revolutionary clinician, to bring human
decision to the status of the real, from the perversions of fantasy to
the responsibility of praxis---the moment of such encounter is doubly
articulated in his work, as a *socialthérapie* founded on that of the
group where the patient-actor is compelled to give up their defenses and
commit themselves to a new articulation of self, subject, and world. So
too he believed that in this encounter with the group [the one thing we
should be suspicious of is the language of catharsis]{.underline}; Fanon
immediately suggests that a cure does not necessarily follow from a
change in reality---indeed, his conception of praxis is resistant to the
languages of therapeutics and hermeneutics and, as we know, he presents
truly revolutionary activity as antipathetic to lived experience, in
that it necessarily forces us to exist and act in ways that induce a
moral and existential "vertigo," and this for two reasons\.....This
scandal---the simultaneously alien and intimate character of
illocution---is not directed towards the validity of translating
unconscious Arabic content into French words, nor does it even indicate
that there is al- ways an *elsewhere* to meaning when one is dealing
with an unconscious put into words; no, the scandal deduced here is due
to the evidence of Fanon's (implicitly black) foreignness, whose
difference is understood and comprehended as a scandalous practice of
listening. It is also evident that Memmi appears to take as obvious the
fact that the need for translation necessarily means that the only
signification to be recognized here is that of a non-arrival with no
genuine exchange. If we now turn to Fanon's own remarks on language we
come across a wholly different set of premises and inferences, where the
desire for meaning is shown to be an impossible desire for
communicability and **[the purpose of language is to thoroughly veil the
lexia, diction, and accent that is inevitably determined as other or
black]{.underline}**. Consequently, **[the question of speech or
locution is understood to be always a question of trying to convince
those who hear it of a non-racial dissemination, or of dissipating one's
own doubts as to the *blackness* of one's speech in the
appearing-disappearing of its stereotypical foreignness.]{.underline}**
\.... Let us explain this more clearly. It is evident from communication
in the colony that the relation between *langue* and *parole* is
discontinuous. **[Even when the message is purely denotative, it is
nonetheless]{.underline}** **[overloaded by delusionary signs (cultural,
symbolic]{.underline}**) of separation: [**linguistic performance thus
carries an additional signified**, in much the same way that the
intonation of a heavily accented French carries a literal meaning and
the separate signification of one's niggerness, or one's lowly place in
public life]{.underline}. [Even if a totally pure French were to be
achieved, it would immediately join the sign of an impurity, completed
as it is by the black body that enunciates it, while always under the
suspicion of a third---racial---pretense, of putting on airs, where the
image of an improperly spoken French is immediately determined as
*nègre*]{.underline}. In *Black Skin, White Masks*, Fanon provides
multiple examples of what happens when the desire for signification is
not only not correct but is unwittingly so, where the subject is
contemptuously thrown back into the pit of a nigger emergence, a sort of
pit where meaning empties itself. For to speak French "means above all
to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization," or to
risk being crushed under that weight.21 \...\....[Fanon does not say
that this attitude to the imperial signifier is false, or misplaced, or
that black speech could be cleared of its connotations; on the
contrary]{.underline}, it is from these stories of penalty, pretense,
and punishment meted out on behalf of an imperial French culture that he
deduces the truth of a black imaginary, or, in the last analysis, its
delusion. From what we have just shown it very plainly follows that
Fanon radically recasts the status of alterity and its limits, in terms
of the traces that difference communicates as the *other scene of the
universal*. It also follows that anyone who rejects this cultural
imperative because he or she believes in a creolized French is also
deluded. Fanon makes it clear here that the wish to possess a black
civilization of signifieds is still forced to locate these articulations
in relation to the *signifiance* of French writing, language, and
culture\...\...We should add, though, that when we say that there is an
awareness in the colony of dislocation and belatedness, we do not mean
that this aware- ness is always articulated, but only that the situation
is determined by a singular historicity in which the reality of
**[language can be understood as a kind of whitening and the sign is
experienced as an elective elocution, or is seen to evoke only a white
pretense, as if in every sign there were a trace, a "morphology," that
gives the *colonisé*, as if by a precious miracle, a white
interlocution, and a white reality from which its blackness is
excluded]{.underline}**. For in speaking French, "the Negro of the
Antilles will be proportionately whiter---that is, he will come closer
to real human being---in direct ratio to his mastery of the French
language \[*la langue française*\]."22 Speech in the colony recalls the
structure of hallucination as described by Merleau-Ponty in the
*Phenomenology of Perception*: "Hallucinations are played out on any
other stage other than the perceptible world; they exist as if in a
double exposure. . . . Any hallucination is first and foremost a
hallucination of one's own body. 'As if I were hearing my own mouth.'"23
The mouth hallucinated as a white pseudo-presence is crucial to Fanon's
analysis\.....**[Thus we see how language gets caught up in a game of
appearances, masks, and concealments, where the supposedly primary
addressee of one's discourse is put in the position of a purely virtual
auditor]{.underline}**, but above all of someone who will not mistake
this address and the reason why it is so singular: the magical white
interlocutor on which the performance depends and who will not mistake
the difference between inferiority and civilization that is the reward
of a properly spoken French. The point being not to reconcile Creole and
French in some kind of cultural equilibrium, but to distinguish them in
a radical opposition, this being the imperative of every idiomatic
expression in the colony and the rule for how one speaks in conformity
with one's duty not to be *nègre*, a lesson underscored by black family
life. For Francis Affergan, writing in *Anthropologie à la Martinique*
(1983), these obligations create a "visceral attachment" to
appearances.24 For it is certain that in the colony, to address oneself
in the language of the *semblable* is, it seems, to make a choice, and
this choice is not just an anthropological fact but an ontological
decision, to speak, to the extent that one appropriates and assimilates
*la langue française*, syntactically, lexically, phonologically, ac-
cording to the law of whiteness, inasmuch as speaking Creole **[condemns
one to an inferior tone or idiom that is definitive and absolutely
unsurpassable and that signifies a poverty of style, intellect, and
culture.]{.underline}** \...\....As for the playing out of these
tensions in the clinic, Fanon himself admits: "I myself have been aware,
in talking to certain patients, of the exact moment at which I began to
slip \[into pidgin\]. . . ."27 Once again, the image presented is that
of a *lapsus* whose unconscious meaning surprises the enunciator, for it
suggests a moment in which the mask slips, and the signifier relapses
into stereotypes, a moment in which the *Noir*, or better (since it is a
question of cultural life in the colony) the *colonisé* is *exposed* in
his utterance. At such moments, what is being put into words is
something that French cannot but render precisely because it is
unlocatable in French, even though it was there waiting to be named as a
slip that is only formulatable *in* French as mutilation. In fact, Fanon
refers to such moments as a sudden "collapse."28 In this articulation of
a therapeutic slippage, therefore, we can already glimpse a concern with
how the reversion to stereotype has consequences, analytically; namely,
a certain signification of the other that reproduces the total framework
of the socius, its ideology, its racist semiology, to which correspond
signifiers whose connotations are specified according to how they
express the thought "'You'd better keep your place.' "29 The most
important thing, however, at least in reference to place, is that it is
very hard to say just where the slip is located, sliding as it does
between, on the one hand, phantasm and interiorization, signification
and social inferiority as expressed by *créolismes* and *petit-nègre*
formulations, not to mention the policing of these borders, or limits by
public censure and ridicule; and on the other, the passage between idiom
and symbolism, propriety and power, competence and hyperbolic failure,
the excess and inadequation of black speech in the cultural life of the
colony. In other words (and this would be a valid proposition for
colonialism in general), **[the relation between cultural code and
dialectal idiom involves endless slippages between
language]{.underline}**, *langue*, and *parole* that **[produce a kind
of *affective allergy* at the level of the signifier and its meaning as
speech act. For we see here that language is no longer the place of
recognition, but of its impossibility, as Fanon teaches
us.]{.underline}**\...\.....Throughout Fanon's work there are many forms
of blackness as both object and thing, and they all imply a concomitant
expulsion of blackness from the graph of desire. They range from what
may seem to be merely fetishistic investments to what is explicitly
connected to accounts of an atrophic disappearance or lytic
rigidification of desire (used by, for example, subjects whose object
relations cannot be found in reality, but only refound in a kind of
phantasmatic real, or real fantasy). To understand this work is also to
understand Fanon's radical questioning of analysis and psycho- therapy.
The assumption that guides this analysis is very similar to Freud's
reading of *Verneinung*, but for Fanon (and in ways that recall Lacan)
blackness must be understood not as a metonym of a lost object, nor as
the material mark of a deprivation, but as the structure of a
never-having-had. In particular, we must not confuse this structure with
either loss or lack; what matters is our *relation* to its
impossibility, a relation that must here be understood more
grammatically than logically: in [the history, texts, and legacies of
anti-black racism there is always an imaginary misrecognition of an
object that has no ontological resistance to its signifying predicates,
and one whose libidinal reproduction only exists when caught up in
language]{.underline}. For Fanon, critical-therapeutic activity is thus
essentially an activity of reinvented judgment, respecting the case in
its singularity, finding the appropriate rule always only after the
event. This peculiar temporality, much more than any periodizing
hypothesis, [is what constitutes the lived life of blackness (which is
anything but escape or theft).]{.underline} \...\...In fact, then, what
is at stake in Fanon's reflections on violence is not mythic violence
but the effective violence of myth in the civilization of ra- cial
images. The analysis of decolonial struggle in *Toward the African Rev-
olution*, for example, distinguishes three levels of violence: an
originary "metaphysical" appropriation of the colony (first level) is
violently organized into effects of propriety (in this instance by the
racial classification of being, law, and property---second level), which
can then be violently dis- closed (third level) at the level of
hegemony. In short, **[violence has a hold over all *social* relations
in the colony; all pleasure and knowledge is bound to it, and no
language, law, memory, or desire is safe from its presence or
enunciation.]{.underline}**

#### Their notion of worldism presumes a futuristic telos, the possibility of alternative forms of sociality our argument is that blackness is locked out side of time and space -- blackness is a sea without terminus, a tragedy without resolution

235-236) B.M. \*edited for gendered langauge

I showed in Part One that it is because **[blackness is shattered in its
existence]{.underline}**, by intrusions produced through imposition,
that it is seized with anguish. It is the fact that I misrecognize
myself, sacrifice myself to a delusion, stupefied by my reflection, that
[I know nothing of who I am; only then do I discover the world in its
cruelty]{.underline}. I also showed that all sense of obligation is
rendered null or void, in the colonial encounter, because the *colonisé*
is not able to be Other to the white. Indeed, the *colonisé* is all the
more obligated because of this failure or flaw. When Fanon says that the
black has not encountered itself in others, he means two already
confusing things. 1. [**The black famously has no ontological resistance
to the hatreds that compel \[them\]** him **and are, so to speak,
inscribed upon \[them\]** him. **And in this sense it is impossible for
\[them\]** him **to experience \[themselves\]** himself **without the
illusion of an object lost, or sacrificed**]{.underline}. 2.
[**Blackness**, then, **is** the **vertiginous experience of its own
impossibility**, or **its experience is that of an impasse**, or
**aporia**, **that remains hidden, unknown, inauthentic**. As will,
**desire, a demand for recognition**, etc., blackness therefore **cannot
*be***,]{.underline} namely, **[its ipseity is that of a sea without
terminus, a tragedy without resolution, and so it cannot be accounted
for]{.underline}** except as *irreal* (a word that Fanon takes from
Sartre's early work on the psychology of the ego), and its
**[self-certainty denotes a perpetual deferral or waiting. Blackness is
*not*]{.underline}**, in brief, **[because it cannot be *determined* as
ever having been]{.underline}**, even negatively, because it has no
Other to ensure it. Fanon addressed this question as an existential
problem in his early work, but also as a clinical question. The recourse
to *socialthérapie* was an attempt to show how the bonds between people
are formed through negrophobia, and in a way that is entirely consistent
with an imaginary affirmation of colonial authority. For this reason we
reach the same conclusion here as we did in the first part of this book:
that the *colonisé* is haunted by its own incertitude, which is why it
is "overwhelmed by sin, riddled with guilt."1 In this second part of the
book I will discuss the implications of this haunted insecurity via
three motifs: invention, existence, and the abyssal.

slavery and its inheritability. [Slavery conscripted the womb, deciding
the fate of the unborn and reproducing slave property by making the mark
of the mother a death sentence for her child. The negation]{.underline}
or disfigurement [of maternity]{.underline}, writes Christina Sharpe,
"[turns the womb into a factory reproducing blackness as abjection and
turning the birth canal into another domestic middle
passage]{.underline}."8 Partus sequitur ventrem---replicates the fate of
the slave across generations. [The belly is made a factory of production
incommensurate with notions of the maternal, the conjugal or the
domestic]{.underline}. In short, [the slave exists out of the world and
outside the house. Labor remained a category central to the fashioning
of gender and sexuality in the context of slavery's
aftermath]{.underline}. In The Negro American Family, Du Bois writes
that the slave ship and the plantation revolutionized the black family
primarily by destroying kinship and negating conjugal relations.
Invariably the remedy proposed for this wounded kinship converged on the
figure of the (restored) husband--father as the primary breadwinner.
[The problem of black women's labor made apparent the gender
non-conformity of the black community, its supple and extended modes of
kinship]{.underline}, its queer domesticity, promiscuous sociality and
loose intimacy, and its serial and fluid conjugal relations. The "lax
moral relations, promiscuity, easy marriage and easy separation," which
Du Bois identified as the consequences of slavery, continued in the
aftermath of emancipation, extending the plantation to the city.
["Plantations holdovers,"]{.underline} to his dismay, [shaped life in
the emergent ghettoes of northern cities. The ghetto became the third
matrix of black death and dispossession, after the slave ship and the
plantation, and anticipating the prison]{.underline}.9 The urban
enclosure produced another revolution of black intimate life, another
rupture in the social history of the Negro.[10 Mothers and wives and
daughters were forced into unskilled and low-paid work, with the
overwhelming majority confined to labor as domestics. **Black women
served as the primary breadwinners in households that bore no
resemblance to the patriarchal nuclear family.**]{.underline} These
black laboring women troubled gender conventions by being "outfitted
like men," as was the case with their enslaved mothers and grandmothers.
[The independence granted by wages, even low wages, made them less
willing to marry or live with men unable to provide and granted them a
degree of sexual autonomy that made Du Bois shudder. He longed for a
future where the "betrayed girl mothers of the Black Belt," while
retaining their economic independence, would be transformed into
virtuous wives]{.underline} and married mothers. [The continuities
between slavery and freedom were underwritten by black women's domestic
labor. Their "success or frustrations in influencing the character of
domestic labor," writes Tera Hunter, "would define how meaningful
freedom would be."]{.underline}11 Slave women working as domestic
laborers in white households experienced forms of violence and sexual
exploitation that troubled simple distinctions between the privileges of
the house and the brutalities of the field. [Nowhere was the
heterogeneity or discontinuity or instability of the category gender
more apparent than in the plantation household. No uniform or shared
category of gender included the mistress and the enslaved. The white
household]{.underline}, as Thavolia Gylmph documents in Out of the House
of Bondage, [was a space of violence and brutality for the black women
forced to serve as housekeepers, caretakers, nannies]{.underline}, and
wet-nurses[. The domestic space, as much as the field, defined their
experience of enslavement and the particular vulnerabilities of the
captive body]{.underline}; and it continued to define the very narrow
horizon and limited opportunities available to black women in the first
decades of the 20th century. [Black women regularly complained about
being forced to labor as domestics. Domestic work carried the taint of
slavery. While black women's physical and affective labors were central
to the reproduction and security of the white household, their own lives
and families remained at risk. As free workers in the North and South,
black women continued to labor as poorly paid workers in white
households, tended and cared for white families, endured the exhaustion
and the boredom part and parcel of caring for children, cooking,
cleaning, and servicing the lives of others.]{.underline} In northern
cities like Philadelphia and New York, the overwhelming majority of
black women were confined to domestic and service labor. [Besides the
arduous toil that characterized this work, black women experienced great
isolation and were vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation by the
men of the household]{.underline}. While social reformers and
Progressive intellectuals encouraged domestic work as a form of moral
tutelage and training, [black women knew first-hand that they were safer
in the streets and the tenements of the ghetto than in white homes.
Domestic work subjected them to forms of intimate violence as well as
exploitation as low-wage workers. The systematic violence needed to
conscript black women's domestic labor after slavery required locking
them out of all other sectors of the labor market]{.underline}, a
condition William Patterson described as economic genocide. Race riots,
the enclosure of the ghetto, the vertical order of human life, and the
forms of value and debt promulgated through emergent forms of racism,
what Sarah Haley terms "Jim Crow modernity," made it impossible for
black women to escape the white household[. As domestic workers, black
women were conscripted to a role that required them to care for and
replenish the needs of the white household, and tend to the daily
activities necessary for its maintenance. **They were forced to perform
the affective and communicative labor necessary for the sustenance of
white families at the expense of their own; as surrogates, they were
required to mother children who held their children in
contempt**]{.underline}; to cook, clean, and comfort white men enabling
them to go out into the world as productive laborers; [and submit to
intimate relations with husbands and sons and brothers or be raped by
them---you cannot choose what you cannot refuse. In this labor of
service to the white household, the domestic worker struggled to enable
the survival of her own. Her lover, her spouse, and her kin depend on
this labor for their subsistence, as does her community. As a
consequence, she comes to enjoy a position that is revered and reviled,
essential to the endurance of black social life and, at the same time,
blamed for its destruction. The care extracted from her to tend the
white household is taken at the cost of her own. **She is the best nanny
and the worst mother.** Yet this labor remains marginal or neglected in
the narratives of black insurgency, resistance, and
refusal.]{.underline}

#### The plantation is the belly of the world.

**Hartman 16** (Sadiya, "The Belly of the World: A Note on Black Women's
Labors," Souls, 6/1/16,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10999949.2016.1162596)//MLM

[The slave ship is a womb/abyss. **The plantation is the belly of the
world**]{.underline}. Partus sequitur ventrem---[the child follows the
belly]{.underline}. The master dreams of future increase. [The modern
world follows the belly. Gestational language has been key to describing
the world-making and world-breaking capacities of racial
slavery.]{.underline} What it created and what it destroyed has been
explicated by way of gendered figures of conception, birth, parturition,
and severed or negated maternity. [To be a slave is to be "excluded from
the prerogatives of birth." The mother's only claim---to transfer her
dispossession to the child. The material relations of sexuality and
reproduction defined black women's historical experiences as laborers
and shaped the character of their refusal of and resistance to
slavery]{.underline}.1 [The theft, regulation and destruction of black
women's sexual and reproductive capacities would also define the
afterlife of slavery. Most often when the productive labor of the slave
comes into view, it is as a category absent gender and sexual
differentiation]{.underline}. In two of the greatest works of the black
radical tradition, W.E.B. Du Bois's Black Reconstruction and C.L.R.
James's Black Jacobins, the agency of the enslaved becomes legible as
politics, rather than crime or destruction, at the moment slaves are
transformed into black workers and revolutionary masses fashioned along
the lines of the insurgent proletariat. However, [representing the slave
through the figure of the worker (albeit unwaged and unfree), obscures
as much as it reveals, making it difficult to distinguish the
constitutive elements of slavery as a mode of power, violence,
dispossession and accumulation or to attend to the forms of gendered and
sexual violence that enable these processes. In Black Reconstruction,
women's sexual and reproductive labor is critical in accounting for the
violence and degradation of slavery, yet this labor falls outside of the
heroic account of the black worker and the general strike. Black women,
too, refused the conditions of work on the plantation, and Du Bois notes
their presence among the "army of fugitives" rushing away from the
fields. Yet, in the shift from the fugitive to the striking worker, the
female slave becomes a minor figure. Neither "the potentialities for the
future" represented by the fugitive nor the text engendered by flight
and refusal and furnished for abolition idealists embraced her
labors.]{.underline}2 [Marriage and protection rather than sexual
freedom and reproductive justice were the only ways conceived to redress
her wrongs, or remedy the "wound dealt to \[her\] reputation as a human
being." The sexual violence and reproduction characteristic of enslaved
women's experience fails to produce a radical politics of
liberation]{.underline} or a philosophy of freedom. Black women's labors
have not been easy to reckon with conceptually. [Feminist
thinkers]{.underline}, following the path cleared by Angela Davis's
groundbreaking essay "Reflections of the Black Woman's Role in the
Community of Slaves," [have considered the significance of gender,
sexuality and reproduction in defining the constitutive relations of
slavery and the modes of its violence.3 It has proven difficult, if not
impossible, to assimilate black women's domestic labors and reproductive
capacities within narratives of the black worker, slave rebellion,
maroonage, or black radicalism, even as this labor was critical to the
creation of value, the realization of profit and the accumulation of
capital. It has been no less complicated to imagine the future produced
by such labors as anything other than monstrous]{.underline}. Certainly
we know that enslaved women fled the plantation, albeit not in as great
numbers as men; poisoned slaveholders; plotted resistance; dreamed of
destroying the master and his house; utilized abortifacients rather than
reproduce slaves; practiced infanticide rather than sentence their
children to social death, the auction block, and the master's bed;
exercised autonomy in suicidal acts; gave birth to children as testament
to an abiding knowledge of freedom contrary to every empirical index of
the plantation; and yearned for radically different ways of being in the
world. So where exactly does the sex drudge, recalcitrant domestic,
broken mother, or sullen wet-nurse fit into the scheme of the general
strike? [If the general strike is a placeholder for political
aspirations that Du Bois struggles to name, how does the character of
the slave female's refusal augment the text of black radicalism? Is it
at all possible to imagine her as the paradigmatic slave or as the
representative black worker? Reproductive labor]{.underline}, as the
scholars Hortense Spillers, Jennifer Morgan, Dorothy Roberts, Alyss
Weinbaum, and Neferti Tadiar note, [is central to thinking about the
gendered afterlife of slavery and global capitalism.4 Yet attending to
the status of black women's labors has confounded our conceptual
categories and thrown our critical lexicon into crisis. On the slave
ship, captive women were accounted for as quantities of greater and
lesser mass, and the language of units and complete cargo eclipsed that
of the subject,]{.underline} the person or individual. The "anomalous
intimacy of cargo," according to Stephanie Smallwood, represented a new
social formation. Those African persons in Middle Passage, writes
Spillers, were "literally suspended in the oceanic." They were
"culturally unmade." "[Under these conditions one is neither female, nor
male, as both subjects are taken into account as
quantities]{.underline}."5 For Spillers, the categories of flesh and
body are deployed to describe the mutilation, dismemberment, and exile
of captivity and enslavement. [Flesh provides the primary narrative
rather than gendered subject positions. The flesh is produced by the
violence of racial slavery and yet it brings into view a new mode of
relation.]{.underline}

#### The 1ac misunderstands how the black body is positioned -- they advocate for dismantling the house boundaries that keep one literally and figuratively in place. Blackness is a site of dereliction -- a life marked by disorientation the affirmative notion of creating cognitive maps for alternative universes only function on the parasitic relationship to blackness within its structuring position 

**Wilderson 11** ("The Vengeance of Vertigo: Aphasia and Abjection in
the Political Trials of Black Insurgents" (Frank; Prof of African
American Studies at UC Irvine) \*edited for gendered language

With only small arms and crude explosives at their disposal, with little
of nothing in the way of logistical support,(3) with no liberated zone
to claim or reclaim, and with no more than a vague knowledge that there
were a few hundred other insurgents scattered throughout the U.S.
operating in largely uncoordinated and decentralized units,(4) the BLA
launched 66 operations(5) against the largest police state in the world.
Vertigo must have seized them each time they clashed with agents of a
nuclear-weapons regime with three million troops in uniform, a regime
that could put 150,000 new police on the streets in any given year, and
whose ordinary White citizens frequently deputize themselves in the name
of law and order. **[Subjective vertigo]{.underline}**, no doubt: [**a**
dizzying **sense that one is** moving or **spinning in an otherwise
stationary world**, a vertigo brought on by a clash of grossly
asymmetrical forces]{.underline}. There are suitable analogies, for this
kind of vertigo must have also seized Native Americans who launched the
AIM's occupation of Wounded Knee, and FALN insurgents who battled the
FBI. Subjective vertigo is vertigo of the event. [But **the sensation
that one is not simply spinning in an otherwise stable environment, that
one's environment is perpetually unhinged stems from a relationship to
violence that cannot be analogized. This** **is**]{.underline} called
[**objective vertigo, a life constituted by disorientation** rather than
a life interrupted by disorientation. This is structural as opposed to
performative violence. Black subjectivity is a crossroads where
vertigoes meet, the intersection of performative and structural
violence.]{.underline} Elsewhere I have argued that **[the Black is a
sentient being though not a Human being.]{.underline}** [The Black's and
the Human's disparate relationship to violence is at the heart of this
failure of incorporation and analogy. **The Human suffers contingent
violence**, violence that kicks in **when \[they\] s/he resists** (or is
perceived to resist) the disciplinary discourse of capital and/or
Oedipus. But **Black peoples' subsumption by violence is a paradigmatic
necessity**, not just a performative contingency. **To be constituted by
and disciplined by violence,** to be gripped simultaneously by
subjective and objective vertigo, **is indicative of a political
ontology which is radically different from** the political ontology of a
sentient **being** who is **constituted by discourse and disciplined by
violence when \[they\] s/he breaks with the ruling discursive
code**s.]{.underline}(6) When we begin to assess revolutionary armed
struggle in this comparative context, we find that [Human
revolutionaries (workers, women, gays and lesbians, post-colonial
subjects) suffer subjective vertigo when they meet the state's
disciplinary violence with the revolutionary violence of the subaltern;
but they are spared objective vertigo.]{.underline} This is [because
**the most disorienting aspects of their lives** are induced by the
struggles that **arise from intra-Human conflicts over competing
conceptual frameworks and** disputed **cognitive maps**,]{.underline}
such as the American Indian Movement's demand for the return of Turtle
Island vs. the U.S.'s desire to maintain territorial integrity, or the
Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional's (FALN) demand for Puerto Rican
independence vs. the U.S.'s desire to maintain Puerto Rico as a
territory. [**But** for the Black, as **for the slave, there are no
cognitive maps, no conceptual frameworks of suffering and dispossession
which are analogic with** the myriad **maps and frameworks which explain
the dispossession of Human subalterns**\.....]{.underline}Many pacifist
scholars and activists consider the strategies and tactics of armed
revolutionaries in First World countries to be short-sighted bursts of
narcissism.xvii What pacifist detractors forget, however, is that for
Gramsci, the strategy of a War of Position is one of commandeering civic
and political spaces one trench at a time in order to turn those spaces
into pedagogic locales for the dispossessed; and this process is one
which combines peaceful as well as violent tactics as it moves the
struggle closer to an all-out violent assault on the state. The BLA and
their White revolutionary co-defendants may have been better Gramscians
than those who critique them through the lens of Gramsci. Their tactics
(and by tactics I mean armed struggle as well as courtroom performances)
were no less effective at winning hearts and minds than candle light
vigils and "orderly" protests. If the end-game of Gramscian struggle is
the isolation and emasculation of the ruling classes' ensemble of
questions, as a way to alter the structure of feeling of the
dispossessed so that the next step, the violent overthrow of the state,
doesn't feel like such a monumental undertaking, then I would argue the
pedagogic value of retaliating against police by killing one of them
each time they kill a Black person, the expropriating of bank funds from
armored cars in order to further finance armed struggle as well as
community projects such as acupuncture clinics in the Bronx where drug
addicts could get clean, and the bombing of major centers of U.S.
commerce and governance, followed by trials in which the defendants used
the majority of the trial to critique the government rather than plead
their case, have as much if not more pedagogic value than peaceful
protest. In other words, if not for the "pathological pacifism"
(Churchill) which clouds political debate and scholarly analysis there
would be no question that the BLA, having not even read Gramsci,xviii
were among the best Gramscian theorists the U.S. has ever
known[.]{.underline} But though the BLA were great Gramscian theorists,
they could not become Gramscian subjects. The political character of
**[one's actions is inextricably bound to the political status of one's
subjectivity]{.underline}**; and while this status goes without saying
for Gilbert and Clark, it is always in question for Balagoon and
Bukhari. \[34\] **[How does one calibrate the gap between objective
vertigo and the need to be productive as a Black revolutionary? What is
the political significance of restoring balance to the inner
ear?]{.underline}** Is tyranny of closure the only outcome of such
interventions or could restoration of the Black subject's inner ear,
while failing at the level of conceptual framework, provide something
necessary, though intangible, at the level of blood and sweat political
activism? These unanswered questions haunt this article. Though I have
erred in this article on the side of paradigm as opposed to praxis, and
cautioned against assuming that we know or can know what the harvest of
their sacrifice was, I believe we are better political thinkers---if not
actors---as a result of what they did with their bodies, even if we
still don't know what to do with ours. \*

#### The alternative is an embracement of pathology that is a disruption of the dialectics that constitute the very anti-black grammar of the world that maintains its coherency 

**Sexton '11** (Jared, The Social Life of Social Death: On
Afro-Pessimism and Black Optimism, York University (Toronto, Canada)
Issue 5 (Fall/Winter 2011)pg 15-28) B.M.

To interrogate "the *racial* discourses of life philosophy" is to
demonstrate that the question of life cannot be pried apart from that
thorniest of problems: "the problem of the Negro as a problem for
thought," that dubious and doubtless "fact of blackness," or what I will
call, in yet another register, the social life of social death.vi This
is as much an inquiry about the nature of nature as it is about the
politics of nature and the nature of politics; in other words, it is
metapolitical no less than it is metaphysical. In charting the
intellectual prehistory of the theorization of biopolitics, Jones also
forecasts---and reframes---the biotechnological anxiety or euphoria
provoked by the prospect of engineered life in our own time *and* the
way that prospect is powerfully associated with notions of social,
economic, and political possibility. Reading Deleuze and Guattari,
Foucault or Agamben cannot remain the same, nor should it, to the degree
that we have engaged the tragic-comic complexities of existence in
black. Moten might follow, at another pace, the long qualification of
vitalism that Jones accomplishes in her text, just as he might read
skeptically the implications of an affirmative biopolitics. The question
that remains, beyond the immediate negotiation even as it continues to
loop back to it, is whether a politics, which is also to say an
aesthetics, that affirms (social) life can avoid the thanatological dead
end if it does not will its own (social) death. Marriott might call
this, with Fanon, "[**the need to affirm affirmation through
negation\...not as a moral imperative\...but as a psychopolitical
necessity**"]{.underline} (Marriott 2007: 273 fn. 9).vii \...\...
Elsewhere, in a discussion of Du Bois on the study of black folk, Gordon
restates an existential phenomenological conception of the antiblack
world developed across his first several books: "Blacks here suffer the
phobogenic reality posed by the spirit of racial seriousness. In effect,
they more than symbolize or signify various social pathologies---they
become them. [In our antiblack world, blacks *are*
pathology]{.underline}" (Gordon 2000: 87). This conception would seem to
support Moten's contention that even much radical black studies
scholarship sustains the association of blackness with a certain sense
of decay and thereby fortifies and extends the interlocutory life of
widely accepted political common sense. In fact, it would seem that
Gordon deepens the already problematic association to the level of
identity. And yet, this is precisely what Gordon argues is the value and
insight of Fanon: he fully accepts the definition of himself as
pathological as it is imposed by a world that knows *itself* through
that imposition, rather than remaining in a reactive stance that insists
on the (temporal, moral, etc.) heterogeneity between a self and an imago
originating in culture. Though it may appear counterintuitive, or rather
because it is counterintuitive, this acceptance or affirmation is
active; it is a willing or willingness, in other words, to pay whatever
social costs accrue to being black, to inhabiting blackness, to living a
black social life under the shadow of social death. This is not an
accommodation to the dictates of the antiblack world. **[The affirmation
of blackness, which is to say an affirmation of pathological being, is a
refusal to distance oneself from blackness in a valorization of minor
differences that bring one closer to health, to life, or to
sociality]{.underline}**. Fanon writes in the first chapter of *Black
Skin, White Masks*, "The Black Man and Language": "A Senegalese who
learns Creole to pass for Antillean is a case of alienation. The
Antilleans who make a mockery out of him are lacking in judgment" (Fanon
2008: 21). In a world structured by the twin axioms of white superiority
and black inferiority, of white existence and black nonexistence, a
world structured by a negative categorical imperative--- "above all,
don't be black" (Gordon 1997: 63)---**[in this world, the zero degree of
transformation is the turn toward blackness, a turn toward the shame, as
it were, that "resides in the idea that 'I am thought of as less than
human'"]{.underline}** (Nyong'o 2002: 389).**xiv [In this we might
create a transvaluation of pathology itself, something like an embrace
of pathology without pathos]{.underline}**\..... [To speak of black
social life *and* black social death, black social life *against* black
social death, black social life *as* black social death, **black social
life in black social death**]{.underline}---all of this is to find
oneself in the midst of an argument that is also a profound agreement,
an agreement that takes shape in (between) *meconnaissance* and
(dis)belief. Black optimism is not the negation of the negation that is
afro-pessimism, just as black social life does not negate black social
death by inhabiting it and vitalizing it. A living death is as much a
death as it is a living. [Nothing in afro-pessimism suggests that there
is no black (social) life, only that black life is not social life in
the universe formed by the codes of state and civil society, of citizen
and subject, of nation and culture, of people and place, of history and
heritage, of all the things that colonial society has in common with the
colonized, of all that capital has in common with labor---the modern
world system. Black life is not lived in the world that the world lives
in, but it is lived underground, in outer space]{.underline}. This is
agreed. That is to say, what Moten asserts against afro-pessimism is a
point already affirmed by afro-pessimism, is, in fact, one of the most
polemical dimensions of afro-pessimism as a project: namely, **[that
black life is not social, or rather that black life is *lived* in social
*death*. Double emphasis, on lived and on death.]{.underline}** That's
the whole point of the enterprise at some level. It is all about the
implications of this agreed- upon point where arguments (should) begin,
but they cannot (yet) proceed.

### ALT SOLVENCY

#### The alt solves the aff but not the other way around -- only thru staying with the debt can we live and love in mutual solidarity beyond accounting and exchange

**Harney and Moten 13** \[The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black
Study, Minor Compositions, p 156-158 //tjb\]

STEFANO: Given that, [when you start to talk about this other kind of
debt, you're talking about a history of aesthetics, a history of love, a
history of organization, it's not merely about what you want to abolish
-- which is credit -- but it's also about what you want to live in and
how you want to live in it.]{.underline} [And that's because the real
debt, the big debt, the wealth that Marx is talking about, is precisely
that: it's wealth.]{.underline} So, you want to figure out some way that
that wealth can be enjoyed. And that's [not by managing it, because
managing it is the first step to accounting for it, attributing it or
distributing it]{.underline}. [It's about developing some way of being
with each other]{.underline}, and of not thinking that that requires the
mediation of politics. But, it requires elaboration, [it requires
improvisation, it requires a kind of rehearsal.]{.underline} It requires
things. It's just that [it doesn't require accounting or management. It
requires study.]{.underline} FRED: Man, [I remember being little, being
in Arkansas with my grandparents. My grandfather would give somebody a
ride like 80 miles from our little town to another little town in his
little 1969 green Buick Skylark]{.underline}. And [there was this whole
ritual process that would occur]{.underline}, and it had a couple of
different parts to it. One part would be that somebody, [my grandpa,
would give you a ride, and before they'd get out of the car, the person
would say, "how much do I owe you?" And he'd say, "nothin." Sometimes
he'd feign a kind of, "why would you even ask me some shit like that?"
They'd come a whole way just for a certain set of performances. "It
don't mean nothin. Man, get out of this car," or something like that.
But, if somebody got out of the car without asking that shit\... He'd be
like, "son, don't be like that." You have to acknowledge.]{.underline}
STEFANO: And [you have to rehearse, because you're involved in the
rehearsal of some other form of being in debt together.]{.underline}
When we say that we don't want management, it doesn't mean we don't want
anything, that it just sits there and everything's fine. There's
something to be done, but it's performative, it's not managerial. FRED:
And the other part of it, which was just as important, was [every once
in awhile, if you're giving somebody a ride or if they gave you a ride,
instead of asking how "much do I owe you?", you would just take some
money out of your pocket and say, "put some gas in the car," and get out
of the car.]{.underline} See the interplay between those two things. So,
**[the reason why you asked somebody, "how much do I owe you?" is so
that you could be engaged in this ritual process of basically disavowing
the very idea of 'owe.']{.underline}** STEFANO: Yeah, exactly. So that
[you begin to practice, improvise the relationship between necessity and
freedom, not on the grounds of owing and credit, but on the grounds of
unpayable debt.]{.underline} FRED: Yep, most of the while, when you had
some money, it wouldn't be a discussion. You would just say, "here put
some gas in the car," and get out, leaving some money on the seat.
STEFANO: There's a necessity moment in it, but it's in the context of
the freedom, rather than the other way around, and this is the only way
it could be when we think of ability and need freed of the standpoint
and then [this is not a distributional politics anymore but an
experiment in letting yourself discover new needs in your abilities and
new abilities in your needs in the rhythm of, not against, the general
antagonism, performed between the two and amongst the many.]{.underline}
FRED: Yeah, and this is why, for me, see I was looking at that, and it
was illogical, if you want to call it that, but it was also
performative. For me, I'm not saying that's the only form that study
takes, but any notion of study that doesn't acknowledge that form of it
is not the study that I'm interested in. STEFANO: [Where you find the
abolition of credit you find study. But you can't call for the abolition
of credit like you hear calls for the abolition of debt because the call
to abolish credit is already always going all, it is a call that enacts,
that is enacted. In other words, **we don't need anything to get in debt
together**.]{.underline} We have already a superabundance of mutual debt
we don't want pay, we don't want to pay, so what why would we call for
anything? But we can join in this plenitude and its everyday
performance. Moreover by joining perhaps we avoid some of what credit
brings and what calls for debt forgiveness bring as unwanted results,
from uplift to settlement.

### A DIFFERENT ALT

#### The alternative is an elaboration of care and love that begins with the world we actually want to live in. Rather than the politics of debunking as an end that characterize the aff, we are more preoccupied with responding to one another in service of how to build sociality in a different way. 

**Harney and Moten 13** \[The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black
Study, Minor Compositions, p 120-121 //tjb\]

STEFANO: Yeah, I feel that's true. What I think is that each one is a
different way to get at a similar set of questions, to think about the
general antagonism, to think about blackness, to think about the un-
dercommons. I think [the impulse for me and Fred is always to try and
move towards the stuff that we like, and to move towards the mode of
living that we like]{.underline}. We know that [sometimes that involves
moving through certain kinds of critique of what's holding us back. But,
for me, each time, what's going on is that I'm trying to elaborate a
different mode of living together with others, of being with others, not
just with other people but with other things and other kinds of
senses]{.underline}. At one point, for me anyway, I felt very strongly
that this kind of policy world was emerging everywhere -- and I wanted
to talk with Fred about [how to find our stuff again amidst all this
kind of policy work in which everybody seemed from every spot at any
moment to be making policy]{.underline}. I had this image in my head of
[a kind of return to a world in which every self-determined individual
had the right to make brutal policy on the spot for every person who was
not self- determined, which essentially is a colonial or slave situation
-- and the kind of ubiquity of policy, which all of a sudden, didn't
emanate any- more just from government but from fucking policy shops in
every university, and from independent policy shops, and from bloggers,
etc. These policy people to me are like night riders.]{.underline} So, I
felt at that moment it was necessary to deal with it in terms of, [what
would you say is going on that occasioned that kind of frenzied attack,
this total mobilisation of the 'fixed'? What provoked this? That's why
we ended up talking about planning]{.underline}. But there's also a part
where Fred is very directly able to address blackness in a piece. So, we
were able to start with something that we were feeling was an
elaboration of our mode of living, our inherited black radical
tradition. Then, that piece ends up with [a kind of caution around
governance.]{.underline} At least from my point of view, I'm always
approaching Fred, hanging out with Fred, to say, [we know that there are
things we like, so how can we elaborate them this time, not just for
each other but also for other people, to say to others let's keep
fighting, keep doing our thing]{.underline}. So, it's true that [it
isn't an argument that builds]{.underline}. To me, [it's picking up
different toys to see if we can get back to what we're really interested
in.]{.underline} Not to say that that doesn't change. I have a richer
understanding of social life than I did a few years ago. [When I started
working with Fred, social life, to me, had a lot to do with friendship,
and it had a lot to do with refusal -- refusal to do certain kinds of
things. And then gradually I got more and more interested in this term,
'preservation,]{.underline}' where I started to think about, "well,
[**refusal's something that we do because of them, what do we do because
of ourselves?" Recently, I've started to think more about elaborations
of care and love.** So, my social world is getting bigger with our work.
But, **each piece for me is still another way to come at what we love
and what's keeping us from what we love. So, it isn't in that sense a
scientific investigation that starts at one end and finishes at the
other end.**]{.underline} FRED: It's funny, [this ubiquity of policy
making, the constant deputisation of academic laborers into the
apparatuses of police power.]{.underline} And they are like night
riders, paddy rollers, [everybody's on patrol, trying to capture the
ones who are trying to get out -- especially themselves, trying to
capture their own fugitivity.]{.underline} [That's actually the first
place at which policy is directed.]{.underline} I think that [a huge
part of it has to do simply with]{.underline}, let's call it, **[a
certain reduction of intellectual life -- to reduce study into critique,
and then at the same time, a really, really horrific, brutal reduction
of critique to debunking, which operates under the general assumption
that naturalised academic misery loves company in its isolation, like
some kind of warped communal alienation in which people are tied
together not by blood or a common language but by the bad feeling they
compete over.]{.underline}** And so, what ends up happening is [you get
a whole lot of people who]{.underline}, as Stefano was suggesting,
[spend a whole lot of time thinking about stuff that they don't want to
do, thinking about stuff that they don't want to be, rather than
beginning with, and acting out, what they want.]{.underline}

[In order to derail the U.S.-Russia partnership, the Lobby has sought to
revive the image of Russias as an enemy of the United States. The
Russophobic groups have exploited important differences between the two
countries' historical self-perceptions, presenting those differences as
incompatible]{.underline}. 1. ContestedHistory Two versions of history
[The story of the Cold War as told from the U.S. perspective is about
American ideas of Western-style democracy as rescued from the Soviet
threat of totalitarian communism]{.underline}. Although scholars and
politicians disagreed over the methods of responding to the Soviet
threat, they rarely questioned their underlying assumptions about
history and freedom.1 It therefore should not come as surprise that many
in the United States have interpreted the end of the Cold War as a
victory of the Western freedom narrative. [Celebrating the Soviet
Union's "grand failure"---as Zbigniew Brzezinski put it2---the American
discourse assumed that from now on there would be little resistance to
freedom's worldwide progression]{.underline}. When Francis Fukuyama
offered his bold summary of these optimistic feelings and asserted in a
famous passage that "what we may be witnessing is not just the end of
the Cold War . . . but the end of history as such,"3 he meant to convey
the disappearance of an alternative to the familiar idea of free- dom,
or "the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form
of human government."4 [In Russia, however, the Cold War story has been
mainly about sover- eignty and independence, rather than Western-style
liberalism. To many Russians it is a story of freedom from colonization
by the West and of pre- serving important attributes of sovereign
statehood. In a world where neo- colonialism and cultural imperialism
are potent forces, the idea of freedom as independence continues to have
strong international appeal and remains a powerful alternative to the
notion of liberal democracy]{.underline}. Russians formulated the
narrative of independence centuries ago, as they successfully withstood
external invasions from Napoleon to Hitler. The defeat of the Nazi
regime was important to the Soviets because it legit- imized their
claims to continue with the tradition of freedom as inde- pendence. The
West's unwillingness to recognize the importance of this legitimizing
myth in the role of communist ideology has served as a key reason for
the Cold War.5 Like their Western counterparts, the Soviets were
debating over methods but not the larger assumptions that defined their
struggle. This helps to understand why Russians could never agree with
the Western interpretation of the end of the Cold War. [What they find
missing from the U.S. narrative is the tribute to Russia's ability to
defend its free- dom from expansionist ambitions of larger powers. The
Cold War too is viewed by many Russians as a necessarily defensive
response to the West's policies, and it is important that even while
occupying Eastern Europe, the Soviets never celebrated the occupation,
emphasizing instead the war vic- tory]{.underline}.6 [The Russians
officially admitted "moral responsibility" and apolo- gized for the
Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia]{.underline}.7 They may
be prepared to fully recognize the postwar occupation of Eastern Europe,
but only in the context of the two sides' responsibility for the Cold
War. Russians also find it offensive that Western VE Day celebrations
ignore the crucial contribution of Soviet troops, even though none of
the Allies, as one historian put it, "paid dearer than the Soviet Union
for the victory. Forty Private Ivans fell in battle to every Private
Ryan."8 Victory over Nazi Germany constitutes, as another Russian wrote,
"the only undisputable foundation of the national myth."9 Toward an
agreeable history If the two sides are to build foundations for a future
partnership, the two historical narratives must be bridged. First, it is
important to recognize the difficulty of negotiating a common meaning of
freedom and accept that the idea of freedom may vary greatly across
nations. The urge for freedom may be universal, but its social content
is a specific product of national his- tories and local circumstances.
For instance, the American vision of democracy initially downplayed the
role of elections and emphasized selection by merit or meritocracy.
Under the influence of the Great Depression, the notion of democracy
incorporated a strong egalitarian and poverty-fighting component, and it
was not until the Cold War--- and not without its influence---that
democracy has become associated with elections and pluralistic
institutions.10 Second, it is essential to acknowledge the two nations'
mutual respon- sibility for the misunderstanding that has resulted in
the Cold War. A his- torically sensitive account will recognize that
both sides were thinking in terms of expanding a territorial space to
protect their visions of security. While the Soviets wanted to create a
buffer zone to prevent a future attack from Germany, the Americans
believed in reconstructing the European continent in accordance with
their ideas of security and democracy. A mutual mistrust of the two
countries' leaders exacerbated the situation, making it ever more
difficult to prevent a full-fledged political confronta- tion. Western
leaders had reason to be suspicious of Stalin, who, in his turn, was
driven by the perception of the West's greed and by betrayals from the
dubious Treaty of Versailles to the appeasement of Hitler in Munich.
Arrangements for the post--World War II world made by Britain, the USSR,
and the United States proved insufficient to address these deep- seated
suspicions. In addition, most Eastern European states created as a
result of the Versailles Treaty were neither free nor democratic and
collab- orated with Nazi Germany in its racist and expansionist
policies. The European post--World War I security system was not working
prop- erly, and it was only a matter of time before it would have to be
trans- formed. Third, if an agreeable historical account is to emerge,
it would have to accept that the end of the Cold War was a product of
mutually beneficial negotiations.11 Without the series of negotiations
and the committed leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, and
George Bush, the Cold War would not have ended when it did. The fact
that Gorbachev lost control of reforms at home ought to be treated as
separate from his for- eign policy accomplishments and not as something
that validates the American hegemonic narrative. According to this
narrative, a generous United States spared Russia "the humiliation of a
total defeat and gra- ciously allowed Moscow to continue to play the
role of a major power even as its economy contracted and its military
deteriorated."12 In reality nobody won the Cold War, as a result of
military or political pressures. **[If anything, both the Americans and
the Russians lost it, because in process of their confrontation, they
developed what Gary Hart called "the one- dimensional Cold War
understanding of security---military protection from and deterrence of .
. . missile attack" as opposed to a more complex definition of
insecurity in a complex world]{.underline}**.13 Preoccupation with a war
also strengthened militaristic attitudes in society and undermined
domestic foundations for peaceful democratic development.14 It is going
to take a new generation of committed leaders to negotiate a better end-
ing to the Cold War and learn how to defend their national interests in
a mutually productive way. 2. The End to the First and the Second Cold
War "We won the Cold War": Russia as a defeated power [As Gorbachev's
hopes to put the world on path to denuclearization and strengthen the
United Nations failed to materialize,15 the American hege- monic
discourse gained momentum]{.underline}. The fact that the Warsaw Pact
disap- peared, while NATO persisted, allowed many to claim victory in
the Cold War. Post-Soviet Russia emerged as the sick man of Eurasia with
severe domestic problems, which served to reinforce the triumphalism of
American elites. It was in this context that George H. W. Bush
proclaimed in his 1992 State of the Union message that the United States
had "won" the Cold War, which only legitimized to the highest level the
already pow- erful policy discourse. Yet what to Bush was more of a
political speech in the preelection season was a policy blueprint to
Bill Clinton. It was the Clinton administration that really entrenched
the rhetoric of victorious thinking by drawing the analogy between
Russia and the defeat of Germany and Japan in World War II. ["We were
the victor nation, they were the defeated nation, and therefore they
should be supplicant and subordi- nate to the United States," wrote
Stephen Cohen who believes that such thinking "was a terrible mistake."
He goes on to say, "That's not what hap- pened, without Gorbachev the
Cold War would not have ended, so Russia deserves as much credit as the
United States."]{.underline}16 **[Although the Russian contribution to
the Cold War end was crucial, the treatment the new Russia's government
received was that of a defeated power, and was without Marshall
Plan-like assistance. Russian leaders expected a considerable package of
financial assistance from Western powers particularly because both
President Boris Yeltsin and his foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev
committed themselves to transforming Russia into a Western
power]{.underline}**. Russia was expected to follow American recom-
mendations regarding its political and economic transformation and for-
eign policy, but all programs of Western assistance served mostly to
encourage the destruction of the previous economic system. Rather than
developing social safety nets and rule of law in the process of
fundamen- tal structural transformation, the United States preferred to
build rela- tionships with the narrow and corrupt ruling elite.17 The
fact that the West-sponsored reform strategy did not help to facilitate
the transforma- tion was reflected, among other things, in the figures
of the overall capi- tal flight during 1992--99, which exceeded the
amount of financial assistance. According to Russia's official
statistics, the overall capital flight during that period was \$182
billion, whereas the amount of foreign assis- tance constituted \$174
billion.18 The so-called reformers in Russia were well aware of the
state of affairs and yet were unable to say no to Western "assistance."
Alongside its limited economic support, the Clinton administration was
simultaneously pursuing policies of containing Russia in a security
context. First, there was the expansion of NATO, which even the liberal-
minded Kozyrev saw as a "continuation, though by inertia, of a policy
aimed at containment of Russia."19 Many in Russia perceived the decision
largely as an attempt to fill the existing security vacuum by taking
advan- tage of Russia's weakness. The United States, as the most
powerful mem- ber of NATO, bears prime responsibility for the inadequate
policies toward Russia, although European leaders also contributed to
Russia's security isolation. Concerned with the country's lack of
democracy and its conduct of the Chechen war, they impeded Russia's
movement toward integration into Western European institutions. As a
result, the Russian-sought "Common Strategy of the EU on Russia"---an
elaborate document that formulated principles of relations with Russia
and made its integration dependent on progress in building democratic
and market institutions--- was only adopted in June 1999. By late 1993,
the pro-Western coalition in Russia was on the verge of disintegration.
The Russian leaders kept insisting that the United States' best choice
remained strategic partnership with Russia because of "a his- toric
opportunity to facilitate the formation of a democratic, open Russian
state and the transformation of an unstable, post-confrontational world
into a stable and democratic one."20 Yet Kozyrev, writing in the New
York Times, soon had to warn of "the chauvinistic new banners that flap
in the Washington wind." "In these confused days," he lamented, "we are
neither understood nor adequately supported by our natural friends and
allies in the West. . . . It appears that some Western politicians, in
Washington and elsewhere, envision Russia not as an equal partner but as
a junior partner. In this view a 'good Russian' is always a follower,
never a leader."21

#### Reject their Western-centric rhetoric of Russia and the East on face: such rhetoric has been weaponized historically to demean the East from the position of Western privilege while simultaneously justifying extractive colonialism and the expansion of liberal empire.

The Lobby's phobias of Russia's revival [Some of the people Kozyrev had
in mind aimed at keeping Russia con- fused, humiliated, and unable to
revive any components of its former great power identity and material
strength. Many in the West continued to mis- trust the former "red
menace" viewing it as threatening and barbaric]{.underline}. In the
first half of the 1990s, the Lobby challenged Western programs of
engaging Russia and assisting it---as limited as that assistance
was---with various aspects of its transformation. Zbigniew Brzezinski,
the former national security advisor to President Jimmy Carter, was
among the first to question the wisdom of pursuing what he called a
policy of idealistic opti- mism on the grounds of Russia's corruption
and still potent imperialist instincts.22 [As NATO was expanding toward
the East, it was Russia that was accused of "imperialist intentions" in
the former Soviet region. Brzezinski then proceeded to argue for the
U.S. control over the entire Eurasian con- tinent because it has most of
the world's resources and because "all the his- torical pretenders to
global power originated in Eur]{.underline}asia."23 This had to be
accomplished by strengthening the independence of non-Russian states,
fostering ties with China, and working to decentralize the Russian
state. Preempting possible objections from supporters of partnership
with Russia, the analyst made it clear that "if a choice must be made
between a larger Europe-Atlantic system and a better relationship with
Russia, the former must rank higher."24 Brzezinski also played a key
role in convincing President Clinton of the need to push forward with
NATO expansion against opposition from Russia, as well as many in the
American establishment. In alliance with the national security advisor
Tony Lake, he worked to satisfy the strong preferences of Eastern
European governments and build a network of support for the expansion.25
Conservative columnists, such as the New York Times' William Safire,
assisted Brzezinski by trumpeting the rationale of NATO enlargement.
Safire pursued the "window of opportunity" argument to override existing
opposition. "[We must extend the alliance membership for Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Baltic States and ultimately Ukraine,"
he argued, because "Russia is authoritarian at heart and expansionist by
habit."26 We must do it now, "while Russia is weak and preoccupied with
its own revival, and not later, when such a move would be an
insufferable provocation to a superpower."27 **Elaborating on the
"authoritarian at heart and expansionist by habit" point, Richard Pipes
provided the perspective of an academic and histo- rian. Writing in
Foreign Affairs, he reminded its readers about Russia's "heavy burden of
history" and failure to make "a clean break with its Soviet past."28
Pipes insisted that the problem extended even beyond the Soviet era, as
Russians "have to overcome not only the communist legacy but also that
of the czars and their partner, the Orthodox Church, which for cen-
turies collaborated in instilling in their subjects disrespect for law,
submis- sion to strong and willful authority, and hostility to the
West**]{.underline}."29 He then reiterated Brzezinski's points about
Russia's tendency to use its resources and military in the imperialist
fashion and concluded by cautioning against viewing the country as a
potential ally. Russia may still return as an enemy, the historian
wrote, "if those who guide its destiny, exploiting the political
inexperience and deep-seated prejudices of its people, once again aspire
to a glory to which they are not yet entitled."30 The second Cold War
end: Russia as a historic ally [The anti-Russian rhetoric continued and
was heightened further as Vladimir Putin was elected the country's
president. Republican members of the Lobby chose to exploit the
opportunity presented by the 2000 pres- idential campaign to denounce
the Clinton administration's foreign policy record and attack Russia as
"the world's most virulent kleptocracy]{.underline}."31 In a broader
debate on whether Russia had been lost, others laid the blame entirely
on the Russian national character. **[For example, Matthew Brzezinski,
the nephew of the former national security advisor argued that "no one
lost Russia but the Russians themselves," with their slavish "Slavic
soul" and their scheming thuggery.32]{.underline}** President George W.
Bush, however, saw things differently. Soon after 9/11, he and his
advisors characterized Russia as "a nation in hopeful tran- sition" and
"an important partner in the war on terror."33 Most impor- tantly, in
May 2002, the United States and Russia signed a joint declaration
stating "a qualitatively new foundation" in their relationship, and an
end to the era in which the two countries "saw each other as an enemy or
strate- gic threat." "We are partners and we will cooperate to advance
stability, security, and economic integration, and to jointly counter
global chal- lenges and to help resolve regional conflicts."34 The
thinking underlying the declaration amounted to the second abolishment
of the Cold War. Even if the new thinking was brought to existence by a
mutual threat, rather than jointly developed values, it signaled the end
of the principle of subordination and recognized the equality of Russia.
The new vision found its support in American society with 60 percent of
Americans view- ing Russia favorably and 55 percent thinking that Russia
would play an important role in the world in the next decade.35 The
level of support demonstrated by the public considerably limited the
Lobby's ability to act and promote anti-Russian stereotypes. In response
to the widely recog- nized threat of Islamic extremism, the Lobby could
not be as active and effective until around the first half of 2003. This
changed when Russia refused to go along with the United States on Iraq.

#### Internalizing threat constructions against Russia that we are exposed to in debate makes us more xenophobic, seeding new age McCarthyism, and worse political engagement that will just play into the Kremlin's hands.

'Russophobia' has become a charge as common as fascism in the
information war between Russia, Ukraine and the West. The accusation
brings to mind the tale of the boy who cried wolf. The fact that the
charge is levelled indiscriminately, doesn't make the wolves, (in this
case the 'russophobes\'), any less real. In fact, the Russian government
has been able to brilliantly co-opt public russophobia in the West in
order to conflate it with a much more specific phenomenon, one that I
like to call 'Kremlinphobia,' as a means of legitimising its policies at
home and, to a lesser extent, abroad. In order to understand how the
Kremlin uses anti-Russian sentiment for its own ends, first it's
important to distinguish between two stereotypes. The first is the
stereotyping of Russians by outsiders in both political and personal
contexts. The second is a particular strain of Russian national
mythology in which Russia is forever cast as an isolated victim,
martyred by predatory foreigners. Both these narratives are valid, with
roots stretching back into history. A brief history of russophobia
[Political russophobia as we understand it today might be said to have
begun with Napoleon, and enjoyed a long and distinguished pedigree
before the advent of the Cold War, which subsequently gave birth to most
of the popular stereotypes of Russians. Students of Russian history are
familiar with Marquis de Custine's sweeping characterisation of Russians
as brutal and stupid, and even such figures as John Maynard Keynes were
not above talking about the 'beastliness' allegedly inherent 'in Russian
nature.' As an American high school student --- born in Ukraine,
ethnically mostly Russian --- I was personally struck by how eminent
French-American historian Jacques Barzun could write brilliantly about
European culture in From Dawn to Decadence, yet managed to reduce Russia
to a couple of cruel caricatures, pretending as if the country and its
people had contributed nothing of value in the last five hundred years.
For a teenager, it was a bit like being told that you can't sit at the
cool kids' table at school --- in an overarching, civilisational
sense.]{.underline} As I grew up, I was made to understand that Russia
never enjoyed a Renaissance or an Enlightenment period. It developed
much more chaotically and erratically than Western countries. But the
idea that Russia is not a contributor to world culture (or, for that
matter, science) began to strike me as both laughable and politically
expedient. I began to notice that comparatively enlightened Western
culture still left room for 'acceptable' stereotypes. **[I began to
notice that comparatively enlightened Western culture still left room
for 'acceptable' stereotypes, particularly when a political situation
demanded it. Whether it was beastly, alcoholic Russians in ugly fur
hats, or the idea that one can bomb Muslim countries as a way of saving
helpless Muslim women from barbaric Muslim men, political expediency has
from time to time dictated that some groups can still be thought of as
inherently inferior]{.underline}**. On a personal level, the lazy
stereotyping of 'Russians' (a category that often extends to all former
Soviet peoples) can be no less hurtful and damaging than other readily
recognisable prejudices. Russophobia and sexism [**The Western male
fetish for Russian women is another manifestation of this type of
stereotyping. Russian women are regularly portrayed as sexually
available, helpless, and in need of being 'saved' from their abysmal
conditions by a foreign knight in shining armour (or, at the very least,
in a shiny Lexus) who always knows better than them.** Since the Ukraine
crisis began, I've struggled to explain to Western (male) colleagues how
difficult it has been to write about unfolding events while being
perceived explicitly as a 'Russian' woman. I may have a complicated,
multicultural background, but my Russian surname ensures that first
impressions of me are often based on stereotypes.]{.underline} When
you're perceived as a Russian woman who is writing or saying something
that your audience may not necessarily wish to hear, you're cast as a
KGB 'honeypot' at best and an evil 'whore' at worst, with all of the
rhetorical fallout, which such stereotypes inevitably bring out. 'Why
are you paying so much attention to trolls on the internet? Aren't you
being a little dramatic?' My male colleagues tell me when I complain
about online abuse. These trolls write that I ought to be gang-raped,
have my head shaved, and be marched through the streets. These trolls
write that I ought to be gang-raped, have my head shaved, and be marched
through the streets --- all because they don't appreciate some of my
views on the Ukraine crisis. That's why I pay attention. Because they
specifically use the threat of sexual violence as a way to shut me up.
Because as a woman I already live in constant fear of harassment
escalating into something far worse. Anything seen as objectionable in
my writing is presented as a part of my 'KGB agenda' or, conversely, as
evidence of the fact that I\'m, say, a 'Ukrainian slut;' and all of the
clichés about dangerous or overly sexualised Slavic women are
immediately trotted out. Playing the Kremlin's game The irony is that in
all of their incarnations, internet warriors crusading against 'evil
Russia' play directly into the Kremlin's hands. The flipside of historic
russophobia is the history of how authoritarianism in Russia justifies
itself by exaggerating a constant foreign threat. This perception of a
threat is not just based on the fact that both Napoleon and Hitler
invaded Russia, causing catastrophic, unthinkable losses. For example,
plenty of Russians will eagerly tell you that the bloody Russian
Revolution and ensuing Civil War were solely the fault of the Germans,
who supported Vladimir Lenin and delivered him to Russia like a
dangerous virus. While various historical mechanisms that fostered the
rise of Lenin should indeed be scrutinised, the idea that not a single
Russian can somehow be blamed for the bloody violence which followed is
ludicrous, but popular. Plenty of Russians will argue that the Stalinist
Terror was solely the fault of one man ---who was Georgian by the way,
so totally not one of us. They will remind you that it was Lenin and his
people who really laid the groundwork for repressions during the Stalin
era. Meanwhile, millions of supposedly nice, ordinary Russians who
dutifully denounced their friends and neighbours, sending them to their
deaths, will be ignored. Such a myopic view of history is made possible
by authoritarian leaders and their cheerleaders, who do a great job of
stereotyping the Russian people themselves. First of all, they
implicitly argue that Russians cannot possibly accept responsibility for
the bloody mistakes of their immediate historic past. Accepting
responsibility could lead to a more open, more tolerant society, and
that just wouldn't do. Better just to blame outsiders and keep the
post-traumatic stress of wars and repressions completely unresolved.
[The idea that Russians are noble savages, basically good yet just too
wild and crazy, is also a form of russophobia. Often propagated in state
media, the idea that Russians are noble savages, basically good yet just
too wild and crazy for anything but authoritarian leaders, is also a
form of russophobia. For sure, there is a multitude of economic and
historical rationales for Russia's continued love affair with
authoritarianism in various forms, but it has nothing to do with
anything that is 'inherent' in the average Russian's psyche or
soul]{.underline}. Second of all, authoritarian thinking casts the
Russian people as foolish, childish, and naïve. This view suggests that
Russians are in constant need of 'protection' from the threat of foreign
influence by tough, manly leaders (and with all due respect to Catherine
the Great they are almost always manly), who don't go in for
questionable, effeminate pursuits like reforms and free speech, but who
know when to bang their fists (or shoes) on the table like the
proverbial family patriarchs, and bring the whole country to attention.
Over 80% of Russians believe that the Western media is motivated by a
desire to destroy Russia. Today, the very concept of foreign russophobia
is used by the state propaganda machine to muddy the waters as far as
the Ukraine crisis is concerned -- 'They're calling our Crimea
referendum an illegal sham? Of course they would do that! They hate us!'
'They're claiming we supplied the rebels with a missile that was used to
down Flight MH17? Psshhh! They've been calling us barbarians for
centuries, nothing changes!' According to state pollster WCIOM, over 80%
of Russians believe that the Western media is motivated by a desire to
destroy Russia itself whenever it criticises the Russian president. This
fact is telling, when it comes to understanding how Putin and Russia are
conflated in perceptions of russophobia. Russophobia or Kremlinphobia?
The Kremlinphobia emerging from the Ukraine crisis, when even the most
objective Western analysts decided that the Kremlin was acting in bad
faith, has neatly merged with russophobia in the minds of Russian
officials. Many of these officials aren't necessarily merging these
concepts consciously. The Russian state has always done everything it
could to conflate love of country with love of government, arguing that
one is indistinguishable from the other. This is why Russians who love
their homeland but question their government are once again being cast
as 'enemies,' 'traitors,' and 'fifth columnists.' They are hounded and
threatened in both public and private. This is why independent media in
Russia is not just in a precarious position anymore but has been almost
declared anathema. The simple calculation made says that Russia equals
the Kremlin. As it permeates most aspects of public life, the state is
declared to be the face and soul of the Russian nation. This equation is
not without its logic. After all, Russia is the biggest country in the
world. It contains many diverse populations who aren't always that fond
of one another. The country suffers from serious social inequality,
corruption, and infrastructure problems, as well as a violent insurgency
in the North Caucasus. All of these factors present a long-term threat
to Russian stability and territorial integrity. And because the
Kremlin's strategic thinking is more short-term than long-term, casting
the government as the soul of the nation has become a kind of band-aid
solution to this multitude of problems. Sure, things may be hard, the
message goes, but the government is the glue that's holding everything
together ---criticising us is like criticising the ground beneath your
feet. People fall for this argument because they don't feel they have a
choice. The problem of autocracy is that it is like a perpetually
collapsing house of cards. It leaves the people living under it few
alternatives apart from propping it up, or being buried underneath it.
Stereotyping Casting the government as the soul of the nation has become
a kind of band-aid solution. In actual fact, the Russian state is a
hybrid regime. It combines elements of autocracy with elements of
democracy, and its future isn't nearly as clear-cut as domestic
propagandists or foreign hawks would like everyone to believe. [**As the
unexpected twists and turns in the Ukraine crisis have demonstrated,
it's impossible to make confident predictions. And as this crisis wears
on, with thousands of lives lost in a cruel and senseless conflict in
eastern Ukraine, the domestic and foreign stereotyping of Russians has,
unsurprisingly, intensified, undoing years of progress towards greater
acceptance and understanding in the process.** I personally have lost
the will to argue with every self-righteous xenophobe who shows up ---
online or otherwise --- to tell me that Russians are 'inherently' evil.
I no longer have the will to explain to people that, by doing so, they
only aid the Kremlin in its worst impulses. There seems to be little use
in arguing for civility on either side anymore. The pain and damage of
the last few months has been too severe.]{.underline}

#### The 1ac's rearticulation of realism demarcates time and space through presenting a sovereign, stable representation of International Relations theory. This theoretical approach superimposes racial difference and delimits who can be a proper subject of History within IR's epistemic scope -- this erases non-European existence and legitimates colonialism, which turns and outweighs the aff.

Fanon and Hartman about temporality and violence," in *Time,
Temporality, and Violence in International Relations: (De)fatalizing the
Present, Forging Radical Alternatives*, Routledge, 2016 //tjb\]

**[Many realists present sovereignty as a formal, stable representation
of an idealized vision of political order, a solution to war or brute
violence; though embodied, these historical relations are rife with
tensions]{.underline}** (Krasner 2001; Morgenthau 1951; Waltz 1979).
**[They contain an implicit or explicit axiological hierarchy,
extrapolate an account of desirable political arrangements, and posit a
stable and unified conception of the state and institutional
arrangements and subjectivity primed to bring about that
order.]{.underline}** **[When sovereignty and war are used to produce
certain behaviors, perspectives, or political outcomes, they work
together as a particular kind of disciplinary construct that evades
time, even though time binds them.]{.underline}** The uncritical
acceptance of this displacement of time from our conceptualization of
the sovereign and war generates problems for our narration of history,
the sover- eign, war, violence, and political subjects. **[We must ask
whether such limited and politically circumscribed accounts become the
drivers of petrified relations and the mark of death, even when espoused
otherwise.]{.underline}** Engaging with theorists who problematize the
narrowly punctuated understand- ings of sovereignty, war, capital, and
subjectivity (Hartman 2007; Marriott 2014; Mbembe 1992; Wilderson 2010)
ought to yield insights. Even more important are Saidiya Hartman's
narration of the entanglements of time and slavery and Fanon's account
of violence, sovereignty, and capital. **[By superimposing time onto
various other given states and racialized situations to show their
'difference,' both grap- ple with time in relation to slavery,
colonization, and capitalism]{.underline}**. They open up questions
about sovereignty by creating theoretical concepts that traverse the
gaps among theorists of sovereignty, history, war, violence, and
capital. **[When we think in terms of time and temporality, the
parameters of the con- ceptualization of violence and fatalization of
the present change dramatically, allowing us to consider the
complexities of lived human experience and high- light dimensions of
social life that IR and certain critical postcolonial theorists have
seen as irrelevant.]{.underline}** In this chapter, in conversation with
Fanon and Hartman, we point to the ruptures/tensions accompanying
material technologies/the inven- tions, the 'real leap's in Fanon's
words (Fanon 1952: 229). Fanon's real leaps are radically untimely
(Marriott 2014: 518). They cannot be speculated or preempted. They are a
creative invention of a grammar that grapples with the 'form of antino-
mies of redemption (a salvational principle that will help us overcome
the injury of slavery and the long history of defeat) and
irreparability' (Hartman 2002: 759). Thinking of the force of time and
the event via Hartman on slavery and colo- nization stretches our narrow
understandings of sovereign power and forces of capture, allowing us to
consider imaginaries, as well as the ways institutions such as the state
and market consider some subjects mere esh outside the dialectical
movement of history or capital. **[Although we cannot fully represent or
narrate them, forces of time and the event produce problems. To a
greater or lesser extent, we can mark their interjec- tions and
irruptions into life otherwise experienced as continuity: we can per-
ceive their qualities, analyze indices of their interjection, and even
make them somewhat predictable. We are affected by them; we intensify
their force; we even precipitate their transformation.]{.underline}**
This chapter takes seriously Fanon's idea that 'the problem to be
considered here is one of time' (Fanon 1952: 226--227). In conversation
with Fanon and Hartman, we show the ways time and temporality in ect our
imagination and engagement with time and vulnerability in international
relations and world politics. One theo- rist takes the idea of time as a
problem of time (Fanon 1952) and as a force, 'arbi- trary and violent,
that positions \[the racialized subject\] globally' (Murillo 2013). The
other ruptures a linear understanding of the sovereign and the ways we
narrate violence to exclude slavery and colonization in its gendered
forms: her notion of an 'original generative act,' with the 'centrality'
of its 'blood-stained gate,' posits the ontological destruction of the
black woman as the 'inaugurating moment in the for- mation of the
enslaved' within modernity's violent arena of value (Hartman 2007: 18).
Both authors take seriously the way **[the concept of time becomes a
producer of a globality whose 'ontological horizon is manufactured by
scientific signifiers' (the sovereign as analogy or anarchy as metaphor)
and 'the political-symbolic weapons']{.underline}** (da Silva 1997: 5)
**[that produce non-Europeans as non-existent 'untimely'
subjects.]{.underline}** **[Those 'who thrive in the mark of
death']{.underline}** (ibid: 5) **[are not covered by the ethical prin-
ciples governing post-Enlightenment social
configurations.]{.underline}**

#### Every narrative and theory on the geopolitics of the East are tainted by xenophobic scholarship and projects like the aff are always just assimilated into the matrix of Russophobia.

**Mettan 17** (Guy Mettan, Swiss journalist and politician and President
of the Geneva Red Cross, "Creating Russophobia: From the Great Religious
Schism to Anti-Putin Hysteria")//KitKat

To convince, manipulating words is not enough. **[Constant repetition of
the same sentences on Russian expansionism and despotism eventually
becomes boring.]{.underline}** [Construction of the discourse is thus a
necessary stage, but it is not sufficient. To be effective and
widespread, a narrative must also be elaborated, a story narrated that
makes sense. An easy myth must be fabricated that will lodge in the
collective imagination]{.underline}. Construction of a Russophobic
narrative is thus infinitely complex. [More than a narrative, it is a
metanarrative, as language analysts call it, that is, a narrative within
a narrative, a history within history, which interlocks and gets tangled
like Russian nesting dolls. One fact leads to another, one event to a
series of events, one opinion to other opinions in other times, other
cultures, on other continents. But always those stories are linked to
the West, to Europe and the United States]{.underline}. This
agglomeration of tales ends up forming a hyper- fiction and generating a
new mythology, that of [the fierce Russian bear always ready to charge
out of its forests to devour the Little Red Riding Hood of the
West.]{.underline} As in every good myth, there must be an ogre, a
villain ready to demolish the innocent, which hopefully will come to a
bad end. [Fabricating a villain---Vladimir Putin in this case---is thus
essential to the smooth functioning of the myth]{.underline}. This myth
has a function, anthropologists say. It is to "substitute the truth to
better calm apprehensions and provide explanations that bring back
tranquility."1 Literally, a metanarrative is "a narrative on reality
whose function is to justify the past and the present." It is a
hyper-discourse which "deploys legitimizing functions in politics,
functions destined to edify collective values by way of the identity
unit." It is a unifying discourse able to inscribe innovations in a
teleological perspective and to point to criteria for life in common. In
a way, the construction of a 'monumental' history that ceaselessly turns
the present and the future into the past in order to maintain the
(actually dead) political identity. Therefore, the metanarrative places
us at the heart of myths and rituals in which and through which politics
becomes creed, ceremony and symbolic spread to the detriment of
citizens' accountability.2 Indeed, by including various myths, the
metanarrative tries to transform the current situation. But to do that,
the metanarrative must also transform the past. [This explains why the
dominant Russophobic discourse is so eager to rewrite history. The main
mission of memory occultation is to wipe out any traces of the positive
historical role of Russia in Europe and thus clear the deck for the
postmodern mythology of a united Atlanticist Europe centered around a
Warsaw, Berlin-Brussels-Paris-London-Washington axis.]{.underline} As
was done with Byzantium in the days of Charlemagne and the first Roman
Germanic emperors backed by the pope's theologians, it is a matter of
wiping Russia as European out of the European consciousness. Europe's
unity and future demand it, at least so say the modern theologians
building the myth of Euro-Atlantic union by opposing to it the myth of
the threatening Russian bear. **[Seen from that perspective, the
systematic interpretation of Russian actions in terms of threats to the
West is better understood. In that construction, every detail, every
micro-event must be carefully fit into the huge anti-Russian
interpretative grid. Putin's briefest statement, the briefest separatist
shellfire, the Greek prime minister's meeting with a Russian ambassador,
a pro-Western opponent's most insignificant tweet---all of this must be
analyzed, taken apart, reformatted and eventually amplified to enhance
the huge and moving picture of the horrors that Russia prepares with a
view to compromising the glorious edification of a Euro-Atlantic union
determined to build "peace, democracy and its peoples' prosperity" for
ever and ever]{.underline}**. Plugging Loopholes in the Narrative This
permits us to better understand the West's obsession to erase what it
has done to upset the Russian bear, such as thrusting the "borders" of
NATO in its very snout. It would not do if an overlooked small
contradiction, a tiny grain of sand, or an improbability made the engine
seize up. [If NATO were to be viewed as aggressive, rather than Russia,
the entire construction of the myth would collapse. If Russia, for the
umpteenth time, did not "invade" Ukraine, how to justify support for
Poroshenko when he is bombing Donetsk and massacring civilians in his
own country, as in the worst moments of the Sarajevo siege in 1992 and
1994? This is why the media and research institutes linked to European
construction or engaged in the defense of American supremacy always
drink at the same sources, always interview the same persons, always
quote the same experts, tirelessly repeat the same refrain: Putin is a
villain, Russia wants to invade us.]{.underline} And this is why, since
Charlemagne undertook to build a Latin-Germanic Empire in Europe,
Putin's predecessors, Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Nicolas I or
Stalin, were consistently portrayed with the vilest features, as
maleficent czars bent on crimes and oppression. What is good for the
genealogy of good kings is good for that of the bad guys: they must show
that the former derive directly from God and the latter from the devil.
Filiation is important. Like in The Lord of the Rings, the Dark Lord
Sauron could not be descended from soft and pacific elves, and neither
could a kind hobbit give birth to a killer whale. If the genealogy were
reversed, the entire mythology would collapse. Let us see now how the
metanarrative and the myths it carries are articulated. The first myth
is that of the evil czar. We have seen that the West had already gifted
Russia with a long line of "cruel, despotic czars" obsessed by the
restoration of Russian grandeur and imperialist expansion: Ivan IV the
Terrible, Nicolas I, Stalin, and today Vladimir Putin fulfil this
function. Almost all books and articles about them in the West take it
upon themselves to recall the horrors those leaders allegedly committed
against humanity and civilization.

#### Vote neg to make the aff go back to the drawing board -- they need to scrutinize the Russophobia of their IR theory before the reading of the affirmative even takes place.

Russophobia", https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209716)//KitKat

[Ever since the Cold War ended, Western officials and commentators have
been telling the Russians how they need to grow out of their Cold War
attitudes toward the West and Western institutions, and learn to see
things in a \"modern\" and \"normal\" way. **And there is a good deal of
truth in this. At the same time, it would have been good if we had
subjected our own inherited atti- tudes toward Russia to a more rigorous
scrutiny**]{.underline}. [For like any other inherited ha- tred, blind,
dogmatic hostility toward Rus- sia leads to bad policies, bad
journalism, and the corruption of honest debate - and there is all too
much of this hatred in West- ern portrayals of and comments on
Russia]{.underline}. From this point of view, an analysis of Russophobia
has implications that go far be- yond Russia. Much of the U.S. foreign
pol- icy debate, especially on the Republican side, is structured around
the belief that American policy should be rooted in a ro- bust defense
of national interest - and this is probably also the belief of most
ordinary Americans. However, this straightforward view coexists with
another, equally wide- spread, view that dominates the media. [It is, in
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\'s words, that \"the United States
stands taller than other nations, and therefore sees fur- ther.\" The
unspoken assumption here is that America is not only wise but also
objective, at least in its perceptions: that U.S. policy is influenced
by values, but never by national prejudices. The assumption behind much
American (and Western) reporting of for- eign conflicts is that the
writer is morally engaged but ethnically uncommitted and able to turn a
benign, all-seeing eye from above on the squabbles of
humanity]{.underline}. It is impossible to exaggerate how irri- tating
this attitude is elsewhere in the world, or how misleading and dangerous
it is for Western audiences who believe it. Not only does it contribute
to mistaken poli- cies, but it renders both policymakers and ordinary
citizens incapable of understanding the opposition of other nations to
those poli- cies. Concerning the Middle East, it seems likely that most
Americans genuinely be- lieve that the United States is a neutral and
objective broker in relations between Israelis and Palestinians - which
can only appear to an Arab as an almost fantastically bad joke. This
belief makes it much more difficult for Americans to comprehend the
reasons for Palestinian and Arab fury at both the United States and
Israel. **[It encourages a Western interpretation of this anger as the
manipulation of sheep-like masses by elites. At worst, it can encourage
a kind of racism, in which certain nations are classed as irrationally,
irredeemably savage and wicked]{.underline}**. Concerning Russia, the
main thrust of the official Western rhetoric with respect to the
enlargement of NATO, and Russia\'s response, has been that the alliance
is no longer a Cold War organization or a threat to Russia, that NATO
enlargement has noth- ing to do with Russia, that Russia should welcome
enlargement, and that Russian op- position is not merely groundless but
fool- ish and irrational. It is of course true that Russian fears of
NATO expansion have been exaggerated, and some of the rhetoric has been
wild. Still, given the attitudes toward Russia reflected in much of the
Western me- dia (especially among the many supporters of NATO
enlargement), a Russian would have to a a moron or a traitor to approve
the ex- pansion of NATO without demanding guaran- tees of Russian
interests and security.1 This is not to deny that there has been a great
deal to condemn in many aspects of Russian behavior over the past
decade, the war in Chechnya being the most ghastly example. [But
justifiable Western criticism has all too often been marred by attacks
that have been hysterical and one-sided, and it has taken too little
account of the genuine problems and threats with which Russians have had
to struggle]{.underline}. This has been espe- cially true of comment on
the latest Chechen war, which began in the summer of 1999.

### ALT -- Undercommons

#### The alternative is to steal the affirmative -- steal it away to the undercommons of enlightenment, into an alternative theory of being together that transcends the ethos of self-possession instituted by the affirmatives theory of international relations. If the only option for Taiwanese people is to be in the place that is no-place, the undercommons is that place, the no-place and no-time of the subversive intellectual.

**["To the university I'll steal, and there I'll steal,"]{.underline}**
to borrow from Pistol at the end of Henry V, as he would surely borrow
from us. **[This is the only possible relationship to the American
university today]{.underline}**. This may be true of universities
everywhere. It may have to be true of the university in general. But
certainly, this much is true in the United States: [it cannot be denied
that the university is a place of refuge, and it cannot be accepted that
the university is a place of enlightenment]{.underline}. **[In the face
of these conditions one can only sneak into the university and steal
what one can. To abuse its hospitality, to spite its mission, to join
its refugee colony, its gypsy encampment, to be in but not of -- this is
the path of the subversive intellectual in the modern
university.]{.underline}** [Worry about the university. This is the
injunction today in the United States, one with a long
history.]{.underline} Call for its restoration like Harold Bloom or
Stanley Fish or Gerald Graf. Call for its reform like Derek Bok or Bill
Readings or Cary Nelson. [Call out to it as it calls to
you.]{.underline} But [for the subversive intellectual, all of this goes
on upstairs, in polite company, among the rational men.]{.underline}
[After all, **the subversive intellectual came under false pretenses**,
with bad documents, out of love]{.underline}. **[Her labor is as
necessary as it is unwelcome. The university needs what she bears but
cannot bear what she brings]{.underline}**. And on top of all that, she
disappears. [She disappears into the underground, the downlow lowdown
maroon community of the university, **into the undercommons of
enlightenment, where the work gets done, where the work gets subverted,
where the revolution is still black, still strong.**]{.underline} What
is that work and what is its social capacity for both reproducing the
university and producing fugitivity? If one were to say teaching, one
would be performing the work of the university. **[Teaching is merely a
profession and an operation of that onto-/auto-encyclopedic circle of
the state" that Jacques Derrida calls the Universitas. But it is useful
to invoke this operation to glimpse the hole in the fence where labor
enters, to glimpse its hiring hall, its night quarters]{.underline}**.
**[The university needs teaching labor,]{.underline}** despite itself,
or as itself, self-identical with and thereby erased by it. **[It is not
teaching that holds this social capacity, but something that produces
the not visible other side of teaching, a thinking through the skin of
teaching toward a collective orientation to the knowledge object as
future project, and a commitment to what we want to call the prophetic
organization. But it is teaching that brings us in]{.underline}**.
Before there are grants, research, conferences, books, and journals
there is the experience of being taught and of teaching. Before the
research post with no teaching, before the graduate students to mark the
exams, before the string of sabbaticals, before the permanent reduction
in teaching load, the appointment to run the Center, the consignment of
pedagogy to a discipline called education, before the course designed to
be a new book, teaching happened. [T**he moment of teaching for food is
therefore often mistakenly taken to be a stage, as if eventually one
should not teach for food. If the stage persists, there is a social
pathology in the university. But if the teaching is successfully passed
on, the stage is surpassed, and teaching is consigned to those who are
known to remain in the stage, the sociopathological labor of the
university**. Kant interestingly calls such a stage "self-incurred
minority."]{.underline} He tries to contrast it with having the
"determination and courage to use one's intelligence without being
guided by another." "Have the courage to use your own intelligence."
[But what would it mean if teaching or rather what we might call "the
beyond of teaching" is precisely what one is asked to get beyond, to
stop taking sustenance? **And what of those minorities who refuse, the
tribe of moles who will not come back from beyond (that which is beyond
"the beyond of teaching"), as if they will not be subjects, as if they
want to think as objects, as minority? Certainly, the perfect subjects
of communication, those successfully beyond teaching, will see them as
waste.** But their collective labor will always call into question who
truly is taking the orders of the enlightenment.]{.underline} The waste
lives for those moments beyond teaching when you give away the
unexpected beautiful phrase -- unexpected, no one has asked, beautiful,
it will never come back. Is being the biopower of the enlightenment
truly better than this? Perhaps the biopower of the enlightenment knows
this, or perhaps it is just reacting to the objecthood of this labor as
it must. [**But even as it depends on these moles, these refugees, it
will call them uncollegial, impractical, naive, unprofessional.** And
one may be given one last chance to be pragmatic -- why steal when one
can have it all, they will ask]{.underline}. **[But if one hides from
this interpellation, neither agrees nor disagrees but goes with hands
full into the underground of the university, into the Undercommons --
this will be regarded as theft, as a criminal act.]{.underline}** **[And
it is at the same time, the only possible act]{.underline}**. In that
undercommons of the university one can see that it is not a matter of
teaching versus research or even the beyond of teaching versus the
individualisation of research. **[To enter this space is to inhabit the
ruptural and enraptured disclosure of the commons that fugitive
enlightenment enacts, the criminal, matricidal, queer, in the cistern,
on the stroll of the stolen life, the life stolen by enlightenment and
stolen back, where the commons give refuge, where the refuge gives
commons. What the beyond of teaching is really about is not fnishing
oneself, not passing, not completing;]{.underline}** [it's about
allowing subjectivity to be unlawfully overcome by others, a radical
passion and passivity such that one becomes unft for subjection, because
one does not possess the kind of agency that can hold the regulatory
forces of subjecthood, and one cannot initiate the auto-interpellative
torque that biopower subjection requires and rewards.]{.underline} **[It
is not so much the teaching as it is the prophecy in the organization of
the act of teaching]{.underline}**. [The prophecy that predicts its own
organization and has therefore passed, as commons, and the prophecy that
exceeds its own organization and therefore as yet can only be
organized.]{.underline} Against the prophetic organization of the
undercommons is arrayed its own deadening labor for the university, and
beyond that, the negligence of professionalization, and the
professionalization of the critical academic. [The undercommons is
therefore always an unsafe neighborhood]{.underline}. As Fredric Jameson
reminds us, the university depends upon **["Enlightenment-type critiques
and demystifcation ofs belief and committed ideology, in order to clear
the ground for unobstructed planning and 'development.'" Tis is the
weakness of the university, the lapse in its homeland security. It needs
labor power for this "enlightenmenttype critique," but, somehow, labor
always escapes.]{.underline}** Te premature subjects of the undercommons
took the call seriously, or had to be serious about the call. Tey were
not clear about planning, too mystical, too full of belief. And yet this
labor force cannot reproduce itself, it must be reproduced. **[Te
university works for the day when it will be able to rid itself, like
capital in general, of the trouble of labor]{.underline}**. [It will
then be able to reproduce a labor force that understands itself as not
only unnecessary but dangerous to the development of
capitalism.]{.underline} **[Much pedagogy and scholarship is already
dedicated in this direction. Students must come to see themselves as the
problem, which, counter to the complaints of restorationist critics of
the university, is precisely what it means to be a customer, to take on
the burden of realisation and always necessarily be inadequate to
it.]{.underline}** **[Later, these students will be able to see
themselves properly as obstacles to society, or perhaps, with lifelong
learning, students will return having successfully diagnosed themselves
as the problem.]{.underline}** Still, the dream of an undiferentiated
labor that knows itself as superfuous is interrupted precisely by the
labor of clearing away the burning roadblocks of ideology. While it is
better that this police function be in the hands of the few, it still
raises labor as diference, labor as the development of other labor, and
therefore labor as a source of wealth. [And although the
enlightenment-type critique, as we suggest below, informs on, kisses the
cheek of, any autonomous development as a result of this diference in
labor, there is a break in the wall here, a shallow place in the river,
a place to land under the rocks. **Te university still needs this
clandestine labor to prepare this undiferentiated labor force, whose
increasing specialisation and managerialist tendencies, again contra the
restorationists, represent precisely the successful integration of the
division of labor with the universe of exchange that commands
restorationist loyalty.**]{.underline} **[Introducing this labor upon
labor, and providing the space for its development, creates
risks]{.underline}**. [Like the colonial police force recruited
unwittingly from guerrilla neighborhoods, university labor may harbor
refugees, fugitives, renegades, and castaways]{.underline}. But there
are good reasons for the university to be confdent that such elements
will be exposed or forced underground. Precautions have been taken, book
lists have been drawn up, teaching observations conducted, invitations
to contribute made. **[Yet against these precautions stands the
immanence of transcendence, the necessary deregulation and the
possibilities of criminality and fugitivity that labor upon labor
requires. Maroon communities of composition teachers, mentorless
graduate students, adjunct Marxist historians, out or queer management
professors, state college ethnic studies departments, closed-down flm
programs, visaexpired Yemeni student newspaper editors, historically
black college sociologists, and feminist engineers. And what will the
university say of them? It will say they are unprofessional. Tis is not
an arbitrary charge. It is the charge against the more than
professional. How do those who exceed the profession, who exceed and by
exceeding escape, how do those maroons problematize themselves,
problematize the university, force the university to consider them a
problem, a danger? Te undercommons is not, in short, the kind of
fanciful communities of whimsy invoked by Bill Readings at the end of
his book. The undercommons, its maroons, are always at war, always in
hiding.]{.underline}**

### TURN -- Realism

#### Structural realism is ineffective to explain IR

**Goldstein, 03** (Avery Goldstein, professor of Global Politics and
International Relations @ upenn, "Structural Realism and China's Foreign
Policy: Much (But Never All) of the Story,"
<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781403981707_7>, date
accessed: July 29, 2019) // radronning

Can structural realism provide a satisfactory explanation for China's
foreign policy? China scholars have often criticized the work of social
scientists, especially those relying on abstract theories, for ignoring
the special features of the Chinese case.1 Since **[structural realism
intentionally sets aside the distinctiveness of particular
cases]{.underline}**, it would certainly seem to be an obvious target
for this sort of argument. Such criticism, however, is both accurate and
beside the point. The issue is not whether **[structural
realism]{.underline}** can or **[cannot provide an adequate explanation
for China's foreign policy]{.underline}**. It cannot, **[as even
neorealism's founding theorist would readily concede]{.underline}**.
Rather, the important question is how much of the explanation can the
international-structural causes it highlights provide? With this
question in mind, the following chapter reconsiders China's foreign
policy during and after the Cold War. In Man, the State, and War and
Theory of International Politics, Kenneth Waltz explained recurrent
patterns of international behavior and outcomes by highlighting the
causal significance of the system's structure---the constraints of
anarchy emphasized in the former work, and constraints of polarity
emphasized in the latter. Yet, he also indicated that **[however
powerful these structural constraints may be, the explanation of a
particular international outcome (e.g., the outbreak of a specific war)
and the explanation a particular state's behavior]{.underline}**
**[(e.g., its foreign policy) will be incomplete and often misleading if
the analyst ignores causes intentionally set aside for the purposes of
crafting a parsimonious systems theory.]{.underline}**2 [That including
a host of such causes---the personality of state leaders, parochial
political interests of government bureaucrats, ideology, and domestic
social, economic, and political structures---helps provide a fuller
account of the foreign policy choices particular states make, is not
proof of neorealism's fatal flaw, but rather another demonstration of
some simple methodological points.]{.underline} A theory is an attempt
to depict an aspect of the real world through abstraction and
simplification; in making sense of its chosen domain of inquiry, every
theory has a limited range of application; a theory with a wider range
of application is more useful or powerful, but even a powerful theory
provides only a partial account of reality.3 The example frequently
cited to make the last point, makes it well. Newtonian mechanics is a
powerful body of theory (whose limits modern physicists eventually
exposed). Nevertheless, although its attraction provide a compelling
explanation as to why leaves fall to the ground rather than ascend to
the heavens, they are of little use in understanding the different paths
followed by leaves as opposed to apples.4 To explain such differences,
of course, requires drawing on other theories that focus on aspects of
the physical world that were set aside by Newton. The usefulness of
aerodynamics for explaining the path of falling bodies complements
rather than contradicts Newton's insights about gravitational
attraction. Engineers, engaged in applied as opposed to theoretical
science, draw on and combine the insights that abstract and simplified
disciplinary research provides. One should expect it to be likewise with
the study of China's foreign policy. In analyzing a specific empirical
case, one is engaged in applied science, not theoretical science. Thus,
to restate the point made earlier, the question is not whether
neorealism can explain China's foreign policy, but rather how much of
the explanation can the international-structural causes it highlights
provide?

#### Realism is incapable of understanding the depth and intricacies in global environmental and war impacts.

**Ahemed 10**,xx-xx-2010, "The international relations of crisis and the
crisis of international relations: from the securitisation of scarcity
to the militarisation of society", Routlege//aadi

In one salient example, [O'Keefe draws extensively on both offensive and
defensive variants of neorealist theory, including the work of Jack
Snyder, Robert Jervis and Kenneth Waltz, to argue for realism's
continuing relevance in understanding how the 'biophysical environment
plays a significant role in triggering and prolonging the structural
conditions that result in conflict']{.underline}. She notes that
[standard realist concepts such as 'anarchy, security dilemmas, and the
prisoner's dilemma' can be used to explain the emergence of
environmental or resource-based violent conflicts largely within, and
occasionally between, the weaker states of the South]{.underline}.
'Environmental anarchy' occurs in weak states which lack 'active
government regulation' of the [internal distribution of natural
resources, leading to a 'tragedy of the commons'. This generates
resource scarcities which lead to 'security dilemmas' over ownership of
resources, often settled by resort to violence, perpetuated by 'the
prisoner's dilemma']{.underline}. 56 Ultimately, this [theoretical
hypothesis on the causes of environmental or resource-related conflict
is incapable of engaging with the deeper intersecting global structural
conditions generating resource scarcities, independently of insufficient
government management of the internal distribution of resources in weak
states]{.underline}. It simplistically applies the Hobbesian assumption
that without a centralised 'Leviathan' state structure, the persistence
of anarchy in itself generates conflict over resources. [Under the guise
of restoring the significance of the biophysical environment to orthodox
IR, this approach in effect actually occludes the environment as a
meaningful causal factor, reducing it to a mere epiphenomenon of the
dynamics of anarchy in the context of state failure. As a consequence,
this approach is theoretically impotent in grasping the systemic
acceleration of global ecological, energy and economic crises as a
direct consequence of the way in which the inter-state system itself
exploits the biophysical environment.]{.underline} The same criticism in
fact applies to opposing theories that resource abundance is a major
cause of violent conflict. Bannon and Collier, for instance, argue that
resource abundance and greed, rather than resource scarcity and
political grievances, generated intra-state conflicts financed by the
export of commodities in regions like Angola and Sierra Leone (diamonds)
or West Africa (tropical timber). In other regions, abundance rather
than shortages of oil, drugs and gold fuelled and financed violent
secessionist movements in the context of widespread corruption and poor
governance.57 Ultimately, this departs little from the theoretical
assumptions bove, with weak central state governance still blamed for
generating anarchic conditions conducive to conflict over abundant
resources. Furthermore, as Kaldor shows, this s[implistic perspective
overlooks the wider context of the global political economy -- the
evolution of regional 'war economies' was often enabled precisely by the
devastating impact of neoliberal structural adjustment programmes, which
eroded state structures and generated social crises that radicalised
identity politics.58 Under traditional neorealist logic, a strategic
response to global environmental crises must involve the expansion of
state-military capabilities in order to strengthen the centralised
governance structures whose task is to regulate the international
distribution of natural resources, as well as to ensure that a
particular state's own resource requirements are protected. Neorealism
understands inter-state competition, rivalry and warfare as inevitable
functions of states' uncertainty about their own survival, arising from
the anarchic structure of the international system.]{.underline} Gains
for one state are losses for another, and each state's attempt to
maximise its power relative to all other states is simply a reflection
of its rational pursuit of its own security. [The upshot is the
normalisation of political violence in the international system,
including practices such as over-exploitation of energy and the
environment, as a 'rational' strategy -- even though this ultimately
amplifies global systemic insecurity. Inability to cooperate
internationally and for mutual benefit is viewed as an inevitable
outcome of the simple, axiomatic existence of multiple states. The
problem is that neorealism cannot explain in the first place the complex
interdependence and escalation of global crises. Unable to situate these
crises in the context of an international system that is not simply a
set of states, but a transnational global structure based on a specific
exploitative relationship with the biophysical environment, neorealism
can only theorise global crises as 'new issue areas' appended to already
existing security agendas.59 Yet by the very act of projecting global
crises as security threats, neorealism renders itself powerless to
prevent or mitigate them by theorising their root structural causes. In
effect, despite its emphasis on the reasons why states seek security,
neorealism's approach to issues like climate change actually guarantees
greater insecurity by promoting policies which frame these
'non-traditional' issues purely as amplifiers of quite traditional
threats]{.underline}. As Susanne Peters argues, the neorealist approach
renders the militarisation of foreign and domestic policy a pragmatic
and necessary response to issues such as resource scarcities -- yet, in
doing so, it entails the inevitable escalation of 'resource wars' in the
name of energy security. Practically, this serves not to increase
security for competing state and non-state actors, but to debilitate
international security through the proliferation of violent conflict to
access and control diminishing resources in the context of unpredictable
complex emergencies.60 Neorealism thus negates its own theoretical
utility and normative value. For if 'security' is the fundamental driver
of state foreign policies, then why are states chronically incapable of
effectively ameliorating the global systemic amplifiers of 'insecurity',
despite the obvious rationale to do so in the name of warding off
collective destruction, if not planetary annihilation?61

ANTI-INTELLECT 11

[antiintellect](http://antiintellect.wordpress.com/), Graduate of
Florida F&M, "CELEBRATING BLACK GAY VERNACULAR" December 22,
2011\<http://antiintellect.wordpress.com/2011/12/22/celebrating-black-gay-vernacular/\>

So, in the fall of 2006 I entered college as a freshmen student at
Florida A&M University. It would be in this environment that I would
come to fully integrate myself into **[Black Gay
Vernacular]{.underline}**. In college, I came into contact with a host
of words and expressions that I had never heard of. **[The Black
gays]{.underline}** in this college town **[had a language all their
own, one separate from the language used by the heterosexual environment
of my youth.]{.underline}** In the settings I found myself in college,
**["shade" "the tea," "miss girl," "yes ma'am," "stud," "femme," "paid
it,", "kiki," "read," "Alice," "sick'ning," "trade," and "late" were the
words commonly and affectionately used. Learning this language was like
learning any other language]{.underline}**, it took work and familiarity
with those who spoke it. I would become familiar with this language by
my continued embracing of the Black gay culture of Tallahassee. I'd like
to share some examples of Black Gay Vernacular in action. If you're not
familiar with Black gay culture, you likely won't understand a word of
what I am saying, but for those who are familiar it will be like talking
to an old friend. "The real T is that mama couldn't get her coins up so
she boosted that store and trade called Alice." "That performance last
night was sick'ning. He cleared it, and the late kids couldn't take."
"The kids are going to gag when I tip through the bar." "Shade comes
from reading." -- Dorian Corey (Got to know my history) "That gave me my
life." "The kids cleared it, last night. They did not have it!" These
are but a few examples of Black Gay Vernacular, in action, and I could
honestly go on all day with colorful examples of the language. I could
explain what it all means, but I think an understanding of the language
should come with access to the group that uses the language. As the
saying goes, to know there you have to go there. The conditions that
make a Black gay vernacular necessary are the same as those that
underlie the development of all languages. There has been, and remains,
a need for Black gay people to communicate with each other, removed from
the gaze of heterosexual gaze. **[The vernacular employed by Black gays
does not need to be validated by outsiders because our participation in
it, and continued invention of it, is all the validation that is
needed.]{.underline}** Like all languages, there are certain issues that
pop up in Black Gay Vernacular. There are many within the Black Gay
Community who rightfully contest the usage of certain words and
expressions, I being one such person. I have called into question the
use of popular word "fish," and many others take issue with the use of
"girl." I do, however, feel that these words can be used among
familiars, such as a group of friends, but the issue comes into play
when people use the word with those they are not familiar with. In my
opinion, the future of Black Gay Vernacular is bright**[. New words,
phrases, and expressions are being created every day. Somewhere, a
creative young gay is crafting term to express themselves and their
friends, and this act represents the vitality of language. Toni Morrison
once wrote, "We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do
language. That may be the measure of our lives." The language of the
Black gay community remains one of the greatest measures of our lives, a
reminder of our creativity, our insistence on expressing ourselves in a
racist and homophobic society.]{.underline}**

#### WHITE LNAGUAGE PRACTICES HOLD BLACK BODIES TO AN EXTERNAL STANDARD OF WHITE PERFECTION. WE MUST MAKE ROOM FOR Peopel TO CREATE TRUTH.

**Yancy 2005** *Journal of Speculative Philosophy* 19.4 (2005) 215-241

**[In the face]{.underline}** of my white teacher\'s **[racism, I could
have decided to lose myself in laughter, but, like Frantz Fanon, I was
aware \"that there were legends, stories, histories, and above all
*historicity*\"]{.underline}** (1967, 112). My dark embodied existence,
my lived historical being, becomes a chain of signifiers: inferior,
Nigger, evil, dirty, sullen, immoral, lascivious. As Fanon writes,
**[\"In the unconscious, black = ugliness, sin, darkness,
immorality\"]{.underline}** (192). **[When
phenomenologically]{.underline}** \[End Page 221\] **[returned to
myself, I appear no longer to possess *my* body, but a \"surrogate\"
body whose meaning does not exist anterior to the performance of white
spectatorship]{.underline}. [Under the white gaze, \"the Black has no
ontological resistance in the eyes of the white man]{.underline}\"**
(110). Again, this involves the asymmetry of representational power.
**[The Black body appears to have no resistance vis-à-vis
the]{.underline}** somatic regulatory epistemic **[regime of
whiteness.]{.underline}** **[The Black body becomes]{.underline}**
ontologically pliable, **[just a thing to be scripted in the inverse
image of whiteness.]{.underline}** Cutting away at the Black body, the
Black person becomes resigned to no longer aspire to his/her own
emergence or upheaval (116). **[Blacks undergo processes of ontological
stagnation and epistemological violence while standing before the one
\"true\" gaze]{.underline}.** In very powerful discourse describing how
he was \"unmercifully imprisoned,\" how the white gaze forced upon him
an unfamiliar weight, Fanon asks, \"What else could it be for me but an
amputation, an excision, a hemorrhage that spattered my whole body with
black blood?\" (112).

The burden of the white gaze disrupts my first-person knowledge, causing
\"difficulties in the development of \[my\] bodily schema\" (110).
**[The white gaze constructs the Black body into \"an object in the
midst of other objects\"]{.underline}** (109). The nonthreatening \"I\"
of my normal, everyday body schema becomes the threatening \"him\" of
the Negro kind/type. Under pressure, the corporeal schema collapses. It
gives way to a racial epidermal
schema.^[6](http://ezproxy.bgc.bard.edu:2053/journals/journal_of_speculative_philosophy/v019/19.4yancy.html#FOOT6)\ \"Below\ the\ corporeal\ schema,\"\ writes\ Fanon,\ \"I\ had\ sketched\ a\ historico-racial\ schema.\ The\ elements\ that\ I\ used\ had\ been\ provided\ for\ me\ not\ by\ \'residual\ sensations\ and\ perceptions\ of\ a\ primarily\ tactile,\ vestibular,\ kinesthetic,\ and\ visual\ character,\'\ but\ by\ the\ other,\ the\ white\ man\ \[woman\]\"\ (111).\ In\ other\ words,\ Fanon\ began\ to\ \"see\"\ himself\ through\ the\ lens\ of\ a\ historico-racial\ schema.\ Note\ that\ there\ was\ nothing\ intrinsic\ to\ his\ physiology\ that\ forced\ his\ corporeal\ schema\ to\ collapse;\ it\ was\ the\ \"Black\ body\"\ as\ always\ already^
*named* and made sense of within the context of a larger semiotics of
privileged white bodies that provided him with the tools for
self-hatred. His \"darkness,\" a naturally occurring
phenomenon,^[7](http://ezproxy.bgc.bard.edu:2053/journals/journal_of_speculative_philosophy/v019/19.4yancy.html#FOOT7)\ became\ historicized,\ residing\ within\ the\ purview\ of\ the\ white\ gaze,\ a\ phenomenal\ space\ created\ and\ sustained\ by\ socioepistemic\ and\ semiotic\ communal\ constitutionality.\ On\ this\ score,\ the\ Black\ body\ is\ placed\ within\ the\ space\ of\ constitutionality\ vis-à-vis\ the\ racist\ white^
*same,* the *One*. Against the backdrop of the sketched historico-racial
(racist) scheme, Fanon\'s \"darkness\" returns to him, signifying a new
genus, a new category of man: A Negro! (116). He inhabits a space of
anonymity (he is *every* Negro), and yet he feels a strange personal
responsibility for his body. He writes:

**[I was responsible at the same time for my body, for my race, for my
ancestors. I subjected myself to an objective examination, I discovered
my blackness, my ethnic characteristics; and I was battered down by
tom-toms, cannibalism, intellectual deficiency, fetishism, racial
defects, slave-ships, and above all else, above all: \"sho\'
goodeaten\'.\"]{.underline}**

spirituals, and the blues---[**[provided the foundation for social and

**[[inheritance of hegemonic discourses does not

power, **[[enslaved blacks refused to become helpless victims
and]{.mark} [instead enacted their agency by cultivating discursive
weapons based on an identity as oppressed people.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The result was the creation of folktales about the "bottom becoming the
top teir" (i.e., the slave rising out of slavery )or spirituals that
called folks to "Gather at the river" (i.e., to plan an escape).

In the last ten years, **[a variety of cross-disciplinary scholars have

through our everyday
communication]{.underline}.**^[1](http://ezproxy.bgc.bard.edu:2053/journals/theatre_topics/v014/14.2warren.html#FOOT1)\ In\ some\ of\ these\ studies^[,
**whiteness is revealed as a strategic rhetoric**]{.underline}**, [a
means by which people, working in concert and often unreflectively, levy
power and cultural influence]{.underline}.** For example, communication
and film scholars examine rhetorical constructions of whiteness (see
Crenshaw; Dyer; Nakayama and Krizek; Shome). While **[this perspective
may help us understand the role of language (and how social systems and
individuals work in concert to create racial oppression]{.underline})
recent [efforts by scholars to maintain a focus on the white subject
have underscored the importance of deconstructing and challenging white
subjectivity in order to promote a more equitable and socially just
society]{.underline}**. Research here has taken many forms. Critical
scholars in theatre have led the way, **[creating critical performances
of whiteness]{.underline}** (see Jackson; O\'Brien; Warren and Kilgard)
that **[function to mirror, particularly to white audiences, the
mechanisms and machinations of their oppressive actions, however
unreflective]{.underline}. [Ethnographic portraits of whiteness have
given depth and immediacy to our understandings of people in lived
context]{.underline}** (Hartigan; hooks; Warren, *Performing*).
**[Autoethnographers, because they plumb their lived experience for
particular details and contradictions about how they create and are
created by culture, have constituted a rich repository for the study of
how each of us works to understand his or her own ethnic
identity]{.underline}** (Clark and O\'Donnell; Pelias; Warren,
\"Absence\"). [**Studies in education have also created a critical
context for understanding how whiteness permeates our
classrooms**]{.underline} (see Giroux; Hytten and Adkins; McIntyre);
**[such work functions to remind us of the power of pedagogy to help us
see and re-see the actions we take, challenge, or leave
unquestioned.]{.underline}**

In an earlier essay, one of us organized, from across the variety of
disciplinary perspectives, **[four key scholarly approaches to the study
of whiteness to help create a nuanced understanding of

and cultural thicket]{.underline}** (Warren, \"Whiteness\"). First,

**[[Linguistic imperialism also permeates all the other types]{.mark} of

express them]{.underline}**. Each is a theoretical construct forming
part of imperialism and a global theory which is concerned with the
structural relations between rich and poor countries and the mechanisms
by which the inequality between them is maintained . Each type overlaps
and interweaves with the others and must be seen as an over-arching
world structure. **[[Activities in each area contribute to the

The [**[introduction of literacy in English throughout the
Pacific]{.underline}** d]{.mark}uring the 19th century **[[has been a
major catalyst of change in indigenous cultures and ways of
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Literacy in English brought into the
Pacific information and knowledge of other ways of doing things. In the
words of linguist, the late Donald Topping from the University of
Hawai'i: \"It is **[[the growing use of]{.mark}]{.underline}** these
**[[western concepts and languages among]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[island peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[is leading
them]{.mark}]{.underline}** headlong **[[into]{.mark}]{.underline}**
rapid social **[[chang]{.mark}e]{.underline}** which
**[t[he]{.mark}]{.underline}** vulnerable
**[[cultures]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the Pacific **[[may not
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" He goes on to say that **[[Pacific
peoples will have to choose between literacy in]{.mark}]{.underline}**
the **[[metropolitan languages]{.mark} [and their cultures]{.mark}. [If
they opt for literacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** beyond minimal uses**[,
[they can say goodbye]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline}** their **[[old
belief systems and life]{.underline}]{.mark}**ways. It seems the result
has been a decline in Pacific languages not only in New Zealand but in
some of the Pacific islands themselves.Decolonising the Pacific means
putting an end to the linguistic imperialism of English. It means
bringing back the indigenous languages of the Pacific so that Pacific
peoples may become bilingual and biliterate, thereby contributing to the
enrichment of this country by its diversity of languages and cultures.
**[[The only ways to counter the loss of Pacific languages]{.mark}
in]{.underline}** New Zealand **[[is for Pacific people to use them, and
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[Government to provide the means that
would help Pacific New Zealanders to use and learn their
languages.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

sociocultural group, or its most perceptive members acting
representatively, turn, bend, or reflect back upon themselves, upon the

which make up their public selves.

Unlike Champagne's deployment of queer theory , the model of **[quare
studies]{.underline}** that propose would not only critique the concept
of "race" as historically contingent and socially and culturally
performed, it **[would]{.underline}** also **[address the material
effects of race in a white supremacist society. Quare]{.underline}**
studies **[requires an acknowledgment by the critic of her or his
position within an oppressive system. To fail to do so
would]{.underline}**, as Ruth Goldman argues, **["\[leave\] the burden
of dealing with difference on the people who are themselves different,
while simultaneously allowing white academics to construct a discourse
of silence around race and other queer perspectives.]{.underline}**"
Ones "**[experience" within that system]{.underline}**, however
discursively mediated, **[is]{.underline}** also**[materially
conditioned. A critic cannot ethically and responsibly speak from a

whiteness, which]{.underline}**, until very recently, **[has gone

Other racial groups, particularly **[[Blacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
Native Americans, **[[are considered]{.mark}]{.underline}** inherently
**[[criminal no matter what]{.mark} [they do]{.mark},]{.underline}**
what their sexual identity is **[[or]{.mark}]{.underline}** what they
**[[wear]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Further**[, it [has always struck me as
interesting that]{.mark}]{.underline}** there are **[[white
people]{.mark} who [will attempt to wear what will signify "Blackness,"
whether it is dreadlocks]{.mark} (]{.underline}**which, in my opinion,
should be cut off from every white person's head), **["[gear," or Black
masks]{.mark} at rallies. T[here is a sick way in which white people
want to emulate that which is considered "badass"

**[[Blackness at the same time they do not want]{.mark} [the burden of

violence?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Now I know that somewhere there is a

7.Permutations are illegitimate: The Affirmative use of a perm in this
debate is a product of Plan-focus debates which requires that the
negative prove that the aff is a bad idea. We will win that the plan
focus model of debate is bad and should be replaced by a "Comparison
Focus between performances"

Our interpretation: The Judge always has a forced choice between the two
teams and can only cast a ballot for one team. The ballot should be cast
for the team that produces the comparatively desirable benefits.

Reasons to prefer:

1\. "Plan focus" justifies conditionality- it allows the negative to
merely " test" the desirability of the aff and allow aff perm "test " as
well

2\. Conditionality is bad for debate- encourages argument
irresponsibility, late development of arguments and kitchen sink and see
what sticks strats. That's bad for education because it encourages the
sloppy use of multiple contradictory positions.

3\. The perm debate is like a presidential election where you have to
choose one performance or the other. During the presidential election
you didn't get to choose the best combination of Obama and McCain, on
election day you had to cast your ballot for one or the other not a
mutation of both.

4\. Plan focus unlimits debate- several; topical and non topical options
The neg would have to prepare for- our interp allows neg to research and
strat and defend.[N]{.underline}othing checks the number of conditional
arguments the negative can run. The negative can run 7 conditional
counter plans and the 2nc can add more. The affirmative can also run
intrinsic arguments in every time the negative teams run a new argument.
At the core of comparison focus is a symmetrical and equivalent advocacy
burden. 5. Underlimiting is bad for debate, it kills ground.

6\. Plan focus debate force black people to defend whiteness. That
forces the negative to prove the affirmative is a bad idea. That allows
Towson to attack whiteness in the 1ac and force Louisville to defend it.
Just because the aff spoke first. -- "comparison focused debate" solves-
allows the negative to present alternative justification for all
negative ballots, but still allows Towson to speak out against
whiteness.

[7. Comparison focus captures the benefits of which side debate.
"Comparison focus" requires clash on various topics without unnecessary
restrictions]{.underline}

[8. Comparison focus forces a clash between performances rather than
allowing the aff to simply co-opt the negative performance. This is
better for debate because it allows for a more cohesive interaction
between our performances rather than one stealing the labor of the
other.]{.underline}

# \*\*\*TOPR AFFS\*\*\*

# Organ Gifting

## 1NC -- Case Turns

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Cooption

#### Its kind of ironic that the aff claims to increase autonomy while not giving those whose stories it coopts the opportunity of autonomy in whether or not their story gets shared. Just like the organs that the aff cites, they are being taken away and used for the privelege affirmative just like how the transplant tourists that they indite do. This means that any impact that they win to losing autonomy becomes a reason to vote the aff down. The reading of the aff is a double turn with the content of the affirmative. 

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Saviorism

#### The aff is a form of saviourism that re-puts marginalized people down. It creates the narrative that they would all of a sudden solve the entirety of organ trafficking and that they are the only ones that can do it from their position of privilege., The pedagogy used takes away autonomy and by assuming that autonomy doesn't exist in the first place it creates the image of the savior that reaffirms the very structure that it criticizes by justifying further colonialist violence. 

#### The aff identifies that the usage of marginalized peoples as a means in which to gather organs is a bad thing and must be refused to be accepted. However, the aff fails to make any changes to the structures that put people in positions where their only choice is to sell their own organs in the first place. By condemning an avenue in which marginalized people utilize as a method of survival, the aff is inherently further marginalizing and even criminalizing the people who have to resort to selling parts of themselves. 

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Debate not key

#### Why is this aff being read in the debate space to begin with? The aff is functionally a truth: that organ sales are bad. Why does that need to be said in the debate space? The aff has neither had their organs harvested nor are in need of an organ. Therefore, the aff being read in the debate space is not only just cooption but it also does nothing to the aff's functional ability to spill out. 

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Academia 

#### The aff has deluded themselves into thinking that their personal rhetoric shifts within in privileged spaces will do absolutely anything to help those in underprivileged spaces, recognizing that commodification is bad doesn't do anything at all to actually prevent that commodification from happing, at best there is no affirmative solvency at worst it's a form of cruel optims where they promise autonomy and then reengage in the systems that took it away.

# Trans Undercommons

## 1NC -- Case Turns

### 1NC -- Case Turn - Touching

#### Framework for the round straight up turns the aff. The undercommons is a place in which we can't touch each other or interact with each other. The 1AC's supposition of a framework for the round as the judging for whoever they feel through more is

#### Organization which is antithetical to the undercommons

#### A touch of the commons which connects those who cannot relate to those experiences

### 1NC -- Case Turn - Visibility

#### The aff's introdcution of undercommon critique into the debate round makes the undercommons visible.

#### This turns case for two reasons:

#### Making the undercommons visible betrays the maroons. If the undercommons is not always in flight and always hidden then it can be found and touched up the commons, rendering the political potential of our revolutionary project null and void.

#### The aff is the professionalization of the University -- they say all we need is a little more critical education, a little more critical pedagogy in the University, that is an active stance AGAINST the undercommons

#### The radical academic is not the same as the radical subject. The 1AC tries to use their position within the debate to criticize its current condition. But, the aff ignores that the critic is not subversive OR radical OR a fugitive. Only the alternative resolves this argument because we affirm this feeling of hapticality. We stay within the hold of the debate round---we not for and we're not against.

#### This DESTROYS their subversive educational project---there is NO SUCH THING as subversive public pedagogy.

#### To be for or against the common's biopolitical touch is a strategy of the sovereign. To be against is both the same and the opposite as to be for the University. Their strategy only results in social exclusion because of their academic commitment to dogmatism OR because the state sovereign takes them out.

#### THE COLLECTION OF THE PAIN NARRATIVES AND WOUNDED IDENTITIES BY THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH SPACES SUCH AS DEBATE, WORKS TO ALLOW FOR THE SMOOTH FUNCTIONING OF WHITENESS AND COLONIALISM. THIS ALLOWS FOR THE ACADEMY TO BE A MERE SPECTATOR. THIS POWER OF SPECTATORSHIP IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF COLONIAL VIOLENCE, THIS TURNS THE AFF. WE MUST REFUSE TO BE GAZED AT, REFUSE TO BE AN OBJECT OF RESEARCH.

#### The spectatorship that is part and parcel of the debate round makes the 1AC a narrative of pain to be consumed by academics and regurgitated by counter-revolutionaries to stifle the transformative potential of the 1AC.

#### It's not that poetry or narrations of one's own experiences are bad in a vacuum -- but their presentation in the debate round reduces important narratives to consumable objects for non-queer people to parrot, appropriate, and exploit which means that the performance and embodiment of the 1AC turns sour and the aff ends up re-entrenching the position of those in society who take an active stance against queerness.

### 1NC -- Case turn - Resiliency

#### The 1ac was a 8 minute consumable performance of resilience- they are wrong about the way the world works: the objectification suffered under anti-queerness causes psychological violence/damage but that is not MRWaSP's end goal- objectification is a resource that the affirmative has used to achieve subjectification or agency- the impact is the expansion of white-savior interventionism as a means to "save" non-resilient people or color from their scary culture of their countries.

#### The affirmative's wielding of queerness as a way to deconstruct humanism couldn't be farther off- the affirmative uses \[whatever the fuck the aff is affirming\] as a means to 'own' the damage from from racist structures, fueling the "Look, I Overcame" narrative that fuels MRWaSP and liberal humanism

### 1NC -- Case Turn - Immaterial

#### The 1AC's project of undercommon cacophony is fundamentally immaterial. The 1AC cannot help remediate the material and immediate conditions of violence that queer folks face such as sexual assault in detention centers. 

#### Lacking in material praxis is a hard solvency deficit to the aff making them nothing more than armchair leftists who claim that a little bit more pedagogy or some more hope will result in the emancipation that they're working towards when in reality the lack of addressing material problems leaves them liable for the violence and social death that they allow to continue unhindered.

#### Critiquing material problems without proposing material solutions just plays into the hands of reactionaries and bootlickers and dooms you to political irrelevance

# Black Femme Fatale

## 1NC -- Case Turn \-- Women Focus 

#### The focus on women being sex trafficked ignores the similar violence that is enacted against male or non-binary people. This erasure allows those forms of suffering to continue and maintain an air of innocence for they are perceived as not as bad as violence that happen against women.

## 1NC -- Case Turn \-- Armchair Philosophy

#### The idea that a reorientation of ourselves to consent can solve the entirety of non-consensual acts is wrong. Focusing on an ideological shift turns us into the armchair philosopher that theorizes about consent but doesn't go out and fight the people directly trafficking humans.

#### There is no mechanism to distribute this knowledge, none of it could get to people currently being trafficked and therefore the aff doesn't do shit.

#### The orientation that the public as a whole has to consent does not affect those currently being trafficked. The aff can't solve its impacts because traffickers wont just hear abot this reorientation, realize they are bad, and let everyone go.

## 1NC -- Case Turn \-- Narrative Theft

#### By using stories about victims of sex trafficking the aff is essentially stealing their stories and trauma which is not a consensual act. Thus if the communication of this paradigm necessitates taking stories from marginalized groups, the aff turns itself because, to communicate their new vision of consent, they use information that was taken unconsensually.

# Asian Femme Fatale 

## 1NC -- Case Turn

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Sex Work Good

#### The aff's method of disrupting the narrative of whiteness ignores the material implications for the Asian sex worker who depends on their job because of their poor economic status. The Asian sex worker risks losing their job and their source of income, deepening their poverty and forcing them to take desperate measures to survive. 

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Identity

#### The aff's exclusive theory focuses only on a specific identity rather than using a racialized analysis of how women of color are affected. They focus on strategies that exclude women of color who are affected by sex trafficking and prevents strategies of unified female resistance. Developing methods to resist among women of color is a pre-requisite because the aff maintains the racial divides the white man has placed. 

#### **The aff's intersectional analysis of the Asian woman creates a space of oppression Olympics where people are "graded" by society based on the social identities that they identify with.** 

**OldSimo 17** (OldSimo, August 22, 2017, "Intersectionality is Bad:
It's A Form of Fetish and Oppression Olympics", 'A Medium Corporation',
<https://medium.com/@Old_Simo/intersectionality-is-bad-its-a-form-of-fetish-and-oppression-olympics-a3f5571670b2>,
///AR) I dislike it when people use certain new wave words and terms in
arguments. Certain words and phrases erode intellectual capital. *CIS
gendered* and *Islamophobia* are at the top of the list. So is
intersectionality. Intersectionality is bad and problematic when it goes
beyond a mere academic theory. Intersectionality should never have left
the confines of academia. Unfortunately it has leaked into mainstream
society. It is a sibling to gender and identity politics. All three
combined have excelled white western guilt culture, created victimhood
fetish and furthered irrational minority fundamentalism.
Intersectionality was invented by American civil rights activist
Kimberly Williams Cremshaw. She devised it as a theory to explain how
different social identities over lap and form connection. It's the
process of multiple social identities that intersect and infuse. They
create a hybrid of "minority" or disadvantageous elements. Williams
wanted to illustrate how black women can face double doses of
discrimination by virtue of race and gender in the US. This gives white
or non black women a level of privilege not afforded to black women.
Sounds simple and accurate? This one example is simple. It reflects a
truth. However, the belief that all aspects of an individual's identity
should be taken into account is where it become complicated. [**The
theory also suggests that forms of discrimination and prejudice are all
shaped by one another.** The list of identities includes and is not
limited to: social class, ethnicity, gender, skin color, sexuality,
nationality, age, mental disability, religion, physical illness, and
mental illness.]{.underline} What happens when the black woman is also
gay, lower socioeconomic and has a physical impairment? She's no longer
viewed as an individual. She is a hybrid of disadvantageous groups. This
is used to define and categorize her. It doesn't go beyond that. It is
an aesthetical and superficial driven method. **Intersectionality is bad
beyond a mere theory because:** [Intersectionality is too ambiguous. It
has no specific parameters.]{.underline} **[The options to increase the
intersectional hybrid are endless. Where does it stop?]{.underline}**
Intersectionality has become a favourite among far leftists and minority
fundamentalists (like CIS gendered and Islamophobia). Once its taken out
of the hands of Ms Cremshaw and placed into society it becomes an empty
slogan. It's just a buzz word. We don't understand it because we don't
understand the complexities of religion, ethnicity, gender, and
sexuality. Especially groups that we don't belong to. We can't practice
it because its impractical. Most of us are too concerned with ourselves
to be interested in intersectionality. It just sounds good and makes
people feel better about themselves. Intersectionality forms an unholy
marriage with gender and identity politics. [When they intersect with
intersectionality they create two narrow prisms: villainy and
victimhood. This is where the concept of privilege also comes into
play.]{.underline} **[People are graded on the spectrum of villainy and
victimhood based on social identities.]{.underline}** For example, a
white heterosexual Christian man is as bad as it gets (villain
category). A brown, Islamic, gay woman is as good as it gets (Victimhood
category). They are graded on what they are. [The analysis is not on who
they are. This creates a feverish and irrational form of victimhood
Olympics. It all becomes about suffering. The more disadvantageous
categories you belong to, the more credibility you have. Sounds quite
masochistic. Not all forms of social oppression are linked. This is what
intersectional theory campaigners like to believe.]{.underline} These
artificial collaborations between groups share little in common apart
from a hatred of another group. Furthermore, a myopic western scope
clouded by white western guilt also comes into play. This is evident
when examining the area of religion. Because of western perceptions
(that don't extent further than the West) Christianity and Judaism are
power majority religions. There is much truth in this, but because of
this they automatically (with utmost delight) go into the villainy
category. Anyone with a Christian or Judaic identity must check their
privilege. Islam is a minority, therefore it's a consummate victim. By
virtue of this identity, the individual is placed (with utmost delight)
in the victim-hood category. These prisms don't take into account the
fact that Islam often is a power oppressor in the East. Christians and
Jews in that context become persecuted minorities. These facts ruin the
agenda. The persecution of Jewish people in the West is also ignored.
Intersectional advocates identify Jews with Israel. They are against
Israel because they see it as a colonial state persecuting Muslims. Yet
there is no outcry over the colonial Islamic state of Pakistan and the
heinous damage that caused. Since Christianity and Judaism is in the
villainy prism, third wave feminists and gays align themselves with
Islam (due to its perceived victimhood status). They have no real
understanding of the complexities and factors of the religion. its
victimhood status is enough. The disturbing part of this alliance is
that third wave feminists and gays have aligned themselves to a religion
that not only condemns them but prescribes punishments for them.
Reformed modern Christianity and Judaism do not do this.

### 1NC -- Case Turn - Cyber

#### Asian women are able to form networks and connections with other women who have shared similar experiences with sex trafficking in the cyberspace. The cyberspace is not completely dominated by the white man and his spaceship, and provides room for Asian women to empower themselves. Social movements like cyberactivism exist in the virtual world, and women are able to form such movements. This means the aff must prove why their method is uniquely better when the current cyberactivist movements can and have led to legislative action. 

**Liu 08** -- Ting Liu, Amsterdam University Press. (2008) Chinese Women
and the Cyberspace, Cyberactivism in the Women's Movement A Comparison
of Feminist Practices by Women oprganizing in Mainland China and Hong
Kong, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mvqc.15
//](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mvqc.15%20//) AR

Vegh classifies three types of online lobbying: the first is 'aimed at
one's own government's legislative body'; the second, at 'coalitions
formed around a particular issue'; and the third 'targets the government
of oppressive regimes' (Vegh 2003: 74). [Lobbying is a standard form of
advocacy in most Western democracies, and can be found among the offline
activities of Hong Kong women organizing.]{.underline} But no direct
involvement of online lobbying methods have been observed in the Hong
Kong websites selected in this research. [Lobbying practices are
relatively new to mainland China. For instance, a leader of a women's
group claims on the website that, as a civil group, it is impossible for
them to influence legislation directly.]{.underline} Current lobbying
conducted by women organizing in mainland China still concentrates on
effecting legal change offline, and **[the Internet is mainly used to
promote awareness of the groups' achievements and their offline efforts
to seek changes in the law]{.underline}**. For instance, a member of
Women Legal Aid said: 'We have submitted our amendment to the draft law
of the People's Republic of China on the protection of rights and
interests of women which can be found in our website. The ACWF, the
semi-official organization having its own funding resources just like
Labour Union, also has its amendment to the draft law. We handed in our
proposal through a certain channel. It was completed from our
perspectives and did not consult others. It would be pointless if
different versions were largely identical but just with minor
differences'. (Women Legal Aid) [Websites of women's groups in mainland
China are often used as places wherein offline lobbying practices can be
recorded]{.underline}. **[However, several examples have shown that
views spreading via the Internet do have certain influence on
governments' legislative bodies.]{.underline}** A famous instance is Sun
Zhigang's case. Sun, a young graphic designer from Wuhan, was arrested
as a vagrant on the streets of Guangzhou and beaten to death for not
carrying ID (China Daily 2003). He is perceived as a victim of the
previous chaotic management of the mobile population. After his death,
the old holding system to force urban vagrants and beggars back to their
rural or regional hometown was abolished in China, due to the strong
protests from the public (Amnesty International 2003). Voices from Web
users were certainly part of these protests and were crucial in forming
public opinions over this issue. [Not many people, though, know that a
women's group, the Sex/Gender Education Forum, contributed one of the
earliest voices to Sun's case sent out to the Web. **The difficulty of
breaking into mainstream media and the efficiency of distributing
alternative opinions in the Web partly resulted in the establishment of
the website of this women's group located at the Sun Yat-sen University,
Guangzhou. This group then started to use the Web for furthering civil
participation concerning gender issues in the region, on their own
initiative.**]{.underline} **[One instance is the Sex/Gender Education
Forums Alliance with other women's groups such as Stop DV to advocate
public awareness and legal reform in cases of domestic violence through
advancing Huang Jing's case online.]{.underline}** This advocacy has
caused some judicial modification and will be discussed later in this
chapter. The above instances indicate that successful online advocacy
usually combines different forms of activism in both real and virtual
worlds. Moreover, in most websites of women organizing, online advocacy
campaigns seem to be largely an expansion and a narration of their
offline actions.

### 1NC -- Link -- Racial Cap

#### The psychological trauma felt by the Asian woman from this structure of sex trafficking is part of a larger infrastructure of racial capitalism that relies on the exoticness and eroticist commodification of the Asian woman. Without interrogating the overarching system of racial capitalism first, the aff lacks a complete understanding of how and why commodification occurred in the first place.

[The other dimension is the understandings of the neoliberal global
political economy, which is perhaps the most evident in the modern
slavery abolitionism and celebrity humanitarianism yet which runs
through abolitionist feminism in unmarked ways. The problem of
"trafficking" --- sex or otherwise --- is, as all three campaigns
acknowledge in various ways, grounded in inequality between "the haves"
and "the have-nots" as it is the latter --- marked by poverty, gender,
and age --- who are vulnerable to force and violence in migration and
work. Global capitalism is thus acknowledged as the economic context
within which sex trafficking and modern-day slavery occurs and, although
believed to create certain problems]{.underline} (such as poverty), [is
not identified as a problem from which people need to be
freed.]{.underline} Rather a neoliberal understanding of the political
economy is upheld that takes capitalist free enterprise, individual
liberty, and private ownership as essential to human freedom (Harvey,
[2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/23322705.2015.1006120)

pp. 204--205). With such an approach, [individuals --- traffickers,
criminals, clients, pimps, corrupt immigration officers or policewomen
or men, or greedy businesspeople --- specific "bad" corporations and
companies that violate labor laws and codes of conduct, or isolated
national governments that oppose Western hegemony]{.underline} (such as
Cuba, South Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc.) [are classified as
the problem. "Deviants" to the contemporary global order and political
economy thus are singled out]{.underline}, and the task of the
anti-trafficking campaigners is to introduce more regulations [in order
to bring these "rogues" into compliance with dominant (Western,
capitalist), hegemonic standards and values. The U.S. Trafficking in
Persons]{.underline} (TIP) report, for example, [targets countries
through its annual assessment]{.underline}, the Polaris Project targets
individual states in the United States, the Walk Free Foundation
emphasizes businesses and industries, and CATW focuses on individual men
--- clients and pimps. [The results are more laws and the
criminalization of greater areas of human life and an intensification of
policing and surveillance, including more prosecutions, detentions, and
incarcerations. Yet, **this leaves the greater system that lies at the
bottom of things intact --- and indeed, capitalism is not only left
untroubled but given a boost.** One of the strategies then to end modern
slavery is by "raising unprecedented levels of capital to drive
change]{.underline}" as the Walk Free Foundation (2014, para. 1) aims to
do, or as Skinner puts it in an interview he gave on German television,
"more capit+alism is needed to bring more people out of poverty, and can
also be the most effective tool to bring people out of slavery" (Global

<http://youtu.be/niZPU4JkHBA>.View all notes Elizabeth Bernstein adds an
important comment on this: "the 'freedom' that is advocated by
contemporary abolitionists," she writes, embraces neoliberalism and
"locates all social harm outside of the institutions of corporate
capitalism and the state apparatus. In this way," she continues, "the
masculinist institutions of big business, the state and the police are
reconfigured as allies and saviors, rather than enemies, of unskilled
migrant workers, and the responsibility for slavery is shifted from
structural factors and dominant institutions onto individual deviant
men" (Bernstein,

[how]{.underline}, might we ask, [does the magic bullet of capitalism
work when capitalism itself produces the very conditions that the
campaigners are seeking to address? Did it not]{.underline}, as Eric
Williams and C. L. R. James argued more than half a century ago,
[produce slavery, racism, and colonialism that caused destruction and
underdevelopment]{.underline} in African and Asian societies? And did it
not leave the legacies that are still deeply felt today in countries
such as Haiti, which are trapped in neocolonial dependencies and debts,
as well as in black communities in the United States? Can more
capitalism undermine or reverse the power and rapaciousness of
transnational corporations that pick up and leave industrialized
countries with their regulated markets to find the cheapest labor
possible and that use their might to extract relaxations around
taxation, laws, and working conditions from the host country, creating
slavery-like conditions in the process? Is capitalism to alleviate the
damage caused by neoliberal free-trade agreements that favor the already
wealthy and powerful nations to the detriment of the weaker nations? Can
more capitalism influence the management of financial markets that work
to the benefit of the banks and their managers, stop the growing
privatization of human life and the ecology that supports it or halt the
continuous drive for greater consumption that is necessary for capital
accumulation and profit? And, along this vein, should we not ask in what
way is it possible for the neoliberal state that favors "free trade" and
few regulations on the flow of capital, technology, and goods to undo
the harms that capitalist exploitation puts in place? Is more capitalism
really the panacea to the problem of modern slavery and human
trafficking? [It is quite well established by now that several centuries
of globalizing capitalism and (neo)liberal agendas have produced the
problems that underpin the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few
and the dire circumstances for the world's majority.]{.underline} David
McNally reminds us of the vampire qualities of capitalism when he writes
"the essence of capitalist monstrosity is its transformation of human
flesh and blood into raw materials for the manic machinery of
accumulation"

mangled and worked to death, and, indeed, this has been chronicled from
European colonialism and slavery through the industrial revolution in
the Western world and into globalized modernity.]{.underline} It becomes
evident through, for example, the 2014 Credit Suisse Global Wealth
Report, which points out that "the bottom half of the global population
own less than 1% of total wealth. In sharp contrast, the richest decile
hold 87% of the world's wealth, and the top percentile alone account for
48.2% of global assets" (Credit Suisse,

p. 11). [This working of capitalism produces]{.underline}, as Kapoor
drawing heavily on the work of Slavoj Zizeck foregrounds in his
analysis, a social and economic apartheid between [the haves and the
have-nots --- the Included and Excluded. Unsurprisingly, many of the
benefits and privileges, including economic, psychic, and racial, accrue
to those already in the ranks of the Included. When brought into
conversation with the growing evidence of large numbers of people
trapped in "modern-day and sexual slavery," we see a correlation between
a rise in forced labor in sex and other industries and the ongoing
accumulation of immense wealth by a few --- that the one is happening at
the expense of the Other.]{.underline} And in light of such a
correlation, [we must ask whether a system that generates such
inequality, servitude, and exploitation can be used to fix the
problem.]{.underline} What is called among philanthropists such as
Gates, as the "big bang approach" of injecting millions of dollars into
poor communities, á la Jeffrey Sach's Millennium Villages Project in
Africa, is open to close scrutiny and a great deal of skepticism.
Charity is not, as Vanity Fair's journalist Nina Munk discovered after
following the Sachs project for six years, the same as sustainable
economic development (Munck,

but it does do the work of propelling the CEOs into the limelight and of
alleviating some of the guilt and anxiety amongst the elite whose
grotesque wealth is accumulated off the sweat and blood of millions of
others. Kapoor also concludes that the charity work of celebrities,
while perhaps bringing media attention to humanitarian crises, is
implicated in both the (re)production of Western nations as sites of
benevolence and generosity --- in the celebration of the "great nations"
of the world --- and in unquestioningly promoting capitalism by virtue
of being tied to the corporate world through their professional work,
earning some of the highest incomes globally and profiting from their
brand-image (Kapoor,

## Black Femme Fatale K

### 1NC -- Link -- Projected blackness

#### The femme fatale retains a litany of features in the western consciousness reliant on subtext rooted in colonial images of black women. The characteristics that mark the seductress derive from projections of black women as primitive and lustful.

**Caputi and Sagle '4** (Jane Caputi, Professor of Women, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at Florida Atlantic University, Laura Sagle, Director
of Composition at University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo, "Femme Noire: Dangerous
Women of Color in Popular Film and Television", Race, Gender & Class,
Vol. 11, No. 2, pp.90-111, 2004)///Aakash

In her 1994 book, Fatal Women , Linda Hart argues that, first of all,
[women of color rarely appear at all in dominant cultural
representations]{.underline}. Moreover, in a heterosexist culture, the
aggressive, predatory, criminal woman is the conventional stereotype for
the lesbian; hence, the lesbian is \"the silent escort of the violent
woman\" (x) of popular film. Hart reasons that since lesbians are almost
always represented as \"overwhelmingly white and middle-class \... the
inverted others of a white, middle-class masculine imaginary\" (xi),
[the classic femme fatale is always white. She thus restricts her
discussion to those roles.]{.underline} Conversely, Suren Lalvani
(1995), in \"Consuming the Exotic Other,\" suggests that [femme fatale
is paradigmatically a woman of color]{.underline}. Lalvani writes that
in the nineteenth century European Romantic imagination [the exotic
woman of color represented uninhibited sexuality to be enjoyed by
Western men]{.underline}. But, at the same time, \"[once her desire is
freed, that in itself poses a threat to]{.underline} the colonial
male\'s identity and the polarized categories of its constitution.
Hence, the idea of the \'Fatal Woman\'\" (Lalvani, 1995:269). [The
desired colonial territory, like the woman, is seen as available and
lush to be sure, but also: seductive, dangerous, portending even death
in terms of the effacement of \[male\] selfhood]{.underline}. Thus [the
Other woman is simultaneously trapped in the double bind of a colonial
discourse]{.underline} which either [objectifies her for a narcissistic
gaze (eroticism) or views her as potentially threatening to the western
male psyche]{.underline}\" (269). As Lalvani\'s reading indicates,
**[much of the standard imagery associated with the white femme fatale
is actually rooted in colonialist and racist projections about the woman
of color]{.underline}**. [The very characteristics that make the white
woman \"bad\" or \"noir\" are those qualities that according to a
racist/sexist viewpoint are especially endemic in women of color:
primitive emotions and lusts, violence, sexual aggression, masculinity,
lesbian tendencies, promiscuity, duplicity, treachery, contaminating
corruption, sovereignty, and so on]{.underline}. Let us consider a few
examples of the white femme noir .In The Cat People (1942), the Serbian
Irena, (Simone Simone) turns into a man-eating black panther when her
hyper-bland American husband approaches her for sex. In a restaurant,
while celebrating her marriage, she is recognized by another \"cat
woman,\" who calls out to her as \"sister.\" The lesbian and racial
subtexts are barely contained here. In Basic Instinct (1992) the room in
which the first homicide takes place is decorated with African art and
statues of jungle beasts with bared fangs. Before we meet the killer -
the white, thin, blonde, upper-class Catherine (Sharon Stone) - the
policemen at the murder scene joke that the 240-pound maid
(racistmisogynist code for a woman of color) \"did it.\" Blonde Alex
Forrest (Glenn Close) in Fatal Attraction (1987) sports a wild snaky
hairdo, which, as many commentators noted, recalls the Gorgon Medusa.
This mythic allusion obviously suggests the character\'s fatal
relationship to men, yet the Medusa also archetypally signifies, as
Alice Walker reminds us, \"the black female Goddess/Mother tadition and
culture of Africa\" (1989:269). In The Hunger (1983) Mrs. Blaelock, the
bisexual vâmpire, is played by a blonde European, Catherine Deneuve.
This centuries-old monster, however, was born in Egyptl Perhaps the most
alarming is Species . A pubescent girl, superficially a blonde, all-
American, is actually a \"halfbreed\" alien/human, the product of an
experiment with alien DNA. Her keepers, fearing a deadly outcome, decide
to kill her. She escapes and, while on a train, undergoes a
transformation, first becoming an enormous, slimy, snaky-haired monster.
At this point a Black female porter enters the room. The girl/monster
immediately subdues her. While the Black woman lies on the floor with
her legs spread, a giant hole in the monster\'s body opens and ejects an
adult white female. It is this woman who rampages through the rest of
the film as a shape-shifting creature, sometimes abeautiful blonde,
sometimes alethal monster. The visual implication is unmistakable:
subtextually, it is the Black woman who is the \"mother\" of this
white-looking but monstrous \"half-breed.\" [In all]{.underline} of
these films (reminiscent of Julie Dash\'s insight in her 1982 short film
Illusions ), [it is the hidden, background presence of the woman/lesbian
of color that gives the foregrounded white woman much of her \"voice,\"
her power, strength]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Femme Fatale normativity

#### Traditional interpretations of the femme fatale are tainted by whiteness and informed by a scholarship constituted by structural normativity 

**Da Silva 14** (Antônio Márcio da Silva, University of Surrey,
Guildford with expertise in Visual Arts, Performing Arts, World
Literatures and a pHD in Hispanic Studies, "The "Femme" Fatale in
Brazilian Cinema: Challenging Hollywood Norms", pp. 37-39)///Aakash

As already pointed out, **[imaginaries concerning the traditional femme
fatale are associated with whiteness]{.underline}**. [As a result, most
depictions of this figure in cinema and other arts have assumed that she
is Caucasian and therefore focused mainly on one aspect:
gender]{.underline}. **[The focus on gender over race indicates that
such an approach is because she is mainly a male creation as most of
these films are made by men.]{.underline}** [The femme fatale becomes a
vehicle to express male concerns about female domination]{.underline}
rather than other conflicts. Similar to what happens in cinematic
representations of this figure, **[the femme fatale's racial identity
has also been neglected in many scholarly studies]{.underline}** of
her12---[they hardly mention non-Caucasian women as femmes
fatales.]{.underline}13 Such neglect resonates with the concerns of
American feminists of color, who argue that "a primary focus on gender
erases other aspects of women's identities and experiences, including
race, sexuality, and class" (Caldwell 19). These concerns are extremely
important for reading Xica's performance as a femme fatale. **[The ways
the black femme fatale challenges colonial society's hegemonic gender
roles are essential for her subjectivity as a woman, but this aspect of
her identity cannot and should not be separated from her race,
sexuality, and social class because all these are integrated in the
constitution of her subjectivity]{.underline}**. Indeed, as McClintock
argues, race, gender, and social class "are not distinct realms of
experience that exist in complete isolation from each other" (5). [But
she also contends that they cannot be "simply yoked together
retrospectively like armatures of Lego]{.underline}" (5). For
McClintock, they exist in and through their relation to each other;
hence, she suggests that gender, race, and class should be considered
"articulated categories" (5). The author explores these three realms by
triangulating them into the intimate relations between imperial power
and resistance, money and sexuality, and race and gender. In Xica da
Silva, the way the femme fatale behaves challenges these three aspects.
[The femme fatale destabilizes hegemonic racial, gender, sexual, and
class relations as she simultaneously subverts various conventional
dichotomous pairs such as black/white, male/female, passive/active, and
slave/dominant colonial elite]{.underline}. Her "deviances" from
patriarchy's norms are, therefore, too much for the colonial society to
accept since dominant culture "can only tolerate the destabilisation of
one binary \[i.e., gender or black/white relations\] at a time" (Kaplan,
Women in Film x). Consequently, [the dominant class seeks to control the
deviant black femme fatale and it exploits her "deviances" as its
justification for annihilating her power]{.underline}. The whites'
response to Xica's behavior also reveals "the white culture's fears of
what might happen if gender and racial boundaries were not managed and
kept in place" (Kaplan, Women in Film x). Such [fears of the black femme
fatale stem from the colonial imaginary that she embodies "the glamour
and the horror of otherness]{.underline}" (Kaplan, Women in Film x).
[Glamour evokes her sexuality---her "exotic]{.underline}" appearance,
and her strength and domination over the male colonizer. **[The black
femme fatale also embodies the characteristics that the colonial society
rejects: she is a colonized black subject who possesses a threatening
sexuality]{.underline}**. [The very blackness of this Brazilian femme
fatale is a feature of her identity that shows her ambivalence: she is a
slave and as such she should be available for the white colonizer, but
she is strong enough to subvert her subaltern condition and dominate the
European "hero."]{.underline} She, therefore, contradicts the roles
imposed on her because she is a black slave woman. [Her
acts]{.underline} show that her blackness does not prevent her from
being a femme fatale and it indeed [challenges the established
construction of the femme fatale being exclusively a Caucasian
woman]{.underline}. The black femme fatale arguably becomes more
problematic than the Caucasian EuroAmerican ones because she is marked
not only by her gender and sexuality (which are the main features of the
others) but also by her race and social class. The black femme fatale
represents "the white male's projection and displacement of desire upon
the black body" (McCabe 640). Xica's blackness attracts João Fernandes
as it clearly contrasts his Portuguese wife's14 (unattractive) skin
color, which he says is "as white as curdled milk." Despite the risk of
"contamination" by Xica's "otherness" and "exoticism," the European male
colonizer cannot avoid getting involved with the black femme fatale.
This means that Xica can use the Portuguese contractor to achieve what
she wants: power. However, [this becomes a problem for the colonial
sexual order as Xica acts as a "dominatrix" who controls the colonial
males]{.underline} and turns them into her sexual playthings. As she has
sexual contact with the most powerful white men in the colony, including
the European contractor, [her]{.underline} domineering and sensual
[black body functions as "a vehicle for mediating the sexual
transgression of the white characters]{.underline}" (McCabe 647). The
way the film addresses race works as an expression of colonial racial
anxiety and as a way of forging links with sexuality and gender. The
connection between these is illustrated in the ambivalence Xica's black
body represents within the colonial context. That is, on the one hand,
her body provides pleasure, but, on the other, it generates colonial
anxieties as she is presented as a threat that is not easy to control.
The black femme fatale's body, therefore, arouses phobia among the
colonial white people who see her color as the cause of her "degenerate"
sexual behavior. For example, in a sequence in which members of the
colonial elite are having dinner at João Fernandes's house, Xica says
that a newly arrived slave who is serving Fernandes is too beautiful to
do the job and that she wants the girl as her slave so that she can keep
an eye on her. Hortência uses the opportunity to attack her rival by
saying that Xica "knows her race," by which she means that blacks are
all sexual degenerates.

### 1NC -- Alt -- Black Femme Fatale

#### A reclamation of the seductress must begin from the black femme fatale, that which reduces hegemonic masculinity and power to masochistic playthings through the degeneration of Western value schemas

**Da Silva 14** (Antônio Márcio da Silva, University of Surrey,
Guildford with expertise in Visual Arts, Performing Arts, World
Literatures and a pHD in Hispanic Studies, "The "Femme" Fatale in
Brazilian Cinema: Challenging Hollywood Norms", pp. 26-27)///Aakash

Besides dominating the males through her sexual power, [Xica causes
anxiety for the colonial elite by getting involved with men who are
against colonial rule]{.underline}, such as her owner's son José (Stepan
Nercessian) and Teodoro (Marcus Vinícius). José is involved with the
anticolonial movement known as Inconfidência Mineira, 5 while Teodoro
explores the diamond mines without permission from the ruling
authorities and refuses to pay the high taxes he owes the Portuguese
Crown. However, [despite the black femme fatale representing numerous
threats, the white European "hero,"]{.underline} João Fernandes, [cannot
avoid getting involved with her, and he provides her with whatever she
demands]{.underline}. João Fernandes's relationship with Xica
paradoxically becomes necessary for him as it reaffirms his colonizer
position in relation to the "other," that is, the colonized black femme
fatale---similar to other colonial contexts. For example, Yee points out
that [according to imperialist exoticism,]{.underline} the successful
protagonist ([the European hero) "should emerge sufficiently cleansed
and strengthened from his encounter with the revalorised colonial
subject to be able to assert his own status as hero faced with the more
pernicious exoticism of the femme fatale"]{.underline} (478). In Xica da
Silva, João [Fernandes gets involved with a femme fatale who possesses
an unrestrained sexual drive that is a test for his status as a
hero]{.underline} and a patriarchal male. However, [he fails the test
and his involvement with the "devalued]{.underline}," exotic, and
colonized [black femme fatale costs him his position of power as he
loses his post as a contractor because of this]{.underline}. Hence,
unlike what Yee states about European heroes in her study, João
Fernandes does not leave the colony as a strengthened hero. The sense of
"otherness" in Xica da Silva additionally recalls the perception of
other colonized countries that different European colonizers' discourses
have portrayed over centuries. [The image of inhabitants of such
countries has been propagated as essentially sexual]{.underline}, which
provides possibilities for the colonizer to not only fulfill his
prohibited sexual desires but also reassure his masculinity. McClintock
argues that during the Renaissance European travelers had "an eager and
lascivious audience for their spicy tales" (22). The author further
contends that [Africa and the Americas became the "porno-tropics for the
European imagination]{.underline}" and "a fantastic magic lantern of the
mind onto which Europe projected its forbidden sexual desires and fears"
(22). However, their sexual contact with nonwhite women in the colonial
setting brought risks because "[through sexual contact with women of
colour European men 'contracted' not only disease but debased
sentiments, immoral proclivities and extreme susceptibility to
decivilised states]{.underline}" (Stoler, qtd. in McClintock 48). [This
projection of prohibited desires McClintock points out is presented in
Xica da Silva through the construction of the black femme fatale as the
sexually insatiable "other" with whom the European male colonizer
releases his sexual desires]{.underline}. [She reduces him to her
passive and masochistic sexual plaything]{.underline}. Xica's sexual
behavior mirrors Doane's claim that **[unrestrained female sexuality
presents a danger to the male and to the system of signification
itself.]{.underline}** [An example of this is how Xica]{.underline},
similar to other neo-noir femmes fatales, [makes her male
counterparts]{.underline}, including João Fernandes, [violate society's
customs and laws by tempting them to have sex with her in public
spaces]{.underline}. Xica has sex with her counterparts in different
public places--- for example, with João Fernandes on the veranda of
their house, with José in the tower of the Convent of the Blacks, and
with the Portuguese count in her palace---being watched by other people
in most cases. [Her sexual behavior is a stark contrast to that of the
"good" white woman who represents patriarchy's female role model and
opposes the "shameless" black femme fatale]{.underline}.6 Hence, [Xica's
hypersexuality is "a racialised sexuality linked in this perversity to
other women of colour]{.underline} in representations such as the
African American mammy/Jezebel, the Native American squaw/ princess, and
the Chicana/Latina virgin/whore" (Shimizu 65). Additionally, [the black
femme fatale is constructed as the colonized sexual degenerate and the
"cannibalistic other"---]{.underline}the latter implied by the fact that
she bites people. For example, during a banquet João Fernandes and she
host for some members of the colonial elite, Xica bites the fingers of
the superintendent (played by Altair Lima) when she asks him if he was
still interested in her "teeth" as he had previously said. The scene is
significantly phallic and can be associated with the shouts the audience
hears from her counterparts during sexual intercourse with her. At
certain moments, they are heard howling "Not that, Xica!" about an act
they fear yet are unable to resist. [**Xica subordinates men and
exercises her sexual control over them, and this threatens their
hegemonic masculinity and power as colonial males. Moreover, from a
psychoanalytic point of view,** the males' screams reveal much: **the
female genitalia,** the vagina dentata, **can "castrate" men, so the
black femme fatale represents a threat to patriarchal colonial power
because of her dangerous sexuality.**]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Method specificity - Mimicry

#### Armed with mimicry, the black femme fatale accelerates the deconstruction of Western value systems through a carnivalesque mockery of colonial whiteness

**Da Silva 14** (Antônio Márcio da Silva, University of Surrey,

Bhabha Bhabha contends that "[mimicry]{.underline}" is ambivalent---or
in his words, [involves something that is "almost the same, but not
quite]{.underline}" (123)---**[and has a profound and disturbing effect
on the authority of colonial discourse because it "repeats rather than
re-presents]{.underline}**" (125). For example, in Xica da Silva, [the
black femme fatale uses mimicry to consolidate and maintain her power.
But her mimicry of the colonial whites is rather disturbing for them as
it is not intended to represent the colonial elite's values but to
criticize them]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} does not simply consist of
repeating the colonial authority, as Bhabha puts it, but
[is]{.underline} instead [a tool she appropriates in a conscious way to
trouble colonial authority]{.underline}. **[Xica's "repetition" of the
whites' culture implies a cannibalistic criticism of it as she
appropriates the things and beliefs white people consider to be of
value]{.underline}**, [such as clothes and consumerism, and she usurps
power from them to advance her cause. But, despite seemingly accepting
the colonial cultural matrix, she actually transforms it to a more
seemingly accepting the colonial cultural matrix]{.underline}, **[she
actually transforms it to a more genuine model that matches her identity
and makes her stronger than the ruling class.]{.underline}** For
instance, although Xica receives various goods and expensive clothes
from all over the world, she modifies them in her own way---transforming
them into "carnivalesque costumes"---before wearing them. She [ignores
her limitations and demonstrates that she is "shifty, irreverent,
willful, expansive and fully in charge of herself; she is capable of
transforming the white elite's fashion into fancy dress and their
customs into a mockery]{.underline}" (F. Ferreira n. pag.). [The black
femme fatale's cannibalistic mimicry of the whites' culture helps her to
become stronger than the colonial elite: it is through]{.underline} her
[mimicry that Xica finds a way to insert herself into the dominant
class's arena]{.underline}. The way Xica behaves echoes Bhabha's
statement that [the unintended effect of colonial discourse is "the
production of a subject whose mimicry mocks and defamiliarises the
model]{.underline}, casting doubt on its integrity and solidity" (x). In
most of the film, [the black femme fatale's mimicry is used to mock the
colonial elite members' behavior]{.underline}, particularly Hortência's
and the Portuguese count's racism. It also challenges their "integrity"
and their "solidity." For example, besides destabilizing her main rival
Hortência throughout the film, Xica's acts expose the white woman
because it shows that Hortência is not as good a role model of the
colonial patriarchal wife as she tries to advertise to society. From the
moment Xica manages to get the Portuguese contractor's attention through
her striptease, Hortência can no longer hide her interest in the
Portuguese man as from this point onward she perceives the black femme
fatale to be an impediment to her goal of seducing João Fernandes. She
is so disturbed by Xica's power over the European "hero" that by the end
of the film she behaves hysterically in public, shouting and calling
Xica names and blaming the latter for João Fernandes's enforced return
to Portugal. Hence, [Xica's cannibalistic mimicry---enacted through her
wearing clothes and accessories usually worn by the ruling class and her
mocking "copy" of their behavior---works to equalize her power to the
white elite]{.underline}. For example, early on in the film when José
asks her what she would like him to give her as a present, she says she
wants "clothes for human beings: white shoes and a white dress." [Her
yearning for white clothes and shoes implies that she sees white as
synonymous with social ascension]{.underline} and a possible means for
her to "disguise" what the whites see as her sign of inferiority: her
skin color. Indeed, after actualizing her social inversion through her
striptease, she wears white and light-colored clothes repeatedly and
uses these to show society the change in her social status. By making
use of her new clothes and accessories, [the black femme fatale seems to
"operate a performance of femininity, a masquerade, by means of an
accumulation of accessories]{.underline}---jewelry, hats, feathers,
etc.---all designed to mask \[her\] lack" (Doane 172). In other words,
[Xica deploys all these accessories and clothes to "mask" her lack of
racial equality to the colonial white elite and even her lack of a
phallus---taking into account the psychoanalytical understanding of
"lack"]{.underline} (Mulvey, Visual)---[as she is not just black but
above all a female black slave, which represents at least three
subaltern positions in the colonial context]{.underline}. Although she
acquires all the accessories and expensive clothes to which no other
woman in the colony has access and gets everything she demands from João
Fernandes, [her blackness is a trait she cannot expel from her identity.
She "performs whiteness" through her money]{.underline} and class
ascension, [but her blackness continues to serve the white elite's goal
of pushing her into a subaltern position]{.underline} within the
colonial society. For example, even after receiving her enfranchisement
letter and becoming "dona Francisca da Silva"15---as she proudly boasts
to the priest--- she is not accepted into the local church because of
her skin color. In other moments of the film, she is accused of having a
pact with the devil, which is also because of her black skin. But
[despite her "lack(s)," the black femme fatale destroys the boundaries
between her and the colonial society through mimicry. Her cannibalistic
appropriation of the whites' culture makes her stronger than the
colonial ruling class, even if this is in a carnivalesque way
only.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Method Specificity -- Cannibalism

#### The cannibalistic performance of the black femme fatale consumes the white colonial order, subverting the elite's demands through the exploitation of the normative values

**Da Silva 14** (Antônio Márcio da Silva, University of Surrey,
Guildford with expertise in Visual Arts, Performing Arts, World
Literatures and a pHD in Hispanic Studies, "The "Femme" Fatale in
Brazilian Cinema: Challenging Hollywood Norms", pp. 40-42)///Aakash

Cannibalism [The black femme fatale's cannibalism]{.underline}16
concerns how she appropriates what belongs to the dominant class to
"usurp" the power it signifies and empower herself. [Besides this, her
cannibalism can be linked to the concept of mimicry proposed by Bhabha
to show that this black femme fatale's acts are not just a mimicry of
the white people]{.underline}---a criticism the film has received (i.e.,
that Xica is "a black woman with a white soul")---but that **[her
mimicry is a cannibalistic act that she deploys for her own benefit to
acquire the position of power she desires]{.underline}**. [Her
cannibalism is suggested not only in the goods she appropriates
but]{.underline} also, and [mainly, through her sexual acts---just like
many of the other femmes fatales]{.underline}, especially the ones in
neo-noirs. Regarding sex and cannibalism, this is even more strongly
indicated by the verb "comer" (eat) in Portuguese to refer to the male
active role in copulation. Xica, for instance, "eats" the men with whom
she has sex. [She subverts the logic of comer as a male act. Her sexual
power is so strong that it causes anxieties at the same time it makes
her, and the other femmes fatales, a feared representation of
women]{.underline}. This is evident, for example, [in the term used for
the femme fatale in Mexican cinema: la devoradora ("the devouring
one").]{.underline} Such a term indicates a strong connection with
cannibalism and with the question of agency. That is, **[the femme
fatale's "cannibalism" indicates power rather than objectification: she
is feared by patriarchal society]{.underline}**. Stam (Subversive)
argues that [cannibalism represents "otherness" within Western
traditions and is "the ultimate marker of difference in a coded
opposition of]{.underline} light and dark, rational and irrational,
[civilized and savage]{.underline}" (Stam, Tropical 238). [Because of
her race, Xica's behavior is perceived by the colonial elite as a sign
of her savagery]{.underline}, shamelessness, and irrationality.
[However, she retaliates by mocking the racist behavior of the white
elite]{.underline}. [The black femme fatale]{.underline} challenges
white people's assumptions that only they are clever and allowed to give
orders, have luxuries, and live a lavish lifestyle. She shows that she
[is ready to subvert the racial and social organization that dictates
these boundaries, but this does not please the ruling
class]{.underline}. An illustration of Xica's stark criticism of the
whites occurs in the sequence in which João Fernandes and she host a
dinner for the Portuguese count. During the dinner, she appears with her
face painted in white and wearing a blond wig (see figures 1.3 and
1.4),17 bringing to mind Frantz Fanon's well-known book title Black
Skin, White Masks. 18 During the dinner, she repeatedly mocks the racist
count, who previously addressed her only as the preta ("black woman").
When the man decides to try some chicken, she tells him not to do so as
it was prepared with molho pardo19 ("brown gravy"), which is clearly a
criticism of his rampant racism as the word pardo designates mixed-race
people---the mixture of black and white (i.e., mulatto). Thus, the femme
fatale's behavior criticizes "white superiority" and recalls the white
elite's "ideology of whitening" (Stam, Cross-cultural 244) that pervaded
Brazil's social imaginary during the first decades of the twentieth
century. Hence, **[the black femme fatale performs "cannibalism" in two
ways: by consuming goods and by sexually "devouring" her
counterparts.]{.underline}** Her behavior recalls Joaquim Pedro de
Andrade's view of cannibalism. For Andrade, those who can, "eat" others
"through their consumption of products, or even more directly in their
sexual relationships. [Cannibalism has merely institutionalized itself,
cleverly disguising itself]{.underline}. The new heroes. . .try to
devour those who devour us" (83). Xica voraciously devours the European
"hero" sexually and this serves as a metaphor for the nation devouring
its own people---that is, the ruling class exploiting the lower classes.
[The black femme fatale's "cannibalistic" sexual behavior]{.underline},
signaled by her sexual counterparts' screams during their intercourse
(as if they were being eaten alive), turns her into a symbol of
otherness in the colonial society's eyes. Xica's "cannibalistic"
consumerism [implies a criticism of the colonial society's
behavior]{.underline}. Many goods João Fernandes buys for her or that
she purchases are entirely superfluous to her needs. She says that she
needs to organize processions and parties to wear all the "beautiful
things" she has received---clearly to exhibit her new status to the
colonial society. She consumes for the sake of it, as the ruling class
does. [This behavior of hers denotes that she has assimilated and is
exploiting the colonizer's values and those of the white colonial
elite]{.underline}. Her exaggerated consumerism, however, turns the
ruling class not only against her but also against João Fernandes. As a
representative of the European colonizer, João Fernandes should be
"civilizing" the "other," but he becomes more and more influenced by the
black femme fatale's behavior and power. He seemingly comes close to
becoming the colonized "other" himself. The way he deals with his
identity and virility contradicts what the patriarchal society of the
European colonial metropolis would normally expect from a European male
colonizer. That is, his identity and virility are "not autonomous or
secure." On the contrary, they are "constructed in relation to that of
the gendered ethnicised other" (Woodhull 120). But both are destabilized
because of his relationship with the colonized black femme fatale. So
instead of ensuring his virility and fulfilling the white male
colonizer's hegemonic roles, he succumbs to Xica's performance as a
femme fatale, which overpowers him and turns him into an object she
manipulates to achieve her goal of occupying a distinctive position of
power within the colonial society. Therefore, **[the black femme fatale
challenges male domination in a colonial context and subverts the
behavior that white patriarchal society dictates as the norm to a black
slave woman within this environment]{.underline}**.
[Through]{.underline} her [power as a femme fatale, this black slave
overturns the colonial positions of power and inserts herself into the
elite territory while mocking the same elite through mimicry and the
"cannibalization" of the whites' cultural values]{.underline}. Xica's
control over João Fernandes shows that "the slave (the colonized, the
black, the woman) knows the mind of the master better than the master
knows the mind of the slave" (Spence and Stam 15--16). He becomes an
example of patriarchy's "fallen-masculinity" as he fails to resist the
black femme fatale and allows her to "rule the colony" so the white
colonial elite revolts and finds a way to annihilate Xica's power and
"destroy" her. However, Xica does not allow herself to be converted and
changed into patriarchy's "good woman," even if her obstinacy results in
her downfall. She remains faithful to her sexual and gender identities,
and even after she is "destroyed" she manages to satiate her sexual
appetite. Thus, [this black femme fatale's sexuality is a very important
aspect of her identity]{.underline} and is related not only to her race
but also to her very condition as a woman, which is also the case for
other femmes fatales. Moreover, [the ways she uses her body and her
sexuality, besides challenging hegemonic sexual and gender roles, show
how important gender identity is for the femme fatale's subjectivity and
how such an identity is performatively constituted.]{.underline}

[Discourse on race normally focuses on the material and the visual, but
the video of Anna Brown's death points us less to the images and more to
the centrality of aurality to black suffering]{.underline}. The first
part of the video is without audio, but this does not mean sound is
absent per se. That the video lacks audio in the beginning says more
than perhaps the soundtrack itself could, for [it makes explicit the
inaudibility of black suffering]{.underline}. We know that [Anna Brown
had expressed her lasting pain, in spite of the doctor's opinion that
she was fine. The hospital then ordered her to leave and she protested,
saying that she was still in pain. She was forcibly wheeled to the
hallway and eventually arrested by the police.]{.underline} Her vocal
protests, critiques of inadequate service and expression of her
persistent pain, fell on deaf ears. [She spoke the knowledge of her
\[flesh\] ~~body~~, but her voice was]{.underline} muted and
[over-dubbed by the knowledge of the professionals.]{.underline} How can
the black know about itself? [How can the shadow speak
back?]{.underline} [The violence that produces the subject]{.underline}
(in this case, the doctor) [robs Anna Brown of vocality, not so much
literally as ontologically. Insofar as an object (a commodity, a slave)
can speak, it cannot be said that it can communicate]{.underline}. [At
the etymological root of "communicate" is the logic of]{.underline} the
commons or [community: informing to participate in the world, sharing
one's utterance(s) to join the community]{.underline}. Communication,
not even to imply anything as serious as the ethics of [dialogue,
requires an equal ontological status amongst the
communicators.]{.underline} That [several titles of the
video]{.underline} online have called her the "homeless woman"
[evidences one singular truth]{.underline} (the desire to insult her
notwithstanding): [Anna Brown, as the descendent of slaves, has no home
while the doctors are in their own dominion.]{.underline} In a public
lecture titled
"[People-of-Color-Blindness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVMI3oiDaI),"
[Jared Sexton describes an experience at a jazz club where the
microphones go off, but the band continues to play. Even though the
sociality between the band and the audience has been shut down, the band
still plays on. Sexton uses this example to dramatize how even though
the black is socially dead, that does not signify that black life is
non-existent]{.underline}. Instead, our [social death signifies that
black life is sealed off from the world and happens elsewhere:
"underground or in outer space."]{.underline} [In this way Anna speaks,
but the microphone that would project her subjectivity to the world has
been turned off.]{.underline} [Her suffering has been rendered unreal
while her voice is heard as incoherent and dangerous.]{.underline} If
Anna Brown's suffering is inaudible, the second half of the video speaks
to how her voice and pain are criminalized. When the police arrive, they
surround Anna and then drag her out of the wheelchair, handcuff her, and
leave her on the hospital floor. She is given two different charges: her
protests for better service are charged as "trespassing" and her
inability to walk due to her injury is charged as "resisting arrest."
When she is in the police car, the camera in the vehicle has a
microphone. When they arrive at the prison, Anna continues to tell them
she can't walk and that she needs to be in a hospital. The police
officers ignore her statements and instead oscillate between asking her
"are you going to get out" and threatening her; "you have two seconds to
\[swing your legs out\]..." Each implies that she can move her legs and
she is choosing not to. As Saidiya Hartman writes in [Scenes of
Subjection]{.underline}, "the slave was recognized as a reasoning
subject who possessed intent and rationality solely in the context of
criminal liability." [Her suffering remains inaudible, but her voice can
only be heard by the police as challenging the law, resisting arrest,
disrespecting their authority; her voice can only be heard as a
legitimizing force for their violence.]{.underline} [As they drag her
out of the car, she screams out in pain before the door is shut and her
voice becomes muffled. They carried Anna Brown to the cell and laid her
flesh ~~body~~ on the ground as if she were already a corpse; they even
refused her the dignity of lying on the bed.]{.underline} As they
stepped around her body and closed the cell door, the only sign she was
still alive were her wordless screams. Her screams pierce through my
speakers, haunting my mind but they seem to have no effect on the prison
workers. She was clearly not the first screaming body they had carried
into a cell, for they did not even take time to stop their chatter.
There is no passion, intimacy, or perverse enjoyment, just a
multicultural group of men doing their job. Anna's death is not the
"primal scene" that the beating of Aunt Hester (Frederick Douglass's
Aunt) was. [These two black women's screams are connected by the
paradigm of anti-blackness, yet their screams terrify for different
reasons. The beating of Aunt Hester is a spectacular example of the
"blood-stained gate" of the slave's subjection. While the circulation of
the Anna Brown video has given me pause, her death is more an example of
the "mundane and quotidian" terror]{.underline} that Hartman focuses on
in her text. [Brown's death was a (non)event, concealed from the world
by the walls of the prison cell]{.underline}. Without this video, only
those on the inside would have heard her screams. [Anna Brown didn't
simply pass away, she was killed, but who did it?]{.underline}
Douglass's Aunt Hester was beaten by Captain Anthony, a man who wanted
her and was jealous of her relationship to another slave. [Anna Brown
was murdered by a disparate set of (non)events where her flesh ~~body~~
shuttled between a hospital and a prison, doctors and nurses, police
officers and prison officials. There is no one person who killed her;
instead, a structure of violence murdered her. No intimacy, just cold
efficiency. Her scream was less of a sorrow song than the sharp pitch of
nu-bluez: an impossible scream to be heard from the depths of
incarceration and incapacity. Anna Brown's death was neither an event
nor a spectacle. An event signifies presence, but Anna's death is an
ethereal absence, a spirit's wail fading away like one's warm breath on
a cold day.]{.underline} If the beating of Aunt Hester demands that one
meditate on the spectacle of black suffering[, Anna Brown's screams call
for us to think of]{.underline} the aurality of agony, [the acoustics of
suffering. What are the aural mechanisms that made it impossible for
civil society to hear Anna Brown's pain? What are the technologies that
remix the tonalities of black people into criminalized
speech?]{.underline} [These thoughts on the acoustics of suffering are
not to displace the visual for the aural, but instead to theorize how
they form and invigorate each other.]{.underline} Put another way,
an[ti-blackness is a structure where (black) skin speaks for itself and
the flesh ~~body~~ it encompasses, even when the black's subjecthood is
muted]{.underline}. In the darkness of space, [one cannot hear you
scream. Focusing on acoustics can offer a different sharpening of the
cutting edge, a modality that allows us to tune into the unimaginable
frequency of black thought.]{.underline} [If it is impossible to hear
the black]{.underline} (aurality) [and for the black to speak on its own
terms]{.underline} (orality), [then to be heard]{.underline} in this
world, [we would have to break the laws of physics--ontologically
speaking.]{.underline} This is another way of saying that [the acoustics
of suffering forces us to think of the impossibilities of harmony and,
perhaps, the terrifying beauty of cacophony. In this way, the
enlightenment of the ignorant shadows would not be the key to the
future, but instead the reverberation of our revolutionary racket that
clangs through civil society. From the black hole of our subjectivity
and into the screeching noise of this parasitic world, we scream that
our lives, black life, matters until the final, paradigmatic quiet
comes.]{.underline}

https://muse.jhu.edu/book/44556//GHS-AK)

[In evoking a discourse about black entitlement]{.underline},
[Dunn\'s]{.underline} case [engages more far-reaching contemporary
debates about the rights accorded to black Americans]{.underline}. These
debates have played out in such matters as the Supreme Court\'s
upholding of the University of Michigan\'s ban on race-based college
admissions in a decision rendered in April of 2014 and in the Court\'s
earlier overturning, in June of 2013, of a key feature of the 1965
\\5ting Rights Act that required states with a history of discriminatory
voting practices to gain preapproval for changes to their voting laws.
What is being debated in these cases is how far we have progressed as a
country, given the presidency of Barack Obama and other positive social
changes, and how much weight should be granted to arguments about the
lingering legacies of America\'s racist history. But at the core of
these debates, I would submit, [is an effort to balance jouissance, to
weigh what is taken away from others in attempts to establish equality
for African Americans]{.underline}. [Trauma and Race suggests that such
a balancing act is made necessary because the racial history of America
has bound African Americans discursively to excesses
injouissance]{.underline}. Though contemporary etiquette insists that
these racialized individuals not be read differentially, African
American identity remains open to rearticulation by a historical lineage
of racial significations that, even when functioning through the
vagaries of culture, has psychological import for both Americans and
African Americans. For African Americans specifically, v[ulnerability to
dominant discourses productive of racial otherness leads also to
exposure to a psychic trauma that issues from the racial past and
repeats itself in the present through the agency of the
signifier]{.underline}. I call this trauma [the trauma of
slavery,]{.underline} and I will define it as [a continual assault on
African Americans\' fantasies of being]{.underline}. Though [this trauma
is bound to slavery]{.underline}, I will show **[that what slavery made
manifest to black Americans was the fundamental psychic condition of the
subject who, at root, is alienated from being.]{.underline}** Where
fa[ntasy and discourse mask alienation through such concepts as racial
whiteness for white Americans]{.underline}, this [alienation confronts
African Americans repeatedly through signifiers of
otherness]{.underline} that oscillate between pinning African Americans
to undeserved excesses of jouissance and binding them to notions of
inferiority that question not just their access to being but also their
very humanity. Indeed, [notions of African Americans\' relation to
excesses of jouissance, which have often expressed themselves in
American fantasies of African Americans\' hypersexuality]{.underline}
and pro[nounced physical prowess, facilitate an American readiness to
receive its own portions of jouissance]{.underline} from voyeuristic
observation of the athletic or entertaining black other and his or her
body. [At root here is an overvaluing of the black body and a minimizing
of processes that bestow an individual subjectivity and sense of being
upon African Americans]{.underline}, so that [the jouissance of being
that is allowed African Americans often serves the purpose of tying
being and otherness to the body, not primarily to a subjective
self]{.underline}. While [jouissance may be pinned to the black body as
confirmation of an opposing racial whiteness]{.underline} that is
[productive of both a sense of superiority and fears of losing ground
for numbers of white Americans]{.underline}, [African Americans often
experience through a racial identity bound to the body an inability to
separate from the excesses of a racial past.]{.underline} These
excesses, from the standpoint of African Americans, are tied to
practices of exclusion and violence that traumatically breach the
salubrious limits of both the body and the psyche. Here **[the white
subject\'s jouissance becomes the instrument of African Americans\'
confrontation with trauma]{.underline}**. Beyond the trauma to the body
that may present itself in a particular racist act, however, jouissance,
as a pleasure produced (in this case) through race, functions to link
African Americans to a trauma of slavery, repeating through racism a
primordial challenge to African Americans\' sense of being. [Dunn
disregards his role in violently instituting such a challenge,
b]{.underline}ut his [conception of the possibilities opened to him in
so doing allows us to recognize the striking, divergent psychic relation
that is held by many African Americans]{.underline} to both the racial
past and the future. Dunn, even while imprisoned and awaiting trial,
focuses on the future, \"looking forward to moving out of the south and
away from the scourge \[or the blacks\] of this country.\"27 His rather
elaborate plan for after he is set free is to hire a \"slimy civil- law
lawyer and sue\" the county of Jacksonville for \"reverse-
discrimination,\"28 use \"the settlement\" to invest in his company, and
use the business profits ensured by a \"rebounding economy\" to \"buy or
build \[his\] dream house on the river,\" a \"2-story house constructed
in a manner where \[he, a licensed pilot,\] can park a sea plane
underneath and then take off or land on the river.\"29 Dunn\'s ability
to dream of the transformation of catastrophe into profit starkly
contrasts the relation to racial trauma confronted by many African
Americans involved in, or even merely witnessing, cases such as this
one. [Where Dunn remains future oriented, for many African Americans,
what the cases of both Dunn and Zimmerman reinforce is a long historical
past of violence and trauma that extends to slavery.]{.underline} We
feel the weight of this traumatic past in the responses to these cases
that issue not only from the outspoken African American individuals who
populate the outer premises of the courts during the trials holding
signs that demand justice but also in the deeply personalized responses
to the Trayvon Martin case articulated even by the first black president
of the United States, Barack Obama. Though Obama is well known for his
emotional collectiveness and though he had rarely addressed the issue of
race in America before Martin\'s killing, upon being asked for an
impromptu comment on the case, Obama punctuates his statements with the
assertion, \"If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon\"30 Calling this
his \"main message . . . to the parents of Trayvon Martin,\" Obama
suggests his own familial and racial ties to Martin.31 What Obama\'s
response displays is the manner in which racial trauma, the excesses of
jouissance that emerge from the transgressions of others, often becomes
the source of a bond that constitutes and coheres African Americans as a
racial group. Obama, occupying the distance of the presidency and
acknowledging his necessary legal impartiality as \"the head of the
executive branch,\" is interpellated into identification equally with a
racial identity and a racial past traced in a lineage of African
American suffering.32 In this tracing, [we see a shift from past notions
of racial essentialism]{.underline}, such [that racial identity is
determined by commonalities in experience,]{.underline} by similariti[es
in the discursive relation to being that is established by a racism that
questions one\'s subjective value.]{.underline} This shift, like the
move to culture described above, defines racial similarity
throughjouissance, through a relation to modes of enjoyment and
experiences of suffering that repeat across time. After the verdict on
the case was issued, Obama spoke for a second time about Trayvon Martin,
identifying directly with Martin\'s experience. He explains, \"another
way of saying\" Trayvon Martin \"could have been my son\" is to say
\"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\"33 In an age when
race as an inherited essence is questioned and multiraciality is
abundantly visible, even in Obama himself, Obama models a shift in
American culture whereby increasingly race is determined through
relation to a historical past, the replication of which through racism
simultaneously solidifies African American racial identity and curtails
those fantasies of wholeness that define for the African American
subject a sense of access to the jouissance of being. Obama himself
notes that the restrictions placed upon African Americans, the
limitations in the space allotted to them in the American social sphere
by such factors as \"disparities in the application of our criminal
laws,\" reinforce a sense of exclusion that helps constitute a group
perspective.34 Noting that, after the Zimmerman acquittal, \"there\'s a
lot of pain\" for members of \"the African American community,\" Obama
ties this pain to the fact that the community \"is looking at this issue

#### The aff has it wrong. Black Radical Liberalism, and the explicitly legal investment it entails, is the most promising candidate for an emancipatory political theory.

**Mills 15** \[Charles, the John Evans Professor of Moral and
Intellectual Philosophy at Northwestern University, "BLACK RADICAL
LIBERALISM (and why it isn't an oxymoron)," Feb 23,
http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2015/02/black-radical-liberalism-and-why-it-isnt-an-oxymoron.html/AK47\]

["Black radical liberalism" is]{.underline} my attempt to reconstruct
from different and usually counterposed bodies of political thought what
I see as [the most promising candidate for an emancipatory African
American political theory.]{.underline} So I am less concerned with the
question of whether any African American political theorists actually
self-consciously identified what they were doing under this designation
than with the question of whether it stands up to criticism as a
plausible way forward. In taxonomies of African American/black political
thought, the standard contrast would be:1 I am arguing for [a
synthesizing, reconstructed black liberalism]{.underline} which [draws
upon the most valuable insights of the black nationalist and black
Marxist traditions, and incorporates them into a dramatically
transformed liberalism.]{.underline} So the taxonomies would now be
drawn differently: Screen Shot 2015-02-23 at 9.04.04 AM How does black
radical liberalism differ from black mainstream liberalism? By
definition they are both "liberal" in endorsing liberalism as a
political philosophy, but [black radical liberalism seeks to transform
liberalism to make it responsive to the alternative realities of the
black diasporic experience in modernity, and the correspondingly
necessary reordering of liberal normative priorities. Black radical
liberalism both (i) recognizes white supremacy as central to the making
of the United States and (more sweepingly) the modern world, and (ii)
seeks the rethinking of the categories, crucial assumptions, and
descriptive and normative frameworks of liberalism in the light of that
recognition.]{.underline} Black mainstream liberalism either (i) refuses
to recognize white supremacy (for example, by endorsing the "anomaly"
view of U.S. racism \[see Rogers Smith, Civic Ideals: Conflicting
Visions of Citizenship in US History\]) or, (ii) even if it does give
lip service to its reality, assumes nonetheless that the categories,
crucial assumptions, and descriptive and normative frameworks of
liberalism can be adopted with little change to the task of getting rid
of it. OBJECTIONS: (1) But how can Marxist and liberal insights be
reconciled? Aren't they necessarily opposed? Liberalism comes in
different varieties, and black radical liberalism would obviously be a
left-wing variety. Liberalism is opposed to state-commandist socialism,
but state-commandist socialism has proved itself to be a historical
failure, both economically and morally. Liberalism is not in principle
opposed to social democracy or market socialism. (2) But how can black
nationalist insights be reconciled either with Marxism or liberalism?
Black nationalism likewise comes in different varieties. The key insight
of the tradition, in my opinion, is the recognition of the reality and
centrality of an ontology of race, and how it shapes people and their
psychology, which can be accommodated in a modified Marxism and
liberalism. (Obviously this means rejecting essentialist versions of
black nationalism, whether onto-theological or culturalist. A "black
Marxist"/"left nationalist" tradition has long existed that addresses
these issues: see, e.g., Lucius Outlaw, Critical Social Theory in the
Interests of Black Folks.) (3) But [how can even a "black radical
liberalism"]{.underline} (assuming it doesn't fly apart from centrifugal
forces) [deal with the problems identified by]{.underline} Derrick
Bell's "racial realism," or more recent ["Afro-pessimism"? There are no
guarantees, but then no other competing ideology can offer them either.
Insofar as black radical liberalism is attentive to]{.underline} trends
within [capitalism]{.underline} (e.g., the forthcoming consolidation and
exacerbation of plutocracy in the Western world predicted by Thomas
Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century), it would hope that an
increasing number of the white poor/white working class may begin to
wake up to the reality that the prospects for their children and
grandchildren under plutocratic capitalism---albeit white-supremacist
plutocratic capitalism---are not that great either. As a materialist
political philosophy, [black radical liberalism does not rest its hopes
for social transformation on moral suasion alone, but on the
mobilization of group interests. The strategy would be to combine the
racial justice political project with a larger social justice political
project, highlighting the startling fact that the U.S. has the most
unequal distribution of income and wealth of all the Western
democracies.]{.underline} So that (very sketchily) would be the
real-world agenda. Let us now look at the (academic world) implications
for Rawlsian liberalism. CHALLENGING MAINSTREAM WHITE POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY Screen Shot 2015-02-23 at 9.10.39 AM IDEAL vs. NON-IDEAL
THEORY In A Theory of Justice Rawls famously focuses on "ideal theory,"
the normative theory of a perfectly just society, one of "strict
compliance" with its principles of justice. Ideal theory, however, was
supposed to be the necessary preliminary to properly doing non-ideal
theory, including "compensatory justice." But 40+ years later, the
transition to theorizing "compensatory justice" has still not been made,
and contemporary Rawlsian discussions of non-ideal theory are dealing
with other senses of the term. Obviously, [for a population historically
subordinated in modernity through slavery, colonialism, and Jim Crow,
non-ideal theory is the imperative. Afro-modern (as it is now called)
political philosophy is centrally shaped by the experience of
oppression, domination, exploitation, etc. So black radical liberalism
is going to be a variety of non-ideal-theory liberalism, liberalism
dealing with the overcoming of social oppression in a nominally liberal
society.]{.underline} WELL-ORDERED vs. ILL-ORDERED SOCIETIES A related
distinction is the difference between well-ordered (perfectly just) and
(what I am going to call) ill-ordered societies. Rawls suggests we think
of societies as "cooperative ventures for mutual advantage." But [a
white supremacist state is not a cooperative venture for mutual
advantage.]{.underline} To assume the cooperative-venture
characterization would be to rule racist societies out of normative
consideration from the start. So [black radical liberalism rejects such
a stipulation. Instead, it works with a conception of society broad
enough to include ill-ordered societies. Ill-ordered societies are
coercive rather than cooperative ventures, characterized by exploitation
and asymmetries of respect rather than mutual advantage and reciprocal
respect. Ill-ordered societies are, in other words, the
world.]{.underline} CORRECTIVE JUSTICE In his A Short History of
Distributive Justice, Samuel Fleischacker points out that universal
distributive justice as a norm in the Western tradition is only slightly
more than 200 years old (and of course initially really just extends
over the "universe" of white males). At first, not even white women are
included (Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract), and certainly not people
of color in Western societies (Mills, The Racial Contract). "Corrective
justice" as a concept is even more undeveloped and untheorized,
especially where groups are concerned. Basic implication: Western
normative theory in general historically for most of 2500 years, and
liberalism for most of modernity, has been complicit with rather than
condemnatory of, group subordination. The under-theorization in the
tradition of corrective justice for subordinated groups, despite the
subordination of most of the population nominally in the theory's ambit,
is itself a manifestation of this complicity. [Black radical
liberalism]{.underline} reverses these normative priorities, and [makes
corrective justice its central concern.]{.underline}

"Thoughts on Afropessimism," Critical Political Theory (2017), p. 1-8

''Afropessimism'' came out of ''Afro-pessimism.'' The elimination of the
hyphen is an important development, since it dispels ambiguity and in
effect announces a specific mode of thought. Should the hyphen remain,
the ambiguity would be between pessimistic people of African descent and
theoretical pessimism. The conjoined, theoretical term is what
proponents often have in mind in their diagnosis of what I shall call
''the black condition.'' [The appeal to a black condition is peculiarly
existential. Existentialists reject notions of human ''nature'' on the
grounds that human beings live in worlds they also construct; they
produce their socalled essence. **That does not mean, however, human
beings lack anchorage**]{.underline}. [Everyone has to start from
somewhere.]{.underline} [Existentialists call that somewhere a condition
or conditions for these reasons, and the world human beings produce or
through which we live is sometimes called ''human
reality.]{.underline}'' [Critics of existentialism often reject its
human formulation]{.underline}. Heidegger, for instance, in his ''Letter
on Humanism,'' lambasted Sartre for supposedly in effect subordinating
Being to a philosophical anthropology with dangers of anthropocentrism
(Heidegger, 1971). [Yet a philosophical understanding of culture raises
the problem of the conditions through which philosophical reflections
could emerge as meaningful. Although a human activity, a more radical
understanding of culture raises the question of the human being as the
producer of an open reality. If the human being is in the making, then
''human reality'' is never complete and is more the relations in which
such thought takes place than a claim about the thought]{.underline}.
The etymology of existence already points to these elements. From the
Latin ex sistere, ''to stand out,'' it also means to appear; against
invisibility in the stream of effects through which the human world
appears, much appears through the creative and at times alchemic force
of human thought and deed. Quarrels with and against existential thought
are many. In more recent times, they've emerged primarily from Marxists,
structuralists, and poststructuralists, even though there were, and
continue to be, many existential Marxists and even existentialists with
structuralist and poststructuralist leanings. [I begin with this tale of
philosophical abstraction to contextualize Afropessimism.]{.underline}
[Its main exemplars,]{.underline} [such as Jared Sexton and Frank
Wilderson III, emerged from academic literary theory, an area dominated
by poststructuralism even in many cases that avow
''Marxism.]{.underline}'' Sexton (2010) and Wilderson (2007) divert from
a reductive poststructuralism, however, through examining important
existential moves inaugurated, as Daniel McNeil (2011, 2012) observed,
by Fanon and his intellectual heirs. [The critical question that
Afropessimism addresses in this fusion is the viability of posed
strategies of Black liberation]{.underline}. (I'm using the capital
''B'' here to point not only to the racial designation ''black'' but
also to the nationalist one ''Black.'' Afropessimists often mean both,
since blacks and Blacks have a central and centered role in their
thought.) [The world that produced blacks and in consequence Blacks is,
for Afropessimists, a crushing, historical one whose Manichaean divide
is sustained contraries best kept segregated.]{.underline} [Worse, any
effort of mediation leads to confirmed black subordination]{.underline}.
[Overcoming this requires purging the world of antiblackness. Where
cleansing the world is unachievable, an alternative is to disarm the
force of antiblack racism. Where whites lack power over blacks, they
lose relevance]{.underline} -- [at least politically and at levels of
cultural and racial capital or hegemony]{.underline}.
[Wilderson]{.underline} (2008), for instance, [explores my concept of
''an antiblack world'' to build similar arguments. Sexton]{.underline}
(2011) [makes similar moves in his discussions of ''social
death.]{.underline}'' As this forum doesn't afford space for a long
critique, I'll offer several, non-exhaustive criticisms. [The first is
that]{.underline} [''**an** antiblack world'']{.underline} [is not
identical with ''**the** world is antiblack]{.underline}.'' [My argument
is that such a world is an antiblack racist project]{.underline}. **[It
is not the historical achievement.]{.underline}** [Its limitations
emerge from a basic fact]{.underline}: [Black people and other opponents
of such a project fought, and continue to fight, as we see today in the
#BlackLivesMatter movement and many others, against it]{.underline}.
[The same argument applies to the argument about **social
death**]{.underline}. [Such an achievement would have rendered even
these reflections stillborn. The basic premises of the Afropessimistic
argument are, then, locked in **performative
contradictions**.]{.underline} Yet, they have rhetorical force. This is
evident through the continued growth of its proponents and forums (such
as this one) devoted to it. In Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism, I argued
that there are forms of antiblack racism offered under the guise of
love, though I was writing about whites who exoticize blacks while
offering themselves as white sources of black value. Analyzed in terms
of bad faith, where one lies to oneself in an attempt to flee
displeasing truths for pleasing falsehoods, exoticists romanticize
blacks while affirming white normativity, and thus themselves, as
principals of reality. These ironic, [performative contradictions are
features of all forms of racism, where one group is elevated to godlike
status and another is pushed below that of human despite both claiming
to be human]{.underline}. [Antiblack racism offers whites self-other
relations]{.underline} (necessary for ethics) [with each other but not
so for groups forced in a ''zone of nonbeing'' below them]{.underline}.
There is asymmetry where whites stand as others who look downward to
those who are not their others or their analogues. [Antiblack racism is
thus not a problem of blacks being ''others.'' It's a problem of their
not-being-analogical-selves-and-not-evenbeing- others]{.underline}.
Fanon, in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), reminds us that [Blacks among
each other live in a world of selves and others. It is in attempted
relations with whites that these problems occur.]{.underline} Reason in
such contexts has a bad habit of walking out when Blacks enter. What are
Blacks to do? As reason cannot be forced, because that would be
''violence,'' they must ironically reason reasonably with forms of
unreasonable reason. Contradictions loom[. Racism is]{.underline}, given
these arguments, [a project of imposing non-relations as the model of
dealing with people designated ''black.]{.underline}'' In Les Damne´ de
la terre (''Damned of the Earth''), Fanon goes further and argues that
colonialism is an attempt to impose a Manichean structure of contraries
instead of a dialectical one of ongoing, human negotiation of
contradictions. The former segregates the groups; the latter emerges
from interaction. The police, he observes, are the mediator in such a
situation, as their role is force/violence instead of the human,
discursive one of politics and civility (Fanon, 1991). Such societies
draw legitimacy from Black non-existence or invisibility. Black
appearance, in other words, would be a violation of those systems. Think
of the continued blight of police, extra-judicial killings of Blacks in
those countries. [An immediate observation of many postcolonies is that
antiblack attitudes, practices, and institutions aren't exclusively
white. Black antiblack dispositions make this clear. Black antiblackness
entails Black exoticism]{.underline}. Where this exists, [Blacks
simultaneously receive Black love alongside Black rejection of agency.
Many problems follow. The absence of agency bars maturation, which would
reinforce the racial logic of Blacks as in effect wards of whites.
Without agency, ethics, liberation, maturation, politics, and
responsibility could not be possible]{.underline}. Afropessimism faces
the problem of a hidden premise of white agency versus Black incapacity.
Proponents of Afropessimism would no doubt respond that the theory
itself is a form of agency reminiscent of Fanon's famous remark that
though whites created le Ne\`gre it was les Ne\`gres who created
Ne´gritude. [Whites clearly did not create Afropessimism, which Black
liberationists should celebrate. We should avoid the
fallacy]{.underline}, however, [of confusing source with
outcome.]{.underline} [History is not short of bad ideas from good
people]{.underline}. [If intrinsically good]{.underline}, however, [each
person of African descent would become ethically and epistemologically a
switching of the Manichean contraries, which means only **changing
players instead of the game**]{.underline}. [We come]{.underline}, then,
[to the crux of the matter. If the goal of Afropessimism is
Afropessimism, its achievement would be attitudinal and, in the language
of old, stoic]{.underline} -- [in short, a symptom of antiblack
society.]{.underline} At this point, [there are several observations
that follow. The first is a diagnosis of the implications of
Afropessimism as symptom. The second examines the epistemological
implications of Afropessimism. The third is whether a disposition counts
as a political act and, if so, is it sufficient for its avowed
aims]{.underline}. There are more, but for the sake of brevity, I'll
simply focus on these. [An ironic dimension of pessimism is that it is
the other side of optimism]{.underline}. [Oddly enough, both are
connected to nihilism, which is]{.underline}, as Nietzsche (1968)
showed, [a decline of values during periods of social decay. It emerges
when people no longer want to be responsible for their actions.
Optimists expect intervention from beyond. Pessimists declare relief is
not forthcoming.]{.underline} **[Neither takes responsibility for what
is valued]{.underline}**. [The valuing, however, is what leads to the
second, epistemic point.]{.underline} [The presumption that what is at
stake is what can be known to determine what can be done is the problem.
If such knowledge were possible, the debate would be about who is
reading the evidence correctly.]{.underline} [Such judgment would be a
priori -- that is, prior to events actually unfolding. The future,
unlike transcendental conditions such as language, signs, and reality,
is, however, ex post facto: It is yet to come.]{.underline} [Facing the
future, the question isn't what will be or how do we know what will be
but instead the realization that whatever is done will be that on which
the future will depend. Rejecting optimism and pessimism, there is a
supervening alternative]{.underline}: **[political
commitment]{.underline}**. The appeal to political commitment is not
only in stream with what French existentialists call l'intellectuel
engage´ (committed intellectual) but also reaches back through the
history and existential situation of enslaved, racialized ancestors.
Many were, in truth, an existential paradox: commitment to action
without guarantees. The slave revolts, micro and macro acts of
resistance, escapes, and returns help others do the same; the cultivated
instability of plantations and other forms of enslavement, and countless
other actions, were waged against a gauntlet of forces designed to
eliminate any hope of success. The claim of colonialists and enslavers
was that the future belonged to them, not to the enslaved and the
indigenous. A result of more than 500 years of conquest and 300 years of
enslavement was also a (white) rewriting of history in which African and
First Nations' agency was, at least at the level of scholarship, nearly
erased. Yet there was resistance even in that realm, as Africana and
First Nation intellectual history and scholarship attest. Such actions
set the course for different kinds of struggle today. Such reflections
occasion meditations on the concept of failure. [Afropessimism, the
existential critique suggests, **suffers from a failure to understand
failure**]{.underline}. Consider Fanon's notion of constructive failure,
[where what doesn't initially work transforms conditions for something
new to emerge]{.underline}. To understand this argument, one must
rethink the philosophical anthropology at the heart of a specific line
of Euromodern thought on what it means to be human[. Atomistic and
individual substance]{.underline}- [based, this model, articulated by
Hobbes, Locke, and many others, is of a non-relational being that
thinks, acts, and moves along a course in which continued movement
depends on not colliding with others]{.underline}. Under that model,
[the human being is a thing that enters a system that facilitates or
obstructs its movement.]{.underline} [An alternative model, shared by
many groups across southern Africa, is a relational version of the human
being as part of a larger system of meaning.]{.underline} [Actions, from
that perspective, are not about whether ''I'' succeed but instead about
''our'' story across time]{.underline}. As relational, **[it means that
each human being is a constant negotiation of ongoing efforts to build
relationships with others]{.underline}**, [which means no one actually
enters a situation without establishing new situations of action and
meaning. Instead of entering a game, their participation requires a
different kind of project]{.underline} -- [especially where the ''game''
was premised on their exclusion]{.underline}. [Thus, where the system or
game repels initial participation, such **repulsion is a shift in the
grammar of how the system functions**, especially its dependence on
obsequious subjects]{.underline}. **[Shifted energy affords emergence of
alternatives]{.underline}**. [Kinds cannot be known before the actions
that birthed them]{.underline}. [Abstract as this sounds, it has much
**historical support**]{.underline}. Evelyn Simien (2016), in her
insightful political study Historic Firsts, examines the new set of
relations established by Shirley Chisholm's and Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaigns. [There could be no Barack Obama]{.underline}
[without such important predecessors affecting the demographics of voter
participation]{.underline}. Simien intentionally focused on the most
mainstream example of political life to illustrate this point. [Although
no exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success'' emerged from Chisholm and
Jackson's (and many others') so-called ''failure.'']{.underline} [Beyond
presidential electoral politics, there are numerous examples of how
prior, radical so-called ''failures'' transformed relationships that
facilitated other kinds of outcome. The trail goes back to the Haitian
Revolution and back to every act of resistance from Nat Turner's
Rebellion in the USA, Sharpe's in Jamaica, or Tula's in Curac¸ao and so
many other efforts for social transformation to come.]{.underline} [In
existential terms, then, many ancestors of the African diaspora
embodied]{.underline} what Søren Kierkegaard (1983) calls an
[existential paradox]{.underline}. [All the evidence around them
suggested failure and the futility of hope]{.underline}. [They first had
to make a movement of **infinite resignation**]{.underline} -- [that is,
resigning themselves to their situation]{.underline}. [Yet they must
simultaneously act against that situation. Kierkegaard called this
seemingly contradictory phenomenon ''faith,'' but that concept relates
more to a relationship with a transcendent, absolute being, which could
only be established by a ''leap,]{.underline}'' as there are no
mediations or bridge. [Ironically, if Afropessimism appeals to
transcendent intervention, it would collapse into faith.
If]{.underline}, [however, the argument rejects transcendent
intervention and **focuses on committed political action**]{.underline},
[of taking responsibility for a future that offers no guarantees, then
the movement from infinite resignation becomes **existential political
action**]{.underline}. [At this point, the crucial meditation would be
on politics and political action. An attitude of infinite resignation to
the world without the leap of committed action would simply be
pessimistic or nihilistic.]{.underline} Similarly, [an attitude of hope
or optimism about the future would lack infinite resignation. We see
here the underlying failure of the two approaches. Yet ironically, there
is a form of failure at failing in the pessimistic turn versus the
optimistic one, since if focused exclusively on resignation as the goal,
then the ''act'' of resignation would have been achieved, which,
paradoxically, would be a success; it would be a successful failing of
failure]{.underline}. [For politics to emerge]{.underline}, however,
[there are two missing elements in inward pessimistic resignation. The
first is that politics is a social phenomenon]{.underline}, [which means
**it requires the expanding options of a social world**]{.underline}.
[Turning away from the social world, though a statement about politics,
is not]{.underline}, however, [in and of itself political]{.underline}.
[The ancients from whom much western political theory or philosophy
claimed affinity had a disparaging term for individuals who resigned
themselves from political life]{.underline}: idio¯te¯s, [a private
person, one not concerned with public affairs, in a word]{.underline} --
[an idiot. I mention western political theory because that is the
hegemonic intellectual context of Afropessimism]{.underline}. We don't,
however, have to end our etymological journey in ancient Greek.
Extending our linguistic archaeology back a few thousand years, we could
examine the Middle Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption,
later taken on by the ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack
of hearing entailed isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. [The
contemporary inward resignation of seeking a form of purity from the
loathsome historical reality of racial oppression, in this reading,
collapses ultimately into a form of moralism]{.underline} (private,
normative satisfaction) [instead of public responsibility born of and
borne by action]{.underline}. [The second is the **importance of
power**]{.underline}. [Politics makes no sense without it.]{.underline}
But what is power? Eurocentric etymology points to the Latin word potis
as its source, from which came the word ''potent'' as in an omnipotent
god. If we again look back further, we will notice the Middle Kingdom
(2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word pHty, which refers to godlike
strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast Africans, even the gods'
abilities came from a source: In the Coffin Texts, HqAw or heka
activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul, spirit, or, in a word,
''magic''), which makes reality. All [this amounts to a straightforward
thesis on power as the ability with the means to make things
happen.]{.underline} [There is an alchemical quality to power. The human
world, premised on symbolic communication, brings many forms of meaning
into being, and those new meanings afford relationships that build
institutions through a world of culture,]{.underline} a phenomenon that
Freud (1989) rightly described as ''a prosthetic god.'' It is godlike
because it addresses what humanity historically sought from the gods:
protection from the elements, physical maledictions, and social forms of
misery. [Such power clearly can be abused. It is where those enabling
capacities]{.underline} (empowerment) [are pushed to the wayside in the
hording of social resources into propping up some people as gods that
the legitimating practices of cultural cum political institutions
decline and stimulate pessimism and nihilism. That institutions in the
Americas very rarely attempt establishing positive relations to Blacks
is the subtext of Afropessimism and this entire meditation.]{.underline}
[The discussion points, however, to a **demand for political
commitment**]{.underline}. [Politics itself emerges under different
names throughout the history of our species, but the one occasioning the
word ''politics'']{.underline} is from the Greek po´lis, which [refers
to ancient Hellenic city-states. It identifies specific kinds of
activities conducted inside the city-state, where order necessitated the
resolution of conflicts through rules of discourse the violation of
which could lead to (civil) war, a breaking down of relations
appropriate for ''outsiders.'']{.underline} Returning to the Fanonian
observation of selves and others, [it is clear that imposed limitations
on certain groups amounts to impeding or blocking the option of
politics]{.underline}. [Yet, as a problem occurring within the polity,
the problem short of war becomes a political one]{.underline}.
[Returning to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this: If
the problem of antiblack racism is conceded as political, where
antiblack institutions of power have]{.underline}, [as their project,
the impeding of Black power, which in effect requires barring Black
access to political institutions,]{.underline} **[then antiblack
societies are ultimately threats also to politics defined as the human
negotiation of the expansion of human capabilities or more to the point:
freedom]{.underline}**. [Anti-politics is one of the reasons why
societies in which antiblack racism is hegemonic are also those in which
racial moralizing dominates: moralizing stops at individuals at the
expense of addressing institutions the transformation of which would
make immoral individuals irrelevant.]{.underline} [**As a political
problem, it demands a political solution**. It is not accidental that
Blacks continue to be the continued exemplars of unrealized
freedom.]{.underline} As so many from Ida B. Wells-Barnett to Angela
Davis (2003) and Michelle Alexander (2010) have shown, [the expansion of
privatization and incarceration is squarely placed in a structure of
states and civil societies premised on the limitations of
freedom]{.underline} (Blacks) -- [ironically, as seen in countries such
as South Africa and the **U**nited **S**tates, in the name of
freedom]{.underline}. [That power is a facilitating or enabling
phenomenon, a functional element of the human world, a viable response
must be the **establishing of relations that reach beyond the
singularity of the body**]{.underline}. [I bring this up because
proponents of Afropessimism might object to this analysis because of its
appeal to a human world. If that world is abrogated, the site of
struggle becomes that which is patently not human]{.underline}. It is
not accidental that popular race discourse refers today to ''black
bodies,'' for instance, instead of ''black people.'' [As the human world
is discursive, social, and relational, this abandonment amounts to an
appeal to the non-relational, the incommunicability of singularity, and
appeals to the body and its reach]{.underline}. At that point, it's
perhaps the psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychoanalyst who would be
helpful, as turning radically inward offers the promise of despair,
narcissistic delusions of godliness, and, as Fanon also observed,
madness. [Even if that slippery slope were rejected, the performative
contradiction of attempting to communicate such singularity or absence
thereof requires, at least for consistency, the appropriate course of
action: silence.]{.underline} [The remaining question for
Afropessimism,]{.underline} especially those who are primarily
academics, [becomes this: Why write? It's a question for which, in both
existential and political terms,]{.underline} I don't see how an answer
could be given from an Afropessimistic perspective without the
unfortunate revelation of cynicism. [The marketability of Afropessimism
is no doubt in the immediate and **paradoxical satisfaction in
dissatisfaction it offers**]{.underline}. [We are at this point on
familiar terrain. As with ancient logical paradoxes denying the
viability of time and motion, the best option, after a moment of
immobilized reflection, is]{.underline}, eventually, [to move on, even
where the pause is itself significant as an encomium of
thought]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Pess

#### The aff's assertion that Black folks are incapable of achieving emancipation independent form white is the insinuation that Black folks are 'unfit' for emancipation and must seek permission from their oppressors to rebel is on face unethical and reason enough to reject the aff. Black radicals should always be assumed capable of actualizing their goals without the help of other movements, particularly in the context of the reducement of black folks to use value and the paradox of how black folks are simultaneously seen as lazy/unproductive and superhuman/hyper-productive.

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Yancy

#### Conceptual analysis of whiteness allows for people to obscure the reality of the white gaze and its effects. This forces white people to identify only with their relationship to the nonwhite other.

My point is twofold. First[, to restrict the problem of race to
conceptual analysis full stop is too limiting]{.underline}. second[, an
exploration of race as lived takes one beyond what is thought about in
the abstract to the level of how race is meaningfully lived as an
embodied]{.underline} and messy phenomenon. I realize that part of the
aim of conceptual analysis is precisely to unpack the messiness of race.
Yet this messiness reveals its complexity, [a complexity that often
transcends and outstrips abstract conceptual analysis.]{.underline} in
their epigraphs at the beginning of the chapter, both Fanon and Johnson
capture moments in the lived experience of blacks in an already
constituted, messy world, a world of values, of stereotypes, of being
rendered invisible or hyper-visible, of racist assumptions, racist
narratives, and embodied others. in short, then, Fanon and Johnson point
to a world of sociality. as Maurice Natanson writes, "The experience of
the self with other selves is the meaning of 'sociality.'"3 in a form of
sociality that is fundamentally structured by race and racism, [black
people, for example, undergo ontologically truncating traumatic
experiences in the face of white others who refuse to recognize their
humanity]{.underline}. In short, [blacks are reduced to their epidermis,
and so the experience of black people vis-à-vis race/racism presupposes
the existence of white others]{.underline}. I take this to be socially
axiomatic when it comes to black people in an antiblack world. Fanon
writes, "it will be seen that the black man's alienation is not an
individual question."4 When, as a black man, Fanon shouts a salutation
to the world and the world cuts away his joy and exuberance, [this
presupposes a white world---indeed, an antiblack white world---that
refuses him the sense of being at home in it.]{.underline} his
experience of alienation is one that raises the discussion to the level
of a social origin; it is not a question about his lack of constitution
or about individual psychological maladies. "The focus on the
personality of the individual," according to Cynthia Willett, "does not
come to terms with the fact that [sociality is not only a dimension of
the individual; it is the air that we breathe, the element of our
lives.]{.underline}"5 in Johnson's epigraph, when he writes about
thinking of Boolean expansions and being seen, he is writing about
[white gazes and their power to deny the internal complexity of black
subjectivity and how such gazes affect the embodied experiences of black
people.]{.underline} [Johnson's point is that white looks, which
presuppose embodied white others, challenge the complexity of his lived
subjectivity]{.underline}. This presupposes a social space of
intersubjectivity and shared intelligibility. As Ruth Frankenberg
writes, "as I, and other colleagues, have argued elsewhere, there are
times when [whiteness seems to mean only a defiant shout of 'I am not
that Other!'"6 On this score, the "I," as white, in its social
ontological constitution, is fundamentally marked through negation. The
white "I," then, is constituted within a space of relationality or
alterity. At the heart of whiteness is a profound
disavowal]{.underline}: "I am not that!" in other words, whiteness is
secured through marking what it is not. Yet what it ([whiteness) is not
(blackness in this case) is a false construction that whites themselves
have created to sustain their false sense of themselves as ontologically
superior.]{.underline} however, it is a form of superiority that
involves the subordination of their freedom. as Steve Martinot
succinctly states, ["White identity loses its freedom through its
identity-dependency on the other.]{.underline} But this dependence is
then disguised by means of a standard inversion. [The ethics of
whiteness and white supremacy determines that it is the other (a black
person, for instance) who is perceived as the source of one's felt
unfreedom."]{.underline}7 Theorizing the "dialectics" of white
racialization, John Warren writes, "[Whiteness does not persist in a
vacuum but in relation to nonwhiteness.]{.underline} By uncovering the
ways '[white' persons either identify or disavow others, one works to
uncover some of the mundane ways \[white\] people produce
race."]{.underline}8 Or as Barbara Applebaum writes, "[a \[white\]
subject's intelligibility\... is dependent on \[ontologically\] abject
\[nonwhite\] others who preserve the borders that protect one's ability
to be perceived as intelligible.]{.underline} Regulatory norms operate
through the subject who repeats and perpetuates the norms that sustain
the subject's intelligibility."9 Theorizing the issue of negation
vis-à-vis the meaning of the human qua white, Sara Ahmed writes, "[if to
be human is to be white, then to be not white is to inhabit the
negative: it is to be 'not.' The pressure of this 'not' is another way
of describing the social and existential realities of
racism]{.underline},"10 particularly in the various ways in which [black
people face lives of marginalization, exclusion, and ontological and
existential erasure.]{.underline} Indeed, i would argue that this "not"
functions as a species of the color line. When [whites slash away at
black joy, then, they install a "color line." When black bodies are
objectified by white gazes, reduced to surfaces, and stereotyped, this
too is a species of the color line being drawn. The color line, in
short, is not just a signifier of spatial demarcation, which presupposes
a racial economy of spatial management and enforcement that is
predicated on the existence]{.underline}, in this case, of [white others
who have the sociohistorical power to delimit space and thus inhibit
mobility for, say, black bodies.]{.underline} rather, the color line
also functions as a powerful demarcation that has profound negative
ontological implications for [black people and those of color vis-à-vis
whiteness. indeed, the process of racial spatialization and the process
of ontological stigmatization are mutually reinforcing.]{.underline}

#### White people occupy different, indefinite special complexities that precedes the non black other. Individual acts for antiblack violence penetrate generations and are a result of the space that they occupy.

"Look, a white!" is not simply about Carla. [nomination brings attention
to, discloses, renders ethically problematic, a network of iterative
power relations, normative assumptions, and calcified modes of being
that are created and defined by whiteness]{.underline}. it identifies
Carla's racism and [also points beyond her, signifying conditions of
subject formation that reference thousands of historical acts of
repetition, white normative assumptions, ways of being, seeing,
comporting, judging, and distancing]{.underline}---that is,
infinitesimal ways of [drawing and enforcing racial boundaries in the
lived social reality, operating within which is a white racist regime of
"truth" that "offers a framework for the scene of
recognition]{.underline}."17 in short, Carla's "recognition" of a
"little stinky nigger" and her utterance, "niggers are stinky. i can't
sleep next to one," is not an inaugural racist moment but an iterative
moment that fundamentally [speaks to preexisting white racist discursive
formations, formations that precede Carla, that render intelligible
various racist ontological assumptions and racist
utterances.]{.underline} Carla's racist utterance is indeed racist. Yet
it is not Carla who a[lone endows it with racist meaning as if from the
domain of a private language.]{.underline} as Applebaum writes, "The
speaker, by uttering the racist speech, makes 'linguistic community with
a history of speakers' [whose previous citations have invested it with
the accumulated force that enables its injurious
capacity.]{.underline}"18 in that sense, "Look, a white!" identifies and
marks both Carla's [individual enactment of whiteness and the dynamic
processes of white racist effective history that work through her. and
"since one's existence as a \[white\] subject depends on forced
repetition of norms, one's 'being' as a \[white\] subject is necessarily
complicit in the perpetuation of such norms."]{.underline}19 That nicole
comes into view as a "stinky nigger" is precisely a function of a white
orientation that Carla has already taken.20 For Carla*,* [this
orientation is expansive and colonial; it gives her a sense of
indefinite spatiality]{.underline}*.* she [is always already given the
"right" and the "absolute freedom" to demarcate her white space and to
ostracize those who don't "naturally" belong in it]{.underline}. indeed,
she comes to [inhabit the world spatially in the mode of an "ability to
do" or the "capacity to do."]{.underline} nicole, [from the perspective
of whiteness, is the usurped body; a mere object that simply occupies
space among other objects]{.underline}. Given the [hegemony of
whiteness, she may come to experience herself in the mode of an
"inability to do" or the "incapacity to do."]{.underline} in short, on
the one hand, whiteness expresses [a relation to the world in the form
of "i can"; on the other hand, blackness expresses a relation to the
world in the form of "i cannot."]{.underline}21 On this score, Barack
Obama's mantra-like campaign slogan, "Yes we can!" forces one to
question the meaning of the "we" in the expression and to problematize
the reality of "can" vis-à-vis differentially raced bodies. as a
"nigger," nicole will learn [what it means to undergo social and
psychological strangulation within white dominated spaces. she will come
to experience what it means to be deemed a problematic body, a
suspicious body, a racially profiled body.]{.underline} Theorizing how
black bodies are ontologically truncated and what this means for
phenomenology, sara ahmad writes, "a phenomenology of 'being stopped'
might take us in a different direction than one that begins with
motility[, with a body that "can do" by flowing into
space.]{.underline}"22 moreover, these different points of
phenomenological inquiry, these different ways of describing lived
experiences [that obtain relative to differentially raced bodies, drive
home the political and philosophical significance of an identity
discourse that assumes real identities that have "real-world
effects.]{.underline}"23

#### White theorist tend to ignore their positionality while engaging in theories of blackness and in turn rentrenches the hypocrisy of whiteness in relation to black identity. They participate in antiblackness in their public and private lives but never in the academy.

[i know whites (academic and intellectual types) who are able to engage
race and racism critically at the conceptual level, but appear to fail
at challenging their own whiteness at a deeply interpersonal
level.]{.underline} in other words, their [conceptual sophistication
stands side by side with a form of wanton racism that goes unexamined
because they refuse to do so.]{.underline} indeed, they [make a fetish,
either in writing or at scholarly conferences, of displaying their
self-consciousness regarding their whiteness,]{.underline} perhaps even
taking the time to offer a personal confession of it. Yet at the end of
the day [they remain covetous of positions of white power and continue
to engage in acts of racism in their daily lives, failing to engage
their own racist actions with the same enthusiasm that they bring to
theory]{.underline}. After all, there is [no necessary connection
between (a) the ability to reflect critically on white racism, even on
one's own white racism, and (b) working hard to mark and challenge one's
own racist practices]{.underline}. These [white individuals are
recognized for their scholarly work on race and racism;]{.underline}
they become tenured, acquire book contracts, receive promotions, garner
praise for their philosophical acuity and breadth in their academic
communities, [and become "intellectual leaders]{.underline}." In short[,
they do well at the level of academic "performance"]{.underline} and
academic capital returns. indeed, as writers, as productive scholars in
the areas of race/ whiteness, as creators of cultural capital, white
philosophers/scholars must not be under the illusion that, because
something has implications for their own psychological and material
sense of achievement, [they transcend their whiteness.]{.underline}
There is [no liberal, transcendent subject that engages in the cultural
production of ideas---an activity linked to larger material conditions
of productivity]{.underline}---from the economic outside, as it were.
[To write and publish in ways that are not mindful of this fact actually
reinscribes the white subject as a site of masterful yet illusory
detachment.]{.underline} Furthermore, even as [whites perform well
academically in terms of exploring white racism, their narcissism and
hegemony remain in place, remain unexamined and yet expressed in public
and private spaces.]{.underline} This is an important observation as [it
alerts black people to profound levels of white hypocrisy, ways of being
and ways of appearing.]{.underline} indeed, it is important not to
overlook the real possibility that there are some white scholars,
despite the fact that they engage in, and devote their academic careers
to, critical studies of race/ whiteness, who [self-consciously engage in
acts of white power maintenance, acts of overt racist nastiness, and
forms of institutional control that silence and marginalize the voices
of black scholars]{.underline} and scholars of color. it is in such
situations that one ought to nominate whiteness unequivocally: "Look,
damn it, a white!" [One has to ask about the "genuine" liberationist
ideals of whites.]{.underline} have watched as many [whites pursue
issues in the philosophy of race for what seems to be careerist reasons,
as a way of diversifying their scholarly profiles.]{.underline} I worry
how this might negatively impact the liberationist thrust of critical
race discourses.25 Of course, careerism is not logically incompatible
with liberationism. Yet there is something problematic about whites
doing this. it reeks of pure opportunism. related to this concern of
pure opportunism is the fear [that white philosophers will approach the
problem of race/whiteness as a mere intellectual pursuit]{.underline}.
as Zeus Leonardo and Ronald K. porter write, "[Whites often conceive of
race talks as intellectually stimulating---as in a discovery or another
topic in which they can excel---rather than a lived experience that
\[people\] of color in good faith share with their white
colleagues]{.underline}."26 in other words, rather than approaching the
problem of race/whiteness as a lived experience, as a site of shared
vulnerability, as a site of differential cash value, my fear is that
[white philosophers will treat critical discourses around race/whiteness
as sites of intellectual mastery, as forms of mastery that do not
involve deep personal risk, like being able to rattle off various
philosophical movements and thinkers]{.underline} (from, say, Thales to
Jacques Derrida) [in Western philosophy]{.underline}. The problem that I
delineate here with white theorists regarding race and whiteness reminds
me of David J. Kahane's observations that, when he teaches the work of
Catherine MacKinnon, many of his students, primarily male, seem to be
able to engage her work on eroticized domination without any risk to
themselves as gendered beings but "as [propositional knowledge only,
without taking her views as possibly speaking profoundly to themselves,
to privileges and harms in their own lives and the lives of those around
them]{.underline}, and to changes the analysis enables or requires."28

####  "Antiracist" white people cannot ever detatch themselves from the white spaces that they occupy. While white bodies have time to discover the complexitites of racism, niggas are continually facing the same impacts.

The white student's objection raised the issue of how white
interlocutors, when in discussions involving race and racism, may (more
than they realize) [deploy theory as a way of not being forced to
examine aspects of their own white subject position.]{.underline}
Indeed, [the deployment of theory can function as a form of bad faith.
Whiteness, after all, is a master of concealment]{.underline}; it is
insidiously embedded within responses, reactions, good intentions,
postural gestures, denials, and structural and material orders.
Etymologically, the word "[insidious" (insidiae) means to ambush---a
powerful metaphor, as it brings to mind images and scenarios of being
snared and trapped unexpectedly. Whiteness as a form of ambushing is not
an anomaly.]{.underline} The [operations of whiteness are by no means
completely transparent.]{.underline} This is partly what it means to say
that whiteness is insidious. The moment a white person claims to have
arrived, he/she often undergoes a surprise attack, a form of attack that
points to [how whiteness ensnares even as one strives to fight against
racism]{.underline}. Shannon Sullivan states, "Rather than rest assured
that she is effectively fighting white privilege, when engaging in
[resistance a person needs to continually be questioning the effects of
her activism on both self and world]{.underline}."3 Although there are
many white antiracists who do fight and will continue to fight against
the operations of white power, and while it is true that [the regulatory
power of whiteness will invariably attempt to undermine such
efforts]{.underline}, it is important that white antiracists realize how
much is at stake. [While antiracist whites take time to get their shit
together, a luxury that is a species of privilege, Black bodies and
bodies of color continue to suffer, their bodies cry out for the
political and existential urgency for the immediate undoing of the
oppressive operations of whiteness.]{.underline} Here, the very notion
of the temporal gets racialized. My point here is that even as [whites
take the time to theorize the complexity of whiteness, revealing its
various modes of resistance to radical transformation, Black bodies
continue to endure tremendous pain and suffering]{.underline}. Doing
[theory in the service of undoing whiteness comes with its own snares
and seductions, its own comfort zones, and reinscription of
distances]{.underline}. [Whites who deploy theory in the service of
fighting against white racism must caution against the seduction of
white narcissism, the recentering of whiteness,]{.underline} even if it
is the object of critical reflection, and, hence, [the process of
sequestration from the real world of weeping, suffering, and traumatized
Black bodies impacted by the operations of white power.]{.underline} As
[antiracist whites continue to make mistakes]{.underline} and continue
to falter in the face of institutional interpellation and habituated
racist reflexes, tomorrow, a [Black body will be murdered as it
innocently reaches for its wallet]{.underline}. The sheer weight of this
reality mocks the patience of theory. Jane Lazarre, a white Jewish
mother of "interracial" sons, relates the story of how one of her son's
Black friends was harassed right outside her home by police who thought
the car he was driving was stolen. Lazarre shouted, "But this is
unbelievable!"4 Her son responded angrily, reminding her that being
stopped by police and questioned because he is driving a nice-looking
car is something that happens to him all the time. After all, he is a
Black man and as such suspect a priori. Lazarre, while certainly
committed to fighting against an anti-Black racist world, was ambushed.
As white, as privileged, she can remain innocent of such travesties. Her
state of disbelief as she later realizes, "[signifies the vast space of
white blindness to the dailiness of racism]{.underline}."5 Lazarre
became aware that she was ambushed by her whiteness, as she realized
that [her subject position is productive of a form of
ignorance]{.underline}. While antiracist activist Tim Wise continues to
make a conscious effort at eradicating racism, he realizes how [trapped
he is within the vortex of white power and how whiteness waylays the
white self even as one fights against racism with all good
intentions.]{.underline} He relates a story that gets at the core of how
racism operates in very insidious ways. In 2003, he boarded a 737 headed
to St. Louis. He notes, "I glanced into the cockpit . . . and there I
saw something I had never seen before in all the years I had been
flying: not one but two black pilots at the controls of the plane."6
Despite all the antiracist work that he had done, Wise admits that he
thought: "Oh my God, can these guys fly this plane?"7 Wise points out
that what he knew to be true was of little help. In short, Wise was
[ambushed by whiteness.]{.underline} This example points to how [racism
is embedded within one's embodied habitual engagement with the social
world and how it is weaved within the unconscious, impacting everyday
mundane transactions.]{.underline} This raises the issue of the sheer
magnitude of the work that is necessary to challenge the insidious
nature of racism. It points to how racism eats away, as W . E. B. Du
Bois might say, at the souls of white folk. Wise tells another story, of
his grandmother, Maw Maw, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He
shares the horrible narrative of the last stages of her life, how Maw
Maw began "to forget who people were, confusing me with my father on a
pretty much permanent basis." Wise poses this important question: "What
does a little old lady with Alzheimer's tell us about whiteness in
America?"8 He makes a point of sharing with his readers that she was
antiracist and tried to teach this to his parents and by extension to
him. What makes the story even more tragic is that her father was a
member of the Ku Klux Klan. He eventually quit the Klan because of her
antiracist fortitude. After all, at age fifteen, she had fallen in love
with Leo Wise, who was Jewish. Wise provides these details in order to
give readers an example of the degrading magnitude involved in the
insidious nature of racism and how it wounds the soul. As her condition
worsened, she forgot her former self, which is one of the powerful
tragedies of Alzheimer's. She began to call her nurses "niggers." Wise
explains: "She could not go to the bathroom by herself. She could not
recognize a glass of water for what it was. But she could recognize a
nigger. America had seen to that, and no disease would strip her of that
memory. Indeed, it would be one of the last words I would hear her say,
before finally she stopped talking at all."9 [As has been argued
throughout this book, whiteness is a powerful embodied form of
being-in-theworld, where "ignorance of white domination is not just an
empty gap in knowledge nor the product of a mere epistemological
oversight.]{.underline}"10 One might say that being [a white antiracist
is never completely in one's control because such an identity is
deferred by the sheer complexity of the fact that one is never
self-transparent, that one is ensconced within structural and material
power racial hierarchies, that the white body is constituted by racist
habits that create a form of racist inertia even as the white body
attempts to undermine its somatic normativity, and that the white self
undergoes processes of interpellation even as the white self engages in
agential acts of racist disruption]{.underline}. This does not mean,
though, that all is hopeless or, as one white student commented, that
"since racism is so powerful that we \[whites\] just might as well be
racists." One ought to [exercise vigilance and DuBoisian "long siege"
even while complicity with whiteness is still possible or precisely
because one is always already complicit with whiteness.]{.underline}

**Jones 04** -- (August 2004, Branwen Gruffydd, PhD in Development
Studies from the University of Sussex, Senior Lecturer in International
Political Economy at Goldsmiths University of London, "From Eurocentrism
to Epistemological Internationalism: power, knowledge and objectivity in
International Relations," Paper presented at Theorising Ontology, Annual
Conference of the International Association for Critical Realism,

\
The 'common-sense' view pervading recent discussions of epistemology,
ontology and methodology in IR asserts that objectivity implies
value-free neutrality. However, objective social inquiry has an inherent
tendency to be critical, in various senses. To the extent that objective
knowledge provides a better and more adequate account of reality than
other ideas, such knowledge is inherently critical (implicitly or
explicitly) of those ideas . In other words critical social inquiry does
not (or not only) manifest its 'criticalness' through self-claimed
labels of being critical or siding with the oppressed, but through the
substantive critique of prevailing ideas. Objective social knowledge
constitutes a specific form of criticism: explanatory critique. The
critique of dominant ideas or ideologies is elaborated through providing
a more adequate explanation of aspects of the world, and in so doing
exposing what is wrong with the dominant ideology. This may also entail
revealing the social conditions which give rise to ideologies, thus
exposing the necessary and causal relation between particular social
relations and particular ideological conceptions. In societies which are
constituted by unequal structures of social relations giving rise to
unequal power and conflicting interests, the reproduction of those
structured relations is in the interests of the powerful, whereas
transformation of existing structured relations is in the interests of
the weak. Because ideas inform social action they are casually
efficacious either in securing the reproduction of existing social
relations (usually as an unintended consequence of social practice), or
in informing social action aimed at transforming social relations. This
is why ideas cannot be 'neutral'. Ideas which provide a
misrepresentation of the nature of society, the causes of unequal social
conditions, and the conflicting interests of the weak and powerful, will
tend to help secure the reproduction of prevailing social relations.
Ideas which provide a more adequate account of the way society is
structured and how structured social relations produce concrete
conditions of inequality and exploitation can potentially inform efforts
to change those social relations. In this sense, ideas which are false
are ideological and, in serving to promote the reproduction of the
status quo and avoid attempts at radical change, are in the interests of
the powerful. An account which is objective will contradict ideological
ideas, implicitly or explicitly criticising them for their false or
flawed accounts of reality. The criticism here arises not, or not only,
from pointing out the coincidence between ideologies and the interests
of the powerful, nor from a prior normative stance of solidarity with
the oppressed, but from exposing the flaws in dominant ideologies
through a more adequate account of the nature and causes of social
conditions . A normative commitment to the oppressed must entail a
commitment to truth and objectivity, because true ideas are in the
interest of the oppressed, false ideas are in the interest of the
oppressors. In other words, the best way to declare solidarity with the
oppressed is to declare one's commitment to objective inquiry . As
Nzongola-Ntalaja (1986: 10) has put it: It is a question of whether one
analyses society from the standpoint of the dominant groups, who have a
vested interest in mystifying the way society works, or from the
standpoint of ordinary people, who have nothing to lose from truthful
analyses of their predicament. The philosophical realist theory of
science, objectivity and explanatory critique thus provides an
alternative response to the relationship between knowledge and power.
Instead of choosing perspectives on the basis of our ethical commitment
to the cause of the oppressed and to emancipatory social change, we
should choose between contending ideas on the basis of which provides a
better account of objective social reality. This will inherently provide
a critique of the ideologies which, by virtue of their flawed account of
the social world, serve the interests of the powerful. Exemplars of
explanatory critique in International Relations are provided in the work
of scholars such as Siba Grovogui, James Gathii, Anthony Anghie,
Bhupinder Chimni, Jacques Depelchin, Hilbourne Watson, Robert Vitalis,
Sankaran Krishna, Michel-Rolph Trouillot. Their work provides critiques
of central categories, theories and discourses in the theory and
practice of IR and narratives of world history, including assumptions
about sovereignty, international society, international law, global
governance, the nature of the state. They expose the ideological and
racialised nature of central aspects of IR through a critical
examination of both the long historical trajectory of imperial
ideologies regarding colonized peoples, and the actual practices of
colonialism and decolonisation in the constitution of international
orders and local social conditions. Their work identifies the flaws in
current ideas by revealing how they systematically misrepresent or
ignore the actual history of social change in Africa, the Caribbean and
other regions of the Third World, both past and present -- during both
colonial and neo-colonial periods of the imperial world order. Their
work reveals how racism, violence, exploitation and dispossession,
colonialism and neo-colonialism have been central to the making of
contemporary international order and contemporary doctrines of
international law, sovereignty and rights, and how such themes are
glaring in their absence from histories and theories of international
relations and international history. Objective social knowledge which
accurately depicts and explains social reality has these qualities by
virtue of its relation to its object, not its subject. As Collier
argues, "The science/ideology distinction is an epistemological one, not
a social one." (Collier 1979: 60). So, for example, in the work of
Grovogui, Gathii and Depelchin, the general perspective and knowledge of
conditions in and the history of Africa might be due largely to the
African social origins of the authors. However the judgement that their
accounts are superior to those of mainstream IR rests not on the fact
that the authors are African, but on the greater adequacy of their
accounts with respect to the actual historical and contemporary
production of conditions and change in Africa and elsewhere in the Third
World. The criteria for choosing their accounts over others derives from
the relation between the ideas and their objects (what they are about),
not from the relation between the ideas and their subjects (who produced
them). It is vital to retain explicitly some commitment to objectivity
in social inquiry, to the notion that the proper criterion for judging
ideas about the world lies in what they say about the world, not whose
ideas they are. A fundamental problem which underlies the origin and
reproduction of IR's eurocentricity is the overwhelming dominance of
ideas produced in and by the west, and the wilful and determined
silencing of the voices and histories of the colonised. But the result
of this fundamental problem is flawed knowledge about the world.
Eurocentricity is therefore a dual problem concerning both the authors
and the content of knowledge, and cannot be resolved through normative
commitments alone. It is not only the voices of the colonised, but the
histories of colonialism, which have been glaring in their absence from
the discipline of International Relations. Overcoming eurocentricity
therefore requires not only concerted effort from the centre to create
space and listen to hitherto marginalised voices, but also commitment to
correcting the flaws in prevailing knowledge -- and it is not only 'the
Other' who can and should elaborate this critique. A vitally important
implication of objectivity is that it is the responsibility of European
and American, just as much as non-American or nonEuropean scholars, to
decolonise IR. The importance of objectivity in social inquiry defended
here can perhaps be seen as a form of epistemological internationalism.
It is not necessary to be African to attempt to tell a more accurate
account of the history of Europe's role in the making of the
contemporary Africa and the rest of the world, for example, or to write
counter-histories of 'the expansion of international society' which
detail the systematic barbarity of so-called Western civilisation. It is
not necessary to have been colonised to recognise and document the
violence, racism, genocide and dispossession which have characterised
European expansion over five hundred years.

### 1NC -- Case Turn - White/ Black Binary bad

#### The aff's focus on a binary of white and black ignores other narratives forcing to be formed either in relation to white/black narratives or juxtaposed to them removing their nuance and specific analysis.

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- No IL to Ptx

#### The aff depends on transformative politics to solve which isn't necessitated by knowledge production. There is so much literature out there on anti-blackness analysis and that has been written on anti-blackness analysis which has not led to transformative politics.

### 1NC -- Case Turn - CTP

#### By ignoring the possibility of state action, you give up the state to the right and exacerbate state violence and ensures reactionary politics. This is particularly true in the case of prison abolition -- combating the violence of prison requires a proliferation of tactics -- the aff's moralizing about the state prevents real action to free incarcerated people.

Incandescent **[Resilience A method for overcoming
melancholia]{.underline}** (97), [potentiality is a way of bouncing back
from the damage wrought by modern white supremacist
patriarchy]{.underline}. For white men, this damage manifests as what
Robert Gooding Williams calls skeptical melancholy (54), or alienation
from embodied receptivity; for women and nonwhites, it manifests as
melancholic muteness, immanence rather than alienation.8 The women
writers Ziarek studies rework this damaging immanence into ecstatic
incandescence, effecting an aesthetic transformation of loss into art s
own shining possibilities (115). [This incandescence is a two-step
process: the artist first performs her damage]{.underline} (sparking a
fire) [so that she can then be seen to overcome it]{.underline}
(radiating beyond her past inertia). **[Neoliberalism co-opts this
incandescence]{.underline}** (or at least the most visible, legible part
of its spectrum), domesticating its critical force into the means of
producing aesthetic pleasure and reproducing social normativity.
**[Potentiality has been upgraded into resilience.9 In resilient art,
formal experimentation cultivates, or incite]{.underline}**s (to use a
more Foucaultian term), shocks and feeds the resultant shockwaves back
into the system.10 This feedback supports rather than destabilizes
hegemonic institutions. The aesthetic damage through which modernist art
established its heteronomous/ autonomous position of
critique---stuttering, fragmented, degraded, aleatory, dissonant---is
now the very medium of normalization.11 Neoliberal resilience, in other
words, is a method or process of recycling modernist damage. For
example, if modernist art invested aesthetic pleasure in the
objectification of women (what Laura Mulvey famously calls scopophilia),
neoliberal art invests aesthetic pleasure in women s spectacular
assumption of subjectivity---what Ziarek calls incandescence. If in
modernity we liked doing damage to women, we now like to see women
overcome that damage.12 This means that [**we expect women to perform
their damage as a baseline from which good women then progress**. That
damage is the fuel for incandescent fires, so it must be constantly
incited and invoked so that there s something for incandescent women to
ignite. In this way**, resilience discourse normalizes traditional
patriarchal** damage]{.underline} (e.g., the damage of exclusion and
objectification) as a systemic or background condition that individual
women are then responsible for overcoming. Undoing \[. . .\] feminism
while simultaneously appearing to be engaging in a wellinformed and even
well-intended response to feminism (McRobbie 1), resilient incandescence
is quintessentially postfeminist. [We]{.underline}, the audience, [use
our identification with the resilient heroine as a way to disidentify
with and]{.underline} (supposedly) [transgress the imperatives of
modernist patriarchy.]{.underline} This is why, as Ziarek explains,
audiences have a sympathetic identification with subversive femininity,
with the mother avenging the murderous sacrifice of her daughter for
political ends, rather than with the murderous father/king (104[). We
enjoy women s spectacular subjectivization]{.underline} (i.e., their
overcoming of scopophilic objectification) [because this distances us
from unfashionable patriarchal formations and tastes]{.underline} (i.e.,
this latter scopophilia). In postfeminist neoliberalism, bearing witness
to both the destruction of women s artistic capacities and women s
revolutionary aspirations (5) becomes a source of aesthetic pleasure not
because it s revolutionary, but because it s normative. [To use Jack
Halberstam s term, **we like our women to go gaga because this
incandescence**, this unpredictable feminine]{.underline} (114)
methodology allows us to eke even more light out of otherwise exhausted
enlightenment modernity. If we ve reached, as Ziarek discusses, the
so-called end of art and the end of history (and the end of tonality and
the end of representation and, well, the end of modernity), then the
only way to find more resources is, like Pixar s wall-e, by sifting
through our vast piles of waste. And in that waste heap is abject
femininity (what musicologist Susan Cook calls the feminized abject
popular [). Femininity is abject because its exclusion from patriarchy
is what constitutes patriarchy as a coherent system]{.underline}. In
both Ziarek s aesthetics of potentiality and in resilience discourse,
women artists do the cultural work of remaking abjection or constitutive
exclusion into ecstatic radiance.13 In the former case, that work is
revolutionary; in the latter case, that work normalizes. **[Resilience
discourse transposes feminist revolution into a nationalist,
patriarchal, white supremacist practice]{.underline}**. Take, for
example, Katy Perry s Firework, in which the lyrics trace the affective
journey from dejection to radiant exceptionality[. The song begins by
asking listeners to identify with feelings of irrelevance, weakness,
loneliness, and hopelessness; it posits and affirms damage, suffering,
and pain]{.underline}. But then Perry s narrator argues that in spite
and perhaps because of this damage, the listener has precisely the means
to connect to others, to make a difference, to have hope: \[T\]here s a
spark in you / You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine. She
uses the metaphor of fireworks (and their association with u.s.
Independence Day celebrations) to describe the listener s
self-transformation from black dust to shining light: you may feel like
trash, but if you can just light yourself on fire, that trash will burn
with a dazzling radiance that lights up the sky, just as it lights up
audiences faces. Here[, Perry transforms abjection---feeling like trash,
unmoored, socially dead---into incandescent triumph.]{.underline} In the
song, the addressee s personal triumph evokes u.s. nationalist
narratives of overcoming colonization (i.e., the Declaration of
Independence, celebrated on the Fourth of July). Feminine
incandescence---the transformation of waste and melancholy into glowing
potential---is no longer revolutionary. Not only parallel to u.s.
nationalism, it is the very means for reproducing normativity. [In
resilience discourse, wild and crazy femmes---like, say, Ke\$ha---
reproduce normativity in the same way that deregulatory economic
practices do]{.underline} (see Cardenas). Unlike Kant s genius, who
gives laws and generates order (i.e., regulation, giving a law) out of
unruly materiality, the incandescent, gaga femme amplifies what feels
like disorder by resignif\[ying\] damaged bodies and objects previously
expelled from the realm of meaning (6). And to do this, incandescent
femme geniuses use a specific type of experimentation, what Ziarek calls
a dynamic model of interrelation between literary form and material
elements of the work of art (6). This dynamic interaction between
large-scale form and material details produces effects that are
unpredictable and unforeseeable (Adorno qtd. in Ziarek 114).
Experimental methods produce aleatory results.14 Neoliberalism, however,
has systematized the aleatory; deregulatory practices are designed to
control background conditions so that dynamic interactions between form
and material produce a range of superficially random outcomes.15
**[Deregulation turns experimentation into the means of
capitalist/hegemonic production.]{.underline}** Brilliant gaga ecstasy
is what fuels economic and social reproduction.16 So even though
incandescent potentiality might be the very opposite of the traffic in
women (Ziarek 119) figured as the exchange of commodities (e.g., in
Irigaray and Rubin), it is quite consistent with neoliberal political
and aesthetic economies. Who radiates with potentiality more than the
resilient, entrepreneurial postfeminist woman? In the same way that
feminized, blackened receptivity was the solution to modernist anxieties
about alienation (e.g., the aforementioned Gooding-Williams), feminized,
racially nonwhite resilience is taken as a solution to the problem of
the end of art. Having transgressed all limits and prohibitions---for
example, emancipating dissonance, making music out of noise---modernist
art had no means of establishing its opposition to society/social
normativity. Similarly, [**capitalism had colonized the globe,
exhausting its ability to profit through simple expansion; with no new
markets, with nothing else new to conquer**, it needed a new method for
generating surplus value]{.underline}. As Jeffery Nealon and others
argue, capitalism has become a logic of investment and intensity.
Instead of expanding and assimilating, it recycles waste and increases
efficiencies. [Thus, traditionally non- or devalued women s work becomes
the fastest growing sector of the service-and-care-work
economy.]{.underline} And women s art-making practices become the
hottest new thing in the art world: think of all the feminist art
retrospectives and exhibits that have taken place in the past five or so
years. [Modernism s constitutive outside becomes neoliberalism s bread
and butter; or, the abject is now central to the means of capital,
political, and aesthetic production.17 Because it so clearly describes
what gets co-opted and domesticated,]{.underline} Ziarek s account of
modernist feminist aesthetics provides the foundation for theorizing
neoliberal postfeminist art and politics. [But it also provides a
possible avenue for contemporary feminist aesthetic and political
responses to resilience]{.underline}. It points us to some of the
feminist frequencies that resilience discourse obscures: the melancholic
end of the spectrum, so to speak, rather than the incandescent. How
might we upgrade Ziarek s theory of melancholic art so that it functions
like a queered resilience, resilience gone wrong, resilience that puts
us out of phase with social normativity?18

### 1NC -- Case Turn - Sentiment

#### Sentimentality Turn -- The use of shared experiences of the 1AC reintrenchs the individuals exposed to violence as subject positions. 

**Berlant 98**, Lauren. (Lauren Berlant is is the George M. Pullman
Distinguished Service Professor ofEnglish at the University of Chicago,
where she has been teaching since 1984. Berlant received her Ph.D. from
Cornell University. Poor Eliza. American Literature, vol. 70, no. 3,

In the genealogy we have been tracking, sentimental modes are tactically
appropriated to produce political worlds and citizen-subjects who are
regulated by the natural justice that is generated by suffering and
trauma. But the Uncle Tom form has also engendered a parallel universe
of textual resistance-to the Uncle Tom form itself. [First and foremost,
this constellation of dissident texts refuses to reproduce the
fascinated pleasure-in-violence so spectacularly hardwired into the
white and U.S.- identified memory of slavery, even when that memory is
used reparatively to express white guilt or national
apology.]{.underline} The use of the Uncle Tom form against its
fundamental claims involves a refusal to elevate the ethic of personal
sacrifice, suffering, and mourning over a politically \"interested\"
will to socially transformative action; and it repudiates a tendency to
use self-exonerating rhetorical distractions like slapstick, romance, or
tragedy to draw a self-critical boundary between an \"enlightened\"
present and an unfortunate past[. An author\'s or text\'s refusal to
reproduce the sublimation of subaltern struggles into conventions of
narrative satisfaction and redemptive fantasy might be called
\"postsentimentality,]{.underline}\" a resistant strain of the
sentimental domain. Plots in this mode remain saturated by the ideal of
a \"one people\" that can absorb all difference and struggle into a
sponge of true feeling. That metacultural ideal of liberal empathy is so
embedded in the horizon of ethico- political fantasy that alternative
models-for example, those that do not track power in terms of its
subjective effects-can seem inhuman, hollow, and irrelevant to the ways
people experience optimism and powerlessness in ordinary life.
Postsentimental narratives are lacerated by ambivalence: they struggle
constantly with their own attachment to the promise of unconflictedness
and intimacy with which the U.S. sentimental tradition gifts its
politically exhausted and cynically extended citizens. Tableaux of
effective domestic pedagogy, moral praxis, and sheer peace dominate
narratives that exemplify concepts of justice and freedom in tales of
personal destiny. How to deprivatize politics without merely demonizing
the fantasy state liberalism proposes? What distinguishes these critical
texts are the startling ways they struggle to encounter the Uncle Tom
form without reproducing it, declining to pay the inheritance tax. The
postsentimental does not involve an aesthetic disruption to the contract
sentimentality makes between its texts and readers -that proper reading
will lead to better feeling and therefore to a better self. What changes
is the place of repetition in this contract, a crisis frequently
thematized in formal aesthetic and generational terms. In its
traditional and political modalities, [the sentimental promises that in
a just world a consensus will already exist about what constitutes
uplift, amelioration, and emancipation, those horizons toward which
empathy powerfully directs itself.]{.underline} Identification with
suffering, the ethical response to the sentimental plot, leads to its
repetition in the audience and thus to a generally held view about what
transformations would bring the good life into being. **[This
presumption, that the terms of consent are trans historical once true
feeling is shared, explains in part why emotions, especially painful
ones, are so central to the world-building aspects of sentimental
alliance.]{.underline}** Postsentimental texts withdraw from the
contract that presumes consent to the conventionally desired outcomes of
identification and empathy[. The desire for unconflictedness might very
well motivate the sacrifice of surprising ideas to the norms of the
world against which this rhetoric is being deployed.]{.underline} What,
if anything, then, can be built from the very different
knowledge/experience of subaltern pain? What can memory do to create
conditions for freedom and justice without reconfirming the terms of
ordinary subordination? More than a critique of feeling as such, **[the
postsentimental modality also challenges what literature and
storytelling have come to stand for in the creation of sentimental
national subjects across an almost two-century span]{.underline}**.
Three moments in this genealogy, which differ as much from each other as
from the credulous citation of Uncle Tom\'s Cabin we saw in The King and
I and Dimples, will mark here some potential within the arsenal that
counters the repetition compulsions of sentimentality. This essay began
with a famous passage from James Baldwin\'s \"Everybody\'s Protest
Novel,\" a much-cited essay about Uncle Tom\'s Cabin that is rarely read
in the strong sense because its powerful language of rageful
truth-telling would shame in advance any desire to make claims for the
tactical efficacy of suffering and mourning in the struggle to transform
the United States into a postracist nation. I cited Baldwin\'s text to
open this piece not to endorse its absolute truth but to figure its
frustrated opposition to the sentimental optimism that equates the
formal achievement of empathy on a mass scale with the general project
of democracy. Baldwin\'s special contribution to what sentimentality can
mean has been lost in the social-problem machinery of mass society, in
which the production of tears where anger or nothing might have been
became more urgent with the coming to cultural dominance of the
Holocaust and trauma as models for having and remembering collective
social experience.20 [Currently, as in traditional sentimentality, the
authenticity of overwhelming pain that can be textually performed and
shared is disseminated as a prophylactic against the reproduction of a
shocking and numbing mass violence]{.underline}. Baldwin asserts that
the overvaluation of such redemptive feeling is precisely a condition of
that violence. Baldwin\'s encounter with Stowe in this essay comes
amidst a general wave of protest novels, social-problem films, and film
noir in the U.S. after World War Two: Gentleman\'s Agreement, The
Postman Always Rings Twice, The Best Years of Our Lives. Films like
these, he says, \"emerge for what they are: a mirror of our confusion,
dis honesty, panic, trapped and immobilized in the sunlit prison of the
American dream.\" [They cut the complexity of human motives and
self-understanding \"down to size\" by preferring \"a lie more palatable
than the truth\" about the social and material effects the liberal
pedagogy of optimism has, or doesn\'t have, on \"man\'s\" capacity to
produce a world of authentic truth, justice, and freedom.]{.underline}21
Indeed, \"truth\" is the keyword for Baldwin. He defines it as \"a
devotion to the human being, his freedom and fulfillment: freedom which
cannot be legislated, fulfillment which cannot be charted.\"22 In
contrast, Stowe\'s totalitarian religiosity, her insistence that sub
jects \"bargain\" for heavenly redemption with their own physical and
spiritual mortification, merely and violently confirms the fundamental
abjection of all persons, especially the black ones who wear the dark
night of the soul out where all can see it. Additionally, Baldwin argues
that Uncle Tom\'s Cabin instantiates a tradition of locating the destiny
of the nation in a false model of the individual soul, one imagined as
free of ambivalence, aggression, or contradiction. By \"human being\"
Baldwin means to repudiate stock identities as such, arguing that their
stark simplicity confirms the very fantasies and institutions against
which the sentimental is ostensibly being mobilized. This national-
liberal refusal of complexity is what he elsewhere calls \"the price of
the ticket\" for membership in the American dream.23 As the Uncle Tom
films suggest, whites need blacks to \"dance\" for them so that they
might continue disavowing the costs or ghosts of white ness, which
involve religious traditions of self- loathing and cultural traditions
confusing happiness with analgesia. The conventional reading of
\"Everybody\'s Protest Novel\" sees it as a violent rejection of the
sentimental.24 It is associated with the feminine (Little Women), with
hollow and dishonest capacities of feeling, with an aversion to the real
pain that real experience brings. \"Causes, as we know, are notoriously
bloodthirsty,\" he writes.25 **[The politico sentimental novel uses
suffering vampirically to simplify the subject, thereby making the
injunction to empathy safe for the subject]{.underline}**. Of course
there is more to the story. Baldwin bewails the sentimentality of
Richard Wright\'s Native Son because Bigger Thomas is not the
homeopathic Other to Uncle Tom after all, but one of his \"children,\"
the heir to his negative legacy.26 Both Tom and Thomas live in a simple
relation to violence and die knowing only slightly more than they did
before they were sacrificed to a white ideal of the soul\'s simple
purity, its emptiness. This addiction to the formula of redemption
through violent simplification persists with a \"terrible power**[\": it
confirms that U.S. minorities are constituted as Others even to
themselves through attachment to the most hateful, objectified,
cartoon-like versions of their identities, and that the shamed
subcultures of America really are, in some way, fully expressed by the
overpresence of the stereotypical image.]{.underline}**

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Identity

#### Identity Politics Turn -- The use of identity politics forgoes class based analysis which only reifies the powers of capitalism 

**Brown 93** \[Wendy, Prof. Pol Sci @ Berkeley, "Wounded Attachments,"
*Political Theory*, Vol. 21 No. 3 (Aug), p. 393-5\] // ONW

In addition to the formations of identity that may be the complex
effects of disciplinary and liberal modalities of power, [**I want to
suggest one other historical strand relevant to the production** of
politicized identity, this one hewn more specifically to recent
developments in political culture]{.underline}. Although sanguine to
varying degrees about the phenomenon they are describing, many on the
European and North American Left have argued that identity politics
emerges from the demise of class politics consequent to post-Fordism or
pursuant to May 1968. [Without adjudicating the precise relationship
between the breakup of class politics and the proliferation of other
sites of political identification**, I want to refigure this claim by
suggesting that what we have come to call identity politics is partly
dependent on the demise of a critique of capitalism and of bourgeois
cultural and economic values**. In a reading that links the new identity
claims to a certain relegitimation of capitalism, identity politics
concerned with race, sexuality, and gender will appear not as a
supplement to class politics, not as an expansion of Left categories of
oppression and emancipation, not as an enriching complexification of
progressive formulations of power and persons-all of which they also
are-but as tethered to a formulation of justice which, ironically,
reinscribes a bourgeois ideal as its measure]{.underline}. If it is this
ideal that signifies educational and vocational opportunity, upward
mobility, relative protection against arbitrary violence, and reward in
proportion to effort, and if it is this ideal against which many of the
exclusions and privations of people of color, gays and lesbians, and
women are articulated, then the political purchase of contemporary
American identity politics would seem to be achieved in part through a
certain discursive renaturalization of capitalism that can be said to
have marked progressive discourse since the 1970s. What this suggests is
that **[identity politics may be partly configured by a peculiarly
shaped and peculiarly disguised form of resentment-class resentment
without class consciousness or class analysis]{.underline}**. This
resentment is displaced onto discourses of injustice other than class
but, like all resentments, retains the real or imagined holdings of its
reviled subject-in this case, bourgeois male privileges-as objects of
desire. From this perspective[, it would appear that the articulation of
politicized identities through race, gender, and sexuality require,
rather than incidentally produce, a relatively limited identification
through class.]{.underline} They necessarily rather than incidentally
abjure a critique of class power and class norms precisely because the
injuries suffered by these identities are measured by bourgeois **norms
of social acceptance, legal protection, relative material comfort, and
social independence. [The problem is that when not only economic
stratification but other injuries to body and psyche enacted by
capitalism]{.underline}** (alienation, commodification, exploitation,
displacement, disintegration of sustaining, albeit contradictory, social
forms such as families and neighborhoods[) are discursively normalized
and thus depoliticized, other markers of social difference may come to
bear an inordinate weight.]{.underline} Absent an articulation of
capitalism in the political discourse of identity, the marked identity
bears all the weight of the sufferings produced by capitalism in
addition to that bound to the explicitly politicized marking.

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Subject/Object Binary

**[The costs of a politics of recognition that is rooted in naming pain
have been critiqued by recent decolonizing and feminist
scholars]{.underline}** (Hartman, 1997, 2007; Tuck, 2009). In Scenes of
Subjection, Sadiya Hartman (1997) discusses how recognizing the
personhood of slaves enhanced the power of the Southern slaveowning
class. **[Supplicating narratives of former slaves were deployed
effectively by abolitionists, mainly White, well-to-do, Northern women,
to generate portraits of abuse that ergo recognize slaves as
human]{.underline}** (Hartman, 2007). In response, new laws afforded
minimal standards of existence, "making personhood coterminous with
injury" (Hartman, 1997, p. 93), while simultaneously authorizing
necessary violence to suppress slave agency. [The slave emerges as a
legal person only when seen as criminal or "a violated body in need of
limited forms of protection]{.underline}" (p. 55). **[Recognition
"humanizes" the slave, but is predicated upon her or his
abjection.]{.underline}** You are in pain, therefore you are. "\[T\]he
recognition of humanity require\[s\] the event of excessive violence,
cruelty beyond the limits of the socially tolerable, in order to
acknowledge and protect the slave's person" (p. 55). [Furthermore,
Hartman describes how slave-as-victim as human accordingly establishes
slave-as-agent as criminal.]{.underline} Applying Hartman's analysis, we
note how the agency of Margaret Garner or Nat Turner can only be viewed
as outsider violence that humane society must reject while
simultaneously upholding the legitimated violence of the state to punish
such outsider violence. [Hartman asks, "**Is it possible that such
recognition effectively forecloses agency as the object of punishment .
. . Or is this limited conferral of humanity merely a reinscription of
subjugation and pained existence?"**]{.underline} (p. 55).

### 1NC -- Case Turn -- Politics of Recognition

#### Intersectionality demands the process of knowing and categorizing which only mimics forms of multiculturalism. 

**Puar 05** \[Jasbir, Associate Professor of Women\'s & Gender Studies

This unknowable monstrosity is not a casual bystander or parasite; [the
nation assimilates this effusive discomfort with the unknowability of
these bodies, thus affectively producing new normativities and
exceptionalisms through the cataloging of unknowables]{.underline}. It
is not, then, that we must engage in the practice Of excavating the
queer terrorist or queering the terrorist; rather, queerness is always
already installed in the project Of naming the terrorist; the terrorist
does not appear as such without the concurrent entrance of perversion,
deviance, deformity. [The strategy of encouraging subjects of study to
appear in all their queernesses, rather than primarily to queer the
subjects of study, provides a subject-driven temporality in tandem with
a method-driven temporality]{.underline}. Playing on this difference,
between the subject being queered versus queerness already existing
within the subject (and thus dissipating the subject as such) allows for
both the temporality of being and the temporality of always becoming. As
there is no entity, no identity to queer, rather queerness coming forth
at us from all directions, screaming its defiance, suggests to me a move
from intersectionality to assemblage[. The Deleuzian assemblage, as a
series Of dispersed but mutually implicated networks, draws together
enunciation and dissolution, causality and effec]{.underline}t. [**As
opposed to an intersectional model of identity, which presumes
components**---race, class, gender, sexuality, nation, age,
religion---**are separable analytics and can be thus disassembled, an
assemblage** is **more attuned to interwoven forces** that merge and
dissipate time, space, and body against linearity, coher- ency, and
permanency.]{.underline} **[Intersectionality demands the knowing,
naming, and thus stabilizing of identity across space and
time,]{.underline}** generating narrarives of progress that deny the
fictive and performative of identification: [you become an identity,
yes, but also timelessness works to consolidate the fiction of a
seamless stable identity in every space.]{.underline} [**As a tool of**
diversity management, and a mantra of liberal **multiculturalism,
intersectionality colludes With the disciplinary apparatus of the
State**]{.underline}---census, demogra- phy, racial profiling,
surveillance---in that \"difference\" is encased within a structural
container that simply wishes the messiness Of identity into a formulaic
grid. Displacing queerness as an identity or modality that is visibly,
audibly, legibly, or tangibly evident, assemblages allow us to attune to
intensities, emotions, energies, affectivities, textures as they inhabit
events, spatiality, and corporealities. [Intersectionality privileges
naming, visuality, epistemology, representation, and meaning, While
assemblage underscores feeling, tactility, ontology, affect, and
information.]{.underline} Most important, given the heightened
death-machine aspect Of nationalism in our contemporary political
terrain---a heightened sensorial and anatomical domination described by
Achille Mbembe as \"necropolitics\"---assemblages work against
narratives Of U.S. exceptionalism that secure empire, challenging the
fixity of racial and sexual taxonomies that inform practices of state
surveillance and control, and befuddling the \"us versus them\" of the
war on terror. **[For while intersectionality and its underpinnings---an
unrelenting epistemological will to truth---presupposes identity and
thus disavows futurity, assemblage, in its debt to ontology and its
espousal of What cannot be known,]{.underline}** seen, or heard, or has
yet to be known, seen, or heard, allows for becoming/s beyond being\'s.

#### Politics of Recognition is bad and leads to ressentiment. 

**Brown 93** \[Wendy, Prof. Pol Sci @ Berkeley, "Wounded Attachments,"
*Political Theory*, Vol. 21 No. 3 (Aug), p. 401-3\]

However, [**it is not only the tension between freedom and equality but
the prior presumption of the self-reliant** and self-made capacities of
liberal subjects, conjoined with their unavowed dependence on and
construction by a variety of social relations and forces, **that makes
all liberal subjects,** and not only markedly disenfranchised ones**,
vulnerable to ressentime**nt]{.underline}: it is their situatedness
within power, their production by power, and liberal discourse\'s denial
of this situatedness and production that casts the liberal subject into
failure, [the failure to make itself in the context of a discourse in
which its self-making is assumed, indeed, is its assumed nature. This
failure,]{.underline} which Nietzsche calls suffering, **[must find
either a reason within itself]{.underline}** (which redoubles the
failure) **[or a site of external blame on which to avenge its hurt and
redistribute its pain]{.underline}**. Here is Nietzsche\'s account of
this moment in the production of ressentiment: For every sufferer
instinctively seeks a cause for his suffering, more exactly, an agent;
still more specifically a guilty agent who is susceptible to
suffering-in short, some living thing upon which he can on some pretext
or other, vent his affects, actually or in effigy\.... **[This \...
constitutes the actual physiological cause of ressentiment, vengeful-
ness, and the like: a desire to deaden pain by means of
affects]{.underline}**. .. to deaden, by means of a more violent emotion
of any kind, a tormenting, secret pain that is becoming unendurable, and
to drive it out of consciousness at least for the moment: for that one
requires an affect, as savage an affect as possible, and, in order to
excite that, any pretext at all.\'8 [**Ressentiment** in this context is
a triple achievement: it **produces an affect**]{.underline} (rage,
righteousness) [**that overwhelms the hurt,** it produces a culprit
responsible for the hurt, and it produces a site of revenge to displace
the hurt]{.underline} (a place to inflict hurt as the sufferer has been
hurt). Together these operations both ameliorate (in Nietzsche\'s terms,
\"anaesthetize\") and externalize what is otherwise \"unendurable.\"
Now, what I want to suggest is that **[in a culture already streaked
with the pathos of ressentiment for these reasons, there are several
characteristics of late modem postindustrial societies that accelerate
and expand the conditions of its production]{.underline}**. My listing
is necessarily highly schematic. First, the phenomenon that William
Connolly names \"**[increased global contingency]{.underline}**\"
combines with the expanding pervasiveness and complexity of domination
by capital and bureaucratic state and social networks to c**[reate an
unparalleled individual powerlessness over the fate and direction of
one\'s own life,]{.underline}** intensifying the experiences of
impotence, dependence, and gratitude inher- ent in liberal capitalist
orders and consitutive of ressentiment.\'9 Second, **[the steady
desacralization of all regions of life-what Weber called disenchant-
ment,]{.underline}** what Nietzsche called the death of God-would appear
to add yet another reversal to Nietzsche\'s genealogy of ressentiment as
perpetually available to \"alternation of direction.\" In Nietzsche\'s
account, the ascetic priest deployed notions of \"guilt, sin,
sinfulness, depravity and damnation\" to \"direct the ressentiment of
the less severely afflicted sternly back upon themselves \... and in
this way \[exploited\] the bad instincts of all sufferers for the
purpose of self-discipline, self-surveillance, and self-overcoming.\"20
However, [the desacralizing tendencies of late modernity undermine the
efficacy of this deployment and turn suffering\'s need for exculpation
back toward a site of external agency. Third, the increased
fragmentation, if not disintegration, of all forms of association until
recently not organized by the commodities market-communities, churches,
families-and the ubiqui- tousness of the classificatory, individuating
schemes of disciplinary society combine to produce an utterly unrelieved
individual, one without insulation from the inevitable failure entailed
in liberalism\'s individualistic construc- tion.]{.underline} In short,
the characteristics of late modern secular society, in which individuals
are buffeted and controlled by global configurations of disciplin- ary
and capitalist power of extraordinary proportions, and are at the same
time nakedly individuated, stripped of reprieve from relentless exposure
and accountability for themselves, together add up to an incitement to
ressenti- ment that might have stunned even the finest philosopher of
its occasions and logics. Starkly accountable, yet dramatically
impotent, the late modem liberal subject quite literally seethes with
ressentiment. [Enter politicized identity, now conceivable in part as
both product of and \"reaction\" to this condition, where \"reaction\"
acquires the meaning that Nietzsche ascribed to it, namely, as an effect
of domination that reiterates impotence, a substitute for action, for
power, for self-affirmation that reinscribes incapacity, powerlessness,
and rejection]{.underline}. For Nietzsche**, [ressentiment itself is
rooted in \"reaction\"-the substitution of]{.underline}** [reasons,
**norms**, and ethics for deeds-and not only moral systems but
identities themselves take their bearings in this reaction]{.underline}.
As Tracy Strong reads this element of Nietzsche\'s thought, Identity
\... does not consist of an active component, but is a reaction to
something outside; action in itself, with its inevitable self-assertive
qualities, must then become something evil, since it is identified with
that against which one is reacting. The will to power of slave morality
must constantly reassert that which gives definition to the slave: the
pain he suffers by being in the world. Hence any attempt to escape that
pain will merely result in the reaffirmation of painful structures.21 If
ressentiment\'s \"cause\" is suffering, its \"creative deed\" is the
reworking of this pain into a negative form of action, the \"imaginary
revenge\" of what Nietzsche terms \"natures denied the true reaction,
that of deeds.\"22 [This revenge is achieved through the imposition of
suffering \"on whatever does not feel wrath and displeasure as he
does]{.underline}\"23 (accomplished especially through the production of
guilt), [through the establishment of suffering as the measure of social
virtue, and through casting strength and good fortune]{.underline}
(\"privilege\" as we say today) [as self-recriminating, as its own
indictment in a culture of suffering: \"it is disgraceful to be
fortunate, there is too much misery.\"]{.underline}24 But in its attempt
to displace its suffering, identity structured by ressenti- ment at the
same time becomes invested in its own subjection. [**This invest- ment
lies not only in its discovery of a site of blame for its hurt will, not
only in its acquisition of recognition through its history of
subjection** (a recogni- tion predicated on injury, now
righteously]{.underline} revalued), but also in the satisfac- tions of
revenge that ceaselessly reenact even as they redistribute the injuries
of marginalization and subordination in a liberal discursive order that
alter- nately denies the very possibility of these things or blames
those who experience them for their own condition. **[Identity politics
structured by ressentiment reverses without subverting this blaming
structure:]{.underline}** it does not subject to critique the sovereign
subject of accountability that liberal indi- vidualism presupposes nor
the economy of inclusion and exclusion that liberal universalism
establishes. [Thus politicized identity that presents itself as a
self-affirmation now appears as the opposite, as predicated on and
requiring its sustained rejection by a \"hostile extemal
world]{.underline}.\"25 Insofar as what Nietzsche calls slave morality
produces identity in reac- tion to power, insofar as identity rooted in
this reaction achieves its moral superiority by reproaching power and
action themselves as evil, identity structured by this ethos becomes
deeply invested in its own impotence, even while it seeks to assuage the
pain of its powerlessness through its vengeful moralizing, through its
wide distribution of suffering, through its reproach of power as such.
[Politicized identity, premised on exclusion and fueled by the
humiliation and suffering imposed by its historically structured impo-
tence in the context of a discourse of sovereign individuals, is as
likely to seek generalized political paralysis, to feast on generalized
political impo- tence, as it is to seek its own or collective
liberation]{.underline}. Indeed it is more likely to punish and
reproach-\"punishment is what revenge calls itself; with a hypocritical
lie it creates a good conscience for itself\'-than to find venues of
self-affirming action.26

#### Disfigurement relies on the fantasy of the whole yet separate body, a fantasy stemming from the anxiety that all bodies can become disabled. The reaction to this anxiety is the exclusion and separation of disability from the self. The alternative is to blow up the binaries of ability and disability and embrace connection as vulnerability, wherein the able body is not to "fall" to disability, but rather we are all built from vulnerability. This requires a radical interrogation of how we represent disability within discourses to work towards a world without "normal."

At the same time, while disability is glamourized as being a socially
useful suffering, all of the anxieties present when confronting
disability are rooted in the realization that the disabled subject is a
castrated subject who has suffered a profound, disempowering loss and,
worse still, this same violence could be done upon anyone. In all of
these texts, characters with disabilities are presented as being
fundamentally crippled by their inability, individuals who are
incomplete and, therefore, perpetually dependent. [The disabled body is
marked]{.underline}, literally and figuratively, [by]{.underline}
terrible [corporeal loss]{.underline} that is so profound [we attempt to
make sense of it through]{.underline} a similarly charged
[anxiety]{.underline}---the loss of the phallus. Although Lacan argues
that the penis is not the phallus but merely symbolic of it, to
represent this loss, disability is inherently tied up in fears of
literal castration, the wholesale loss of sexual potency and the
inability to have penetrative sexual intercourse. Rather than mourning
the loss of physical ability, this anxiety is substituted, with all four
male disabled characters' central animosity being with the loss of their
penis. For this reason, men with physical disabilities are marked as
castrated individuals whose very manhood comes into question as penile
intercourse is determined to be an important signifier of heterosexual
masculinity. Worse still, the anxiety is that to encounter these
castrated men is to risk castration, like a boy apprehending a naked
female for the first time. [The result of]{.underline} this
[anxiety]{.underline} [is a wholesale rejection of the disabled subject
position]{.underline}, [a disavowal that disablement is even a realistic
possibility]{.underline} for the normate subject, and therefore a
distance is generated through fantasies of a shared desire of
segregation. [The desire is to keep the disabled separate]{.underline},
both linguistically and physically, [to prevent the
intermingling]{.underline} of the two groups who must be separated. At
the same time, central to this fantasy is that it is not just the
normate population who crave separation, but the disabled themselves who
are happier when associating with their own kind. Particularly in
Degrassi and Glee, disabled characters are frustrated by the inability
of their normate peers to comprehend and empathize with disability and
find solace only with other disabled characters. In this way, the
disabled are shown as not just preferring but as being better off in
isolation. This fantasy of mutually preferred segregation neutralizes
both the anxiety of proximity between the normate and disabled
population while at the same time assuring the normate that the desire
to isolate the disabled is not selfishly motivated--- segregating the
disabled does not make you a bad person, it is simply what the disabled
prefer. The fundamental problem with these representations is that they
do not present us with the lived experience of disability but rather are
the story of the normate, an anxious subject revolted by their own
vulnerability to the point that they hide from it. In this way, the
stories we tell ourselves in the media are about placating this anxiety,
this terror, and stigmatizing the disabled in the process. The problem
is that the [fantasies of disability that aim to protect the normate
from the perceived threat of]{.underline} castration, [bodily
rupture]{.underline} and death [demand we build]{.underline} not just
[walls]{.underline} around our own narcissistic sense of self but
[around anyone who succumbs to disability]{.underline}. The normate
spends so much time validating their belief that the disabled are
separate that they justify treating the disabled like the Other that
they have cast them to be. The real [danger of the fantasy of
disability]{.underline} is not that it influences the stories we tell
about disability but that these very stories go on to [inform the ways
in which we construct disability within our world]{.underline}. The
[spaces we build, the systems we design, and the programs we
develop]{.underline} are **[all based on fantasies of bodily
supremacy]{.underline}**, not on the reality of vulnerability, and it is
for this reason that our **[efforts are perpetually doomed to
fail]{.underline}**. Julia Kristeva ends her exploration into disability
in Hatred and Forgiveness with a call to [rethink the cultural
construction of disability]{.underline} and, rather than turn away from
disability, to disavow and discriminate against the disabled in profound
ways, [we must embrace vulnerability as being a core experience of
humanity]{.underline}. **[Instead of experiencing disability as
wounding]{.underline}**, Kristeva sees this confrontation as a moment to
[embrace our connection through vulnerability]{.underline}, not the
isolation of our limitations. So [the moment of confrontation becomes a
moment of reflection]{.underline}, with the disabled body reflecting
back to us our own limitations that we have so carefully repressed and,
perhaps, frees us from this internally imposed limit. In this way,
Kristeva sees [hope in disability acting as our analyzer]{.underline}:
[Not]{.underline} necessarily [because 'it could happen to anyone,' but
because it is already in me/us:]{.underline} in [our dreams, our
anxieties, our]{.underline} romantic and existential
[crises]{.underline}, [in this lack of being that invades us when our
resistances crumble]{.underline} and our 'interior castle' cracks.
Because [to recognize it]{.underline} in me [will help]{.underline} me
**[to discover the imparable subject in the limited body]{.underline}**,
to construct a common life project. [A project in which]{.underline} my
[fear]{.underline} of castration, narcissistic injury, defect, and
death, repressed until now, [is transformed into attention,]{.underline}
patience, [and solidarity capable of refining]{.underline} my [being in
the world]{.underline}. In this encounter would the disabled subject
become not my analyst but my analyzer? (Kristeva 2010, 44) Here Kristeva
invites us to not just acknowledge our inherent limitation but to view
our vulnerability as a fundamental truth of our existence. Ultimately,
this is a call to **[blow up the binary of normate/disabled and see
vulnerability as being universal to our experience]{.underline}**. All
of the texts studied here present a [normate subject inherently afraid
of weakness as it threatens the narcissistic identification with the
autonomous]{.underline} and unified [gestalt]{.underline}.
[Disability]{.underline} then [becomes subsumed in this anxiety, seen
through the lens of loss and castration]{.underline}. But this
interrogation is flawed---for the disabled, disability (and its
associated symbols, such as the wheelchair) does not live as the
memorial for what we have lost, but stands as tribute to all that we can
accomplish. As Paul Longmore states, many with disabilities "prize not
self-sufficiency but self-determination, not independence but
interdependence, not functional separateness but personal connection,
not physical autonomy but human community" (Longmore 1995). Those with
disabilities should not be seen as cautionary tales of our vulnerability
but as living evidence that our identities, our very personhood, is so
much stronger than the bodies we inhabit. Our bodies can fracture,
ground against the rocks of time or suffering profound violence, but
this rupture can be endured and, perhaps, survived. Disability is not
proof that we can be broken but evidence that we can survive. Rather
than living in normal bodies that can fall into disrepair, becoming
disabled, [disability is the foundational subject position]{.underline},
[a state of vulnerability upon which we must build ourselves
up]{.underline} rather than anxiously awaiting an impending fall. Rather
than fantasize about life with a disability, there is much that can be
learned from the ways in which those with disabilities live. We must
approach our world with the core belief that we are or will be
disabled--- we are all inherently limited. We need to [let go of our
repressed anxiety about what we cannot achieve and instead strive to
find not just the boundaries of the human but work to find ways to
exceed said limits]{.underline}, together. At the same time,
acknowledging our vulnerability, letting people be vulnerable, is to
demand assistance. Accepting collaboration with others is a necessity,
not a flaw, helps to destigmatize dependency. Interrogating our own
vulnerability means recreating the world not along lines of mandated
normalcy but on the expectation of abnormality. [To live in a world of
vulnerability is to acknowledge that there is no "normal,"]{.underline}
no standard function, and therefore **[we must radically redefine our
interrogation of self and ability]{.underline}**, where deficiencies are
markers of normalcy, not requirement of isolation. It is to live in a
world where dependency is not a mark of pity but a sign of necessary
collaboration, an acknowledgement that there are things we all need help
accomplishing and there are things we can all help others to accomplish.
It is to design our homes as spaces that are not just normatively
functional, but are accessible to a range of individuals. To live in a
world of vulnerability is to reimagine educational spaces to acknowledge
and embrace different learning and examination aptitudes. It is to
develop work environments that strive to augment the limitation of
workers rather than demand labour to conform to production. It is to
reconstitute the laws of our country acknowledging accommodation as a
universal human right, not a privilege. To live in a world of
vulnerability is to explode the generalizations that divide us,
obfuscate us, and minimize us and simply live, together, with limitation
experienced not as shame but an opportunity to innovate.

#### Reconstructing disfigurement re-entrenches violent structures of normativity and results in psychological harm as well as the intensification of classism. Reject reconstruction in favor of spiting normativity and embracing disfigurement.

In the summer of 1990, my tween friends and I invented a game. The rules
were simply this: One girl posed a question, and everyone in the room
had to answer . . . honestly. Our game worked differently from Truth or
Dare, the ubiquitous slumber party game in which adolescents, most often
girls, ask each other revealing personal questions or challenge fellow
players to embarrassing tasks. In our version, players were faced with
telling the "real truth" about another player. These questions had
tricky answers. The game, tinged with all kinds of girlhood sadism,
always ended with someone in tears. Most often that someone was me. Some
questions were fairly benign, such as "Who is the most fun to spend the
night with?" There were moderately hurtful questions, like "If you had
to choose one best friend in the room who would it be?" Of course, you
hoped you were the one, but not every girl could be every other girl's
best friend. So there was a sheepish camaraderie that arose amongst
those of us not picked. But there were also questions that resulted in
the articulation of a clearly delineated hierarchy. Sometimes, one girl
would ask each girl to rank everyone in the room from smartest to
stupidest. I was rarely the smartest, but I was never the stupidest, and
so I don't know what the girl who was crowned "most stupid" really felt
like. I can tell you that she shrugged and laughed and, well, said
something stupid. Being perceived as dumb was (and still is) a viable
role for a girl, and one that you could manage with humor in order to
shake off any stigma that might remain from having failed the second
grade. [Without exception, the game culminated in a question of the
highest stakes: "Rank everybody in this room. 10 is beautiful, and 1 is
ugly." Unlike being dumb, being ugly was simply untenable. During the
1980s and 1990s in my Southern Louisiana, there was no feminist
consciousness around beauty culture. As a girl, I understood very
clearly that any future worth having was contingent on being beautiful.
My childhood dream was twofold. I wished to be very thin and very
blonde. It seemed to me that if these two things were true, then
everything else---a loving family, a beautiful house, a good job,
interesting friends, and invitations to glamorous social events---was
possible. I knew of no other avenue for being happy.]{.underline} Being
asked to rank each girl in the room was a dangerous dare. If you were
too generous, you would be lying. [This was, of course, against the
rules, but if you were honest, you could never take it back. Everyone
would know what you really thought, but perhaps more terrifyingly, you
would know what everyone else thought. I don't know what it felt like to
be told that I was unintelligent, but I do remember what it felt like to
be called ugly---not explicitly, of course, but numbers don't
lie.]{.underline} This was not the first time that the thought had
occurred to me that I might be ugly. As a child, I always had a sense
that my family was exceptionally beautiful. I feared I was not. In
comparison to my blue- eyed, tow-headed blond brothers and my blonde
mother, who was more glamazon than suburban mom, I had dirty blonde
(emphasis on dirty) hair, gapped teeth that were not only crooked but as
an oral surgeon explained later "entirely too small for your head," a
decidedly pointy chin that appeared to me almost witchy, a forehead that
seemed to take up almost half of my face, and gluttonously round cheeks.
In family pictures throughout my childhood, I am often sullen. [Some-
times, though, I'm protesting, sneering at the camera. I discovered that
anger and sarcasm could trump sad. Sneering was a way to avoid crying.
It seemed unfortunate that such beautiful people would have their
picture tainted with my face, but it seemed cruel that I had to take the
picture at all. I imagined that our neighbors upon receiving our
Christmas card remarked, "They're really a beautiful family. It's such a
shame about Heather."]{.underline} When I look at childhood photographs,
what I see is shaped by a vantage point that my ten-year-old self could
never have imagined. I left Louisiana. I pierced my nose. I dyed my
dishwater hair chestnut brown. And I am struck by how not ugly I was. I
was not a beautiful child, but I was not especially unsightly either.
[The truth is that this is where most of us live: in the space between
what is perceived to be attractive and what is designated as ugly.
Regardless of where we find ourselves on the appearance spectrum,
aesthetic intervention contours all of our lives.]{.underline} Beauty
culture---the shared set of language, meanings, norms, and practices
focused on the cultivation of attractiveness---has received inordinate
amounts of scholarly attention in the last thirty years, and for good
reason.1 In anthropologist Michael Taussig's recent examination of body
beautification, he asks: "[Have we not become blind to the force of the
aesthetic, of beauty, if you will, coursing through every- day life?
Surely beauty is as much infrastructure as are highways and bridges,
storytelling and the Internet, rainfall and global warming."2 Not only
have rates of cosmetic surgery exploded, but other methods for
optimizing appearance have proliferated, too. Skin whitening, cosmetic
dentistry, Botox injections alongside other facial fillers, and laser
skin resurfacing are on the rise, rapidly shifting our bodily (and
cultural) infrastructure. **Correspondingly, the desire to be intervened
upon has solidified as a widely shared cultural longing, contingent on
social class and access to resources. Research indicates that most of us
would pursue cosmetic surgery if we were not financially
constrained**]{.underline}.3 Cultural critics have crafted nuanced
accounts describing the ways gender norms, makeover culture, heightened
consumerism, credit availability, and global travel coalesce to make the
production of beautiful bodies not only more accessible, but also more
desirable. The irony, of course, is that cosmetic intervention is
characterized as "elective" surgery. [Studies of beauty culture seem to
suggest the contrary---beauty feels essential or requisite in this day
and age. Yet attractiveness is not the only longing that results in
aesthetic intervention, and cosmetic surgery is only one method of
managing bodily appearance.]{.underline} **[This book is largely about
surgical work that is labeled "reconstructive" and is overwhelmingly
understood as necessary, not elective]{.underline}**. [As opposed to
crafting bodies that more closely approximate cultural ideals,
reconstructive surgery is aimed at repairing those facial features
deemed untenable and even disfiguring. Such surgery is often more
technically complicated, and it typically produces far less glamorous
effects. When we consider so-called necessary reconstructive surgery
alongside elective cosmetic surgery, we can see how appearance writ
large, and not simply beauty, motivates medical interventions.
**Compared to the prevailing appearance ideals, which in the United
States prize whiteness, symmetry, prominent bone structure, and flaw-
less, unblemished skin, I have an unremarkable face. It is not
beautiful, but neither does it bear evidence of congenital difference or
dis- ease or trauma**]{.underline}. Yet I have routinely purchased
astoundingly expensive facial cleanser to ward off adult acne. I have
bleached my teeth in place of regular dental care in the years of gaping
insurance coverage, and I've undergone (and paid for) minor surgeries to
remove embarrassing cysts. I have not done these things to be more
beautiful, but rather so that I remain visually "normal." As someone who
studies aesthetic surgery, I have a mental checklist of what procedures
might produce an attractive effect. [So far I have resisted the lure of
cosmetic surgery, but I have invested financial resources, time, and
energy to manage the other end of the appearance spectrum.]{.underline}
[As a child, the fear that I was ugly was consuming. I am not unique.
Research indicates that girls as young as six identify their appearance
as their most pressing concern.4 Girls dream of being beautiful---but
per- haps equally important, girls fear being ugly. While the intense
desire to be beautiful certainly generates insidious consequences,
anxieties around ugliness can be taxing too. Moreover, race, ethnicity,
and class amplify girls' aesthetic worries. When beauty standards are
racialized and classed, girls who are nonwhite or who do not have access
to basic health care (regularly dentistry, for example) must contend
with the social devaluation of their appearances.5 My own experience
suggests that fearing ugliness is, at core, a fear about the future---as
if a good life is exclusively determined by what we look
like]{.underline}. While I fervently reject such conclusions now, my
sociological imagination suggests that such sensibilities abound, and
not only for growing girls. This anxiety persists into adulthood and
becomes a motivating impetus to monitor and alter one's appearance
throughout life. Bodily features outside the norm from birthmarks to
acne to scars are routinely medically treated, pharmaceutically
medicated, or surgically fixed. So much seems to depend on appearing
normal. [Reconstructive surgeries often facilitate vital physiological
processes such as eating, and in this way, the practice is unlike
cosmetic intervention. Yet the most commonly cited difference between
the specialties is that cosmetic surgery is elective while
reconstructive surgery is needed. The cases described throughout this
book---the surgeries featured on the reality television show Extreme
Makeover, facial feminization surgery marketed to trans women, the
medical mission work of Operation Smile (an international nonprofit),
and facial transplantation (an emerging technology)---are not all
immediately intelligible as forms of reconstructive
surgery]{.underline}. Some cases explored here have been characterized
elsewhere as cosmetic, while others more immediately register as
reconstructive. For example, Extreme Makeover was promoted as
entertainment prominently featuring cosmetic surgery. By contrast, face
transplantation is generally regarded as the most extreme form of facial
reconstructive surgery. Some might contest that these are analogous
cases. Yet these practices share much in common besides a tech- nical
history. While this book describes four very different kinds of
techniques aimed at four distinct patient populations, the explanations
offered for why one would undergo surgery and the benefits promised of
such intervention are remarkably similar across each case. Each
approaches its work as a necessary intervention, signaling that the very
distinction between optimization and repair, cosmetic and
reconstructive, seems to be eroding. [In an increasingly
appearance-focused culture, expectations of attractiveness intensify,
but the significance of reconstructive surgery trans- forms, too. Beauty
is contextually bound and the longing for cosmetic surgery is, in large
part, motivated by cultural imperatives]{.underline}. As a sociologist
would say, cosmetic surgery is socially constructed. What is less
obvious, perhaps, is that the same is true of reconstructive surgery.
Culturally bound appearance norms also structure reconstructive surgery.
What bodies are deemed "in need" is shaped by the very same beauty
cultures that inspire "looking your best"---or, in other words,
optimization. [The appearance spectrum is narrowing as norms are
intensifying. It is not simply that meeting the conventional standards
of beauty is increasingly possible; it is that interventions feel
increasingly necessary. Being attractive is not simply achievable;
rather, it is often expected. This raises a critical question: What are
the consequences of this cultural shift for those faces located at the
devalued end of the appearance spectrum]{.underline}? Might the very
emphasis on attractiveness that resulted in both my own childhood
anxiety and the rampant expansion of beauty culture also produce a
context in which more and more bodies can be labeled "disfigured" and
thus stigmatized? The good life may be contingent on having a beautiful
face. But living itself may be compromised by a face that looms too
close to the devalued end of the appearance spectrum. [This book
demonstrates that conditions not historically under- stood as
antithetical to life---ugliness, for example---are now treated in such
bleak terms. As a result, aesthetic intervention becomes akin to
lifesaving work**.**]{.underline}

#### Attempts to "cure" disfigurement reinforces status quo norms that disabled lives are not worth living. The reductive analysis that differences are purely visible ensures that disfigurement will continue in the status quo.

Such active management provides a much more varied picture than that
painted by popular beliefs about facial variance. As Heather Laine

representations of facial difference, in which it is presented as a type
of social demise: a fate worse than death (2014, 19--20 and 37--42).

contemporary medical practices that set out to fix the faces of
individuals deemed 'disfigured']{.underline} (e.g. extreme makeover
television shows, facial feminization surgery marketed to transwomen,
medical missions to repair cleft lip and palate in developing
countries). [Such 'surgical facial work' is routinely presented as vital
and lifesaving, although it is risky and not always medically
necessary**.**]{.underline} Moreover[**,** it effectively reinstates the
status quo according to which the life of individuals with visible
facial deviance is not worth living]{.underline} **(2014, 38). Indeed,**
[such beliefs inform much of the unwanted attention encountered by the
participants in our study.]{.underline} But, as our findings indicate,
[visible facial difference does not, in fact, form a social death
sentence]{.underline}. Instead, [the visibility experiences of the
participants in our study might more adequately be understood as
instances in which they navigate their social life]{.underline}. [Unlike
the 'disfigurement imagery' would have it, interviewees mostly do not
retreat from the social realm -- either in public or in
private]{.underline}. Instead, **[they manage various others' responses
to their facial difference, thereby negotiating the meaning of visible
difference in social interactions]{.underline}**. In these negotiations,
**[respondents actively position themselves as social actors striving
for and worthy of social recognition.]{.underline}** Social recognition,
as explored in the writings of such prominent philosophers as Charles
Taylor, Axel Honneth, and Nancy Fraser, entails being acknowledged as an
intrinsically worthwhile human being (Fraser and Honneth

such, **[this breach of etiquette is not only an invasion of privacy --
it is also a form of misrecognition]{.underline}**. When visibly
different individuals are denied the same 'civil inattention' typically
accorded to the ordinary-looking, they are effectively treated as if
they are public property instead of sovereign beings. [The ability to be
politely disregarded in public, in other words, comes down to being
implicitly recognized as a social actor deserving of equal treatment and
respect.]{.underline} Accordingly, stigma is a threat to a person's
social 'face' exactly because it undermines the stigmatized person's
fundamental right to be treated equally and respectfully by others[.
This means that our participants' negotiations of their in/visibility in
encounters with others in fact form micro-level 'struggles for
recognition'.]{.underline}

#### Societal impositions of value of particular aspects of the human body result in violence against disfigured folks -- we must holistically orient ourselves against notions of reconstruction to rectify the violent expectations that society's normativity imposes.

On November 27, 2005, a team of French surgeons, led by Jean-Michel
Dubernard and Bernard Devauchelle, performed the world's first par- tial
face transplant in Amiens, France. Face transplantation (FT) is an
experimental procedure in which a face is surgically removed from a
donor and replanted on a recipient's head for the treatment of facial
disfigurement, resulting from congenital conditions or trauma. [News
coverage alleged that the recipient's dog had chewed off her lips, chin,
and nose in an effort to rouse her after a suicide attempt.1 Initial
stories announcing the transplant were followed with reports that the
recipient's results were so good that she had regained enough facial
functioning to resume smoking. This news was met with derision from
other surgeons, who suggested that the French team's choice of patient
was less than ideal.2 The French surgical team had previously
transplanted a hand and forearm to a New Zealand man who had lost his
own in a chainsaw accident while serving time in prison. News accounts
criticized the team's patient selection protocol, implying that such
innovative techniques should be reserved for a nonsmoker or a
nonincarcerated person---in other words, someone "more deserving" or
perhaps less culpable.]{.underline} On April 14, 2006, reports confirmed
that a Chinese surgical team working at Xijing Hospital completed the
world's second partial face transplant.4 Two years prior a black bear
had attacked this recipient, leaving open wounds and visible pink flesh
in the place of a recogniz- able face. Press releases following the
surgery displayed a man's face, albeit swollen and stitched, but
relatively intact. In January 2007, Lau- rent Lantieri completed a third
face transplant at another Paris hospital. This time the experimental
procedure was used as a last-ditch interven- tion to treat
neurofibromatosis, a condition that causes the growth of tumors on the
face. This is the same condition Joseph Merrick, whose fictionalized
life story is depicted in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man (1980), is
thought to have experienced. The story of a man with a congenital
condition is arguably less melodramatic than stories of "ani- mals on
the attack," but spectacular in its own right given the rarity and
severity of the condition. In the United States, advancement of the
technology is dispersed across the country with different teams
completing essential research and experimentation. Beginning in 1995, a
research team based in the Plastic Surgery Department at the University
of Louisville commenced extensive research establishing the critical
technical, immunological, and ethical groundwork necessary to complete
the procedure. Plastic surgeon Marie Siemionow from the Cleveland Clinic
declared in 2005 (even before the first face transplant in France) to
Katie Couric on NBC's The Today Show that she was in the process of
identifying her first patient. Following Siemionow's appearance,
periodic media outlets "announced" the Cleveland Clinic's intention to
complete the first American transplant, and in 2008, Siemionow declared
the United States' first FT a success.5 Siemionow's patient later
revealed her face on the Oprah Winfrey Show and told her story of being
shot in the face by her husband. On April 9, 2009, Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston followed with a partial transplant on a man whose
injuries were acquired in an unusual accident in which he fell on the
electrical tracks of the Boston subway. To date, additional transplants
have been completed in the United States, Spain, and Turkey, but the
procedure remains experimental, as surgical teams assess the capacity of
FT to treat a range of facial conditions and innovate techniques for
successful surgical outcomes. The details of the recent transplants and
the emerging science of FT make it an astounding development in
aesthetic surgery. Not surpris- ingly, then, fantastic images pervade
pop culture accounts. Some media accounts rely on fantasies fed by
celebrity culture, as the first sentence of one news story about FT
illustrates: "Have you ever wished that you had the good looks of Halle
Berry or Ashton Kutcher or the hottest student in school?"6 Similarly,
the final page of a 2005 issue of People magazine contained a feature
titled, "If you had to have a face transplant which famous face would
you want?" Hollywood actresses responded with names of other starlets.
[These stories couch the technology in a celeb- rity aesthetic, with its
emphasis on glamour and consumption. FT is treated as the newest, most
innovative, albeit still in-development inter- vention that promises to
make bodies beautiful. While those directly involved in developing the
technology repeatedly rebuff the idea that FT will ever function as a
cosmetic procedure, the story persists.7 Other media accounts make
reference to science fiction themes of wonder- ment or futuristic
horror. Several recent newspaper articles reference the 1997 Hollywood
action thriller Face/Off, in which a main charac- ter receives a face
transplant in order to thwart a terrorist attack, and a 2005 episode of
Nip/Tuck in which a botched face transplant results in rejection of the
transplanted face, which has to then be removed.8]{.underline} At the
same time that FT is sensationalized, it is also celebrated as
scientifically noteworthy. Dr. L. Scott Levin, chief of plastic and
recon- structive surgery at Duke University Medical Center, has
described the procedure as "the single most important area of
reconstructive research."9 Yet it is unclear what the future holds for
FT. Experimenta- tion may morph into a viable treatment option offered
as standard of care, or FT may vanish from the scene entirely due to
failure or ethical issues. FT is positioned strategically by proponents
as a revolutionary intervention and by critics as too risky, and as such
its ultimate trajec- tory is unknown---and thus deeply interesting
analytically. As I write, the story of FT continues to unfold. FT builds
upon knowledge and skills from numerous scientific spe- cialties
including reconstructive surgery, transplantation surgery, and
immunology. Simply put, FT emerged to improve upon traditional
reconstructive methods. For faces with what is often called "severe
facial disfigurement," reconstructive techniques such as free tissue
transfer, which involves the relocation of tissue from one part of the
body to another, are notoriously ineffective. These techniques require
surger- ies throughout the course of a lifetime, sometimes numbering
into the hundreds, and the end results of reconstructive techniques
offer mod- est results. For example, a face that has been severely
burned is often repaired through a series of skin grafts. While this
technique can facili- tate some improvement in facial function and
minimize the appearance of scarring, it can result in a face that
resembles a conglomeration of skin grafts of varying colors and
textures. In the case of injury, critical tissue like a nose may be
missing or components of the face may be damaged beyond repair, making
reconstruction particularly difficult to accomplish. Thus, FT was
crafted to address the limitations of estab- lished reconstructive
techniques and, ultimately, to produce better results with fewer
surgeries. Technically, FT is most akin to facial replantation in which
a per- son's own facial tissue is reattached after trauma. The first
case of facial replantation took place in India after a nine-year-old
girl's face and scalp were torn off when a grass-cutting machine caught
one of her braids. Her family packed the tissue on ice and traveled to
the near- est hospital. After ten hours of microsurgery, the girl's face
was reat- tached. The case made reconstructive surgery history, and
opened up the possibility for the transplantation of a face from a donor
to a recipi- ent.10 While replantation offers better results than other
reconstructive techniques, it is only available in cases in which facial
tissue remains in good condition. Thus, many kinds of trauma and
congenital differences are not treatable through replantation. FT also
shares technical, ethical, and social histories with transplant
medicine, specifically hand transplantation. In 1998, a French team also
led by Jean-Michel Dubernard completed the world's first hand
transplant, though credit for the world's first successful hand
transplant belongs to a research team at the University of Louisville.
In the French case, the transplanted tissue was eventually removed after
the patient stopped following his immunosuppression regimen. Many
experts understand hand transplantation and FT as analogous procedures.
Both types of transplant are composite tissue allotransplants involving
a number of tissues including muscle, nerves, blood vessels, arteries,
veins, and skin.11 **[Yet critics like bioethicist Francoise Baylis
contend that "a face may be like a hand from the perspective of a
surgeon interested in the technical problem of repair," but there are
"morally significant differences."12 As Baylis argues, that idea that
the hand is just like a face only works as a technical analogy because
in the event of rejection or failure, the stakes are appreciably
different. A hand can be replaced with a prosthetic. A face cannot.13
Analogizing face and hand transplantation highlights the technical
similarities of the body matter, but the juxtapo- sition also points to
the divergent meanings and significance accrued to each body
part.]{.underline}** The history of sustained ethical debate in relation
to transplant medicine is reflected in the story of FT, in that
transplant protocols consistently raise unique and divisive questions.
Because FT involves the transplant of a donor organ from a dead body
onto a living recipi- ent, FT relies on surgical research and the work
of immunology. Like all kinds of transplantation, FT requires that
recipients begin a life- long regimen of immunosuppressive drugs in
order to prevent rejec- tion of the transplanted tissue. Debates about
FT largely hinge on this fact---immunosuppressive drugs are toxic.14 FT
relies on the technolo- gies of transplant medicine but also activates
ongoing conversations within the field of transplantation specifically,
and biomedicine more broadly.15 With the advent of heart
transplantation, bioethicists, medi- cal professionals, and the public
were forced to reconsider what con- stitutes life and death. For
example, transplantation depends on the designation of brain death. When
particular criteria are met, organs can be harvested for transplantation
from the organ donor to the recipient. Undoubtedly, the emergence of a
new death status, namely brain death, made lifesaving intervention
possible. As such, the history of transplantation demonstrates that
before innovations can become integrated into routine medical care, new
ways of thinking about organic processes and human experience must
emerge. Perhaps most significantly, our ways of thinking about what
counts as death can evolve in relation to an intervention that promises
to save lives. [Thus within the field of transplantation, there is a
well-established pattern of debate around unprecedented and complex
bioethical questions. FT calls into question how we balance the benefits
of intervention---in this case a new face---with physiological,
psychological, and social risks. When identity crisis, public distrust,
chronic illness, and even death are potential risks of intervention, the
benefits must be significant in order to proceed.]{.underline} [The
previous three chapters illustrate that **one significant conse- quence
of the disfigurement imaginary is that those labeled disfigured are
positioned as socially dead. As my analysis of Extreme Makeover
illustrates, characterizing faces as disfigured amplifies stigmatization
such that appearance gets positioned as undermining critical facets of
human life. Facial feminization surgery employs the disfigurement
imaginary to characterize a particular aesthetic as fundamentally
threatening to social interaction. Operation Smile routinely suggests
that a universal dimension of human experience is undermined by facial
difference**. By framing the consequences of appearance in such stark
terms, facial work becomes imbued with profound lifesaving significance.
To be sure, the specter of social death inspires FT, and many of the
primary benefits of FT are similar to those described in other sites.
Yet the actual practices of facial transplantation also stand in stark
contrast to the facial work described in the previous three chapters. FT
is technically more complicated than the repair of a cleft palate, for
example, and it is less routinized than the methods used on Extreme
Makeover or in facial feminization surgery (FFS). Addition- ally, those
potentially subject to FT experience the kinds of facial dif- ference
that result in the most profound social exclusion. Perhaps the most
important difference is that FT raises unique questions about the
benefits of aesthetic intervention in relation to other dimensions of
bodily well-being. For FT to proceed, the costs of disfigurement must be
weighed against the risks of compromised health---or even bodily
death.]{.underline} Ultimately FT illustrates the way the disfigurement
imaginary not only structures the meanings associated with facial
difference, but rather fundamentally shapes clinical practice. Each site
of facial work demonstrates that when disfigurement is understood as
socially deadly, facial work takes on lifesaving significance and moral
authority. FT suggests something else altogether: that in the case of
facial difference, bodily death might be increasingly understood as a
reasonable risk for warding off particular kinds of social death. The
work of innovating technologies is more mundane than spectacu- lar
science news coverage suggests. Often, the development of medical
practices occurs within research universities, and as such the emphasis
on respectability, protocol, and institutional politics (not to mention
neoliberal profit-seeking) abounds. In the case of FT specifically and
in most innovative procedures generally, what appears to be revolu-
tionary science is built on a foundation of mundane scientific tinker-
ing through routine practices like animal experimentation, intellectual
labor through the development of bioethics protocols, and political
maneuvering through institutional checks and balances, namely insti-
tutional review boards (IRBs). Understanding face transplantation out-
side of the sensationalized accounts offered in media required entering
the sites in which face transplantation takes shape as a concrete
medical intervention with real-life consequences. To this end, I
conducted field- work at meetings of a US-based face transplant team and
interviews with key team members to critically analyze how the work of
techno- logical innovation came to rest on the meanings of facial
disfigurement. The face transplant team I studied met at a 7 a.m. Monday
morning meeting each week for almost three years. The meetings were held
in a commonplace conference room in an ordinary building with an unre-
markable name: Hospital Building One.16 At the meetings I observed,
those who attended varied, but four key members of the face transplant
team emerged. A leading plastic surgery researcher, whose career thus
far had been spent innovating a range of reconstructive techniques
including hand transplantation, led the team. A philosopher served as
the team's bioethicist, while a sociologist and a psychologist offered
insights about the social psychological facets of FT. The team was also
comprised of medical students along with additional clinicians and
researchers, but these four comprised the hub around which the team's
work was organized and carried out. While the topic of the meetings
might have been spectacular, the actual meetings were much like other
research collaborations in which I participated in the context of
university life. From the time I first attended a meeting in May 2006
until the team disbanded in July 2007, its work was focused almost
entirely on disseminating research results and articulating an ethical
approach to FT. The face transplant team's relationship with its
institution, specifically hospital administration, is critically
important for understanding the work of the team. Although the team had
established scientific understandings and technical skills needed to
complete a transplant, the institution had rejected requests from the
team to serve as a site for human experimentation. There was to be no
face transplant at the team's home institution, nor were any team
members to participate in any transplant anywhere else in the world. In
a strange way, then, the team's immediate goal was not to complete a
face transplant; rather the central task was rhetorical---pro- fessional
and lay publics needing convincing that FT could and in fact should
proceed. The work of the team took two related forms: collectively
develop- ing institutional and public arguments based on the team's
research and collaboratively completing the mundane tasks of scholarly
research, specifically writing articles for publication in peer-reviewed
journals. As my fieldnotes demonstrate, the meetings of the FT team
resembled other sites of academic research: As is typical, the director
opens up his notebook, a bound journal, to review his notes on the
manuscripts in process. One by one he goes through the team's writing
projects. The team talks details. Who is writing what? Where are they
sending it? Who is its intended audience? Can the stats be made more
intelligible? But in the midst of these details, the team discusses why
the team is writing the pieces they are writing. What pur- pose does
each serve? The goal is clear---the team is establishing ethical
arguments and extending knowledge for the purpose of facilitating FT.17
At any one time, the team worked on multiple scientific articles. Sev-
eral were focused on putting medical specialties in conversation with
one another. For example, the team submitted an overview of FT to a
general plastic surgery journal with the aim of introducing the immu-
nological information to professionals with the technical skills to com-
plete face transplants. Other articles directly addressed the ethical
ques- tions raised by FT.

#### To invest into logics of reconstructing disfigurement is to acknowledge the socially deadened position of disfigured people as well as people who are deemed as having non-vital disabilities when it comes to reconstruction -- the impacts are social alienation, psychological violence, and authenticity testing.

[A psychologist named Frances Cooke Macgregor . . . wr\[ote\] about dis-
figurement. She had a concept called "social death." She got me to
think- ing about how we've come up with different definitions of age.
Age just doesn't mean chronological years anymore. Now we have an
emotional age, a maturation age, a middle age. I started thinking
similarly along the lines of death. We can have different kinds of
death. We have the death that everybody grieves. We also have brain
death. Why can't we have social death? . . . The stigma facing these
folks, perhaps, is the strongest that still exists. It seems to be
universal . . . It is the most damaging social disability that still
exists . . . Reconstructive surgery does not bring them back to life.
Face transplantation can do that. This account is striking for three
reasons. First, it reveals a working understanding of social death.
Secondly, it explicitly positions facial disfigurement as like death,
and finally, FT is described as a kind of life- saving intervention.
This team member also articulates an intellectu- ally nuanced and deeply
empathetic understanding of the real costs of ableism. In the context of
bioethical research about emerging forms of facial work, it makes sense
that social death would be invoked as short- hand for stigma. Yet this
way of understanding the relationship between social death and facial
disfigurement operates in sharp contrast with the central analysis of
this book, which critically unpacks "social death" as a discursive
formation with embodied consequences.]{.underline} Similarly, the team
psychologist, in an effort to characterize the importance of FT,
analogized disfigurement to cancer: The face is a primary organ of
communication . . . Clearly, it doesn't entail the same level emergency
or immediacy as medication to cause someone to recover from an ongoing
stroke or heart attack, nor is it a cure for cancer. But facial
disfigurements are a form of social cancer given that it's constantly
intruding in your social relationships. Though this explanation somehow
positions disfigurement as not as "immediate" as other bodily
conditions, it nonetheless relies on a link between disfigurement and
death. Taken together, the interviews with team members captured a
shared way of thinking and, by extension, talking about facial
disfigurement. Given that institutional rules prohibited the team from
complet- ing a FT, the rhetorical nature of the work they initiated is
critically important to consider. The team routinely employed the
disfigurement imaginary, and in effect they positioned facial difference
as socially deadly. Because the disfigurement imaginary persists in
various arenas of social life, it is not surprising to see those engaged
in facial work reflect shared cultural notions about facial difference.
In employing such perceptions of facial difference, surgeons and other
profession- als certainly reified the imaginary. But perhaps more
importantly, positioning disfigurement as deadly lends a particular
significance to intervention. Implicitly, aesthetic intervention is
understood as a vital intervention. But what effects do these emergent
meanings have? How does the disfigurement imaginary initiate a new,
decidedly vital form of aesthetic intervention, and more specifically in
relation to FT, how does the implicit diagnosis of social death make way
for exposing patients to unique risks? Just as transplant technology
demanded a new way of understand- ing death and the invention of brain
death facilitated the development of organ transplantation, FT is a case
that explicitly demonstrates how positioning the lens of social death
directly affects clinical practice. The preceding analysis reveals the
routine interpretive work of one trans- plant team as they employed the
disfigurement imaginary, but the ques- tion remains: How has the
disfigurement imaginary infused the larger debate and the actual
practice of FT? Importantly, the disfigurement imaginary transcended the
collective understandings of this transplant team, and is, in fact,
reflected in the ongoing deliberations in biomedi- cine. In moving the
analysis toward a space where disciplinary consen- sus is sought, we can
identify potential effects of such ways of thinking. Specifically, we
can consider how the emergent associations between death and appearance
extend beyond the idiosyncratic, representing a new way of approaching
human appearance writ large. Contested Risks and Benefits of Face
Transplantation In 2004, the American Journal of Bioethics, arguably the
leading bio- ethics journal in the world, featured a series focused on
the ethics of FT. The commentary, published before any surgical team
attempted to complete a face transplant, was structured as a forum in
which to consider the issue prior to clinical experimentation. According
to the journal's website, "the mission of The American Journal of
Bioethics and bioethics.net \[AJOB's complementary website\] is to
provide the clinical, legal, academic, scientific, religious and broad
community-at-large with a rapid but comprehensive debate of issues in
bioethics."18 The debate was spurred by a target article, a piece that
focuses on a single issue. In this case, the article, "On the Ethics of
Facial Transplantation Research," written by a team at the University of
Louisville and first-authored by bioethicist Osbourne Wiggins, argues
that the ethical criteria devel- oped for innovative transplant surgery
had been satisfied and that it was time to pursue clinical
experimentation.19 An open commentary, a series of pieces written by
scholars in response to the target article, fol- lowed. The entire
debate consists of fifteen articles.20 It is important to note that the
second response, entitled "A Surgeon's Perspective on the Ethics of Face
Transplantation," is coauthored by the French surgeons who, within the
year following publication, completed the world's first partial face
transplant. The AJOB website describes the commentary as "a
conversation" about pressing bioethical issues.21 But as bioethicist Tod
Chambers suggested, the exchange was more than a conversation: "They
\[Wiggins et al.\] view the publication of their essay in AJOB as an
important illocutionary speech act that will permit them to begin per-
forming the surgery."22 Thus, hope of actually performing a transplant
infuses the debate. The AJOB commentaries represent a unique moment in
the devel- opment of a technological innovation. While animal trials,
testing of antirejection medication, and cadaver experimentation were
success- fully completed, in lieu of human experimentation the
University of Louisville face transplant team initiated a conversation
with transplant surgeons, bioethicists, philosophers, immunologists, and
psychologists to debate "the issues," a strategy that preeminent
bioethicist Arthur Caplan described as "prophylactic ethics."23 In other
words, the conver- sation was an attempt to demonstrate sincere ethical
deliberation to cir- cumvent public outrage and intraprofessional
conflict that proponents worried would follow human experimentation. The
Wiggins et al. tar- get article came at a particularly contentious
moment. In 2003, a Work- ing Party of the Royal College of Surgeons of
England, an independent body of surgeons, refused to endorse
experimental FT, arguing that the requirements for ethical practice had
yet to be met.24 [As a key site of ethical deliberation, the American
Journal of Bio- ethics issue can be analyzed as a cultural space wherein
questions and critiques about FT are articulated and the terms of
contestation come into formation. In this way, the AJOB special issue on
FT is a source of data about the making of a new technology,
specifically how the mean- ings attributed to bodies, bodily difference,
and interventions are con- tested in the process of establishing a
working framework for clinical practice. The contours of the AJOB debate
illustrate the ways in which ideas about the face, and more specifically
facial difference, are strategi- cally deployed in an effort to shape
the future of facial work. I position the journal issue as an object of
sociological analysis in order to con- sider how the disfigurement
imaginary operated throughout and how notions of social death were
discussed alongside bodily death. Specifi- cally, I analyzed the debate
with two seemingly self-evident questions in mind: First, what risks
associated with FT dominate the debate? Second, what unique benefits are
attributed to FT? In articulating their stance on FT, contributors not
only answer these simple questions but also reveal working assumptions
about what kind of life is possible with facial difference and what an
unremarkable face is worth]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Link - Trans Monstrosity

#### The trans body ruptures categories and the very logic of body normativity as a form of corporeal resistance. The true breakthroughs in repression of trans people and trans identity is through legible monstrosity -- it makes no sense but you can sense its presence.

As we all are, I am becoming---never actually occurring, but "always
forthcoming and already past" (Deleuze, 1990, p. 80). My movement is not
a journeying from one static state to another. It is a state of constant
movement. An articulating of movements rather than a sequence of
moments. [I am mov- ing in multiple directions at once. My body is
becoming what we call more "masculine" than it was before, even as I am
becoming what we call more "feminine" than I am now. I am becoming more
masculine in shape and yet, more femi- nine in movement. I find myself
embodying a certain femininity that I did not feel comfortable in, in
movements before, when my body looked more female. Though my voice now
is in male-octaves, I am speaking more softly than I did. This is a
masculine-bodied femininity. It is how my new movement is expressing
itself in this new shaping I am taking.]{.underline} And, as I am
"always forthcoming and already past," this gendered expression is both
new movement and remnant of itself, which has and will continue to
change. **[I am becoming more and less recognizable, in different ways,
simultaneously. My body ruptures categories and threatens ideas of body
normativity, renouncing "beauty" to be "beast," while breaking the
binary meaning of beauty and beast by being monstrously beautiful. This
is a corporeal resistance. It is both intentional and unintentional.
This "monstering" brings me freedom and joy, yet also danger and fear.
Being "monstered"---being made into a monster through others' eyes---can
hurt.]{.underline}** Like Susan Stryker, I relate to Frankenstein's
monster. Stryker (1994) says, I find a deep affinity between myself as a
transsexual woman and the monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
**[Like the monster, I am too often perceived as less than fully human
due to the means of my embodiment; like the monster's as well, my
exclusion from human community fuels a deep and abiding rage in me that
I, like the monster, direct against the conditions in which I must
struggle to exist]{.underline}**. (p. 238) [Though I am not a
transsexual woman, but a transsexual male-ish being, I see myself
reflected in this experience. As the descriptor "monstrosity" sticks
differently to different monstered bodies, I wonder whether it is right
to liken my particular, White transmasculine experiences---which afford
me certain privileges---to transfeminine experiences, to experiences of
trans people of color, or to those of any other Others, for that
matter]{.underline}. While privilege is important to account for, it is
also true that I too feel excluded from human community---the human
community that grows between what we imagine as "Western," White,
able-bod- ied, cisgender, male, heteronormative, economically advantaged
bodies. I too feel indignity and rage at my exclusion, and the effects
of social trauma. As I conduct research interviews, I find connection
and resonance listening to other trans people's stories. Sam tells me
about how in his Japanese American family, there is a culture of
silence. They do not talk about the internment of World War II. He tells
me about the loud silence, the guilt, and obligation. Trauma gets
regenerated in the next genera- tion, but those in the next generation
do not know where it is coming from or why they are traumatized. His
family's silence feels isolating. Their distancing and misrecognition of
his gender almost feels normal to Sam, who is used to silence and
isolation. I listen, relating to his stories. The knowledge of Judaism
has been lost over generations in my family. I have not learned much
about my Jewishness or about the trauma I have inherited. But the
silence is there. The guilt is there. The anxiety is there. War
traumatized me too. My grandfather fought as a soldier in World War II.
My ancestors lived with fear in the midst of genocide, and the next
generations inherited their guilt about surviving. This trauma is ever
present. I do not know the story. But I can feel it. I feel it in my
isolation from my family. In my isola- tion from myself, and in the
persistent fear that I've done something wrong or that I do not deserve
intimacy. This makes my isolation as a transsexual more vivid. Hearing
Sam's story, I better understand and reclaim my lost past. Connecting
with him helps me connect to myself. And put my fragmented self back
together. **[How can this isolation, this pain, this rage engender pro-
ductive possibilities for resistance? How can we find free- dom in and
through the monsters in ourselves? What freedom can this be?
Frankenstein's monster resists dehumanization by learning to speak,
enacting subjectivity and claiming himself as a subject. He makes
himself legi- ble by speaking about his experience of exclusion. "Like
that creature," Stryker (1994) says, "I assert my worth as a monster in
spite of the conditions my monstrosity requires me to face, and redefine
a life worth living" (p. 250). We shape-shifters are making ourselves
legible by speaking our truths. We are rejecting subjugation. We are
invoking and claiming abject positions---femininities and queer gen-
derednesses---as a form of resistance. We resist dehuman- ization by
making ourselves, our pain, and our complex lives legible. We talk
back]{.underline}**. But, I wonder about the limits of language. I
wonder about the limits of recognition as a strategy for liberation. And
I wonder: Is it right to put the onus on us? We are not the only ones
injured by our oppression. People suffer from their separation from us,
from coercing each other into enacting harm, and in feeling remorse from
that harm. We all suffer from this separation from each other.
Oppression is a form of collective trauma. It is inside all of us. We
are not singular entities separate from each other---we all have
multiple selves, and we all form a collective body. Oppression separates
us all from parts of ourselves as well as from each other. And we need
to work together with our- selves and each other to transform it. [What
is monstrous? Who is a monster, and to whom? "Monstrous" seems to mean
terrifying otherness---"Other" by definition, a definitional
inferiorization. However, the capacity to evoke terror is a certain kind
of power. I seek to claim that power through claiming monstrousness in
myself. The word "monster" derives from verbs: "the Latin 'monere,' to
warn, and 'demonstrare,' to show or make visible" (Botting, 1991, p.
142). "'Daemon'"---a term Shelley uses to describe the monster---"is the
Latinate transliteration of the Greek daimon, \[meaning\] eros, or love"
(Wittman, 1998, p. 89). And as Deleuze and Guattari (1987) observe, "It
is not the slumber of reason that engenders monsters, but a vigilant and
insomniac rationality"]{.underline} (cited in Botting, 1991, p. 161). I
thus use this term in an oppositional way, by return- ing it to its
roots, and returning myself to mine in the pro- cess. I "monster," or
make visible the dehumanization I have faced, which is a result of
dominant, rational ways of think- ing---what individuals deploy to
render me "monstrous." I take power in exhibiting others' terrorizing
behavior. Perhaps surprisingly, love has a part in shaping our stories
of mon- stering and of being made into monsters. It is 5 years ago, a
time before I began testosterone treat- ment. My age is 27. My queer
gender appears indiscernible to many people.4 It is a "'discreditable
identity' that must be confirmed, repeatedly through discourse and
action" (Foucault, 1978; Goffman, 1963; Yoshino, 2006; as cited in
Adams, 2011, p. 88). This is true of many identities. In particular,
indigenous identities, like trans identities, are imagined in many
contexts as mythological or as not "really" existing. However, being
disavowed fundamen- tally defines trans experience. The hegemony of
biological essentialism means that, for example, the existence of cis-
gender individuals is taken for granted. [Their identities are not
questioned---they are assumed to exist. Trans people, in contrast, are
assumed to not exist; they are assumed to "actually" be something
else---something that can be known by viewing their bodies. Biological
essentialism thus discredits trans identity. Trans people must therefore
continually re-assert their identities. As a trans person, I occupy a
particularly between kind of betweenness. Among my other legible
positionalities, I am read as sexually deviant because I appear
gender-devi- ant. In this historical movement, I enjoy pushing people to
think about gender in a nonbinary way.]{.underline} On the bus, I sit,
on my way to work. I look out the win- dow, thinking about the children
I will see soon. In the next moment, I feel energy reaching out to me. I
sense eyes follow- ing me. I am being watched---realization dawns in an
instant. Glancing up, I confront eyes querying me. Eyes wonder- ing. Boy
or girl? Man or woman? This is beyond curiosity. It is desire. It is the
wanting to possess, the intention to extract, it is the mission to
obtain for oneself information---no: Truth. I feel a sense of amusement
watching the eyes' confu- sion, their concentration. I enjoy the chaos
my body prompts. These eyes feel and imagine themselves to be legitimate
knowers. How dare I, as Other, challenge their abilities to "know"?
[**My very ambiguity challenges their understanding of themselves as
omniscient. My ambiguity moves into their space, cornering their minds.
They do not know which way to turn. My androgyny fucks with their
imagined able-bodiedness: I impair their ability to catego- rize me**. I
challenge their conceptions of gender; I shake the foundations of their
narrative. I upheave their ideas of Truth and their trusty methods to
know it. I am successfully undo- ing gender (Butler, 2004) by being
illegible. I am living the unlivable. Their failure to attribute a
gender category to me makes my ambiguous gender performance a form of
resis- tance. I take power in their confusion. I feel a rush of heat and
euphoria in this moment of freedom---**as I monster, gender-fuck and
gender-terrorize**.]{.underline}

#### Intrinsic to the social location of being trans is a monstrosity of presentation and behavior. To be stealth vs out, to present masc, femme, or gender non-comforming is not only a direct action against cis-ness but transgresses on societal expectations to the point of constituting monstrosity.

[It is an unusually warm Tuesday morning in March. This is the first
semester I am teaching my own class. I am 31 years old, but I appear to
be 20. As I am young-looking, I wear a costume to make my class believe
I am the instructor: professional khaki pants, dress shoes, a button-up
shirt, an argyle sweater, and a tie. For the first 2 weeks of the
semester, I am so nervous to perform "instructor" that I do not sleep
the night before I teach.]{.underline} For today's class, we have read
an article on trans people's experiences in workplaces. I have some
personal experience I could share regarding this topic, as the class-
room is my workplace and I am trans. I explain the differences between
"MTF" ("male to female") and "FTM" ("female to male") and several other
common transgender identities. My 35 students sit, intrigued expressions
on their faces. I explain: "Someone who transitions from male to female
is a trans woman, and trans women usually use the pronoun 'she.'" Out of
my earshot, a student retorts, "How can you call that a woman?"
Oblivious to this comment, I continue. I face the board, and write the
words "stealth" and "out." I turn to face the students. ["What does this
term, 'stealth' mean?" I ask, pointing to the word. A student raises her
hand. "When a trans person does not tell people they are trans," she
states. "Good," I say. Standing there, I am performing "stealth." My
students are not aware of my transness. I have not come out to them. I
hesitate, considering telling them I am performing stealth as we speak,
to demonstrate the concept. I would "out" myself in that speech act, and
I would no longer be stealth. I feel lucid. It seems a perfect time to
come out, since we are discussing the terms, but I do not feel at ease
with the idea of them knowing this about me. It has been only months
since my gender ambiguity has become less visible, and it has been a
relief to receive fewer otherizing looks and comments in that time. But
I am still hypervigilant about how I am being read. I decide to just go
on with the lesson without mentioning my personal connection to the
material. I write the word "passing" on the board. I say: "'Passing' is
when a person 'passes' as 'not trans,' intentionally does not come out
as 'trans.' The term 'passing' is problematic though. Can you imagine
why?" A student offers, "It assumes that a person is not 'really' who
they are," I reply, "Exactly. This concept can invalidate trans people.
The term 'stealth' also suggests deception, which supports negative
stereotypes about trans people."]{.underline} A student wonders,
"Doesn't a trans man benefit from male privilege when he 'passes?'"
"Yes," I say, "he does, in many cases like any other man." I have
noticed how stu- dents treat me with more respect now than they ever did
before I began hormonal transition. Before, I presumed that they read me
as a gender-nonconforming female, and that they were confused about my
gender. I want to share this but I don't. And it is good that I don't.
Because in the next moment, I notice a student gazing at my crotch. I
feel a shooting of deep discomfort through my body. I presume that he
wonders if I am trans and is looking for "evidence." I can't let on that
I see his expression, because I need to remain in "instructor mode." My
job is to teach the class. I have to contain my anxiety, and I have to
contain the 35 students who are looking at me expectantly, as well as
the one who is looking at me intently, concentrating on the last part of
my body I want attention on. [I feel mixed feelings, writing about this
nascent teaching experience. I wonder whether it is ethical to write
about you, my students. I wonder what you would think or how you would
feel if you read this. I wonder whether it would surprise you to know
that your subtle actions impact me, or whether it would shock you to
know that I am trans. As a transmasculine person, I encounter particular
indignities in everyday life. Interpersonal interactions are often
uncomfortable, sometimes painful. Analyzing the case of my transgender
life, its melding with others', and the parallels with the monster's
life in Shelley's Frankenstein, I explore sensations of selves and
others, separations within and between selves and others, and
possibilities for reconnection and freedom. Claiming humanity in my
monstrosity as a transsexual, I make my monstrosity human. Charting my
socioemotional gendered transitions on my gender journey, I expose
others' marginalizing actions, I question the locatedness of
positionalities, and I make my many selves legible. I aim to build
connections across difference, with you, reader, for cisgender3 people
and for shape-shifters alike, so that we might see ourselves in each
other, and that, together, we might work against injustice and distance,
and toward a deeper kind of intimacy and freedom for us all. It is April
of 2012, a year since I began testosterone treatment. I am 32 years old.
You might wonder who I am now. I am not a different self, but my social
locations are shifting. I prefer to consider, not who, but how am I,
now? Under what circum- stance am I, now? (Minh-ha, 1989). What contexts
shape me, what movements make me? I want to share with you about the
last year and the few years before]{.underline}. In my journey, I have
felt many feelings. I have experienced the world experiencing me in
drastically different ways. People respond to me very dif- ferently when
they read me as female from how they do when they read me as male, and
when they cannot read my gender. Yet, I am the same person, even as I
transition. As we all are, I am a betweener (Diversi & Moreira, 2009).
Marcelo Diversi and Claudio Moreira define betweener as an
"(un)conscious body experiencing life in and between two cultures"
(Diversi & Moreira, 2009, p. 19). [Betweeners who cross between two
cultures are under- stood in terms of race and class differently
depending on the cultural context. I am a slightly different kind of
betweener. Though I do not move between cultures as often as they do, at
different times, I am read differently within the same cul- tural
context. My betweener-ness is complex. It is an in- betweenness. I live
in the in-betweenness of genders and in the borderlands of oppressions.
I live as different kinds of "oppressor" and as different kinds of
"oppressed." I move in the world as White and able-bodied, with
socioeconomic and educational privilege, and as queer. As a transgender
being, my gendered shifting moves me into more betweennesses. I am
queerly between: I occupy multiple positions at once, and different
positions at differ- ent times, depending on how people read me---in
regard to age and ability as well as gender. I am socially subjugated as
transgender, even as I am beginning to experience in a new way what
White male privilege is. And the subjuga- tions of femaleness still
shape my life. In social interac- tions, I still behave, perform, and
position myself in the ways I have habitually done so, as someone who
has been socialized female]{.underline}. I feel the feelings I have
habitually felt as a result of being positioned as female and treated as
inferior. Yet, now people often position me as male in social interac-
tions. In many of these moments, I experience a feeling of inclusion
that I have not ever felt, and in others, I feel excluded in ways I have
never felt. [Yet, at times, the femi- ninity I continue to embody as a
transmasculine1 being leads people to look at me funny. I feel new
feelings par- ticular to transness: anxiety, fear, hypervigilance. It
can be dangerous to be a transsexual. It can be a lot of emotional work
to navigate the cisgender world. I experience sexism, homophobia,
transphobia, and White, male, able-bodied privilege. These positions and
states feel very different from each other. These borderlands of
oppression are places of astonishment, pain, humility, and deep
understanding.]{.underline} My age is queer: I look much younger than I
am. Similarly, I am simultaneously enabled, constrained, and defined by
disability. According to Rosemarie Garland- Thomson (2005), People with
chronic or acute illnesses, appearance impairments such as birthmarks or
fatness, traumatic injuries, congenital impairments or anomalies,
sensory impairments, latent conditions such as HIV or hereditary
conditions, learning disabilities, and mental, developmental, or
emotional illnesses are grouped together under the medical-scientific
rubric of abnormality and its accompanying cultural sentence of
inferiority. (p. 1558) Mine is a complicated (dis)ability status. I take
testosterone. The high levels of androgens in my body enhance some of my
muscular abilities. I am also medically diagnosed with "Gender Identity
Disorder," which classifies me legally as mentally disordered. This
diagnosis is what allows me to obtain testosterone "treatment." My
androgyny might be understood as an "appearance impairment." I am also
simul- taneously privileged and subjugated through the institution of
gender. As I continue to change shape, I am becoming more transsexed. My
body is becoming more monstrous, but my monstrousness is becoming less
outwardly obvious than it was before. I am becoming new betweenings. [I
am self and Other, self-as-Other, and Other-as-self: In various ways, I
am becoming another social way of being. A multiple kind of outsider
within (Collins, 1986)---as a queer female coming into a male body in a
male-dominated soci- ety dominated by heteropatriarchal epistemologies,
and as a trans person in a cisgender-dominated society dominated by
cisgender epistemologies. This is a story about becoming different kinds
of genderednesses and betweennesses. A story about being liminal, moving
between bodies and between locations, and being in many bodies at once.
And a story about being decidedly queer. "Being half in and half out of
identities, subject positions, and discourses, and being fluid in a
world relentlessly searching for stability and cer- tainty]{.underline}"
(Adams & Jones, 2011, p. 114). This story is a body of many stories and
many bodies. An ongoing space-time- body of transit. A queer time and
place (Halberstam, 2005).

#### Monstrosity is revolt -- the embodiment of breaking binaries and irritating/being indiscernible to normative expectations is a praxis of affective resistance.

It is 2 years ago, a time before I began testosterone treatment. I am 30
years old. My gender appears indiscernible to many people. In this
moment, I wish my gender queerness were not so visible. [I have been
moving over the years toward a more male identity, and I no longer enjoy
others' confusion about my body. Now, their energetic intrusions
irritate me.]{.underline} On the bus, I sit, reading. On my way to work.
The fascinating, densely written book requires my full attention. My
eyes trace lines of a paragraph. The words enter and exit my head,
leaving no remnants. I am distracted, thinking about the deadlines I
have to meet soon. In the next moment, I become aware of some other kind
of discomfort. I feel energy reaching out to me. Eyes boring into me.
The unease of being watched. In the menu of gazes, there are many types.
There are the double-takes, the trying-to-be-discreet-corner-of-the-eye
extended glimpses, the persistent looks of confusion, and the more
obvious, blatant stares. I encounter them all. Glancing up, I confront
eyes reaching into me. Eyes oppo- site me, staring openly, shamelessly.
Gawking. Eyes sitting to my right, trying to resist the draw to me,
pretending to be uninterested. I feel their pull into me, the bodies
facing for- ward, the eyes straining as far to the left as they can.
Trying to appear like they are not looking. I feel their strain, the
dull ache of overextending the limit of the organ. These eyes know well
their own rudeness. [**I** feel the pull of their need to see, to
discern for them- selves. Eyes demanding---needing to know. Boy or girl?
Man or woman? This is beyond curiosity. It is desire. It is the wanting
to possess, the intention to extract, it is the mission to obtain for
oneself "Truth." This pull is based on their imagining themselves to be
legitimate knowers. Within the act of staring is the entitlement to
stare, to know, to deter- mine, to proclaim]{.underline} (Serano, 2007).
The internalized belief in oneself as omniscient being: "If I don't
know, it does not exist." The logic of reality through
self-determination, through self-proclamation. And of course, I, as
Other, am not "able" to speak, to know, to determine, to proclaim.
(Spivak, 1988). **[How dare I, as Other, challenge their abili- ties to
"know?" My very ambiguity is an assault to their understanding of
themselves as omniscient. My androgyny fucks with their imagined
able-bodiedness.]{.underline}** Microaggressions The blatant starers
keep on looking. What do I do? I revolt. I glare back. My indignant
anger Moves out of my body. My eyes rip the anger out from inside me.
[The gender-normate to my left tightens her body move- ments. Unease
with my body. This same experience as staree---the receiver of
stares---5 years ago brought me a feeling of excitement. I had felt a
triumphant rush of joy, knowing that I had successfully confused the
people on the bus. I took power in their discombobulated state. I was a
successful gender terrorist. Monstering successfully.]{.underline} Now,
the cumulative experience of strangers' attention to my gender ambiguity
feels like stigma. Eyes exercise power through interacting. Eyes express
feeling, and they elicit feeling. The exercise of looking and being
looked at creates a structure of feeling---a feeling of surveillance.
The eyes are still staring. The energy is smothering. Suffocating. I
feel cornered. Suddenly, I feel hot with rage. Can't they see it? Their
gazing is a continuous attack. Their confusion, which used to feel
exciting to me, now feels like relentless probing. Their faces say: "You
are a freak. You are less than human, a monster." Like Frankenstein's
monster, I wonder, is "there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought
the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me?" (Shelley,
2003, p. 211). How dare they? Have I lost the power of monstrosity? How
have I allowed them to make me a monster? How can I find my gender
terrorist joy again? How can I return my monstrous power to myself?
According to Diversi and Moreira (2009), ["We cannot erase the
oppression in the marked body. But we can allow the wounds to speak up
in their own bodies." So, I can speak. I can speak "from the wound in my
mouth" (Weems, 2003). I can speak in many ways, with words and with
actions. Perhaps speaking through my wounds can create a new way of
seeing.]{.underline} The starers see me seeing them. I feel the corners
of my mouth curling, a growl rising in my throat. My jaw opens to strike
out, to bite them. I look at them, staring back. My face speaks my
anger. Like many starees do, I dare them to keep looking when they can
see me seeing them gawking at me (Garland-Thomson, 2009). The eyes to my
right look away, then. But their energy has not moved; it remains in my
space. I still feel their attunement to my movements, their awareness of
me. After a moment or two, they try to sneak back in. These looks are
"microaggressions," or often unconscious, often indirect, othering
actions (Solorzano, Ceja, & Yosso, 2000). "Rage gives me back my body as
its own fluid medium" (Stryker, 1994, p. 247). I embrace the monster
That I am continuing to become. "Rage throws me back at last into this
mundane reality in this transfigured flesh that aligns me with the power
of my Being" (Stryker, 1994, p. 248). I return the me that I lost to
myself; I sit on my own side, alongside myself, and in so doing, take
back my power. "Through the operation of rage, the stigma itself becomes
the source of transformative power" (Stryker, 1994, p. 249). We, as
shape-shifters, resist abjection by making our own selves. In so doing,
we question and deconstruct dominant epistemologies, which assume the
existence of an essential "self." We acknowledge that ideas of what
constitutes the human and how we know this are just ideas. We create
trans epistemologies, which locate authority to know in the feeling
about our gendered selves. I make "freedom to carve and chisel my own
face, to staunch the bleeding with ashes, to fashion my own gods out of
my entrails" (Anzaldua, 2007, p. 22). [I am not only challenging the
ability of the person on the bus to know my truths. I am challenging the
structures of knowledge and power in this society---the idea of a
knowable, objective "Truth." I am challenging this academy that claims
itself as legitimate knower and knowledge producer and its methods that
claim to be legitimate ways of knowing and producing
knowledge]{.underline}. As a scholar and as a member of society, I
produce knowledge. [I am inside the politics of representation. And I
participate in the politics of the material world. I challenge the
structures of knowledge production even as I maintain them. And I
question my own abilities to know, as I ques- tion others'. In so doing,
I reclaim my monstrous self and power in my monstrosity]{.underline}.
Yet, this self is not ahistorical or decontextual. As I remake myself, I
see and feel the histo- ries, contexts and movements that shape me and
the mean- ing I make of myself and the world. [My body is a site of a
war over mis/recognition and mis/ representation. I am an emoting,
living revolt against the hegemony of gender, though this is not my
point anymore. I am a continuous resistance, whether I mean to be or
not. My corporeality is a weapon that threatens the system of body
normativity. This weapon, my unruly body, demands to be disciplined, to
be stared at. My gender that refuses assimilation is my home, a border,
a wound that runs down the length of my body. My gendered body is a
wound that runs down the length of society, embodying the trauma that
body normativity creates]{.underline}**.** [My embodied, affective
resistance is human, more human than violent eyes. They are inhuman in
their inhumane-ness, their unhuman performativity and
performance.]{.underline}

#### Transgenderment is a form of embodiment that is predicted off of the disfigurement of normative bodies. 

**Koch-Rein 19** (Anson Koch-Rein. Translating the Monster: Transfender
Affect and Frankenstein. 2019. Date Accessed: 7.21.19//ONW)

[The link between transgender and monstrosity is not new]{.underline} --
in the history of monstrosity or in readings of Frankenstein. [The
monster]{.underline}, particularly Shelley's monster, **[is a figure
that allows us to see shifts in the norms of embodiment and subjectivity
and in the forms of knowledge allowed to contest those
norms.]{.underline}** Queer theorist Elizabeth Freeman argues that
Frankenstein makes visible "the conflict between rational and emotional
understanding," suggesting that **[the novel "offers us figures for
witnessing the history of a discredited form of knowledge and for
tracking its afterlife"]{.underline}** (95). While she focuses on
sensory modes of perceiving history, we can see in Freeman's approach
how [Frankenstein offers a figure for witnessing dysphoric knowledge of
gender and transgender embodiment]{.underline}. In fact, the very way
that Freeman discusses historicity through the monster invites
transgender readings. Freeman views the monster's body as
paradigmatically historical (as opposed to concepts of the body as an
ahistorical lump of pre-discursive flesh): "**[Frankenstein's monster,
by contrast, is a body that contains a history of bodies and of
bodiliness and thus figures a gender and a sexuality that themselves
write a history of genders and sexualities.]{.underline}** After
Foucault, the monster suggests, we are all Frankensteinian monsters: or,
after Frankenstein, the Foucauldian body emerges" (103). Frankenstein's
monster, in Freeman's estimation, can be taken as a metaphor of a
Foucauldian understanding of the body -- a genealogical body. [While
Freeman is very much concerned with Frankenstein as a model for how to
think history, her readings of the monster's body are instructive for
the way they emphasize the historicity and contingency of genders and
sexualities]{.underline}. This dimension is, as we will see, central to
the way the monster figures in relation to transgender, and most
prominently so in relation to the medically transitioned body, because
of its comparatively short history (in the history of medicine as well
as in the history of each individual body) and thus seemingly more
obvious historicity. In the Abnormal lectures, Foucault uses the
"hermaphrodite" as a figure that allows him to mark a change in the idea
of monstrosity, which he describes as the beginning of the disappearance
of the figure of the monster and the advent of the abnormal individual:
"[The new figure of the monster, which appears at the end of the
eighteenth century and is at work at the start of the nineteenth
century, is elaborated, or begins to be elaborated, around the question
of hermaphrodites]{.underline}" (66). The examples of historical
"hermaphrodites" Foucault refers to range widely in how they might
possibly be classified in today's terms. His descriptions include a
broad mix of sartorial, sexual, partner, and social role practices that
cannot be resolved neatly into current categories (e.g. intersex,
homosexuality, or transgender) precisely because of the discursive shift
Foucault [describes. The original "hermaphrodite" was in all their
"monstrous" unintelligibility then -- and biomedically reshuffled
categorical unintelligibility now -- a figure mixing not just supposedly
male and female, but a much larger range of dimensions of gender and
sexuality]{.underline}. It may be too narrow, then, to make the
"hermaphrodite" figure only the blueprint of a development from
somatically monstrous first to morally monstrous conduct later. While
Foucault's tracing of this two-step development is convincing for the
court cases regarding partnering and sexual conduct that he discusses,
when generalized, it emphasizes only those aspects of the historical
"hermaphrodite" that turn into the homosexual, ["a monstrosity of
conduct rather than the monstrosity of nature," while other aspects of
gender diversity and sexed embodiment]{.underline} with their own
(psycho)medical and sexological histories disappear from view (73).
**[The transgender aspects of monstrous gender diversity and
homosexuality take separate paths, which will cross again -- one heading
for abnormality, one for respectability]{.underline}** -- in the history
of the DSM, where, as Wen Liu notes, with the depathologization of
homosexuality, "the shame of homosexual desire is transformed into the
shame of gender variance in psychiatric diagnoses" (57). David
Valentine, in his ethnography on the political history of this
differentiation of gender variance from homosexuality, argues that
transgender as a term is rooted in this sexological tradition and gains
traction in 1990s LGBT activism, in part, because it serves to separate
privatized homosexuality from "gender transgression" (33, 40, 64, 59).

Everything's fucked up beyond all recognition.

This hurts too much to go on.

I came as close today as I'll ever come to giving birth -- literally.

My body can't do that;

I can't even bleed without a wound, and yet I claim to be a woman.

How? Why have I always felt that way?

I'm such a goddamned freak.

I can never be a woman like other women, but I could never be a man.

Maybe there really is no place for me in all creation.

I'm so tired of this ceaseless movement.

I do war with nature.

I am alienated from Being.

I'm a self-mutilated deformity, a pervert, a mutant, trapped in
monstrous flesh.

God, I never wanted to be trapped again.

I've destroyed myself.

I'm falling into darkness, I am falling apart.

I enter the realm of my dreams.

I am underwater, swimming upwards.

It is dark.

I see a shimmering light above me.

I break through the plane of the water's surface with my lungs bursting.

I suck for air -- and find only more water.

My lungs are full of water.

Inside and out I am surrounded by it.

Why am I not dead if there is no difference between me and what I am in?

There is another surface above me and I swim frantically towards it.

I see a shimmering light.

I break the plane of the water's surface over and over and over again.

This water annihilates me.

I cannot be, and yet -- an excruciating impossibility -- I am.

I will do anything not to be here.

I will swim forever.

I will die for eternity.

I will learn to breathe water.

I will become the water.

If I cannot change my situation I will change myself.

### 1NC -- Link - Black Monstrosity 

#### Forcing confrontation with the monstrosity of post-slavery is an effective psychological praxis that helps situate the positions of Black people in an ongoing history of relations to whiteness and to the past that "we are still living".

[To see the black silhouettes of the African American visual artist Kara
Walker in a gallery installation is to be caught up in the scenes and
therefore in the actions of the figures that populate them. Walker's
scenes of profound, excessive sexual(ized) violence incorporate all of
her viewers and produce a number of anxious, often hysterical responses
from some of her critics, both those who applaud her work and those for
whom it is regressive, minstrelsy]{.underline}. Each of her (primarily
white) critics that I read reading Walker has specific blind spots that
appear to me symptomatic of the ways that American post-slavery
subjectivity is constituted, conferred, and (not) acknowledged. While
each viewer/critic proceeds from the awareness that the subjects
depicted in the images are both black and white---given the titles of
the work (for example, The End of Uncle Tom and the Grand Allegorical
Tableau of Eva in Heaven, 1995), the subject of the work (slavery), and
Walker's own accompanying explanations---the black black figures in her
silhouetted work nonetheless tend to become the sole site on which the
signifying power of slavery in the past and the present is put to work.
In other words, the majority of critics, readers, and reviewers, regard-
less of their diegetic reading of the work, locate its signifying effect
almost exclusively on black people. Such myopia is unsurprising given
that the history of slavery (and race) in the United States tends to be
regarded as an issue of and for black people about black people and
involves a per- sistent erasure of whiteness. I suspect that it was in
order to work against that persistent perceptual repression of the
whiteness of the diegetically white black figures from her work and
therefore remove them beyond the scope of slavery that Walker added to
recent installations white figures and gray backgrounds and used light
and overhead projection in some of her later silhouette work, additions
that make the viewer's, any viewer's/every viewer's, interpellation by
the scene much more difficult to disavow. To enter the gallery space is
to enter into the exhibit, to step in front of the projector, to always
be included, to appear as one of the shadows on the wall; the scene that
now includes the viewer is transformed into a three- dimensional tableau
vivant. In The Attendant the tableaux come to life in color out of the
narrative of the film, which is in black and white; Walker's silhouetted
tableaux come to life through their abstraction to a pure black-
and-white form. Walker turns to the silhouette, a domestic art, a
prephotographic form that is distant from yet appears familiar to
contemporary viewers,∞ in order to pose and then attempt to answer her
own questions: ''Was it possible for me to make the art that should have
been made by a woman like me before the turn of the last century? Using
just the methods available to her coupled with a 'lofty ambition' and
'checkered past?' '' (Saltz 1996, 82). The silhouette is a form of
remembering that is a blank form ''with its own deep origins in bodily
absence and sentimental memory'' (Wagner 2003, 94), a popular art form
that reached its height in the mid-nineteenth century, at a time
coincident with the final years of the institution of slavery, the Civil
War, and Reconstruction, but also with the rise of the photographic
image and discourses of scientific racism. [The silhouette allows Walker
to produce the admittedly historically impossible and yet theoretically
necessary imaginative work of placing herself and the viewer into the
material conditions of the past that is not yet past ''using just the
methods available to her'' in order to better understand the past's
omni- presence in the present. We see in her silhouetted slavery
tableaux a brutal past that has not been captured fully in language or
that has been captured but that we cannot hold; the beating of Aunt
H/Esther by Captain An- thony as well as its specific effects on
Douglass are two instances of this: the blood-stained gate that on his
subsequent rewritings of the narrative Douglass expunges while keeping
and invigorating his graphic descrip- tions of the ritualized beating.
Another is our refusal still to really look at Aunt H/Esther. We see in
Walker's work, among other things, a visual representation of the slave
narratives and neo-slave narratives and their long reach into the
present]{.underline}. These formalized reductions, these would-be
stereotypes seem to point away from those enslaved persons who wrote or
narrated their own stories of slavery and escape and instead to point to
those enslaved people who appear as so many black forms in the
background of those narratives as well as in other anti- and pro-slavery
texts.≤ In other words, one can read the black black figures that
populate Walker's work as the black back- ground against which
difference (from self and from others) can be erased and constituted. In
anti- and pro-slavery narratives these black black figures are often the
background, the black difference, against which a black individual
emerges to write herself or himself as, or to be written as,
extraordinary. [One can read Walker's black black figures that appear to
be devouring themselves and each other, who fuck, fight, stab, shit,
suck, puncture, beat, and survive and are also fucked, fought, stabbed,
shit upon, suckled, punc- tured, beaten, and nonetheless survive, as
those transfigured enslaved peo- ple (the black black background) who
were able to survive the violence and brutality in the disfiguring
institution of slavery. I read Walker's cut- outs as representing a
violent past that is not yet past in such seductive forms that black and
white viewers alike find themselves, as if against their will, looking
and looking again.≥ For white viewers this act of looking at Walker's
allegories of slavery often entails a seduction by or complicity with
violent acts of reading, seeing, naming, and fixing into stereotype that
resolves in disavowal and projection. For black viewers this looking can
mean encountering shame and violence and sometimes refusing this rep-
resentation or sometimes being seduced into and complicit with violent
acts of reading, seeing, naming, and fixing into stereotype; it means
en- gaging with the disfigurations of black survival that we would
prefer to look away from]{.underline}.∂ Walker says that she arrives at
her technique by way of acknowledging her ''particular upbringing, and
by necessity the his- tory which fostered a creature like \[her\] in the
American suburbs'': ''I thought, here I am, the product of an ambitious
black family, pretty well- assimilated---which is code word for 'knows a
lot of white people'---and trained in their way of seeing . . . which
includes absorbing their racist visions (about me) large and small.
There's a certain amount of shame in admitting to this life of mine, and
it was shame---the opposite of the pride, black pride in
particular---that began to interest me. I thought, for visual resources
I should look really in those places where embarrassment lay'' (Boerma
2002, 166).∑ This brings me back to the shame (and complicity) involved
in looking at, and the dangers involved in circulating, Douglass's
description of the violation of Aunt H/Esther. [I return to Douglass and
H/Esther in this chapter in order to underscore the necessity in my
grappling with Walker's work, of really looking at those enslaved black
people (like Aunt H/Esther)---who are extraordinary mostly because they
survived a brutality that still cannot be grasped,∏ that is not over,
that we may be said to still be surviving (in and dying from)---and of
attempting to look at shame itself, in order to try to account for its
eruption into the present. Put another way, what Walker's work reveals
about shame, in- as much as it is not an individual shame, necessitates
also looking at ''those places where embarrassment lay,'' at the shame
that ''black pride in par- ticular'' disavows. At stake are the results
of a continued looking away]{.underline}. Walker's black paper cutouts
(figures and forms cut out and then affixed to a white wall) that
allegorize the antebellum United States also take the plantation romance
of Margaret Mitchell and then David O. Selznick's Gone With the Wind at
their word, for example, in Gone: An Historical Romance of a Civil War
as It Occurred between the Dusky Thighs of One Young Negress and Her
Heart (1994; figure 16). Walker's work reveals what is everywhere
present in the plantation romance, what is in plain sight and denied,
and what in its denial functions even still in its remainders. Taken as
complicated responses to the conception of and investment in the
plantation romance's rewriting of slavery's profound and varied violence
as seduction, affection, intimacy, and mutual benefit---or as perfectly
natural relationships---Walker's flat black-and-white glyphic forms
reveal what the melodrama conceals. Such highly charged psychosexual
violence is everywhere present in the work of Kara Walker. In my
discussion of Walker's silhouettes I again want to emphasize the
formation of the post-slavery subject that has been the connecting theme
of the previous three chapters. While my focus here is on Euro-American
and African American post-slavery subjectivity, the post-slavery subject
is, of course, not limited to these subject positions. As Toni Morrison
reminds us, ''The overweening, defining event of the mod- ern world is
the mass movement of raced populations, beginning with the largest
forced transfer of people in the history of the world: slavery. The
consequences of which transfer have determined all the wars following it
as well as the current ones being waged on every continent'' (1997, 10).
The link that Walker insists on between past and present, seen in the
traumatic registers of post-slavery subjectivity (and, for her,
specifically a Georgia desegregating with ''all deliberate speed''),π
does not mean that she attempts a naïve collapse of their spatiotemporal
distance in her work. Rather her works are allegories for the present;
as Walker says, she goes back to this form, this history, ''to critique
it and to question why it's reoccurring'' (Saltz 1996, 82), much the
same way that Toni Morrison's Beloved can be said to tell about freedoms
claimed, granted, assumed, and withheld post-emancipation as well as
about desegregation after Brown v. Board of Education. The initial
''driving force'' for Walker's exploration of the past in the present
that takes the particular form of the black ''burden of representation''
was a decision to ''investigate interracial desire'': ''I think it maybe
started from that. And the ways in which it seemed, in my life, to
challenge set stereotype notions about blackness and whiteness and how
they're operating in Georgia, where I was.'' A personal encounter left
her with what she identifies as a desire to understand ''the feeling of
being thrust into history for walking down the street with a white man
by some outside force---say a Ku Klux Klan or a guy who leaves a flyer
on \[one's\] car after spotting this illicit liaison. . . . The feeling
of walking and talking and having to be historical somehow, bearer of
some truth of history'' (1999). Considering Walker's articulations of
self in relation to history, her ''walking and talking and having to be
historical'' and bear ''some truth of history,'' I focus a large part of
my reading of her work on her construction of the mammy (as the
''embodiment of history''), and I argue that that figure is one through
which Walker links our antebellum past to our post- slavery,
postintegration present. Walker's shadow plays draw our attention to the
ways that the act of entering into those other bodies, ''playing the
slave'' (or the master, entering into the ever present traces of the
planta- tion romance), continues to be constitutive of subjectivity for
all of those who I am calling post-slavery subjects. Walker's early
self-presentation as ''the Negress'' and ''Missus K. E. B. Walker, a
Free Negress of Noteworthy Talent'' and her focus on violence, power,
and desire in her work and in her statements about her work have been
unsettling to many of her viewers, readers, and critics. This is mani-
fest in the extremity of her critical reception: she has been praised
lavishly and criticized for her historically informed and deformed,
complex and ambivalent representations of self and slavery. As Thelma
Golden says, ''Kara's work takes from fact but also fantasy and throws
on its head any notion we might have of good and bad, right and wrong,
black and white. **[There are no clear dichotomies'' (Sheets 2002, 26).
Walker's silhouettes depict the centrality of what passes as the
underbelly of and vestibular to the plantation romance; she exposes the
relationships that construct us all.]{.underline}**

#### The historical injustice of contemporary injections of whiteness into readings of history are the de-racialization and sanitization of the histories of relationality. Cultivating the image and mythos of the monstrous subject and the graphic nature of the violences of history re-contextualizes history and calls out white moves to innocence while simultaneously re-centering our critique.

**[The horror of slavery was its absolute domesticity that configured
the ''peculiar institution'' into the architectonics of the southern
household.]{.underline}** --- HORTENSE SPILLERS, ''Changing the Letter''
[Once you get a clear grasp on the fundamentals of history; who's
writing it, what emotions are involved in reshaping it, what kinds of
people are subjected to it--- well, like being the guinea-pig . . .
European style enlightenment: ''Thems that are most doomed to repeat it
are thems that believe in it''---taking history like a faith, a new
religion of time and events and more time and more events.--- KARA
WALKER, Flash Art **Hortense Spillers begins her essay ''Mama's Baby,
Papa's Maybe: An Amer- ican Grammar Book'' with a series of meaningful
and constitutive dis- placements, projections, misnamings, and
blindnesses that locate the gaze. The one doing the looking insists on
the ability to see, to name, and to fix into stereotype black women.
''Let's face it,'' she writes, ''I am a marked woman, but not everybody
knows my name. 'Peaches' and 'Brown Sugar,' 'Sapphire' and 'Earth
Mother,' 'Aunty,' 'Granny,' 'God's Holy Fool,' a 'Miss Ebony First,' or
'Black Woman at the Podium': I describe a locus of confounded
identities, a meeting ground of investments and privations in the
national treasury of rhetorical wealth. My country needs me and if I
were not here, I would have to be invented'' (2003c, 203). Her list of
names describes a social identity effect that includes but far exceeds
any particu- lar impact on individual and collective black women.** To
Spillers's list of ''confounded identities'' and nominative properties I
add the encompassing figure of the mammy, who ''from her beginnings in
southern plantation reality and literature . . . was a sexual and racial
symbol that was used by men and women, North and South, white and black,
to explain proper gender relationships, justify or condemn racial
oppression, and establish class identities (for both whites and
blacks)'' (Manring 1998, 9). The figure of the mammy is a quintessential
example of the national and rhetorical wealth that Spillers
articulates.]{.underline} The mammy spans more than a century; pictured
on pancake boxes as Aunt Jemima, embodied in salt and pepper shakers,
door stoppers, string holders, and memo peg boards---products intimately
connected to the U. S. domestic scene---her figure is strangely
omnipresent in popular and high culture, advertising, literature, film,
and music. There is an uncanny pleasure lo- cated in U. S. culture in
the Aunt Jemima or mammy figure and her many appearances. But despite
the proliferation of images and objects, who is this mammy? Do we
recognize her by her bulk, her headscarf, her mixing bowl and apron, her
domestic busyness, simple moral correctness, or simply by her blackness?
''It is indisputable,'' writes M. M. Manring, ''that there were slave
women called 'mammy,' that these women supervised other house slaves,
cooked, and watched children. It is also indisputable that even children
and housewives of postbellum America fondly remember a woman called
mammy, who played much the same role. But even those who are abso-
lutely certain that they know the person called mammy have trouble
explaining everything they think she did'' (1998, 19). A house slave and
then a domestic, but not fully domesticated, for the viewer she is
an(other) indicator of desire and its absence, a placeholder, a cipher.
With so much projected into and onto her figure, no wonder the mammy
becomes large, superabundant, splits into more of herself. Impossible to
contain her in one body, impossible not to see her, she circulates
widely but remains invisible nonetheless. Having, as Walker says, no
place in the memory of her creators as a creation she becomes a realized
figment of collective imagination, an avatar of the collective
unconscious. A phantasmatic fig- ure, she is everywhere, in every place.
The mammy is, in Walker's words (specifically in the text of ''The Big
Black Mammy of the Antebellum South Is the Embodiment of History''),
''history as a critical muttering thing, suckling your young, and
ignored by her creators . . . To all who have fed on the often sour
breast milk of the wandering Mammy-as-History it comes as no surprise
that history has been declared dead . . . Mammies in popular
consciousness cease to exist, She has no place . . . The big black mammy
is the object of Oedipal longing within the plantation family romance .
. . sucked and fucked she is the ultimate 'earth-mother' wholly
submissive yet defiant. . . . she is pairs in opposition she is
incomplete and unknown and inconsistent and repressed . . .'' (1997;
emphasis mine). While the figure of the mammy appears in various forms
in much of Walker's work, in this section I focus in particular on an
image from the larger work The End of Uncle Tom and the Grand
Allegorical Tableau of Eva in Heaven. I emphasize that this is an image
of at least four figures to allow for the way that Walker's silhouettes,
like the blot of figure against ground in Rorschach tests, also bring
into focus the white space/figure in the midst of the figure(s) of black
suckling women/girls. What is this image, the art critic Jerry Saltz
asks Walker, ''in the left side of one of the panels . . . this
incredible image of four women--- girls and women---suckling each
other\[?\] What was this meant as a meta- phor for?'' (1996, 185; figure
17). Walker responds, ''History. My constant need or, in general, a
constant need to suckle from history, as though history could be seen as
a seemingly endless supply of mother's milk represented by the big black
mammy of old. For myself, I have this con- stant battle---this fear of
weaning. It's really a battle that I apply to the black community as
well, because all of our progress is predicated on having a very tactile
link to a brutal past'' (85). We must keep in mind the visual impact of
the large-scale cutout image of the condensed black form of three women
suckling each other and the baby attempting to suckle one of the three,
and that there is nothing that specifically identifies the women
individually or collectively as the stereo- typical ''big black mammy of
old.'' There is an immediate disjunction, a gap that opens up, between
the perception of the powerful image and Walker's explanation of it. In
what follows I explore Walker's explanation of the image and the critic
Joan Copjec's reading of it in ''Moses the Egyptian and the Big Black
Mammy of the Antebellum South: Freud (with Kara Walker) on Race and
History.''∞∞ I consider both Walker's and Copjec's positioning of the
symbolic, historical, and familiar figure of the mammy not only as
history but also as an object that becomes internalized. Finally, I look
at black and white resistance to being interpellated by the scene.
Writing about the image of the suckling women, Copjec cautions, ''We
must not lose sight of what is most extraordinary about the portrait;
its analogization of history and the maternal breast. For if we insist
on distin- guishing the mother from the breast, as I have argued we
must, then the analogy becomes both more profound and a more
enlightening clue to Walker's artistic project. What does it mean to
think of history not as a mother, that is, not as a container that holds
subjects as part of its con- tents, but as an internal object that lives
the subject as the double of another?'' (2002, 104; emphasis mine). But
in addition to distinguish- ing the mother from the breast, we must also
differentiate between the mammy('s breast) and the mother's (maternal)
breast, and then again between the breast of the mother substitute and
the milk. I do not mean to say that the maternal breast is the same as
the mother's breast; I wish instead to turn our focus to the distinction
between the mammy (black), who may in deed, if not in law, be a mother
(who also might mother white children) on the one hand, and a mother
(presumed to be white) on the other hand; a distinction between the wet
nurse's (black) breast and the maternal (white) breast. In calling the
breast of the enslaved woman a maternal breast, we must remember that
she is denied the rights and privileges of both womanhood and
motherhood. Such naming would grant her a legal status as well as ''a
'feminization' that enslavement kept at bay'' (Spillers 2003c, 215).
Nonetheless the mammy performs a---often the---maternal function in the
white household.∞≤ Connecting this back to Walker's statement, in her
description of the vignette, history is not the (maternal) breast; it is
the ''seemingly endless supply'' of ''mother's milk represented by the
big black mammy of old.'' Indeed what is most extraor- dinary about
Walker's reading of the portrait (which is not, I think, specifi- cally
about the portrait itself) is that what she analogizes is the mammy-
as-history-as-mother's-milk. I imagine Walker imagining ''the
fantasmatic scene of black white suckling, . . . disguised in the
generic costume of mammy . . . \[in which\] the construction of
whiteness comes at a cost---the installation of envy of what is posited
as blackness in those who take themselves to be white'' (St. John 2001,
151). Likewise when Walker speaks of a ''constant battle---this fear of
wean- ing. It's really a battle that I apply to the black community as
well, because all of our progress is predicated on having a very tactile
link to a brutal past'' (quoted in Copjec 2002, 98), I take this to be
an articulation of the profound anxiety around the painful emergence of
the black object as subject and around the making visible in Walker's
installation of some- thing like innocence in the ''subject
presumed-to-be-white'' (St. John 2001, 151).∞≥ By ''innocence'' I mean
to indicate the absence of the violence in being (mis)seen. In this
image of four suckling women/girls in which one can also see in the
white ground a phantasmatic white figure suckling the breast of one of
the black women, that innocence means the erasure of white suckling
through recourse to a readable black (narrative) image or glyph. In the
context of Walker's description of the women/girls and child as the big
black mammy of old, what Copjec registers in her reading of the
repetition of suckling women is ''the woman's reencountering of
difference from herself'' (2002, 103). The ''big black mammy'' is
halved, quartered, redoubled, quadrupled; whichever way we see her, she
is constantly re- produced by our need, by the post-slavery subject's
need, to be connected to some tangible thing (history, myth) that
constitutes us even as we are unable to see it or even as we refuse to
acknowledge it. Suckling and being suckled---arranged in a circle, the
black figures appear to be of various ages---the women/girls and child
are held together as not quite one image and as not yet four as much by
the white ground between and around them as by their figures merging
with and arising out of each other, their mouths attached to breasts. If
one were to break apart Walker's black suckling figures, to sever their
''tangible link to a brutal history'' that is both past and present, one
would see as well the white figure in their midst that has gone unseen
because the gaze that is drawn to and reads the black figures as doubly
black and endlessly repetitive ignores the white ground. Let's return to
the black figures in Walker's image: three women suck- ling and being
suckled by each other and an infant reaching for a breast, a nipple,
that is either just out of reach or hasn't yet been grasped, to ask if
this is necessarily, and therefore only, an image of black women/girls,
and hence only enacted self-difference. For if we read the image
diegetically, the breast of the black-woman-read-as-mammy that is just
out of reach may just as easily be out of the reach of the white infant
as out of the reach of the mammy's own child. Mammy, as she is called up
in the ''white imagination,'' exists, after all, not to feed the
children she gave birth to, but to feed and care for the white children,
the white family. Even as the repeated (but different) women suckle each
other the breast/milk is out of reach of the white/black infant. We are
accustomed to the mammy's inability to feed the black child, trapped as
she is in the white household, suckling their young instead of her own,
but what of an inability, a refusal to feed the white one? How would we
recognize that? How would history account for that possibility? Repeated
images that produce the mammy as a comforting presence and comic relief
in the white household (as St. John notes, her body a cookie jar, her
breast caught in a washing machine wringer, her mouth an ashtray, her
behind exposed as she leans over) are matched in number by the images of
the mammy's own unsupervised children in all kinds of danger (swallowed
up by watermelons, devoured by alligators, left to fend for
themselves).∞∂ And this difference, which is self-difference as well as
a blank space that is not a blank space into which difference from an
other is projected, is indeed ''both more profound and a more
enlightening clue to Walker's artistic project'' (2002, 104). Recall
that Copjec points out that Walker's response to Saltz's question about
the image (that it is ''as though history could be seen as a seemingly
endless supply of mother's milk represented by the big black mammy of
old'') is unsatisfying not least of all because the image in question
is, of course, not of one black woman but of three women and an infant,
none of whom is distinctly recognizable, without Walker's explanation,
as the ''big black mammy of old.''∞∑ Involved here is also and always a
question of the gaze. For some viewers every black woman regardless of
age, size, and position may be read as a mammy or as one of the mammy's
other incarnations: ''God's Holy Fool,'' ''Black Woman at the Podium,''
''Earth- Mother'' (Spillers 2003c, 203). As Copjec notes, Walker's
answer ''appears merely to restate a popular cliché in which the mother
is viewed as a superabundant source from which future generations draw
and to which all lines of filiation lead back'' (2002, 98). But such a
restating would confuse mammy and mother; more important, it would
obscure the ways that lines of filiation and kinship ran for the
enslaved, for mammy, not for mother, in which neither blood nor milk
ensured familiarity.∞∏ In relation to the ''big black mammy of old'' the
parental function is repeatedly displaced as the fate of the black child
is legally bound to the condition of the enslaved mother, as the ability
to mother that child is denied her, or can always be denied her, and as
the woman legally denied the rights and functions of mother is made to
do the mothering of the white children. What Walker states then seems to
be something entirely different from the ''popular cliché'' of mother as
superabundant source; she seems to be saying that all lines of descent,
all lines of transmission, lead back to the mammy. In Walker's image we
might see enacted the introjection of the figure of the mammy. In this
vignette we might see as well the relationship among the four
generations of the Corregidora women in Gayl Jones's Corregidora, in
which the women are held together by their emphasis on reproduction, on
passing on evidence, on making the horrors of slavery as ''visible as
the blood,'' and in reproducing for and reproducing the desires of the
slave owner whoremonger old man Corregidora. Between them, among them,
keeping them attached to each other, ingesting and reproducing this sex-
ually violent history, and suckling the ''sour breast milk'' is a
relationship once legislated and ever present. We see in this image the
connection be- tween old man Corregidora and the generations of
Corregidora women; we see the defining white ground; we see an image of
a sustaining, brutal history that the women transmit from generation to
generation, ending with Ursa.∞π Once Copjec has made this connection
between the image and Walk- er's own explanation of it, an explanation
that at first seems to refuse exegesis and in fact occasions more
questions, she links this plural, other- wise unidentifiable image of
the ''big black mammy of the antebellum South'' to Freud's Egyptian
Moses. For Copjec, when Walker invokes the ''big black mammy of the
antebellum South \[who\] is the embodiment of history'' and Freud
invokes the Egyptian Moses, who, according to Freud's own argument, has
no basis in recorded history but nonetheless seems theoretically
necessary to him to account for the evolution of the myth of Moses into
the form that was written down, each participates in ''equally
scandalous gestures.'' Each ''eschew\[s\] identification with the traits
of empirical (and, one hopes, noble) ancestors as the basis of racial
identity, and both begin their inquiry by wondering how the differences
separating them from others of their race fail to disqualify them
automatically from membership in it'' (91--92). Freud's nonempirical
Moses is irreducible (that is, he persists even after characteristics
that would take him away from the Jews are pared away); in positing him
Freud both ''den\[ies\] a people the man whom it praises as the greatest
of its sons'' (Freud 1939, 9) and insists on the '' 'historical truth'
of his admittedly hypothetical and undocumentable story of the martyred
and resurrected Egyptian Moses and contrast\[s\] it explicitly with the
'material truth' of 'objective historians' '' (Copjec 2002, 91).
Copjec's align- ment of this Moses with the divided black mammy who is
the embodiment of (U.S.) history speaks to the historical and
phantasmatic truth of the mammy as an abject and theoretically necessary
but impossible figure. What are the stories of the women whose only
remaining trace is the mammy? While there are instances of a historical
figure known as Mammy that Walker bases her work on, the parallel that
Copjec draws to Freud's Egyptian Moses is instructive both for what it
makes visible in Walker's work and for how it exposes one of the
blindnesses of Copjec's reading of Walker's work. Although there are
mythic and religious accounts of the Egyptian Moses, what most of us
know is something more like a Moses- effect, the result of condensations
and displacements and resolutions of multiple and conflicting oral
traditions laden with thousands of years of elaboration. Likewise, along
with the histories of the black women who lived as mammies what we know
is something like a mammy-effect, the leftover trace of these historical
mammies that continues to circulate phantasmatically and that is
continually reproduced as an object that continues to ''live the subject
as the double of another'' (Copjec 2002, 104). In other words, the
mammy, however historically based she may be, stands for or in the place
of, is laden with what is accepted as history and its effects; the mammy
naturalizes blackness in the United States. She is animated according to
the work that she is being asked to do: to refute or shore up particular
readings of inter- and intraracial violence and affection in slavery, to
abet consumption, to internalize and articulate intraracial tensions.∞∫
Effectively a mythical character, the mammy does not exist, yet she is
based on the misseen bodies and labor of real black women. Manthia
Diawara writes: As a stereotype, the Mammy is the most powerful symbol
of the South be- cause she is the only one that is necessary and
indispensable to the representa- tion of the entire mythology of the
South. To borrow an insight from Roland Barthes, in Mythologies (1957),
''the Mammy is to the South what the African soldier saluting the French
flag on the cover of Paris-Match was to the French empire: she forms the
identity of the South on the one hand and universalizes the Southern way
of life on the other. Dressed in her long dress, apron, head kerchief,
and big smile, she becomes as natural as cotton.'' (1999, 10) Extending
Diawara's insights, the mammy is the mythic figure who forms the
identity not only of the South; she comes to be a founding figure of the
entire United States. [Resuscitating the mammy in her work and writing
as a phantasmatic figure rather than simply as a historical one, Walker
would seem to cast off a set of positive features ''that ought to have
been the tell-tale source'' of identity (what was Jewishness for Freud
and is blackness for Walker). This casting off, this animation of shame
(''as the opposite of pride, black pride in particular'') is profoundly
distressing to any number of Walker's black critics; it is for them
Walker's setting back into territory that has already been traversed.∞Ω
It is, though, as Walker herself notes, the exploration of shame that is
of particular interest to her (Boerma 2002, 166). This casting off is
both the erasure of positive attributes of blackness and it is black-
ness's signing. In other words, the mammy, her blackness, is analogous
to Moses the Egyptian, ''a fulginous \[sic\] stain that not only Freud
but history and death itself proved incapable of rubbing out'' (Copjec
2002, 92). The ''fuliginous stain'' is residual blackness, blackness
that won't be erased, blackness that allows whiteness to (almost) erase
itself, and black- ness that illuminates what is otherwise unreadable,
unseeable. This fuligi- nous stain, this blackness, works the way that a
black light works: it makes white things show up even more brightly. It
is also like the ten drops of black liquid that the unnamed protagonist
in Invisible Man adds to the white paint, the substance that makes
''Liberty Paints Optic White'' the ''right white.']{.underline}'≤≠ What
Walker's work reveals, what it is so adept at revealing, is that there
is something in excess of what historical narrative gives us. I suggest
that one thing that the figure of the mammy is called up to conceal
appears in the chapter ''TV Guide'' in Phyllis Rose's memoir, The Year
of Reading Proust: A Memoir in Real Time (1997): The colored person who
came to live with us when I was eight was Lily McAllistar. Lily came
from Starr, South Carolina, where her husband, Taft, was a farmer. They
had three children, but Lily had to leave them in South Carolina to be
raised by her mother and Taft's, while she raised me in the North. She
sent home the money my parents paid her, along with long letters,
written on ruled paper in a hand as rounded and hearty as Lily and a
style as cheerful. . . . I had Lily to mother me and only me for several
happy years. Then she told my mother she was quitting, she was too
lonely, and my mother, both in her kindness and in her concern for the
good functioning of her household, offered to hire Taft. So Taft came to
live with us, too, and to work as our ''chauffeur,'' although he did not
know how to drive and by the time he came to us my brother was away at
college and my sister had her own driver's license. . . . It was bad
enough to be driven around by a chauffeur, which was ''different'' at a
time when differ- ence was not admired. . . . It was also clear to me,
although I had never seen a chauffeur except in the movies, that Taft
was not a real chauffeur. A chauffeur was above all competent and
intrepid, whereas Taft was timid and tentative in everything he did. My
mother gave him a chauffeur's hat to wear, but I knew this was a charade
being carried on for the benefit of Taft and Lily for which my father
was footing the bill but I was paying the worst price, humiliation. In
retrospect I envy the well-run household over which my mother presided.
Every morning as I got dressed I could hear the sound of Lily or Taft
vacuum- ing the living room carpet. There was freshly squeezed orange
juice for breakfast. Laundry was done on a regular basis. When I got
home from school in the afternoon, Lily would pour me a glass of milk
and give me some cookies, or cake, or chocolate pudding. She was a fine
cook, but my mother orchestrated the meals, and under her baton chopped
liver might precede spaghetti with meat- balls and Vita herring,
Southern fried chicken. Mother and Lily did better on Jewish holidays
when the menu was traditional and gefilte fish followed matzoh ball soup
and was followed in turn by pot roast or turkey. Here are Rose's
reflections from the analyst's couch, what the analyst helps her
realize: What was unique about me was that no one had hurt me. . . . I
never ''understood'' my childhood because I never understood what a
happy child- hood it was. I had my parents' love and attention. There
was no story to tell except a happy one, and I had been led by whatever
theories or literary models to think that only unhappy childhoods
counted. (1997, 56--57; emphases mine)≤∞ The diegetic subject here is a
child, Rose, looking back on a childhood that she can now, in the
present and with the help of her therapist, recognize and understand to
be a happy one. The narrator's reinstallation of inno- cence, the
recovered innocence of the ''subject-presumed-to-be-white,'' is
predicated on and structured by the myth of the benevolent patriarchy,
the monstrous intimacies of the plantation romance, where the mammy's
labor must be accompanied by the affects of cheer and gratitude and not
read as labor.≤≤ Round, hearty, cheerful Lily's subjectivity and labor
are erased as she comes to embody a number of contradictions. She is a
mother of three away from her children and a disavowed worker (''There
was freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast. Laundry was done on a
regular basis'': note the use of the passive voice), who mothers a child
who is not her own; her body is put in the space of the hyphen that
would otherwise mark the site of the interpellation of the subject as
white. As Maria St. John writes, ''Mammy's cheerful width covers over
the fact that people who identify as white have no essential claim to
the privilege we enjoy by assuming that identity. When mammy appears to
broadcast her natural blackness, she functions to shore up the category
'white' '' (2001, 137 -- 38). [We learn from reading Rose how this
mythologizing and shoring up happen and how they are maintained; we see
black people and black labor elided in Rose's romance just as white
people are elided from many read- ings of Walker's slavery silhouettes.
As part of Rose's construction of her family romance she displaces onto
Lily and Taft the weight of shame and of class, race, gender difference,
and this displacement in turn is part of what allows her in the present
to remember and understand her childhood as a happy one.≤≥ The erasure
of Lily's work and of her loneliness is part of the ''architectonics of
the southern \[and northern\] household'' (Spillers 2003a, 178) that the
dismantling of the institution of slavery does not do away with. That
Lily takes care of the narrator, ''and only her for three years,'' means
that Lily's children have a profoundly different experience of
mothering, a childhood marked by the absence of their mother. Indeed the
mammy's presence often indicates the mother's absence---the white mother
from the white home or the tasks of mothering, the black mother from the
black home---and the transfiguration of the black mother into the mammy
in the home of the white woman. Disguised as or hidden behind good
management, intimacy, affection, and even love, a monstrous inti- macy
is at the center of the production of white subjectivity vis-à-vis the
introjection of the figure of the mammy. The mammy becomes an object
that circulates, with effects. Rose's story has in it the innocence of
those millions of people who consume the comforting and familiar
phantas- matic aura of Aunt Jemima.]{.underline} According to Rose's
narrator, the ''worst price'' of Lily's and Taft's labor is not their
absence from their own home, not Lily's cheerful caretaking of her in
the face of loneliness, but the narrator's own humiliation at the
''charade being carried on'' for the ''benefit of Taft and Lily.'' Again
the gaze is crucial to observe here. What makes being chauffeured to
school the worst price for the narrator is that driven to school by
Taft, she is suddenly in the position of seeing others seeing her
dropped off at school by him. Not only is Taft an unwanted chauffeur,
but the ''timid and tentative'' Taft is not even a real chauffeur. In
the narrator's seeing and being seen lies the recognition of Lily's and
Taft's labor, of class, race, power, and gender that must be concealed,
kept at home in order to produce a narrative of a happy (innocent)
childhood. It is this that Rose (and the therapist) need to cover over,
and that Walker attempts to make visible. For a white subject to be seen
(to see oneself ) as a white subject in the Walker vignette on which
this chapter focuses would fracture the fantasy that constructs the
mammy as (like) part of the family. This is a fracturing that simply
cannot be allowed. Whatever humiliation the narrator feels from being
seen having servants must be buried under the force of nostal- gia
encouraged by her therapist. The pursuit of happiness with which Rose's
tale ends does not extend to the unremarked-upon childhoods of Lily's
and Taft's children. The cruelty of Rose's reflection (the monstrous
intimacy) is that in remembering she seeks to erase what she experienced
as a child being driven to school by Taft when her anxiety emerged for
the reasons she details and as a symptom of that experience. Her
recognition of Lily and Taft remains disavowed. [There is thus an
''exorbitant pleasure'' (Copjec's term) in Rose's looking back and in
her innocence here that repeats the erasure of the mammy, which in fact
confirms Walker's rendition of the mammy in that particu- lar vignette,
as circulating, introjected. There is a similar pleasure to be found on
the part of those (white) (re)viewers of Walker's work who absent
themselves from her dialectical practice while rehearsing a whole
catalogue of names and acts for the black characters in the silhouettes.
Both positions involve a retrospective assumption of nostalgic innocence
that allows Rose to understand her childhood as a happy one by the
covering over of black characters to save her innocence and also allows
(white) viewers and critics of Walker's work to insist that her images
are ''about'' black people, thereby covering over the white characters
to preserve ''white innocence.'' There is, however, no plantation
romance or plantation slavery without white people, and Walker's
silhouettes contain many diegetically white characters in the black
cutouts as well as in the white ground.]{.underline} This brings me back
to Copjec's reading of Freud's Egyptian Moses and Mammy and to her
erasure of white figures, white people, from Walker's work. Again, I
suspect that this persistent erasure is why some of Walker's later work
includes overhead projectors and light so that the gallery visi- tors
cast shadows. It is a didactic tool, Walker notes, that reinforces each
viewer's participation in the scene unfolding before him or her. There
are other, not so happy stories to tell here; one of them might be about
how the U.S./American ''subject-presumed-to-be-white'' becomes white and
the presumptive U.S./American subject stays white. The post-slavery
subject---black, white, male, female---stems from the mammy in the mode
of the ancient Hebrews stemming from Moses; both are a reconciliation of
competing and contradictory historical characters and historical
perspec- tives into a consolidated myth.

#### Confrontation with present-day subjectivites relies on the key pre-condition of a horrific historical foregrounding. In art pieces that recreate the past world of enslavement -- the horror, pain, and monstrosity racializes our understanding of violence and keeps the spectator accountable to past violence in the present.

How can a would-be white subject consciously entertain and thus work
through envy of the black female figure when the cultural ''fact'' of
her worthlessness is reinforced at every discursive and institutional
turn? In what image can he recognize his love of her when her
reproduction is synonymous with her debasement? How can he speak of her
inestimable value to him when her devaluation constitutes the very basis
on which the economy he was born into perpetuates itself ? --- M A R I A
S T . J O H N , '' 'It Ain't Fittin': Cinematic and Fantasmatic Contours
of Mammy in Gone with the Wind and Beyond'' When Jerry Saltz asks Walker
how the silhouette functions in her work, she replies, ''It's a blank
space, but it's not at all a blank space, it's both there and not
there'' (Saltz 1996, 82). The silhouette is projection; it is what
remains after something has been cut away, and it is the thing that has
been cut away. [The silhouette is also like the stereotype, ''blank in
\[its\] generality, and yet powerfully present in \[its\] introjection
by the stereo- typed subjects and their racial others'']{.underline}
(Joselit 2000, 31). For Walker the silhouette is also about
''indirection,'' an ''avoidance of the subject.'' In her descriptions of
Walker's most well-known and recognizable work, Copjec writes,
''Composed of black paper, all the human figures are, tech- nically,
black, though we are able to distinguish the diegetically white 'folk'
from the diegetically black on the basis of their stereotypical
profiles, postures, and clothing. Glued to the walls the figures become
part of their flat surface rather than standing out in front of them as
they would had they been mounted on canvas'' (2002, 83). In comparing
Mammy to Freud's Moses, Copjec in one way explicates what Rose's
therapist allowed Rose to avoid. And while she is aware that some of the
characters in the cutouts are white, nevertheless Copjec repeats what is
standard in white critics' readings of Walker: the (white) viewer
ascribes race to the black figures that adhere to the wall through a
calculation of features (hair tex- ture and style, profile, clothing,
etc.) into a racial equation of, in Copjec's words, ''Hottentot harlots,
sambos, mandingos, Uncle Toms, churls and scallywags of every sort
\[who\] engage nonchalantly in violent and licentious acts of
parturition, sodomy, cannibalism, and coprophany, as well as in other
acts we have no idea how to name'' (2002, 93). [Race, like slavery, is
read as entirely about black people, and everyday reading practices
become reified in these descriptions. In other words, we are taken away
from the fact that race is read through ''a calculation of features''
all of the time. Mark Reinhardt writes, ''With a knowing inversion of
the one-drop rule that labels even the palest skin 'black,' Walker first
brings before the viewer the usually unnamed and unseen codes of
racializing vision'' (2003, 113). Aware of the existence of the
diegetically white black figures, Copjec's reading is caught up by
Walker's cutups in a way that she herself would call symptomatic. Copjec
knows that these charac- ters represent black and white people of
various classes, slave and free, but she proceeds to list only
diegetically black characters and to discuss the actions of the cutouts
as if they were only black performances: The ''plantation family
romances,'' as Walker calls her vignettes, have not been warmly received
by everyone. In the black community, particularly, they re- main
controversial, with many blacks fiercely agitating against the work and
even mounting letter-writing campaigns to protest her exhibitions. The
prob- lem for these protestors is that rather than narratives confirming
the dignity of the race or reflecting the actual achievements and steady
integrity of a down- trodden but spirited people, rather than positive
and uplifting images of de- fiant or self-sacrificing and virtuous
blacks, Walker's nursery-rhyme raunchy vignettes offer a fulguration of
uncouth ''sex pickaninnies.'' Hottentot harlots, sambos, mandingos,
Uncle Toms, churls and scallywags of every sort engage nonchalantly in
violent and licentious acts of parturition, sodomy, cannibalism, and
coprophany, as well as in other acts we have no idea how to name. The
charge made against Walker is both that her representations are sexually
and racially derogatory and that they have no basis in fact but simply
recycle stereotypes found in that racist memorabilia or Americana that
Walker, like many other blacks, admits to collecting. What she calls her
''inner planta- tion,''≤]{.underline}∂ [this criticism implies, has been
implanted in her by white racists; she owes it to herself, and her race,
not to recreate these fictions, but to exorcise them through a recovery
of her actual, truthful, and by the way, glorious origins. (2002,
84--91; emphasis mine)]{.underline} We might ask why it is important
that these acts (which Copjec has ''no idea how to name'') have a name,
and what it might mean that Walker represents acts for which we, or at
least Copjec, who names with such deliberateness, have descriptions but
no names. Naming is, I suspect, a way to refuse an act or a position,
much like Copjec's description of Walker's black critics fixes into
stereotype varied objections and interven- tions under the label of
''protestors.'' The black artist and art historian Howardeena Pindell is
one person who has been critical of Walker's work and its circulation.
About the controversy over Walker's work Pindell reflects on two groups
and their responses: black people in the art world and black people from
''more conservative sectors.'' She writes: Recently there has been a
swift negative response from a number of African- American artists, art
historians, and museum curators to the rapid embrace of Kara Walker. . .
. There has been, however, a muffled, restrained, fearful response from
more conservative sectors of the African-American community, perhaps
fearful because of the ostracism and trivialisation of those who object,
by those behind the trend. . . . I feel that artists who use racial
stereotypes without critique become com- plicit. They are reinforcing
the old stereotype as if to say the fabricated image is their true
experience. Thus, in the visual industries' uneven playing field these
artists entertain, titillate, mesmerise and amuse their European/
European-American admirers. (2002) Pindell, Betye Saar, and other black
artists, curators, and academics who have spoken and written critically
(sometimes negatively and sometimes personally) about stereotypes in
Walker's work and the presentation and reception of Walker, her work,
her writing, and statements about her work, have all too often been
lumped together and summarily dismissed. Should we ignore the set of
power relations on display here and in Pindell's and others' critiques,
that an often uncritical embrace and dissemination of Walker's work
seeks to place her, the work, and the art establishment itself outside
of a particular history of art world inclusion and exclusion and a
broader history of institutionalized racism and white supremacy?≤∑ This
too is the ground of Walker's work. What Walker finds in the form of the
silhouette is, she says, ''a near perfect solution to a complex project
that \[she\] set for \[herself\] to try and uncover the often subtle and
uncom- fortable ways racism, and racist and sexist stereotypes influence
and script our everyday lives'' (quoted in Obrist 1998--99).≤∏ I suggest
that while Walker looks to familiar figures, her work is not simply the
recycling of stereotypes. The forms are identifiable as stereotypical
through naming, through asso- ciation (Topsy, Uncle Tom, Mammy, Eva,
plantation master and mistress, overseer, etc.), through scene and
scenery, but that the figures engage in actions that one can describe
and not name (as Copjec says) and that sometimes one can barely describe
seems to me a step away from the readily assignable roles and postures
of the stereotype and a step toward throwing them into relief against
what they conceal. [Walker's work seems to revel in (and this reveling
is painful to witness) this kind of disfiguration of blackness and
whiteness, in what one reviewer terms ''finely cut nastiness'' (Steffen
2002, 98). **This reveling is coupled with a refusal to disavow the
monstrous pleasures---pleasures that (de- pending on the position from
which one sees the thing) one sees as well in antislavery writings and
visual arts---that Walker depicts in her work, a monstrosity that black
and white viewers alike find themselves, perhaps in different ways,
participants in. This unwilling interpellation into the scenes of
slavery (past and present) is, I think, what has drawn the ire of a
number of (art) critics and academics: their confrontation with their
participation in the scene, through recognition, denial, identification,
and through collapsing horror and pleasure, humor and
pain.**]{.underline} Once Copjec describes Walker's black and white
figures, as she begins to read the violent scenes that Walker stages
among them, her description shifts, like that of many critics, to one in
which all of the human characters are, for all intents and purposes,
diegetically or otherwise black.≤π Black and white viewers alike erase
the white black figures. But if we accept, as I think we must, that part
of what Walker's work takes on is the transmission and effects of
profound interracial (sexual) violence (as well as intraracial violence)
in, for example, The End of Uncle Tom and the Grand Allegorical Tableau
of Eva in Heaven, from which the vignette of the four women/girls is
drawn, how are we to read these scenes as scenes of slavery (and its
traumatic return) without those white characters who are its primary
agents (master, mistress, young master, young mistress) and their agents
(driver, overseer)? [The very ways that we see, and following from the
visual cues the critical conversations that we have about Walker's
shadows and their acts, at first inclusive of actors who are white and
black, are projected onto and then become internal to those black black
figures who thereafter appear to be fucking, fighting, shitting, eating,
and otherwise violating and sometimes pleasuring each other and
themselves all to them- selves. To erase the white characters is to
repress and then to repeat the profound national, visual, and rhetorical
violence that Walker's allegories of slavery attempt to make visible.
The subject (black and white) doing the erasing (of self and other) is
unable to see that erasure as the site of slavery's traumatic
insistence. Without the white characters we see non- chalance and not
horror in these black performances; without the white characters and
with no memory of the conditions under which such acts are compelled,
the excessive sex and violence that we see might well be described as
that phenomenon called ''black-on-black crime.'']{.underline} When
Copjec, Robert Hobbs, and others write about the ''racist memo- rabilia
or Americana that Walker, like many other blacks, admits to collect-
ing,'' the focus on black collecting appears to me to be another
instance in which Euro-American post-slavery subjects erase the scene of
their own production through profound violence. That is, (white) critics
who, on the one hand, locate the emergence of Walker's images as
coincident with the increased numbers of black people (what Hobbs calls
''upscale African Americans'') collecting racist memorabilia, on the
other hand do not mention the fact that the majority of such objects not
only circulate among and are owned by, but are produced by, nonblacks,
principally whites, of all classes.≤∫ But what is it in Walker's work
and its circulation that produces such visceral responses, such
passionate refusals, from some black viewers who may or may not collect
racist memorabilia?≤Ω Might this discomfort point to their awareness of
the conditions of ''freedom within unfreedom'' in which we live now,
present conditions that are coincident with and struc- tured by the past
that is not yet past? Walker's work, along with the work of Michael Ray
Charles, Beverly McIver, Fred Wilson, Robert Colescott, Carrie Mae
Weems, and Josephine Tarry (in conjunction with Bradley McCallum), among
others, is another instance of the return of an African American
repressed in the form of an exploration of black blackface min- strelsy.
Is it a discomfort related to the very unspeakability of the conditions
that are still compelling such black performances? While I do not
explore this here, it's worth repeating Michele Wallace's caution: ''The
case of extensive black participation in blackface minstrelsy needs to
be accepted and interrogated since it means, it seems to me, that there
are crucial aspects to the form that have somehow been overlooked in the
haste to condemn it as hopelessly racist, and to erase all memory of
it'' (2000, 145). I return to Copjec, who slips too easily into
stereotype, dismissal, and disavowal (her language of a ''downtrodden
but spirited people,'' ''self- sacrificing and virtuous blacks,'' etc).
This easy slippage, this spatiotem- poral erasure of whites from the
scene of slavery, its excesses, and the persistence of its traces in the
present may be part of what makes those whom Copjec identifies simply as
Kara Walker's black ''protesters'' so upset with the art establishment's
embrace of Walker and her narrative cutouts. Copjec's look at the black
critics' reading of Walker's work repeats the gesture of erasure, like
the one that erases whites from the scene of producing slavery and from
producing and collecting racist memorabilia. It erases the ways that
Walker's work circulates among, adorns the walls of, and is in
conversation most often with the (largely white and largely nonblack)
art establishment (buyers, curators, gallery owners, collectors, art
historians). Given the general agreement that Walker's images are
allegories of profound violence in slavery and in the present, there is
significantly less attention given to the ways these images traffic in
dif- ferent spaces and produce a variety of responses (not to mention
subjects) precisely as an effect of the blankness of the silhouette
form. Walker's cutouts and the narrative pieces that sometimes accompany
them appear for a number of her critics to be too loose, too unframed,
and too close to minstrelsy.≥≠ That in her work and in her statements
about her work Walker quite openly references ante- and postbellum
images, image mak- ing, and viewing practices does not mitigate this
view. For example, in [Walker's frequent focus on the conjunction of
horror and pleasure I see traces of François-Auguste Biard's antislavery
painting Slaves on the West Coast of Africa (1833). One of the scenes
from Slaves that was frequently reproduced by abolitionists and
pro-slavery advocates alike depicts a black woman being branded by a
French sailor. **We see in this image, its repro- duction, and
circulation the meeting of libidinal philanthropic and sadistic
investments. While Walker acknowledges her indebtedness to the long and
very problematic traditions of minstrelsy and the Tom show, her cutouts
are, I would argue, not simply or merely her ''cutting-up.''** They are
not, or at least not simply, Walker being an art world opportunist or
the product of art world hype. Connected as they are to minstrelsy these
silhouetted vignettes should, indeed must tell us something about the
inter- and intraracial relations that minstrel shows, their antecedents,
and progeny reflect and produce. So while Walker's disturbing allegories
of the ante- bellum United States seem to some critics to be minstrel
show capering and to others a ''cakewalk,'' I suggest that they are an
uncanny sideways look (her black-eyed squint, what she calls an
unreliable look) at slavery that ruptures history.]{.underline} It is
just such attention to the look and what it reveals that brings me to
''Kara Walker's Cakewalk,'' the art historian Donald Kuspit's vitriolic
re- view of Kara Walker: Excavated from the Black Heart of a Negress
(2003). Kuspit writes: Kara Walker's wall works are a kind of
cakewalk---''a musical promenade of black American origin with the prize
of a cake awarded to couples who demonstrated the most intricate or
imaginative dance figures and steps,'' ac- cording to the dictionary.
They certainly take the cake for imaginative bril- liance and strutting
wit, but what's the ideological point, beyond the fancy art footwork,
for doing a cakewalk these days? The civil rights surge of the 1960s has
passed into history. Prejudice remains---against Asians, Jews, women and
gays as well as blacks---and, these days, perhaps most of all against
heterosexual white males, but there's no special pleading on their
behalf.≥≤ Kuspit asks, ''What is the ideological point, beyond the fancy
art footwork, for doing a cakewalk these days?'' The cakewalk being his
own trope for Walker's work, Kuspit posits the black American origin of
the trope, then relies for an answer on a definition of the cakewalk
that rhetorically erases the conditions of this black American art
form's production and the dif- ferent audiences for whom this
performance is staged. He attempts to completely erase Walker's point as
he turns this history into a cakewalk that posits white heterosexual
males as its final and actual victims, victims for whom there is no
appeal. During slavery cakewalks were dances that were encouraged,
supported, or compelled by the master; they were also sites of
recuperation, sites where enslaved people could access some plea- sure
that enabled survival within slavery, sites from where the enslaved
could stage some resistance, and also sites from where the master could
sustain the ''consent'' of the enslaved to their lot.≥≥ \[The\] Cakewalk
developed as a pastiche of the dance slaves witnessed their white
masters and mistresses performing in the Big House. Certain meanings
were encoded and although apparent to those in the know (the slaves),
were read differently by white people who had the slaves perform this
dance for them. For these spectators, the Cakewalk was an amusing
attempt at sophis- tication on the parts of their slaves, rather than a
mockery of their lifestyle. . . . ''They \[the enslaved people\] did a
take-off on the high manners of the white folks in the 'big house,' but
their masters who gathered around to watch the fun, missed the point.''
(George-Graves 2000, 60) Calling Walker's work a cakewalk thus turns our
attention to the gaze to highlight Kuspit's, and a larger audience's,
desire to see a particular ''black performance'' rendered transparent.≥∂
Missing the point, or perhaps get- ting it and erasing the evidence of
that understanding, Kuspit continues: ''The installation as a whole is a
kind of pastiche spectacle---a theater of the absurd, in which the
spectator, standing in the center, is assaulted by a buckshot of texts
and overwhelmed by the big screen-size image. The change in scale,
medium and import is disorienting, adding to the sense of victimization:
one is forced to identify with blacks---forced into their position''
(2003; emphasis mine). Kuspit's entirely symptomatic (mis)reading of
Walker's work seems to arise from this crucially accurate reading of a
forced identification with blackness (this blackness and these blacks)
that this spectator (any spectator) may experience as profound,
disorienting violence (''assaulted by a buckshot of texts,''
''overwhelmed by the big- screen image''). Kuspit's complaint stems from
the fact that Walker's work works all too well. On the one hand he is
correct: one is in a position of reading ''white through black'' and
thus in the position of an identification of sorts with blackness, if
not with black people. On the other hand the diegetically black
characters do not provide the only point of entry into the scene.≥∑
Forced to identify with these blacks,≥∏ forced into ''their posi-
tion,'' what Kuspit experiences, and I suspect an audience of both black
and white viewers may experience, is a too close association with a
''fuligi- nous'' blackness that must immediately be met with a violent
disavowal. There are, of course, other disavowals here as well: Kuspit's
admitted horror at being forced to identify with the black characters in
the vignettes serves to protect him from acknowledging his forced
identification with the white ones, and, for some black as well as white
spectators, an unwill- ing identification with disfigured blackness.≥π
For Kuspit this work is an ''ideological failure'' because in spite of
being assaulted by blackness he ''experienced no pity and terror---no
catharsis despite the stressful drama---nor did \[he\] feel particularly
enlightened with new insights into the situation or mentality of black
America, if there is any single situation or frame of mind that defines
it (doubtful)'' (Kuspit 2003). But Kuspit does feel the terror of
identification, and the anxiety that arises in his work is all about the
power of signification. Certainly the work is successful at revealing
Kuspit's ideology: ''Prejudice remains . . . perhaps most of all against
heterosexual white males, but there's no special plead- ing on their
behalf'' (2003). His response to his unsettling interpellation into the
scene of slavery and its incarnations in the present seems to me not
indicative of the ideological failure of Walker's work but of its
ideologi- cal and artistic success. He continues: Walker's work is
certainly high drama, weirdly tragicomic, with a deft narrative twist,
but it has less to do with social reality than black rage, resentment
and bitterness. The mural suggests a futile attempt---or is it a
deliberate refusal?---to come to terms with past history, suggesting
that there is a regressive dimension to the sense of being a victim.
Walker seems obsessed with the past, as though to preclude a vision of
the future, perhaps because it is a generalized American future rather
than a specifically black one. Is she holding on to black difference in
defiant fear of American sameness (which is more of a myth than
reality)? Kuspit, it seems, reads this backwards, for there is no myth
of ''American sameness'' without black difference. Once again we have
black-on-black crime, this time a drive-by shooting. This rhetorical
move repeats what I identify as the white critics' anxiety when
confronted by Walker's cutouts: it exposes a desire to put black and
white back in their ''proper'' places. Kuspit then proceeds to buttress
his argument by inserting a quotation from Adorno on jazz, without
mentioning that it is a notoriously prob- lematic (mis)reading. Despite
possessing some technical brilliance, for Kuspit Walker's work,
''however artistically eloquent, remains haunted by T. W. Adorno's
dialectical view of the jazz performer'': It is well known that jazz is
characterized by its syncopated rhythm, thus by a displacement which
inserts apparent beats within the regular measures, com- parable to the
intentionally clumsy stumbling of the eccentric clown, familiar enough
from the American film comedies. A helpless, powerless subject is
presented, one that is ridiculous in his expressive impulses. Now the
formula of jazz is this, that precisely by virtue of his weakness and
helplessness this subject represented by the irregular rhythms adapts
himself to the regularity of the total process, and because he, so to
speak, confesses his own impotence, he is accepted into the collective
and rewarded by it. Jazz projects the schema of identification: in
return for the individual erasing himself and acknowledging his own
nullity, he can vicariously take part in the power and the glory of the
collective to which he is bound by this spell. (Adorno, ''Sociology of
Art and Music,'' quoted in Kuspit, 2003) Kuspit allows himself to
maintain his blindness by projecting it onto Walker and her work and by
repeating without qualification Adorno's reading of jazz, which is
structured by a similar blindness. Indeed might we not read in Walker's
vignette of the four suckling figures, her ''big black mammy'' as ''the
embodiment of history,'' precisely the means by which the (white)
individual erases himself or herself so that he or she can take part in
''the power and the glory of the collective'' (Kuspit 2003)? Perhaps
part of the cause of Kuspit's discomfort (his argument is repre-
sentative in its symptoms) lies in Walker's explanation about her choice
of the silhouette form that spoke to her ''in the same way that the
minstrel show does---it's middle class white people rendering themselves
black, making themselves somewhat invisible, or taking on an alternate
identity because of the anonymity. . . . You can play out different
roles when you're rendered black, or halfway invisible'' (1999). Not
black people's self- erasure or white people ''blacking up,'' but white
people making them- selves white through a rewriting of the one-drop
rule (in which a little blackness makes you whiter). Of course in
Walker's work there is an intraracial conversation going on as well as
an interracial one, but many critics would have us believe that it is
wholly intraracial, that what Walker depicts is all and only about
black, or constructively black, people, as if race, slavery, and racist
memorabilia are of relevance predominantly, if not exclusively, to the
African American post- slavery subject as the one who wears the shadow
of the ''blood-stained gate.'' Let's review Copjec's list of characters
in Walker's work: ''pickanin- nies,'' ''Hottentot harlots, sambos,
mandingos, Uncle Toms, churls and scal- lywags,'' black folk all of
them, with the exception of the scallywag,≥∫ a white figure outside of
whiteness, a ''nigger-lover,'' a white person who is seen by white
people through a lens of derision to be counted with black people,
blackened, an example of unassimilated whiteness. Each term signals a
slippage that on the one hand acknowledges and on the other hand
repudiates Kara Walker's ''ironic and giddy, half-vulgar attempt . . .
to suggest that everything is akin to blackness'' (Hobbs 2001, 81). Put
another way, Copjec's slip indicates that she uncannily misses Walker's
point of rendering everything black, and yet her elision makes both her
own point and Walker's point all too well: that black bodies are
''bodies occupied, emptied and occupied'' (Brand 2001, 38) and that too
close association with blackness produces uncanny effects; on the one
hand it makes white- ness unreadable, and on the other hand it makes
whiteness more readable. It is not that '' 'blackness' is only visible
in and against the 'whiteness' of its containing ground'' (Wagner 2003,
96). Rather, reversing the title of Rob- ert Hobbs's and Michael
Corris's discussion of Walker's work (''Reading Black from White''), is
it possible to read white from black? Is it possible, given the history
of the United States, to read whiteness any other way? Indeed, Walker's
furious cuts refuse to disavow that everything (every- one) is kin,
family to blackness, not reducible to the black black figures on the
wall except through eliding the ''diegetically white folk'' with the
white wall against which it is only blackness that becomes visible.
Conflating the white black figures with the black black figures is part
of the process of reading Walker's work, and the collapse of one into
the other is, I think, an indication of the interior limit of
post-slavery Euro-American subjectivity. For the white post-slavery
subject the black figure, and in this instance the ''big black mammy of
the antebellum south,'' that bearer of abject subjec- tivity, is always
seen to be on the outside, constitutive of difference, not internal to
subjectivity, always the not me.≥Ω Copjec writes in ''Moses the Egyptian
and the Big Black Mammy of the Antebellum South: Freud (with Kara
Walker) on Race and History,'' ''Freud removed his notion of race from
this problematic of identification; he stripped it of ideality. In the
process he uncovered an anonymous root of racial identity, in a useless,
exorbitant pleasure'' (2002, 106--7). Walker's work connects this
jouissance, this inaccessible kernel, to the more man- ifest version
that Françoise Vergès articulates in relation to slavery. For Vergès
slavery tells us something about the master's exorbitant pleasure: ''The
forms of domination instituted by slavery constituted new ways of being
whose exploration might open up interesting perspectives upon the
jouissance of power and violence'' (1999a, 3). I would argue, however,
in ex- tending Copjec's link to Walker and to the mammy as the
embodiment of U.S. history, that the exorbitant pleasure that one
locates in relation to the mammy is not entirely exorbitant and
certainly is not useless.∂≠ The mammy (as the embodiment of U.S.
history) is often recuperated fully within the scope of the law, called
up to perform a multitude of functions. The pleasure identified with her
is still useful, like the pleasure Copjec identifies in relation to the
construction of the Aryan ideological ''machine-body,'' and it is, I
think, an example of usufructus.∂∞ [The mammy in all of her incarnations
is useful. On the level of direct signification she stands for domestic
usefulness. We might see as well the uses to which she has been and is
put in countless commercial applica- tions, from the extracted labor of
black women in white households to the (melo)dramatic ideological appeal
of the loving mammy in slavery that covers over legal and other
violence, to the versatile marketing appeal of Aunt Jemima on a box of
pancake mix. Mammy is so pervasive because she is useful in so many ways
in maintaining, justifying, and euphemizing social subjugation. Copjec,
in focusing on an exorbitant, nonrecuperable pleasure (jouissance) that
pertains in these relations, overlooks the mate- rial and social
pleasures of use and profit. Nonetheless her point about jouissance is
valid, for there are ''no limits, no borders to the kind of pleasure, of
jouissance, that \[the enslaved persons'\] owners were seeking. It went
beyond a desire for economic benefit, beyond a desire to be served. The
unnecessary excesses of violence testified to the obscene quality of
enjoyment experienced by the masters. . . . \[This was\] a world in
which beating, violence, was addictive, in which terror was the order of
things. Yet it would be wrong to think that it was exceptional
behaviour'' (Vergès 1999a, 5). There is an unmetabolized terror and
pleasure (though not necessarily for the same subjects) in Walker's
silhouettes that haunts and constitutes the post-slavery subject; its
excesses circulate still]{.underline}. What is so effective about
Walker's work is that she opens up those monstrous excesses. Isn't it
this effectiveness that drives Kuspit's excessive denial? The more
Kuspit denies, the more it becomes apparent that his humiliation is the
same humiliation that at once stimulates Rose's symp- tom and also
''requires'' that she repress it. Copjec concludes with the following
about Walker's work: Allowing her work to be haunted by the traumatic
event of the antebellum past, that is, by an event that neither she nor
any other black American ever lived but that is repeatedly encountered
in the uncanny moment, she opens the possibility of conceiving racial
identity as repeated self-difference. What she shares with all the other
members of her race is not simply a number of common experiences but
this impossible-to-experience event that keeps tear- ing them apart from
themselves, a historical rupture that cannot be ''metabo- lized,'' but
keeps depositing itself in those little piles of shit that turn up
everywhere in the Walker silhouettes. (2002, 107; figure 18; emphasis
mine) Here Copjec succeeds in completely erasing the white black figures
in Walker's cutouts, making it all, once again, about black people. If
Walker's work is, like Freud's Moses, ''stripped of identification'' it
is for Copjec only so for black people. This erasure, this inability to
see herself in the mammy, allows Copjec to miss her own point: that this
figure is the ''anonymous root'' of ''racial subjectivity.'' That is, it
is not just Walker and ''the other members of her race'' who share in
this ''impossible-to-experi- ence event,'' but also the white viewers
who white themselves out of the scenes, out of any relationship to a
common past. There is an excess in Walker's work to which critics and
viewers react variously: Saar and Pin- dell see the work as succumbing
to the past, as playing in slavery (playing the slave) for the white art
world and not as a performance for some other end; Copjec, in the end,
erases whites from the scenes and symptoms of (post) slavery; Kuspit
both denies any implication in the scene and re- emphasizes all the
other repressions; and the (white) art patron, as we will read, cleans
up all the shit. [**The insistence that race equals black and that
black, and not white, equals slavery means that one New York art patron
can, ''for her children's sake,'' censor ''the scatological content of
Kara Walker's mural Worlds Exposition'' (Vogue 2003, 481) (figure
19).**∂**≤ Without the little piles of shit, points of entry into
Walker's ''nursery rhyme raunchy'' vignettes that a child might indeed
latch onto, what remains are any number of disturbing scenes: a black
woman painting a tree from which she is hanging by her tail as she
defecates (shit excised but mouth still open to receive) into the open
mouth of a black child impaled on a white man/statue;**∂**≥ a black
child about to penetrate with a stick a white/black woman whose legs are
hooked over the tree branch that she hangs upside down from as she drops
bananas to a black man down on one knee below her; a white/black child
sucking on the breast of a topless black woman who wears what looks like
a grass skirt. The art patron's erasure of the shit, for the sake of her
children, seems to be the same kind of erasure that, again, allows
Copjec to miss her own point in reading Walker's ''Big Black Mammy of
the Antebellum South**]{.underline}.''∂∂ [Nonetheless Walker's work
succeeds in catching up all of her critics. If old man Corregidora is
positioned as the father of them all, in Walker's work the figure of the
mammy is the ''anonymous root'' of ''racial subjectivity.'' And just as
Freud insisted on the universality of psychoanalysis (it was not, he
maintained, a Jewish science), so do I read Walker's positioning of her
big black mammy, her ''anonymous root,'' as the mother, the ''mythic
source'' of all U.S./American post-slavery subjects.]{.underline}

#### Sovereignty projects an imagined wholenesss of the national body onto an idealized past- this creates an object of desire that is unable to be fulfilled but the promise of fulfillment is invested in each action of the state- a desire for a utopic nation free of a threatening Other that sustains the fantasy of loss reinvests in death driven politics.

Second, [the **subject misrecognises**]{.underline} what objet a is. As
[the object of desire]{.underline}, it is any particular [desired
object]{.underline}, from the strawberry cake to sovereignty. But is
[also the cause of desire]{.underline}, the [engine that keeps the
subject desiring]{.underline}, hence for our purposes in this Special
Issue, that **[which sustains its capacity to act]{.underline}** in the
world. [The subject wants this]{.underline} 'a', [but]{.underline} she
[also wants to be able to keep wanting]{.underline} many an 'a', and she
wants this 'a' to nurture this wanting. This [entails not
being]{.underline} completely [satisfied]{.underline}, or not being
satisfied once and for all. Hence [unsatisfaction is an inherent part of
the mechanics of desire.]{.underline} But this is not all. A crucial
twist is that, by virtue of that it can designate every object of the
subject's pursuits, 'a' points to something that is not there. Here is
the negative, again. Objet a is a 'hole in reality', a 'point of
impossibility' that these objects -- a piece of cake, a sexual partner,
money, sovereignty -- come to fill temporarily.120 It is where the
subject comes up against the negative most intimately. **[Misrecognition
holds up the entire edifice]{.underline}**. [Fantasy turns on the
subject seeing only the particular object 'a']{.underline} (partner,
cake or ... sovereignty[), not the hole it is designed to
fill.]{.underline} The [subject's experience is of a
missing]{.underline}; of something of herself that was
[lost]{.underline} somewhere [in the]{.underline} nether regions of her
[past]{.underline}. This sense of loss is expressed, even, by the 'I
miss you' of the everyday language of love. But the 'I miss you' also
captures something else, namely, objet a's transitivity, the fact that
it simultaneously functions as a lost piece of the subject herself, but
as something that is located in the other. It is that je ne sais quoi
that the other has and that will make me complete. Here is where the 'a'
(rather than the traditional 'x') takes all its meaning: 'a' stand for
autre, 'other', or rather Autre, 'Other'. It is [that missing piece that
connects]{.underline} me [to the]{.underline} other, in the case of the
lover, but also to the [big Other]{.underline}, [the symbolic
order]{.underline}. It is also wh[ere the subject's (mis)recognition of
its desire, and its desire for recognition interconnect]{.underline}.
'The original question of desire' as Žižek puts it,121 is not directly
'What do I want?' but rather 'What do others want from me? What do they
see in me? What am I to others?' Desire is always ultimately, for Lacan,
directed at the other's desire -- at, say, the parent's ravishment. In
sum, [object a is]{.underline} thus [that missing piece of itself that
the subject pursues in order to reclaim something from the original
loss]{.underline}/repression that marked her entry into the symbolic
order, her socialisation, and that, in actual fact, designates what can
qualify for her as something she desires, according to the terms of its
idiosyncratic fantasy. This is the circle that runs from the object of
desire to the broader fantasy, now understood as the generative
structure that affords the individual the grammar with which she pursues
her desire in the world. To work, the circle must not be broken. It is
precisely what the psychoanalysitic practice seeks to interrupt.
**[Fantasy is a structured impossibility]{.underline}**; and what it
structures is desire, but not in such a way that it attains the object
it has designated for it, but rather, such that it cannot. Hence it is
[a]{.underline} 'formal [symbolic structure']{.underline} [centred upon
an impossibility]{.underline}.122 What is more, object a, the ultimate
negative, or nonbeing structuring the human experience, is also what
confers the subject its consistency, its sense of being. Though
[desire]{.underline}: [shifts from one object to the other]{.underline},
through all these displacements ... desire nonetheless [retains a
minimum of formal consistency, a set of phantasmatic
features]{.underline} [which]{.underline}, when they are encountered in
a positive object, [makes us desire this object]{.underline} -- objet a
as the cause of desire is nothing other than this formal frame of
consistency.123 Sovereignty as fantasy We are now in the position to
revisit our earlier notion of fantasies of sovereignty. Or rather, with
Lacan, we can now consider how **[sovereignty functions as a
fantasy]{.underline}**, that is, as [a compensatory structure by
which]{.underline} international [actors]{.underline} -- states, but
also 'wannabe' states -- [chase after an imaginary 'wholeness' projected
onto an idealised past]{.underline}; and that this [chasing after is a
key driver of international politics]{.underline}. Just as Lacan's
formula illuminates the subject pursuing a succession of objets a, so
[sovereignty]{.underline} [reveals a]{.underline} similar, collective
hence political, [structure of action underwriting the international
system]{.underline}. **[Sovereignty affords a 'generative grammar' by
which a state identifies its objets a]{.underline}**, those [specific
undertakings that will restore it that which it has 'lost' and
'requires']{.underline} (by the terms of this compensatory script) [to
recover in order to return to its former grandeur]{.underline}.124 Objet
a is a placeholder. It may be piece of territory (Crimea, for Russia), a
technology, or a weapon: [it is whatever a particular state has invested
to assert an undisputable sovereignty,]{.underline} **[one that cannot
fail]{.underline}** to be recognised by other states, even if they are
reluctant to grant such recognition. The purchase of apprehending
sovereignty in these terms is, first, that the specific 'object' charged
with achieving this purpose (and that is desired for that reason) is
determined by a given state's history. Moreover, this past grandeur is
always necessarily, structurally, imaginary; regardless of how actually
powerful the state in question is or has been; even for the most
powerful state setting out to 'Make America Great Again.' [What it taps
into is an imaginary wholeness]{.underline}, the [fantasy of a lost
unity that is lodged at the individual level]{.underline}. Second, to
understand that it is imaginary is to understand exactly where the
promise lands, regardless of the prospects of its realisation. The
promise works when it reactivates, for every supporter, a deep-seated,
nostalgic, and perhaps ultimately unshakeable aspiration to restoring a
foregone imaginary oneness of the self, which constitutes an important
motivation for us doing the things we do. This affords tools for
apprehending the enduring appeal, not of 'populism' (per a recently
popular term), but, I suggest, of sovereignty itself.

The political is thus revealed, not in what we call political activity,
but in the double movement whereby the mode of [institution of society
appears and is obscured]{.underline}. It appears in the sense that [the
process whereby society is ordered and unified across its divisions
becomes visible. It is obscured in the sense that the locus of politics
(the locus in which parties compete and in which a general agency of
power takes shape and is reproduced) becomes defined as particular,
while the principle which generates the overall configuration is
concealed.]{.underline} (Lefort, 1988:11) The point here is that the
[institution of political reality presupposes a certain repression of
the constitutivity of the political.]{.underline} It [entails an
impossible attempt to erase the political ontology]{.underline} [of the
social.]{.underline} In Leforts view, for example, and here he draws
from traditional political philosophy in which what distinguishes one
society from another is its regime, [its shaping of human existence, the
political is related to what generates society, the different forms of
society. It is precisely because the very idea of society contains a
reference to its political definition that it becomes impossible to
localise the political within society.]{.underline} **[The political is
thus revealed as the ontological level of the institution of every
particular shaping of the social]{.underline}** (this expression
denoting both giving meaning to social relations and staging them)
(Lefort, 1988:217-19). [When we limit our scope within political reality
we are attempting a certain domestication/spatialisation of the
political, we move our attention from the political]{.underline} per se
(as the moment of the disruption and undecidability governing the
reconstruction of social objectivity including political reality) [to
the social]{.underline} (as the result of this construction and
reconstruction, as the sedimented forms of objectivity) (Laclau,
1990:35). [This sedimentation of political reality]{.underline} (as a
part or a subsystem of the social) **[requires a forgetting of origins,
a forgetting of the contingent force of dislocation which stands at its
foundation; it requires the symbolic and fantasmatic reduction of the
political.]{.underline}** Yet, [to negate the political does not make it
disappear, it only leads to bewilderment in the face of its
manifestations and to impotence in dealing with them]{.underline}
(Mouffe, 1993:140). What constantly emerges in these currents of
contemporary political theory is that the [political seems to acquire a
position parallel to that of the Lacanian real]{.underline}; [one cannot
but be struck by the fact that the political is revealed as a particular
modality of the real.]{.underline} The political becomes one of the
forms in which one encounters the real. The field of [social
construction and political reality is the field in which the
symbolisation of this real is attempted]{.underline}. Chaitin is correct
when asserting that [symbolisation has the creative power to produce
cultural identities, but at a price, the cost of covering over the
fundamental nothingness that forms its foundationit is culture, not
nature, that abhors a vacuum, above all that of its own
contingenc]{.underline}y (Chaitin, 1996:45), of [its ultimate inability
to master and symbolise the impossible real: there is a structural lack
in the symbolic, which means that certain points of the real cant be
symbolised in a definite manner]{.underline}. The unmitigated real
**[provokes anxiety]{.underline}**, and this in turn **[gives rise to
never-ending, defensive, imaginary constructs]{.underline}** (Verhaeghe,
1994:60). Following from this, **[all human productions]{.underline}**
\[Society itself, culture, religion, science\]**[can be understood in
the light of that structural failure of the symbolic in relationship to
the real]{.underline}** (ibid.: 61). It is the **[moment of this
failure, the moment of our encounter with the real,]{.underline}** that
is revealed as the moment of the political par excellence in our reading
of Lacan. It is the **[constitutivity of this moment in Lacanian
psychoanalysis that proves our fantasmatic conception of the
socio-political institution of society as a harmonious totality to be no
more than a mirage]{.underline}**. It is this traumatic moment of the
political qua encounter with the real that initiates again and again a
process of symbolisation, and [initiates the ever-present hegemonic play
between different symbolisations of this real]{.underline}. This **[play
leads to the emergence of politics, to the political institution of a
new social fantas]{.underline}**y (or of many antagonistic fantasies
engaged in a struggle for hegemony) in the place of the dislocated one,
and so on and so forth. In this light[, Lacans insistence on the
centrality of the real, especially in the latter part of his teaching,
acquires major political importance]{.underline}. Lacan himself, in his
seminar on The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis uses noise
and accident as metaphors or examples of our encounter with the real. It
might be possible to add the political to this chain of equivalences.
Lacans schema of **[socio-political life is that of a play, an unending
circular play between possibility and impossibility, between
construction and destruction, representation and failure, articulation
and dislocation, reality and the real, politics and the
political]{.underline}**. It is [this constitutive play
which]{.underline} can help [illuminate a series of political
questions]{.underline} and lead to a novel approach to political
analysis. As an illustration let us examine a concrete problem of
political analysis. How are we, for example, [to account for the
emergence and the hegemonic force of apartheid discourse in South
Africa]{.underline}? Is **[this emergence due to a positively defined
cause]{.underline}** (class struggle, etc.)? What becomes apparent now,
in l**[ight of the structural causality of the political, is that the
reasons for the resurgence of Afrikaner nationalism in the 1930s and
1940s are not to be found in some sort of objective
conditions]{.underline}** (Norval, 1996:51). [Apartheid can be traced
back to the dislocations that conditioned the emergence of this
Afrikaner nationalist discourse]{.underline} (associated, among others,
with the increasing capitalisation of agriculture, the rate of
urbanisation and events such as the Great War). [The articulation of a
new political discourse can only make sense against the background of
the dislocation of the preceding socio-political order or ideological
space]{.underline}. It is **[the lack created by dislocation that causes
the desire for a new discursive articulation]{.underline}**. It is this
lack created by a dislocation of the social which forms the kernel of
the political as an encounter with the Lacanian real. **[Every
dislocatory event leads to the antagonistic articulation of different
discourses that attempt to symbolise its traumatic nature, to suture the
lack it creates.]{.underline}** In that sense [the political stands at
the root of politics, dislocation at the root of the articulation of a
new sociopolitical order, an encounter with the real moment of the
political at the root of our symbolisation of political
reality]{.underline}.

#### Disabilities relationship to the horror trope allows people with disabilities to build communities that can be used to subvert abled body power structures while simultaneously rejecting notions of becoming whole. 

**Faust 2018** (Ethan Faust. University of Pennsylvania and Cooper
Fellow. Rejecting the Stereotypes: Built into Material Culture:
Disability in Toy Story. 2018. Date Accessed: 7.21.19 ///ONW)

[The horror genre, through its use of the disabled characters as
monsters, has propagated a notion that a disabled life is not one worth
living.]{.underline} Woody, who as the central living toy embodies the
anxieties of society, demonstrates the pervading fear of the disabled in
his use of the term "monster," seemingly having been indoctrinated by
the material culture that has taught him, as it has taught many of the
viewers of the ﬁlm, that disabled equals monstrous. However, after
Woody's anxieties have been revealed, [the ﬁlm repackages the horror
genre to demonstrate the invalidity of those stereotypes]{.underline}.
Ian Olney (2006) is one of the ﬁrst to allow horror to be subversive,
believing "**[horror might serve as a site of resistance to the
ideological status quo"]{.underline}** (p. 295). He develops an approach
where **[viewers of horror can "resist or recast the 'dominant' or
intended meaning of these texts"]{.underline}** (p. 295). [A ﬁlm can
utilize the horror tropes to allow a viewer to recognize the potential
error of the assumed monstrosity of the disabled, revenge-seeking
characters.]{.underline} "Although it has often been a critically
ignored or maligned genre, seen simply as the province of revolting
bodies," he writes, "horror has the capacity to become the home of
bodies in revolt" (p. 302). When the ﬁlm centers its point of view
entirely through Woody, horror serves its typical purpose. [But **when
Toy Story gives its disabled characters signiﬁcant screen time,**
letting Woody have a chance to view them as social beings like any
others, **the genre fulﬁls its rare subversive role. Woody's realization
that the disabled exist in a social community comes
slowly**]{.underline}. Even after he sees they have reattached Buzz's
arm, helping Buzz instead of harming him, he says to the space ranger,
"But they're cannibals. We saw them eat the other toys" (Lasseter,
1994). However, his incredulous response changes when he sees them also
reattach the original head on the doll Sid had maimed earlier. At this
point, [the point of view changes away from the ﬁrst person perspective
common in horror ﬁlms. A slow left to right pan, accompanied by softer
music, reveals **the disabled toys standing together in unison**, this
time in light rather than in shadows.]{.underline} **[This shift ﬁnally
lets viewers see the bodies of the disabled toys as something other than
freaks by decoupling their existence from the horror
genre.]{.underline}** Just as Woody understands his mistake and begins
to apologize, the disabled toys run off as Sid returns. The child's
arrival to reclaim Buzz comes with the return of the chimes and horror
music. But because by this time Sid's horror has been dissociated from
the toys, the return of the horror music afﬁrms that Woody had wrongly
assigned the horror genre to the disabled characters when it should have
gone with Sid all along. [**Armed now with the understanding that the
toys want to rescue Buzz**, who has just been taken by Sid, Woody gives
**the characters** names -- "Pump Boy," "Legs," "Ducky" etc -- and
**begins to see how the unique bodies of each toy can serve a useful
purpose in saving Buzz**.]{.underline} In the subsequent saving of Buzz,
the ﬁlm echoes [Tod Browning's Freaks (1932), an infamous ﬁlm where the
disabled performers in a travelling carnival **revolt against the
non-disabled and invert the power structures**. The toys]{.underline},
with Woody as their leader, **[hide in the mud and sand around Sid's
yard, utilizing their place on the physical margins, where they know
they will be invisible to Sid.]{.underline}** [Just as Browning's
characters emerge from the mud to surround their oppressors, so too do
the disabled toys]{.underline}. In the climactic scene, [the mechanical,
staggering movements of the toys that walk towards Sid serve a useful
purpose.]{.underline} Where the nails driven through the heads of toy
soldiers once signaled brokenness, here they induce fear. [When Woody
breaks the toy code to speak directly to Sid, he speaks in a "one of us"
style designed to scare him. These toys seize the power that has been
denied them]{.underline}. After Sid runs away, Woody turns to the toys
and says, "Coming out of the ground? Nice touch. That was a stroke of
genius" (Lasseter, 1994**[). Toy Story's conscious reference of Freaks
shows how the reclaiming of disability and freakery as a form of power
terriﬁes someone like Sid who has previously not afforded the disabled
toys respect.]{.underline}** [The trope of the revenge-seeking toys
becoming violent towards their oppressor presents problems for
disability studies]{.underline}, [in part because it propagates unwanted
ideas about the disabled being obsessed with the
able-bodied.]{.underline} However, [Toy Story has its disabled toys ﬁght
back in a largely nonviolent fashion, letting Sid go untouched once they
achieve their goal of rescuing Buzz and ﬁnding safety.]{.underline}
Woody, a non-disabled toy, universalizes the anger the toys feel about
Sid, saying, "From now on, you must take good care of your toys. Because
if you don't, we'll ﬁnd out, Sid. We toys can see everything" (Lasseter,
1994). [He highlights that all toys, disabled or not, have a stake in
keeping each other safe.]{.underline} Not only does the ﬁrst ﬁlm
demonstrate and combat stereotypes about disability, but it also
emphasizes that ﬁghting for disability rights should be an endeavor for
everyone.

### 1NC - Link -- Wholeness

#### Expressions of unity of the body, even expressions of the body as broken, represent a form of bodily nostalgia tries to return to the body- a fundamental fantasy that only reinforces the absence of the body

In the chapter "A Skin of One's Own" of Second Skins, Jay Prosser uses
the term "[bodily nostalgia]{.underline}" to describe "the [memory of
the somatotype]{.underline} that should have been" (94). [Following
trauma, illness, or injury]{.underline}, where the body has undergone a
profound alteration, somatic nostalgia manifests as [a desire to
"return]{.underline}", to [bring the body back]{.underline} to a
previous corporeal state/reality. If nostalgia [places the body in the
"precarious position between memory]{.underline} (the lived experience
of the past) and imagination (anticipation of restoring memory's
exigency)" (Bartkuviené 87) then [bodily nostalgia is compounded by the
"memory]{.underline}" [of a]{.underline} former [corporeal
reality]{.underline} and the displacement of the current corporeal
reality by the former. When Elizabeth Grosz speaks of
[phantomization]{.underline} --- often noted as [the feeling of
sensation]{.underline} in an amputated limb --- she describes it as "[an
expression of nostalgia for the unity]{.underline} and wholeness [of the
body]{.underline}, its completion. It is a memorial to the missing limb,
a psychical delegate that stands in its place" (qtd. in Prosser 84).
Phantomization is an "inverse of agnosia" where "the phenomenon of the
phantom limb represents the remembering in the body image of parts
actually lost from the material body" (84). The phantom limb/organ has
been extensively recorded by physicians, although there is still
widespread disagreement to its exact causes9, but Prosser and Grosz
evoke it in their readings to highlight the way phantomization exists as
an articulation of somatic nostalgia; in other words, [phantomization is
the literalization of the grief of the missing]{.underline} limb/organ
which bespeaks the absent body part: "**[a feeling of presence that
remains in its very absence]{.underline}**" (84). Prosser argues that
surgical prosthesis, the process of reconstructing the missing body
part, assuages the ache of somatic nostalgia. Audre Lorde goes as far to
say that "somatic nostalgia" is exacerbated by (and, in many ways, born
from) the emphasis upon surgical prosthesis. In her autopathograhical
text The Cancer Journals, published in 1980, Lorde details her
experiences with breast cancer and partial mastectomy. Following the
discovery of a tumor in her right breast, Lorde writes of the growing
"anger" she felt towards her breast and its "betrayal" of the body:
"...\[It\] is as if it had...become separate from me and had turned
against me by creating this tumor which might be malignant. My beloved
breast had suddenly departed from the rules we had agreed upon to
function all these years" (33). When the tumor's malignancy is
discovered, Lorde is faced with the prospect of a partial mastectomy. On
the day before her mastectomy, Lorde expresses the profound mourning
that accompanies a loss of (and from) the body, writing in a journal
entry: "And yet if I cried for a hundred years I couldn't possibly
express the sorrow I feel right now, the sadness and the loss" (35). The
loss of the breast is totalizing yet Lorde describes her detest of the
way "cosmetic reassurance" is quickly given to post-mastectomy women as
a way to fill that loss: "Any woman who has had a breast removed because
of cancer knows she does not feel the same. But we are allowed no
psychic time or space to examine what our true feelings are, to make
them our own. With quick cosmetic reassurance, we are told that our
feelings are not important, our appearance is all, the sum total of
self" (57). This "cosmetic reassurance" comes in a "blush-pink nylon
envelope with a slighter, darker apex...shaped like a giant
slipper-shell" (44). When Lorde puts it on, she does not feel a sense of
"wholeness" (i.e. that the form is adequately filling in the gap of her
missing breast), rather, the form re-affirms the absence of the breast
that it is trying to replace: "It perched on my chest askew, awkwardly
inert and lifeless, and having nothing to do with any me I could
possibly conceive of" (44). Prosser contends that Lorde's resistance to
the form cannot be divorced "from her initial, visceral psychic refusal
(or failure) to incorporate into body image the cloth prosthesis
immediately on offer" (95) since the "pinkness" of the form materially
emphasizes a racial distance that further alienates Lorde from herself
("...it looked grotesquely pale through the cloth of my bra" (44)). When
Lorde takes the form off, she regards herself as "strange and uneven and
peculiar" yet somehow, all the more herself: "For not even the most
skillful of prosthesis in the world could undo that reality or feel the
way my breast had felt" (44). It is not only that the surgical form, or
the more permanent breast implant, can never return the body to what it
was --- since, arguably, the moment the surgical tool makes contact with
the body is the formation of a new corporeal reality --- but that the
breast prosthesis reinforces the metonymy of breast equals woman. Unlike
dentures or artificial limbs, where "function is the main point of their
existence... \[,\] false breasts are designed for appearance only" (63).
The gaze becomes centralized in the function of breast prostheses where
"the (male) onlooker" is of primary concern: "\[it's about\] how they
look and feel to others, rather than how they to feel to ourselves, and
how we wish to use them" (64). Lorde further highlights prostheses as a
way to silence the affective responses that arise from cancer and
surgery10: "The emphasis upon wearing a prosthesis is a way of avoiding
having women come to terms with their own pain and loss, and thereby,
with their own strength" (49). The breast prosthesis diminishes the
"bodily experience of cancer" (Prosser 94), and "offers the empty
comfort of "Nobody will know the difference"" (Lorde 61). The
"difference", however, is what Lorde argues must be reckoned with, since
the "gap" left by the surgically removed breast is "filled with death --
real death, the fact of it" (53). This encounter with death reanimates,
rather than diminishes, the present --- "... \[it\] heightens and
sharpens...living" -- and Lorde uses it to consider a new way of
reconciling with the post-surgical body: "Breast cancer, with its mortal
awareness, and the amputation, which it entails, can still be a gateway,
however cruelly won, into the tapping and expansion of my own power and
knowing" (53-54). [The act of reckoning]{.underline} with the pain,
grief, and loss of breast cancer and mastectomy, and the [transmutation
of it through language]{.underline} (e.g. journal entries, essays,
etc.), gives Lorde a purposeful way of reckoning with her new corporeal
reality and endows her with a sense of power. It is the [corporeal
reality]{.underline} of the post-surgical body that Lorde argues must
first be dealt with, [rather than supplanting it]{.underline} via the
breast prosthesis [with the nostalgia of]{.underline} (artificially)
[returning the body]{.underline} to what it "once was"; as if cancer
were a thing to be quickly traversed, buried, and forgotten.

#### The abjected body is not refigurable- the fantasy of restoration and unity is a function of fantasy that attempts to render nameable the absent. This desire to return to corporeal reality is a death driven politic that fails to materialize, as the very corporeal reality itself is reasserted when attempt itself reveals the impossibility of the actions of the subject.

In 1994, Lucy Grealy published her seminal memoir, Autobiography of a
Face. In an interview with Charlie Rose shortly after the book's
publication, Grealy described the memoir as primarily "a book about
identity" (1:37-1:39) and the profound feeling of alienation that comes
from "looking different" (2:31-2:32). [The book details her experiences
with cancer (Ewing's sarcoma at age 9 followed by numerous rounds of
chemotherapy and radiation) and the aftermath of (re)construction ---
both of her jaw, which was partially removed as the site of her tumor,
and her "self", which, as Grealy states, would become renegotiated after
the change in her appearanc]{.underline}e. Prosser reads Lorde's The
Cancer Journals and Grealy's Autobiography of a Face as texts that evoke
the "emotional and psychic pain around a body noncoincident with body
image" (93); each writer (to use Prosser's words in reference to
Braidotti) works "toward \[regaining\] integrity" (84) and their texts
evoke a sense of "urgency to reformulate the unity" of the self (qtd. in
Prosser 92). It is the face that Grealy **[attempts to
"refigure]{.underline}**" (to evoke Susan Mintz's essay on the memoir)
--- [textually]{.underline} ([through the act of writing]{.underline}
[and tracing]{.underline} its "autobiography") and surgically (through
reconstructing the jaw). Grealy regards the face as not a synecdoche
that stands in for the self but the total of self: "my face, my 'self'"
(170), she notes in one passage. Mintz contends that through the
conception of the face as self "[Grealy suggests that there is no way to
disentangle the physical from the psychical...She is her body, so far as
we come to know her through text]{.underline}" (173). If the pulse is
what reaffirms one's "alive" status, then [the face is what reaffirms
one's ontological status]{.underline} --- that which one looks to in
order to substantiate one's existence11. In a key passage from the
prologue, Grealy further circumscribes her face as the locus of self:
"T[he singularity of meaning -- I was my face, I was ugliness -- though
sometimes unbearable, also offered a possible point of escape. It became
the launching pad from which to lift off, the one immediately
recognizable place to point to when asked what was wrong with my
life]{.underline}. Everything led to it, everything receded from it ---
my face as personal vanishing point" (7). [Grealy perceives the missing
jaw as "ontological lack]{.underline}" (Mintz 175) and the
[reconstruction]{.underline} of the face [is imbued with "ontic
potential]{.underline}". If Lacanian **[desire is born out of
lack]{.underline}** (Ruti 488), then the "[lack" of the current
corporeal reality manifests the desire for the recognition of
self]{.underline} via the [reconstructed]{.underline} face. [This
desire]{.underline} ([which is always fantasy]{.underline}) is
reminiscent of [somatic nostalgia]{.underline}, since Grealy [expresses
a desire to "return" to]{.underline} her "'original face'" (157), the
[corporeal reality]{.underline} that never was. With the prospect of
surgery, Grealy begins to imagine her "original face" as the real face
and her current disfigured face as the "unreal" face or impostor,
superimposing the "original face" onto her current one: Maybe this
wasn't my actual face at all but the face of some interloper, some ugly
intruder, and my 'real' face, the one I was meant to have all along, was
within reach. I began to imagine my 'original' face...I believed that if
none of this had happened to me, I would have been beautiful. I looked
in the mirror closely and imagined the lower half of my face filled out,
normal. Reaching my hand up, I covered my chin and jaw, and yes, even I
could see that the rest of my face was really beautiful. As soon as I
took my hand away, the ugliness of the lower half cancelled out the
beauty of the upper half, but now this didn't matter so much: it was all
going to be 'fixed'. (157) The somatic nostalgia of the "original face"
is assuaged by the prospect of the upcoming operation --- although the
surgery does not fill the gap of ontological lack but enlarges it.
Prosser argues that "[phantomization renders nameable]{.underline}" (88)
[what is yet to exist]{.underline} and that the process of
[phantomization]{.underline} [is]{.underline} actually [integral to the
"animation]{.underline}" of the surgical prosthesis since "in order to
use a [replacement]{.underline} artificial limb, the amputee needs to
appropriate the prosthesis as his or her own" (85). Grealy "phantomizes"
the "imaginary reconstructed face (which is the "original face") and
posits reconstruction as a way of becoming (and returning to) her
"original" face (88). Hours following the first surgery --- which
involves a graft taken from the groin and attached to the jaw (156) ---
Grealy asks a nurse to "describe" her new face and after the nurse notes
that it is "bruised" and subject to change, Grealy asks for a mirror so
she can see herself. She notes that "'swollen' was an understatement",
to describe her post-surgical face: "This new thing on my face was huge,
almost touching my collarbone. What repulsed me most was a large strip
of foreign skin, much paler than my facial skin, running along the lower
half of my new jaw line. Surrounded by dozens of minute stitches, it
looked just like it was, a patch" (171[). Grealy describes the
postsurgical face as "foreign" and remedies this disconnection through
imagining a future corporeal reality where her real (desired) face
emerges]{.underline}: "I projected my thinking forward to the next
operation, the one that would fix this one" (172). Future operations
bring about similar outcomes: Grealy imagines the surgery as the
formation of/return to self, only to be discouraged when the result is
that her face is "no different from before" (179). The successive "free
flap operations" are also compounded by the arduous nature of grafts and
the reality of necrosis --- cell death of the transplanted tissue. [To
restore the "unity" of the body, the body must become
fragmented]{.underline}; a **[dismembering that is
(re)membering]{.underline}**. Grealy describes one procedure as a "six
to eight hours long" affair that transplants tissues from the hip,
leaving in its wake an unrecognizable site: "...where they had taken the
graft, there was a long row of thirty or forty large metal staples. It
looked as if someone had sawed my leg off and then put it back on with
an office stapler" (197). The [post-reconstructive]{.underline} face is
also [perceived as aberrant,]{.underline} since the graft "had been
applied...from one ear to the next and was obscenely swollen to the size
of a football" (200). The graft, however, is ultimately "reabsorbed,
\[just\] as the last one had been" (204), and Grealy is left with "the
scarred donor site" as the sole somatic remembrance of its existence.
One surgery, a bone graft, gives Grealy a semblance of her "real face".
The bone graft is different from the free-flap since it is
"nonvascularized, meaning a lump of bone would be taken from \[the\]
hip, ground up, and then, like clay, fashioned into the rough shape of a
jaw" (204). The results of the surgery are "immediately apparent and
remarkable" partially due to bone's lack of swelling (204). Grealy
describes the euphoria when she first glimpses at her new face: "I
remember limping out of bed to the bathroom and not believing my own
eyes as I swung open the door. Could that really be me? For weeks
afterward I kept putting my hand up and checking to make sure it was
still there, an actual jaw. For the first time in memory, I actually
looked forward to seeing myself in the mirror, seeing a face I liked"
(204). Although the surgery is successful in its aim of reconstructing
the missing jaw, Grealy does not feel [the sense of fulfillment that
reconstruction was "supposed" to endow]{.underline} --- i.e. the filling
of the ontological lack of self. Was the new face not supposed to bring
with it the dissolution of "fear" and the promise of "love"; "wasn't
life supposed to work now?" (204) When the bone graft begins to reabsorb
in a similar fashion to the previous grafts, Grealy describes it as
"reality...relentlessly manifesting itself again" (208). The
[**ephemerality of the "reconstructed"** face **makes it a kind of
"fantasy" that becomes necroded by the corporeal reality reasserting
itself**]{.underline}. By this time, Grealy is feeling "abject" and
decides to temporarily move to Berlin after graduating from the Iowa
Writers' Workshop. When her sister calls one day to suggest she try "a
new method for plastic surgery" which involves a "tissue
expander...followed by a vascularized bone graft" (214), Grealy feels
"doubtful" and highlights the discernable difference between the reality
of surgical reconstruction and the projected fantasy: "People were
always telling me about the 'wonderful things they can do today.' It was
difficult explaining to them --- even apologizing for the fact --- that
plastic surgery wasn't like the movies. There was never a dramatic
moment when the bandages came off, nor a single procedure that would
make it all right" (214). Although Grealy is aware that the surgery
might prove to be unsuccessful and a return to "familiar
disappointment," she is unable to dissuade its possible success: "...how
could I pass up the possibility that it might work, that at long last I
might finally fix my face, my life, my soul" (215). The tissue graft ---
"an empty balloon...inserted under the skin...and then slowly blown up
by daily injections of a few milliliters of saline solution into a
special port beside \[her\] ear" (215) --- is removed after
complications emerge in surgery, and a bone graft is taken from her hip
and put in its place (she notes that the surgery temporarily affects her
mobility). When the graft starts to shrink, Grealy has another tissue
expander put in, which is successful. Following this surgery, she
describes her inability to reconcile with this "end point" of
reconstruction since the [reformation]{.underline} of the jaw [does not
bring about the desired recognition of self]{.underline}: Something was
wrong: was this the face I had waited through eighteen years and almost
thirty operations? I couldn't make what I saw in the mirror correspond
to the person I thought I was. It wasn't only that I continued to feel
ugly; I simply could not conceive of the image as belonging to me. I had
known this feeling before, but that had been when my face was
'unfinished,' when I still had a large gap where my jaw should have
been...There were still some minor operations, but for the most part it
was over. Was this it? How could this be? Even as people confirmed that
this was now my face, even as people congratulated me, I felt that I was
being mistaken for someone else. The [person in the mirror was an
imposter --- why could anyone else see this?]{.underline} (219-220)
[Since the "real]{.underline} face" [is]{.underline} the [somatic
nostalgia]{.underline} of the "original face" (perpetually contained in
an imaginary past), the **[point of completion illuminates its
inexistence]{.underline}** and, as Sylvia Brown notes, Grealy reaches a
kind of "impasse". Brown contends that "the resistance of her face to
physical stability and the cultural demands for physical perfection
leave \[Grealy\] with a fragmented identity, one that is radically
unfixed even as it is radically overdetermined" (311). The face becomes
an intruder that profoundly separates her from herself. "The insight
that one might treat the body as a signifier capable of multiple
interpretations does not help Grealy either, as alternative viewpoints
either replicate essentializing assumptions about her identity (i.e.,
her fate as monster or outsider) or involve the repression of basic
desires for happiness and love" (311). Grealy's solution to reaching
this point is to disregard her image altogether. She begins to avoid
mirrors and regards her life as containing a kind of emptiness "without
the framework of when my face gets fixed, then I'll start living" (221).
Grealy then experiences a kind of epiphany in a café in Berlin when she
begins to "miss" an innate part of her, "one that had always been there,
organically" (221). The revelation does not bring with it an "eternal"
truth, since, as Grealy notes, "most truths are inherently unretainable"
and that even "the most basic things" must be continuously
rearticulated, reformulated, and re(con)figured (222). It does, however,
illuminate [the tenuous nature of "wholeness]{.underline}" which Grealy
[paradoxically reaffirms through "holding on to]{.underline} at least a
personal [sense of essence]{.underline}" (Brown 314). Although the
ending effectively collapses any essentialist reading of the body by
ending the memoir at a climactic moment where Grealy is just about to
look at her reflection12, Susan Mintz notes that this effectively "keeps
the story of the female body in motion" rather than reaffirming "an
essential femaleness" (qtd. in Brown 314). The end of the memoir
suggests, rather than procures, a reckoning with the corporeal reality;
Grealy is at the precipice, ready to look again and see if she can "now,
recognize \[herself\]" (223). Interestingly, Grealy's
([re]{.underline})[acquaintance with self emerges from the spectral
position of facelessness]{.underline} (when she has abandoned the mirror
entirely). As Sylvia Brown aptly notes in her analysis of Autobiography
of a Face's conclusion: it is "a death (of an old social construction)
and a rebirth (of an identity both new and familiar), an instant of
liminality, as \[Grealy\] poises on the threshold between essence and
construction, fixity and radical openness, repression and confrontation"
(312).

### 1NC -- Link -- Wholeness - Organs

#### The donation of organs creates new kinds of social relationships and relationalities that challenge the figure of the human- the organ is no longer a part of the body, but a quasi-object unto itself that is an independent entity. The transfer of organs, even through commodities, creates a traumatic experience that enables us to re-examine subjectivity and connect with others on a plane of shared vulnerability.

**Andreescu**, Florentina C. \"Opening up Bodies for Harvest: Embodiment
and Global Capitalism.\" Theory & Event 21.2 (**2018**): pp.425-427
//LFP

Besides alterations of the receiver's body and sense of self, Lesley A.
Sharp finds that transferring organs from one body to another generates
new social relationships.107 In cadaveric organ donation, [the donor's
body appears to link the disparate parties involved to one another as
blood/ fictive kin, generating unusual forms of embodied
intimacy.]{.underline}108 She further finds that organ recipients and
donor kin readily incorporate one another as mothers and fathers,
sisters, brothers, and children. The fact that the [donor's flesh
coexists with the recipient's, facilitates the literal reading of this
bond as a "blood" tie]{.underline}.109 One could argue that [accepting
the new organ by endowing it with a genealogy]{.underline}, even if it
is a fictional one, [creates a textual graft between the transplanted
organ and receiver's body]{.underline}.110 This will allow the human
mind to make sense of and integrate as part of self a reorganized hybrid
body. This reaffirms Julia Kristeva's111 argument, which insists that
[the most normal solution to trauma takes the form of
narrative]{.underline}: "Narrative as the recounting of suffering: fear,
disgust, and abjection crying out, they quiet down, concatenated into a
story".112 Here it is instructive to notice that in all the earlier
examples of narratives, [the principles of the reality
of]{.underline}/for [humans]{.underline} (such as the newly formed blood
ties) [are asserted to cover over and discipline an opening to an
abysmal nonhuman world]{.underline}, [in which]{.underline}, instead of
the donor's spirit, [it would be the organ as quasi-object asserting
itself as an independent entity outliving the human body it originated
from]{.underline}. The agency of the quasi-object is attributed instead
to the spirit of the donor, whose spirit is thought to manifest itself
though the various changes the reorganized body experiences. [Organ
transplantation experiences]{.underline} also [remind us that it might
be the enigmatic realm of trauma]{.underline}, of experiences that are
not yet completely grasped, [that allows people to connect across
differences between their cultures and their life-words]{.underline}.
These connections do not rely on what they simply know of one another,
but instead on those uniquely human experiences which assert themselves
as especially mysterious and stubbornly impenetrable by symbolic
frameworks.113 It is through the experience of trauma, which suddenly
and profoundly perturbs one's familiar reality, that one may gain access
to a special mode of knowing and of communicating with others.114 These
[traumatic disruptions of one's ordinary embodied
experience]{.underline}, may [constitute opportunities to acknowledge
the extent to which we]{.underline}, despite our differences, [are
viscerally vulnerable and open to others and to the
world]{.underline}.115 As Judith Butler argues, we are indeed given over
from the start to the world of others, out of which we emerge and assert
ourselves as individualities, which nevertheless intrinsically bear the
others' imprint.116 As such, what initially appeared to be a pure
individuality, at a closer look is rendered to be an impossibility.117
The [complexity of this profound openness and vulnerability of the human
condition, includes organ transplantation as just one facet of the
human-matter-world connection continuum]{.underline}. Rosalyn Diprose's
writings **[address this corporeal human openness and generosity as a
fundamental aspect of human existence]{.underline}**.118
[Generosity]{.underline}, she insists, is being given to others without
deliberation, [a being given that constitutes the self as affective and
being affected]{.underline}, [and that further constitutes social
relations]{.underline}. As such, generosity becomes, in Diprose's words,
"the primordial condition of personal, interpersonal, and communal
existence".119 Jane Bennett especially, encourages [cultivating a stance
of generosity]{.underline}, more specifically [rendering oneself more
open to the surprise of other selves]{.underline} and other bodies and
more willing and able to enter productive assemblages with them.120 The
trust here is that, when **[instead of]{.underline}** disavowing and
**[resisting the openness and vulnerability of the human
condition]{.underline}**, one [embrace]{.underline}s [its intrinsic
unknown]{.underline} and expansive [aspects, one]{.underline} also
[opens oneself up to the possibility of]{.underline} novel and
[surprising modes of authentic existence]{.underline}. Conclusions This
article brought attention to the way human bodies are viscerally
included in global capitalism, namely as body parts that can be bought
for the purpose of organ transplantation. Organ transplantation
technology's success leads to more and more people around the world
being pressured into or choosing to turn towards their own body parts as
resources to be sold in times of economic difficulties. [The organs
without a body as quasi-objects enter a capitalist system]{.underline}
of circulation and gain exchange value. As such [they are perceived as
both alluring, for they can make a defective body whole, as well as
disconcerting.]{.underline} [The opened body offering and receiving
these visceral objects is an uncanny site, and faces us with a traumatic
rupture into our ordinary embodied reality]{.underline}. This is the
case because **[the inclusion of bodies into the capitalist system
coupled with recent discoveries in medical research, lead to cutting
into the idealized image of the body as sacred and whole]{.underline}**,
[and dislocate it into body parts that gain exchange value and enter a
system of commodities.]{.underline} These [cuts into human flesh create
a new reality of dislocated bodies]{.underline}, [or reorganized, hybrid
ones, which]{.underline} indeed [are traumatic to claim as one's
own]{.underline}. One could argue that, [the ontos of the human vanishes
into the fragmented flesh]{.underline}, displaced organs, bits of
bodies, or [various organic as well as inorganic parts, that live on,
manifesting an existence which is no longer tied or owed to the presence
of the human body]{.underline}. In this sense, the **[displaced mobile
organs threaten to annihilate the very meaning and existence of the
subject]{.underline}**, and as such they become horrific entities. The
[kinship narratives, weaved between donors and receivers, are social
responses aimed at suturing the traumatic ruptures of our embodied
reality and accepting the hybrid body as one's own]{.underline}. The
article further engaged with Sharp's121 insight that [human tissues are
hardly seen as detachable and impersonal commodities]{.underline}. These
[quasi-objects, retain, or are invested with, memories of the former
personhood and identity, and their incorporation often has complex
effects on the receiver's embodied identity.]{.underline} [Even though
traded organs, become commodities that should make invisible the body
and subject from which that organ-commodity is produced]{.underline},122
[this is hardly the case]{.underline}. [Instead we observe a complicated
relationship between donors and recipients]{.underline}, which has
impacts immunologically, psychologically, and socially.123 [The donated
organ is perceived as a fragment that partakes in the identity of the
donor]{.underline}. The [material incorporation of the organ involves an
identification with the donor, and a major adjustment of the self's
composition and structure]{.underline}.124 It [further changes our
concept of life and death, and creates new family
dynamics]{.underline},125 or fictive kin relationships.

#### Discourses of the fragmented but restorable are dependent on a fundamental anxiety that constitutes the self, that the sick/disabled body will rupture our wholeness and contaminate us into becoming dependent on the other- this leaves those bodies as the repository for anxieties and the target of violence as we attempt to surpress those anxieties.

\*\*BRACKETED FOR GENDERED LANGUAGE\*\*

Let me begin, then, by developing the psycho-cultural significance of
the Lacanian infant body that displays initially an inherent
dis-integration and frustrated mobility and yet emerges subsequently as
a coherent sexed and sexual subject in the Symbolic. What, then, has
been repressed, or cast aside, in order to achieve that putative unity
and order? More important, which forms of embodied subjectivity cannot
be countenanced, and how might that relate to the disavowed sexuality of
people with disabilities? In opening up this particular line of inquiry,
I do not expect it to resolve the questions I have posed (which are
perhaps not the even the right questions) but rather to suggest ways in
which the "why" of the problematic rather than the "how" of its effects
could be investigated. However any one of us is embodied, the refusal to
countenance what lies beyond the normative, and the consignment of the
sexuality of some people to a dangerous discourse, is an effect of the
parameters that put limits on the sexuality of us all. The task then is
both to retrace the constitution of the normative sexual subject and to
reclaim other modes of sexual becoming. The psychoanalytic narrative
proposed by Freud, and reiterated by Lacan, is deeply disruptive of the
supposed security of the subject in the broadest sense, and more
particularly so in that the inherent excessiveness of sexuality risks
always splintering the imaginary unity of the bounded ego.
[Psychoanalysis lays bare]{.underline}, moreover, [the]{.underline}
intimate [connection between desire and anxiety]{.underline}, which for
Lacan at least are both necessary constituents of the subject. To
characterize desire in terms of lack as Lacan does is, however, by no
means self-evident and it would be instructive to read his schema
against the insistence of Deleuze and Guattari that desire is always
productive and mobile.7 For now, let me review the Lacanian
understanding of how the early infant emerges as a subject. According to
the most familiar formulation outlined in the essay of the same name
(Lacan, 1977a), [the infant]{.underline}---prior to the "mirror
stage"---[experiences]{.underline} ~~himself or herself~~
\[[themselves\]]{.underline} [only]{.underline} as a body in bits and
pieces, [as fragmentary and discontinuous]{.underline} [rather than
whole]{.underline} and integrated (p. 4). It is the experience of what
Lacan calls "le corps morcelé," a body no more or less real than the
conceptually unified corpus that will eventually take its place. What is
undeniable is that [the infant]{.underline}, far from achieving the
self-determining normative standards that characterize adult life, [is
immersed in]{.underline} "motor incapacity and nursling
[dependency]{.underline}" (1977a, p. 2), [a state in which the mother
is]{.underline} an [all-powerful]{.underline} figure, but one not
separable from the infant itself. As is well known, Lacan figures [the
rupture]{.underline} [in the infant-maternal dyad]{.underline} [as
the]{.underline} moment [at which the]{.underline} growing [child comes
to realize a mirrored image]{.underline} of his own body [as whole and
separate and is enabled to disavow]{.underline} or cover over his actual
[incapacity]{.underline} [and disarticulation in the assumption
of]{.underline} what Lacan calls "the armour of [an alienating
identity]{.underline}" (p. 4). Yet that [emergence of an integrated
self]{.underline} is [based from]{.underline} the first on a
[misrecognition]{.underline}, an [identification with an
exteriority]{.underline}, that [serves to inaugurate]{.underline} both
an [imaginary anatomy and a phantasmatic self.]{.underline} Moreover, it
is not simply physical disunity that is [cast aside]{.underline} but
[a]{.underline} [startling series of negative images to
which]{.underline}, Lacan claims, [the infant is exposed in the
imaginary prior to]{.underline} the [illusion of wholeness]{.underline}:
"images of castration, mutilation, dismemberment, dislocation,
evisceration, devouring, bursting open of the body, in short
...**[imagos of the fragmented body]{.underline}**" (1977b, p. 11).
These are surely highly significant, for [they]{.underline} will [remind
us]{.underline} not so much perhaps of the disabled bodies that we
encounter or experience for ourselves day to day, but certainly [of the
socio-cultural fantasies that]{.underline} have always
[surround]{.underline}ed [disability]{.underline}, and particularly in
historical representations of the monstrous (Shildrick, 2002). These are
the **[forms of embodiment that must be suppressed]{.underline}** in
order [for the child to achieve the stability and
distinction]{.underline} [that mark out the normatively embodied
subject]{.underline}. What Lacan's scenario clearly suggests is that
[any body that persists in its manifestation of
dis-integration]{.underline} and disunity--- paradigmatically
[any]{.underline} visibly [disabled body]{.underline}---may [**become
the repository** **of**]{.underline} both corporeal and ontological
**[anxiety]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} phantasmatic sexed and
gendered [subject]{.underline} who emerges in the Symbolic [is
always]{.underline} fissured by its own inaugural méconnaissance, and
deeply [insecure in]{.underline} its apparent [normativity]{.underline}.
Its [hold on order]{.underline}, control, and selfdetermination is
fragile and uncertain, [maintained only by strategies that hold at
bay]{.underline} those [others whose]{.underline} own [corporeality
re-awakens intimations of]{.underline} a fundamental [disorganization
and lack of self-completion]{.underline}. It is here that the western
wariness about, or even aversion to, touch is rooted, for above all
**[the normative subject must avoid the indeterminate physicality of
intercorporeality]{.underline}**. The scopic drive, heralded by the
mirror stage, and remaining dominant throughout life, is the primary
means by which the subject distinguishes itself from its others. But if
the specular interval between self and other serves to protect the
illusion of singularity and corporeal unity, then any point of contact
threatens a loss of differentiation. [Where]{.underline} in addition
[the body of the other cannot be subsumed under]{.underline} the [rubric
of identity to the selfsame]{.underline}, [then]{.underline} its
[putative danger to psychic security is]{.underline} greatly
[accentuated]{.underline}. It may appear overwhelming. [The]{.underline}
enduring [difficulty is that]{.underline} [although the
otherness]{.underline} [of]{.underline} such threatening [corporeal
forms]{.underline} [must be repudiated]{.underline}, [that
otherness]{.underline} [is not]{.underline} simply [external to the
subject but]{.underline} always [recalls the incompletely repressed
experience of infantile dis-organization]{.underline}. [The relation of
the anomalously embodied other to the subject takes on]{.underline} all
the [irresolvable ambiguity of the abject]{.underline}: neither wholly
part of the subject, nor safely outside; disavowed, yet disturbingly
familiar (Kristeva, 1982, Shildrick, 2005). Indeed, Kristeva (1990)
herself makes the links with the Freudian concept of the uncanny as that
which irrupts when it should not appear. Lacan does not speak of the
abject as such, but insofar as he identifies Freud's essay "The Uncanny"
(Freud, 1919) as a grounding text from which to theorize anxiety
(Harari, 2001), the connection is assured. In contradistinction to other
psychoanalytic approaches to the phenomenon, Lacan insists in his
unpublished seminar on anxiety not only that [anxiety]{.underline} is
"not without an object" but that its appearance [signals the
too-closeness of an other who is excessive to representation and who
threatens the symbolic order]{.underline} (Harari, 2001). As Richard
Boothby (1991) puts it: "Inasmuch as it is formed on the basis of a
unifying perceptual Gesalt, the ego is liable to anxiety in fantasies of
the fragmented body, or corps morcelé" (p. 143). [The issue]{.underline}
then [is]{.underline} not that the object of anxiety fails to appear, or
has been lost, as Freud sometimes understands it, but on the contrary
that [what should be lacking is perversely present]{.underline}. Given
that for Lacan, [lack is]{.underline} a necessary [constitutive element
of the symbolic subject]{.underline}, the danger lies precisely in
lacking lack. So what is it that appears? This is how Roberto Harari
(2001) glosses Lacan: "[The object that provokes anxiety]{.underline}
...\[[is]{.underline}\] [the desire of the Other]{.underline}, as the
Other requires that the subject erase its borders, handing itself over
to it in an unconditional manner" (p. 75), and again: "Structurally
speaking, [anxiety]{.underline} ... [suspends the imaginary mapping that
intuitively recognises the difference]{.underline} between an inside and
an outside" (p. 162). In other words, [faced with the reappearance
of]{.underline} its [pre-subjectival phantasies]{.underline} that should
have been banished---[faced]{.underline} in substantive terms [with the
body of disability]{.underline}---[the subject is endangered by the
putative failure of its own boundaries of distinction]{.underline} and
separation. And Lacan (1988) makes it quite clear that the threat of
such disarray and fragmentedness is not some aberration from the normal
experience of the human being but is intrinsic to every one of us (p.
169). Accordingly, **[the trigger that reopens]{.underline}** a
conscious **[experience of anxiety, or]{.underline}** more seriously of
outwardly **[projected hostility]{.underline}**, need be nothing more
extraordinary than [a corporeal encounter with disability]{.underline}.

[I want to write about the body, not as a metaphor, symbol, or
representation, but simply as the body.]{.underline} To write about my
body, our bodies, in all their messy, complicated realities**[. I want
words shaped by my slurring tongue, shaky hands, almost steady breath;
words shaped by the fact that I am a walkie---]{.underline}**someone for
whom a ﬂight of stairs without an accompanying elevator poses no
problem---and by the reality that many of the people I encounter in my
daily life assume I am "mentally retarded." [Words shaped by how my
body---and I certainly mean to include the mind as part of the
body---moves through the world]{.underline}. Sometimes we who are
activists and thinkers forget about our bodies, ignore our bodies, or
reframe our bodies to ﬁt our theories and political strategies. For
several decades now, activists in a variety of social change movements,
ranging from black civil rights to women's liberation, from disability
rights to queer liberation, have said repeatedly that [the problems
faced by any marginalized group of people lie, not in their bodies, but
in the oppression they face.]{.underline} [But in deﬁning the external,
collective, material nature of social injustice as separate from the
body]{.underline}, we have sometimes ended up sidelining the profound
relationships that connect our bodies with who we are and how we
experience oppression**[. Disentangling the body from the problems of
social injustice has served the disability rights movement
well.]{.underline}** The [dominant paradigms of
disability]{.underline}---the medical, charity, supercrip, and moral
models---all [turn disability into problems faced by individual people,
locate those problems in our bodies, and **deﬁne those bodies as
wrong.**]{.underline} [The medical model insists on disability as a
disease or condition that is curable and/or treatable]{.underline}. The
charity model declares disability to be a tragedy, a misfortune, that
must be tempered or erased by generous giving. **[The supercrip model
frames disability as a challenge to overcome and disabled people as
superheroes just for living our daily lives]{.underline}**. The moral
model transforms disability into a sign of moral weakness. Of course,
these differing models intersect and overlap. Take, for instance, Jerry
Lewis and his Labor Day telethon. He raises money by playing to pity and
promising to ﬁnd a cure. This money does not fund wheelchairs, ramps, or
lift bars, nor lawyers to ﬁle disability discrimination lawsuits, but
research for a cure, for a repair of bodies seen as broken, for an end
to disability. Lewis is strategically playing the cards of the medical
model and the charity model. Or think about Christopher Reeve as he
speaks out about the need to ﬁnd a cure for spinal cord injuries and
insists on his ability to overcome quadriplegia, going so far as to air
a Super Bowl ad where, through computer-generated imagery, he is shown
actually getting up out of his wheelchair and walking across a stage.
Reeve creates himself as a supercrip, the superhero now playing himself
offscreen, and is at the same time enmeshed in the medical model. Or
consider mothers with hereditary disabilities, who face signiﬁcant
disapproval for their decisions to have children and immense pressure to
undergo various medical tests and to consider abortion if their fetuses
appear to be disabled. They are caught in a vise-grip between the moral
model and medical model. Whatever the permutations, [these models
unambiguously deﬁne disability and disabled bodies as wrong and bad. In
resistance to this, the disability rights movement has created a new
model of disability, one that places emphasis on how the world treats
disabled people:]{.underline} **[Disability, not deﬁned by our bodies,
but rather by the material and social conditions of ableism; not by the
need to use a wheelchair, but rather by the stairs that have no
accompanying ramp or elevator.]{.underline}** **[Disability activists
ﬁercely declare that it's not our bodies that need
curing]{.underline}**. Rather, it is ableism---disability oppression, as
reﬂected in high unemployment rates, lack of access, gawking,
substandard education, being forced to live in nursing homes and back
rooms, being seen as childlike and asexual---that needs changing.

In the newspaper, [the notion of \'living with\' disability is almost
exclusively drawn upon to reference an individualized
condition]{.underline} (for example, \'there are approximately 200,000
Canadians living with autism\'), characterized as an individual
\'problem\' that seems to require an equally individualized
\'solution\'. This paper presents a contrasting view. **[I begin from an
understanding that disability is not solely or simply in some bodies and
not others, it is always made in the social spaces between
bodies]{.underline}** (Michalko 2002; Titchkosky 2007). [Disability is
always both lived and lived with. In this way, when we are talking about
\'living with\' disability, we are also talking about how disability is
related to and is constituted by a relationship to
non-disability.]{.underline} I should note that [as I draw upon the
terms \'disabled\' and \'non-disabled,\' I am not intending to use them
oppositionally or simply, but rather as designations that are fluid and
relational]{.underline}. [**Disability marks the body in ambiguous
ways** --- it appears and disappears, is noticed and is
hidden]{.underline} --- as we move through different physical and social
spaces, and as we find ourselves in different political and historical
moments. [It\'s also critical to consider how disability marks different
bodies in different and relational ways; systems of ableism come into
contact with racialized bodies, queer bodies, classed bodies, gendered
bodies, **bodies that already have been touched by other** (and perhaps
multiple) systems of oppression.]{.underline} And so, we --- all of us
--- are making sense of this thing called \'disability\' that is many
and shifting, and are endowing it with particular and divergent
meanings. With this in mind, [disability can and must be theorized as an
interactional process --- a \'living-with.\']{.underline} I am choosing
to focus my analysis on Brown\'s series of articles because they are
engaged in narrating Brown\'s (non disabled) life as a life lived in
relation to disability --- a life, literally, with disability. As
[Brown\'s articles narrate his life with disability,]{.underline} they
vividly and, often, poignantly, [tell the story of Brown\'s multifarious
relationship to disability.]{.underline} Brown\'s narrative of \'life
with\' disability tells the story of a father who suffers deeply with
not always being able to comfort his son; a father who struggles with
not being able to communicate with certainty with a son who does not use
words to speak; [a weary parent of a disabled child straddling his
desire that his son might learn to \'fit in\' to a normal world, and his
longing that the normal world might welcome and, even, desire his son**.
Brown\'s narrative also tells of intimate moments of comfort and
connection --- the story of a child nestled into a father\'s side as
they fall asleep together after a long night of crying, a private
language of tongue \'clicks\' shared only between father and son.
Brown\'s articles braid together stories of joy and anguish, connection
and isolation, pride and shame**]{.underline} (Chandler, 2009):

[One way disability is known is by way of the family
relation.]{.underline} Indeed, Brown\'s narrative appears in the context
of an entire genre of literature that tells the story of \'living with\'
disability from the vantage point of the relationally non-disabled
family member. [**The familial relation is** not a simple one; it is
**an embodied relation and as such it is a messy, tangled nexus of love,
hope, grief, anger, disappointment, joy and, always, always more**. We
are ever proximal. We are infinitely distant.]{.underline} Because [this
article grapples with]{.underline} (and is also the product of) [the
paradox of \'living with\' one another, this paper represents the risk
of approaching a critique of Brown\'s articles]{.underline}, without
locating the processes of ableism with Ian Brown, the father, the
person. Brown\'s articles appear in a cultural context that informs us,
in covert and overt ways, that the disabled body represents a deviation
from how bodies (and minds and senses) ought to be. And so, [I search
for a way to attend to how newspaper articles and family stories are
engaged in the making of the meaning of disability, without falling back
on these same systems of moral interpretation.]{.underline} I do this
for several reasons. [Systems of moral interpretation do not bend and
give to fit the complex contours of lived experience. Like disabled
people, parents of disabled people have often been marginalized in the
search for moral clarity.]{.underline} For example, parents of disabled
people --- mothers in particular --- are very often discursively framed
as morally or practically \"culpable\" for the \"tragedy\" of their
child\'s disability and are, therefore, under constant public (and self)
surveillance[. I do not want to reproduce these (inherently ableist)
tactics of moral surveillance by measuring Brown\'s role as a parent in
relation to normative moral standards of how \'good\' parents \'ought to
be\']{.underline}. My critique --- an interpretive critique --- asks
readers to resist our (persistent, seductive, collective) desire for
moral clarity and attend to what Brown\'s narrative --- itself a social,
political action related to but separate from his actions as a parent
--- is already accomplishing. Tanya Titchkosky (2007) writes: \"Texts
appear to people, and with real consequences, texts enter our lives. In
the context of our lives, texts come to life. This life reflects, if
only in a flash, the meaning of the being of that which the text
speaks...\" Following Titchkosky, this paper asks: how is the meaning of
disability and non-disability, already, being made and organized in
Brown\'s text? **[Brown\'s articles attempt to \'answer\' questions like
who is recognized as worthy, who is qualified to \'search for answers,\'
and who is human, by relying on the knowledge he has gained from his
(familial) proximity to disability]{.underline}**. However, as Michel
Foucault (1988), demonstrates, questions of knowledge are also and
always questions of power. [Mechanisms of power are operating on and
through Brown\'s article]{.underline}s --- they were in print on the
front page of a national newspaper for three weeks, are being published
in book form by Random House in the summer of 2009, they are read by
hundreds of thousands of people and are received with almost unanimous
praise. By contrast, \"Walker\" the newspaper headline reminds us,
\"can\'t speak\" \[Brown 2007a, A1\]. [The kinds of stories that
non-disability tells about \'living with\' disability are never neutral.
These stories, as relationally powerful stories, are always involved in
the production and legitimization of conceptions of disability ---
conceptions that are always tied to the materiality of
bodie]{.underline}s. [If **to narrate \'living with\' disability** ---
to speak up, speak out, speak-on-behalf-of --- is one crucial function
of living with others**, it is necessary to trace our speech along the
lines of our** **(power) relations,** **to attend to the ways in which
our words are producing and governing ourselves and
others.**]{.underline} Emmanuel Levinas (1998) reminds us that coming to
[know the other is neither as straightforward nor as simple as Brown\'s
articles seem to sugges]{.underline}t. [Insofar as I am always and
already proximal to the other --- exposed to her gaze, to his touch, to
violence or respect --- the autonomy of the I, Levinas posits, is
fundamentally disrupted.]{.underline} Still, as [I am touched by the
other, as I am so close, so proximal as to be (re)formed in and through
our relation, something still remains distant, inaccessible to
me]{.underline}**.** Levinas reminds us that [in our proximity, there is
also and necessarily a distance; the other is entirely unassumable from
the positionality of the I]{.underline}**. [He reminds us that the other
is proximal to the I only as an excess that always exceeds my ability to
fully know this other (91). It becomes critical to think through (again
and again) the ways in which we are given over beyond the self, and
where this excess of the other, and the other\'s relation to me, exceeds
my ability to know it.]{.underline}**Judith Butler (2004) articulates
this distance or excess that lies between you and I in terms of an
essential \"unknowingness\" (28). She writes: [**\"**I cannot muster the
\'we\' except by finding the ways in which I am tied to \'you\', by
trying to translate but finding that my own language must break up and
yield if I am to know you. You are what I gain through this
disorientation and loss. This is how the human comes into being, again
and again, as that which we have yet to know\"]{.underline} (Butler
2004, 49). The I, Butler tells us, is both constituted and undone by the
other. The \'we,\' then, is revealed to be a tenuous and paradoxical
union. In one way, **[the \'we\' designates homogeneity - a unification
of the same and different; the self-and-other.]{.underline}** Still,
this \'we\' also demarcates heterogeneity. The self. The other. Wholly
separate yet conditionally linked. The \'we\' is a complex tie that both
binds and keeps separate, the same tie that binds and separates
disability and non-disability in Brown\'s narrative. B**[ecause of this
\'excess\' or \'unknowingness\' and because we are always embedded in
relations of power,]{.underline}** Butler argues that there is,
**[therefore, no such thing as a detached or innocent narrator of
relations.]{.underline}** She writes: \"\[T\]he very \'I\' is called
into question by its relation to the Other, a relation that does not
precisely reduce me to speechlessness, but does, nevertheless, clutter
my speech with signs of its undoing\" (Butler 2004, 23). **[As I narrate
the relational ways in which I am intimately close with and connected to
the other, as I draw on a \'we\']{.underline}** (as I do, and I must),
[my words are always bearing witness to this excess. I am marking the
very impossibility of the task of narrating a \'we\'. If to narrate is
one way to render the relationship between the self and the other
knowable, then to narrate is necessarily \"to falter**\"**]{.underline}
(Butler 2004, 23), to be reminded of a looming and inaccessible
\"unknowability\" (Butler 2004, 28).

## 1NC - Alternative

### 1NC -- Alt - Monstrosity

#### The alternative is to impose the figure of monstrosity. To force the confrontation of normativity with queer monstrosity, in other words to "gender-fuck" cis-ness is to resist the consumption of trans bodies by the violent structures that oppose their very existence. Voting negative is an embrace of the the monstrous and an active stance against the erasure that is part and parcel with cisnormativity.

[I am 31; it is May 2011. Life feels fast in this moment, in these
movements. It has been 6 weeks and a day since I began testosterone. I
have been feeling overwhelming joy in this time. I have heard emotional
narratives of other transsexual men and natal females of many genders
who start testosterone. Some feel calmer than before. Some feel
irritable or angsty. Some lose the facility to cry, and with it, the
release crying brings. In these first weeks, I feel an amazing joy. I am
euphoric. I am overjoyed about the changes taking place in my body. The
first day of testosterone treatment, I smell different. My face is oily.
I have so much energy. This exhilarating auto- poiesis, this
self-creation. On the fifth day of testosterone, standing in line to
order dinner in a restaurant, I cannot help but jump up and down.
Frenziness in my chest moves into and through my legs and arms. My mouth
is smiling of its own accord. Muscles are growing, moving parts of me
into a more "male" form. **As parts of my body are looking more "male,"
yet other parts still appear more "female," I am becoming more
monstrous. And my monstrous joy is a powerfully queer
feeling.**]{.underline} A week into my treatment, I run faster and
further, and--- extraordinarily---am not fatigued. I am in multiple
bodies at once. My waifiness as sinewy and wiry is a faggoty mascu-
linity, a boyish femininity. A leaping lizard type of body. [What once
was Tyrannosaurus Rex-like in masculine female form is returning to
become a queerer monster. Hormones moving flesh in my body, shifting
like tectonic plates, pushing fat deposits and muscle densities into new
formations. A slight monster, evolving quickly, into a denser monster.
Becoming new names, so rarely realized. Voicing sounds never before
heard, only almost imagined. Being and becoming many monstrous beasts in
amphibious forms. Every week, a new body, a new beast. Living in two
realms, moving to the next, learning to breathe and locomote in new
ways. We are gaying the drab landscape with our many queer bodies. Isn't
that so joyful?]{.underline} I am going through puberty for the second
time. But this time, I am loving every minute of it. I am ecstatic. What
is this joy about? What does it mean in the context of power structures
of whiteness, patriarchy, and able-bodiedness? Am I becoming more of an
"oppressor"? A distinct discomfort at this thought. A position I want to
move out of more than any other. What does it mean, to be an
"oppressor"? Must an "oppressor" exist, for oppression to exist? Even as
I am becoming, I am the same person I was. I am the same person I was,
so there is no inherent power in any body---it is all created in the
movement of people perceiving me, and I them; this creates the position.
I will now be, in moments, in movements, a recipient of privilege in
ways I was not before. In many ways, it feels to me that the world
around me is changing, more than I am. How is it to be "oppressor" and
yet "oppressed" in the same body, in the same life? What about the
distinct trans oppres- sion that this binary conception of gender
oppression leaves out? It is a distinct experience to feel many sides of
the same oppression, in the same body. Am I becoming oppres- sor in
moments when I am read as oppressor, though noth- ing I am doing is
changing? What, then, is oppression? Is it oppression if a "new"
"oppressor" is not oppressing, and has suffered the very same
oppression? As betweeners, we all are in some ways oppressor, and in
other ways oppressed. Oppression is not bodies themselves, it is the
institutional- ized movement of some bodies against others. Complex
struc- tural forces, not individuals, reproduce oppression. In my
experience, there is more to power than the appearance of a body. Though
I will read more as male, my gender will still be complex. I am a
feminine sort of masculine being. I still have my life history of living
in the world as female, I still have my feminist perspective, and I
still identify with women. As I am aware of male privilege, I still make
efforts to challenge sex- ism and misogyny, just as I always have. So,
using the term "oppressor" for me is inaccurate. I resist oppression in
how I occupy an embodied site of what we would call "oppressor." My
monstrous movement, my life histories, and the histories I inherit queer
oppression even in moments I benefit from it. [However, my Whiteness is
still White. I may queer the concept of oppression by embodying many
parts of it at once, but my Whiteness is compounded by the parts of me
becoming more masculine. I am becoming ever more mon- strous, and yet, I
am also moving into a position of ever more privilege. I have a new kind
of responsibility to hold myself accountable to: the responsibility to
be vigilant about how I move power in the world as someone who is
perceived to be an able-bodied White man, and to move this]{.underline}
power strategically against all forms of oppression and in the service
of allyship to and resistance alongside people of color, disabled
people, women, and other Others. After 6 weeks and a day, I am again and
still, a betweener. I am always a betweener who is becoming. We are all
always becoming, but I am becoming now in a rapid, visible way. People
still stare at me. I am still illegible to them. But I am in love
somehow with my body that is becoming more monstrous and my new
relationalities in the world. A feel- ing of euphoria I have never felt.
Will people still stare at me when I am absorbed back into a sea of
normative-appearing masculinity? When my gender ambiguity becomes less
than it appears? How will I be in the world, if people become able to
see me? I am becoming at once more legible as human, more invisible as
monstrous, and yet I am becoming even more monstrous than before. How
bizarre. How absurd. Though, it is true. My monstrosity is becoming more
visible in the parts of my body that are hidden from view, and less
visible in the more exposed parts. I am becoming more monstrous, and I
can't remember when I have felt this happy. [As I embrace my monstrous
body, my rage births joy. "In this act of magical transformation, I
recognize myself again. I am groundless and boundless movement. I am a
furious flow" (Stryker, 1994, p. 247). I return to myself and reclaim my
power in the monster that I am being and becoming. "Here at last is the
chaos I held at bay. Here at last is my strength. I am not the water---I
am the wave, and rage is the force that moves me" (Stryker, 1994, p.
247). Enraged joy fills my monstrous chest. My beating heart reaches out
beyond my body, spilling out through the wound in my mouth (Weems 2003).
I am being and becoming a being---both human and inhuman. Am I not? I
have come from a turning inward of pain, to a joyful rage of
autonatality, a contentedly calming storm.5]{.underline} New
Legibilities, New Illegibilities, New Inclusions, New Exclusions It is
3.5 months since I began testosterone. I am still 31. I am conducting
research---interviewing trans people about their everyday interactions.
How is my betweenness shift- ing? What is this new betweenness, which
makes me? It is multiple betweennesses. The shift depends on the
interpre- tive eye of the beholder. As my legibility as male (rather
than female or "indiscernible") becomes clearer to others, my legibility
as a person, as human, becomes clearer to oth- ers. I experience people
in a new way. As I walk through the airport, people engage with me,
their eyes reaching out to welcome me: greeting me, invit- ing me,
including me. I stand in line waiting to order a sand- wich. From behind
me, a middle-aged, White woman speaks. Her words smile out from her
mouth like hands to touch me. "What are you going to order?" Her eyes
and face are twinkling, open, soft, engaged. She is smiling at me. Her
entire being is winking at me. I am astonished. Confused. I wonder why
she is talking to me. What does she want? Why is she acting so friendly?
She does not think I am a monster. Then, a dawning thought: She sees me
as a White, able-bodied, cisgendered, straight, male youth. This is the
register in which I am legible to her. The first time in 6 years that I
have felt this privilege of mir- roring; she sees me as one of her kind:
normatively gen- dered. For the first time in my life, I feel how it
feels to be seen as a "normal" male body. This is the shape, the articu-
lation of gender normative, White male privilege. Belonging is what this
configuration of privilege feels like. The energy moving through the
eyes: a way of looking that communi- cates inclusion, camaraderie,
comfort. An ease in the taking of me as one of them. For this moment, my
gender queernesses are unseen. Moving as a gender outcast in the world
for 6 years, I became accustomed to people distancing themselves from
me: staring at me or avoiding eye contact. Belonging: the privilege of
legibility. Legibility does not always mean friendliness, though.
Recognition as male and queer brings another complicated betweenness to
navigate. I walk to the park, holding hands with my then-lover, another
FTM shape-shifter. [A truck bar- rels past us. A passenger yells,
"Faggots!" at us as they pass. I feel a strange mix of excitement and
fear. This is the first time I have felt recognized by a stranger for
who I am: a queer, socially male being. It is exciting to be validated.
It is also the first time I have received this particular form of hate
speech. I feel an acute vulnerability and terror. What an interesting
welcome into this world of masculinities. I am again, a monster, in a
new form.]{.underline} Tensions of power live in between the different
position- alities I inhabit. Though it is precarious, there is a power
in "passing" as male---and as a White male in particular. This iterative
accomplishment of masculinity is a movement that grants me cisgender
male privilege---benefits of the gender power structure. Alternatively,
being seen as a gender-defy- ing male threatens the ideology of
masculinity and this same gender power structure. Masculinity is
inherently fragile because its ideal instantiation is not achievable and
therefore, it is always in need of being accomplished (Kaufman, 2001).
Gender-fucking while being legible as male is a form of resistance
against oppressive gender sys- tems---patriarchy and cisgender
normativity---as it makes the fragility of both masculinity and gender
as we know it visible. Being gender-illegible in this way can claim a
par- ticular power because it disrupts the ideas of gender stabil- ity
and masculinity. However, gender-fucking and "passing" as male are both
precarious; in moments of trans visibility or "discovery," I am
vulnerable to violent gender regula- tions. Thus, I receive particular
forms of power in move- ments when I incite or escape confusion in
others. I also always face risks. What creates vulnerability also
threatens the gender power structure. My betweenness is moving. I am a
multiple betweener. Receiving belongingness privilege when I am seen as
a straight male, the me I have been my whole life up until now is angry
at the me I am today. This old me is still fully me, though others could
not and cannot see. I occupy new illegibilities: the erasure of my
gender complexity and of my history, the erasure of my humanness in my
new, more masculine, queer monstrosity, the erasure of me as myself. I
do not know what to make of these new illegibilities. [They come about
because of cisnormativity, the assumption that people are all cisgender.
Few imagine possibilities for mul- tigendered identities and histories.
Few imagine we might be trans. Being seen as a straight male frustrates
me even as it protects me; being seen as a gay male frightens me even as
it validates me. I am not transitioning as much as the world is
transitioning around me.]{.underline} Becoming More Monstrous, Becoming
More Separated Six months on testosterone. In boxing class at the gym.
I'm helping Bill rig the punching bags. He addresses me, looking me in
the eye: "So, you're in graduate school?" I say: "Yes, I'm in
sociology." As I speak, he attends to my chest, as if it is speaking. I
feel distinctly uncomfortable. My head feels dull and thick. I slow
down. I feel like I am not who I am. Alienation n. Being isolated from a
group; loss of identity in which the self seems unreal, thought to be
caused by difficulties in relating to society. Dissociation is a
familiar sensation. An odd feeling of being displaced out of my
body---that my chest is not mine. It is an uneasy feeling of
deterritorialization: feeling forced to psychically vacate myself,
because I am being taken for something I am not. Losing myself a little
bit for a moment each time I encounter interactions like this one, when
I am scrutinized. Since starting testosterone, my chest is the most
conspic- uous remaining feminine marker on my body. The thing that most
easily reveals my monstrosity now. Receiving stares into the chest made
me squirm before I came into my trans- ness, when I was
female-identified. A life of familiarity with everyday sexual
objectification. In this moment, I experience a mix of feelings.
Indignity. Disbelief. Anger. For me, gender dysphoria is a result of
interactive experi- ences like these. This intrusion is a normal way of
interacting with me. People are not hateful, or even overtly
transphobic. They just look at my body in a way that disregards the fact
that I might feel uncomfortable with them looking at me that way. They
look at my face, then my chest, then my face. It is a kind of double
take specific to transmasculine experience. A transmasculine-specific
microaggression. I am still squirm- ing inside, but it would create more
discomfort for me, were I to say anything about his action. It would
draw more atten- tion to the issue that I want to be a nonissue. The
class comes in. I feel the energy of the teacher look- ing at me with
wonderment. He's not looking at anyone else this way. As the class
starts, we begin calisthenics, and min- utes pass, the students silently
following me with their eyes as they exercise. I have everyone's
attention, and I do not want it. I try to move my body in a "masculine"
way, punch- ing the bag, weaving. Trying to convince them that I am not
interesting enough to be worth looking at. They feel entitled to look at
me, still. After 6 months on testosterone, my voice is deeper, my face
and body are more masculinized, I am growing more facial hair. And yet,
after 6 months, I am still a spectacle. I'm looking more like a guy but
something about me is still feminine enough, makes me monstrous enough,
to make them wonder. No one in these attentive audiences says anything,
but their silence does. The silent stare is a statement. Looking and not
speaking is also speaking. [After 6 months on testosterone, how am I
now? I am again and still, a betweener. I feel like a different creature
from "women" or "men." My gender and sexed transience move my
betweennesses around into new configurations. My sex-gender journeying
shifts the shape of my social being in other ways, too. I feel this
shifting through the energy of how other people interact with me. I
resist the inhumanity of their eyes. I am fully human in my gender-
fucking, transsexualizing monstrosity.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Alt -- Dwell in brokenness/Refusal

#### The alternative is a no to the AFF's demand -- the frustration of demand is productive and critical for subject formation. Only this interrogation of morality escapes the endless repetition of enjoyment and is a pre-requisite for political change. 

**Lundberg 12** (Lacan in Public: Psychoanalysis and the Science of
Rhetoric by Christian O. Lundberg 201. Co-Director of the University
Program in Cultural Studies, Associate Professor) EG

As a mode of individuation and subjectivization, [egos are economies of
frustration and compensation]{.underline}. This economy relies on a
split in the freudian demand, which [is]{.underline} [both a demand to
satiate a specific need and a demand for the addressee to provide an
automatic fulfillment of a need. The generative power of the demand
relies on]{.underline} two things: [the split between the demand and the
need that it attempts to redress, and the fact that some demands will be
refused]{.underline}. This [economy of need and frustration works
because the refusal of a specific need articulated as a demand on
another is also a refusal of the idea that the addressee of the demand
can fulfill all the subject's needs, requiring a set of compensatory
economic functions to negotiate the refusal of specific
demands.]{.underline} "[Ego]{.underline}," then, [names the economy of
compensatory subjectivization driven by the repetition and refusal of
demands. The]{.underline} nascent [subject presents wants and needs in
the form of the demand, but the role of the demand is not the simple
fulfillment of these wants and needs. The demand and its refusal are the
fulcrum on which the identity and insularity of the subject are
produced]{.underline}: an unformed amalgam of needs and articulated
demands is transformed into a subject that negotiates the vicissitudes
of life with others. Put in the metaphor of developmental psychology,
[an infant lodges the instinctual demands of the id on others but these
demands cannot be, and for the sake of development, must not be
fulfilled]{.underline}. Thus, pop psychology observations that the
incessant [demands]{.underline} of children [for impermissible
objects]{.underline} ("may i have a fourth helping of dessert") [or
meanings that culminate in ungroundable authoritative
pronouncements]{.underline} (the game of asking never ending "whys")
[are less about satisfaction of a request than the identity-producing
effects of the parental "no."]{.underline} in "The Question of Lay
Analysis," freud argues that ["if . . . demands meet with no
satisfaction, intolerable conditions arise]{.underline} . . . \[and\] .
. . the ego begins to function. . . . \[T\]he driving force that sets
the vehicle in motion is derived from the id, the ego . . . undertakes
the steering. . . . The task of the ego \[is\] . . . to mediate between
the claims of the id and the objections of the external world."^31^
Later, in *Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego,* and
*Civilization and Its Discontents,* [freud relocates the site of the
ego's genesis beyond the parent/child relationship and in the broader
social relationships that animate it. Life with others inevitably
produces blockages in the individual's attempts to fulfill certain
desires, since some demands for the fulfillment of desires must be
frustrated. This blockage produces feelings of guilt, which in turn are
sublimated as a general social morality. The frustration of demand is
both productive in that it authorizes social moral codes and, by
extension, civilization writ large, although it does so at the cost of
imposing a contested relationship between desire and social
mores.]{.underline}32 Confronted by student calls to join the movement
of 1968 Lacan famously quipped: "as hysterics you demand a new master:
you will get it!" understanding the meaning of his response requires a
treatment of Lacan's theory of the demand and its relationship to
hysteria as an enabling and c onstraining political subject position.
[Lacan's theory of the demand picks up at freud's movement outward from
the paradigmatic relationships between the par ent/ child and
individual/civilization toward a more general account of the subject,
sociality, and signification]{.underline}. The infrastructure supporting
this theoretical movement transposes freud's comparatively natural and
genetic account of development to a set of metaphors for dealing with
the subject's entry into signification. As already noted, the Lacanian
aphorism that "the signifier represents a subject for another signifier
inverts the conventional wisdom that a pre-g iven subject uses language
as an instrument to communicate its subjective intentions."^33^ The
paradoxical implication of this reversal is that [the subject is
simultaneously produced and disfigured by its unavoidable insertion into
the space of the Symbolic. An Es assumes an identity as a subject as a
way of accommodating to the Symbolic's demands and as a node for
producing demands on its others or of being recognized as a
subject]{.underline}.^34^ As i have already argued, [the demand
demonstrates that the enjoyment of one's own subjectivity is useless
surplus produced in the gap between the Es (or it) and the ideal
i]{.underline}. As a result, there is excess jouissance that remains
even after its reduction to hegemony. This remainder may even be logi
cally prior to hegemony, in that it is a useless but ritually repeated
retroactive act of naming the self that produces the subject and
therefore conditions possibility for investment in an identitarian
configuration.

To speak of desire in its multiplicities: the survival and breathing and
possibility of transfeminine desire amid and beyond our social and

ground a politicized understanding of our brokenness? **[To speak of our
states of brokenness: states where bodies are jammed, depowered,

rejection of sociality]{.underline}**; a state in which [we suspend care

state of understanding the workplace as a ruse of the expression of

or as women for selling sex as a means to money, the psychic fallout of
such disqualifications; **[the state in which community and cohesion do
not materialize into socially reproductive, sustainable

which discourses of sexuality and sexual reproduction elide the lived
particularities of our bodies;6 a state without a discourse to speak of
abuse and its impact on trans and queer bodies and lives in our/their
particulars; a state in which desire and need and love emerge only
through the inauguration of worlds that do not yet exist. **Such are
these states of our brokenness.**]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Alt -- Abjection

#### The alternative is to refuse reconstruction in favor of abjection, to acknowledge that the dismembered body exists outside of meaning, and acknowledge the ontological erosion resulting from the presence revealing an absence that the abjected body is.

Subjects: Towards a Cultural Analysis of the Abjected Self"; thesis for

Pp.81-82 //LFP accessed 7-22-19

The subjects in this thesis all express various facets related to
[abjection]{.underline}: the [alienation and isolation of
separation]{.underline}, [the violence of excision]{.underline}, the
loneliness and sadness, the [articulation of the
body-in-pain]{.underline}, the pulsating wound that always bears
witness. Many of the subjects in this thesis grapple with a sense of
locating the self, of [attempting to construct a sense of identity from
this fragmentation]{.underline}, often [internalizing the abjection and
regarding themselves as strange or foreign]{.underline}. [The aporia of
abjection]{.underline} [--- a process that renders something neither
object nor subject, alive nor dead --- is reminiscent of the
ghost]{.underline}. The ghost, like the abject, is threatening since [it
cannot be neatly pinned down;]{.underline} it [evokes uncanniness and
threatens the subject because it exists outside of meaning]{.underline}.
As I have explored through this thesis, abjection is a tale of
ghostification; [the abject separated from the body is circumscribed to
an ontological space that is "ghostly]{.underline}": seemingly
invisible, [a presence that reveals an absence]{.underline}. To consider
the abject as "[the ghostly subject" is to acknowledge the ontological
erosion that emerges in the wake of abjection and the fragmentation that
ensues]{.underline}. In his essay "on cultural anesthesia: From Desert
Storm to Rodney King" Allen Feldman describes cultural anesthesia as the
"insight that in a post-Holocaust and late capitalist modernity, the
quantitative and qualitative **[dissemination of objectification
increases the social capacity to inflict pain upon the
Other]{.underline}**...[to render the Other's pain inadmissible to
public discourse and culture]{.underline}" (406). He notes the
"derealizing" nature of the camera which renders abject bodies on screen
as "nonspecific" (fungible, to use Saidiya Hartman's word); erasing the
specificity of what's on screen further embodies and specifies the
audience --- as seen in The House is Black whose mission is to
"alleviate pain" yet presents its subjects as mute backdrops for
Farrokhzad's political poesis. The notion of "cultural anaesthesia" is
particularly pertinent in reference to the subjects of this thesis and
it prompts me to consider some necessary parting questions: Who is
speaking for the abject? Does it work to render the abject grotesque,
frightening, a thing of horror? Attempt to embody and is that embodiment
a form of hostage, appropriation --- like Takemoto's re-imaging in
Imag(in)ed Malady? Does it further abject the abject? Further ghostify
the ghost?

What Black feminists pointed to was that when the term
[feminist]{.underline} was used, it [evoked white ciswomen, its imagined
and idealized subject was white-ciswomencentered]{.underline}. [When we
say "woman" today we usually mean cisgender; a whole host of other
bodies, trans and gender non-conforming, are left out]{.underline} of
our imaginary. [It is important]{.underline}, too, [to note how the
visibility of transgender people, particularly the visibility of Black
and transgender women of color has shifted the grammars of Black
liberation]{.underline} this time. This time, Black liberation has laid
itself out as the platform for those most marginalized under
capitalisms' time. We name patriarchy, misogyny, and racial capitalism.
[Women, Black and Queer, become the faces and the voices this
time]{.underline}: Patrisse, Opal, Alicia, Charlene, CeCe. Agendas
launched in the name of Black women, Black femmes. [Say her
name.]{.underline} Black lives matter. Black Queer feminist lens. [Our
language has changed and we]{.underline} on the left (or left of left),
[have become hyper aware this time of the erasures that took place in
earlier]{.underline} Black liberation [movements]{.underline}. So when
we say Black lives matter we mean ALL Black lives matter. Trans and cis.
Gender Non-Conforming. Poor. Unemployed. No one is to be left behind
this time. Consumed by naming, naming ourselves and those who we have
lost, Sandra Bland, Chyna Gibson, Tamir Rice ... We long to account for
all the ways we have been separated from one another because of
generations of systematic oppression, violence, and the outright
predatory assault on our institutions, neighborhoods, families, and
bodies. Say her name. We know that our potential for liberation requires
a critical collectivity, a collective consciousness, but in our desires
to bring ourselves together some slippages occur, some
miscommunications. [Inclusion was/is necessary, but what did/does
inclusion truly mean**? Is the model being mirrored this time, still, a
neoliberal mode of diversity and inclusion**? Are the master's tools
still being harnessed to dismantle the master's house?]{.underline} I
point to the evocation of a term like All Black Lives Matter and ask
what it says about how we, this time, long to account for difference
within our Black liberation movement. Have our desires for inclusion,
compelled us to believe we were accounting for difference within? [Are
we still uneasy and unsure of how to deal with difference so we mollify
it with ands? Black women, trans, and cis]{.underline}. In Cathy Cohen's
2015 interview "Ask a Feminist: A Conversation with Cathy Cohen on Black
Lives Matter, Feminism, and Contemporary Activism," she states, "[cis
and trans women---have to be at the center]{.underline} of how we think
about black liberation. [The centering of cis and trans women and
lesbians and gay men as members and leaders of our
communities]{.underline}, that to me [is significant and
new.]{.underline}" She later continues, "I don't think we have often
seen movements say that the common thread 440 Souls October--December
2017 of blackness is not just the male body, or the presumed cis male
body, but in fact that cis and trans black women can represent the
intersectional positionality and oppression that black communities
face."4 In a similar fashion, my good friend and comrade, Charlene
Carruthers, the national director of BYP100 (an organization that is a
part of the broader movement for Black lives) writes in a 2016
Colorlines article, "The execution of Korryn Gaines at the hands of the
Baltimore County Police Department (BCoPD) requires a national
call-to-action to defend Black women. Gaines's story shows us the
inextricable links between the struggles to secure Black liberation and
reproductive justice in America. In this moment, [everyone who believes
that Black lives do indeed matter is needed to build a defense of Gaines
and all Black women (transgender and cisgender]{.underline}) who are
victims of state-sanctioned violence."5 [How does the category of woman
function here? Who is it able to hold and how is it able to hold
difference? Those of us who are interested in Black **liberation must be
weary of the "and" in "trans and cis"** as it purports to have reckoned
with the real difference and fissures that rest between trans and
cis]{.underline}. It is a question of relationality. How do we/they
belong to one another[? **The "and" here is not natural as it seeks to
bring transgender women into the fold of the category women** (read
cisgender), **a category that has been critiqued by Black and Women of
Color feminists as a category that continuously fails**, fails to
articulate clearly what it is that makes some women, who are not white,
who are not middle class, illegible as the imagined universalized
representative subject of the category. So we are left asking (1) Are
Black women, women? (When? How?) (2) If not, why do we hold on to that
category "woman" at all?]{.underline} (When? How?) It seems to me that
[many scholars and organizers assume the answer to Sojourner Truth's
question, "ain't I a woman?" is "Yes!" But what if we instead took the
gift of Truth as a proposition to dwell in the question? Do models of
inclusion prohibit us from thinking about or asking for something else?
Even more challenging: **what would something else look like without the
organizing binary of male and female?**]{.underline} And even more
challenging than that: [what about all the ways we love gender, being
seen as either this or that? We work within these limited categorical
identities even though we know their limitations, even when we see that
they can't account for the nuances of holistic being.]{.underline} I
think [we fear non-existence without them as a sign post to remind us
that we are human. The fear of non-existence is a logical fear for Black
people and queer people as our relationship to premature death is almost
always already pre-determined]{.underline} under racial capitalism and
patriarchy. [But the non-existence that I want those of us who are
working toward Black liberation and gender liberation]{.underline} or
gender self-[determination is the non-existence or erasure that we
impose on one another consciously and unconsciously. As our grammars
shift and change to be more inclusive, particularly when it comes to a
Black queer feminist politic that consciously names "cis and
trans"]{.underline} as a modifier of "woman," **[we must be careful
about what the and then dislodges.]{.underline}** [It is not productive
to simply add transgender women to the category of woman without
thinking through the ways that transgender women force us to consider
again how "woman" as a category is a failure.]{.underline} If we simply
add "woman (cis and trans)" as the proper subjects of feminist politics,
then [what happens to men who have lived as women? Are they no longer a
part of the narrative? Are we able to hold the stories of both CeCe
McDonald, Marissa Alexander, and Kye Peterson]{.underline}6 under this
inclusive Black Queer Feminist framing? I [seek a Black feminist praxis
that can hold all of these people, but in order for that to be the case
we may have to disentangle ourselves from a reliance on "woman" and
instead think through the ways in which femininity and masculinity are
moving in and across all kinds of bodies.]{.underline} [The category
"woman" remains attached to notions of biological authenticity and
realness that inevitably reaches its limits when trying to capture
bodies that shift]{.underline}, trans bodies. Basically, what I am
getting at is that we can and should shift our grammar and language to
be more inclusive, but understand too that [the way we think of
women/men, this binary is undone (and sometimes redone) by transgender
and gender-nonconforming people whose gender journeys aren't always
linear.]{.underline}

#### Bad comparison for transpeople to be compared to cis gendered people

**Glover and Kaplan 00** (David Glover: Emeritus Professor of English
within English at the University of Southampton; Cora Kaplan: Honorary
Professor in the School of English and Drama at Queen Mary, "Genders",
2000)

[No one knows precisely when and where gender was initially used to
refer to the social and cultural aspects of sexual difference, but it is
clear that the term was already current in sexology by the early
1960s.]{.underline} For example, gender does not figure in Alex
Comfort's post-war overview of Sexual Behaviour in Society (1950) until
the book was revised for publication some thirteen years later (under
the new title Sex in Society), when the author added a brief discussion
of 'gender roles'. Significantly, this was placed in a chapter on 'The
Biological Background' to human sexuality, in which Comfort stressed the
difficulty in knowing the extent to which our sexual behaviour was
instinctive, given 'the far greater importance of higher mental
functions in man' than in the other animal species (Comfort 1963: 34).
[This explains why: The 'gender role' which an individual adopts --
'manly' or 'womanly' -- according to the standards of his culture, is
oddly enough almost wholly learned, and little if at all built in; in
fact, the gender role learned by the age of two years is for most
individuals almost irreversible, even if it runs counter to the physical
sex of the subject.]{.underline} (Comfort 1963: 42) '[Gender' is used
here to index the wide variation in styles of behaviour between
societies, but it also suggests that within them the degree of choice is
fairly limited]{.underline}. By making his readers aware of these
cultural differences, Comfort hoped to demystify human sexuality and so
help to release them from what he believed were unnecessary and
irrational sexual taboos. At the same time, however, his more guarded
emphasis upon the irreversibility of gender roles seems to tell against
the promise of any easily accessible path to sexual liberation. For
liberal humanists like Comfort it was often hard to understand why
sexual enlightenment should appear to lag so far behind the other modes
of social and technological progress. Probably the most thorough attempt
to theorize the distinction between sex and gender in this period is to
be found in the writings of the psychoanalyst and anthropologist Robert
J. Stoller, whose book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity
and Femininity appeared in 1968. Stoller located the starting-point for
his work in Freud's paper on 'The Psychogenesis of a Case of
Homosexuality in a Woman' (1920) which argued [that a person's physical
sexual attributes, mental attitudes and objects of desire could 'vary
independently of one another'; so that 'a man with predominantly male
characteristics and also masculine in his erotic life may still be
inverted in respect to his object, loving only men instead of
women']{.underline} (Freud 1979: 9.398--9). In a similar vein, [Stoller
used the term 'gender' to signal the complexities of those 'tremendous
areas of behaviour, feelings, thoughts, and fantasies that are related
to the sexes and yet do not have primarily biological
connotations']{.underline} (Stoller 1968: ix). [Not only do we tend to
confuse sex and gender, however. We also assume too readily that the
various components of gender are mutually reinforcing]{.underline},
whereas in fact they may well pull in different directions. In addition
to separating sex from gender analytically, therefore, [Stoller
distinguished between 'gender role' and 'gender identity' in order to
indicate that one's inner and outer life may be deeply conflicted or
fail to coincide. The gender role that one plays out before others may
offer little clue as to who one feels oneself to be]{.underline}, and
consequently in Stoller's theory the very definition of gender identity
is founded upon the possibility of an inner discord, a kind of
non-identity with one's sexual being: [Gender identity starts with the
knowledge and awareness, whether conscious or unconscious, that one
belongs to one sex and not the other, though as one develops, gender
identity becomes much more complicated, so that, for example, one may
sense himself as not only a male but a masculine man or an effeminate
man or even as a man who fantasies being a woman]{.underline}. (Stoller
1968: 10)

### 1NC -- Link - Coalitions

#### Feminist coalitions in their normative state right now are exclusionary and don't challenge the structures that they intend to combat. 

**Butler 90 (Judith Butler, 1990, "Gender Trouble", pgs. 9-11,**
[[http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf]{.underline}](http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf))//AR

The contemporary feminist debates over essentialism raise the question
of the universality of female identity and masculinist oppression in
other ways. Universalistic claims are based on a common or shared
epistemological standpoint, understood as the articulated consciousness
or shared structures of oppression or in the ostensibly transcultural
structures of femininity, maternity, sexuality, and/or ecriture
feminine. The opening discussion in this chapter argued that [this
globalizing gestured has spawned a number of criticisms from women who
claims that the category of "women" is normative and exclusionary and is
invoked with the unmarked dimensions of class and racial privilege
intact.]{.underline} In other words, **[the insistence upon the
coherence and unity of the category of women has effectively refused the
multiplicity of cultural, social and political intersections in which
the concrete array of "women" are constructed]{.underline}**. [Some
efforts have been made to formulate coalitional politics which do not
assume in advance what the content of "women" will be]{.underline}. They
propose instead of a set of dialogic encounters by which variously
positioned women articulate separate identities within the framework of
an emergent coalition[. Clearly, the value of coalitional politics is
not to be underestimated, but the very form of coalition, of an emerging
and unpredictable assemblage of positions, cannot be figured in
advance.]{.underline} Despite the clearly democratizing impulse that
motivates coalition building, **[the coalitional theorist can
inadvertently reinsert herself as sovereign of the process by trying to
assert an ideal form for coalitional structures in advance, one that
will effectively guarantee unity as the outcome]{.underline}**. Related
efforts to determine what is and is not the true shape of a dialogue,
what constitutes a subject-position, and, most importantly when "unity"
has been reached, can impede the shelf-shaping and self-limiting
dynamics of coalition. [The insistence in advance on coalitional "unity"
as a goal assumes that solidarity, whatever its price, is a prerequisite
for political action]{.underline}. But what sort of politics demands
that kind of advance purchase on unity? Perhaps [a coalition needs to
acknowledge its contradictions and take actions with those
contradictions intact. Perhaps also part of what dialogic understanding
entails is the acceptance of divergence, breakage, splinter and
fragmentation as part of the often torturous process of
democratization.]{.underline} [The very notion of "dialogue" is
culturally specific and historically bound, and while one speaker may
feel secure that a conversation is happening, another may be sure it is
not. The power relations that condition and limit dialogic possibilities
need first to be interrogated. Otherwise, the model of dialogue risks
relapsing into **a liberal model that assumes that speaking agents
occupy equal positions of power and speak with the same presuppositions
about what constitutes "agreement" and "unity" and, indeed, that those**
are the goals to be sought.]{.underline} [It would be wrong to assume in
advance that there is a category of women that simply needs to be filled
in with various components of race, class, age, ethnicity, and sexuality
in order to become complete. The assumption of its essential
incompleteness permits that category to serve as a permanently available
site of contested meanings**.**]{.underline} The definitional
incompleteness of the category might then serve as a normative ideal
relieved of coercive force. [Is "unity" necessary for effective
political action?]{.underline} Is the premature insistence on the goal
of unity precisely the cause of an ever more bitter fragmentation among
the ranks? Certain forms of acknowledged fragmentation might facilitate
coalitional action precisely because the "unity" of the category of
women is neither presupposed nor desired. Does "unity" set up an
exclusionary norm of solidarity at the level of identity that rules out
the possibility of a set of actions which disrupt the very borders of
identity concepts, or which seek to accomplish precisely that disruption
as an explicit political aim[? Without the presupposition or goal of
"unity", which is, in either case, always instituted at a conceptual
level, provisional unities might emerge in the context of concrete
actions that have purposes other than the context of concrete actions
that have purposes other than the articulation of identity]{.underline}.
Without the compulsory expectation that feminist actions must be
instituted from some stable, unified, and agreed upon identity, those
actions might well get a quicker start and seem more congenial to a
number of "women" for whom the meaning of the category is permanently
moot.

#### Coalitions place excess amounts of gender labor on people of color

[Too often racial justice and LGBT rights movements are severed from one
another, causing queer people of color to constantly compartmentalize
their identities]{.underline}. [Take me for example. I am a black, gay,
genderqueer activist and college student]{.underline}. [Whenever I walk
into my college's black student Union meetings, I feel obliged to have
my blackness come first and my queerness come second. This feeling is
only reinforced when members argue that talking about queerness, gender
justice, etc. "distracts" us from the "real" work at hand or that
focusing on those issues will make our movement less palatable.
Similarly, whenever I walk into Pride meetings, I feel obliged to put my
queerness first and my blackness second]{.underline}. With Pride
Alliances (and other similar factions across college campuses in the
US), most of the members are white, so they too feel like talking about
the intersections of queerness and blackness is distracting or
irrelevant. As recent examples show, my experience does not exist apart
from larger social realities[. In an age where "intersectionality" is a
household name in almost all social justice communities, we still face
unintersectional politics]{.underline}. For example, we are still having
debates about the lack of intersectionality within white feminism. [The
murders of black women, queer people, and trans people by police
brutality are still getting routinely erased in the #BlackLivesMatter
movement even though the movement was founded by queer women of
color]{.underline}. [Queer students at historically black universities
still report high rates of homophobia, sexism, femiphobia, and sexual
assault. The disabled community still reports discrimination and erasure
from just about all modern social movements]{.underline}. Women of color
who identify as fat are still excluded from the predominately white fat
studies and body positive movements. Many queer and feminist movements
still condemn kink communities, arguing they reproduce gendered power
structures. Weigman states that the problem with identity studies is
that it requires you to speak as the subject, limiting your possibility
of speaking about things you may not identify, as well as requiring you
to be the expert about your identity (Weigman 2012: 8). Identity
politics dichotomize categories, obscuring and even erasing the radical
potential of queer politics. The question that remains is how. How do we
move away from identity politics and towards a process of movement
building that is truly inclusive, one that actually builds a more
effective base of solidarity? [Cohen suggests we must turn to the
process of movement-building rooted in our shared marginal relationship
to dominant power which normalizes, legitimizes, and
privileges]{.underline} (Cohen 1997: 448); This movement-building
practice is also known as coalition building. Coalitions are at the
heart of Weigman's and Cohen's suggestions for change. However, [I would
like to problematize one element of coalition building: gender
labor]{.underline}. ["Gender labor" is a term coined by Jane Ward,
describing the effort (emotional, physical, and sexual or otherwise) in
performing one's gender to others, validating other's gender, and of
coproducing someone's "gender irony, transgression, or
exceptionality"]{.underline} (Ward 2010: 237). [In my experience,
whenever I step into coalitional spaces, the labor of expressing
difficult politics is always placed on the most marginalized---women of
color, trans women of color, low-income people of color, etc. For
example, I participated in a local grassroots movement in Geneva, NY
called "Tools for Social Change." This organizing group, composed of
members of the Geneva community of various racial, gender, age, ability,
and socioeconomic backgrounds]{.underline} (e.g. professors, students at
Hobart and William Smith Colleges, working class families in Geneva,
city council members, etc.), aims to improve the racial climate of
Geneva by giving voice to the most marginalized members of the city (in
this case low-income people of color). Their tactics include strategic
goal planning and implementation, casual-style discussions, fishbowl
discussions, and lobbying. [What I found in attending these meetings is
that the most marginalized members of the meeting are placed in the
position of articulating their lived experience, over and over, to a
wide range of privileged bodies]{.underline}: ones who are "empathetic"
yet still mess up a lot, ones who think they know more than they
actually do, ones who navigate with a white savior complex (an idea of
helping "poor people of color" for the sake of boosting their own
selfperception as "good" people, instead of changing the lives of the
most marginalized), etc. [This constant articulation of one's lived
experience to an audience full of receptive, faux receptive, and even
unreceptive coalition members, is a daunting form of gender labor. To
simply exist and create better means for oneself through the privileges
of others requires the marginalized subject to expend constant and often
times more amounts of gender labor than their privileged counterparts.
That is one major problem I find in coalitional spaces. My central
question, then, is how do we create a structure of organizing that moves
away from identity politics and towards effective solidarity without
obliging marginalized subjects to expend excess amounts of gender labor,
if any at all?]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Link - Tranifestation

**White tranifestation is exclusive - it is fundamentally impossible for
black trans to experience a shift in gender because of a lack of
ontology.**

Calvin Warren is an assistant professor of American studies at George
Washington University. His book Ontological Terror: Blackness, Nihilism,
and Emancipation is forthcoming from Duke University Press

Calling into Being Can we represent the black self through a call into
being? What manifestation is possible, ontologically, within the context
of an antiblack world (and an antiblack field of being)? What might such
a transformative call entail? I present these questions to build a way,
or a putative path, toward understanding the necessity of black trans,
as a philosophical practice/procedure. For, indeed, undergirding these
inquiries is a desire, or desperation, to provide intellectual space for
black trans. [It is undeniable that black trans "beings" have
experienced tremendous violence, routinized humiliation, and systemic
terror]{.underline}. Black trans, as a discursive formation, is charged
with an exceptionally difficult task: creating the intellectual occasion
for recognizing, interpreting, and introducing black trans experience
into a larger field of inquiry. But how exactly is this done? One
strategy is to appropriate the ontological presumptions and foundations
of humanism to gain recognition and intellectual space---ground upon
which much trans/ gender/sexuality/black studies is predicated. In this
meditation, I suggest that appropriating humanism is an unreliable
strategy for black trans, since ontology and humanism do not "explain
the existence of the black" (Fanon 1967a: 110). Tranifestation is such a
strategy, and I suggest it is applicable to humans but not blacks.
[Furthermore, I argue that we can reconceptualize black trans not as an
ontological formation (i.e., nonnormative human subjects) but as a
speculative or philosophical enterprise---one designed to devastate
ontological humanism. Tranifestation provides a philosophical space of
investigation, in which the question of black existence infuses itself
into the discourses of gender and experience. There is no escaping this
question, since the ontological ground within which gender and
experience are located raises particular concerns for blackness. If
gender and experience are features of a self capable of representation
and transformation---as the theory of tranifestation seems to suggest---
then it is the ontology of this self that provides the necessary ground
(or condition of possibility) for any procedure of
manifestation.]{.underline} Furthermore, this self possesses the
capacity to call into being, to inquire, demand, and extract from
being's mysterious resources, something transformative, something that
challenges normativity, a being. Manifestation, then, evidences a
successful call, in which the transformed being serves as being's answer
to this very call. The self is represented through the call, and
representation is the creative appeal to being---creative since it is
transformative. In short[, tranifestation is ontological creation, and
the call is the mysterious vehicle for the self to manifest anew. The
question of black existence, however, inquires about this call and the
possibility of being--- transformed or otherwise. For if manifestation
is the evidence of a successful call into being, then **the black never
manifests in an antiblack world, since the black lacks
being**.]{.underline} In other words, the lack of being is the evidence
of an unsuccessful call---an appeal to being that is ultimately
rejected. Christina Sharpe suggests that the "idea of being is
foreclosed to us: we're non-being" (Terrefe 2016).1 The experience of
suffering and violence, although quite real and devastating, fails to
provide being for blackness[. Blacks can experience trans violence, but
this experience does not translate into being trans.]{.underline}2 It is
this devastating split between existence (the province of experience)
and being (the field of ontology) that constitutes the core of black
suffering in an antiblack world and renders the black
catachrestic---unrepresentable as a self. Fanon reminds us of this
devastation when he avers, "Ontology---once it is finally admitted as
leaving existence by the wayside---does not permit us to understand the
being of the black man . . . the black man has no ontological resistance
in the eyes of the white man" (1967a: 110). [We might understand
tranifestation, then, as a mode of "ontological resistance," in which
the self manifests despite the violence of gendered normativity. Selves
capable of resisting, ontologically, have the capacity to synthesize
experience and ontology into a call for being anew. But the black
existence lacks ontological resistance--- the capacity not only to call
but also to have that call answered and acknowledged---because of the
split between existence and ontology, a treacherous gulf that is
unbridgeable. Thus, trans experience does not equate to trans being for
blacks]{.underline}---for, ultimately, only those who can resist
ontology can be. (It is impossible for blacks to tranifest in an
antiblack world.) Existence is experienced but unrepresentable with the
transformative instruments of ontology. But what is this "experiencing
black" if this black lacks being? This is the fundamental question of
black existence, and it is a question that, perhaps, lacks any
sufficient answer, given our philosophical paucity. Black thought must
continually broach this fundamental question with the resources at our
disposable--- however inadequate or insufficient these resources are for
our task. Jean-Luc Nancy suggests that "ontology is a phonology" to the
extent that the law of being calls, or summons, the place of Dasein
(1993: 45).3 Tranifestation's calling into being, its onto-phonological
procedure, requires certain metaphysical coordinates of latitudinal and
longitudinal richness. The preposition into, from which being is called,
suggests a certain space of creativity and transformation that manifests
in a "thereness." The place of manifestation is this very thereness for
the self. We might think [of gender, then, as a particular metaphysical
coordinate along an onto-metaphysical plane, which provides an
intelligible place for the self. But to have a place, a thereness along
the onto-metaphysical plane, being is necessary]{.underline}. Black
trans-gender thus stages and raises the question of place: can blacks
inhabit a place in the world along the coordinates of gender (or any
other coordinates for that matter)? For if, as Hortense Spillers (2003:
206) argues, blacks are "reduced to a thing, to being for the captor,"
and not being for itself, then the black does not inhabit the world as a
self but as a thing (or no-thing that we can understand with the
instruments of ontology). The thing can experience the world, but the
thing lacks a place within the world, the requisite coordinates of
thereness for a self. Or as Frank Wilderson would suggest, "No slave
\[black existence\] is in the world" (2010: 11). When Spillers limns the
philosophical problematic of gender and ontology, she seems to suggest
this very lack of place of an ontological coordinate for this
experiencing thing: "This problematization of gender places her \[black
ungendered female\], in my view, out of the traditional symbolics of
female gender, and it our task to make a place for this different social
subject"(2003: 238). But this (non)place that we make for this
ungendered thing is not a recognizable place within ontology---if we can
even call this conceptual space a "place." [Placing blackness within
gender, or finding the place of blackness along gender, is an impossible
project. And for this reason, Spillers suggests that "we are less
interested in joining the ranks of gendered femaleness than gaining the
insurgent ground as female social subject]{.underline}" (239). The
(non)place of black gender is the foreclosure of a call to being---
since no "into" exists for blackness from which being can be called. In
a conversation revisiting "Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe," Hortense Spillers
et al. present the term symbiotic blend to describe a melding between
gender categories (2007: 304). Given that [antiblackness disqualifies
blackness from the privilege of traditional gendered categories, black
existence becomes something other, a blend of sorts of categories that
is unrecognizable as gender. We might call this symbiotic blend a form
of transness, in which the blending troubles not just gender categories
but also the categories of the human itself. Black trans presents the
problem of ontology through gender]{.underline}, and this problematic is
the philosophical melding of black feminism and black trans studies. In
other words, black feminism (in particular the groundbreaking work of
Spillers) provides a path, or a philosophical opening, for the
deconstructive work of black trans studies. As Kai M. Green and Treva
Ellison state, both black feminism studies and black trans studies
"challenge the categories of man and woman as ontological givens" (2014:
223). But what I want to reiterate is that this path, or opening, does
not stop with gender, although it catalyzes it. [The problematic that
black trans studies raises is that ontology itself is the fundamental
issue---gender serves as the covering for a deeper onto-metaphysical
challenge, the lack of the onto-phonological procedure. But we have
focused on an aspect of the philosophical phrase opening our meditation;
it is time to return to the fullness of the phrase, for it illumines the
(non)relation between blackness and ontology. Green modifies the phrase
"calling into being" with the word attempts. Tranifesting attempts to
call into being. What would such an attempt entail? What is the
significance and aim of the attempt? I have argued that calling into
being is an impossible enterprise for blackness because such an
onto-phonological procedure is absent. There is only
muteness]{.underline}, an interdiction on phonology and placing. When
blackness is concerned, such a call encounters a censure on the
ontological activity of calling itself---meaning that such an attempt is
not a call at all, but something other. The attempt, then, undermines
itself at its very deployment, from its announcement into being. Put
differently, the attempt marks a certain fraudulence, and thus the word
attempt is absolutely essential to any call of blackness. Blackness,
then, can only attempt the impossible; the attempt never manifests into
a call but a rebounded muteness within the terrifying chamber of being.
The word attempts announces its own failure (i.e., the call as
muteness), or the fractured aim of the enterprise (i.e., it is not a
call, but something which we lack a grammar to describe within the
precincts of onto-metaphysics). The aim of such an attempt is
"masocritical," as Paul Mann (1999) would call it, given that it sets
out to undermine itself in relation to being (and finds pleasure in such
an enterprise). What antiblackness does is that it mutes blackness (this
is black suffering), and this muteness signals the lack of phonology.

#### The attempt to tranifest produce misery and disappointment because of its impossibility -- similar to the death drive.

[The attempt masks failure as possibility, muteness as transformative.
**Such an attempt only reproduces the structure of misery and
disappointment**. Why do we attempt the impossible? Is this not a
similar structure to the psychoanalytic notion of "drive"--- the
unrelenting attempt to possess an impossible (nonexistent) object, even
to the death? **Tranifestation dockets a certain drive (perhaps a death
drive) within black critical discourses**. We attempt, relentlessly, to
achieve an impossible objective--- to call into being, despite muteness
and lack of space. We might also suggest that tranifestation is
seductive, or it]{.underline} at-*tempts*, with the possibility that the
impossible can be overcome or that we might be heard in our silence, and
this muted hearing might create space in being. Such **[ontological
fantasizing is tempting when the aim is ontological
creation]{.underline}**. But such a procedure reaches an impasse: How
would we create such space in being? How does muteness create? What is a
muted call? Does the muteness of the call undermine the call itself?
Many would probably argue that muteness is powerful--- there is power in
silence. This is an interesting avenue for thought, but tranifestation
leaves such a possibility unattended, perhaps because it does not intend
that a call would be mute in the first place---it advances an argument
that blackness is capable of calling just like everyone else. This is
the fatal attempt of humanist philosophy, and it is one that we continue
to pursue despite the impossibility of the aim. In short, blackness must
overcome or traverse such an attempt--- although it is tempting. Matt
Richardson (2013) might call the knotting of seduction, desire, and
impossibility the nexus between the "irresolvable" (structural position
of otherness) and "irresolution" (unfixed). The juxtaposing of blackness
and tranifestation is precisely this nexus of the structural position of
the other of ontology and the unfixed movement into being. The call is
designed to suture the gap between irresolution and irresolvability. But
black existence is this very gap, and it is this gap that black trans
orbits and must approach. Tranifestation, encountering the muteness of
blackness, can lead the way into a field of critical inquiry concerning
muteness and ontology. We can use tranifestation as a signpost to refuse
the seductions of onto-phonology and the violence such a procedure
inflicts on black bodies. II. Black Trans as Instructive For black
things inhabiting the world in a (non)place, the call to being is always
already foreclosed. Blackness remains mute before being. This equates to
an existence without being, an inhabitation without a manifestation. The
experiencing thing does not transform into any being---nonnormative or
otherwise. This is the crux of black suffering and the violence that is
ontological. I would argue, however, that the concept of tranifestation
provides a beautiful structure to understand both being and nonbeing, or
blackness. Tranifestation presents the ontological procedures necessary
to establish being-in-the-world, and, implicitly, it explains why the
black transgender will never constitute a being or subject within the
world: because antiblackness precludes the onto-phonological procedure.
In other words, tranifestation is the inverse of Fanon's description of
black existence, as that lacking ontological resistance. The tranifested
subject uses the call as resistance in the face of gendered normativity
and hostility. This is an exceptional tool for humans to refashion
themselves, but such refashioning is not possible for blacks within
ontology---despite the seductions of invention. The black transgender
lacks any being-in-the-world, and the lure of gendered embodiment
functions as a foil to black muteness. In other words, the body is
called upon to speak being where there is none. Black bodily experience
is charged with the impossible--- to transform black into ontological
subject. Indeed, a body is not an ontology. Embodiment might provide the
ground for phenomenological experience, but once "ontology leaves
existence by the wayside," as Fanon (1967a: 110) suggests, black
embodied experience is unexplainable and inassimilable ontologically.
Within this context, "black trans" serves a speculative function, in
that it foregrounds the gap between black existence and being through
the coordinates of gender. Instead of thinking of black transgender as a
nonnormative (gendered) subject in the world, we can think of it as
instructive, philosophically. The black is trans to gender, not
transgender. The black is trans to queerness, not black queer. The black
is trans to the world itself and all its coordinates of being. What
black transgender is teaching us is the impossibility of finding
symbolic coherency in the world. Gender is a cloak, an ontic garment.
We've clothed ourselves in these garments, although they do not fit and
were not intended for us. It is time for us to disrobe and face the
naked of blackness, its nothingness. Black trans is precisely the
process of denuding the garments of being, and the black transgender
provides an opportunity to work through this process through the
experience of outof-placeness. We can understand black trans as undoing
and denuding ontological procedures and practices---exposing "nothing"
at the core of black existence. A philosophical practice of black trans
would undress critical discourses of the onto-phonological procedures,
which set them into motion and sustain their ethical ground. Its aim
would be to point us to the irresolvable tension between ontology and
existence through the breakdown, or undoing, of human gender (i.e.,
gender becomes but one philosophical pathway or allegory to
understanding the conundrum of blackness). [Black studies (and queer
studies/trans studies), I would argue, is in desperate need of a black
trans procedure. There is a disturbing resurgence of humanism and its
universal ontology in the fields of black, gender, and sexuality
studies. The ontological ground of such discourses is rarely
interrogated, resulting in fantastical ideas of universal humanism,
postrace thematics, coalition politics, and race blindness. All these
critical idioms neglect the ontological dimension of antiblackness, in
order to provide resolution and resolvability of the tension between
blackness and being. Black trans, as I imagine it here, would unravel
ontological humanism, which sustains a death drive, one instantiating
tremendous misery, disappointment, and agony. Thus, black trans is not
invested in the ontology of trans studies, queer theory, and black
romantic humanism. Its aim is to impose seismiclike devastation on these
fields to expose the antiblack violence that sustains them]{.underline}
(even aspects of black studies relying on antiblack instruments of
ontology, humanism, metaphysics, biopolitics, and futurity). Black trans
studies must overcome tranifestation and its seductions---even as the
philosophical structure of tranifestation beautifully explains the
mechanism by which the human creates ontologically

### 1NC -- Link -- Dysphoria - Halberstam

#### Dysphoria is an outdated term. The aff's focus on limiting dysphoria/only aiding those who feel dysphoria forces them into the position of a truscum, the person who decides who is trans 'enough' based off of violent, medicalized models of trans bodies. Being trans\* must be understood as a near limitless plethora of expressions and identities as to guarantee any trans\* radical movement does not end up re-entrenching the very forms of gender checking they seek to destroy.

**Halberstram 16 (Jack, Professor of Gender Studies and English at

Configurations of Body, History, Memory and Kinship," Parallax, 7/24/16,

...[trans adults must cope with the deeply different trajectories and
life chances of the smallest gender outlaws.]{.underline} Some of these
children may elect to be stealth (maintain total privacy about their
gender histories) as adults; some may never identify openly as
transgender; many will never go through their natal puberties or retain
childhood memory books filled with pictures that do not mirror their
gender identities as adults. [For these reasons, this new generation may
have wider latitude to disidentify with transgender history and with
those who came before them]{.underline}. 2 While Meadow does not follow
up on this point in this short essay, it is quite a mind-blowing
statement. Unlike other social justice formations where young people
might acknowledge and even thank the adults who came before them and
made the world a more hospitable place, Meadow proposes that [the
support that many trans children now enjoy from their families and
communities affords them a radically different experience of childhood
than that of trans people even a decade older. While transgender
individuals of my generation, now in their forties and fifties, who
often could not transition until they were adults, lacked a complex
language for their gender variance and had to live large parts of their
lives in relations to gender identities with which they were at odds,
today's gender nonconforming children,]{.underline} Meadow reminds us,
with parental support[, may grow up trans rather than struggling through
long periods of enforced gender normativity. While that is a cause for
some amount of celebration, it also, Meadow hints, puts them at odds
with the history that produced the conditions for their smooth (er)
passage from trans childhood to adulthood. And indeed, perhaps the
disidentification that Meadow describes between a new generation of
trans children/young adults and the generations that came before them is
precisely what has given rise to battles over naming.]{.underline} While
a term like 'tranny' for an older generation hearkens back to a time
when medical terminology dominated the landscape and forced gender
variant people to present in gender normative bodies for long periods in
their lives[, for younger trans people, the term 'tranny' speaks to a
shadowy world where insults had to be rehabilitated and turned into
identity claims and where trans was always a marker of some kind of
irresolvable damage and dysphoria. Indeed, **the term 'dysphoria'
itself, a term that allowed earlier generations to explain their bodily
discomfort, has fallen out of favor and stands as a reminder of the bad
old days**. For all of these reasons the classification of 'trans\*'
performs necessary work in the crowded marketplace of signifiers and
signifieds that makes up our current transgender lexicons. Trans\*
borrows from internet search protocols where an asterisk functions as a
wildcard or a place holder for any and all unknown terms associated with
the word in question. Rather than falling into the trap of replacing one
system of classification with disciplinary effects with another
vernacular but just as normalizing system, I prefer to use the term
trans\* and to leave the variability open as a question for any and all
bodies. The open question of variability and its meanings is
particularly meaningful when it comes to child and adolescent
bodies.]{.underline} Again, if we return to Meadow's insightful
observations on the topic, Meadow reminds us that adult observations on
children's gender identities are skewed by certain assumptions: 'A
central paradox animates all of these efforts to define the transgender
child. [While most adults understand gender development teleologically,
they still struggle with whether and how to distinguish childhood
self-knowledge from adult identity. They labor to determine if gender is
ever fluid or stable, unfinished or finished, a property of the self or
a creation of the outside world.']{.underline} 3 In other words[, for
some children, their gender variance is the beginning of a life-long
sense of gender-nonconformity. For others, gender variance is a stage to
pass through, and for still others gender variance in childhood has
little or no connection to how they might identify as
adults]{.underline}. For example, some children have a sense of being in
the 'wrong body' that is so pronounced that they cannot function until
their sense of their gender variance is acknowledged and addressed. For
others, say tomboys who grow up to be heterosexual, cis-gendered women,
their early expressions of gender variance are part of a struggle with
the narrow scope of conventional womanhood. And finally, there are
children who may experiment wildly with gender and sexuality their whole
lives rather than experiencing their gender identities as part of a
process that gets resolved, finished, stabilized or completed

### 1NC -- Link -- Dysphoria - Irigaray

#### The aff's framing of dysphoria to analyze the world is inadequate because sexual difference in normative discourse is primarily told through the male subject position. The woman occupies only a partial subject position in relation to the male which means that an analysis of sexual difference in discourse is a pre-requisite.

**Boothroyd No Date (David Boothroyd, "Sexual Politics and Sexual
Difference: Luce Irigaray",** pgs. 136-137)//AR

At this point I shall turn to Irigaray's writings on and of the body; to
how they must be read in the context of this philosophical rethinking of
the language-reality relation; and to how the interpretative activity
this engenders might also be understood as a political strategy for
accomplishing real change in the phallocratic determination of both
societal and personal relations. In an attempt to overcome the
determination of women's subjectivity, on both conceptual and practical
levels, [according to masculinist models of thought and by men
themselves, Irigaray undertakes what is most readily described as a
discursive appropriation of the female body. This involves accounting
for the female's body specificity otherwise then by reflecting it in a
language that is structured according to the specificity of the male
sex.]{.underline} The problem she identifies is: [how to think
femaleness without subordinating this thinking to what could be termed
phallo-mimesis. In the course of this process, it could fairly be said
that Irigary's discourse breaks with common sense and the apparently
transparent, founding notions normally deployed to calculate the
political value and impact of ideas.]{.underline} **[Theoretical notions
such as consciousness, agency, autonomy, identity, freedom, etc., all of
which figure in determining the meaningfulness and scope of action or
practice, and all of 'which are thought on the basis of metaphysical
arche-tropes of the male sex, namely, those of presence, unity, and
visibility, are subjected to a redetermination on the basis of the
female sex (sexe).]{.underline}** (I note here that the French word
sexe, which straddles the conceptual distinction between sex, gender,
genitalia, and sex-membership, plays a far from insignificant role in
Irigary's usage). In undertaking this work, she aims to counter the
knowledge that we claim of these notions on the basis of their current
circulation in language. Appealing to a Saussirian model, we could say
that t[he transparency of this common-sense or normal language (parole)
is guaranteed by an underlying and pre-existing grammar (language), and
that is what Irigaray is calling for in response to this state of
affairs is 'an examination of the operation of the "grammar" of each
figure of discourse, its syntactic laws or requirements, its imaginary
configurations, its metaphorical networks']{.underline} (Irigaray 1985a:
75; Chanter 1995: 240). [This move aims to liberate our thinking of the
body from the grasp of biologic naturalism which reduces the sexual
difference of sexed bodies to their essential physical
characteristics.]{.underline} [The task then becomes that of the
reappropriation of the female body on the basis of sexual difference,
for a political revolution in thought, through a refoundation of
conceptuality -- otherwise than according to phallo-mimetic
masculinism]{.underline}. In the absence of any conventional names for
this project of writing, which Irigaray herself is evidently not so
directly concerned to name, I have elsewhere proposed the term
'labia-tropocentrism' (Boothroyd, 1996). This term represents an attempt
to respond to her emphase on the female sex/genitals (sexe), the 'lips'
(les levres), and to their synechdochical and catachretic figuring in
her account of the female sex (sexe) (Gallop 1990: 97).

### 1NC -- Link - Overkill

#### The aff's description of trans overkill serves as semiotic terror against trans and genderqueer. Due to the unpredictable, yet inevitable encounter with grotesque encounter with trans and genderqueer death acts as structural trauma that the 1AC actively invests in.

[The first time I heard about]{.underline} the shooting at the
[Pulse]{.underline} nightclub in Orlando, Florida[, was through a
text]{.underline} message conversation. The message was [from a dear
friend who knew that I had taken the last five months off of
Facebook]{.underline} and prob ably hadn't heard the news. [Getting off
of Facebook played a major part in my recovery from **depression, which
had emerged in part due to the repeated trauma of experiencing media
depictions of violence against trans and black people in my newsfeed**.
Many of my most intimate, significant life events are filtered through
algorithmic media, occurring on digital communication platforms,
time-stamped and arranged]{.underline} on highly designed mobile
interfaces. [These range from text message break-ups to Skype
conversations with lovers, from watching my nephew grow up on Facebook
to learning about deaths in my communities. This brief text-message
exchange was followed by waves of grief. I read articles; I watched
video clips]{.underline}; and I went to the Black Power Epicenter, a
healing space for queer and trans people of color. There, after many of
the people present shared their feelings, cried, and sang, it was the
DJ's rhythms that allowed us to shift our affect from slowly rocking
grief to cathartic, connecting movement. [These days, I am
splintered---shattered by sadness, shock, and fear---**from news of
events that come in an irregular, but inexorable, rhythm.**]{.underline}
This poetic/performative essay is an effort to bring that rhythm to life
and to reflect upon its significance by consid ering the relationship
between visibility and affect and how the digital acts as a medium for
flows between, through, and across both[. Our necropolitical moment is
one in which horrific stories of the murders of people in our
communities and families come to us daily through networked media. If
the primary tool of biopolitics was the census, perhaps we can consider
the paradigmatic tool of necropolitics to be the algorithm.]{.underline}
In his essay "Necropolitics," philosopher Achille [Mbembe]{.underline}
describes necropolitical war machines as "polymorphous and diffuse
organizations," which include "sensors aboard un manned air vehicles
(UAVs) \... an Earth-observation satellite, \[and\] techniques of
'hologrammization," and which perpetrate "invisible killing."1 He
[describes a contemporary moment in which visibility is complex,
shifting, and automated, and often occurs because individuals are being
targeted for violence]{.underline}. Alg[orithms deliver death coolly,
emotionlessly, through coded, logical decisions. The emo tional and
affective impacts of our lives unfold around the contours of these
digital, time-stamped moments. Algorithms manage visibility on social
media, but their reach extends much farther than tha]{.underline}t. As
Mbembe mentions, [the UAVs (also known as drones) that are used daily in
the United States' racialized War on Terror also function by way of
software. Algorithms, encoded in software and in the hardware of
electronic circuits, manage the decisions of who lives and who dies
under necropolitics. This reality continues to expand: numerous gov
ernments have begun to purchase robots to be armed with lethal weapons
and used for policing, and the number of cities employing the algorithms
of predic tive policing, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and
Miami, continues to grow.2 In July 2016, Micah Johnson, who allegedly
shot and killed five police officers at a #BlackLivesMatter rally in
Dallas, became the first civilian known to have been killed by a police
robot]{.underline}.3 In the days that followed the Orlando attack, I
learned that the shooting occurred during Latinx night at Pulse and that
there were transgender women at the club. For the past year, in response
to earlier shootings of black trans women, I had been working on a
project called Unstoppable, which aims to create bullet proof clothing
for trans women; in the aftermath of this attack, I wished that my work
had been more effective. The dramatic increase in visibility for trans
women of color in 2014 was followed by a significant increase in the
number of murders of trans women in 2015. Unstoppable grew out of this
reality, in the summer of 2015, as a collaboration with Patrisse
Cullors, cofounder of #BlackLivesMatter, Chris Head, an artist with whom
I had collaborated previously, and Ecbcie Betts, an artist-activist in
Los Angeles. The project is an expression of solidarity be tween black
people and trans women, stemming from a feeling of shared ur gency.
Inspired by Cullors's collaboration with artist-activists Damon Turner
and Foremost on a clothing line called #Bulletproof, Cullors, Head,
Betts, and I began to research methods and materials to create
affordable bulletproof clothing. To date, our results have been
inconclusive. Our testing has revealed that some used tires can stop 9mm
bullets, but only when the tires are layered eight deep. We have also
found that some airbags, salvaged from wrecked and abandoned cars, are
made out of Kevlar, a fabric that is said to be bulletproof when piled
twelve layers deep. We have also learned that some cutting boards made
of ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) plastic may stop low-caliber
bullets, but we have not yet determined which brands use this material.
Our research continues and is available at weRunstoppable.com.
Unstoppable is a project that began by acknowledging that visibility is
not enough to keep us safe[. Mourning for the forty-nine people murdered
at Pulse, I felt my own ineffectiveness and wished I had the resistant
algorithm to share with people]{.underline}, the steps necessary to turn
junk into lifesaving bulletproof armor. But we don't have it yet. [As
this train of thought continued, I knew that it was a way of avoiding
the underlying grief I felt for the victims and survivors of the
shooting, to whom I felt closer given what I imagined were our shared
experi ences as queer and trans Latinx people---an identification that
is an assemblage of many widely differing experiences.]{.underline} By
studying the effects of digital media, I have explained elsewhere that
algorithmic analysis extends the assemblage model.4 Theorist Jasbir K.
Puar has argued that Kimberlé Crenshaw's intersectional model of
structural oppression can be usefully extended with Gilles Deleuze and
Felix Guattari's concept of assemblage to incorporate relationships
between many axes of oppression that change over time.5 I have also
argued that the assemblage model introduces am biguity and that the
mathematical basis of assemblages can be modeled through algorithms.
Further, I [claim that algorithms, understood most simply as a list of
ingredients and a series of steps, are uniquely suited to the
understanding of oppression today as it is managed by digital
technologies. Here, I engage in affec tive and algorithmic analyses of a
few moments of time in the months of June and July 2016, during which
extreme violence against trans, black, and Latinx people occurred
repeatedly, rhythmically]{.underline}. T[heorizing violence against
queer peo ple of color as queer necropolitics]{.underline}, Puar states
that it "[entails the increasingly anatomic, sensorial, and tactile
subjugation of bodies---whether those of the detained of Guantánamo Bay
or the human waste of refugees, evacuees, the liv ing dead, the dead
living, the decaying living, those living slow deaths---it moves beyond
identitarian and visibility frames of queerness to address questions of
ontology and affect]{.underline}."6 [Her formulation is particularly
important to considerations of trans of color politics in the wake of
the increased violence that has coincided with increased
visibility]{.underline}. The time stamps on significant moments in our
lives unfold multiple mean ings through algorithmic considerations. Time
stamps may conjure images from science fiction (such as the way Star
Trek episodes were each introduced by a "Captain's log star-date"),
pre-digital epistolary fiction, or the precision of scientific
experiments. And yet[, the presence of digital media time stamps goes
beyond a desire to record personal experiences; it reveals the way our
communi cations are stored in databases for future use]{.underline} by
entities that are not us. These databases are often relational, based on
Structured Query Language (SQL), it self a kind of algorithm. [They
house our memories, words, winks, and emojis, and are owned by
corporations such as Verizon, Apple, Facebook, and Tumbir. Through a
simple friend request on Facebook, one has access to information that
maps another's affects through time, and often their geolocation stamps
as well.]{.underline} In the browser-based Javascript programming
language that is the basis for most interactivity on the web today,
there is an Application Programming Interface (API) called Geolocation,
which makes it easy to request and record time and location data
together as one object---Position.timestamp---which in cludes GPS
coordinates and a time stamp with precision to the millisecond.7 An
algorithmic analysis could be performed by writing software to map
affects from one's Facebook page over time and place, or one could use
Facebook's Graph API to map the speed at which an affect travels
geographically, by tracking posts about a particular violent event and
doing a sentiment analysis on the words in the posts. [To imagine what
an algorithmic analysis might map, I only have to consider a brief
sampling of my Facebook friends' responses to the video released online
of the murder of Alton Sterling, a black man shot multiple times by
Louisiana police]{.underline} while being held on the ground.8 [These
responses included a range of affects such as grief, shock, anger,
frustration, and numbness.]{.underline} In "Shame in the Cybernetic
Fold," queer theorists Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Adam Frank discuss the
complex layerings and crossings of digital and analog phenomena in the
work of Silvan Tomkins, who developed early affect theory. They state
that "the tacit homology machine: digital :: animal: analogical (and
concomitant privi leging of the machine/digital) is \... a very powerful
structuring presumption for current theory and emerges especially
strongly as a reflexive antibiologism. But it represents bad engineering
and bad biology, and it leads to bad theory \... the distinction between
digital and analog is anything but absolute."9 According to Sedgwick and
Frank, one way of understanding affect is to think of it as an ana log
phenomenon, because there is a one-to-many relationship between a stimu
lus and the resulting affect. An example of this kind of relationship is
Tomkins's experiment documenting many different responses to the same
stimulus of an electric shock. Affect moves through space and time in
gradations of intensity that increase and dissipate, and time stamps can
mark that movement. Trans studies scholar [Che Gossett, reflecting on
the Orlando massacre]{.underline} in an article titled "Pulse, Beat,
Rhythm, Cry: Orlando and the queer and trans necropolitics of loss and
mourn ing," [calls attention to the centrality of the beat: "Anti
queer/trans necropolitical violence is about stopping the pulse of queer
and trans of color life/worlds and the club was a target because the
club is a flashpoint for eroticopoliticized desire."° A pulse is a
biological indicator of life; it can also be a pulse of light in a
fiber-optic cable carrying digital communications, or the pulse of a
strobe light on the dance floor, moving with a beat.]{.underline}
FRIDAY, JUNE 24TH, 2016, AT 12:13AM I've begun to slowly reintroduce
Facebook into my life in controlled ways, check ing it once every few
days or once a day at most. Opening Facebook in my web browser, I am
presented with a newsfeed. One method of algorithmic analysis is the
common hacking method of reverse engineering. The algorithm for my
newsfeed may be composed of the following steps, and may contain other
steps made invisible by the technology of server-side web content
processing: 1. Find the list of my friends 2. Find posts from my friends
in the last twenty-four hours 3. Sort by time stamp, number of likes,
and number of comments 4. Adjust the sort according to any additional
algorithms for relevance, such as inserting posts which have been paid
for, or adjusting users' feeds to alter their emotions---thereby
producing data for a study on how emotions are contagious, which
Facebook denies was tied to the US government11 5. Display as many of
the sorted posts as will fit on the screen; store the rest in order in
case of scrolling [In my feed, I see an image of a gender nonconforming
person with a bloodied face. The experience is quick, without a
conscious choice on my part. The caption tells me that this person is
trans and that they were attacked leaving a benefit for the "Orlando 49"
in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood---just minutes from where I
live---an area of the city I frequent multiple times a week. This is too
much. I didn't want to see this now. I often scroll past these posts
when I am not in an emotional state in which I can handle them. I often
feel numb when I see them and, sometimes, will slightly dissociate.
Perhaps this is a privilege that I exercise---to not think about these
violent acts until I am ready to---or perhaps it is a survival mechanism
and a form of emotional intelligence that I have built up in order to
withstand the repeated murders of people close to me, in my com munity,
and in communities like mine. Facebook and other social media
corporations profit off of every click and every scroll. Contemporary
social movements' usage of these platforms to spread data benefits the
information economy that sells users' demographic data to advertisers,
who pay per thousands of impressions and per click. Each death that is
posted about on social media keeps users scrolling and clicking, increas
ing revenue for these corporations; they very literally profit off of
our deaths, our mourning, our communication, the spread of our
affects]{.underline}. In his essay "Subject(ed) to Recognition,"
professor Herman Gray writes of the ways that neo liberalism has
incorporated difference into a profit-making mechanism, stating:
\[W\]ith the proliferation of representations made possible by new media
technologies and distribution platforms, will the intensity, variety,
and reach of representations of race or ethnicity, gender or sexuality
that daily crisscross the Internet challenge and destabilize the
structure and cultural dispositions of identity, self, community,
belonging, and politics to which we have become so accustomed? [I side
with critiques of rep resentation that doubt that merely seeing more
members of heretofore aggrieved and excluded communities in the media
will increase access to life chances.]{.underline}'2 Gray articulates
the way that the diversity of representations in digital media not only
benefits global capitalism but is fundamental to it. He describes in
detail the role of technology in managing velocity and difference in
order to generate profit, saying, "\[t\]he capacity to detect and
respond to the slightest variation or shift in global markets, finance,
and trade, where the difference between growth and stagnation means
global financial crisis, is built on speed and differentiation."1'
Algorithms, such as those responsible for high-frequency trading of
stocks by the millisecond, facilitate the control of different elements
at speeds that far exceed human cognition.14 Gray's intervention
highlights the blurred lines between the hegemonic power of corporations
that control digital media and the struggle of people working for social
justice, pointing out that "the alliance of difference and power
instigates a yearning for representation as an end in itselfthat
perfectly expresses the logic of market choice, consumer sovereignty,
self-reliance, and cultural diversity. In short, [the incitement to
media visibility and the proliferation of me dia images that it
generates is a technique of power."]{.underline}15 Gray's critique
echoes Sedgwick and Frank's turn to affect as a means to avoid simple
binaries that result from misinterpretations of Michel Foucault's
repressive hypothesis and always reduce their objects to "binarized,
highly moralistic allegories of the sub versive versus the hegemonic,
resistance versus power."16 [The harm that people cause one another
through the spread of affects such as shock, grief, and numb ness on
social media is an example of how the lines of subversion/resistance
versus hegemony/power are not so clear. When allies of transgender
people post violent images and videos of trans people's murders, they
sometimes are harming the very communities they intend to aid by not
considering who the audience is for their posts, or by not considering
carefully how that media will be distributed. My claim here is not
intended to continue the trend of disparag ing allies, as I believe that
solidarity is essential to advancing social justice; this critique also
applies to trans people, people of color, and others engaging in the
sharing of media when it is done carelessly]{.underline}. Rather, my
intent is to urge that more care be taken to consider how affect is
spread on social media, who is af fected, and for whose benefit.

## 1NC - Impacts

### 1NC -- Impact -- Grammar

#### The inadequacy of the aff's method to fail to account for the fact that women can never be understood as a subject within conventional Western systems means that it is impossible for anyone to be a sex or a gender. Gender relations are told through the hegemonic, masculine language of the squo, which displaces the woman as the Other. 

**Butler 90 (Judith Butler, 1990, "Gender Trouble", pgs. 18-19,**
[[http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf]{.underline}](http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf))//AR

The various explanatory models offered here suggest the very different
ways in which the category of sex is understood depending on how the
field of power is articulated. Is it possible to maintain the complexity
of these fields o power and think through their productive capacities
together? On the one hand, Irigaray's theory of sexual difference
suggests that [women can never be understood on the model of a "subject"
within the conventional representational systems of Western culture
precisely because they constitute the fetish of representation and,
hence, the unrepresentable as such.]{.underline} [Women can never "be",
according to this ontology of substances, precisely because]{.underline}
[they are the relation of difference, the excluded, by which that domain
marks itself off. Women are also a "difference" that cannot be
understood as the simple negotiation or "Other" of the
always-already-masculine subject. As discussed earlier, they are neither
the subject nor its Other, but a difference from the economy of binary
opposition, itself a ruse for the monologic elaboration of the
masculine]{.underline}. Central to each of these views, however, is the
notion [that sex appears within hegemonic language as a substance, as,
metaphysically speaking, a self-identical being.]{.underline} [This
appearance is achieved through a performative twist of language and/or
discourse that conceals the fact that "being" a sex or gender is
fundamentally impossible]{.underline}. For Irigara, grammar can never be
a true index of gender relations precisely because it supports the
substantial mode of gender as a binary relation between two positive and
representable terms. In Irigaray's view[, the substantive grammar of
gender, which assumes men and women as well as their attributes of
masculine and feminine is an example of a binary that effectively masks
the univocal and hegemonic discourse of the masculine, phallogocentrism,
silencing the feminine as a site of subversive
multiplicity.]{.underline} For Foucault, the substantive grammar of sex
imposes an artificial binary relation between the sexes, as well an
artificial internal coherence within each term of that binary. The
binary regulation of sexuality suppresses the subversive multiplity of a
sexuality that disrupts heterosexual, reproductive and medicojuridical
hegemonies.

## 1NC - Alternative

### [1NC -- Alt - Abolition]{.underline}

#### We must engage in a prison-industrial-complex abolitionist politic -- we can no longer be reflective and backed into the neoliberal trap facing anti-trans violence. Material engagement with and making demands of institutions is the only way to create safer spaces

YVE LARIS COHEN: This spring one of my trans students at the Cooper
Union organized a panel called "Black Femme Power" featuring black
transfeminine or ganizer and abolitionist Joshua Allen. This student,
Rio Sofia, along with a core group of fellow trans students and their
cis accomplices, had just won a long and difficult battle with the
school administration to degenderize campus restrooms. [At one point
during the panel, Allen spoke about the difference between radical
strategies for trans liberation rooted in abolitionism and rights-based
neoliberal projects focused on trans visibility. In the same breath as
talking about trans inclusion in the military, Allen listed "bathrooms"
as one such neoliberal concern. It was a quick mention---Allen didn't
elaborate or revisit it later in conversation--- but a meaningful
one.]{.underline} I recoiled a bit and could sense some discomfort among
the passionate student bathroom organizers in the audience. I
defensively thought through how working for bathroom safety for trans
folks was so very different from imploring the Pentagon to participate
in US imperialism. I then paused to ex amine how my position as a white
transmasculine person mediated this defensive thinking. [The bathroom is
one of the primary sites where I've experienced violence as a trans
person]{.underline}; I haven't been incarcerated or deported or
homeless, for example. [I can see how bathroom accessibility might be a
very low or non-priority for many of my transfeminine and people of
color comrades who experience regular, systemic threats to their lives
through many other vectors. Additionally, waging an all-gender restroom
campaign almost invariably in volves heavy engagement with an
institution---be it a school, a museum, or a local
government]{.underline}. In many cases, heavy engagement means heavy
begging (e.g., "Please allocate resources in next year's budget to build
an all-gender restroom with wheelchair accessibility"). The intersection
with disability is important and another reason why I was resistant to
characterizing bathroom organizing as a neoliberal endeavor. [During my
teenage years as a queer youth organizer in the early 2000s, I
strategically formed coalitions with disabled teens to fight for the
building or remodeling of bathrooms to be both ADA-compliant and
gender-neutral. High school administrations were much more responsive to
demands for accessible all-gender restrooms when threatened with a
lawsuit for noncompliance with landmark national
legislation.]{.underline} This work was a formative experience in
shaping my thinking around how transness is entangled with disability,
or crip experience---how trans liberation must be cripped and crip
liberation must be transed. In the 1990s and early 2000s, trans bathroom
organizing wasn't entwined with mainstream trans visibility and media
representation in the way it's now become so deeply enmeshed in less
than a year's time. [We used to be on the offense, pushing for lasting
architectural changes to our institutions. Now, anti-trans bathroom
legislation is a de facto legal avenue for conservatives to go after us.
And this is where we find ourselves in a neoliberal trap. We're on the
defensive, asserting our right to use whichever existing gendered
bathroom "fits" us best. The bathroom fight is no longer about willing a
radical futurity, building new spaces for our shit and cum and piss that
look and feel different from the old ones.]{.underline} We're assuring
lawmakers and voters that we---particularly transwomen, who are always
on the front lines---are not a threat to the safety of cis children in
these shitty existing bathrooms. "Safety" has always been about the
maintenance of white supremacy. [This is where I turn back to my
incredible Cooper students and how abolition can lend the bathroom
effort a radical break. At several points over the course of the
two-and-a-half-year battle, administrators offered the student
organizers a number of concessions: more single-stall all-gender
bathrooms or opening up some all-gender faculty restrooms to students.
The organizers didn't yield. The point had always been to remove all
gender designations from all restrooms in the entire institution, rather
than designating auxiliary "safer spaces" for trans and gender
nonconforming students, faculty, and staff. This is abolition
thinking.]{.underline} It's not incidental that several of these
students are active in prison and police abolition work, such as Freedom
To Live (F2 L). [It wasn't about reforming or upgrading or lessening the
pain---it was about freeing everyone, cis and trans alike, from the
oppressive architecture of gendered facilities]{.underline}. BARROW: I
am an abolitionist because I am committed to self-determination. The
ways in which the social, cultural, political, economic, and, I think we
can add, technological sectors intersect to control the ideas, values,
and mobility of the body politic form a violent carceral landscape that
exists within our neighbor hoods, households, institutions, and
imaginations. **[I think an abolitionist process is both active and
reflective. It is internal and external; it is within the "between
space." State violence (perpetuated by police, prisons, jails, mental
asylums, courts, and surveillance) works in accord with every other
sector of systemic oppression--- education, housing, finance, business,
health, media, planning \... There is no skirting the existence of this
behemoth]{.underline}**. [A prison-industrial-complex abolitionist
politic is, at its core, a politic that is in direct contradiction to
systemic oppression. **We cannot reform the system; it is a system that
must be dismantled**.]{.underline} Similarly, systemic oppression cannot
exist without an agreement from the body politic. In what ways are we
complicit with our own oppression? I think that to practice an
abolitionist praxis requires that we work to decolonize our
imaginations, push ourselves beyond borders, and demand aspirational
thinking from ourselves and from each other. [How do we provide safety
for ourselves without calling on outside forces? How are we sustaining
ourselves economically to prevent the intrusions of the state into our
neighborhoods, communities, households, and minds? Where are these
models? I think abolitionists have to keep asking ourselves these
questions, compiling documentation, archiving the hell out of stuff,
using all of the platforms available to us, and hunkering down \...It's
rough out here!]{.underline}

### [1NC -- Alt -]{.underline} Fugitivity

#### The alternative is gender fugitivity via embracing trans\*ness as a political subjectivity. Embodying trans\*ness, distinct from identifying as transgender, places a demand on us as subjects to theorize wholly inclusive and material modes of stopping the enmeshed modes of power that oppress all who are marked/identify as gender deviant. 

**Bey and Green 17 (**Marquis Bey is a PhD candidate in the English

So yes, [the centering of Black "women"]{.underline} (again, this is a
troubled term, especially rubbing so close to the gender trouble that is
Blackness) [in conversations surrounding feminism and the operative
gender category of "woman" was in many ways meant to critique that very
term]{.underline}---to whom it actually refers in our imaginary, to what
and whose ends is the term deployed, in what situations is the term
deployed. ["\[T\]he 'Black woman]{.underline},'" L.H. Stallings writes
in Mutha' Is Half a Word, a phenomenal examination of the "unnaming"
processes of Black women, radical Black female sexuality, and Black
queer desires, "[represents an invented character by cultures not of her
own making ... the term unsuccessfully attempts to join the narratives
of woman (white) with that of Black (man)."]{.underline}9 [In critiquing
the notions of "Black" and specifically, initially "woman," Black women,
in effect, put a pressure on it that questioned its very nominal and
social status and sought to alter the very foundations and assumptions
upon which the racially solipsistic category of "woman"
rested.]{.underline} You touch on something really important: [the
simultaneous urge to disrupt and change these limited and limiting
categories we use to identify ourselves, and to hold them close to us
because it is by virtue of these categories that we exist as subjects;
we are subjectivated by these categories, so to do away with them
entirely would be to feel as though we have lost ourselves]{.underline}.
But [I sometimes wonder if this is the aim, to lose ourselves, to
cultivate liveable space in the losing of ourselves. Might the nexus of
Black feminism and trans feminism be an enabling provocation for
un/racial, un/gendered "thought and existence otherwise, an otherwise
than being," a **shadethrowing deployable problem for thought that names
a force rather than physical characteristic?**10 Could that be a place
to live?]{.underline} This is a genuine and open question that I really
want to invite to be interrogated. KMG: One of my favorite quotations is
from D.L. Smith's essay, "What is Black Culture?" where he writes,
"[**Perhaps in losing ourselves, we will find
ourselves**."]{.underline}11 [We are made into subjects through
processes of imprint upon bodies, identity]{.underline}; race, gender,
class, and/or sexual orientations. [Without these identities, we fear
that we will lose some sense of ourselves that is bound to history, so
we carry it (history), sometimes by choice and other times, identities
are placed upon us from the world around us and we have no real choice
in how others choose to perceive us]{.underline} or our embodied
histories. The fact of the matter is that we know that [just because you
are poor doesn't mean that you will have radical anti-capitalist
politics.]{.underline} Just because you are Black doesn't mean that you
will somehow have an affinity towards or with other Black people. [These
identities are scripts and the people who carry these scripts in their
body, or rather those who embody evidence of particular identities,
constantly prove how categorical labels are always already, they be,
incapable of articulating the fullness of we (subjects) who endure,
challenge, reinforce, despise, love, and sometimes encourage the naming.
This limit does not exist simply because of a failure to acknowledge
intersectional identities that many people carry]{.underline}, that is,
a Black transgender working class woman---we could continue to add on
here bisexual, college educated, Latinx, Republican---[all of these
identity claims start to help you understand the fullness of a subject,
but none of these give you the full subject even if we keep listing out
all of the identities we hold, we will only ever be approaching the
fullness of a being or subject]{.underline} as said being changes in and
over time. So I think [the fear that we will lose ourselves without
these categories is a trap that keeps us holding on to categories that
we know fail us.]{.underline} [There is a bind though because these
identity categories prove useful in garnering state recognition, and
also in creating a sense of community]{.underline} or group affinity.
[Think of the notion of a "protected class" that describes persons who
are supposedly protected by the law because of their
identity]{.underline}, but these anti-discrimination laws don't always
work to protect the people they set out to protect. [While most hate
crimes are still committed on Black bodies, it is LGBT \[lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender\] (white) folk who are most evoked when
thinking of hate crimes]{.underline} and we are usually thinking about
white queer bodies.12 For example, [a recent episode of Law and Order
SVU]{.underline}, "Transgender Bridge,"13 [centers on the story of a
white transgender teenage girl who is taunted by high schoolers
from]{.underline} another school, [a Black school,]{.underline} and an
altercation ensues on the bridge after school. [The Black boy pushes the
girl and she falls over the bridge]{.underline}. She survives the
initial fall, but later dies because of complications from the fall.
Over the course of the episode, the Black boy keeps being reminded that
he didn't just hurt anyone, but someone from a "protected class[." The
viewer isn't supposed to be able to see or hold that the Black boy is
also a part of a class that needs protecting.]{.underline} This kind of
nuance would disrupt and make unstable the position of the white
transgender girl as the proper "protected class." [The Black boy is
sentenced to 7 years, 3 years in a juvenile facility, and upon his 18th
birthday he'll be transferred to an adult prison]{.underline} to serve
the remainder. [In order to be able to view the nuance of the above
situation it requires what I call a trans\* positionality or
lens]{.underline}. For me, **[there is a difference between trans and
transgender.]{.underline}** [Transgender people are all very different
so there isn't one thing that I can say about Black transgender people.
Being Black and transgender doesn't give a person the ability to
redeploy strategies of feminism. There are Black transgender people who
do that work, but there are others who do not. I think what is more
useful is to think about the ways in which trans\*, like blackness, can
be embodied, but **it actually marks a certain kind of orientation in
the world, it is not fixed though always precarious.**]{.underline} [It
is important to make this distinction between transgender and trans
because many transgender people do not identify as transgender, but
rather identify as man or woman, not asking to remake or add a new
gender category, but rather fit into one that already
exists]{.underline}. In this case, I would not say that transgender
people are actually undoing the categories that produce the boundaries
of a gender binary, though changing one's location on the binary does
challenge the notion that gender is fixed, because some people are able
to change genders. I think [what might be more useful in this
conversation is to think about gender nonconforming bodies, bodies that
do not fit and actively refute a binary legibility. Not because these
people are necessarily more radical, but their existence often poses a
critique to the gender-binaried-order of the land. I believe it is
necessary to cultivate a politic that is able to view the ways in which
certain bodies are made more vulnerable to certain kinds of violence,
but to also note that vulnerability changes depending on time, place,
and condition.]{.underline} In the latest essay I published I propose
trans\*: [We must listen for the fullness embedded in the silences and
gaps, the moments of existence before the name or the category came to
do its work upon the body. We must be more attuned to the present
absences which calls for a Trans\* method.]{.underline} One of the ways
in which Black Queer Studies scholars have challenged us to engage black
sexuality and gender is through simultaneous black and queer acts of
(re)membering. Black Queer Studies staged this work in the gap and in
the silence of Queer Studies and Black Studies who articulated
themselves as mutually exclusive. [Black Queer Studies helped us to call
out the missing, the ones who are with us, but neglected. A Trans\*
method further names the work of charting the present absences in
multiple sites of intersection by demanding a moment of critical
presence. **A Trans\* method is a tool that helps us to embark upon the
work of listening, understanding, and reading as both intellectual and
political practices.** It allows us to see certain things that might not
normally be seen. It also helps us to understand how that seeing is
being shaped.]{.underline} MB: I like the distinction you're making
between transgender people and gender nonconforming bodies. [One can
identify and be identified as transgender and yet do little to subvert
and disrupt the gender binary.]{.underline} I imagine, maybe, [you'd say
something similar about those who are epidermally read as
Black]{.underline}? That is, [one can identify and be identified as
Black and do little to undermine white supremacy.]{.underline} We can
name a whole host of racially and gender marginalized folks who do not
do Black feminist or trans feminist work, as it were: suffragists who
said that they'd "cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work
or demand the ballot for the Negro and not the woman"; Hotep dudes
pontificating about their "African Queens" and demanding babies, babies,
babies because birth control is "genocide"; Southern African American
men with swastika tattoos and confederate flags on their pick-ups;
far-Right transgender women who buttress the gender binary; African
American women who chastised "their" men for not being "manly" enough to
defend "the race." Surely [subjectivity is complex and perhaps we all
harbor instances of hegemonic practices. I think I want to maintain,
though, that the Black/trans/feminist work to be done rests not in what
we purportedly are but in how we mobilize ourselves and our politics in
subversion of power. The terms at hand, then, come to be tied, for us,
to relations to power and a willingness to enact the political forces
behind these terms. In other words, we must choose Black and trans and
feminism; we must make these things mean and matter in politically
liberatory ways]{.underline}. I think [**I yearn for the thing that
flows from the meeting of Black feminism and trans feminism as
gendered** fugitivity. The Blackness and transness of feminisms are not
distinct phenomena to be hierarchized, nor mutually exclusive modes of
subjectivity; Blackness and transness both engender animacy, act as
analytical sites of disruption, and imbricate one another to the end of
excavating the interstices of categorization]{.underline}. General
Articles 445 And [I want to be clear that the political valences of the
language I choose to deploy with respect to the Blackness and transness
of feminisms must be handled with care. This conversation is testament
to the fact that we care a great deal.]{.underline} And it is because we
care a great deal that we are asserting these positions. [We care
about---nay, we love---the deviant, the marginalized, the fugitive, the
renegades, the rebels, the gender-benders, the queer. These are the ones
with whom I want to be. **I want to be in sociality with them because
they are, to me, seeking to actualize radical politics, mastering the
refusal of mastery.**]{.underline}

### [1NC -- Alt -- **Merographic method**]{.underline}

#### **The alternative is to deploy merographic methods in order to detach parts of the body from the whole -- by using the merographic method we can reconceptualize transness outside the logic of gender**

**Jack Halberstam (2016**) Trans\* - Gender Transitivity and New
Configurations of Body, History, Memory and Kinship, Parallax, 22:3,
366-375, DOI: 10.1080/13534645.2016.1201925

If, as Keeling's work has shown, [bodies often exceed the apparatuses
(medical, cinematic, narrative or social) available to represent them,
what methods should we use to track the disorderly histories of trans\*?
Perhaps we need to deploy 'merographic methods']{.underline} to make
sense of the shifting nature of trans\* identifications over time.
Anthropologist Marilyn Strathern coined the term 'merographic method'
while writing about English kinship in her famous study After Nature. 11
Strathern herself in the introduction to Partial Connections explains
the function of this method in terms of always 'thinking about what is
implicit or explicit or about what is hidden or made visible? Building
upon this idea that rather than thinking about connections, analogies,
what is the same or what is different about bodies, [we should also be
attentive to the partial and arbitrary nature of all description and
theory and to the complex interactions between people and technology,
human bodies and other non-human animal forms, scales and intensities.
Sarah Franklin, who is strongly influenced by Strathern's work describes
the merographic method as the revelation of logics that remain hidden by
processes of comparison and as the disconnection of parts from wholes.13
Refusing the logic of the whole, parts can be reconfigured within a
merographic method to mean something different, something new. The
refusal to see parts as merely a micro articulation of the whole offers
us the possibility of seeing trans\* bodies differently -- not as bodies
out of sync with the gender logics of their social environments, but
potentially as bodies whose parts, particularly their genitalia but also
their musculature, their fleshy areas, their protrusions and their
flatness, their parts that hang and their parts that retract, all mean
something other than the logic of gender dictates. While such a concept
of gender is hard to access in the autobiographical accounts of
'becoming a woman' or 'becoming a man', it emerges in fits and starts in
the visual texts I turn to next. Seeing trans\* bodies]{.underline}
differently then -- not simply as trans bodies that provide an image of
the non-normative against which normative bodies can be discerned -- but
[as bodies that are fragmentary and internally contradictory, bodies
that remap gender and its relations to race, place, class and sexuality,
bodies that are in pain or that represent a play of surfaces, bodies
that sound different from the way they look, bodies that represent
palimpsestic relations to identity, means finding different visual,
aural and haptic codes and systems through which to figure the
experience of being in a body]{.underline}

### [1NC -- Alt --]{.underline} Dwell in irreducibility

#### The alternative is for women to accept the irreducibility of themselves in relation to universality. Women's sexuality and women's speech cannot be explained by the masculine imaginary in the status quo, which means that if you vote aff, you will continue to allow the masculine imaginary to dominate the discourse of the politics of sexual difference. 

**Poe 11 (Danielle Poe, 2011, Professor of Philosophy at the University
of Dayton, Ohio, "Can Luce Irigaray's Notion of Sexual Difference be
Applied to Transsexual and Transgender Narratives?",**
[[https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=phl_fac_pub]{.underline}](https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=phl_fac_pub),
pgs. 114-115)///AR

As early as Speculum of the Other Woman, lrigaray turns her attention to
an analysis of women\'s bodies (1985 \[1974\]). In \"Irigaray\'s Body
Symbolic,\" Margaret Whitford draws our attention to the importance of
the lips and mucous as a metaphor in lrigaray\'s work that can provide a
model of divinity, sexuality, and speech that are proper to establishing
sexual difference. [For Whitford, lrigaray\'s focus on lips and mucous
provides a means of thinking about ethics as relational instead of
hierarchical. In this model for ethics, the sensible is emphasized such
that ethics relates to the here and now rather than to a static,
universal definition]{.underline}. As something that is more accessible
to touch than sight, mucous can only be accessed in the sensible.
[Mucous is at the threshold of the lips and signifies an openness, a
refusal to close women into some fixed definition defined by patriarchy.
**Whitford also argues that mucous corresponds to women\'s sexuality and
women\'s speech. Mucous can never be reduced to a part, or an object;
therefore, mucous is not easily incorporated in the masculine imaginary.
Mucous is not part of "a binary opposition; it touches and flows between
that which it touches**]{.underline} (Whitford 1991). If we take
Whitford\'s analysis further, we notice that Irigaray\'s discussion of
mucous and its importance never occurs separately from her discussion of
the importance of the lips: [A remaking of immanence and transcendence,
notably through this threshold which has never been examined as such:
the female sex. The threshold that gives access to the
mucous]{.underline}. Beyond classical oppositions of love and hate,
liquid and ice-a threshold that is always half-open. The threshold of
the lips, which are strangers to dichotomy and oppositions. Gathered one
against the other but without any possible suture, at least of a real
kind. [They do not absorb the world into or through themselves, provided
they are not misused and reduced to a means of consumption or
consummation. They offer a shape of welcome but do not assimilate,
reduce, or swallow up.]{.underline} (Irigaray 1993 \[1984\], 18,
emphasis in original) lrigaray\'s analysis focuses on both the facial
lips and the genital lips. The relation of lips to themselves is one in
which the touching-touched relation cannot be distinguished. The lips
are both touched and touching. [While some might argue that lrigaray\'s
attention to women\'s lips is feature of essentialism in which a woman
is a woman based on her genitalia, we can instead understand her focus
on the lips as a rejoinder to Freud and Lacan\'s insistence that woman
is an absence, absence of the penis and absence of the
phallus.]{.underline} The lips are material and different than the
penis. Yet, the lips are not a static category; the lips function
differently in different circumstances. lrigaray emphasizes that lips
both welcome and limit our relationships. For Irigaray, [ethics is not
simply about what one is permitted to do, but also how one is limited by
the other]{.underline} **(Irigaray 2001 \[1997\], 33-37).** [In
welcoming and limiting the other, the ethical model demands first of all
that a woman can speak for herself. For Irigaray, a woman speaks for
herself by virtue of situating herself in relation to her sex and to the
limit of her sex.]{.underline} [She says, in fact, I am created by two
genders and I live in a mixed community.]{.underline} But let us
consider a utopia of our age: a woman gives birth to a woman, and they
live in a community of women separated from the other part of the world.
A woman in such a situation should consider her identity as woman as an
identity in relationship with the other gender, at least insofar as it
is her intention to fulfill her own gender. There is in me, woman, a
part that is negative, not realizable by me alone, a part of night, a
part that is reserved, a part that is irreducibly feminine and that is
not suited to represent the whole of the human being that must enter
into the constitution of my identity (34). [Even for the woman who is
born to another woman and who lives only with other women, this
woman-among-women is still characterized by the part of her that cannot
represent all of humanity. Thus, this woman does not become woman by
\"not being a man\" since she has never been exposed to men. Rather, she
becomes woman by recognizing her own irreducibility and her own
inability to represent every human.]{.underline} [In this case,
irreducibility has to do with her irreducibility as a single individual,
who does not represent all women and is not represented by all women.
Thus, lrigaray\'s claims about irreducibility include a means to
preserve individuals\' concreteness in relation to the universal. But,
to fulfill her relationship to the universal, woman must consider her
identity in relation to the identity of men. Her relation to the
universal does not appropriate all universality.]{.underline} Woman\'s
relationship to the universal through her gender does include attention
to anatomical difference, but [sexual difference includes much more than
bodily difference.]{.underline} The previous passage emphasizes that
[although women\'s bodies are important for lrigaray, sexual difference
is also based on relationships between people.]{.underline} [Moreover,
these relationships shape sexual difference, as well as being shaped by
it.]{.underline} If lrigaray\'s work advocated biological essentialism,
we would expect a static, universal notion of sex, which would shape
relationships. However, lrigaray does not offer any essential
characteristics of women and men. Instead, she emphasizes the necessity
of cultivating sexual difference in a way that would allow other
differences to flourish.

## 2NC -- Extensions

### 2NC -- Ext -- Irigaray Alt

#### Sexual difference as maintained by masculine, hegemonic discourse is oppressive -- however, without a reconceptualization of sexual difference, it becomes difficult for women to achieve liberation. 

**Schutte 97 (Ofelia Schutte, Professor Emerita of Philosophy as USFG,
"A Critique of Normative Heterosexuality: Identity, Embodiment, and
Sexual Difference in Beauvoir and Irigaray", *Hypatia*, vol. 12 no. 1
(Winter 1997))///AR**

But why maintain the notion of sexual difference at all, some feminists
would want to ask. Isn\'t this notion itself oppressive? Isn\'t this
notion essentially linked to compulsory heterosexuality? In Irigaray\'s
view, [the notion of sexual difference is only oppressive when posited
from the standpoint of a masculinist logic or set of values, as has
generally occurred in our memory]{.underline}**. To this I would add**
[that it is essentially oppressive when linked to a normative view of
heterosexuality.]{.underline} **The challenge then is to unlink the
notion of sexual difference from the normative understanding of
heterosexuality-that is, to rethink and re-symbolize sexual difference,
not to discard it.** [Irigaray holds that, without a reconceptualization
of sexual difference working culturally at the macro level for women\'s
empowerment, it will be very difficult for individual women to achieve
liberation.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Ext -- Social Construct 

#### Gender is a social construct which requires performance and is assigned culturally, physically, and discursively through conditioning from childhood. 

**Ishrad No Date (Shaista Ishrad, Motilal Nehru National Institute of
Technology, "Gender as a social construct in Margaret Atwood's Oryx and
Crake")//AR**

Margaret Atwood being a postmodern writer marks out the [instability of
gender categories, where both male and female characters transgress the
gender boundaries which are believed to be naturally ordained. She
clearly demonstrates through various instances how gender of both men
and women are artificial and socially constructed under the patriarchal
guidance and ideology]{.underline}. **[Since gender identity is all
about performance learned through discourse, male and female characters
exhibit both masculine and feminine identities irrespective of their
sex]{.underline}**. This is more prominently brought up in the novel
through the characters of Oryx and Jimmy. Atwood explains that the
gender construction endows all the power and authority in the hands of
patriarchy. This gendered society segregates women from all the major
spheres, subordinating and marginalizing them to the areas which are
pre-labeled as feminine. This is beautifully expressed in the words of
gender critic Kate Millet, "[As patriarchy enforces a temperamental
imbalance of personality traits between the sexes, its educational
institutions, segregated or co-educational, accepts a cultural
programming towards the generally operative division between,
"masculine" and "feminine" subject matter assigning the humanities and
certain social sciences (at least in their lower and marginal branches)
to the female -- and science and technology, the professions, business
and engineering to the male.... The humanities, because not exclusively
male, suffer in prestige: the science, technologies and business,
because they are nearly exclusively male reflect the deformation of the
"masculine" personality.eg, a certain predatory or aggressive
character]{.underline}"(435). Therefore we see in the novel that science
is associated and believed to represent masculine domain and
intelligence, whereas art along with femininity is marginalized and
suppressed. **[Atwood proves both the gender categories of masculinity
and femininity as unstable and constructed culturally in
discourse]{.underline}**. She shows this more exquisitely through the
character of Jimmy, who despite being man, displays interest in arts,
and defends it against masculine science represented by scientist friend
Crake. Whereas Oryx, being a woman is described as an, "expert
businesswoman" and Crake too trusted her "more perhaps than he trusted
Jimmy"(Oryx and Crake 368). [Gendered boundaries and spaces are shown to
be transgressed by Jimmy and Oryx thereby establishing gendered
identities not as real, rather constructed. Art and aesthetics, though
coined as feminine areas are represented by Jimmy who argues against the
artificially induced mating process by Crake among the Crakers. He
argues that because of the "cyclical" mating process there would be no
existence of, "Courtship behaviour" which would in turn result in loss
of art.]{.underline} "Well, what about the art?" said Jimmy, a little
desperately". He further argues, "When any civilization is dust and
ashes," he said, "art is all that's left over. Images, words, music.
Imaginative structures. Meaning- human meaning, that is- is defined by
them. You have to admit that"(Oryx and Crake 197). Oryx being a woman is
shown to be practical and reasonable in her approach as opposed to Jimmy
who is displayed as emotional and sentimental. Jimmy is shown to be
opposing Crake for all of his scientific endeavors, be it new inventions
or genetically engineered organisms. On the contrary Oryx encouraged
Crake's scientific and practical efforts for the well being of humanity.
She defends scientific ideas of Crake before Jimmy, "He lives in a world
of ideas. He is doing important things. He has no time to play. Anyway
Crake is my boss, you are for fun". Oryx, "respected Crake, she really
did, because he was a brilliant genius"(Oryx and Crake369). Jimmy's
helplessness and sadness at his mother's absence when she goes away
leaving him is quite apparent and can be compared to Atwood's female
protagonist Tony Fermont in *The Robber Bride*. Like Tony he questions
himself, "Didn't she trust him? Evidently not. He felt he'd disappointed
her; he'd failed her in some crucial way. He'd never understood what was
required of him. If only he could have one more chance to make her
happy"(77oc). Thus Jimmy incompetence, his helplessness and tendency to
hold himself responsible for his mother's deserting him alone, can be
compared to the insufficiency and incapability which Tony experiences
during the same condition in her life. Thus Jimmy can be seen exhibiting
another trait that is exclusively linked with femininity. Exhibiting
sentimental and emotional approach towards life, he is amazed by the
practical response of Crake at his mother's death. He felt, "how he
could be so nil about it- it was horrible, the thought of Crake watching
his own mother dissolve like that. He himself wouldn't have been able to
do it"(Oryx and Crake 208). Whereas most of the women characters in the
novel are described as word person, Jimmy too, is shown to be word
person. He already knew he was not a "numbers person", as he was not
practical and materialistic in his approach and view of world, instead
he was sentimental, given to arts and aesthetics and finds solace in
rediscovering forgotten words, "as if they were children abandoned in
the woods and it was his duty to rescue them"(Oryx and Crake 250).
Jimmy, because of his passivity and interest in arts is chosen by Crake,
along with Oryx to look after the Crakers. Both Jimmy and Oryx are
entrusted with the task of looking after Crakers because Crake finds
both similar in one way or the other. When Jimmy enquires why Crake
chose him only for this job where he had many scientists as options
saying "I couldn't head up a thing like this, I don't have the science".
Crake replies, "These people are specialists," said Crake. "They
wouldn't have the empathy to deal with the Paradice models, they
wouldn't be any good at it, they'd get impatient. Even I couldn't do it.
I couldn't begin to get onto their wavelength. But you are more of a
generalist."(Oryx and Crake 376). This reason is quite similar to why
Crake appoints Oryx for the same task. She is appointed as the teacher
for the Craker's as according to him she, "could communicate on their
level. Simple concepts, no metaphysics." (Oryx and Crake 363). This
shows that Crake being a scientist underestimates the aesthetic sense of
both Jimmy and Oryx and assigns them inferior jobs. Likewise another job
given to Jimmy is that of doing add campaign to sell the pills
BlyssPluss to enhance sexual vigour and to prevent sexually transmitted
diseases which proves to be fatal for humanity and destroys whole world.
Oryx too is endowed with the responsibility of selling same pills in
different countries. After worldwide catastrophe caused due to these
pills it is Jimmy who is left at the end to look after the Carkers as
Crake's "prophet"(Oryx and Crake 120). Jimmy being a male exhibits many
feminine traits like being emotional, sentimental, interested in arts
and aesthetics as is seen as child like both by Oryx and Crake. Crake
said, "Jimmy, grow up" Crake wasn't the first person who'd ever said
that to Jimmy."(Oryx and Crake 139). The same phrase is uttered by women
whom he sexually dumps. Oryx too says, "Crake is right"..., "you do not
have an elegant mind"( Oryx and Crake 166). Despite these feminine
traits Jimmy is sexually more potent and dominant than Crake, who
despite being more masculine than Jimmy, is sexually passive. [As Jimmy
describes, "Crake hadn't been what you'd call sexually active. Girls had
found him intimidating"... and a "little creepy"( Oryx and Crake
126-27). Like the deviations exhibited in masculinity by men, Oryx too
deviates from her femininity by being sexually adept and expert against
the prevalent myth of women as sexually passive, inferior and even
sexless.]{.underline} Where jimmy refrains in touching Oryx out of the
respect for his friendship with Crake and believing Oryx to be his
girlfriend Oryx does not refrain from, "seduce\[ing\] him". Jimmy
describes, "She came to his suit on purpose, she marched right in, she
had him out of his shell in two minutes flat. It made him feel about
twelve. She was clearly a practiced hand at this, and so casual on that
first occasion it took his breath away..."what about Crake?" he said
after she'd cooked him that first time, landed left him gasping. "You
are Crake's friend. He wouldn't want you to be unhappy"( Oryx and Crake
367). [The image of Oryx is described as sexual commodity who is
sexually objectified and oppressed in patriarchal society owing to her
femininity. She is harassed both on account of her sexuality and class
and treated as "body" and object. Her femininity is constructed as
object of sexual consumption]{.underline}. Owing to her poor class
status she is sold by her family to rich man named Uncle En who uses her
initially as a flower seller and then as a sex bait to trap sexual
tourists for money. She is subjected to the reality of the use of women
as body since her very childhood. She presents herself as docile and
"obedient" to the command of her masters and "did as she was told". Her
innocence and purity of childhood is tainted with the matters of sex and
its demands by men, "She had a general idea of what else the man might
want -- the other children already knew about such things and discussed
them freely"(Oryx and Crake 153). Thus Oryx is passed from one hand to
another and sold into prostitution serving the desires of men. After
Uncle En is murdered she is sold to a man who made porn movies. She is
sexually used and exploited not only as a child porn star but also by
the movie makers as well. She reveals to Jimmy that the camera man Jack,
"wanted to do movie things with her when there were no movies"( Oryx and
Crake 165). Her last consumers are Crake and Jimmy, where she is
purchased by Crake to use her beauty and sex for his personal and
professional use. Crake exploits her beauty, simplicity and innocence
for the advertisement and sale of his deadly pills. Not only Crake but
Jimmy too sexually uses her though his relation is defined by love.
[Atwood deconstructs the belief of masculinity as biologically superior
and femininity as biologically inferior**. She nullifies the
essentialism associated with gender and sexual identities proving them
to be the product of social and cultural construction. With this the
myth of the superiority of white hegemonic masculinity too is destroyed
where the traits believed to be exclusively belonging to white men are
not exhibited by all white men in the novel.**]{.underline} As described
one of the critics, "Whenever 'white' men enter the scene, they lack any
form of superiority or dominance, as Oryx's description of these men,
often bordering on ridicule indicates"(Q. T Huisman 19). Oryx as a child
mocks and ridicules the penis of one the white sex tourist who tries to
sexually seduce her, "A long white penis nose", and after he is caught
and blackmailed by Uncle En, "Oryx felt bad for him"(Oryx and Crake
154). Another white man is a camera man Jack, who too uses Oryx sexually
and is described by her as, "a rope hair clownish giant with a cock like
wrinkly old carrot. Oryx said she had many chances to see that old
carrot up close, because Jack wanted to do movie things with her when
there were no movies. Then he would be sad and tell her he was
sorry".(Oryx and Crake 165). Oryx, despite being subordinated and
oppressed tries to gain power over her oppressors by refusing to
identify herself as victim and oppressed. She refuses to accept the fact
of her suffering and exploitation by denying revealing the details of
her past life sufferings to Jimmy. It is well cited by Atwood through
various references in the novel that Oryx declines and undermines all
the efforts of Jimmy to b e a bandager for her wounds and afflictions,
thereby refusing any consolation that identified the weakness of Oryx
before Jimmy. Atwood explores through one of the examples how Oryx
prevents herself being treated as a consumable item for Jimmy, "She let
him lick her fingers for her. He ran his tongue around the small ovals
of her nails. This was the closest she could get to him without becoming
food"( Oryx and Crake 371). Thus Oryx remains, "beyond the absolute
control of male protagonist ... and beyond the grasp of scientific male
control"( Q. T Huisman 22). She has "always been evasive, you can never
pin her down"(Oryx and Crake 128). Whenever Jimmy asked the details of
her past life, the details of her sexual oppression, in order to
sympathize with her and to show his dominance over her, she evaded
saying, "I don't know. I've forgotten" or "I don't want to tell you
that" or, "Jimmy you are so bad, its' not your business"(Oryx and Crake
132). Thus she puts down all efforts and tactics of jimmy, which he used
to trap women. Jimmy admired the neediness of women, their
vulnerability, so that he could indebt them with gratefulness as
according to his belief, "A grateful woman would go the extra mile"
(Oryx and Crake 115). Oryx, by refusing to present herself as oppressed
and afflicted, doesn't give Jimmy a superior position and refuses to be
confined herself in the constructed gendered space. Jimmy used the
incidence of his mother's departure, quite successfully to evoke the
sympathy of other women in order to trap them and use their emotions to
his advantage. He used, "that story- a hint here, a hesitation there.
Soon the woman would be consoling him, and he would roll around in their
sympathy, soak in it, massage himself with it. It was a whole spa
experience in itself." ... Only Oryx had not been impressed by this
dire, feathered mother of his. So *Jimmy your mother went somewhere
else? Too bad. May be she had some good reasons. You thought of that?*
Oryx had neither pity for him nor self pity. She was not unfeeling: on
the contrary. But she had refused to feel what he wanted her to feel.
Was that the hook- that he could never get from her what the others have
given him so freely? Was that her secret?"(Oryx and Crake 224- 225).
Thus Oryx is shown to be more practical and reasonable than Jimmy who
displays traits pre-coded as feminine by this gendered society. Where on
the one side Oryx is calm and composed when she narrates her past life
in bits and pieces without exhibiting any emotional or aggressive
behaviour Jimmy gives vent to his pent up anger by abusing her
exploiters. He is even shocked to listen "bad words"(Oryx and Crake 158)
from Oryx, of which "she had a large supply". She even tried to conceal
the acrid aspects of her life, "to protect him, from the image of
herself in the past. She liked to keep only the bright side of herself
turned towards him. She liked to shine"(Oryx and Crake 158). Not only
she outshines and overpowers Jimmy but also other oppressor who exploit
her sexually and socially by pitying them and seeing them as more
helpless than herself. Jimmy abuses uncle En for what he did with Oryx,
she absolves him from the position of oppressor and tells Jimmy that she
even, cried when she heard of his death, "I cried when I heard... too
much'(Oryx and Crake 159). Similarly Oryx felt bad for those who were
caught by Uncle En in a helpless position and were blackmailed for money
to keep the secret of their sexual assault over her as a child. Atwood
writes: "She felt a little sorry for the men ...somewhat regretted her
part. But at the same time she enjoyed it. It made her feel strong to
know that the men thought she was helpless but she was not. It was they
who were helpless, they who would soon have to stammer apologies in
their silly accents"(Oryx and Crake 155) Oryx even tries to exercise her
power over white camera man by using her sexuality as her strength and
weapon by trading with him to teach her, "to speak English and to read
English words". On Jimmy resentment she questions him, "Why do you think
he is bad?"... "He never did anything with me that you don't do. Not
nearly so many things!"(Oryx and Crake 166). [Atwood proves
artificiality of both sex and gender through Crake's scientific
inventions of humanoids or Crakers. Crake's construction of Crakers
confirms the artificiality of, **"Gender, sexual orientation, height,
colour of skin and eyes- it's all on order, it can all be done or
redone"**(]{.underline} Oryx and Crake 340). Crake genetically engineers
Crakers according to his own choice eliminating undesirable traits as,
"the ancient primate brain... the feature responsible for the world's
current illnesses"( Oryx and Crake 340). Thus the Crakers are
constructed as genderless and sexless in order to remove the ground
which results in the inequality and exploitation of weaker by stronger.
Crake explains to Jimmy, "for instance, racism... had been eliminated
... by switching bonding mechanism" so that the Paradice people simply
did not register skin colour." Similarly hierarchy too is removed so
that all are equal and there are no oppressors and oppressed, "Hierarchy
could not exist among them, because they lacked the neural complexes
that would have created it"(Oryx and Crake 358). By manipulating the
building blocks of these Crakers he arranges their reproduction and
sexuality as well, "Their sexuality was not a constant torment to them,
not a cloud of turbulent hormones: they came into heat at regular
intervals, as did most mammals other than men"( Oryx and Crake 359). By
doing so would result in, "No more prostitution, no sexual abuse of
children, no haggling over the prize, no pimps, no sex slaves. No more
rape"( Oryx and Crake 194). He introduces the provision of , "standard
quintuplet, four men and the women in heat"( Oryx and Crake 193) for
which he equipped these women with ultra-strong vulvas- extra skin
layers, extra muscles- so they can sustain these marathons"( Oryx and
Crake 194-95). It is adeptly explored by Atwood that though Crake
pre-designed the sexuality and gender, eliminating any concept of
hierarchy, he couldn't anticipate the gendering and hierarchy imparted
by their guide and caretaker Jimmy/Snowman and set among the Crakers. It
is proved here, "they do not have any culturally preconceived notions of
a gendered cultural order or prescribed norms of sexuality" (Reingard M.
Nischik 123) [as gender is all about performance of ourselves and others
towards us. As Butler defines, "there is neither an "essence" that
gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender
aspires, and because gender us not a fact, the various acts of gender
create the idea of gender, and without those acts, there would be no
gender at all. Gender is, thus, a construction that regularly conceals
its genesis; the tacit collective agreement to perform, produce, and
sustain discrete and polar genders as cultural fictions"(1990, 140).
Hence there is, "no doer behind the deed. The doer becomes formed from
the doing" therefore construction of subjectivity is, " a process of
submitting ourselves to socially constituted norms and
practice]{.underline}"(Rachel Alsop 99).

## **2NC - AT**

### 2NC - AT: Irigaray transphobic 

#### Irigaray is not transphobic -- their author misreads her interpretation of what is to be done -- rather Irigaray critiques a culture where the politics of sexual difference are hegemonic and masculine. 

**Poe 11 (Danielle Poe, 2011, Professor of Philosophy at the University
of Dayton, Ohio, "Can Luce Irigaray's Notion of Sexual Difference be
Applied to Transsexual and Transgender Narratives?",**
[[https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=phl_fac_pub]{.underline}](https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=phl_fac_pub))///AR

Transsexual discourse that understands sexual difference as a dualism
can be understood in the context of lrigaray\'s conception of the
natural, which she develops in Between East and West. I characterize the
notion of sexual difference that she develops in this text as a
\"cultivated natural.\" That is, [she emphasizes the ties that our
bodies always and already have to nature and the natural world, but she
also emphasizes that those ties must be refined and cultivated. The
cultivation that she wants for the body can be derived from her critique
of \"sociological culture\":]{.underline} \[The body) is submitted to
sociological rules, to rhythms foreign to its sensibility, to its living
perceptions: day and night, seasons, vegetal growth . \... This means
that acts of participation in light, sounds or music, odors, touch or
even in natural tastes are no longer cultivated as human qualities. The
[body is no longer educated to develop its perceptions spiritually, but
to detach itself from the sensible for a more abstract, more
speculative, more sociological culture.]{.underline} (lrigaray 2002 \[1
999), 55-56) **[Notice in this passage that lrigaray does not insist
that the body must remain as one finds it.]{.underline}** Instead, [she
critiques a culture in which one turns away from the body, and she calls
for a culture in which the body\'s sensibilities are cultivated and
developed.]{.underline} Thus, a woman\'s or a man\'s body must be
developed in keeping with her or his sex and doing so means paying
attention to nature\'s rhythms, more so than culture\'s demands.
According to Stone, lrigaray connects sexual difference to nature to
emphasize the continuous cycling between poles of difference and
humans\' place in this natural cycle. Nature functions in such a way
that distinct processes function interdependently. Stone gives
respiration as an example: inhalation depends on exhalation, although,
they are distinct processes. [Men and women are the complete realization
of this duality because they cultivate their duality through
culture]{.underline} (Stone 2003, 63-65). Ultimately, [the sexual
difference is about cultivating the negative and the positive,
difference and relationship]{.underline}

#### Poems By Twoey Gray and Sibel Sayiner/Violet Trachtenberg

A Series of Queer Love Notes, starting with Toronto Pride: \
When you banned Queers Against Israeli Apartheid \
from marching in the parade, what did you mean to say? \
That no queers were killed in Gaza since Israel calls itself pro-gay? \
That on tour groups to the Holy Land\
trans people won\'t get stopped by the TSA? \
That Toronto\'s first pride wasn\'t a protest over the bathhouse
raids? \
And when you invited the police to march, were they surveilling us or
keeping us safe? \
Because I know kids whose abusers are on the mic talking about safe
space\
So when you moved the homeless out of the downtown core for World
Pride \
did you think to ask how those people identified? \
Seems you only want to criminalize trans girls street-working to
survive, \
show us you don\'t want us with addiction, us with mental health, us
with melanin alive \
so forgive me for rolling my eyes\
when you\'re there waving flags on CityLine\
\
Dear Gold Stars: \
why\'re you out here bragging how you\'re a better lesbian\
because you\'ve never even seen a dick? \
Is that why when bi kids go to gay events\
you won\'t let their straight partners in? \
Gayness measured in body parts and experience \
like membership to the Equality Club is predicated on some other
exclusion.\
Reducing us to naked bodies in the bedroom is nothing foreign, \
it\'s too familiar, it\'s the transphobic roadkill homophobia dragged
in.\
\
Dear gay guys \"immune to misogyny\": \
unsolicited comments of women\'s outfits and personalities, \
just like the straight boys! Is that what you call equality? \
When you grab a woman\'s tits without her consent, \
you should only need an apology if the dude actually wanted her, \
it\'s different if it\'s just for novelty! \
\
Dear allies -fruit flies - \
the \"if you keep being mean to me I\'m not gonna want to help you
guys\"! ! -\
the \"show up to Pride Parade like a yaoi petting zoo\", teary-eyed
like\
\"this is my gay best friend my best friend who\'s gay\
my gay shopping gay lesbian queer best friend\": \
can you chill for like a millisecond? \
\
Dear Grindr, a safe haven for racists: \
How are people still posting profiles with no fats no fems no Asians? \
Never look twice at a chalk outline but subject black men to
fetishization\
twinks walking around a parody of black women, \
like \"nuh uh girlfriend! ! \" \
\
Dear elders: \
Why is trauma our first ally? \
Cause I know what\'s going on when I\'m at Church and Wellsley\
and I see a young queer eating brunch with an old guy.\
Why does grooming look like mentorship? \
Why\'re we still affirming the same issues that hate bred in? \
\
Something\'s wrong when assault looks like initiation.\
When rainbow flags hanging in banks that ask for gender verification.\
When the queer and trans street youth could care less about
legalization\
but the activists get their marriage license and hand in their
resignation.\
When the Regent Park gays are sweeping up \
after the Lawrence Park pride celebrations, \
when we\'re praying to Lady Gaga for our Big Gay Salvation! ! \
\
Dear media: \
Why do we have to hurt to be real? \
Why, when Tammy\'s mom told her she\'d burn in hell, \
did she tell me she felt like a real lesbian now? \
\
Dear community: \
Why do we settle for this bullshit? \
Worship at the altar of Katy Perry and Glee \
like it\'s good enough to be the token? \
We went from throwing bricks at Stonewall \
to throwing stones at one another - \
Are we so oppressed here that we can never be the problem? \
Do we want justice? Or just a same-sex couple in the next ad for
McDonald\'s? \
Are we so desperate for a voice \
that we\'ll congratulate anyone who mumbles? \
\
Dear Pride: \
I want to be proud of you, despite all the nonsense, \
but I can\'t.\
Not until we can be proud \
of all of us.\

After spending ten minutes watching corporate floats and cis men parade
by\
In their rainbow logos and paraphanalia\
I\'m acutely aware that everyone in the stands is white\
The crowds are cheering for marriage equality, \
Laughing as though the movie for gay liberation is rolling its final
credits\
Crunch, crunch, crunch\
The pride parade marches down market street\
Verizon, Toyota, bank of the west\
Let\'s call it...free market street\
With the floats trickling down the financial district to the tenderloin\
Nike\'s float asks us to #Be True\
Be True to the invisible hand of capitalism\
Don\'t worry, that\'s mother\'s indentured labors stitching your flags,
your t-shirts, your rainbow-colored basketball shoes\
Because look---it\'s wearing a wedding band\
The crowds are screaming, delighted that between Doma and Citizens
United, \
The 479 male-owned Fortune 500 companies can marry each other now\
At the festival, San Francisco police monitor the entrance because
homeless people have nothing to be proud of\
This plaza, most days, is a safe place to sleep\
Now, only a place to be shooed\
The policemen smile, hoping maybe, if they protect enough fruits, we\'ll
forget about fruitvale\
Hoping the many colors of pride will cover the black of Oscar Grant\
Let\'s take a moment to dismantle the six colors of pride\
First, there\'s that sunset red, the bright tange of blood when an
emperor demands you give up your religion, your language, your skin, and
if you do not comply we will put you in\
Orange, twisting you into a criminal, stripping you of the sunlight\
Yellow, like the gold they exploited from you, swallowing every dollar
of\
Green you ever made and called it justice\
Called the blue of the freezing hands of those queer kids on the street
corners justice\
Witness the purple bruises of pride struggle forgetting how it shines so
proudly against their white skin\
There\'s more to celebrate than a parade\
There are voices to be heard that cannot make their way to these
limousines\
Queer people don\'t need sponsors, don\'t need spectators, \
We need immigration justice, and racial justice, \
We need employment and homes\
And equal access to healthcare\
San Francisco Pride, with your corporate, conglomerate, co-sponsors\
And policemen lining the sidewalks\
Whose equality are you celebrating anyway?

#### Consent often fails to achieve its desired consequence---uneven power dynamics unknowingly influence consent and force the subjugated to conform to the wants of those in power.

[Those in power often seek to obtain the consent of the people over whom
they exert it]{.underline}. [It is upon this idea that Weber bases his
distinction between "power" and "domination]{.underline}." The
"[power]{.underline}" of a person [is]{.underline} [his ability to make
others obey]{.underline} him. It may be [based on threat and the fear
this engenders in those over whom it is exercised]{.underline}. [It is
the "opportunity to make one's own will prevail within a social
relationship, even against resistance, regardless of the basis for this
opportunity]{.underline}." [By contrast,]{.underline} [domination is
based on "docility," that is, the consent of those whom domination
affects.]{.underline} It means the "chance to find specific individuals
willing to obey a specific order."\[1\] Max Weber, 1922, Wirtschaft und
Gesellschaft,
Tübingen:\...[\[1\]](https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RAI_046_0067--two-critiques-of-consent.htm#no1)
We know that Weber identifies three sources of legitimacy, that is, of
reasons to consent to an order, namely tradition, rational belief, and
the charisma of the person who issues it.[\[2\] Weber, Économie,
72.\[2\]](https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RAI_046_0067--two-critiques-of-consent.htm#no2)
[The major normative "liberal" theories of political legitimacy are most
often part of the rationalist tradition, stating the "right" reasons for
which a political order can be the object of consent]{.underline}. These
generally relate to "natural" rights that could be preserved by this
order or to interests it would help promote. Weber himself did not
comply with the use of standard language, which confers an evaluative
significance to the term "domination." Instead, his characterization was
purely descriptive and did not indicate whether it was right or wrong
for people to obtain docile assent to their orders. But it seems clear
that according to Weber, the [consent of the subjugated is neither
necessarily absurd nor necessarily contrary to their
interests]{.underline}. Of course, [agreement does not only serve to
legitimize powers. It is also necessary for the normative validity of
all kinds of relationships in that the normative validity of contracts
or promises is based on the consent of the parties
involved]{.underline}. 2 Yet, **[consent has a bad reputation because
the agreement granted is regularly suspected of not having been
sufficiently free to bring about the normative consequences it is
supposed to produce]{.underline}**. The present article has a limited
aim, which is to distinguish between several types of arguments
presented to challenge the significance of consent by linking these
arguments to different ways of conceptualizing freedom and choice, which
have been extensively studied in contemporary political theory. In
exploring these analyses, we will set aside a more radical critique
whose political significance is not very clear and that expresses the
classic "incompatibilist" position, namely the view that human choice is
incompatible with causal determinism. This theory asserts that the
events constituted by human activities, and particularly mental ones,
are related to previous external events by the same causal laws that
apply to other facts of the universe. According to this theory, given
the preconditions and laws of nature, a given decision can be predicted
with a degree of probability comparable to that which governs other
natural processes. If it was established that a person's intentions and
deliberation were produced by an electrical stimulation machine
affecting his nervous system, it would be inappropriate to consider him
free. If the causal theory is true, then all human decisions may be
related to a schema of this kind, and it would no longer be possible to
consider any decision as free because all decisions would all be
explained by a cause external to the human mind. Most discussions of
political freedom are therefore generally situated in a "compatibilist"
framework, where the type of freedom relevant to political and social
matters is considered congruent with the idea that human choices would
be caused by factors that do not depend on the deliberation of agents.
Instead of being interested in the deliberative process, the *mens rea*
of lawyers, compatibilist theoreticians emphasize two different
characteristics of choice, which have independent values and explain why
choice can be considered free even in a causal and deterministic world.
Some insist on the importance of the conditions of choice in exploring
the distinction standard language recognizes between "making a choice"
and "having the choice." Others are interested in the content or the
outcome of choice, asserting that some options are contrary to people's
"real" freedom.

### 1NC -- Link -- Freedom to Compete

#### Conceptualizing consent as "what we want" or "self-determination" requires racial affectability and the relegation of the racial subaltern to the site of originary violence. This precludes the possibility of substantive redress of racial violence because it depends on a state form that sublates the site of necessity into the cycle of economic debt and associates racial violence with conflict among self-interested individuals within a transparent, neutral society. In other words -- the aff thinks that conflict arises because everyone can't get what they want, which erases the form and enactment of racial violence through subject production. This turns and outweighs the aff.

What I am highlighting is how **[in the global present, a compelling
state interest has two very different modalities: the duty to include
and the duty to (self-) preserve---both sustained by the racial
dialectics---for responding to demands for social
justice.]{.underline}** **[Regarding affirmative action as an aspect of
the equality (social inclusion) mandate, it is evident how perverse
"racial dialectics" hide (a) how the dismantling of the welfare state
left these neighborhoods available to the control of kids with guns; (b)
that drug-related violence, including racial (state) violence, serves
the needs of global capital as it takes care of an excess population,
which is no longer necessary for maintaining or increasing the margins
of pro t; and further, (c) there is a compelling economic interest in
the latest inroads into Indigenous lands, as exemplified by Belo Monte
and other mega-dams but also by large plantations for crops designed to
be used as biofuel.]{.underline}** My point is that raciality here
mediates between the mandate for equality and the mandate for secu-
rity. How? Because its **[construction of the racial other as an
affectable subject checks the liberty attributed to the ethical figure
of the human.]{.underline}** **[The constructed racial other authorizes
the state to deploy its forces of self- preservation in Black spaces in
the same way that it authorizes U.S. citizens like Zimmerman to deploy
total violence against an unarmed seventeen- year-old because he was
wearing a piece of clothing, a *hoodie,* which in the postracial United
States has become a (racial) signifier of crime.]{.underline}** Put
differ- ently, **[raciality]{.underline}**, as it did in mid-July 2013,
in that Florida court, **[collapses administration of justice and law
enforcement, thus rendering it possible that the state (and other)
deploy its instruments of total violence without unleashing an ethical
crisis or a guilty verdict.]{.underline}** CONCLUSION My goal here has
not been to accuse liberal juridical architectures of doing what they
are designed to do, which is to support the workings of capitalism. My
desire is to offer a critical engagement with the global present, in
par- ticular targeting formulations of social justice supporting
equality (social inclusion) programs that states advance in response to
mandates from mul- tilateral organizations, INGOs, International
Financial Institutions, and also, of course, their economically
dispossessed constituencies. **[What this consideration of the principle
governing projects of social justice, namely equality of opportunity,
shows is how its ethical fail-safe aspect, the thesis of discrimination,
undermines projects of social (substantive) justice.]{.underline}** This
is accomplished because the discrimination (or exclusion) has been
articulated in the account of racial subjugation, the racial dialectics,
which effectively disavow colonial expropriation and racial (symbolic
and total) violence as the moments of racial subjugation. **[This
perverse dialectics of raciality works as the logic of obliteration (for
self-determination to hold the colonial/racial other cannot exist)
resolves the logic of exclusion (their existence undermines
self-determination and turns rational and free whites/Europeans into
affectable subjects) back into itself (the resulting whites/Europeans'
unbecoming actions negatively affect the racial Other, rendering them
unable to live in the rational free societies Europeans have built)
without ever exposing its operation.]{.underline}** **[Exposing these
workings of raciality shows how urgently an ethical-political program (a
plan for racial/global justice) that does not rely on
self-determination, under its many names, such as liberty or equality,
is needed, because the arsenal of raciality has inscribed violence (at
the core of its account of racial subjugation) in the very fabric of
global political (economic, juridical, and ethical)
architectures.]{.underline}** For this reason, **[any global ethical
program designed to dissolve the effects of the power of raciality must
target the governing logic of obliteration.]{.underline}** **[Under the
rule of the figure of the human, racial subjugation is not about
exclusion from universality.]{.underline}** When **[the tools of
scientific reason]{.underline}** restate modern philosophical statements
and produce the racial other's mind as one unable to conceive or
comprehend the universal, they **[are not]{.underline}**
dys-selecting---and here is how my reading of the human differs from
Sylvia Wynter's---or **[excluding, or discriminating, but producing a
kind of human being with mental attributes that are mapped on their
bodies and places of origin.]{.underline}** For this reason, **[they
produce the global space as the context of humanity, as a diverse unity
(that is, differentiated ethical figures), in such a way as every text
that deploys its tools never fails to find neatly distinguishable
*persons* and *places* of transcendentality (liberty) and affectability
(necessity).]{.underline}** The violence Frantz Fanon finds defining the
colonial space is not intrin- sic to the colonized and their places of
residence; instead, **[it is the very mode of operation of colonial and
racial power; it is the violence the tools of raciality reproduce onto
the global space.]{.underline}** However, it fuses so well with the
state's function of protecting the subjects of liberty
(self-determination) that it is easy to lose sight of this otherwise
evident fact. **[What the demand for self-determination does is erase
the founding colonial juridical-economic architectures (conquest,
settlement, and slavery) that birthed capitalism and
modernity.]{.underline}** Precisely this *occlusion*---an effect of
historicity---sustains the disavowal of affirmative action as a
mechanism for addressing the effects of racial power that has prevailed
in the U.S. Supreme Court decisions dis- cussed earlier. Working in
tandem with obliteration (an effect of scientific universality),
occlusion also responds to the general moral stance before racial
violence, which I term "oblivion." Though **[my argument]{.underline}**
in this article faces off historical materialism, it **[is directed
toward clearing the terrain for an ethical program that begins with
acknowledgment of the founding violence of modern representation but
recalls the need for another point of departure for describing global
existence without self-determination (freedom or liberty) and the
account of affectability and necessity it demands.]{.underline}**

#### The aff's desire for freedom of choice frames social competition as a problem of the existence of a racialized, affectable society -- that things would be easier if we *just knew what we wanted and acted it out* -- this strategy conflates the logic of exclusion with the logic of obliteration and reinscribes racial capitalism -- this turns the aff -- the logics of raciality and violence at the core of conquest are reproduced at the moment of expansion of choice.

Through the notions of liberty and necessity it is possible to
dis-mystify the apparently contradictory role of modern juridical
entities, such as law and the state. Moreover, **[the articulation of
necessity and violence provides clues for grasping how raciality
delimits the modern notion of justice, by producing affectable (racial
subaltern) subjects to whom dear modern universal principles (liberty
and equality) do not apply because they are governed by necessity---that
is, by violence.]{.underline}** All I do here is describe racial
knowledge in such a way that exposes how the principle of liberty works
through an articulation of necessity that results in two logics of
racial subjugation, namely *exclusion* and *obliteration.* Before doing
so let me say a bit more about how necessity appears in descriptions of
modern juridical and ethical order. **[Liberal sociology provides our
most basic image of the post-Enlightenment capitalist social con- text,
as one inhabited by rational individuals who decide and act on the basis
of the principle of liberty. Though participating in its constitution by
choosing their representatives (legislative branch) and welcoming the
protection of the law and the state, they resent any state beyond
enforcement of the law and protection of rights (executive branch) and
administration of justice (judiciary branch).]{.underline}** Looking
back at classic versions of **[the liberal text]{.underline}**, such as
Thomas Hobbes's and John Locke's, we find that they **[base their
descriptions of the proper modern juridical order on the *necessity* to
protect the rational and self-interested individual *liberty* (body and
property) always under threat of violence (theft, enslavement, or death)
from other self-interested individuals.]{.underline}** Consistently,
this "originary violence" would be deployed in later **[major
philosophical writings of the modern ethical order]{.underline}**, in
statements that **[write morality as an interiorized constraint
necessary to curb "originary violence"]{.underline}**: as in Immanuel
Kant's argument that, though apparently contradictory, the moral law
protects freedom (liberty) because it alone preserves what distinguishes
the rational subject, that is, its dignity (intrinsic value); and
Hegel's, which articulates ontological violence in the Lordship and
Bondsman passage, where the life-and-death struggle signals an
"original" situation, a sort of pre-ethical moment before the subject
finds moral unity in the participation in spirit. This description of
the modern ethical order is repeated in nineteenth-century sciences of
man and society, in particular in Émile Durkheim's formulation of the
science of morality (sociology), where he offers the notion of culture
(collective consciousness) to capture the moral bounds (constraints)
necessary for collective life. **[Let me focus on the two basic images
of the postbellum U.S. social con- text presented in sociological
studies: first, the *ideal* one, which is that of a transparent (modern)
society, populated with self-interested individuals, in free
competition, who enjoy the protection of the law and the state; and
second, the *actual* one, which is an affectable (modern) society,
populated with self-interested but racially identified individuals,
where discrimination (as well as racial conflict and competition) rather
than liberty or equality prevail.]{.underline}** **[For social
scientists studying the second image the task was to fix that---the
racial problem---which made it depart from the ideal of a transparent
society.]{.underline}** *The Racial Dialectic Works through the Race
Relation Cycle* When I turn to these studies I find a redeployment of
"originary violence" that describes an ethical order in the moment Hegel
describes in his Lord- ship and Bondage passage.3 **[A perverse racial
dialectic, which combines two socio-logics, namely *exclusion* and
*obliteration* and their effects of signification, is the naturalization
of social subjugation and of blackness as a signifier of
violence.]{.underline}** **[The racial dialectic works through the "race
relation cycle" (conflict =\> competition =\> assimilation =\>
amalgamation) and the "theory of racial and cultural contacts," which
write the colonial architectures and their effect of power (the
expropriation of the productive capacity of native lands and slave
labor) as effects of the naturally violent encounter between racially
different collectives.]{.underline}**4 How does it work? [It
transmutates (a) the **economic debt** resulting from an extreme
economic expropriation (as white Americans continue to hold virtually
all the wealth produced by slave labor) into (b) a **moral deficit**
(which the sight of blackness causes in whites' minds, as Black economic
dispossession becomes an effect of the exclusionary ideas and actions
blackness entails), which is then returned as (c) the racial other's
**mental deficiency** (as economic dispossession and the social
conditions it breed produce a pathological subject unable to thrive on
equal foot in a free, competitive society).]{.underline} **[Its primary
effect is to *occlude* colonial expropriation of the productive capacity
of native lands and slave labor by explaining racial subjugation: a
solely whites' moral deficit (discriminatory actions) explains the
racial others' moral deficiency, while the economic debt can only result
from the subaltern racial difference, which causes whites' moral
deficit.]{.underline}** Two basic accounts of racial subjugation in the
United States derive from this dialectics. **[On the one hand, there is
the partial reading, in which (a) is sublated into (b), renders the
*logic of exclusion,* or the thesis of discrimination, which figures
racial discrimination/inequality as a stain in the otherwise transparent
U.S. social context, and assumes that this anomaly would disappear with
the elimination of racial beliefs---through education and improving
Black people's conditions, through mechanisms to bring about equality of
opportunity.]{.underline}** **[On the other hand, we have the full
reading, which does not sublate (a) into (b)---that is, a
juridico-economic element (colonial expropriation) is not translated
into an ethical one (irrational prejudice and false beliefs) that
colonial expropriation is at the "origin" of the economic debt plaguing
the racial "others of Europe."]{.underline}** **[Because it attends to
how racial difference as signifier of mental capacity (mental
deficiency) is a product of nineteenth-century racial knowledge and not
the effect of white "prejudice" (moral deficit), this reading highlights
the explanatory primacy of the logic obliteration, registered in the
first (conflict) and the last (miscegenation) moments of the "racial
relations cycle"; both refigure the trust of colonial expropriation
(conquest, settlement, and slavery), which is the expropriation of the
total value yielded by native land and slave labor, something that
consistently bet on an ethical indifference to the annihilation of the
native and the enslaved.]{.underline}**

#### The drive towards freedom to compete or have choices reinvests in the state because of how it situates raciality -- the aff requires the enforcement of non-discrimination that constricts consent thru the juridical channels of the state and therefore inscribes the same logic of exclusion that prevents substantive redress of racial violence and results in the pathologizing of raciality.

Let me highlight two aspects of this account of racial subjugation that
interest me. First, **[because it presupposes the ideal U.S. social
context, the thesis of discrimination (through the *logic of exclusion*)
only authorizes the kind of state action described in the classical
texts, that is, to protect liberty and property]{.underline}**. Second,
**[the explanatory primacy of *logic of obliteration* recalls how it is
a sociological reiteration of the moral philosophical
statements]{.underline}**, such as in Hegel, **[that postulate that
post-Enlightenment white/Europe(ans) monopolize modern ethical
principles, such as liberty and dignity.]{.underline}** Put differently,
[through the thesis of discrimination, raciality works from within the
liberal text checking the ethical claims and the juridical strategies
available to those demanding remedies to address the effects of racial
subjugation.]{.underline} First, **[as a sociological tool of raciality,
the thesis of discrimination *occludes* the fundamentally political
(juridico-economic) character of racial subjugation, as it inherits the
naturalization of colonial expropriation into the "theory of racial and
cultural contacts."]{.underline}** Second, **[because it derives from a
partial reading of the "race relations cycle," which renders the racial
subaltern's racial (mental and physical) difference as the primary cause
of their subjugation, discrimination easily accommodates *oblivion*
(in/difference) as an acceptable moral response to harm done to the
racial subaltern, for ultimately their plight results from how *nature*
(both in its divine and scientific rendering) governs their (bodily,
mental, social) conditions of existence.]{.underline}** In the global
juridical architectures, raciality works through the notions of the
human and *naturalized* cultural (intellectual and moral) difference.
**[Whenever the post-Enlightenment notion of the human is deployed in a
juridical context, it combines with cultural difference to enable the
statement that (a) the idea of the human conveys a unity of diversity,
(b) the ethical principle of dignity (the sanctity of human life), but
also that (c) the view that the "cultures" of the racial subaltern
("nobodies") do not respect the latter principle.]{.underline}** Not
surprisingly, whenever the U.S. state's self-protecting forces (the
police or the military) deploy (or authorize) total violence against
Black, Latino, Arab, or Muslim persons, they consistently (and more
often than not successfully) justify these actions on the basis that
these per- sons constituted a threat to those who killed them because
these "nobodies" have no respect for the sanctity of human life.5 No
wonder then, **[in the absence of a "compelling state interest," before
the liberal halls of justice, the racial subaltern becomes consistently
*nobody,* a person without value.]{.underline}** **[Both in moral and
legal interpretations of equality, the thesis of discrimination
reproduces the *occlusion* of colonial expropriation and *oblivion* to
injuries to racial subaltern collectives---as such, it acts as an
ethical check on state- mandated or state-supported remedies beyond the
protection of the right to equality before the law.]{.underline}**6
*"The Rights Secured by Justice"* Though equality of opportunity, as the
remedy to racial discrimination, was already circulating in sociological
treatises, political speeches, and juridical frameworks, John Rawls's
celebrated 1971 volume, *A Theory of Justice,* is unquestionably the
authoritative articulation of this moral concept in con- temporary
liberal philosophy.7 My interest in revisiting Rawls's articula- tion of
**[equality of opportunity]{.underline}** lies in how it **[reproduces
the effects of the racial dialectic, that is, *occlusion* of colonial
expropriation and *oblivion* to racial subjugation.]{.underline}** More
particularly, I am interested in the consequences of his placing of
social justice in a picture of the "basic structure of society," in
which economic inequalities are contingent upon the decision about how
major social institutions (family, economic, political) should function.
**[Because it subsumes equality to liberty, his formulation settles the
thesis of discrimination at the core of equality of opportunity, as a
fail-safe device that undermines ethical (moral) arguments in support of
substantive measures able to redress the economic debt resulting from
colonial expropriation and perpetuated by racial
subjugation.]{.underline}** How so? **[When presenting his theory of
justice, Rawls's decisive move is to ground social justice on the
principle of equal liberty, in a portrait of the ideal liberal
capitalist context.]{.underline}** **[From this, individuals'
self-interested decisions, and not colonial expropriation (of lands and
labor), racial (symbolic or total) violence, or heteropatriarchal
subjugation, explain the social inequalities pervasive in his picture of
the "basic structure of society." The defining statement is that what is
at stake in social justice is not the actual structure but how the
social subject navigates in it.]{.underline}** For this reason, [the
task of the decision makers concerned with promoting equality is not to
change the "basic struc- ture of society" but to follow principles (of
justice) that ensure that no social subject is stuck in the "least
advantageous positions."]{.underline} Not surprisingly, both principles
of justice articulate the thesis of discrimination, which can only be
corrected by the principle of liberty: (I) "Each person is to have an
equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a
similar liberty for others" and (II) "Social and economic inequalities
are to be arranged so that they are both (a) reasonably expected to be
to everyone's advantage, and (b) attached to positions and offices open
to all."8 Furthermore, he reiterates this subsumption of equality to
liberty by highlighting that "a departure from the institutions of equal
liberty required by the first principle cannot be justified by, or
compensated for, by greater social and economic advantages. The
distribution of wealth and income, and the hierarchies of authority,
must be consistent with both the liberties of equal citizenship and
equality of opportunity."9 From that he derives a formulation of social
justice based on a principle of equality without historical or
structural reach. My point is that Rawls presents a naturalized view of
economic in- equality in the formula "original position": namely, the
unequal positioning (because of the play of conflicting and mutual
interests) of the rational self- interested individuals, who recognize
their mutual interest in liberty, when deciding on the principles of
justice under the "veil of ignorance." **[Inequality describes a static
social arrangement, in terms of already given social positions, where
change relates to the decision on how individuals should move through
these positions.]{.underline}** **[Consistently, equality of opportunity
derives its moral necessity when in correspondence to liberty; that is,
opportunity means the freedom to enjoy social mobility---not to be
discriminated against in situations of competition.]{.underline}**
**[Such a view of social justice could not be further removed from the
account of social inequalities in denunciations of colonial
expropriation, racial violence, and patriarchal domination articulated
in 1960s civil rights women's movements, for instance.]{.underline}**
And yet equal- ity of opportunity would be the prevailing basis for
supporting affirmative action as an instrument for social redress.
"COMPELLING STATE INTEREST" Nearly fifty years later, then president of
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Sherillyn Ifill's
remembrance of the "promise of racial equality and justice for all" in
the wake of the Zimmerman decision echoes President Johnson's 1965
speech to Howard University's students and faculty, in which he reminded
them that "freedom is not enough," that what was needed was substantive
equality, tangible, measurable results, such as edu- cational
achievement.10 Throughout the 1960s and in the early 1970s this pledge
seemed to hold, when a number of substantive measures for reme- dying
racial inequalities, in particular in education but also in employment,
were put into place. The backlash that followed had many political
determi- nants, such as the FBI and COINTELPRO's virtual decimation of
internal radical fronts and the end of the imperial misadventure in
Vietnam. Evi- dently, though mentioned in President Kennedy's June 1963
address, the political context does not enter in the *Bakke* court's
considerations when it used failure to prove a compelling state interest
to decide against substan- tive affirmative action measures. Under the
umbrella of President Johnson's "Great Society," the wording in Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act allowed for a series of legislation and
policies, in particular but not only in education, that were termed
attempts to address the effects of slavery upon Black people in the
United States. Nevertheless, though publicly celebrated as a decisive
statement on the U.S. commitment to racial justice, the Act includes a
fail-safe device, [**the thesis of discrimination, which undermines
claims for substantive racial remedies and works, on two levels: (1)
Juridically, in regard to both the law and the state, the very structure
of the Act situates it in the "checks and balances" frame that organizes
the U.S. political architecture**. In other words, because the state is
construed as a self-interested party---always prone to abuse its legal
authority, that is, to intervene in order to limit its citizens equal
liberty---its actions must be also subjected to judicial
review.]{.underline} (**[2) Ethically, because the principle of liberty
supersedes equality of opportunity (its correlated thesis of
discrimination)]{.underline}**; as we saw in Rawls's moral philosophi-
cal articulation, **[the latter alone cannot withstand moral
scrutiny.]{.underline}** **[Under this supremacy of the principle of
liberty, aided by the "racial dialectic" (its naturalizing of the
effects of past and present economic expropriation and juridical
domination), it is no surprise that the even relatively timid social
reforms implemented in the 1960s and 1970s, under the guidance of the
Act, would not survive scrutiny when they came before the U.S. halls of
administrations of justice.]{.underline}** What landmark U.S. Supreme
Court's decisions on affirma- tive action initiatives in higher
education expose is that equal opportunity holds racial redress to a
narrow legal construction of equality as equal pro- tection before the
law or to the argument of a "compelling state interest."

### 1NC -- Link - Empathy

#### Empathy causes one to imagine the pain of another as one's own. Instead of increasing understanding of the sufferer it redirects the empathizer to feel for themselves which facilitates the erasure of the sufferer. In the case of slavery this denies black sentience as of black experiences are supplanted by white observers.

**Hartman 97** (Hartman, Saidiya V. Scenes of Subjection: Terror,
Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America. Oxford
University Press, 1997. Pages 18-20 //mms)

The nature of the feelings aroused here is rather complicated. While
this flight of imagination enables a vicarious firsthand experience of
the lash, excoriates the pleasure experienced by the master in this
brutal exercise of power, and unleashes Rankin\'s fiery indignation and
resentment, the phantasmic vehicle of this identifica-tion is
complicated, unsettling, and disturbing. [Although Rankin\'s fantasy
culmi-nates in indignant outcries against the institution of slavery
and, clearly, the purpose of this identification is to highlight the
crimes of slavery, this flight of imagination and slipping into the
captive\'s body unlatches a Pandora\'s box and, surprisingly, what comes
to the fore is the difficulty and slipperiness of empathy.]{.underline}
Properly speaking, [empathy is a projection of oneself into another in
order to better under-stand the other or \"the projection of one\'s own
personality into an object, with the attribution to the object of one\'s
own emotions]{.underline}. \"4 [Yet empathy in important respects
confounds Rankin\'s efforts to identify with the enslaved because in
making the slave\'s suffering his own, Rankin begins to feel for himself
rather than for those whom this exercise in imagination presumably is
designed to reach]{.underline}. Moreover, by exploiting the
vulnerability of the captive body as a vessel for the uses, thoughts,
and feelings of others, [the humanity extended to the slave
inadvertently confirms the expectations and desires definitive of the
relations of chattel slavery]{.underline}. In other words, the ease of
Rankin\'s [empathic identification is]{.underline} as much [due
to]{.underline} his good intentions and heartfelt opposition to slavery
as [to the fungibility of the captive body]{.underline}. By making the
suffering of others his own, has Rankin ameliorated indifference or only
confirmed the difficulty of understanding the suffering of the enslaved?
Can the white witness of the spectacle of suffering affirm the
materiality of black sentience only by feeling for himself? Does this
not only exacerbate the idea that black sentience is inconceivable and
unimaginable but, in the very ease of possessing the abased and enslaved
body, ultimately elide an understanding and acknowledgment of the
slave\'s pain? Beyond evidence of slavery\'s crime, what does this
exposure of the suffering body of the bondsman yield? Does this not
reinforce the \"thingly\" quality of the captive by reducing the body to
evidence in the very effort to establish the humanity of the enslaved?
Does it not reproduce the hyperembodiness of the powerless? The purpose
of these inquiries is not to cast doubt on Rankin\'s motives for
recounting these events but to consider the precariousness of empathy
and the thin line between witness and spectator[. In the fantasy of
being beaten, Rankin must substitute himself and his wife and children
for the black captive in order that this pain be perceived and
experienced. So, in fact, Rankin becomes a proxy and the other\'s pain
is acknowledged to the degree that it can be imagined, yet by virtue of
this substitution the object of identification threatens to
disappear]{.underline}. In order to con-vince the reader of the horrors
of slavery, Rankin must volunteer himself and his family for abasement.
Put differently, [the effort to counteract the commonplace callousness
to black suffering requires that the white body be positioned in the
place of the black body in order to make this suffering visible and
intelligible]{.underline}. Yet if this violence can become palpable and
indignation can be fully aroused only through the masochistic fantasy,
then it becomes clear that [empathy is double-edged, for in making the
other\'s suffering one\'s own, this suffering is occluded by the
other\'s obliteration]{.underline}. Given the litany of horrors that
fill Rankin\'s pages, this recourse to fantasy reveals an anxiety about
making the slave\'s suffering legible. This anxiety is historically
determined by the denial of black sentience, the slave\'s status as
object of property, the predicament of witnessing given the legal status
of blacks, and the repression of counterdiscourses on the \"peculiar
institution.\" Therefore, [Rankin must supplant the black captive in
order to give expression to black suffering, and as a consequence, the
dilemma---the denial of black sentience and the obscu-rity of
suffering---is not attenuated but instantiated]{.underline}. [The
ambivalent character of empathy]{.underline}---more exactly, [the
repressive effects of empathy]{.underline}---as Jonathan Boyarin notes,
[can be located in the \"obliteration of otherness\" or the facile
intimacy that enables identification with the other only as we \"feel
ourselves into those we imagine as ourselves]{.underline}.\" And as a
consequence, [empathy fails to expand the space of the other but merely
places the self in its stead]{.underline}.5 [This is]{.underline} not to
suggest that empathy can be discarded or that Rankin\'s desire to exist
in the place of the other can be dismissed as a narcissistic exercise
but rather [to highlight the dangers of a too-easy intimacy, the
consideration of the self that occurs at the expense of the slave\'s
suffering, and the violence of identification]{.underline}.6

#### Empathizers replace victims with themselves, encroaching on the space of or blocking out victims entirely. This centralizing of one's own experience is thus merely a form of hegemony of the historically privileged.

As for disingenuous empathy---and this is most important for our
purposes---[some scholars have attacked media representations of
suf-fering as "entertainment."]{.underline} Such remarks are legion,
[particularly in regard to the Holocaust, and have generated new
suspicions of empathy and its motives and purposes]{.underline}. In one
strain of this argument, found primarily in the works of literary
theorists, [certain representations of the Holocaust establish false
equivalences between different kinds of suffering]{.underline}. As both
James E. Young and Andrea Liss have argued in distinct ways, [efforts at
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to facilitate spectators'
identifica-tion with victims' suffering often end up dissolving the
difference between spectators and Holocaust victims and encouraging a
lazy and false empa-thy in which we simply take the other's
place.]{.underline} Young cites the identity cards bearing names and
profiles of victims, which ask the museum visitor to "become" a Jew from
Lithuania, a gypsy who perished at Auschwitz, and so on. Liss focuses on
the effort to display historical artifacts of the deportations and
camps. She argues [that in spite of the understandable effort to evoke
victims' experiences, the exhibit problematically suggests that if only
we exercise enough imagination, we could be there too]{.underline}. Both
Young and Liss argue that [such exhibits or strategies of identification
decontextualize and blot out the experience of victims by encouraging a
false likeness between them and us]{.underline}.22In another discussion
of the "repressive effects of empathy on those who remain beyond the
pale," Jonathan Boyarin argues that "[in popular culture representations
of the Holocaust, the particular horror ofthe Nazi genocide is
emphasized by an image of Jews as normal Europe-ans, 'just like
us.']{.underline} In fact [we can only empathize with, feel ourselves
into, those we can imagine as ourselves." "The space of the other," he
writes, is therefore not really expanded]{.underline}. Such revelations
suggest that [empathy entails obliterating boundaries between self and
other in order to take the victim's place]{.underline}---a *reduction ad
absurdum* of empathic logic in which [the imagination absorbs and thus
annihilates what it contemplates]{.underline} (86--88).23Moreover, in
this view, [identification with the victim and repression of his or her
difference---or unconscious presumptions about the centrality of our own
experience---go together, and empathy turns out to be a dis-guised form
of (in this case gentile) hegemony. This discussion thus links the
corruption of empathy to the psychological and political premises of
Enlightenment universalism, whose emphasis on our likeness disguises and
even eradicates our real differences in the interests of the
historically privileged who define the standard against which likeness
is measured.]{.underline}

#### Humanity has been disconnected from black women as intimacy has weaponized against making them vulnerable to violence. This prevents them from consenting because they don't have ownership of their own body. They don't have access to privacy they are privatized and will always be criminalized.

This part of the talk, Shades of Intimacy, gives its name to a
problematic that really doesn't have an end in sight, and I suppose
quite a lot can be said about it still further, as quite a lot has
already been said about it. And that is to say: what is the status of
women in the circumstance of revolution in Europe, or the birth of the
modern French state, and at two different sites in the Americas: in the
French Antilles and Saint-Domingue, in route to becoming Haiti, or the
first black modern republic on the globe, and the British colonies in
North America, on the trajectory of what becomes the United States of
America? The eighteenth century bears special markings for us, as these
three sites---what becomes the United States, the modern French state,
and Haiti---are exemplary because they demonstrate, with occasional
clarity if we can read the signs, what is at stake in the emergence of a
subject that we call today "African-diasporic", or a subject who was
interstitial to African and New World cultural forms. Ira Berlin
suggests that [the location of this subject]{.underline} in the
netherworld of coastal, sub-Saharan West-Africa [yields a prototypical
African, or a prototypical hyphenated African subject.]{.underline} This
interstitial subject appears to belong to the eighteenth century in
particular, because his presence/her \[their\] presence expresses the
paradox, or makes the paradox appear, of the world that claims it wants
freedom, yet tolerates slavery in at least a third of it. This is the
era of the problem of slavery in the western world, as David Brion Davis
and other investigators have defined it. "What does it mean to be
human?" is evoked with special acuity [during the time of
revolution,]{.underline} because the question [entails a historical
apprenticeship that is not limited to black personality,]{.underline}
but draws humanity into its toils precisely because [what has counted as
human is suddenly transformed by the collapse of order and
decree]{.underline}. If sovereignty, for example, comes to ambiguously
reside in a representative symbolic figure, as the idea of democracy is
strengthened, then its reverberations will be felt throughout the
sociopolitical order; but more than that, the contradictions born of the
simultaneity of slavery and freedom, of the absolute interpenetration of
one and the other, are startling in their apparently universal
significance. This weave of relations is partially shrouded by the
public world of profit and production, just as it disappears into the
shadowy remoteness of the private world with its masks of affection,
sentimentality, and cruelty. The one word that crosses this ambiguous
territory of public and private, light and shade, production and
reproduction, could be intimacy, intimacy that registers the confusion
precisely because it is, in this instance, neither fish nor fowl. What
do we call children born of sexual congress between the enslaved and
their owners? More precisely, the liaison between the enslaved and their
masters? Douglass, in his 1845 narrative, observes a new social fact on
the ground of coercive labor. [The sexual work engendered in this
calculus of relations has produced]{.underline} what Douglass calls
there, as you will remember, ["new people",]{.underline} although, such
children have appeared in the Virginia colony in the eighteenth century
and even before, in the story Ira Berlin tells about communities that
spring up along the African literal. Douglass draws out this strand of
sociality because he wants to emphasize the other corruption of
slavery's protocols: masters who own their children. As such a subject
himself, Douglass was keenly aware of the contradictions of his
status---that mixed race standing did not guarantee freedom even as it
enhanced the owner's profit. An investigator is struck by the
epiphenomenon of the "new people", not only because of figures like
Frederick Douglass and Sally Hemings, who was the daughter and mother of
interracial crossing, but also as these particulars lead us to a broader
inquiry about intimate life in a world that allows, indeed enables, both
family life, in its juridical privilege and personality, and
extra-familial life, as the secret heart of the family's other. The
stuff of novels and film, as for example, William Wells Brown's Clotel;
or, The President's Daughter will attest, this familial
parallelism---the family and the shadow family---is not an exception to
the rule, but as it came to me not too long ago, it was as common as
grass and appears to be a substantial arrangement of slavery's
generations across the color line. So it's almost as if saying: [not who
was involved in such relationships but who was not involved in such
relationships.]{.underline} So what I hope to extract from the record
eventually is a redefined and refined sense of intimacy in a
circumstance where flesh becomes the medium of exchange. The problematic
that I am attempting to isolate in this project is how to name what
appears at a depth in the century of revolution. [We have a fairly good
sense of the spatiotemporal sweep of the revolutionary arc, but what I
am searching for attempts to evade the archives, to disappear into the
world of the everyday]{.underline}. If the shadow families of the master
class were defined by their economic relations to the master, then how
did this intrusion of money matters reconfigure the whole range of
structures of feeling, of intimate relations between husbands and wives,
of the sibling relationship? In other words, one even begins to suspect
that affection, official affection, is {?} under circumstances that
allow slavery. So we are confronted here by two genres of
historiography, or the historiographical record. I would call Annette
Gordon-Reed's work on The Hemingses of Monticello, for example, a
prominent instance of positive assertion. In the triad of texts that I
am sure you are familiar with that she has so far produced on Sally
Hemings's liaison with Thomas Jefferson, the overall narrative that she
advances pursues the tropological fortunes of what Toni Morrison has
referred to as "the American romance of race". In this instance, Hemings
and her relatives are given protective cover and a proximity to
Jefferson that spares them the more brutal realities of enslavement.
This mode of historiographical reflection resembles a kind of
fiction-writing as in the case of Barbara Chase-Riboud's Hemings novels
that posit the seed or the seeds of intimacy between masters and the
enslaved. In other words, [the enslaved is constituted in those novels,
more or less, as sexual objects of desire, so that what we understand as
love and intimacy are not only possible between master and slave, but
even likely.]{.underline} In the antithetical instance, the
historiographical narrative paints a different picture that projects a
negative assertion. For example, in a study of intimacy in the
Antebellum South, Steven Stowe, author of this study, argues that [even
the most persistent and intense contact between masters and the
bonded]{.underline}---as in the case of enslaved figures who, like the
Hemingses, worked as domestic servants in the household of
masters---[did not yield intimacy between parties]{.underline}. As Stowe
describes it, intimacy, in the Antebellum South, was aligned with public
forms and perception, as expressed in rituals of courtship. Such rituals
assured the acknowledgement of an intimate relation's unfolding, so that
the ritual became a kind of knowledge, we might say, or epistemology
distributed to members of a class, or affiliates of a class, which
bespeaks a sharing of values. This very private thing, which is a very
private thing in our world, between and among lovers, which we relegate,
in the sharable imaginary, to the private and public sphere, if those
terms still work, is relegated in Stowe's conceptual narrative to the
world of public forms and performance. Why does the difference matter,
or how does it matter? If close proximity, or constant contact, does not
guarantee intimacy in this social order, then it seems to me that our
notions of intimacy and shades of intimacy are thrown into crisis. This
is what I mean: [if proximity is not reliable as a measure of social
cohesion, if sexual partners and their children can be sold off, if
shadow families can assert no claim to the human dignity of official
families, then sentimentality and feelings of love can be shown to be
unstable, and that's across the social order]{.underline}, it seems to
me that we could say that justifiably. Did slavery across the western
world rupture ties of kinship and filiation so completely that the
eighteenth century, and possibly earlier, demolishes what Constance
Classen in The Deepest Sense: A Cultural History of Touch calls a
tactile cosmology? When in an earlier piece of writing [I saw the
distinction between body and flesh,]{.underline} I was attempting to
isolate features of citizen belonging from alien bodies and entities. [I
would associate bodiedness with juridical personality, or the historical
actor who has access to what our Fourteenth Amendment would call "due
process"]{.underline}. Under its impress, at least in theory, other
rights-bearing follows in its wake. Flesh describes an alien intimacy,
or an alien entity---a more or less expendable figure. Not only does the
alien, by race or language, or culture and custom, not have access to
the protocols of due process, but perhaps [its most poignant
determination is the extent to which such a body cannot prevent or ward
off another's touch]{.underline}. For me, the single most powerful
evidence of the loss of freedom is the fact that bodies lose their
integrity and may be invaded or entered, so to speak, by coercive power.
[This touch that we associate with intimacy---the haptic that we
associate with intimacy---can, under the right conditions, engender
invasion and violence, and in its immediacy, in relationship to the
enslaved, robs the haptic of its powers to heal, to bind, to cure, and
becomes instead the power to wound and violate]{.underline}. As you
know, Audre Lorde talks about this in her powerful essays on the erotic.
Another note from Classen's study of this particular sense: "In the
sensory scale of 'races' created by the natural historian Lorenz Oken,
the 'civilized' European 'eye-man,' who focused on the visual world, was
positioned at the top and the African 'skin-man,' who used touch as his
primary sensory modality, at the bottom." I am suggesting that, under
slavery's regime, [the captive body's susceptibility to being touched
places this body on the side of the flesh, so that touching, here,
is]{.underline} not a token of social cohesion, of brotherhood or
fellowship or fellow feeling, and certainly it has nothing to do with
the erotic, or does it (maybe...it just occurred to me, that maybe
that's the question...okay...), but rather [the very depth and breadth
of alienation, among other things, from the laws, and perhaps even ways
of distinguishing human life from bare life or animal life.]{.underline}
The leading descriptive features of slavery's eras tend to be economic
in the most pointed sense of the term---balance sheets and accounting
procedures, gains and losses, profit margins and the flow of
goods---while our most sustained focus on the institution and its
practices comes to rest on what Pierre Bourdieu might have called a
"general science of the economy of practices". In other words, the
argument based on narrow economic considerations [defines the enslaved
as a species of property.]{.underline} By contrast, the argument that
seeks to mobilize an understanding of the position of the enslaved, and
of the world that unmakes him and her \[them\], as a cumulative instance
of a general science of an economy of practices attempts to grasp the
circumstance of the bonded as a type of historical subjectivity. In both
the species of property and a type of historical subjectivity, we
recognize, in their very naming, the ambivalence of status that would
prohibit either from standing in as a pure or legible example of
property, or a purely foreclosed instance of the subject of history,
which revolutionary movement seeks to create. Neither embodies the
paradigmatic norm from which deviation might be gauged[. The enslaved,
then, is already a category mistake whose subject begins her/his
\[their\] human odyssey in paradox, as a mark or an inscription of the
catachrestic dilemma that exposes irreconcilable or incommensurate
postures.]{.underline} We might think of slavery, then, for the
enslaved, as a series of gaps or aporias of which even the slaveholder,
himself, is aware, generating parallel contradictions given his utter
dread that definitive police power, an extension of his own dominance
and the force of law, are not enough. The fascinating spectacle of moral
and political jiu-jitsu that colonial power dances around the dilemma of
the enslaved---for instance, Jefferson's splitting of the difference
between the simultaneously held beliefs in gradual emancipation and
black repatriation, or the long train of abolitionist thinkers who
embraced the principle of emancipation yet believed [at the same time
that the African is far less human and sociable than others, or yet
across the revolutionary terrain]{.underline}, the colonialist's
rhetorical appropriation of the discourses of liberation in their own
behalf, while denying the legitimate human claims of the enslaved---[all
reflect the tensions unleashed by the African's ontological status as
the confounding of human and proprietary aims and
identities.]{.underline} Mixed race or mulattoness belongs to this
calculus of contradictions. The available racial ascriptions of
Jefferson's and Hemings's world are as inadequate and flawed as the
concept of race itself. Interstitial to the allegedly fixed postures of
black and white, the mulatto is confined to a liminal space that is
dragged along, at least in the US instance, as an unresolved figure of
slavery's closure, although, as we've already noted, one's being
neither/nor does not save her from the arbitrary and whimsical reflexes
of power that define the behavior of the master class. Sally Hemings, in
the particular instance, embodies a supplementary dilemma, insofar as
her supposed erotic relationship to the empowered positions her within
the precincts of sentiment or feeling. As sentimentality plays out among
the Hemingses, two generations of children born to enslaved women carry
the mother's last name. This defining children by the name and status of
the mother is instrumental to the overriding significance of property
rights and the laws of inheritance. Though erotically involved with
power, and herself the product of such an engagement, Sally Hemings was
not manumitted by her famous owner during his lifetime, but her children
would be. Annette Gordon-Reed notes that only a handful of Jefferson's
considerable population of the enslaved was let go before his death, and
these were all Hemings's. The good offices of sentimentality apparently
went just so far, or about as far, as the status of the mulatto, which
remained an open question for the slaveholder. It could be said then
that the social distance that we perceive between black and white made
the location of the color line strikingly clear. While the mulatto's or
the mulatta's figure falling athwart the difference sustains no legally
defined social identity. Sally Hemings is roughly analogous to women of
the master class, white specifically This does not mean all white women;
rather it defines precisely women of the master class insofar as she,
like they, followed Amy Dru Stanley's analysis "remained within
households bound together by ties of affection", though admittedly, we
cannot be sure about the affection piece, in this case and cases like
it. If white women who embodied the concept of sex difference gained no
individual entitlements in relation to contract theory and practice,
which came to take the place of relations of dominance and subservience,
then their deficiency of judicial personality was predicated on the fact
that they were ironically a part of the family. Protected by neither the
heroics of masculinity, as black men would be in gaining the franchise
nearly a century later, nor the prerogatives of sentimentality, as women
of the master class would be, African women of the Republican Era fall
outside the disposable subject positions, as interstitial as Sally
Hemings, but for different reasons that the documents of the era make
available, and the Haitian Constitution of 1805 offers an interesting
contrast or exception to those documents. Their lack of juridically
defined personality, except in negative cases, exposes the fundamental
lability and changeability of "free" and "enslaved". In other words,
what comes to be reified as natural to the identity of white males turns
out to be the subject of risk and negotiation. In effect, [black women,
customarily and emphatically, not Sally Hemings as fiction and
historiography imagine her, can only breach the territory of the human
as members of a race]{.underline} just as their brethren, and their
entire historical apprenticeship, as a result, is [contextualized on the
muddy ground that falls between sex-gender distinctions]{.underline}, on
the one hand, and race difference, on the other---between the private
realm and the erotic on the one hand, [that depends on sex-gender
difference, and the public realm and the historical on the other, that
is predicated on race difference.]{.underline} The equality that is
evoked in the three founding documents---the Declaration of
Independence, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, the
Constitution of Haiti 1802 and 1805---emanate from the notion of the
self-willing, self-owning one, whose interest in property is now a
matter of law. Another like himself is neither more nor less than he, as
access to markets and money and the law arbitrate between and among
legal personalities. Amy Dru Stanley, in her study of the import of
contract theory and practice in From Bondage to Contract, provides a
link between changing attitudes about labor, sentiments about freedom
and equality, and the blossoming movement of emancipation that is tied
to the revolutionary ideal. Transitory and fleeting, the contractual
relationship did not extend beyond its reason for being, and for some
observers, the world of contract is solidly set over and against the
sentimental realm, or the realm of feeling. [Belonging to the sphere of
private and personal relations, sentiment is oppose to contract and
comes to describe women's sphere and its grammars of feeling, including
sexual and erotic gestures that mark it off from the public world of
action over things.]{.underline} It is opposed to the sphere of the
jurisprudential. As the slavery debate intensifies and proceeds through
the decades leading up to the civil war, contract theory plays a crucial
role in configuring conceptualizations engendered by the abolitionist
campaigns. Stanley even goes so far as to contend that "[contract became
the language of insurgent popular politics]{.underline}", and that much
of the force of its appeal was adopted from African women's New World
experience. Two key principles obtain here, as we have noted before:
slavery denies contractual ability in the enslaved, but even before
that, the enslaved is divested of self-ownership, and therefore must
suffer the convoys of evil that follow in the wake of such deficiency.
The experiences or the [experience of slave women under slavery's
regimes advances the notion of a double-threat, insofar as they were
vulnerable to sexual torture and abuse, as well as the repertoire of
normative discipline and punishment that attaches to the travails of
violently coerced labor]{.underline}---not that the male did not endure
the same hail. I would argue, however, [that the rights of the master of
the household placed women in power's orbit in a systematically
provocative way. The sexual use and abuse of black women in slavery was
the rule.]{.underline} Hemings's mother, for instance, birthed some
twelve or more children, half of them black children with the black
father, half of them mixed-race children with the white father. Trapped
in immanence in the life of the species, these females essentially
repeat animal life with no horizon beyond it. This motif is [scored into
the fabric of everyday life for bonded women, and, under the
circumstances, it was neither shocking nor unexpected]{.underline} to
the coeval world that they would have been so. Stanley contends that the
flesh of female slaves thus took center stage in abolitionist
propaganda. We recall that [it is the scourged body of the bonded woman
that we most vividly remember]{.underline}, as does Douglass himself,
from the latter's 1845 narrative, and the powerful tale of flight in the
avoidance of sexual persecution that animates the long and torturous
journey of Harriet Jacobs. In accounts tinged with eroticism,
abolitionists across the race divide evoked a corporeal slave economy
that was diametrically opposed to the sexual order of free society in
which female purity, as Harriet Jacobs argued her case, was valued as a
priceless possession. In short, [bonds women]{.underline}, subjected to
the tortures of the [flesh and the discipline of the sexual and laboring
body, become the quintessential image of the terrors of the peculiar
institution.]{.underline} To say then that the bodies of African women
were translated into a kind of data in the struggle for full manhood
rights would match one's understanding of the matter of revolution, even
though their utility, in this regard, would be laced with ironical
accents, given how long their own campaign for the status of subject
would actually last. We could think of black women, then, in their
arduous historical apprenticeship, as the last man standing, the living
embodiment of the crimes of slavery---the crimes of tactility in their
most undiluted form---who modeled, in the flesh, the paradigmatic
chattel. Through her image, abolitionists sanctified, by negation, the
ideal of self-ownership as the essence of freedom. Most immediately,
[the plight of women in enslavement defined the starkest, barest, most
uncompromising terms of what freedom was not. The conditions of enslaved
women therefore marked an actual border]{.underline}, rather than a
fetishized one, and on either side of which, the social order was
organized. Under such conditions, it seems that the erotic and the
sexual are meaningless, except that we recognize them by their absence.
Not protected by the ties of sentiment, which could be interrupted for
any reason, wincingly, often narrowly economic, the enslaved confronted,
in her person, what living was in the absence of love and sex beyond
naked copulation. Not only this, [but the very withdrawal of private and
privacy as a human right, at the same time that the bonded woman
belonged to public history only insofar as she was the ambiguous subject
owned like things by others]{.underline}, what our writers have paid
imaginative witness to is the fact that there is no human loneliness or
loneliness remotely comparable to that of the enslaved, beyond the reach
and scope of love and freedom. [The day that the enslaved decides to act
the threat of death that always hangs over her by risking her life is
the first day of wisdom,]{.underline} and whether or not one survives it
is perhaps less important than the recognition that, unless one is free,
[love cannot and will not matter]{.underline}

#### Black people have been exploited and formed into a subject that lacks humanity. The denial of liberty prevents black people from possessing any form of agency or consent and it becomes impossible. Humanity exposes the enslaved to further violence that perpetuates instances of gratuitous violence.

In light of this, how might we reconsider the performative in order to
illuminate the social relations of slavery and the daily practices of
resistance that traver. See these relations or represent the critical
labor of these practices without reproducing the contented subject of
the pastoral or the heroic actor of the romance of resistance? [To
render everyday practices with any complexity requires a disfigurement
and denaturalization of this history of the subject as
romance]{.underline}., even if the romance of resistance. This requires
that we forgo simply celebrating slave agency and instead endeavor to
[scrutinize and investigate the forms, dispositions, and constraints of
action and the disfigured and liminal status of the agents of such
acts.]{.underline} In contrast to approaches that [foreclose performance
in the troubled frame of autonomy,]{.underline} arrogating to the
enslaved the illusory privileges of the bourgeois subject or
self-possessed individual, or performance as evidence of the harmonious
order of slaveholder hegemony and [the slave\'s consent to that
order]{.underline}, or performance as a reprieve from the horrors of the
system, what is considered here are precisely the ways in which
[performance and other modes of practice are determined by
exploit]{.underline}, and exceed the constraints of domination. [How do
the forms, relations, and institutions of power condition the exercise
of agency?]{.underline} The particular status of the slave as object and
as subject requires a careful consideration of the notion of agency if
one wants to do more than C \'endow\" the enslaved with agency as some
sort of gift dispensed by historians and critics to the dispossessed.
Certainly the constraints of agency are great in this situation, and [it
is difficult to imagine away in which the interpellation of the slave as
subject enables forms of agency that do not reinscribe the terms of
subjugation]{.underline}. Although it has become commonplace in
Foucauldian approaches to power relations to conceptualize agency as an
enabling constraint or an enabling violation, the problem with this
approach is that it assumes that all forms of power are normatively
equiva.. lent, without distinguishing between violence, domination,
force, legitimation, be.. Redressing the Pained Body 55 gemonyt et

domination. the brutal asymmetry of power, the regular exercise of
violence, and [the denial of liberty that make it difficult, if not
impossible, to directone\'s own conduct, let alone the conduct of
others.]{.underline} As Foucault remarks, \"[There cannot be relations
of power]{.underline} \[as opposed to domination\] [unless subjects are
free]{.underline}, If one were completely at the disposition of the
other and became his thing, an object on which he can exercise an
infinite and unlimited violence,there would not relations of power. In
Order To exercise a relation of power, there must be on both sides at
least a certain form of liberty. t, 17Certainly this seriously
challenges facile assertions of slave agency and casts doubt on the
capaciousness of transgression, In a state of domination[; the
operations of power appear more repressive than
productive]{.underline},and the attendant forms of subjection seem
intent upon [preventing the captive from gaining any measure of agency
that is not with punishment, thereby confirming the slave\'s existence
as the object of violence]{.underline}. Thus the question remains as to
what exercise of the will, forms of action, or enactment of possibility
is available to animate chattel or the socially dead or to the excluded
ones that provides the very ground of man\'s liberty.t\" The double
bind, simply stated, is: How does one account for the state of
domination and the possibilities seized in practice? flow does one
represent the various modes of practice without reducing them to
conditions of domination or romanticizing them as pure forces of
resistance? To complicate the picture still further, how docs one makes
any claims about the politics of performance without risking the absurd
when discussing the resistance staged by an unauthorized dance in the
face of the everyday workings of fear, subjugation, and violence? [How
does one calculate or measure such acts in the scope of slavery and its
reasoned and routinized terror,]{.underline} its calibrations of
subjectivity and pain, and the sheer Incommensurability of the force
that it deploys in response to the small challenges waged against it?
Ultimately, the conditions of domination and subjugation determine what
kinds of action are possible 01\' effective, though these acts can be
said to exceed the conditions of domination and are not reducible to
them. [If the forms of power determine what kinds of practices are
possible within a given field, what are the prospects for calculated
action given that the very meaning of slave property is \"being subject
to the master\']{.underline}8 will in all things\' J and that issues of
consent, will, intentionality, and action are utterly meaningless,
except in the instance of \"criminal\" acts. Bearing this in mind, what
possibilities for agency exist that don\'t put the enslaved at risk of a
greater order of pain and punishment since the slave is a legal person
only insofar as he is a criminal and a violated body in need of limited
forms of protection? In this case, the assignation of subject status and
the recognition of [humanity exposes the enslaved to further violence in
the case of criminal agency or require the event of excessive
violence,]{.underline} cruelty beyond the limits of the socially
tolerable, in order to acknowledge and protect the slave\'s person. Is
it possible that such recognition effectively forecloses agency and that
as subject the enslaved is still rendered without will or re inscribed
as the object of punishment?Or is this limited conferral of humanity
merely reinscription of subjugation and pained existence? Does the
designation of \"criminal\' or \"damaged property\" intensify or
alleviate the onus of anguished and liable person? FORMATIONS OF TERROR
AND ENJOYMENT In short, what I am trying to hint at here is the relation
of agent and act-in particular, [the anomalous status of the slave as
subject]{.underline} and the circumscribed action characteristic of this
condition, The cleavage or sundering of the slave as an object of
property,pained flesh,.and unlawful agent situates the enslaved in an
indefinite and paradoxical relation to the normative category
\"person.\' ,. [One must attend to this paradox in order to discern and
evaluate the agency of the enslaved because the forms of action taken do
not transcend this condition but rather are an index of the particular
figurations of power and modes of subjection]{.underline}. Yet it is
also important to remember that strategies of domination don\'t exhaust
all possibilities of intervention, resistance, Of transformation.
Therefore, it is necessary to investigate what possibilities exist given
these determinants, the. myriad and infinitesimal ways in which agency
is exercised, the disposition or probability of certain acts, and the
mechanisms through which these \"ways of operating\" challenge and
undermine the conditions of enslavement. Is the agency of the enslaved
to be located in reiterative acts that undermine and discursively re
elaborate the conditions of subjection and repression!\" Is it founded
upon the desire to\' negate constraint, to restage and remember the
rupture that produced this state of social death, to exceed this
determinate negation through acts of recollection, or to attend to the
needs and desires of the pained body?The difficulties posed in
rethinking the relation of performance and agency are related primarily
to the pervasiveness of the spectacle of black contentment and
abjection, the repressive problematic of will and voluntarism, the
pained, punitive, and burdened constitution of the slave as subject, and
the extreme and violent enactments of power.P? [The dominative
performance of blackness]{.underline} thwarts efforts to [reassess
agency because it has so masterfully simulated black \"will\" only in
order to re anchor subordination]{.underline}. How Does One discern
\"enabling conditions\" [when the very constitution of the subject
renders him socially dead or subversively redeploy an identity
determined by violent domination,]{.underline} dishonor, and natal
alienation? In this case, does redemption rather than repetition become
the privileged figure of the performative?How might it be possible to
dislodge performance and perfonnativity from these closures and
[re-evaluate performance in terms of the claims made against power, the
interruption and undermining of the regulatory norms of racial
slavery,]{.underline} as a way of operatingunder duress and constraint
and as an articulation of utopian and transformative impulses? The
import of the performative, as indicated by those like Toby Jones or
John McAdams,is in the articulation of needs and desires that radically
call into question the order of power and its production of \"cultural
intelligibility\" or \"legible bodies.\"

#### Slaves were stripped of their consent and will by the lack of legal acknowledgement of their traumas and actions except in the case of criminality. Thus, for the slave, personhood and punishment became linked.

**Hartman 97** (Hartman, Saidiya V. Scenes of Subjection: Terror,
Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America. Oxford
University Press, 1997. Pages 18-20 //mms)

In nineteenth-century common law, rape was defined as the forcible
carnal knowledge of a female against her will and without her consent.1
Yet [the actual or attempted rape of an enslaved woman was an offense
neither recognized nor punished by law. Not only was rape simply
unimaginable because of purported black lasciviousness, but also its
repression was essential to the displacement of white culpability that
characterized both the recognition of black humanity in slave law and
the designation of the black subject as the originary locus of
transgression and offense]{.underline}. The cases of State of Missouri
v. Celia, a Slave and George v. State averred that [the enslaved were
not subjects of common law, thus not protected against
rape.]{.underline} In other words, slaves were placed solely under the
regulation of statutory law (slave codes) and not covered by the common
law, though the rape of slave women was not a statutory offense either.
Therefore, the repression or effacement of rape can be explained only in
part by the inapplicability of common law to the enslaved. Rather [the
repression and the negation of this act of violence are central not only
to the pained constitution of blackness but also to the figuration and
the deployment of sexuality in the context of captivity.]{.underline}
Moreover, [the disavowal of rape most obviously involves issues of
consent, agency, and will that are ensnared in a larger dilemma
concerning the construction of person and the calculation of black
humanity in slave law since this repression of violence constitutes
female gender as the locus of both unredressed and negligible injury.
\"The dual invocation of person and property made issues of consent,
will, and agency complicated and ungainly.]{.underline} Yet the law
strove to contain the tensions gener-ated by this seemingly
contradictory invocation of the enslaved as property and person, as
absolutely subject to the will of another, and as actional subject by
relying on the power of feelings or the mutual affection between master
and slave and the strength of weakness or the ability of the dominated
to influence, if not control the dominant[. The dual invocation of the
slave as property and person was an effort to wed reciprocity and
submission, intimacy and domination, and the legitimacy of violence and
the necessity of protection]{.underline}. By the same token, [the law\'s
selective recognition of slave humanity nullified the captive\'s ability
to give consent or act as agent and, at the same time, acknowledged the
intentionality and agency of the slave but only as it assumed the form
of criminality. The recognition and/or stipulation of agency as
criminality served to identify personhood with punishment. Within the
terms of the law, the enslaved was either a will-less object or a
chastened agent.]{.underline}

#### Black trans women are forced to overidentify with performativity to access existence. Denial of not just community but existence as individuals means that understandings of waywardness for black women as a method for understanding community and intergenerational spirtuality and connectivity can never be accessible to black trans women

**Gosset and Huxtable '17** (CHE GOSSETT AND JULIANA HUXTABLE , trans
femme writer, and archivist. They have written extensively on black and
trans visiblility, black trans aesthetics, racial capitalism, and queer,
trans and black radicalism, resistance and abolition, American artist,
writer, performer, DJ, and co-founder of the New York-based nightlife
project Shock Value, Trap Door: Trans Cultural Production and the
Politics of Visibility (Critical Anthologies in Art and Culture)) SO

The following conversation between scholar, activist, and archivist Che
Gossett and artist Juliana Huxtable took place on May 18, 2016, at the
New Museum. CHE GOSSETfl I saw this really great quote that somebody had
made into a .gif. Someone asked you in an interview, "What's the
nastiest shade you've ever thrown?" And you said, "Existing in the
world." I wrote it down, and I was like, okay, this is so powerful, you
know? It struck me. It made me think about black trans politics and
Afropessimism' and the will to live. JULIANA HUXTABLE: That was at a
photo shoot that I was doing. I was kind of apprehensive about doing a
video thing because, at first, it seemed like they were trying to get
everyone to perform in this way that I wasn't in the mood for at the
time[, the sort of performance that Black queers are often asked to
embody---to over-identify with performativity.]{.underline} And so I
didn't know what they were going to ask me. When they asked me that
question, I was like, "Oh, that's actually a really difficult question.
I'll process that." And then I thought about it, and I said, "Existing
in the world," because that's generally how I approach the more
ostensibly "politicized" aspects of my being in the world---sort of like
being the shade---trying to exist in a way where I don't even need to
state the validity or the invalidity or the absurdity of your
discomfort, or whatever it is. At that moment in my life I was dealing
with a lot of explicit transphobia. That was earlier in my hormonal
transition. And so I think that's why that idea resonated with me at
that moment. GOSSETT: Do you feel that there is a black trans radical
tradition? And how might it be defined? H U XTA B L E: Well, it's weird
because, to me, [the word "tradition" implies a hand ing down, or
rituals, hand-me-downs, and traced languages, and documentation of all
that.]{.underline} To me, that's what tradition goes hand in hand with.
And so, [I find it hard to say whether or not there's a black trans
radical tradition.]{.underline} I think that there are---that there have
always been---radical Black trans people and lives and work. But I feel
like, at least up until recently, there wasn't necessarily a tradition.
I think in the moment we're in, with social media, that's one of the
advantages in terms of the visibility question. There are platforms and
profiles dedicated to archiving what's happening in the present, and to
uncovering and highlighting these moments in the past---even if they
were disguised until the contemporary moment. I'm thinking of model
Tracey "Africa" Norman here as a prime example. [She was hidden in plain
sight as a transgender woman breaking barriers before she could be
credited for doing so]{.underline} \... I think social media is
expanding the possibilities for both archiving the present and finding
ways of revisiting and rereading the past so that we can try to form
something that we could perhaps analyze and use to approximate a
"tradition." When I was blogging, that was my outlet. I was using my
blog as a way to try to document and mine books and websites and media
and then share them. And [it was actually hard for me to find basic
documentation of Black trans people.]{.underline} You know, you have
Paris Is Burning \[19901, but at that point, I was like, Oh my god, if I
have to talk about Paris Is Burning again \... That's the only
documentation of what exists? And so, I really feel that a black trans
radical tradition is only being deciphered now. Paris Is Burning and the
ballroom community at large represent a culture that does, very
literally, have a tradition. There's a history; you can trace it and
explore it in the archive. And there's documentation. There are figures
I've kind of become obsessed with. But I was also like, What does it
mean? [Where are the other Black trans intellectuals? Where are the
Black trans activists?]{.underline} Where are the Black trans musicians
and artists? They are very difficult to find. When asked, there are
people that I can think of like Vaginal Davis and Connie Fleming. I
learn more as I go along. But I feel like the tradition is still in the
process of being discovered and articulated. GOSSETT: I think it's
always a retrospective project to create a tradition, and then it gets
documented. HUXTABLE: There's definitely nightlife. Connie Fleming was
one of my trans idols. When I first moved to New York, just being able
to live in this way, against all the expectations of what people
presume, especially as a Black, trans, general femme-spectrum person,
felt radical. Connie and Honey Dijon were some of the first people who
really demanded presence and respect in this way \... I think that's why
I was attracted to nightlife, because there was not a tradition, per se,
but figures I felt proximate to. GOSSETT: That's interesting. Monica
Roberts has a blog called TransGriot that pushes back against historical
erasure. HUXTABLE: Yes, that hove. GOSSETT: Roberts found that Ebony and
Jet used to cover balls in the '50s and '60s, and because of that, the
magazines perform as black trans archives. I thought that was really
interesting. And then other people were like points of light for me and
for so many of us---like the incredible Miss Major.2 There's still work
happening to excavate more of that history. \...There's another person,
Mary Jones, who was the first Black trans woman to get locked up for sex
work in New York in the 1830s; I first learned of her through Tavia
Nyong'o's book The Amalgamation Waltz: Race, Performance, and the Ruses
ofMemory \[University of Minnesota Press, 2009\]. HUXTABLE: hove that it
goes that far back---not that the persecution does, but that the first
documentation of a Black trans sex worker was in the 1830s. GOSSETT:
Yes! I was so interested in her story that, after reading Nyong'o's
book, I ordered a copy of a court transcript where the judge asks Jones,
"How long have you dressed like this?" And she says, "I've always
dressed this way with people of my own color." The "always" is really
interesting because it holds, you know; it spans. Jones was from New
Orleans, so her story made me think a lot about black trans ge nealogies
of resistance and resilience. I think that there's definitely a black
trans radical politics that is also always a plural form of politics.
And I think that in the so-called age of visibility---neoliberal
visibility---your work and other trans art ists' work that pushes at the
critical edges in ways that subvert and, as Gayatri Spivak might say,
"affirmatively sabotage"3 is really powerful. How do you think about
this new, neoliberal, spotlight moment? HUXTABLE: Right, this zeitgeist
moment? Yes, the zeitgeist moment. How do you work within it, or how do
you problematize it? HUXTABLE: I think, in some ways, I have a chip on
my shoulder about the whole thing. It's gotten to the point where
there's this toxic assumption that one would transition in order to be
in the spotlight, in order to gain media vis ibility---literally, just
being visible to sell an idea, like there's something to gain, or maybe
to monetize. It's frustrating because I think that type of visibility is
really strictly monitored. GOSSETT: It's like surveillance. H UXTAB L E:
It's total surveillance. I think there is an actual moment of dynamic
and, in many ways, powerful visibility, and perhaps there are reasons
why it's happening that we can point to. I think there are a lot of
cultural factors in terms of gender variance that are hot-button issues
now. I think, in terms of larger fantasies and narratives around social
progress, visibility just fits into an ideal of where we would be at
this moment; it's the next logical step from third wave feminism or
cyber culture or the juridical advancements of mainstream LGBT rights.
But it's an empty gesture in a lot of ways. And it's a gesture that I'm
always questioning. Are they---meaning the audiences obsessed with and
consuming media about transness---tapping into a derivative pornographic
obsession with transgender bodies? Or are they [putting me on display as
a circus freak show, in a "We're all secretly laughing at
you"]{.underline} sort of way? That's the anxiety that I've gotten from
the whole situation, because I think that the policing and the violence
against trans people have a direct relationship to that increase in
visibility. The people who gain visibility---those whom the media deem
to be relatively "pass able" in one sense or another---end up being used
as examples to police trans people generally. There's this rift that
opens between gender variance and transness as an idea. And I think
that's part of the trap of what's happening in terms of visibility. I
didn't know how to engage the term "trans community": "Are you are
speaking for the trans community? Are you doing this for the trans
community?" And I was like, I don't know what that term means. I have no
clue what the hypotheti cal community is that you're speaking of. I am
developing my own sense of a community as time unfolds, but when I first
started to transition---medically at least, to establish a point of
reference---[I didn't really have a community. I felt like there was no
community]{.underline} \... Maybe online, on Tumbir, but that was just
under the umbrella of queerness more broadly. At that time, [I felt
isolated in my experience as a trans woman]{.underline}. I didn't even
have trans friends. Someone I dated around that time was the first
person close to me who was also trans. When I would meet older trans
women, I would be like, Oh my god, how do you do it? Oh my god, what
about hormones? Oh my god, what about your sex drive? How have you
supported yourself? There was a kind of apprehension, almost a distance
or a dismissive attitude toward me, when I would ask those questions.
And I didn't understand that. But I think it's because so many people of
an earlier generation had to go through so much. To have someone who,
from their perspective, just decides to take estrogen one day and
assumes that those experiences have a shared commonality with what they
went through was almost insulting to these women. They were like, "You
have no clue what I've had to do just to be able to exist in this way."
I feel like I'm having a sort of similar response in relation to the
visibility moment because [I don't know what this community
is.]{.underline} I don't know. And I think a lot of what people speak
about in terms of visibility now is literally press coverage---articles,
photo shoots, interviews---and I don't want that to outpace what I'm
doing in my life, because I got to the point that I'm at without that
moment. And so, it's complicated. And it's also fueling such an intense
backlash because we haven't collectively thought through what the idea
of a trans community is. What is the trans community of the United
States? [I feel like that community is way more ambiguous and undefined
than the Black community, even knowing that that community has so many
manifestations.]{.underline} But there's a history, and there's
documentation, and there's a relationship to media. Just promoting the
idea of visibility is getting ahead of really dealing with the
intricacies of what it means to create a community within ourselves, to
create a community that then engages the outside world with a sense of
cohesion (or not). And that lack of an infrastructure is creating this
self-replicating media cycle. But most people don't know what the term
"trans community" means. I see the people in my family, for example. [I
have members of my family from the South who, if I weren't their family
member, would probably beat the shit out of me if they met me in a
bar,]{.underline} you know? I know that. I'm living in that reality. And
so, it's crazy to function in the mode of visibility.

### 1NC -- Link - Coalitions

#### Coalition allow for white and nonblack voices to be put at the front subverting the goal of the black advocate. They never understand their positionality with black people which leads to them perpetuating the forms of violence they are critiquing. Inevitably the coalition is doomed to fail as the interest of black people are put to the back burner.

SO]{.mark}

The major mistake made by exponents of the coalition theory is that they
advocate alliances with groups which have never had as their central
goal the necessarily total revamping of the society. At bottom, those
groups accept the American system and want only?if at all?to make
peripheral, marginal reforms in it. Such [reforms are inadequate to rid
the society of racism.]{.underline} Here we come back to an important
point made in the first chapter: the overriding sense of superiority
that pervades white America. \"Liberals,\" no less than others, are
subjected and subject to it; t[he white liberal must view the racial
scene through a drastically different lens from the black
man\'s]{.underline}. Killian and Grigg were correct when they said in
Racial Crisis in America: . . . [most white Americans, even those white
leaders who at tempt to communicate and cooperate with their Negro
counter parts, do not see racial inequality in the same way that the
Negro does]{.underline}. The white person, no matter how liberal he may
be, exists in the cocoon of a white-dominated society. [Living in a
white residential area]{.underline}, sending his children to white
schools, moving in exclusively white social circles, he must exert a
special effort to expose himself to the actual conditions under which
large numbers of Negroes live. Even when such exposure, [his perception
is likely to be superficial and distorted]{.underline}. The substandard
house may be overshadowed in his eyes by the television aerial or the
automobile outside the house. Even more important, [he does not perceive
the subjective inequalities in herent in the system of segregation
because he does not experience them daily as a Negro does.]{.underline}
Simply stated, the white Amer ican lives almost all of his life in a
white world. The Negro American lives a large part of his life in a
white world also, but in a world in which he is stigmatized \[p. 73\].
Our point is that no matter how \"liberal\" a white person might be, he
cannot ultimately escape the overpowering influence? on himself and on
black people?of his whiteness in a racist society [Liberal whites often
say that they are tired of being told \"you can\'t understand what it is
to be black.\" They claim to recognize and acknowledge this. Yet the
same liberals will often turn around and tell black people that they
should ally themselves with those who can\'t understand]{.underline},
who share a sense of superiority based on whiteness. [The fact is that
most of these \"allies\" neither look upon the blacks as co-equal
partners nor do they perceive the goals as any but the adoption of
certain Western norms and values.]{.underline} Professor Milton M.
Gordon, in his book, Assimilation in American Life, has called those
values \"An glo-conformity\" (p. 88). Such a view assumes the
\"desirability of maintaining English institutions (as modified by the
Ameri can Revolution), the English language, and English-oriented
cultural patterns as dominant and standard in American life.\" Perhaps
one holding these views is not a racist in the strict sense of our
original definition, but the end result of his attitude is to sustain
racism. As Gordon says: The non-racist Anglo-conformists presumably are
either convinced of the cultural superiority of Anglo-Saxon institutions
as developed in the United States, or believe simply that regardless of
superiority or inferiority, since English culture has constituted the
dominant framework for the development of American institutions,
newcomers should expect to adjust accordingly \[pp. 103-104\]. [We do
not believe it possible to form meaningful coalitions unless both or all
parties are not only willing but believe it absolutely necessary to
challenge Anglo-conformity and other prevailing norms and
institutions.]{.underline} Most liberal groups with which we are
familiar are not so willing at this time. If that is the case, then [the
coalition is doomed to frustration and failure.]{.underline} The
Anglo-conformity position assumes that what is good for
America?whites?is good for black people. We reject this. The Democratic
Party makes the same claim. But the political and social rights of black
people have been and always will be negotiable and expendable the moment
they conflict with the interests of their \"allies.\" A clear example of
this can be found in the city of Chicago, where Mayor Daley\'s
Democratic \"coil spring 2008 173\" machine depends on black support and
unfortunately black people vote consistently for that machine. Note the
results, as described by Banfield and Wilson in City Politics: The civic
projects that Mayor Daley inaugurated in Chicago? street cleaning,
street lighting, road building, a new airport, and a convention hall,
for example?were shrewdly chosen. They were highly visible; they
benefited the county as well as the city; for the most part they were
noncontroversial; they did not require much increase in taxes; and they
created many moderately paying jobs that politicians could dispense as
patronage. The mayor\'s program conspicuously neglected the goals of
militant Negroes, demands for the enforcement of the building code, and
(until there was a dramatic expose) complaints about police in
efficiency and corruption. These things were all controversial, and,
perhaps most important, would have no immediate, visible result; either
they would benefit those central-city voters whose loyalty could be
counted upon anyway or else (as in the case of police reform) they
threatened to hurt the machine in a vital spot \[p. 124; au Thor\'s
italics\]. [As long as the black people of Chicago]{.underline}?and the
same can be said of cities throughout the country?[remain politically
dependent on the Democratic machine, their interests will be secondary
to that machine.]{.underline} Organized labor is another example of a
potential ally who has never deemed it essential to question the
society\'s basic values and institutions. The earliest advocates of
unionism believed in the doctrine of laissez faire. The labor organizers
of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) did not want the government to
become involved in labor\'s problems, and probably for good reason. The
government then?in the 1870\'s and 1880\'s? was anti-labor,
pro-management. It soon became clear that political power would be
necessary to accomplish some of the goals of organized labor, especially
the goals of the railroad unions. The AFL pursued that power and
eventually won it, but generally remained tied to the values and
principles of the society as it was. They simply wanted in; the route
lay through collective bargaining and the right to strike. The unions
set their sights on immediate bread-and-butter issues, to the exclusion
of broader goals. With the founding and development of mass industrial
unionism under the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), we began
to see a slight change in overall union orientation. The CIO was
interested in a wider variety of issues?foreign trade, interest rates,
even civil rights issues to an extent?but it too never seriously
questioned the racist basis of the society. In Politics, Parties and
Pressure Groups, Professor V. O. Key, Jr. has concluded: \"\... on the
fundamental question of the character of the economic system, the
dominant labor ideology did not chal lenge the established order.\"
Professor Selig Perlman wrote: \"\... it is a labor movement upholding
capitalism, not only in practice, but in principle as well.\"3 Organized
labor, so often pushed as a potential ally by the coalition theorists,
illustrates the pits THE MYTHS OF COALITION falls of the first myth; as
we shall see later in this chapter, its history also debunks the second
myth. Yet another source of potential alliance frequently cited by the
exponents of coalitions is the liberal-reform movement, especially at
the local political level. But the various reform-politics
groups?particularly in New York, Chicago and California?[frequently are
not tuned in to the primary goals of black people. They establish their
own goals and then demand that black people identify with
them.]{.underline} When black leaders begin to articulate goals in the
interest of black people first, the reform ers tend, more often than
not, to term this \"racist\" and to drop off. [Reformers push such
\"good government\" programs as would result in posts being filled by
professional, middle-class people.]{.underline} Wilson stated in The
Amateur Democrat, \"Blue-ribbon candidates would be selected, not only
for the important, highly visible posts at the top of the ticket, but
also for the less visible posts at the bottom\" (p. 128). Black people
who have participated in local reform politics?especially in Chicago?
have come from the upper-middle class. [Reformers generally reject the
political practice of ticket balancing, which means that they tend to be
\"color blind\" and wish to select candidates only on the basis of
qualifications,]{.underline} of merit. In itself this would not be bad,
but [their conception of a \"qualified\" person is usually one who fits
the white middle-class mold.]{.underline} Seldom, if ever, does one hear
of the reformers advocating representation by grass-roots leaders from
the ghettos: these are hardly \"blue-ribbon\" types. Again, when
reformers push for elections at large as opposed to election by
district, they do not increase black political power. \"Blue-ribbon\"
candidates, government by technical experts, elections at large?all
these common innovations of reformers do little for black people.
Francis Carney concludes from his study of California\'s lib eral-reform
Democratic clubs4 that although those groups were usually strong on
civil rights, they were nonetheless essentially middle-class oriented.
This could only perpetuate a paternalistic, colonial relationship?doing
for the blacks. Thus, [even when the reformers are bent on making
significant changes in the system, the question must be asked if that
change is consistent with the views and interests of black
people?]{.underline}as perceived by those people. Frequently, we have
seen that a staunch, militant stand taken by black leaders has
frightened away the reformers. The latter could not understand the
former\'s militancy. \"Amateur Democrats (reformers) are passionately
committed to a militant stand on civil rights, but they shy away from
militant Negro or ganizations because they find them \'too
race-conscious\'\" (p. 285), says Wilson in The Amateur Democrat, citing
as one exam ple the Independent Voters of Illinois, who felt they could
not go along with the desire of some black members to take a very
strong, pro-civil rights and anti-Daley position. The liberal-re form
politicians have not been able fully to accept the necessity of black
people speaking forcefully and for themselves to one of the greatest
points of tension between these two sets of groups today; this
difference must be resolved before viable coalitions can be formed
between the two. To sum up our rejection of the first myth: As we
established in Chapters I and II, the political and economic
institutions of this society must be completely revised if the political
and economic status of black people is to be improved. We do not see how
those same institutions can be utilized?through the mechanism of
coalescing with some of them?to bring about that revision. [We do not
see how black people can form effective coalitions with groups which are
not willing to question and condemn the racist institutions which
exploit black people; which do not perceive the need for, and will not
work for, basic change]{.underline}. Black people cannot afford to
assume that what is good for white-America is automatically good for
black people.

**On being 'in-it**': Women and globality

[Black and third world feminists have provided powerful critiques of the
way in which Western feminism]{.underline} has defined the universal in
terms of the West. Such universalist feminist approaches [often
proceed\[s\] through producing 'third world women' as objects of
knowledge. Chandra Talpade Mohanty suggests that the constitution of
third world women as a homogenous group is a means by which Western
feminists represent themselves as subjects of knowledge: a homogenous
notion of the oppression of women as a group is assumed, which, in turn,
produces the image of an 'average third world woman'. This average third
world woman leads to an essentially truncated life based on her feminine
gender (read: sexually constrained) and her being 'third world' (read:
ignorant, poor, uneducated, tradition-bound, domestic, family-oriented,
victimized etc.).]{.underline} This, I suggest, is in contrast to the
(implicit) self-representation of Western women as educated, as modern,
as having control over their own bodies and sexualities, and the freedom
to make their own decisions. [(Mohanty 1991: 56) Mohanty examines the
way in which Western feminists authorise themselves to speak of third
world women, as if they are a singular group (in need of liberation),
and hence tend to speak for them. Crucially, Mohanty demonstrates that
the act of speaking of and for third world women involves a form of
self-representation. Third world women come to define not simply what
Western women are not (and hence what they are), but also what they once
were, before feminism allowed Western women to be
emancipated.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Link - Seduction

#### **The slave was seen as inherently seductive and this was used to justify rape**

**Hartman 97** (Hartman, Saidiya V. Scenes of Subjection: Terror,
Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America. Oxford
University Press, 1997. Pages 18-20 //mms)

[The construction of black subjectivity as will-less, abject, insatiate,
and pained and the instrumental deployment of sexuality in the
reproduction of property, subor-dination, and racial difference usurped
the category of rape. Sexuality formed the nexus in which black, female,
and chattel were inextricably bound and acted to intensify the
constraints of slave status by subjecting the body to another order of
violations and whims.]{.underline}32 The despotic ravages of [power made
violence indistinguish-able from the full enjoyment of the
thing]{.underline}. The tensions generated by the law\'s dual invocation
of property and person,01 by full enjoyment and limited protection to
life and limb, were masked by the phantasmal ensnaring agency of the
lascivious black.33 [Rape disappeared through the intervention of
seduction the assertion of the slave woman\'s complicity and willful
submission. Seduction]{.underline} was central to the very constitution
and imagination of the antebellum South for it [provided a way of
masking the antagonistic fissures of the social by ascribing to the
object of property an ensnaring and criminal agency that acted to
dissimulate the barbarous forms of white enjoyment permitted within the
law.]{.underline} [The discourse of seduction enabled those disgusted
and enraged by the sexual arrangements of slavery]{.underline}, like
Mary Boykin Chesnut, [to target slave women as the agents of their
husbands\' downfall. The complicity of slave women displaced the act of
sexual violence]{.underline}. According to Chesnut, decent white women
were forced to live with husbands degraded by the lowliness of their
enslaved \"mistresses\": \"Under slavery we lived surrounded by
prostitutes, yet an abandoned woman is sent out of any decent house. Who
thinks any worse of a Negro or mulatto woman for being a thing we can\'t
name?\"34 [The sexual exploitation of the enslaved female,
incredu-lously, served as evidence of her collusion with the master
class and as evidence of her power, the power both to render the master
weak and, implicitly, to be the mistress of her own
subjection]{.underline}. The slave woman not only suffered the
responsibility for her sexual (ab)use but also was blameworthy because
of her purported ability to render the powerful weak. Even those like
Fanny Kemble, who eloquently described the \"simple horror and misery\"
that slave women regularly experienced, were able to callously exclaim,
when confronted with the inescapable normativity of rape and the
\"string of detest-able details\" that comprised the life of enslaved
women, after yet another woman, Sophy, shared her experience of
violation: "Ah! But don\'t you know---did nobody ever teach any of you
that it is a sin to live with men who are not your husbands?!" 3 Sophy,
appropriately and vehemently, responded, \"Oh, yes, missis, we know- we
know all about dat well enough; but we do anything to get our poor flesh
some rest from the whip; when he made me follow him into de bush, what
use me tell him no? He have strength tomakeme.\''36 [The equivocations
that surround issues of consensual sexual relations under domi-nation,
the eliding of sexual violence by the\' imputation of the slave woman\'s
ensnaring sexual agency or lack of virtue and the presumption of consent
as a consequence of the utter powerlessness of her \"no\" (the \"no
means yes\" philosophy) are important constituents of the discourse of
seduction]{.underline}. In a more expansive or generic sense, [seduction
denotes a theory of power that demands the absolute and \"perfect\"
submission of the enslaved as the guiding principle of slave relations
and yet seeks to mitigate the avowedly necessary brutality of slave
relations through the shared affections of owner and captive. The
doctrine of \"perfect submission'' reconciled violence and the claims of
mutual benevolence between master and slave as necessary in maintaining
the harmony of the institution]{.underline}. The presumed mutuality of
feelings in maintaining domination enchanted the brutal and direct
violence of master-slave relations. Bearing this in mind, [the term
\"seduction\" is employed here to designate this displacement and
euphemization of violence, for seduction epito-mizes the discursive
alchemy that shrouds direct forms of violence under the \"veil of
enchanted relations\"-that is, the reciprocal and mutual relations of
master and slave. This mining of the discourse of seduction attempts to
illuminate the violence obscured by the veil through an interrogation of
the language of power and feelings, specifically the manipulations of
the weak and the kind heartedness and moral instruction of the
powerful.]{.underline}

#### The will of slaves is portrayed by the master as seduction, but that will can still be used to challenge the creation of the subject.

**Hartman 97** (Hartman, Saidiya V. Scenes of Subjection: Terror,
Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America. Oxford
University Press, 1997. Pages 18-20 //mms)

The events that lead to Sukie\'s sale as well as the event staged on the
auction block raise a number of issues critical to the scene of
subjection, the foremost of these being the issues of [will, agency, and
consent,]{.underline} which, in this particular instance, [are emplotted
as seduction]{.underline} -from [Berry\'s description of the master\'s
attempted rape as \"trying to make Sukie his gal,\"]{.underline} which
[illustrates the conflation of rape and concu-binage in the sexual
economy of slavery, to Sukie\'s threatening striptease, in which the
interdiction, ironically, is issued as invitation]{.underline}. The next
set of issues concerns the capacities of the performative in doing (as
in making) and undoing the subject and, lastly, the status of the
enslaved as a curious hybrid of person and property. Let us first
consider the issue of will as it relates to seduction. In one respect,
[Sukie\'s performance can be understood as an arrogation of the will
that undermines her social existence as an object of property. This
dramatic seizure of the will]{.underline} figuratively [expropriates the
power of the]{.underline} (would-be) [master that animates and annexes
the captive body]{.underline}. In this regard, [Sukie's actions place
her outside the law because she defies the fundamental tenet of slavery
the slave is subject to the master's will in all things]{.underline}.
This breach of law enacted in the insolent disregard of the block\'s
decorum, interestingly enough, provides the only possibility for the
emer-gence of the subject, since criminality is the only form of slave
agency recognized by law. Thus [the fashioning of the subject must
necessarily take place in violation of the law, and consequently, will,
criminality and punishment are inextricably linked]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [Sukie\'s performance exploits the charged linkage of
property and sexuality, challenges the will-lessness of the object of
property]{.underline}; and induces a category crisis for the spectators
whose enjoyment is defined by wanton acts and the promiscuous uses of
property.

### 1NC - Link---Black Women

#### Black women do not possess a singular identity, but it is rather the connection of personal relations that unite them. The non-linearity of a black woman's energy captures the interpersonal. It is without a name because it doesn't seek a future -- it cannot be explained. 

**Hammad 11** \[Lamia Khalil Hammad, Black Feminist Discourse of Power

Literature, Post-Colonial and Cultural Studies; Ph.D.:  Literature and
Criticism, USA. (2001)(Ethnicity, Gender, Race,

Much of the 'emotional' theme in for colored girls [centers on
'interpersonal' relations]{.underline} expressed in the choreopoem
through representations for heterosexual relationships, from the
post-finishing-high-school defloration in the back of a buick, to the
end of an affair that: "waz an experiment/ to see how selfish I cd be/
if I wd really carry on to snare a possible lover/ if I waz capable of
debasing my self for the love of another". But, depressing though
several of these poems are, especially "a nite with beau Willie brown"
for colored girls is [not predominantly concerned with the victimization
of black women but with finding the young black women's voice and
self.]{.underline} Shange [writes as a woman for women trying to find a
woman's voice, and "writes the body"]{.underline} in the manner in which
Julia Kristeva talks of it. Her [use of language de-struct(ure)s
literary and theatrical conventions as a means of foregrounding "the
body", emotions and the workings of the unconscious.]{.underline} Thse
may function as if [the body and the speech are
interconnected:]{.underline} Shange's system of spelling as detailed
here is thus dictated by the body. As a choreopoem, for colored girls
[combines music, song, dance and poetry.]{.underline} [What these four
elements have in common is that their systems of signification
foreground the characteristics of Kristeva's semiotic disposition, being
rhythmic, repetitive, non-linear and complex in their form as well as
indeterminate in their meaning, resonating the fluidity of women's
writing of the body.]{.underline} As such, they stand in direct relation
to the semiotic 'chora' which denotes "an essentially mobile and
extremely provisional articulation constituted by movements and their
ephemeral stases".They [signal the expression of "discrete quantities of
energy" which "move through the body" in an as yet non-signifying
manner.]{.underline} The body, through its drives and movements, and the
body creates "the ordering principle of the semiotic chora[". The
disposition of the semiotic outlook as an utterance expresses the self
as body, or body as self.]{.underline} The [semiotic characteristic is
disruptive of all structures created by self because the self is
recreated through the changing reflexes of the semiotic body
movements]{.underline}. It refuses their [norms and set]{.underline}ting
[up the self as a counter-authority]{.underline}. The [choreography is
thus self-affirming rather than self-denying]{.underline}. It signals
[the body that will not be denied. Shange, through the four-fold
foregrounding of the semiotic by combining poetry, dance, song, and
music, 'writes the body' all-pervadingly]{.underline}. It is thus
inevitable that at the end of for colored girls the young black woman
should "find god in herself and love her fiercely"; this is what the
choreopoem drives towards- literally and metaphorically. Shange's [black
woman's self]{.underline} gradually [emerges as a separate, discrete
entity,]{.underline} a new formation signaling independence and love of
self. Another aspect is naming which belongs to the symbolic order, and
optimizes social mobility. Not naming is therefore one way of refusing
the symbolic order and thus the categorizations that dominate society.
It is important in this context that ['choreo' refers not only to dance
but also to the group]{.underline}, which in for colored girls is an
anonymous group of seven ladies, differentiated by color of dress rather
than name. [Without a name which gives a specific identity they can
move]{.underline} literally, for the individual poems in for colored
girls are separated from each other by the re-grouping of the
performers- into and out of identities which they inhabit for the space
of a particular poem or section. This ability to change roles indicates
the possibility of change per se; [the young black woman is not fixed in
a rol]{.underline}e in the same way that the performers are not. [She
can move on, change through the body]{.underline}; it is for this reason
that for colored girls [offers movement, instability, the subject is in
process/ on trial, or in the making, that is the "the semiotic" as form
and content.]{.underline}

### 1NC - Link---Black Woman Alterity

#### The 1AC's attachment to alterity of black women and expression of visual, psychological, and ontological difference hides the potential for sexuality and motherhood from black women in dominant structures of antiblackness which justifies the disciplining of black women's flesh by white men which becomes internalized within black women rendering any action impotent

**Musser 2014** (Amber Jamilla, Associate Professor of Women, Gender,
and Sexuality studies at Washington University in St. Louis Sensational
Flesh: Race, Power, and Masochism, NYU Press, Conclusion, C.A.)//e-toth

**Note: This is distinct from the previous evidence since it's
specifically about alterity not attachment to the wound and has a
different impact to pornotroping (this also needs to be really heavily
highlighted)**

[The black woman functions, Spillers argues, not only as a marker of
difference but as a route for others to experience that
difference.]{.underline} In "Interstices," she writes, ["\[The black
woman\] became instead the principal point of passage between the human
and the non-human world. Her issue became the focus of a cunning
difference---visually, psychologically, ontologically---as the route by
which the dominant male decided the distinction between humanity and
'other.'"19 Further, she adds, "While there are numerous references to
the black woman in the universe of signs, many of them perverted, the
prerogatives of sexuality are refused her because t**he concept of
sexuality originates in, stays with, the dominative mode of culture and
its elaborate strategies of thought and expression.**]{.underline}"20
Even as [black female bodies are sexualized because of their
relationship to difference]{.underline} (as it is produced by various
hierarchies of domination), [sexuality is foreclosed for black women,
just as motherhood i]{.underline}s.21 I will return to thinking about
this linkage between sexuality and maternity later in the text, but what
I want to emphasize in this discussion of Spillers is the way [black
women's alterity becomes coded as sexually available flesh, what
Spillers calls "pornotroping." This is the wound and flattening that
slavery produces. Through this process, however, representation also
becomes its own wound]{.underline}.22 The assumption of marginalization
works in tandem with the very structures of oppression that it is
attempting to highlight and subvert. [This produces a double bind in
which subjects attempt to avoid these flattening processes but end up
with a different set of constrained behavioral choices. Most notably, we
can see this tension in Patricia Hill Collins's critique of "controlling
images." Controlling images are representations of black women that hew
to "racial-sexual mythologies."]{.underline}23 Varying widely in scope,
[they depict black women as "licentious, animalistic, libidinous
Jezebels; as asexual, comical, masculinized Mammies; or as tough,
detached, 'strongblackwomen.'"24 Collins argues that these images
proliferate because they justify the continued disciplining of black
women and black female sexuality as linked to the "moral and fiscal
'deterioration of the state."]{.underline}25 In her critique of the
various forms of marginalization that these images enact, [Collins seeks
to distance representations of black female subjects and sexuality from
them, which is to say that she ends up advocating for self-discipline in
order to prevent disciplining from the outside]{.underline}. Walker's
emphasis on flatness, then, plays both with and against these tensions.
She calls attention to the processes that fix and flatten black female
sexuality, but her relationship to these images is ambiguous. Is her
tableau a critique of this process, or do these representations
reinscribe them? These are central questions in thinking about the
reception of Walker's art and the production of her fame. In 1997, the
year that Walker was awarded the MacArthur Grant, Betye Saar, an artist
known for exploring how cultural images circulate, began a
letter-writing campaign against her work. Saar's letter asked: "Are
African-Americans being betrayed under the guise of art?"26 Responding
in support of Saar's campaign, another critic, Michael Harris, writes,
"When we become artists who use Pickaninnies as a means to develop
notoriety and artistic success, there's no need for a Klan. There's no
need for any kind of racist opposition because they are so Stockholmed
to the point where we will begin to oppress ourselves if we're not
careful."27 [In addition to voicing anxiety that representations of the
past might cloud the present and further reify notions of black flesh as
other, these criticisms speak to the policing of representations of
blackness so as to avoid the problem of injury]{.underline}. These
critics view Walker as trafficking in woundedness. As English argues,
[their critiques suggest that "the motivation behind work like Walker's
is perceived to be anachronistic in itself, like a fragment of slavery
carried over unmodified into the present."]{.underline}28 Further,
English makes clear the link between representation, historic wounds,
and present injury when he writes, "In order to be communicable, the
notion that Walker's work virtually reimplements slavery, or its
operative psychologizations, requires a contemporary perceiver who
enjoys an unbroken view of the institution and its mechanisms, who can
picture them."29 Given the fraught nature of representation, it is clear
why Walker's silhouettes have ignited firestorms. [Since black female
subjectivity has been reduced to flatness either because of the process
of othering or as a tactic of self-disciplining, Walker's silhouettes
carry a lot of representational weight. Since they do not conform to
idealized models of blackness, they ask the viewer to look more closely,
thus making their opacity and dependence on the viewer's projection more
overt.]{.underline}

### 1NC - Link---Empathetic Identification

#### Their presentation of the spectacle of blackness serves as point of empathetic identification mediated by the ballot---their traumatic narrative of ontological lack makes blackness an empty receptacle for the master's meaning, consolidating the slave's place in an economy of white feelings. This is a solvency turn and an independent reason to prefer the alternative. Black suffering must be legitimized by a white spectator AND the deployment of black pain is spectacularized and naturalized abjection

**HARTMAN** Associate Professor of English @ UC BERKLEY **1997** Saidiya
V.- "SCENCES OF SUBJECTION: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in
Nineteenth-Century America"; pp. 20-21

As well, [we need ask why the site of suffering so readily lends itself
to inviting identification. Why is pain the conduit of identification?
This question may seem to beg the obvious, given the violent domination
and dishonor constitutive of enslavement, the acclaimed transformative
capacities of pain in sentimental culture, the prevalence of public
displays of suffering inclusive of the pageantry of the trade, the
spectacle of punishment, circulating reports of slavery's
horrors,]{.underline} the runaway success of *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, and
the passage through the "bloodstained gate," which was a convention of
the slave narrative[, all of which contributed to the idea that the
feelings and consciousness of the enslaved were most available at this
site. However, what I am trying to suggest is that if the scene of
beating readily lends itself to an identification with the enslaved, it
does so at the risk of fixing and naturalizing this condition of pained
embodiment and, in complete defiance of Rankin's good intention,
increases the difficulty of beholding black suffering since the endeavor
to bring pain close exploits the spectacle of the body in pain and oddly
confirms the spectral character of suffering and the inability to
witness the captive's pain. If, on one hand, pain extends humanity to
the dispossessed and the ability to sustain suffering leads to
transcendence, on the other, the spectral and spectacular character of
this suffering]{.underline}**,** or, [in other words, the shocking and
ghostly presence of pain, effaces and restricts black
sentience.]{.underline} As Rankin himself states[, in order for this
suffering to induce a reaction and stir feelings, it must be brought
close. Yet if sentiment or morality are "inextricably tied to human
proximity,"]{.underline} to quote Zygmunt Bauman, [the problem is that
in the very effort to "bring it near" and "inspect it closely" it is
dissipated.]{.underline} According to Bauman, "morality conforms to the
law of optical perspective. It looms large and thick close to the eye."
So, then, how does suffering elude or escape us in the very effort to
bring it near? It does so precisely because [it can only be brought near
by way of a proxy and]{.underline} by way of Rankin's indignation and
[imagination.]{.underline} [If the black body is the vehicle of the
other's power, pleasure, and profit, then it is no less true that it is
the white or near-white body that makes the captive's suffering visible
and discernible. Indeed, the elusiveness of black suffering can be
attributed to a racist optics in which black flesh is itself identified
as the source of opacity, the denial of black humanity, and the
effacement of sentience integral to the wanton use of the captive
body.]{.underline} And as noted earlier, [this is further complicated by
the repressive underside of an optics of morality that insists upon the
other as a mirror of the self and that in order to recognize suffering
must substitute the self for the other.]{.underline} While Rankin
attempts to ameliorate the insufficiency of feeling before the spectacle
of the other's suffering, this insufficiency is, in fact, displaced
rather than remedied by his standing in. Likewise, [this attempt
exacerbates the distance between the readers and those suffering by
literally removing the slave from view as pain is brought close.
Moreover, we need to consider whether the identification forged at the
site of suffering confirms black humanity at the peril of reinforcing
racist assumptions of limited sentience, in that the humanity of the
enslaved and the violence of the institution can only be brought into
view by extreme examples of incineration and dismemberment or by placing
white bodies at risk.]{.underline} What does it mean that the violence
of slavery or pained existence of the enslaved, if discernible, is only
so in the most heinous and grotesque examples and not in the quotidian
routines of slavery? As well, is not the difficulty of empathy related
to both the devaluation and the valuation of black life? [Empathic
identification is complicated further by the fact that it cannot be
extricated from the economy of chattel slavery with which it is at odds,
for this projection of one's feeling upon or into the object of property
and the phantasmic slipping into captivity, while it is distinct from
the pleasures of self-augmentation yielded by the ownership of the
captive body and the expectations fostered therein, is nonetheless
entangled with this economy and identification facilitated by a kindred
possession or occupation of the captive body]{.underline}, albeit on a
different register. [In other words]{.underline}, what I am trying to
isolate are the kinds of expectations and the qualities of affect
distinctive to the economy of slavery. [The relation between pleasure
and the possession of slave property, in both the figurative and literal
senses, can be explained in part by the fungibility of the
slave]{.underline}-that is, the augmentation of the master subject
through his embodiment in external objects and persons. Put differently,
[the fungibility of the commodity makes the captive body an abstract and
empty vessel vulnerable to the projection of others' feelings, ideas,
desires, and values; and, as property, the dispossessed body of the
enslaved is the surrogate for the master's body since it guarantees his
disembodied universality and acts as the sign of his power and dominion.
Thus, while the beaten and mutilated body presumably establishes the
brute materiality of existence, the materiality of suffering regularly
eludes (re)cognition by virtue of the body's being replaced by other
signs of value, as well as other bodies. Thus the desire to don, occupy,
or possess blackness or the black body as a sentimental resource and/or
locus of excess enjoyment is both founded upon and enabled by the
material relations of chattel slavery.]{.underline} In light of this, is
it too extreme or too obvious to suggest that Rankin's flight of
imagination and the excitements engendered by suffering might also be
pleasurable? Certainly this willing abasement confirms Rankin's moral
authority, but what about the pleasure engendered by this embrace of
pain-that is the tumultuous passions of the flightly imagination stirred
by this fantasy of being beaten? Rankin's imagined beating is immune
neither to the pleasures to be derived from the masochistic fantasy nor
to the sadistic pleasure to be derived from [the spectacle of
sufferance]{.underline}. Here [my intention is]{.underline} not to shock
or exploit the perverse but [to consider critically the complicated
nexus of terror and enjoyment by examining the obviated and debased
diversions of the capricious master;]{.underline} the pleasure of
indignation yielded before the spectacle of sufferance; the instability
of the scene of suffering[; and the confusion of]{.underline} song and
sorrow typical of the coffle, the auction block, [performing before the
master,]{.underline} and other popular amusements.

### 1NC - Link---Generic Identity Politics

vulnerability, needing other people]{.underline}. Cedric Robinson speaks
of a principle of incompleteness in communities in Africa, and
elsewhere, in his great book [Terms of
Order](http://www.sunypress.edu/p-832-the-terms-of-order.aspx). I also
remember this amazing moment where [Albert Woodford is asked why he
continued to think of himself as a Panther through all the years of
confinement in Angola Prison even as the Panthers seemed to fade into
history and commodification. He said he needed them.]{.underline} This
most extraordinary figure who might otherwise be narrated as a lone,
brave unbreakable singular man of principle, [talks about himself very
differently, as needing others, as being incomplete]{.underline}.Of
course entrepreneurs --- the contemporary settlers --- don't need
anyone. Consultants --- contemporary hanging judges --- don't need
anyone. And business education in this sense remains a false totality,
and our students remain subjected to this total education of
entrepreneurship and consultancy, customer relations and market
research. All of which hides the massive infrastructure, the massive
logistics operations is necessary for these entrepreneurs, consultants,
and [settlers]{.underline} to [entertain their delusion that they are
self-sufficient, self-authoring, sovereign.]{.underline} But all
disciplines and every aspect of the university is involved in
[perpetuating this delusion of the individuate sovereign
student/entrepreneur/artist/settler, not just the classroom, but
admissions, career services, sports, student life, placements and
internships, and alumni offices]{.underline}. All of them [instructing
students in the conduct of every aspect of being a supplicant to
capital, every aspect of bodily conduct, conduct of thought, and conduct
with others (starting with the instruction to act as if one has an
individualized, self-sufficient body and mind for purposes of conduct
with others and improvement of oneself).]{.underline} And of course the
students go back to their neighborhoods where the police instruct on
conduct, where Chipotle and Burger King instruct on conduct.  Medicine,
sex, exercise everything instructed as conduct for supplication. PhD
programs send out the first books to newly accepted students not on the
subject matter but on how to survive graduate school and get an alt-ac
job! But of course the greatest instruction is simply the daily routines
imposed upon anyone who wants to be a college or university student and
is not part of the haute bourgeoisie (they are subjected to their own
version of the total education, one that harms not only them but
others). The hectic, impossible schedules, the credit card debt budgets,
the shit transportation, and the useless homework assignments carry out
their own instruction in practice. So how can we avoid contributing as
teachers and university workers to this total education? How can we join
with the only force of resistance to all this delusional individuated
sovereignty? That is, how can we join with the students?I [think a
partial education abandons impartiality not in favor of critique but
precisely through the insistence that the 'total' is less and more than
one.]{.underline} And what this means is that [some of this total is
really our thing]{.underline}. I am not saying we do not have to be
concerned with their shit, with this attempt at the imposition of
conduct, of a total education. [But rather that we can do so from our
thing, through an ongoing vigilance about what is not ours, and a
cultivation and love for what is ours.]{.underline} And here an
important point should be made about a partial education. Their total
education always becomes more and less than one, and any time they make
it one, [any time they try to make it total, we can make less and more
of it. But our thing also divides in another way (]{.underline}in a way
unfaithful to Mao but nonetheless). My friend Denise Ferreira da Silva
has already shown us how: [difference without
separability.]{.underline} Or we might say partial education is
[sisterhood and brotherhood of, with, and for the general
antagonism.]{.underline}

#### **Identity politics is created through the desire for recognition which entrenches the aff in ressentiment**

**Brown 93** \[Wendy, Prof. Pol Sci @ Berkeley, "Wounded Attachments,"
*Political Theory*, Vol. 21 No. 3 (Aug), p. 390-1\]

MANY HAVE ASKED HOW, given the totalizing regulatory and \"othering\"
characteristics of identity in/as language, identity can avoid
reiterating such effects in its ostensibly emancipatory mode.\' I want
to ask a similar question but in a historically specific, cultural and
political register not because the linguistic frame is unimportant but
because it is insufficient for discerning the character of contemporary
[politicized identity\'s problematic investments]{.underline}. There are
two levels to this inquiry. First, given the subjectivizing conditions
of identity production in a late modern liberal, capitalist, and
disciplinary-bureaucratic social order, [how can reiteration of these
conditions be averted in identity\'s purportedly emancipatory project?
What kind of political recognition can identity-based claims seek-and
what kind can they be counted on to want-that will not resubordinate the
subject itself historically subjugated through identity categories such
as \"race\" or \"sex,\" especially when these categories operate within
discourses of liberal essentialism and disciplinary
normalization?]{.underline} Second, given the averred interest of
politicized identity in achieving emancipatory political recognition in
a posthumanist discourse, what are the logics of pain in subject
formation within late modernity that might contain or subvert this aim?
What are the particular constituents-specific to our time, yet roughly
generic for a diverse spectrum of identities-of [identity\'s desire for
recognition that seem as often to breed a politics of recrimination and
rancor, of culturally dispersed paralysis and suffering, a tendency to
reproach power rather than aspire to it, to disdain freedom rather than
practice it]{.underline}? In short, where do elements of politicized
identity\'s investments in itself and especially in its own history of
suffering come into conflict with the need to give up these investments
in the pursuit of an emancipatory democratic project? I approach these
questions by sketching, first, the discursive context of identity
politics\' emergence in the United States, and then elaborating, through
reconsideration of Nietzsche\'s genealogy of the logics of ressentiment,
the wounded character of politicized identity\'s desire within this
context. What this essay is not is a partisan position in the argument
about the virtues and vices of a contemporary political formation called
\"identity politics,\" an argument sufficiently stalemated to suggest
the limitations of discussing identity either in terms of the
(implicitly timeless) metaphysical or linguistic elements of its
constitution or in the moral terms of good and evil. It is, rather, an
exploration of the ways in which certain troubling aspects of the
specific genealogy of politicized identity are carried in its political
demands, ways in which certain emancipatory aims of politicized identity
are subverted not only by the constraints of the political discourses in
which its operations transpire but by its own wounded attachments.

#### **Identity politics reentrenches capitalism because it puts the fault of state violence and stagnated upward mobility on race, sexuality, or gender rather than class relations which underpin capitalism. This crowds critique of capitalism ensuring continued state violence and inequality.**

**Brown 93** \[Wendy, Prof. Pol Sci @ Berkeley, "Wounded Attachments,"
*Political Theory*, Vol. 21 No. 3 (Aug), p. 393-5\]

In addition to the formations of identity that may be the complex
effects of disciplinary and liberal modalities of power, I want to
suggest one other historical strand relevant to the production of
politicized identity, this one hewn more specifically to recent
developments in political culture. Although sanguine to varying degrees
about the phenomenon they are describing, many on the European and North
American Left have argued that identity politics emerges from the demise
of class politics consequent to post-Fordism or pursuant to May 1968.
Without adjudicating the precise relationship between the breakup of
class politics and the proliferation of other sites of political
identification, I want to refigure this claim by suggesting that what we
have come to call [identity politics is partly dependent on the demise
of a critique of capitalism]{.underline} [and of bourgeois cultural and
economic values.]{.underline} In a reading that links the new identity
claims to a certain relegitimation of capitalism, [identity politics
concerned with race, sexuality, and gender will appear not as a
supplement to class politics]{.underline}, not as an expansion of Left
categories of oppression and emancipation, not as an enriching
complexification of progressive formulations of power and persons-all of
which they also are-[but as tethered to a formulation of justice which,
ironically, reinscribes a bourgeois ideal as its measure.]{.underline}
If it is [this ideal]{.underline} that [signifies]{.underline}
educational and vocational [opportunity]{.underline}, [upward mobility,
relative protection against arbitrary violence]{.underline}, and reward
in proportion to effort, and [if it is this ideal against
which]{.underline} many of the [exclusions]{.underline} and privations
[of people of color, gays and lesbians, and women are articulated, then
the political purchase of]{.underline} contemporary American [identity
politics would seem to be achieved in part through a]{.underline}
certain [discursive renaturalization of capitalism]{.underline} that can
be said to have marked progressive discourse since the 1970s. What this
suggests is that [identity politics may be partly configured
by]{.underline} a peculiarly shaped and peculiarly disguised form of
[resentment]{.underline}-class resentment without class consciousness or
class analysis. [This resentment is displaced onto discourses of
injustice]{.underline} other than class [but]{.underline}, like all
resentments, [retains]{.underline} the real or imagined holdings of its
reviled subject-in this case, [bourgeois male
privileges]{.underline}-[as objects of desire.]{.underline} From this
perspective, it would appear that the articulation of politicized
identities through race, gender, and sexuality require, rather than
incidentally produce, a relatively limited identification through class.
[They necessarily]{.underline} rather than incidentally [abjure a
critique of class power and class norms precisely because the injuries
suffered by these identities are measured by bourgeois norms of social
acceptance, legal protection, relative material comfort, and social
independence.]{.underline} The problem is that [when]{.underline} not
only economic stratification but other [injuries]{.underline} to body
and psyche enacted by capitalism (alienation, commodification,
exploitation, displacement, disintegration of sustaining, albeit
contradictory, social forms such as families and neighborhoods) [are
discursively normalized and thus depoliticized,]{.underline} other
[markers of social difference]{.underline} may come to [bear an
inordinate weight. Absent an articulation of capitalism]{.underline} in
the political discourse of identity, the marked [identity bears all the
weight]{.underline} of the sufferings produced by capitalism in addition
to that bound to the explicitly politicized marking.

Thanks, Jesse, for these observations. I think your point about how we
find solidarities is a key point, including how we find the [secret
solidarities already in effect, where our entanglement is already
felt.]{.underline}  Immersion programs like the one you cite at
Vanderbilt are essentially the educational equivalent of
water-boarding. They [take students and plunge them into isolation to
ensure no solidarity develops amongst them. To individuate them and
convince them they are on their own.]{.underline} In a similar way we
could understand student internships largely as the educational
equivalent of putting those big earphones and blinders on Guantanamo
prisoners. [Anything to cut you off from everybody else, to immerse you
in the isolation of the market, and especially to disrupt all the
ongoing conspiracies without a plot]{.underline}, as Valentina Desideri
and I put it. I am not trying to collapse the distinction here between
torture and education, much less trivialize the crimes of torture. But
internships [and immersion programs as they are presently constituted
are weapons in the domestic, economic war on us, and especially the war
on]{.underline} our [students]{.underline}. [Universities 'reform'
themselves with more and more of these programs designed to use the
market to search and destroy]{.underline} what I called earlier [any
perversions amongst the student body that do not conform to
individuation, sovereignty, self-sufficiency.]{.underline} This
[delusion of such individual sovereignty must be imposed]{.underline},
through things like internships and immersion programs, where it is not
taken up 'freely.' These university programs are counter-intelligence
programs aimed at study.Because given a little time and space, some kind
of campus or bar or back staircase, students are likely to get together,
for the sake of it, but also because it is absolutely necessary to
survival. You need accomplices to survive. The authorities know
this. They [individuate us to put us at risk]{.underline}. That is why
they want [to intern students in the market as much as
possible]{.underline} --- because our market today is virtually without
solidarities. The reason I keep thinking about a partial education is
that it admits that we can't make it on our own. [We're parts. We're
incomplete. Solidarity should be understood this way. It is not a matter
of choice. It is not whether we choose to be in solidarity or alliance
or whatever with each other. We have to be]{.underline}. And [when we
are immersed and interned, we don't make it.]{.underline} Indeed
[solidarity]{.underline} is maybe the wrong word, or perhaps the word
[needs a new meaning.]{.underline} Maybe [solidarity is]{.underline}
where we are always interdicted from starting, in [our inseparable
difference.]{.underline} Maybe [it is where we remain, despite all their
efforts]{.underline}. Maybe [solidarity is the condition of
life.]{.underline} And [a lack of solidarity must go under the name of
death, the brutal individuation]{.underline} as Fred and I have said of
murder for instance, or the murderous illusions of the subject, the
settler, the entrepreneur. Maybe solidarity is not the right word in any
case. Maybe as Hortense Spillers says the word is empathy. Or maybe it
should be a phrase --- [the preservation of the ontological
totality]{.underline} as Cedric Robinson teaches us.In any case as you
say, Jesse, [the university and the market are the true 'allies.'
Because they can make up strategic plans, rules about being allies, and
*choose* to be allies.]{.underline} It is their true 'allyship' that
forces us to be dependent on them for survival because it is true: we
cannot survive on our own. Of course, we could survive in a conspiracy
without a plot, amongst unseen accomplices, but this is precisely what
[university education is designed to disrupt, even though this
conspiracy is often invisible to them]{.underline}. That's [disruptive
innovation, as they say, destroying our necessary and yet always
under-formed, vulnerable solidarities]{.underline}. Because when we say
conspiracy without a plot we are [trying to point to this perpetually
not fully formed, incomplete love and pain of our]{.underline}
undercommon [flesh]{.underline}. [We need each other, but not to be
whole, not to reconstitute our version of a total education, but to stay
partial, and when necessary to help each other get partial
again]{.underline}.So as you rightly point out, Jesse, the university
counters these conspiracies, our thing, with the promise of giving
students 'their thing' --- their USP, unique selling point --- which is
really not a selling point, but a price point --- how cheap and
accessible can we make you for what you can give an employer?  They make
a value proposition of our students. You are exactly right that the
university tells the students, as it tells its academics[, that our
thing is just your thing, your individual thing.]{.underline} And as we
have said it does not just tell us, but shows us by how it structures
the total education of both academics and students.

### 1NC - Link---Monolithic Blackness

#### Black as an identity marker presents a monolithic version of the black identity based off of definitive definitions. The publicizing of the monolith allows for niggas to be seen only in their stereotype, rather than as nuanced entities. Embodying blackness allows for a proliferation of the different sectors of the identity even in contradiction.

**Snyder 12** \[Multivalent Recognition: Between Fixity and Fluidity in
Identity Politics, Greta Fowler Snyder, University of Virginia, The
Journal of Politics, Vol. 74, No. 1 (Jan., 2012), pp. 249-261//IRT\]

Alexander opens with the following concern: [Visions of black
identity---both self-representations and representations of black
identity in the mainstream--- have become ''calciﬁed'']{.underline}
(2004, ix). Drawing the connections between calciﬁcation, [oppression of
the group and repression of the individual]{.underline}, Alexander
argues that cultivating and accessing that metaphysical space---''the
black interior''---from which [complex and nuanced visions of black
identity spring is of the utmost importance]{.underline}. While [the
black interior harbors racialized visions of identity]{.underline}---the
interior of which Alexander speaks is speciﬁcally black---she insists
that [a social identity like black ''need not be seen as a
constraint'']{.underline} (2004, 5). In the black interior, black
artists have found [black ''selves that go far, far beyond the limited
expectations and deﬁnitions of what black is, isn't or should
be'']{.underline}. Only [such black selves can combat not just
devaluation, but calciﬁcation.]{.underline} Integral to achieving a more
capacious notion of [black identity is the proliferation of different
identities signiﬁed as black. Monolithic versions of blackness
frequently contradict one another]{.underline} (Alexander 2004, 6); this
was certainly true of blackness as represented by the Panthers and US.
These groups did not allow the different visions to peacefully coexist,
but Alexander advocates for a world in which [different conceptions of
blackness are]{.underline} en[able]{.underline}d [to coexist
side-by-side in contradiction]{.underline}. In this world, people insist
[on the importance of ''black'' as a social identity while embracing the
multiplicity of blackness.]{.underline} As the [visions of black
identity enabled to sit side-by-side proliferate]{.underline}, Alexander
envisions [''being black'' going so far as ''to be emptied of meaning
and reclaimed as possibility]{.underline}'' (2004, 8). An abundance of
contradicting meanings renders [blackness more malleable. In the absence
of a determinate deﬁnition of real blackness, black people are freed of
expectations about what black is, isn't, and should be, and empowered to
realize selves that go ''beyond stereotype and romance'']{.underline}
(203). While interested in proliferating black identities, Alexander
recognizes that ''regardless of the artist's intent, he or she is
[painting against a history of deformation and annihilation of the black
body]{.underline}'' (7). Given this history, she admits that
[publicizing certain visions of black identity could be
harmful]{.underline}. Alexander writes, "I do not consider it a betrayal
of my muse to say there are a few poems that I might write but not read
or publish in certain forums because I felt---imagined? They would cause
harm to that amorphous group called black people, poems that might
perpetuate dangerous stereotypes if taken drastically out of context\...
These considerations\...indicate that there are\...degrees of
self-censorship that we are faced with because of our history, and that
our public acts are sometimes appropriately strategic?" (2004, 57--58)
While not going as far as to advocate'' that old sawhorse of positive
imagery'' (Alexander 2004, 8), Alexander is concerned with [presenting
blackness in ways that undermine or complicate those representations
historically and presently used to marginalize black
people.]{.underline} Given a history of deformation, she acknowledges
that [public representations of black people must be strategic if black
people and culture are to be understood as complex and nuanced
entities]{.underline}. Due to the calciﬁcation of black identity,
[offering new and challenging representations of black identity requires
creativity.]{.underline} But in a discussion of anthologies of black art
she is careful to note that [this diversity is already]{.underline}
t[here]{.underline}: ''a careful look at the texts and testimonies of
\[any\] time reveals various black powers more richly nuanced and
textured than glib summaries represent'' (2004, 88). In part, [seamless
narratives about black identity have been constructed by glossing over
black individuals who do not ﬁt expectations about what black is, isn't,
and should be.]{.underline} Allowing this diversity to disrupt these
conceptions is required to loosen the binds of both mainstream and group
constructions of ''the real.''

### 1NC - Link---Perversion

#### Subjectivity within the commons constitutes itself through the taming itself of perverse existence. \<Insert perverse relationship\> is labelled and understood as perverse by the commons as a result of the failure to prescribe to normative and existing orientation which produces our relationality to each other. The 1AC's rejection of this perversion in an act of embracing individuation is thus a denial of the search for lines of flight through an active acceptance and exploration of perverse relationality. 

**Moten and Harney 17** (Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, A Total
Education, How Institutions Think: Between Contemporary Art and
Curatorial Discourse)//e-toth

Is it not the case that we are faced today with a total education? The
term comes from Michel Foucault\'s classic passages on the modern prison
regime. Recall that Foucault used the term to speak about the
instruction of prisoners in every aspect of daily life and routine.
Foucault writes: \"[It must be the most powerful machinery for imposing
a new form on the perverted individual; its mode of action is the
constraint of a total education]{.underline}.\" . He outlines this
instruction deployed against perversion: In prison [the government may
dispose of the liberty of the person and the time of the prisoner; from
then on, one can imagine the power of the education which, not only in a
day, but in the succession of days and even years, may regulate for man
the time of waking and sleeping, of activity and rest, the number and
duration of meals, the quality and ration of food, the nature and
product of labor, the time of prayer, the use of speech and even, so to
speak, that of thought\...(2)]{.underline} Now, Foucault stressed that
because [this instruction represented the reform of \'perverted\'
bodies---bodies that previously had no such discipline---any call for
reforming the modern prison was a call for more
instruction]{.underline}. Reform produced more instruction. Instruction
produced more constraint, or discipline. **[Discipline only confirmed
the underlying perversion of these bodies, and called forth more reform,
which called forth more instruction to reform the perversion discipline
confirmed]{.underline}**. This process is reflected in Foucault\'s use
of the oxymoron \'perverted individual,\' an oxymoron that is
nonetheless the source of total education. Perversion violates the
principle of the individual by failing to accede to its proper
boundaries and comportments, and thus the perverted individual is an
ongoing violation that calls total education into being. In Foucault\'s
account, perversion appears as a turning aside (from the truth) that is,
somehow, prior, already existing. A prior turn. An already given turning
that requires straightening, that summons reform. Instruction is how we
get straightened out insofar as it is how one is straightened out.
[**Correction begins with the ascription of the body itself, the
imposition of body onto flesh;** the attribution of perversion to the
specific body, which justifies its correction, follows from its
isolation, and manifests itself as the theft of the body that has been
imposed by those who assert a right to instruct insofar as theirs are
bodies that they have supposedly both claimed and
transcended]{.underline}. [The ascription of body, the imposition of
bounded and enclosed self-possession, of a discrete self subject to
ownership, of ownership activated and confirmed either in theft or
trade, might be said to be the first reform, the first improvement,
insofar as it is the condition of possibility of reform, or improvement.
The assignment of body to flesh is the first stripe of the long, hard,
torturously straight, tortuously straightened row]{.underline}.
Instruction is the setting in order, the straightening out.
**[Instruction thereby reveals the essential relationship between
improvement and impoverishment, between the private and privation at the
heart of total education.]{.underline}** Perversion\'s wealth becomes
education\'s profit. Today there would appear to be few examples of
Foucault\'s total education in prison regimes. [**The program of reform,
the program of prisoner improvement, has been replaced almost everywhere
by one of punishment alone**, or what Foucault calls simply the
deprivation of liberty]{.underline}. At the same time, in pointing out
that the current prison program of \'slow-motion genocide\' has long
been the global norm in racialized regimes, abolitionist scholars refuse
to countenance reform of the exception, alerting us to the fact that
reform of the prison and reform of the prisoner are as much modalities
of genocide as the [interplay of privation and
privatization]{.underline} that racial incarceration relentlessly
innovates. \[3) But what if? What if perversion is placed under
constraint in the very idea of individuation, which projects
improvement\'s subject as improvement\'s object? Is a form of
imprisonment. Then [the figure of the perverted individual is always
already in the system. Conversely, if perversion\'s location in the
individual body is a form of imprisonment and instruction, then
perversion is already given anti-/ante-individuation.]{.underline} If
prison/school are two sides of a common institutional structure that
operates by way of individuation, [then perversion is a pre-carceral
breaking out of prison, a pre-scholarly dropping out of school, that
continually reveals the ubiquity of the total education that it hunts it
down and puts it to work. Insofar as it is the case that in prison,
every worker who is in or out of work---even the enemy combatant, the
prisoner, and the supposedly unemployable---is subject to a total
education.]{.underline} Indeed, the rampant speculation on improvement
made possible today by finance requires an all but universal diagnosis
of perversion, a diagnosis that requires instructional method and
institutional structure that are, at once, extremely narrow and
hierarchially subdivided. This suggestion may seem to run counter to our
common sense about today's price making market. This market appears to
create an atomized landscape that leaves each individual to his or her
own devices, free to choose and to act. [Indeed, we hear a lot a lot
about the states that are hollow, and institutions that are
dysfunctional. In such a landscape, the idea of a total education
requiring a total institution to set it in motion and a totalizing
method to set in motion may seem misplaced. Certainly, the assertion
that such at total education effectively dominates this landscape
appears counterintuitive. We are withdrawn from the state so that the
object, in its separation, can be enjoyed. But withdrawal is not truly
abandonment; what is at stake, rather, in this withdrawal is a
subdivision of enjoyment. What emerges is a kind of homo-socialization
(or politicization) of enjoyment---a regulatory straightening and
monolithic consumption and de-(en)tangling of enjoyment, as if orgy were
constantly replaced by serial monogamy]{.underline}. What separation
does to enjoyment is crucial, and cruel. [**Withdrawal from the object
of enjoyment is an act of individuation that is imposed upon the that
object**. More precisely, self ownership is imposed on the object as a
dormant or etiolated capacity whose ineffectiveness requires that it be
submitted to a regime in which it is absolutely subject to being enjoyed
by another. Consider for example, the imposition upon the enslaved of
bodies retroactively and simultaneously declared to be both their own
and improperly and ineffectively self-possessed and the concomitant
theft of those bodies by the one, The Man, who enslaves. This is the
difference between two modes of enjoyment---enjoyment in separation and
enjoyment in entanglement---the enjoyment (the use) of (the separable)
body and the enjoyment of (entangled or undercommon) flesh. It is for
this very reason that instruction is necessary. Instruction is the
regulation (for purposes of employment and individual enjoyment) of
anoriginal perversion.]{.underline} And because these failures---the
constant threat of total system failure as the anoriginal
perversion---run across all areas of the social reproduction of life,
instruction must also cover all areas. It must everywhere convert
failure from a perversion to a point on a line. It must everywhere
reduce failure to a bell curve. It must be everywhere. It must be a
total education.

#### Black women's equation with the flesh and becoming of flesh within the biological confines of slavery make black women's flesh into an object of desire and sensuality which reinscribes the state of capture from within the hold. The temporality of the captive body is converted into a conglomeration of sexuality, violence and objectification and potential for pornotroping foreclosing black women's potential for agency or subversive action

**Note: I think this needs to be really heavily highlighted if you want
to go for this/make the debate productive when reading this card. This
also works as an impact card**

This link between black femininity and historicity provides us with one
frame for reading Walker's tableau. From this perspective, the tableau
illustrates [the perpetual and enduring wound of slavery]{.underline}.
Following Carol E. Henderson, [I use the trope of the wound to invoke
the way this traumatic history manifests itself in visible corporeal
form.]{.underline}14 In keeping with this reading, we might argue that
[Walker illuminates both the woundedness of black women by figuring the
atrocities of slavery and the flattening effect of this woundedness
through her use of silhouette.]{.underline} These processes are
described at length in Hortense Spillers's essay, "Mama's Baby, Papa's
Maybe: An American Grammar Book." Here, Spillers traces how [black women
become flesh through the Atlantic slave trade.]{.underline} [While all
black bodies become flesh through the process of enslavement---"Under
these conditions, we lose at least gender difference in the outcome, and
the female body and the male body become a territory of cultural and
political maneuver, not at all gender-related, gender specific"---there
is still a particularly gendered dimension to the
experience]{.underline}.15 This happens because [sexuality is the frame
for interacting with racialized flesh, the broad contours of which
Spillers outlines: "1) The captive body becomes the source of an
irresistible, destructive sensuality; 2) at the same time---in stunning
contradiction---the captive body reduces to a thing, becoming being for
the captor; 3) in this absence from a subject position, the captured
sexualities provide a physical and biological expression of 'otherness';
4) As a category of 'otherness,' the captive body translates into a
potential for pornotroping and embodies sheer physical powerlessness
that slides into a more general 'powerlessness,' resonating through
various centers of human and social meaning."]{.underline}16 What we see
in [Spillers's articulation of how gender and sexuality shape the modes
of fleshiness is the explicit link between violence, sexuality, and
powerlessness. While these factors also clearly work in the production
of black masculine flesh, Spillers is more concerned with articulating
how this wounds black women.]{.underline}17 Here, Spillers focuses on
the reordering of kinship through the separation of mothers from
children and the inability for a woman to elect whether to reproduce and
with whom. This denial of motherhood and removal of the paternal
function produces a web of contradictions that, Spillers argues, are
unique to the black female subject and render her flesh in a particular
way: "In this play of paradox, only the female stands in the flesh, both
mother and mother-dispossessed."18 Spillers is insistent that [the black
woman's equation with the flesh is distinct from other forms of
becoming-flesh. Indeed, it is clear that this form of objectification is
different from the becoming-flesh that Beauvoir discusses because the
terms of objectification do not veer into narcissism. It is also
different from the becoming-flesh that Fanon describes because this
formulation of becoming-flesh is linked to the particular historical
moment of slavery rather than the sticky temporality of animality and
becoming-biological. Nor is this mode of the flesh equivalent to the
pain produced by illness or the dominating gaze of patriarchy or
colonialism.]{.underline} While it shares some things with these forms
of embodiment, this [fleshiness is marked by a particular conglomeration
of sexuality, violence, and objectification. This is flesh that has been
caught in the perpetual wound of slavery, so that agency cannot even be
illusory: it has already been foreclosed]{.underline}. Through this
emphasis on objectification, we begin to see the particular processes of
flattening at work. In addition to reading this flattening 160
Conclusion into flesh as a mode of inhabiting historicity[, the politics
of slavery enable us to read this flattening as part of a circuit that
uses black women's bodies and absents their sexuality. Spillers, here,
is adamant that the flesh that black women inhabit is one that does not
allow her access to her own sexuality but renders her available for the
use of others.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Link -- Identity Possession

#### Liberal individualism is premised on limits -- the bodily limits, limits of property, or experiential limits that one may not go beyond. The aff's investment in the limitation of experience and the individuation of the liberal subject is a reaffirmation of whiteness, turning the aff.

As the fences in my gentrifying, whiten- ing neighborhood grow higher
and higher, the political, economic, and per- sonal functions of limits
in cultures of phallicized whiteness become more and more clear.
**[Limits constitute property and propriety. Demarcating a 'body' or
'subject' from the vagueness of backgrounds, conditions, cultures, or
histories, they serve as the site of individuation.]{.underline}**
**[They circumvent an entity, orienting us toward the criterion of
'wholeness,' a primary demand of legibility in cultures of phallicized
whiteness.]{.underline}** Not unlike the rit- uals of urination contests
among male dogs, limits mark out our territories. **[They ground our
deep senses of ourselves as individuals, our narratives of ahistorical
autonomous self-determination, and the many cultural forms of that self-
determination.]{.underline}** In a slightly different mode, limits also
function as internal and external constraints of possibility that frame
personal, social, or even economic fields. We understand ourselves, for
example, as limited internally by our social and cultural backgrounds or
as constrained by our financial resources. Or, exter- nally, limits also
function as thresholds that stand at the outer limit of ex- periences
and cannot be trespassed, exercising an external authoritative re-
straint that expresses itself as a prohibition. For example, nations
(most nations, at least) are restrained and limited by international
law; or, more locally, I may simply realize that, with age encroaching,
my limit is three drinks. In all of these, **[limits function as that
which one (a social attitude, a political entity, a person) cannot or
must not go beyond.]{.underline}** **[They indicate thresholds of
experience, forming the contours of our desire and subjectivity, whether
internally or externally imposed. When framed as prohibitions, they
incite our desire: death and drugs, along with sex and love, are the
most commonly explored 'limit experiences.']{.underline}** Across all of
these functions, a common operation is at work. **[From the function of
limits as internal conditions of possibility or external boundaries of
restraint to the demarcations of wholeness and individuation, limits
constitute legibility.]{.underline}** One belongs to one's cultural
background, gaining identity and di- rection from its historical
particularity; nations that disobey international law are "imperialist"
or "rogue states," depending on their economic might; I am a hung-over
sop, not an interesting person, the morning after an evening of more
than three drinks; and, fundamentally to all of these, **[a true
individual is he or she who can clearly stake his or her own
identity---psychologically, politically, economically---in the chaotic
world.]{.underline}** It is this last phenomenon, the demarcating of the
individual and all its permutations, that I want to explore and develop,
rooting it particularly in the modern political projects of classical
liberalism and their attendant concepts of freedom. **[The logic of the
limit thus expresses itself in two fundamental registers: as enclosure
and as prohibition.]{.underline}** These two registers are dialectically
related. **[The demarcating of entities (persons, experiences, ideas,
institutions) clearly and distinctly from other entities and from
historico-cultural backgrounds enacts a mode of separation that leads us
to frame desire as the careful negotiation---and prohibition---of
boundaries.]{.underline}** For example, **[we introduce ownership on the
model of private property into the social field when we conceive of an
entity as individuated on the basis of its enclosure and containment by
clear boundaries.]{.underline}** **[This model of ownership, grounded in
a fun- damental preference for labor that enacts a futural temporality,
in turn ini- tiates an economics of scarcity into the field of social
relations.]{.underline}** **[We demand that we must demarcate that which
is properly "ours." Private property comes to dominate our senses of the
world---of our selves, others, objects, and all possible relations
therein. Each becomes a quantifiable unit. As the social field is
reduced to modes of ownership, scarcity comes to dominate the kinds of
relations that obtain therein. The fear of encroachment begins to
override any desire to cross these clear and distinct
boundaries.]{.underline}** And the crossing of boundaries, whether
between persons, classes, sexes, races, nations, or relig- ions, becomes
prohibited. **[Boundaries differentiate us; individuation becomes our
most precious value; and the crossing of boundaries is forbidden,
creating that tantalizing social realm of fetish and
taboo.]{.underline}** The two registers of the logic of the limit,
enclosure and prohibition, are thereby analytically distinct, but
functionally intertwined. The resilience of phallicized whiteness and
its domination of the social field in cultures of late modernity depend
on these subtle, often unnoticed if not invisible, dy- namics. **[Both
enclosure and prohibition collude to ground the fundamental values of
freedom and individualism, all bound by the model of private property
and the fundamental value of labor that enacts a futural temporality, in
cultures of phallicized whiteness.]{.underline}**

#### 

#### The liberal individual is conceptualized as untouched by historical, temporal, spatial, political categories -- the aff's method suggests that recourse to the liberal individual solves the aff when in fact it reinstates the very impacts they militate against, resulting in the intensification of whiteness and turning the aff.

Locke's normative model for the liberal individual thereby becomes he
who is bound by his ability to labor within a concept of the future
sufficient to stake out a piece of land as property. While Cynthia
Willett gives Locke credit for trying to articulate a middle-class
resistance to "the leisure class and its idle games," she nonetheless
argues that Locke remains entrapped by a conception of rationality "in
terms of the English middle-class appreciation for the market value of
productive labor and property" (2001, 71). Not only are his concepts of
rationality shaped by these historical preferences, but his concepts of
man's condition---man's desire, destiny, labor, and individuality--- all
carry these historical preferences into universalized discourses that
con- tinue to serve as the bedrock of many of our cultural assumptions
and prac- tices. Although **[Locke's politics]{.underline}** were
moderately progressive for the late seventeenth century, the lasting
damage of these concepts **[still haunts our political quandaries and
the very frameworks through which we continue to seek redress. The logic
of limit as enclosure, as the ways that the state of society becomes
demarcated from---and always preferred over, even while
romanticizing---the state of nature, continuously rewrites itself in
several registers across the political histories of the U.S. It
fundamentally grounds our understanding of the individual as the person
who is clearly demarcated from nature.]{.underline}** The individual
becomes that 'civilized' man who takes his natural origin, as an
enclosed body that is a product of God's labor, and produces private
property that is enclosed into durable forms which persist into and even
control the future. From this critical enclosure of the world and the
self, written in the register of property, other modern epistemologies
and political projects easily attach themselves to this clear and
distinct unit, the individual. (Adam Smith, for example, quickly comes
to mind.) **[The individual, carved out of nature through productive
labor and conceiving the world and himself on the model of appropriating
private property, emerges as the cornerstone of political theories and
practices in cultures of phallicized whiteness.]{.underline}** The
individual thereby comes to function as an ahistorical unit defined by
its productive labor's distancing relation to the state of nature, not
by any historico-political forces. (With his unhistorical thinking,
Locke acts per- fectly as a liberal individual.) **[Classical liberalism
writes the individual as the (allegedly) neutral substratum of all
political decisions, positioning it as separable from
historico-political forces.]{.underline}** **[In carving the individual
out of both the natural and socio-historico-political landscapes, modern
political and epistemological projects turn around Locke's fundamental
metaphors of enclosure.]{.underline}** **[The individual, that seat of
political and personal subjectivity, is *enclosed* and thus cut off from
all other forces circulating in the social environment.]{.underline}**
**[The individual effectively functions as a piece of private property,
with the strange twist of owning itself, impervious to all intruders and
protected by the inherent right of ownership, derived from the
ontological right to one's own enclosed body.]{.underline}** History
then is reduced to a collection of what Kelly Oliver has aptly called
"discrete facts that can be known or not known, written in history
books, and \[that\] are discontinuous with the present" (2001, 130).
History is that collection of events that occurred in the past and is
now tightly sealed in that past. History is simply what has happened,
with no fundamental effect or influence upon what is happening now or
might happen in the future. **[Historicity is unthought and unthinkable
here. The modern rational self---the liberal individual---exists in a
temporally and historically sealed vacuum, made possible by the clear
disjunction between past, present, and future.]{.underline}**
**[Cartesian concepts of time as discrete moments that do not enter into
contact or affect one another dominate this conception of the
individual.]{.underline}**10 The logic of the limit thereby demarcates
the past sharply and neatly from the present, turning each into objects
about which we can develop concepts, facts, and truths. The future, that
temporal horizon initiated by preferred forms of complex labor, becomes
the sole focus of intention and desire. But the future never arrives.
Therefore, if historicity and 'the historical' mean reading present
ideas, values, or concepts as undergoing a constant shaping and
reshaping by material forces, **[this divorce of the past from the
present effectively renders all temporal zones---past, present, future,
and all permutations---ahistorical. Existence itself is radically
dehistoricized. And the individual, that bastion of political activity
and value, accordingly resides in a historical vacuum, untouched by
historical forces---the very realm of whiteness.]{.underline}** This
ahistorical view of history perpetuates the modern project of clas-
sical liberalism and its damages, creating a particular kind of
individual. The individual becomes the locus of identity, selfhood, and
subjectivity in the modern political project. Demarcated from historical
existence, it also re- quires careful delineation from other bodies,
whether persons, institutions, history, or social attitudes. **[This
concept of the individual develops with a pronounced insistence on its
neutrality, rendering specific attributes of the individual merely
particular qualities that function, again, on the model of private
property: characteristics such as race, gender, religion, or nationality
remain at a distance from this insistently neutral
individual.]{.underline}** (I use the pro- noun "it" to emphasize the
function of this alleged neutrality, a dynamic that is central to the
valorization of the white propertied Christian male as the subject of
power in phallicized whiteness.) **[This insular existence, under-
scored by its ahistorical status, is further ensured by claims of
radical autonomy, whereby the individual is the source, site, and
endpoint of all actions, desires, thoughts, and behaviors: we choose
what we do.]{.underline}** And we choose it, of course, because we are
rational: Kantian ethics become the proper bookend to Locke's initiating
of "high modernity's"11 schemas. **[This demarcation of the individual
then carves the critical division between internal and external, and its
political-psychic counterpart, that between self and
Other.]{.underline}** The self is located squarely and exclusively in
one's rational faculties, the natural law that, according to Locke,
civilizes us into economies of labor, utility, and a strange mix of
scarcity and abundance. **[The modern rational self is radically
self-contained---enclosed. It is a sovereign self, unaffected by and
independent from any thing or force external to it, whether materiality
or the Other.]{.underline}** **[Assuming it exercises rationality
appropriately, this self is radically autonomous, choosing its own place
in the world.]{.underline}** (Pointing to America, Locke insists that
civilized men are free to leave society.) It does not heed any call of
the Other. It is effectively autog- enous, existing in a pre-Hegelian
philosophical world.12 Utility and its epistemological counterpart,
instrumentality, subsequently become the operative conceptions of power
in this schema of the liberal individual as the self. Autonomous,
autogenous, and ahistorical, the modern rational individual is in full
control of its self. **[Its power is thereby something that it owns and
wields, as it chooses.]{.underline}** Power is not some force that might
shape the individual without its assent or, at a minimum, its
acknowledg- ment. It is something that an individual, even if in the
form of an individual state, wields intentionally. **[It can still use
this power legitimately or illegitimately, but that is a matter of
choice. The individual controls power and the ways that it affects the
world: this is its expression of freedom.]{.underline}** Accordingly,
the role of the law becomes to vigilantly protect this ahistorical unit,
the individual, from the discriminations and violences of historical
vicissitudes. **[The role of the law is to protect the individual's
power, the seat of its freedom.]{.underline}** We are far from
Foucaultian ideas that perhaps power and history constitute the ways we
view and experience the world, shaping our categories and embedding us
in this very notion of the individual as autonomous, au- togenous, and
ahistorical. **[The liberal individual, untouched by material, po-
litical, and historical conditions, is a neutral substratum that freely
wields its power as it chooses: this is the liberal sovereignty and
mastery of freedom.]{.underline}** **[Because the individual is this
neutral substratum, differences may or may not attach themselves to it.
But those differences are cast into that inconsequential space of
material conditions along with history and the Other.]{.underline}** The
odd twist of self-ownership surfaces more fully here. Following Locke's
metaphors of enclosure, **[the individual is enclosed and sealed off not
only from all historical and social forces in the environment, but also
from the very attributes of difference within itself.]{.underline}**
While specific attributes that con- stitute "difference" in North
American culture continuously shift, with new categories emerging and
old ones receding, the particular vector of difference that matters
depends on our historical location, and all its complexities.13
**[Consequently, these attributes do not fundamentally affect the
neutrality of the modern individual. These differences occur at the
level of the body and history, realms of existence that do not touch the
self-contained individual.]{.underline}** **[The neutral individual
relates to these differences through the models of enclosure and
ownership.]{.underline}** **[It experiences these discrete parts of
itself (e.g., race, gender, religion, nationality) as one owns a variety
of objects in economies of (scarce) private property: one chooses when
one wishes to purchase, own, display, or wear such objects as one freely
desires.]{.underline}** The unnerving in- fluence of power surfaces,
however, as we realize that **[this free choice becomes the exclusive
power of the subject position valorized in cultures of phallicized
whiteness]{.underline}**, **[the white propertied Christian (straight)
male]{.underline}**14 **[who determines when, how, and which differences
matter.]{.underline}**

#### Liberal individualism dominates our political imaginations, foreclosing the possibilities of an otherwise -- this circulates the aff politics back into liberal colorblindness, erasing that colorblindness is always about whiteness and therefore reinstantiating its power through normalizing and invisiblizing it as a desirable political horizon.

**Winnubst 6** \[Shannon Winnubst is a Chair and Professor of Women's,
Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Ohio State University. "Queering
Freedom," *Indiana University Press*, Bloomington, 2006, p 51-52 //tjb\]

The concept of the individual should function as a bulwark against the
inappropriate uses of these various categories of difference, which are
at- tached to it in (merely) historical ways. **[The judgment of how the
individual is functioning as an individual---i.e., as a neutral
individual untainted by differences such as race, religion, sex, or
national origin---should serve as the baseline against which to
determine whether discrimination or preference is being
enacted.]{.underline}** **[The terms of the laws, policies, and heated
social debates were set: the function of the law is to protect the
neutral individual from political, historical, and material conditions
that might infringe upon its in- herent right to express itself, its
power, its freedom.]{.underline}** The constituent concepts of classical
liberalism find their full-blown expression here. And by the time Reagan
is elected in 1979 with his promises to halt affirmative action, his
language comes as little surprise: "We must not allow the noble concept
of equal opportunity to be distorted into federal guidelines or quotas
which require race, ethnicity, or sex---rather than ability and
qualifications---to be the principal factor in hiring or education"
(Mills 1994, 17). The neutral individual and its native abilities and
qualifications must be protected. **[The model of ownership regarding
difference thereby dominates our political imaginations.]{.underline}**
While the specificities of the various categories and their historical
emergences and recessions is worth noting (e.g., sex is a late addition;
race and color, as well as religion and creed, are separated; ethnic
origin seems to replace national origin; most of all, class is never
mentioned, despite its originary role in both Locke's thinking and the
1935 National Labor Relations Act), the dominant category at work in
this system is the same category that grounds classical liberalism and
phallicized whiteness: the neutral individual stands as the alpha and
omega of all deliberations. **[All other differences, whether of
religion, race, sex, or some other attribute, are reduced to hindrances
of the individual's right to cultivate its native talents. The law must
protect and ensure equal opportunity, another focal category of
affirmative action debates, so that each individual---as an
individual---will have this right to develop. And this will only occur
if the neutrality that is necessary to the balance of equality is
obtained and ensured.]{.underline}** This understanding of the law as
the vehicle to ensure and protect the neutrality of the individual seems
to function on all sides (well, both sides, in the binary U.S.) of the
political spectrum. Whether one supports or crit- icizes affirmative
action, the endpoint is never questioned---namely, the cre- ation of a
society that views individuals as individuals. **[No one questions the
desirability, much less the ontological possibility, of a color-blind or
gender- blind society]{.underline}** (or a religion-blind or national
origin--blind one, although these are almost unthinkable and
increasingly unspeakable in 2003).29 But perhaps this is because the
rhetoric of blindness and the desirability of neutrality is endemic to
cultures of phallicized whiteness, circulating as an unspoken as-
sumption about human nature and the state of society, and functioning as
a critical tool of power to ensure the dominance of phallicized
whiteness's subject position. **[Phallicized whiteness functions through
erasing itself. Its power derives from its invisibility. And this power
grants it the right to determine which, when, and how differences
matter. Neutrality is one of phallicized whiteness's most effective
tools.]{.underline}**

## 1NC - Impacts

### 1NC - Impact---Ressentiment

#### Identity politics are parasitically attached to the very oppression that they try to overcome. Formulating politics in terms of identity and suffering turns their argument because identity itself is ontologically and psychologically dependent on suffering and evil. Politics becomes revenge against the agents of suffering rather than creating political spaces in which suffering can be overcome.

#### Despite all aspirations to radicality, identity politics remains mired in a thoroughly liberal, modernist conception of the subject: that the essence of one is basically free and historical accident sometimes intrudes upon that freedom, that the Good derives from actualizing this freedom, that this freedom is an exercise of our essential natures rather than politically contingent accidents of power.

**Brown 1995** \[Wendy, Professor of Political Science at Berkeley,
*States of Injury*, pp. 66-74\]

Liberalism contains from its inception a generalized incitement to what
Nietzsche terms ressentiment, the moralizing revenge of the powerless,
\"the triumph of the weak as weak. \"22 This incitement to ressentiment
inheres in two related constitutive paradoxes of liberalism: that
between individual liberty and social egalitarianism, a paradox which
produces failure turned to recrimination by the subordinated, and guilt
turned to resentment by the \"successful\"; and that between the
individualism that legitimates liberalism and the cultural homogeneity
required by its commitment to political universality, a paradox which
stimulates the articulation of politically significant differences on
the one hand, and the suppression of them on the other, and which offers
a form of articulation that presses against the limits of universalist
discourse even while that which is being articulated seeks to be
harbored within-included in-the terms of that universalism. Premising
itself on the natural equality of human beings, liberalism makes a
political promise of universal individual freedom in order to arrive at
social equality, or achieve a civilized retrieval of the equality
postulated in the state of nature. It is the tension between the
promises of individualistic liberty and the requisites of equality that
yields ressentiment in one of two directions, depending on the way in
which the paradox is brokered. A strong commitment to freedom vitiates
the fulfillment of the equality promise and breeds ressentiment as
welfare state liberalism\--attenuations of the unmitigated license of
the rich and powerful on behalf of the \"disadvantaged.\" Conversely, a
strong commitment to equality, requiring heavy state interventionism and
economic redistribution, attenuates the commitment to freedom and breeds
ressentiment expressed as neoconservative anti-statism, racism, charges
of reverse racism, and so forth. However, [it is not only the tension
between freedom and equality but the prior presumption of the
self-reliant and self-made capacities of liberal subjects, conjoined
with their unavowed dependence on and construction by a variety of
social relations and forces, that makes all liberal subjects, and not
only markedly disenfranchised ones, vulnerable to ressentiment: it is
their situatedness within power, their production by power, and liberal
discourse\'s denial of this situatedness and production that cast the
liberal subject into failure, the failure to make itself in the context
of a discourse in which its self-making is assumed, indeed, is its
assumed nature]{.underline}. [This failure, which Nietzsche calls
suffering, must either find a reason within itself (which redoubles the
failure) or a site of external blame upon which to avenge its hurt and
redistribute its pain. Here is Nietzsche\'s account of this moment in
the production of ressentiment: For every sufferer instinctively seeks a
cause for]{.underline} his [suffering]{.underline}, [more exactly, an
agent; still more specifically, a guilty agent who is susceptible to
suffering]{.underline}\--in short, some living thing upon which he can,
on some pretext or other, vent his affects, actually or in effigy \....
[This \... constitutes the actual physiological cause of ressentiment,
vengefulness, and the like: a desire to deaden pain by means of
affects\... to deaden, by means of a more violent emotion of any kind, a
tormenting, secret pain that is becoming unendurable, and to drive it
out of consciousness at least for the moment]{.underline}: for that one
requires an affect, as savage an affect as possible, and, in order to
excite that, any pretext at all.23 Ressentiment in this context is a
triple achievement: it produces an affect (rage, righteousness) that
overwhelms the hurt; it produces a culprit responsible for the hurt; and
it produces a site of revenge to displace the hurt (a place to inflict
hurt as the sufferer has been hurt). Together these operations both
ameliorate (in Nietzsche\'s term, \"anaesthetize\") and externalize what
is otherwise \"unendurable.\" In a culture already streaked with the
pathos of ressentiment for the reasons just discussed, there are several
distinctive characteristics of late modern postindustrial societies that
accelerate and expand the conditions of its production. My listing will
necessarily be highly schematic: First, the phenomenon William Connolly
names \"increased global contingency\" combines with the expanding
pervasiveness and complexity of domination by capital and bureaucratic
state and social networks to create an unparalleled individual
powerlessness over the fate and direction of one\'s own life,
intensifying the experiences of impotence, dependence, and gratitude
inherent in liberal capitalist orders and constitutive of
ressellfiment.24 Second, the steady desacralization of all regions of
life\--what Weber called disenchantment, what Nietzsche called the death
of god-would seem to add yet another reversal to Nietzsche\'s genealogy
of ressentiment as perpetually available to \"alternation of
direction.\" In Nietzsche\'s account, the ascetic priest deployed
notions of \"guilt, sin, sinfulness, depravity, damnation\" to \"direct
the ressentiment of the less severely afflicted sternly back upon
themselves \... and in this way exploited the bad instincts of all
sufferers for the purpose of self-discipline, self-surveillance, and
self-overcoming. \"25 However, the desacralizing tendencies of late
modernity undermine the efficacy of this deployment and turn
suffering\'s need for exculpation back toward a site of external
agency26 Third, the increased fragmentation, if not disintegration, of
all forms of association not organized until recently by the commodities
market-communities, churches, families-and the ubiquitousness of the
classificatory, individuating schemes of disciplinary society, combine
to produce an utterly unrelieved individual, one without insulation from
the inevitable failure entailed in liberalism\'s individualistic
construction. 27 ln short, [the characteristics of late modern secular
society, in which individuals are buffeted and controlled by global
configurations of disciplinary and capitalist power of extraordinary
proportions, and are at the same time nakedly individuated, stripped of
reprieve from relentless exposure and accountability for themselves,
together add up to an incitement to ressentiment that might have stunned
even the finest philosopher of its occasions and logics. Starkly
accountable yet dramatically impotent, the late modern liberal subject
quite literally seethes with ressentiment11]{.underline}. [Enter
politicized identity, now conceivable in part as both product of and
reaction to this condition, where \"reaction\" acquires the meaning
Nietzsche ascribed to it: namely, an effect of domination that
reiterates impotence, a substitute for action, for power, for
self-affirmation that reinscribes incapacity, powerlessness, and
rejection. For Nietzsche, ressentiment itself is rooted in reaction-the
substitution of reasons, norms, and ethics for deeds-and he suggests
that not only moral systems but identities themselves take their
bearings in this reaction]{.underline}. As Tracy Strong reads this
element of Nietzsche\'s thought: [**Identity \... does not consist of an
active component, but is reaction to something outside**; action in
itself, with its inevitable self-assertive qualities, must then become
something evil, since it is identified with that against which one is
reacting. The will to power of slave morality must constantly reassert
that which gives definition to the slave: the pain he suffers by being
in the world. Hence any attempt to escape that pain will merely result
in the reaffirmation of painful structures. 28 If the \"cause\" of
ressentiment is suffering, its \"creative deed\" is the reworking of
this pain into a negative form of action, the \"imaginary revenge\" of
what Nietzsche terms \"natures denied the true reaction, that of deeds.
\"29 This revenge is achieved through the imposition of suffering \"on
whatever does not feel wrath and displeasure as he does\"30
(accomplished especially through the production of guilt), through the
establishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue, and through
casting strength and good fortune (\"privilege,·· as we say today) as
self-recriminating, as its own indictment in a culture of suffering:
\"it is disgraceful to be fortunate, there is too much
misery]{.underline}. \"\'1 But [in its attempt to displace its
suffering, identity structured by ressentiment at the same time becomes
invested in its own subjection.]{.underline} [This investment lies not
only in its discovery of a site of blame for its hurt will, not only in
its acquisition of recognition through its history of subjection (a
recognition predicated on injury, now righteously
revalued),]{.underline} [but also in the satisfactions of revenge, which
ceaselessly reenact even as they redistribute the injuries of
marginalization and subordination in a liberal discursive order that
alternately denies the very possibility of these things and]{.underline}
[blames those who experience them for their own condition]{.underline}.
**[Identity politics structured by ressentiment reverse without
subverting this blaming structure: they do not subject to critique the
sovereign subject of accountability that liberal individualism
presupposes, nor the economy of inclusion and exclusion that liberal
universalism establishes]{.underline}**. [Thus, politicized identity
that presents itself as a self-affirmation now appears as the opposite,
as predicated on and requiring its sustained rejection by a \"hostile
external world.\"]{.underline} Insofar as what Nietzsche calls slave
morality produces identity in reaction to power, insofar as identity
rooted in this reaction achieves its moral superiority by reproaching
power and action themselves as evil, **[identity structured by this
ethos becomes deeply invested in its own impotence]{.underline}**, even
while it seeks to assuage the pain of its powerlessness through its
vengeful moralizing, through its wide distribution of suffer-through its
reproach of power as such. [Politicized identity,]{.underline} premised
on exclusion and fueled by the humiliation and suffering imposed by its
historically structured impotence in the context of a discourse of
sover- eign individuals, [is as likely to seek generalized political
paralysis]{.underline}, to feast on generalized political impotence, [as
it is to seek its own or collective liberation through
empowerment]{.underline}. Indeed, [it is more likely to punish and
reproach]{.underline}-\"punishment is what revenge calls itself; with a
hypocritical lie it creates a good conscience for itself\"33\_[than to
find venues of self- affirming action]{.underline}. But contemporary
politicized identity\'s desire is not only shaped by the extent to which
the sovereign will of the liberal subject, articulated ever more nakedly
by disciplinary individuation and capitalist disinternments, is
dominated by late-twentieth-century configurations of political and
economic powers. [It is shaped]{.underline} as well [by]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} contemporary [problematic of history
itself]{.underline}, by the late modern rupture of history as a
narrative, as ended because it has lost its end-a rupture that
paradoxically gives history an immeasurable weight. As the grim
experience of reading Discipline and Punish makes clear, [there is a
sense in which the gravitational force of history is multiplied at
precisely the moment that history\'s narrative coherence and objectivist
foundation is refuted]{.underline}. As the problematic of power in
[history]{.underline} is resituated from subject positioning to subject
construction; as [power is seen to operate spatially]{.underline},
infiltrationally, \"microphysically\" [rather than]{.underline} only
[temporally]{.underline}, permeating every heretofore designated
\"interior\" space in social lives and individuals; [as]{.underline}
eroding historical metanarratives take with them both laws of history
and the futurity such laws purported to assure; as the presumed
continuity of history is replaced with a sense of its violent,
contingent, and ubiquitous force -history becomes that which has weight
but no trajectory, mass but no coherence, force but no direction: it is
war without ends or end. Thus, [the extent to which \"the tradition of
all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the
living\" is today unparalleled, even as history itself disintegrates as
a coherent category or practice]{.underline}. [We know ourselves to be
saturated by history, we feel the extraordinary force of its and
determinations; we are also steeped in a discourse of its
insignificance, above all, we know that history will no longer (always
already did not) act as our redeemer]{.underline}. I raise the question
of history because in thinking about late modern politicized identity\'s
structuring by ressentiment, I have thus far focused on its foundation
in the sufferings of a subordinated sovereign subject. Bur Nietzsche\'s
account of the logic of [ressentiment is also linked to that feature of
the will that is stricken by history, that rails against time itself,
that cannot \"will backwards,\" that cannot exert its power over the
past- either as a specific set of events or as time itself]{.underline}.
Willing liberates; but what is it that puts even the liberator himself
in fetters? \"It was\"-that is the name of the will\'s gnashing of teeth
and most secret melancholy. [Powerless against what has been done, he is
an angry spectator of all that is past]{.underline}. . . . He cannot
break time and time\'s covetousness, that is the will\'s loneliest
melancholy. Although Nietzsche appears here to be speaking of the will
as such, Zarathustra\'s own relationship to the will as a \"redeemer of
history\" makes clear that [this \"angry spectatorship\" can with great
difficulty be reworked as a perverse kind of mastery]{.underline}, a
mastery [that triumphs over the past by reducing its power, by remaking
the present against the terms of the past]{.underline}-in short, by a
project of self-transformation that arrays itself against its own
genealogical consciousness. In contrast with the human ruin he sees
everywhere around him-\"fragments and limbs and dreadful accidents\"-it
is Zarathustra\'s own capacity to discern and to make a future that
spares him from a rancorous sensibility, from crushing disappointment in
the liberatory promise of his will: The now and the past on earth-alas,
my friends, that is what I find most unendurable; and l should not know
how to live if I were not also a seer of that which must come. A seer, a
willer, a creator, a future himself and a bridge to the future-and alas,
also, as it were, a cripple at this bridge: all this is Zarathustra.
[Nietzsche]{.underline} here [discerns both the necessity and the near
impossibility]{.underline}- the extraordinary and fragile
achievement-[of formulating oneself as a creator of the future and a
bridge to the future in order to appease the otherwise inevitable rancor
of the will against time]{.underline}, in order to redeem the past by
lifting the weight of it, by reducing the scope of its determinations.
\"And how could I bear to be a man if man were not also a creator and
guesser of riddles and redeemer of accidents\'\" Of course,
Zarathustra\'s exceptionality in what he is willing to confront and
bear, in his capacities to overcome in order to create, is Nietzsche\'s
device for revealing us to ourselves. [The ordinary will, steeped in the
economy of slave morality, devises means \"to get rid of his melancholy
and to mock his dungeon,\" means that reiterate the cause of the
melancholy, that continually reinfect the narcissistic wound to its
capaciousness inflicted by the past. \"Alas,\" says Nietzsche, \"every
prisoner becomes a fool; and the imprisoned will redeems himself
foolishly. \"3\" From this foolish redemption-foolish because it does
not resolve the will\'s rancor but only makes a world in its image-is
born the wrath of revenge: \"that which was\" is the name of the stone
\[the will\] cannot move. And so he moves stones out of wrath and
displeasure, and he wreaks revenge on whatever does not feel wrath and
displeasure as he does. Thus the will, the liberator, took to hurting;
and on all who can suffer he wreaks revenge for his inability to go
backwards. This . . is what revenge is: the will\'s ill will against
time and its 'it was']{.underline}. \"?•9 **[Revenge as a \"reaction,\"
a substitute for the capacity to act, produces identity as both bound to
the history that produced it and as a reproach to the present which
embodies that history]{.underline}**. [The will that \"took to
hurting\'\' in its own impotence against its past becomes (in the form
of an identity whose very existence is due to heightened consciousness
of the immovability of its \"it was,\" its history of subordination) a
will that makes not only a psychological but a political practice of
revenge, a practice that reiterates the existence of an identity whose
present past is one of insistently irredeemable injury]{.underline}.
[This past cannot be redeemed unless the identity ceases to be invested
in it, and it cannot cease to be invested in it without giving up its
identity as such, thus giving up its economy of avenging and at the same
time perpetuating its hurt]{.underline}-\"when he then stills the pain
of the wound he at the same time infects that wound. \"40 [In its
emergence as a protest against marginalization or subordination,
politicized identity thus becomes attached to its own exclusion both
because it is premised on this exclusion for its very existence as
identity and because the formation of identity at the site of exclusion,
as exclusion, augments or \"alters the direction of the suffering\"
entailed in subordination or marginalization by finding a site of blame
for it. But in so doing, it installs its pain over its unredeemed
history in the very foundation of its political claim, in its demand for
recognition as identity. In locating a site of blame for its
powerlessness over its past-a past of injury, a past as a hurt will-and
locating a \"reason\" for the \"unendurable pain\" of social
powerlessness in the present, it converts this reasoning into an
ethicizing politics, a politics of recrimination that seeks to avenge
the hurt even while it reaffirms it, discursively codifies it.
Politicized identity thus enunciates itself, makes claims for itself,
only by entrenching, restating, dramatizing, and inscribing its pain in
politics; it can hold out no future-for itself or others-that triumphs
over this pain]{.underline}. The loss of historical direction, and with
it the loss of futurity characteristic of the late modern age, is thus
homologically refigured in the structure of desire of the dominant
political expression of the age: identity politics. In the same way, the
generalized political impotence produced by the ubiquitous yet
discontinuous networks of late modern political and economic power is
reiterated in the investments of late modern democracy's primary
oppositional political formations.

### 1NC - Impact---Dependence

#### Debate exacerbates these problems: the ballot writes suffering into identity and institutionalizes identity politics' dependence on suffering. Because debate already occurs against the backdrop of oppression, privilege, and suffering, the ballot can only ever be a vehicle for revenge.

**Brown 1995** \[Wendy, Professor of Political Science at Berkeley,
*States of Injury*, pp. 66-74\]

Liberalism contains from its inception a generalized incitement to what
Nietzsche terms ressentiment, the moralizing revenge of the powerless,
\"the triumph of the weak as weak. \"22 This incitement to ressentiment
inheres in two related constitutive paradoxes of liberalism: that
between individual liberty and social egalitarianism, a paradox which
produces failure turned to recrimination by the subordinated, and guilt
turned to resentment by the \"successful\"; and that between the
individualism that legitimates liberalism and the cultural homogeneity
required by its commitment to political universality, a paradox which
stimulates the articulation of politically significant differences on
the one hand, and the suppression of them on the other, and which offers
a form of articulation that presses against the limits of universalist
discourse even while that which is being articulated seeks to be
harbored within-included in-the terms of that universalism. Premising
itself on the natural equality of human beings, liberalism makes a
political promise of universal individual freedom in order to arrive at
social equality, or achieve a civilized retrieval of the equality
postulated in the state of nature. It is the tension between the
promises of individualistic liberty and the requisites of equality that
yields ressentiment in one of two directions, depending on the way in
which the paradox is brokered. A strong commitment to freedom vitiates
the fulfillment of the equality promise and breeds ressentiment as
welfare state liberalism\--attenuations of the unmitigated license of
the rich and powerful on behalf of the \"disadvantaged.\" Conversely, a
strong commitment to equality, requiring heavy state interventionism and
economic redistribution, attenuates the commitment to freedom and breeds
ressentiment expressed as neoconservative anti-statism, racism, charges
of reverse racism, and so forth. However, [it is not only the tension
between freedom and equality but the prior presumption of the
self-reliant and self-made capacities of liberal subjects, conjoined
with their unavowed dependence on and construction by a variety of
social relations and forces, that makes all liberal subjects, and not
only markedly disenfranchised ones, vulnerable to ressentiment: it is
their situatedness within power, their production by power, and liberal
discourse\'s denial of this situatedness and production that cast the
liberal subject into failure, the failure to make itself in the context
of a discourse in which its self-making is assumed, indeed, is its
assumed nature]{.underline}. [This failure, which Nietzsche calls
suffering, must either find a reason within itself (which redoubles the
failure) or a site of external blame upon which to avenge its hurt and
redistribute its pain. Here is Nietzsche\'s account of this moment in
the production of ressentiment: For every sufferer instinctively seeks a
cause for]{.underline} his [suffering]{.underline}, [more exactly, an
agent; still more specifically, a guilty agent who is susceptible to
suffering]{.underline}\--in short, some living thing upon which he can,
on some pretext or other, vent his affects, actually or in effigy \....
[This \... constitutes the actual physiological cause of ressentiment,
vengefulness, and the like: a desire to deaden pain by means of
affects\... to deaden, by means of a more violent emotion of any kind, a
tormenting, secret pain that is becoming unendurable, and to drive it
out of consciousness at least for the moment]{.underline}: for that one
requires an affect, as savage an affect as possible, and, in order to
excite that, any pretext at all.23 Ressentiment in this context is a
triple achievement: it produces an affect (rage, righteousness) that
overwhelms the hurt; it produces a culprit responsible for the hurt; and
it produces a site of revenge to displace the hurt (a place to inflict
hurt as the sufferer has been hurt). Together these operations both
ameliorate (in Nietzsche\'s term, \"anaesthetize\") and externalize what
is otherwise \"unendurable.\" In a culture already streaked with the
pathos of ressentiment for the reasons just discussed, there are several
distinctive characteristics of late modern postindustrial societies that
accelerate and expand the conditions of its production. My listing will
necessarily be highly schematic: First, the phenomenon William Connolly
names \"increased global contingency\" combines with the expanding
pervasiveness and complexity of domination by capital and bureaucratic
state and social networks to create an unparalleled individual
powerlessness over the fate and direction of one\'s own life,
intensifying the experiences of impotence, dependence, and gratitude
inherent in liberal capitalist orders and constitutive of
ressellfiment.24 Second, the steady desacralization of all regions of
life\--what Weber called disenchantment, what Nietzsche called the death
of god-would seem to add yet another reversal to Nietzsche\'s genealogy
of ressentiment as perpetually available to \"alternation of
direction.\" In Nietzsche\'s account, the ascetic priest deployed
notions of \"guilt, sin, sinfulness, depravity, damnation\" to \"direct
the ressentiment of the less severely afflicted sternly back upon
themselves \... and in this way exploited the bad instincts of all
sufferers for the purpose of self-discipline, self-surveillance, and
self-overcoming. \"25 However, the desacralizing tendencies of late
modernity undermine the efficacy of this deployment and turn
suffering\'s need for exculpation back toward a site of external
agency26 Third, the increased fragmentation, if not disintegration, of
all forms of association not organized until recently by the commodities
market-communities, churches, families-and the ubiquitousness of the
classificatory, individuating schemes of disciplinary society, combine
to produce an utterly unrelieved individual, one without insulation from
the inevitable failure entailed in liberalism\'s individualistic
construction. 27 ln short, [the characteristics of late modern secular
society, in which individuals are buffeted and controlled by global
configurations of disciplinary and capitalist power of extraordinary
proportions, and are at the same time nakedly individuated, stripped of
reprieve from relentless exposure and accountability for themselves,
together add up to an incitement to ressentiment that might have stunned
even the finest philosopher of its occasions and logics. Starkly
accountable yet dramatically impotent, the late modern liberal subject
quite literally seethes with ressentiment11]{.underline}. [Enter
politicized identity, now conceivable in part as both product of and
reaction to this condition, where \"reaction\" acquires the meaning
Nietzsche ascribed to it: namely, an effect of domination that
reiterates impotence, a substitute for action, for power, for
self-affirmation that reinscribes incapacity, powerlessness, and
rejection. For Nietzsche, ressentiment itself is rooted in reaction-the
substitution of reasons, norms, and ethics for deeds-and he suggests
that not only moral systems but identities themselves take their
bearings in this reaction]{.underline}. As Tracy Strong reads this
element of Nietzsche\'s thought: [**Identity \... does not consist of an
active component, but is reaction to something outside**; action in
itself, with its inevitable self-assertive qualities, must then become
something evil, since it is identified with that against which one is
reacting. The will to power of slave morality must constantly reassert
that which gives definition to the slave: the pain he suffers by being
in the world. Hence any attempt to escape that pain will merely result
in the reaffirmation of painful structures. 28 If the \"cause\" of
ressentiment is suffering, its \"creative deed\" is the reworking of
this pain into a negative form of action, the \"imaginary revenge\" of
what Nietzsche terms \"natures denied the true reaction, that of deeds.
\"29 This revenge is achieved through the imposition of suffering \"on
whatever does not feel wrath and displeasure as he does\"30
(accomplished especially through the production of guilt), through the
establishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue, and through
casting strength and good fortune (\"privilege,·· as we say today) as
self-recriminating, as its own indictment in a culture of suffering:
\"it is disgraceful to be fortunate, there is too much
misery]{.underline}. \"\'1 But [in its attempt to displace its
suffering, identity structured by ressentiment at the same time becomes
invested in its own subjection.]{.underline} [This investment lies not
only in its discovery of a site of blame for its hurt will, not only in
its acquisition of recognition through its history of subjection (a
recognition predicated on injury, now righteously
revalued),]{.underline} [but also in the satisfactions of revenge, which
ceaselessly reenact even as they redistribute the injuries of
marginalization and subordination in a liberal discursive order that
alternately denies the very possibility of these things and]{.underline}
[blames those who experience them for their own condition]{.underline}.
**[Identity politics structured by ressentiment reverse without
subverting this blaming structure: they do not subject to critique the
sovereign subject of accountability that liberal individualism
presupposes, nor the economy of inclusion and exclusion that liberal
universalism establishes]{.underline}**. [Thus, politicized identity
that presents itself as a self-affirmation now appears as the opposite,
as predicated on and requiring its sustained rejection by a \"hostile
external world.\"]{.underline} Insofar as what Nietzsche calls slave
morality produces identity in reaction to power, insofar as identity
rooted in this reaction achieves its moral superiority by reproaching
power and action themselves as evil, **[identity structured by this
ethos becomes deeply invested in its own impotence]{.underline}**, even
while it seeks to assuage the pain of its powerlessness through its
vengeful moralizing, through its wide distribution of suffer-through its
reproach of power as such. [Politicized identity,]{.underline} premised
on exclusion and fueled by the humiliation and suffering imposed by its
historically structured impotence in the context of a discourse of
sover- eign individuals, [is as likely to seek generalized political
paralysis]{.underline}, to feast on generalized political impotence, [as
it is to seek its own or collective liberation through
empowerment]{.underline}. Indeed, [it is more likely to punish and
reproach]{.underline}-\"punishment is what revenge calls itself; with a
hypocritical lie it creates a good conscience for itself\"33\_[than to
find venues of self- affirming action]{.underline}. But contemporary
politicized identity\'s desire is not only shaped by the extent to which
the sovereign will of the liberal subject, articulated ever more nakedly
by disciplinary individuation and capitalist disinternments, is
dominated by late-twentieth-century configurations of political and
economic powers. [It is shaped]{.underline} as well [by]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} contemporary [problematic of history
itself]{.underline}, by the late modern rupture of history as a
narrative, as ended because it has lost its end-a rupture that
paradoxically gives history an immeasurable weight. As the grim
experience of reading Discipline and Punish makes clear, [there is a
sense in which the gravitational force of history is multiplied at
precisely the moment that history\'s narrative coherence and objectivist
foundation is refuted]{.underline}. As the problematic of power in
[history]{.underline} is resituated from subject positioning to subject
construction; as [power is seen to operate spatially]{.underline},
infiltrationally, \"microphysically\" [rather than]{.underline} only
[temporally]{.underline}, permeating every heretofore designated
\"interior\" space in social lives and individuals; [as]{.underline}
eroding historical metanarratives take with them both laws of history
and the futurity such laws purported to assure; as the presumed
continuity of history is replaced with a sense of its violent,
contingent, and ubiquitous force -history becomes that which has weight
but no trajectory, mass but no coherence, force but no direction: it is
war without ends or end. Thus, [the extent to which \"the tradition of
all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the
living\" is today unparalleled, even as history itself disintegrates as
a coherent category or practice]{.underline}. [We know ourselves to be
saturated by history, we feel the extraordinary force of its and
determinations; we are also steeped in a discourse of its
insignificance, above all, we know that history will no longer (always
already did not) act as our redeemer]{.underline}. I raise the question
of history because in thinking about late modern politicized identity\'s
structuring by ressentiment, I have thus far focused on its foundation
in the sufferings of a subordinated sovereign subject. Bur Nietzsche\'s

[Presenting a collective identity like ''black'' as homogenous, static,
and bounded as monovalent recognition movements do enables that identity
to be understood as one part of a]{.underline} symbolic [system in which
identities are mutually exclusive.]{.underline} And in such a system, as
Jacques Derrida, Stuart Hall, and others have forcefully argued, [the
traits associated with one group will always be privileged. Highlighting
the multiplicity of black identity and unmooring blackness from a
speciﬁc and limited set of characteristics challenges white dominance
without promoting intragroup repression or exclusion.]{.underline} The
politics of recognition given skeletal form by Elizabeth Alexander aims
to do just this. Actors engaged in a politics of multivalent recognition
aim to [positively revalue a collective identity by disrupting the
symbolic system that beneﬁts the hegemonic group.]{.underline} The
politics of monovalent recognition contests a racist world view in which
black and white are different and unequal by communicating that
identities are different from one another but either that (1) identities
are of equal value or (2) that the marginalized identity is actually
superior. Yet like the racist worldview[, monovalent recognition
movements reinforce the assumption that differences exist between
identities but not within an identity---that all black people are the
same.]{.underline} Moving beyond the symbolic conﬁnes set by the
hegemonic group or ''negating the negation'' involves [highlighting the
difference that exists within identity categories through demands for
recognition]{.underline}. [Identity claims are integral to this negation
of the negatio]{.underline}n. Yet, [these demands are neither for
recognition of a universal identity (i.e., human, citizen) nor for
recognition of a political identity that cuts across identity groups
(i.e., ''the left'').]{.underline} Unlike these forms of recognition
politics---wherein actors deemphasize the identity that marks them as
particular---[those who seek multivalent recognition explicitly identify
themselves as particular (i.e., as ''black'').]{.underline} In other
words, for those engaged in multivalent recognition, ''[it is not the
existence of \[identity\] categories that is the problem, but rather the
meaning and particular values attached to them'']{.underline} (Crenshaw
1991, 1297; also see Hancock 2007). [Contesting the meaning and values
attached to an identity category requires working with, within, and
through a particular identity: it requires offering ''racialized but not
delimited'' visions of identity]{.underline}.5 While black people
engaged in a politics of multivalent recognition demand recognition as
black, they demand recognition as not only black. They simultaneously
[demand recognition for other salient aspects of their
identity---demanding recognition as black and.]{.underline}\... This
''and'' can draw attention to [the membership of black individuals other
categorical identity groups]{.underline} (black and woman, black and
gay, black and poor, etc.)6 But [it also strategically links blackness
with traits, values, abilities, talents, and predilections with which
the collective identity has not previously been predominantly
associated.]{.underline} In a politics of multivalent recognition, black
feminist lower-class men, black gay Jews, and rural black working-class
single mothers demand recognition of their embodiments of and claim to
blackness, and in turn strategically de-essentialize blackness. [They
demand to be recognized as ''black'' despite the fact that they
contradict stereotypes of/about blackness]{.underline}. If a politics of
monovalent recognition aims for ﬁxity and thus transparency (Markell
2003) in identity, then [a politics of multivalent recognition is about
unﬁxing an identity]{.underline}.7 The unﬁxing that a politics of
multivalent recognition aims to accomplish, however, should be
[distinguished from the deconstruction]{.underline} that some
anti-identity theorists hope to achieve. Unlike an anti-identity
politics such as that recommended by Monique Wittig (1985), the ultimate
purpose of a politics of multivalent recognition is not to do away with
those collective identities that have been subject to oppression.
Whereas Wittig envisions a world without identity (more speciﬁcally,
gender) distinctions, those who engage in a politics of multivalent
[recognition aim for a world in which identity categories are more
capacious. Highlighting the ''multivalence'' of the identity
category---its multiple meanings, the diversity within---stretches its
symbolic boundaries.]{.underline} Disparate individuals' demands for
recognition of their claim to blackness prompt group members and members
of other identity groups to broaden their understanding of black
identity. In doing so, [they complicate the distinctions drawn between
black and white, distinctions that help reproduce
inequality]{.underline}. A politics of multivalent recognition operates
on the assumption that we need not do away with identity categories to
[break down hierarchical symbolic distinctions and transform identity
relations.]{.underline} Unﬁxing is distinct from deconstruction that
goes ''all the way down.''

themselves in a determined history.]{.underline} To have been shipped is

dispossessed feelings in common, to create a new feel in the

common. This form [of feeling was not collective, not given to decision,

feel for feeling others feeling you.]{.underline} This is [modernity's
insurgent feel, its inherited caress, its skin talk, tongue touch,
breath speech, hand laugh. This is the feel that no individual can
stand, and no state abide.]{.underline} This is the feel we might call
hapticality[. Hapticality,]{.underline} the touch of the undercommons,
[the interiority of sentiment,]{.underline} the feel that what is to
come is here. Hapticality, [the capacity to feel though others, for
others to feel through you, for you to feel them feeling you, this feel
of the shipped is not regulated, at least not successfully, by a state,
a religion, a people, an empire, a piece of land, a totem.]{.underline}
Or perhaps we could say these are now recomposed in the wake of the
shipped. To feel others is unmediated, immediately social, amongst us,
our thing, and even when we recompose religion, it comes from us, and
even when we recompose race, we do it as race women and men. Refused
these things, we first refuse them, in the contained, amongst the
contained, lying together in the ship, the boxcar, the prison, the
hostel. Skin, against epidermalisation, senses touching. [Thrown
together touching each other we were denied all sentiment, denied all
the things that were supposed to produce sentiment, family, nation,
language, religion, place, home.]{.underline} Though [forced to touch
and be touched, to sense and be sensed in that space of no space, though
refused sentiment, history and home, we feel (for) each other. A feel, a
sentiment with its own interiority, there on skin, soul no longer inside
but there for all to hear, for all to move. Soul music]{.underline} is a
medium of this interiority on the skin, [its regret the lament for
broken hapticality,]{.underline} its self-regulatory powers the
invitation to build [sentimentality together again, feeling each other
again]{.underline}, how we party. [This is our hapticality, our
love]{.underline}. This is love for the shipped, love as the shipped.
There's a touch, a feel you want more of, which releases you. The
closest Marx ever got to the general antagonism was when he said "from
each according to his ability, to each according to his need" but we
have read this [as the possession of ability and the possession of
need.]{.underline} What if we thought of the experiment of the hold as
the absolute fluidity, the informality, of this condition of need and
ability? What if ability and need were in constant play and we found
someone who dispossessed us so that this movement was our inheritance.
Your love makes me strong, your love makes me weak. What if "the between
the two," the lost desire, the articulation, was this rhythm, this
inherited experiment of the shipped in the churning waters of flesh and
expression that could grasp by letting go ability and need in constant
recombination. [If he moves me, sends me, sets me adrift in this way,
amongst us in the undercommons. So long as she does this, she does not
have to be.]{.underline}

As the fences in my gentrifying, whiten- ing neighborhood grow higher
and higher, the political, economic, and per- sonal functions of limits
in cultures of phallicized whiteness become more and more clear. [Limits
constitute property and propriety. Demarcating a 'body' or 'subject'
from the vagueness of backgrounds, conditions, cultures, or histories,
they serve as the site of individuation.]{.underline} [They circumvent
an entity, orienting us toward the criterion of 'wholeness,' a primary
demand of legibility in cultures of phallicized whiteness.]{.underline}
Not unlike the rit- uals of urination contests among male dogs, limits
mark out our territories. [They ground our deep senses of ourselves as
individuals, our narratives of ahistorical autonomous
self-determination, and the many cultural forms of that self-
determination.]{.underline} In a slightly different mode, limits also
function as internal and external constraints of possibility that frame
personal, social, or even economic fields. We understand ourselves, for
example, as limited internally by our social and cultural backgrounds or
as constrained by our financial resources. Or, exter- nally, limits also
function as thresholds that stand at the outer limit of ex- periences
and cannot be trespassed, exercising an external authoritative re-
straint that expresses itself as a prohibition. For example, nations
(most nations, at least) are restrained and limited by international
law; or, more locally, I may simply realize that, with age encroaching,
my limit is three drinks. In all of these, [limits function as that
which one (a social attitude, a political entity, a person) cannot or
must not go beyond.]{.underline} [They indicate thresholds of
experience, forming the contours of our desire and subjectivity, whether
internally or externally imposed. When framed as prohibitions, they
incite our desire: death and drugs, along with sex and love, are the
most commonly explored 'limit experiences.']{.underline} Across all of
these functions, a common operation is at work. [From the function of
limits as internal conditions of possibility or external boundaries of
restraint to the demarcations of wholeness and individuation, limits
constitute legibility.]{.underline} One belongs to one's cultural
background, gaining identity and di- rection from its historical
particularity; nations that disobey international law are "imperialist"
or "rogue states," depending on their economic might; I am a hung-over
sop, not an interesting person, the morning after an evening of more
than three drinks; and, fundamentally to all of these, [a true
individual is he or she who can clearly stake his or her own
identity---psychologically, politically, economically---in the chaotic
world.]{.underline} It is this last phenomenon, the demarcating of the
individual and all its permutations, that I want to explore and develop,
rooting it particularly in the modern political projects of classical
liberalism and their attendant concepts of freedom. [The logic of the
limit thus expresses itself in two fundamental registers: as enclosure
and as prohibition.]{.underline} These two registers are dialectically
related. [The demarcating of entities (persons, experiences, ideas,
institutions) clearly and distinctly from other entities and from
historico-cultural backgrounds enacts a mode of separation that leads us
to frame desire as the careful negotiation---and prohibition---of
boundaries.]{.underline} For example, [we introduce ownership on the
model of private property into the social field when we conceive of an
entity as individuated on the basis of its enclosure and containment by
clear boundaries.]{.underline} [This model of ownership, grounded in a
fun- damental preference for labor that enacts a futural temporality, in
turn ini- tiates an economics of scarcity into the field of social
relations.]{.underline} [We demand that we must demarcate that which is
properly "ours." Private property comes to dominate our senses of the
world---of our selves, others, objects, and all possible relations
therein. Each becomes a quantifiable unit. As the social field is
reduced to modes of ownership, scarcity comes to dominate the kinds of
relations that obtain therein. The fear of encroachment begins to
override any desire to cross these clear and distinct
boundaries.]{.underline} And the crossing of boundaries, whether between
persons, classes, sexes, races, nations, or relig- ions, becomes
prohibited. [Boundaries differentiate us; individuation becomes our most
precious value; and the crossing of boundaries is forbidden, creating
that tantalizing social realm of fetish and taboo.]{.underline} The two
registers of the logic of the limit, enclosure and prohibition, are
thereby analytically distinct, but functionally intertwined. The
resilience of phallicized whiteness and its domination of the social
field in cultures of late modernity depend on these subtle, often
unnoticed if not invisible, dy- namics. [Both enclosure and prohibition
collude to ground the fundamental values of freedom and individualism,
all bound by the model of private property and the fundamental value of
labor that enacts a futural temporality, in cultures of phallicized
whiteness.]{.underline}

#### Their ahistoric understanding of the harms of the 1AC rely on an assumption of objectivity within analysis that is not intrinsic but rooted in the identity of the liberal individual---that ignorance of how markers of race, class, sexuality, gender, and social location falls short of understanding how the lack of markers thereof fails to truly understand the problem and forecloses alternative understandings of the self

**Winnubst 6** \[Shannon Winnubst is a Chair and Professor of Women's,

Locke's normative model for the liberal individual thereby becomes he
who is bound by his ability to labor within a concept of the future
sufficient to stake out a piece of land as property. While Cynthia
Willett gives Locke credit for trying to articulate a middle-class
resistance to "the leisure class and its idle games," she nonetheless
argues that Locke remains entrapped by a conception of rationality "in
terms of the English middle-class appreciation for the market value of
productive labor and property" (2001, 71). Not only are his concepts of
rationality shaped by these historical preferences, but his concepts of
man's condition---man's desire, destiny, labor, and individuality--- all
carry these historical preferences into universalized discourses that
continue to serve as the bedrock of many of our cultural assumptions and
practices. Although [Locke's politics]{.underline} were moderately
progressive for the late seventeenth century, the lasting damage of
these concepts [still haunts our political quandaries and the very
frameworks through which we continue to seek redress. The logic of limit
as enclosure, as the ways that the state of society becomes demarcated
from---and always preferred over, even while romanticizing---the state
of nature, continuously rewrites itself in several registers across the
political histories of the U.S. It fundamentally grounds our
understanding of the individual as the person who is clearly demarcated
from nature.]{.underline} The individual becomes that 'civilized' man
who takes his natural origin, as an enclosed body that is a product of
God's labor, and produces private property that is enclosed into durable
forms which persist into and even control the future. From this critical
enclosure of the world and the self, written in the register of
property, other modern epistemologies and political projects easily
attach themselves to this clear and distinct unit, the individual. (Adam
Smith, for example, quickly comes to mind.) [The individual, carved out
of nature through productive labor and conceiving the world and himself
on the model of appropriating private property, emerges as the
cornerstone of political theories and practices in cultures of
phallicized whiteness.]{.underline} The individual thereby comes to
function as an ahistorical unit defined by its productive labor's
distancing relation to the state of nature, not by any
historico-political forces. (With his unhistorical thinking, Locke acts
per- fectly as a liberal individual.) [Classical liberalism writes the
individual as the (allegedly) neutral substratum of all political
decisions, positioning it as separable from historico-political
forces.]{.underline} [In carving the individual out of both the natural
and socio-historico-political landscapes, modern political and
epistemological projects turn around Locke's fundamental metaphors of
enclosure.]{.underline} [The individual, that seat of political and
personal subjectivity, is *enclosed* and thus cut off from all other
forces circulating in the social environment.]{.underline} [The
individual effectively functions as a piece of private property, with
the strange twist of owning itself, impervious to all intruders and
protected by the inherent right of ownership, derived from the
ontological right to one's own enclosed body.]{.underline} History then
is reduced to a collection of what Kelly Oliver has aptly called
"discrete facts that can be known or not known, written in history
books, and \[that\] are discontinuous with the present" (2001, 130).
History is that collection of events that occurred in the past and is
now tightly sealed in that past. History is simply what has happened,
with no fundamental effect or influence upon what is happening now or
might happen in the future. [Historicity is unthought and unthinkable
here. The modern rational self---the liberal individual---exists in a
temporally and historically sealed vacuum, made possible by the clear
disjunction between past, present, and future.]{.underline} [Cartesian
concepts of time as discrete moments that do not enter into contact or
affect one another dominate this conception of the
individual.]{.underline}10 The logic of the limit thereby demarcates the
past sharply and neatly from the present, turning each into objects
about which we can develop concepts, facts, and truths. The future, that
temporal horizon initiated by preferred forms of complex labor, becomes
the sole focus of intention and desire. But the future never arrives.
Therefore, if historicity and 'the historical' mean reading present
ideas, values, or concepts as undergoing a constant shaping and
reshaping by material forces, [this divorce of the past from the present
effectively renders all temporal zones---past, present, future, and all
permutations---ahistorical. Existence itself is radically
dehistoricized. And the individual, that bastion of political activity
and value, accordingly resides in a historical vacuum, untouched by
historical forces---the very realm of whiteness.]{.underline} This
ahistorical view of history perpetuates the modern project of clas-
sical liberalism and its damages, creating a particular kind of
individual. The individual becomes the locus of identity, selfhood, and
subjectivity in the modern political project. Demarcated from historical
existence, it also re- quires careful delineation from other bodies,
whether persons, institutions, history, or social attitudes. [This
concept of the individual develops with a pronounced insistence on its
neutrality, rendering specific attributes of the individual merely
particular qualities that function, again, on the model of private
property: characteristics such as race, gender, religion, or nationality
remain at a distance from this insistently neutral
individual.]{.underline} (I use the pro- noun "it" to emphasize the
function of this alleged neutrality, a dynamic that is central to the
valorization of the white propertied Christian male as the subject of
power in phallicized whiteness.) [This insular existence, under- scored
by its ahistorical status, is further ensured by claims of radical
autonomy, whereby the individual is the source, site, and endpoint of
all actions, desires, thoughts, and behaviors: we choose what we
do.]{.underline} And we choose it, of course, because we are rational:
Kantian ethics become the proper bookend to Locke's initiating of "high
modernity's"11 schemas. [This demarcation of the individual then carves
the critical division between internal and external, and its
political-psychic counterpart, that between self and Other.]{.underline}
The self is located squarely and exclusively in one's rational
faculties, the natural law that, according to Locke, civilizes us into
economies of labor, utility, and a strange mix of scarcity and
abundance. [The modern rational self is radically
self-contained---enclosed. It is a sovereign self, unaffected by and
independent from any thing or force external to it, whether materiality
or the Other.]{.underline} [Assuming it exercises rationality
appropriately, this self is radically autonomous, choosing its own place
in the world.]{.underline} (Pointing to America, Locke insists that
civilized men are free to leave society.) It does not heed any call of
the Other. It is effectively autog- enous, existing in a pre-Hegelian
philosophical world.12 Utility and its epistemological counterpart,
instrumentality, subsequently become the operative conceptions of power
in this schema of the liberal individual as the self. Autonomous,
autogenous, and ahistorical, the modern rational individual is in full
control of its self. [Its power is thereby something that it owns and
wields, as it chooses.]{.underline} Power is not some force that might
shape the individual without its assent or, at a minimum, its
acknowledg- ment. It is something that an individual, even if in the
form of an individual state, wields intentionally. [It can still use
this power legitimately or illegitimately, but that is a matter of
choice. The individual controls power and the ways that it affects the
world: this is its expression of freedom.]{.underline} Accordingly, the
role of the law becomes to vigilantly protect this ahistorical unit, the
individual, from the discriminations and violences of historical
vicissitudes. [The role of the law is to protect the individual's power,
the seat of its freedom.]{.underline} We are far from Foucaultian ideas
that perhaps power and history constitute the ways we view and
experience the world, shaping our categories and embedding us in this
very notion of the individual as autonomous, au- togenous, and
ahistorical. [The liberal individual, untouched by material, po-
litical, and historical conditions, is a neutral substratum that freely
wields its power as it chooses: this is the liberal sovereignty and
mastery of freedom.]{.underline} [Because the individual is this neutral
substratum, differences may or may not attach themselves to it. But
those differences are cast into that inconsequential space of material
conditions along with history and the Other.]{.underline} The odd twist
of self-ownership surfaces more fully here. Following Locke's metaphors
of enclosure, [the individual is enclosed and sealed off not only from
all historical and social forces in the environment, but also from the
very attributes of difference within itself.]{.underline} While specific
attributes that con- stitute "difference" in North American culture
continuously shift, with new categories emerging and old ones receding,
the particular vector of difference that matters depends on our
historical location, and all its complexities.13 [Consequently, these
attributes do not fundamentally affect the neutrality of the modern
individual. These differences occur at the level of the body and
history, realms of existence that do not touch the self-contained
individual.]{.underline} [The neutral individual relates to these
differences through the models of enclosure and ownership.]{.underline}
[It experiences these discrete parts of itself (e.g., race, gender,
religion, nationality) as one owns a variety of objects in economies of
(scarce) private property: one chooses when one wishes to purchase, own,
display, or wear such objects as one freely desires.]{.underline} The
unnerving in- fluence of power surfaces, however, as we realize that
[this free choice becomes the exclusive power of the subject position
valorized in cultures of phallicized whiteness]{.underline}, [the white
propertied Christian (straight) male]{.underline}14 [who determines
when, how, and which differences matter.]{.underline}

#### This means that everything they say is wrong---absent an understanding of how a lack of markers of gender, race, and sex the 1AC is just another attempt of phallicized whiteness to achieve objective rationality foreclosing any political action reinscribing those narratives of innocence endemic to the cis white man's attempt to wash his hands of accountability

**Winnubst 6** \[Shannon Winnubst is a Chair and Professor of Women's,
Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Ohio State University. "Queering
Freedom," Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 2006, p 51-52 //tjb\]

The concept of the individual should function as a bulwark against the
inappropriate uses of these various categories of difference, which are
at- tached to it in (merely) historical ways. [The judgment of how the
individual is functioning as an individual---i.e., as a neutral
individual untainted by differences such as race, religion, sex, or
national origin---should serve as the baseline against which to
determine whether discrimination or preference is being
enacted.]{.underline} [The terms of the laws, policies, and heated
social debates were set: the function of the law is to protect the
neutral individual from political, historical, and material conditions
that might infringe upon its in- herent right to express itself, its
power, its freedom.]{.underline} The constituent concepts of classical
liberalism find their full-blown expression here. And by the time Reagan
is elected in 1979 with his promises to halt affirmative action, his
language comes as little surprise: "We must not allow the noble concept
of equal opportunity to be distorted into federal guidelines or quotas
which require race, ethnicity, or sex---rather than ability and
qualifications---to be the principal factor in hiring or education"
(Mills 1994, 17). The neutral individual and its native abilities and
qualifications must be protected. [The model of ownership regarding
difference thereby dominates our political imaginations.]{.underline}
While the specificities of the various categories and their historical
emergences and recessions is worth noting (e.g., sex is a late addition;
race and color, as well as religion and creed, are separated; ethnic
origin seems to replace national origin; most of all, class is never
mentioned, despite its originary role in both Locke's thinking and the
1935 National Labor Relations Act), the dominant category at work in
this system is the same category that grounds classical liberalism and
phallicized whiteness: the neutral individual stands as the alpha and
omega of all deliberations. [All other differences, whether of religion,
race, sex, or some other attribute, are reduced to hindrances of the
individual's right to cultivate its native talents. The law must protect
and ensure equal opportunity, another focal category of affirmative
action debates, so that each individual---as an individual---will have
this right to develop. And this will only occur if the neutrality that
is necessary to the balance of equality is obtained and
ensured.]{.underline} This understanding of the law as the vehicle to
ensure and protect the neutrality of the individual seems to function on
all sides (well, both sides, in the binary U.S.) of the political
spectrum. Whether one supports or crit- icizes affirmative action, the
endpoint is never questioned---namely, the cre- ation of a society that
views individuals as individuals. [No one questions the desirability,
much less the ontological possibility, of a color-blind or gender- blind
society]{.underline} (or a religion-blind or national origin--blind one,
although these are almost unthinkable and increasingly unspeakable in
2003).29 But perhaps this is because the rhetoric of blindness and the
desirability of neutrality is endemic to cultures of phallicized
whiteness, circulating as an unspoken as- sumption about human nature
and the state of society, and functioning as a critical tool of power to
ensure the dominance of phallicized whiteness's subject position.
[Phallicized whiteness functions through erasing itself. Its power
derives from its invisibility. And this power grants it the right to
determine which, when, and how differences matter. Neutrality is one of
phallicized whiteness's most effective tools.]{.underline}

## 2AC -- AT Self-Ownership

### 2AC AT: Alt---Hapticality

#### Embracing pathology is the only way to divest from dominant structures of antiblackness 

**Sexton 16** (Sexton, Jared. \"The social life of social death: On
Afro-pessimism and Black optimism.\" In Time, Temporality and Violence

<http://www.yorku.ca/intent/issue5/articles/jaredsexton.php)//e-toth>

Lewis Gordon's sustained engagement finds Fanon situated in an ethical
stance grounded in the affirmation of blackness in the historic
antiblack world. In a response to the discourse of multiracialism
emergent in the late twentieth-century United States, for instance,
Gordon writes, following Fanon, that "there is no way to reject the
thesis that there is something wrong with being black beyond the
willingness to 'be' black -- in terms of convenient fads of playing
blackness, but in paying the costs of antiblackness on a global scale.
[Against the raceless credo, then, racism cannot be rejected without a
dialectic in which humanity experiences a blackened world"]{.underline}
(Gordon 1997: 67). What is this willingness to 'be' black, of choosing
to be black affirmatively rather than reluctantly, that Gordon finds as
the key ethical moment in Fanon? [Back to
top](http://www.yorku.ca/intent/issue5/articles/jaredsexton.php#top)
\[23\] Elsewhere, in a discussion of Du Bois on the study of black folk,
Gordon restates an existential phenomenological conception of the
antiblack world developed across his first several books: "Blacks here
suffer the phobogenic reality posed by the spirit of racial seriousness.
In effect, they more than symbolize or signify various social
pathologies---they become them. In our antiblack world, blacks are
pathology" (Gordon 2000: 87). [This conception would seem to support
Moten's contention that even much radical black studies scholarship
sustains the association of blackness with a certain sense of decay and
thereby fortifies and extends the interlocutory life of widely accepted
political common sense. In fact, it would seem that Gordon deepens the
already problematic association to the level of identity. And yet, this
is precisely what Gordon argues is the value and insight of Fanon: he
fully accepts the definition of himself as pathological as it is imposed
by a world that knows itself through that imposition, rather than
remaining in a reactive stance that insists on the (temporal, moral,
etc.) heterogeneity between a self and an imago originating in culture.
Though it may appear counterintuitive, or rather because it is
counterintuitive, this acceptance or affirmation is active; it is a
willing or willingness, in other words, to pay whatever social costs
accrue to being black, to inhabiting blackness, to living a black social
life under the shadow of social death. This is not an accommodation to
the dictates of the antiblack world. The affirmation of blackness, which
is to say an affirmation of pathological being, is a refusal to distance
oneself from blackness in a valorization of minor differences that bring
one closer to health, to life, or to sociality.]{.underline} Fanon
writes in the first chapter of Black Skin, White Masks, "The Black Man
and Language": "A Senegalese who learns Creole to pass for Antillean is
a case of alienation. The Antilleans who make a mockery out of him are
lacking in judgment" (Fanon 2008: 21). [In a world structured by the
twin axioms of white superiority and black inferiority, of white
existence and black nonexistence, a world structured by a negative
categorical imperative---"above all, don't be black" (Gordon 1997:
63)---in this world, the zero degree of transformation is the turn
toward blackness, a turn toward the shame, as it were, that "resides in
the idea that 'I am thought of as less than human'" (Nyong'o 2002:
389).[xiv](http://www.yorku.ca/intent/issue5/articles/jaredsexton.php#footnotexiv)
In this we might create a transvaluation of pathology itself, something
like an embrace of pathology without pathos.]{.underline} [Back to
top](http://www.yorku.ca/intent/issue5/articles/jaredsexton.php#top)
\[24[\] To speak of black social life and black social death, black
social life against black social death, black social life as black
social death, black social life in black social death---all of this is
to find oneself in the midst of an argument that is also a profound
agreement, an agreement that takes shape in (between) meconnaissance and
(dis)belief]{.underline}. Black optimism is not the negation of the
negation that is afro-pessimism, just as black social life does not
negate black social death by inhabiting it and vitalizing it. [A living
death is as much a death as it is a living. Nothing in afro-pessimism
suggests that there is no black (social) life, only that black life is
not social life in the universe formed by the codes of state and civil
society, of citizen and subject, of nation and culture, of people and
place, of history and heritage, of all the things that colonial society
has in common with the colonized, of all that capital has in common with
labor---the modern world system. Black life is not lived in the world
that the world lives in, but it is lived underground, in outer space.
This is agreed. That is to say, what Moten asserts against
afro-pessimism is a point already affirmed by afro-pessimism, is, in
fact, one of the most polemical dimensions of afro-pessimism as a
project: namely, that black life is not social, or rather that black
life is lived in social death.]{.underline} Double emphasis, on lived
3and on death. That's the whole point of the enterprise at some level.
It is all about the implications of this agreed- upon point where
arguments (should) begin, but they cannot (yet) proceed. [Back to

[The modern Western academy was created as the repository and guarantor
of national culture as well as a cultivator and innovator of political
economy.]{.underline} As such, the academy is an archive of sorts, whose
technologiesor so the theory goes-are constantly refined to acquire the
latest innovation. As an archiving institution, the academy is-to use
Derrida\'s description of the archive- \"institutive and conservative.
Revolutionary and traditional. An eco-nomic archive in this double
sense: it keeps, it puts in reserve, it saves, but in an unnatural
fashion, that is to say in making the law (nomos) or in making people
respect the law.\"25 The academy has always been an eco-nomic domain;
that is, it has simultaneously determined who gets admitted while
establishing the rules for membership and participation. In the context
of the post-World War II United States, the American academy can be read
as a record of the shifts and contradictions of political economy.
Indeed, with the admission of women and people of color into
predominantly white academic settings, the eco-nomic character of the
American academy did not simply vanish. The academy would begin to put,
keep in reserve, and save minoritized subjects and knowledges in an
archival fashion, that is, by devising ways to make those subjects and
knowledges respect power and its \"laws.\" Put differently, the ethnic
and women\'s studies movements applied pressures on the archival
conventions of the academy in an effort to stretch those conventions so
that previously excluded subjects might enjoy membership. But it also
meant that those subjects would fall under new and revised laws. [As a
distinct archival economy, the American academy would help inform the
archival agendas of state and capital-how best to institute new peoples,
new knowledges, and cultures and at the same time discipline and exclude
those subjects according to a new order. **This was the moment in which
power would hone its own archival economy, producing formulas for the
incorporation rather than the absolute repudiation of difference, all
the while refining and perfecting its practices of exclusion and
regulation.**]{.underline} **[This is the time when power would restyle
its archival propensities by dreaming up ways to affirm difference and
keep it in hand. Ethnic studies and women\'s studies movements were the
prototypical re\~ources of incorporative and archival systems of power
that reinvented themselves because of civil rights and liberation
movements of the fifties, sixties, and seventies.]{.underline} [Part of
the signature achievements of these affirmative modes of power was to
make the pursuit of recognition and Introduction 13 legitimacy into
formidable horizons of pleasure, insinuating themselves into radical
politics, trying to convince insurgents that \"your dreams are also
mine.\"]{.underline}**

The influence that the student movements had on institutional life
within the United States points to a need to assess the streams of the
academy within political economy. [If state and particularly capital
needed the academy to reorient their sensibilities toward the
affirmation of differencethat is, to complete the constitutional project
of the United States and begin to resolve the contradictions of social
exclusion -then it also meant that the academy became the laboratory for
the revalorization of modes of difference. This changing set of
representations, the institutions that organized themselves around that
set, and the modes of power that were compelled by and productive of
those transformations are what we are calling the
interdisciplines.]{.underline} The interdisciplines were an ensemble of
institutions and techniques that offered positivi ties to populations
and constituencies that had been denied institutional claims to agency.
**[Hence, the interdisciplines connoted a new form of biopower organized
around the affirmation, recognition, and legitimacy of minoritized
life.]{.underline}** To offset their possibility for future ruptures,
power made legitimacy and recognition into grand enticements. 14
Introduction In doing so, they would become power\'s newest techniques
for the taking of difference. **[What the students often offered as
radical critiques of institutional belonging would be turned into

[Critiques of the university that presume the derivative nature of the
academy from the economy implicitly and unconsciously place a ban on
modes of difference as sites of political subjectivization. They become
spaces of consensus as they dismiss minority culture and minority
difference as formations completely overwhelmed and determined by
commodity culture, whether within or outside the academy. Such stances
disqualify minority difference and minority culture as potential sites
of dissensus with the potential to create fissures and to make room for
the inadmissible. Given the flexibility of minority difference, ours
must be an ongoing experimentation with the ruptural possibilities of
modes of difference.]{.underline} The Reorder of Things is, therefore, a
provocation to not only evaluate the vulnerabilities of sixties social
movements and the interdisciplinary formations that they inspired but
also \"develop modes of analyses which \... are capable of discerning,
in good faith, the finite but significant openness of many actual
initiatives and contributions. \"3! [Such an investigation requires that
we find ways to slip away from the archival maneuvers of
power/knowledge, recognizing that power\'s archival advance is ever
encroaching]{.underline}. The context of powerlknowledge might be the
occasion for interdisciplinarity\'s revival rather than its demise. The
possibility for a generative inquiry into institutionality lies in the
interrogation of those relationships between textuality and
institutionality and what they reveal about the co-constitutive
anatomies of institutional belonging and minoritized subject formations.
As a letter frames a plane crash, so the academic frames our social
predicament. In doing so, the collage suggests the means by which
minority difference is brought into regimes of representation and
fundamentally reconstitutes them. This examination is the business of a
critical interdisciplinarity. So, this is what inspires me to tell you
not to forsake this image and the lessons that it bears. Some will see
this picture and become like that Watcher who \"turns his eyes away in
resignation\" as his dreams are mocked to death by power and
institutions, his cynicism validated by his experience of the facts.
Others-not beholden to any breed of positivism-will take its cautions to
mind and heart, crafting deeds and working up visions that are in the
institution but not of it, knowing that the dream is still the truth.

In addition to being archivable elements for a transforming U.S.
nationstate, social movements in the post-World War II era were also
crucial \"documents\" for that archiving apparatus known as contemporary
global capitalism. In his classic essay \"The Local and the Global,\"
Stuart Hall locates the social movements that Omi, Winant, and Edgar
discuss within the emergence of a new trajectory for global capitalism.
Specifically, Hall points to the ways in which the emergence of various
social movements II. Ilf II, I I \~ I , I I I II i I i \~- 26 The Birth
of the I nterdisciplines around race and feminism were part of the same
historic moment in which global capital set its sights on local
difference. Global capital\'s turn toward local difference was
simultaneous with an epistemic turn toward vernacular cultures as well[.
According to Hall, the emergence of contemporary globalization was
simultaneous with the emergence of anticolonial, black liberation, and
feminist movements, the time when \"the unspoken discovered that they
had a history that they could speak, that they had languages other than
the languages of the master.]{.underline}\"19 For Hall, liberatory
movements were both political and epistemological formations that
attempted to simultaneously disinter and reconstruct subjugated
histories around race, gender, and nation. [Unearthing and reinventing
those histories was also not unrelated or coincidental to global
capital\'s interest in local cultures and differences.]{.underline} [As
the grip of the nation-state began to weaken because of the capitalist
crisis and the internationalization of the economy, the Western
nation-state also suffered-as Hall implies-because of the social and
epistemic crises brought about by movements led to a large degree by
students. Ironically, though, as those social movements advanced and
reconceptualized local culture and difference, bringing national culture
to crisis, capital turned toward local culture and difference in the
very moments that national identity was being revised.]{.underline}
[Contemporary globalization attempted to feed on those local histories
and languages, producing flexible regimes of accumulation \"founded on
segmented markets, on lifestyle and identity. \"20 Hence, one of the
ways in which capital mediated its split from a now weakened and damaged
nation-state was to work with and through the very local, vernacular,
and subjugated histories and differences that helped to bring the
nation-state to crisis in the first place.]{.underline} The beginnings
of contemporary global capital represented the simultaneous management
of difference and the international as well. In the context of the
United States and the relative collapse of a national culture that
portrayed itself as homogeneous, we can also see the ways in which the
American nation-state used local differences to mediate the upheavals
brought about by the student movements. For instance, in Michael Omi and
Howard Winant\'s Racial Formations in the United States, the authors
define the racial state in the moments after the various antiracist
movements in terms of the state\'s institutionalization of certain parts
of those movements, arguing that the \"The racial state, in its turn,
has been historically constructed by racial movements; it consists of
agencies and The Birth of the Interdisciplines 27 programs which are the
institutionalized responses to racial movements of the past. \"21 The
racial state for Omi and Winant is not simply the entity on which
political demands are made. It is also that political formation that
receives its identity and contours from having archived the social
movements. Building on the idea that the racial state is the
conglomerate of institutionalized responses to the sixties and seventies
social movements, [Omi and Winant go on to argue that state institutions
within the United States responded to political pressures of antiracist
movements by, in part, adopting policies of absorption.22 About
absorption, they state: \"Absorption reflects the realization that many
demands are greater threats to the racial order before they are accepted
than after they have been adopted in suitably moderate form.\"23 What
Omi and Winant refer to as \"absorption\" we might understand as the
gestures and routines of archival power. Indeed, in its absorptive
capacities, the state becomes a subarchive that \"documents\" past
struggles and thus achieves power through control of that broad
assemblage of \"documents\" known as \"the student movements.\" To speak
through and with local culture and difference and to absorb them, state
and capital needed the assistance of the academy. In point of fact, the
academy was positioned prominently in this moment because of its
historic task of representing national culture. In the moment of the
sixties- because of the student movements around race and gender-the
U.S. academy would take on the imperative of American literature. Put
plainly, it would attempt to resolve the contradictions that govern and
constitute the U.S. nation-state. In the moment of the multinational
firm\'s emergence and capital\'s explicit engagement in local culture
and difference, the academy would become the handbook on the absorption
and representation of those differences, the manual for state and
capital\'s unprecedented deliberation. As such, the U.S. academy would
become the model of archontic power-using and assimilating texts to
engage the problematic of \"e pluribus unum.\"]{.underline} In doing so,
U.S. higher education would become the capitol of archival power,
training state and economy in its methods of representation and
regulation. Rather than the academy losing importance because of the
attack on national culture, the American academy and things academic
would become the place where enfeebled institutions might make sense of
difference, its fortunes, and its disruptions.24 Things academic would
provide a new opportunity for power, one that would allow power 28 The
Birth of the Interdisciplines to foster an entirely new relation between
academy, capital, and state. This new relation would revolve around the
very question promoted by the u.s. student movements, the question of
minority difference - how to understand it, how to negotiate it, how to
promote it, and how to regulate it. This question would inspire power to
run a new archival errand. Put differently, we might say that the link
between the epistemological pressures brought about by social movements
of the sixties and seventies and the rise of global capital\'s interest
in local differences lies in the academy. [The entrance of local
cultures and differences into epistemological representation would also
inspire and inform their entrance into law and commodification-into
state and capital\'s arenas of representation. While this was the moment
in which state and capital suffered a devastating rupture, this was also
the period in which those entities began to enjoy a new form of
communicability with the academy. Through a reinvented discourse of
difference, power would inspire a new form of relationality between
state, capital, and academy. The academy-transformed by insurgent modes
of differences-would begin to educate state and capital into a new type
of awareness. The u.s. student movements would inspire power to focus
its maneuvers around the keywords of revolutionary upheavals- \"minority
autonomy,\" \"self-determination,\" and \"freedom.\" In doing so, power
would attempt to find ways to make the articulation of difference
consistent with power\'s guidance rather than antagonistic to it. In
their discussion of the minority movements of the sixties, Omi and
Winant argue: \"In response to political pressure, state institutions
adopt policies of absorption and insulation. Absorption reflects the
realization that many demands are greater threats to the racial order
before they are accepted than after they have been adopted in suitably
moderate form.\"25 We might read their theorization of the minority
movements of the sixties as an example of the \"economistic resource of
an archive which capitalizes·everything, even that which ruins it or
radically contests its power.\"26 In the sixties and thereafter, the
archival propensities of power reached out to new horizons, attempting
to archive the presumably unarchivable components of antiracism,
feminism, and so on. In doing so, power would attempt to invest the
radical aims of antiracist and feminist movements of the sixties and
seventies with another logic, capitalizing those movements and their
ensigns, cataloging them in the very institutions that those movements
were contesting]{.underline}. In sum, The Birth of the Interdisciplines
29 relations of power would try to make those movements and their
demands into its reason for being. [What came after the challenges of
the ethnic and women\'s movements was not the end of power but its new
beginning. In terms of national ideology, what came after those great
confrontations was not the downfall of a cultural center per se but its
reconfiguration. Indeed, the cultural center was recalibrated in terms
of diversification rather than standardization, no longer a center
organized around a homogeneous national identity but now a center
structured according to the capacities for and the principles of
heterogeneous absorption.]{.underline}27 This is the historic period
that tried to perfect the motto \"e pluribus unum\" as a technique of
power, as a strategic situation for the u.s. nation-state, for American
capital, and for the American academy. This perfection, in a moment of
movements and agitations, would inaugurate a new dramatic turn for
modern institutions in the United. States, a shift that entailed a
manifest rather than latent engagement with marginalized differences and
cultures, an engagement that helped to constitute new modes of
regulation and exclusion, modes that simultaneously engaged modern
difference and modern transnationalism. This is how we might interpret
the history of power in response to the radical movements of the
fifties, sixties, seventies, and beyond. It is also how we might
decipher the contemporary history of state, capital, and academy in the
late twentieth century and afterwards.

### 1NC -- Link - Democratic Deliberation

#### While Democratic Deliberation aims to allow everyone equal opportunity to engage in the democratic process. Events prior to deliberation exclude certain voices from debate defeating the purpose of democracy in the first place (best)

**Sanders 97** (Lynn, Contributor to journals including Philosophy of
the Social Sciences, Political Theory, American Journal of Sociology,
and to Divided by Color (with Donald Kinder, 1996)., Against
Deliberation, Sage Publications inc., June 1997)
<http://faculty.virginia.edu/lsanders/SB617_01.pdf> NEW

[Even on this truest, best version, deliberation still provides no
solution for, and possibly exacerbates, the hardest problem for
democrats, and therefore misses by its own standards. American
democratic theorists who want to discourage elitism, expand citizen
participation, improve the ability of citizens to discuss policy
questions, and evaluate political candidates, and before all this,
heighten citizen respect for each other, need to take one problem as
primary. This problem is how more of the people who routinely speak
less\--who, through various mechanisms or accidents of birth and
fortune, are least expressive in and most alienated from conventional
American politics\--might take part and be heard and how those who
typically dominate might be made to attend to the views of others.
Contemporary democratic theorists are, to be sure, aware of the
seriousness of this problem of disenfranchisement.]{.underline} So, for
example, when Cass Sunstein makes the case that the best thing about
republican thought is its commitment to deliberative democracy, he
hastens to point out what's bad about it: [deliberation, he says, cannot
neatly be separated from republican practices of exclusion of women,
Blacks, and those lacking property]{.underline} (Sunstein 1988, 1539).
Bernard Manin argues that deliberation is worth praising because a truly
deliberative process issuing in legitimate political decisions utterly
requires the participation of \"all\" (1987, esp. 352, 359). Knight and
Johnson carefully emphasize the importance of \"free and equal access to
deliberative arenas\" (1994[). Fishkin's recent proposal to revitalize
American democracy through a \"deliberative opinion poll\" makes equal
consideration of everyone's preferences an essential precondition to
democracy (1991, 30). Further, some democratic theorists not only
mention the importance of formal equalization of access but also
advocate structural or economic reforms to guarantee that all citizens
have the resources\--time, money, education, skill at arguing\--required
for deliberation.]{.underline} For instance, Cohen and Rogers (1983)
notice that [\"the absence of material deprivation is a precondition for
free and unconstrained deliberation\"]{.underline} (p. 157) [and that
\"material inequalities can subvert a structure of free and equal public
deliberation by translating into sharply unequal capacities for
political action\" (p. 158). They urge the elimination of gross material
inequities and also recommend free public education and state-financed
child care.]{.underline} Education ensures the development of
deliberative capacities, and child care on this view guarantees that
women can participate in politics after they have learned how to
deliberate by going to school. Johnson and Knight have systematically
addressed these problems and attempted to specify the (formal, not
institutional) nature of the remedies to inequity that must precede
deliberation (1996). These acknowledgements of the prerequisites to
deliberation, and these attempts to instill deliberation with a
participatory and inclusive impulse, are far from trivial. They in fact
must be made if deliberation is to qualify as democratic. Yet they do
not, I think, fully address problems of exclusion, because there is too
great a disjuncture between the hardest problems that democracy's
proponents must grapple with and the formality of the acknowledgments
and recommendations that democratic theorists make. [Some critics have
noticed the manifestation of this disjuncture in the abstract talk of
democratic theorists. Indeed, this abstraction may be absolutely
necessary for proponents of deliberative democracy, because
acknowledgment of the hardest problems, that is, the systematic
disregard of ascriptively defined groups such as women and Blacks, would
violate the deliberative tenet to attend to the force of argument rather
than the interests of particular groups (Phillips 1995, 155 ff.).
Indeed, democratic citizens as described in these theories seem to live
on another planet (quite literally, in the case of Ackerman 1980): they
are devoid of race, class, and gender and all the benefits and
liabilities associated by Americans with these features.]{.underline}
Abstraction from these ascriptive characteristics\--their
disregard\--clearly assists attempts to end discrimination based upon
them; as well, however, abstraction deprives theorists of a way to
notice systematic patterns of exclusion. A deeper, more difficult
problem than abstraction lurks. [Even if democratic theorists notice the
inequities associated with class and race and gender and, for example,
recommend equalizing income and education to redistribute the resources
needed for deliberation\--even if everyone can deliberate and learn how
to give reasons\--some people's ideas may still count more than others.
Insidious prejudices may incline citizens to hear some arguments and not
others. Importantly, this prejudice may be unrecognized by those
citizens whose views are disregarded as well as by other citizens.
Proponents of deliberation are especially badly equipped to address this
problem. They depend on open arguments against prejudice to overcome it,
and on the susceptibility of prejudice to reason. Not only do they
believe in the existence of settings where nothing matters except for an
idea's intellectual force and its communal utility, as in Habermas's
ideal speech situation (Habermas \[1962\] 1992; Calhoun 1992) or in
Ackerman's insistence that a speaker's superiority can never tee invoked
as a reason to prefer an idea(1980, 4, 11); they also expect prejudices
to be challenged in deliberative settings and for others to \"face up\"
to them (Gutmann and Thompson 1996). When disregard based in prejudice
goes unrecognized by both those who are subject to it and those who are
prejudiced, prejudices cannot possibly be challenged. Prejudice and
privilege do not emerge in deliberative settings as bad reasons, and
they are not countered by good arguments. They are too sneaky,
invisible, and pernicious for that reasonable process. So worrying about
specifying what counts as a good argument, or trying to enhance
reason-giving either via the formulation of better rules and procedures
or by providing the time, money, and education necessary to become a
responsible deliberative citizen, does not engage some of the most
serious challenges to the possibility of achieving democratic
deliberation. Some people might be ignored no matter how good their
reasons are, no matter how skillfully they articulate them, and when
this happens, democratic theory doesn't have an answer, because one
cannot counter a pernicious group dynamic with a good reason. Sometimes,
giving reasons isn't anything like the right project and suggesting that
the disregarded argue against prejudice or discrimination is offensive
in and of itself.(4)]{.underline}

I love to argue. A simple five-minute scan of my Facebook page reveals
that I am more than willing to argue the most banal matters into
perpetuity. To me, verbal disputes are the best form of nonviolent
problem solving. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that society
has inculcated me with evolving forms of the belief that "sticks and
stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." This adage has
helped mediate most of my conversations since birth and currently
manifests itself as calls for "civil discourse". In light of recent
viral altercations---Neo-Nazi [Richard Spencer getting punched in the
face](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/white-nationalist-richard-spencer-punched/index.html)
and rioters at [UC Berkeley breaking
windows](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/01/uc-berkeley-campus-protest-milo-yiannopoulos-breitbart/97378104/)
in reaction to Milo Yiannopoulos---I have heard many fellow students
exclaim the need for words over fists and stones. Through Facebook
statuses and classroom discussions, both well-intentioned [liberals and
conservatives are condemning]{.underline} the actions of UC Berkeley
students as [attacks on free speech. They contend that]{.underline}
these a[cts of property damage must be replaced by civil discourse and
an old-fashioned free exchange of ideas]{.underline} in an attempt to
come to a consensus. **[The problem with these cookie-cutter reactions
to rioting is that they often completely ignore the limitations of
"civil discourse" and the tangible violence that words have created in
the United States today]{.underline}**. [Calls for discourse seem to
imply a type of equal power dynamic that is simply not present in our
world today. In a society that gifts disproportionate power to white
men, conversations are not created equally]{.underline}. For example,
when I, a black male, argue the value of the Black Lives Matter movement
with a white male Trump supporter, our conversation does not exist in a
vacuum. It exists, rather, in a framework in which white male Trump
supporters carry enough political power to control every branch of
government while black and brown bodies are constantly being physically
attacked. In a very tangible sense, **[this civil discourse is an
indirect fight for my life. It is a verbal attempt to wrestle power away
from my opponent rather than a free exercise towards an objective truth.
In this context, it is no wonder why some would rather yell, cry, curse,
insult, or dismiss discourse altogether in order to be
heard.]{.underline}** When few opportunities for power are available, it
is unsurprising that "civility" and discourse may be discarded. Civil
rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. understood this when, just three
years after the March on Washington, [he
explained](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mlk-a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard/)
that "the cry of 'black power' is, at bottom, a reaction to the
reluctance of white power to make the kind of changes necessary to make
justice a reality. ... I think that we\'ve got to see that [a riot is
the language of the unheard]{.underline}." In this speech, Martin Luther
King Jr., a staunch supporter of nonviolence, does what many
contemporary critics of rioting are unable to do: He sincerely engages
with the reasoning behind riots. King does not rebuke riots wholesale.
He does not dismiss the rioters by depicting them as illogical and
entitled youth. He does not blame the symptoms for the virus. Instead,
he works to understand their rationale and root their actions in the
inequities present in our political system. This is not to say that
Martin Luther King Jr. was an advocate for rioting, but, rather, that he
was an unflinching advocate for rioters. This is a fundamental
difference between calls for nonviolence then versus what can be seen on
our campus now. Today, many completely dismiss the actions of rioters by
disingenuously quoting Martin Luther King or constructing false
equivalence between those who break windows and those whose words can
kill thousands. [If a broken window incites more national rage than
families broken up by Breitbart-style hypernationalism or]{.underline}

[by Fox News-induced bigotry, then riots will not stop. From the point
of view of a protester, the only opportunity for their voice to be heard
is in the echo of shattering glass.]{.underline} Many would not prefer
this outcome. Had UC Berkeley listened when students attempted to
explain the tangible violence that Milo and Breitbart induce, perhaps
students wouldn't feel the need to resort to "the language of the
unheard." Columbia students shouldn\'t see this as a threat, but as a
lesson on the limitations of discourse. [Maybe if the livelihoods of
people of color meant more than physical property, both could be
preserved. Maybe if society cared more about the rioters than they did
about the rioting, civil discourse could be had]{.underline}.

As Policy Debate grew in popularity, the [more Machiavellian debaters
attempted to gain an edge by overwhelming their opponents with as many
arguments and as much supporting evidence as possible. This was because
if a team "dropped" an argument by its opponent---if it did not respond
to the other side's claim---that argument was conceded as "true," no
matter how inane it was]{.underline}. Chief among the strategies
exploiting this rule was "spreading" (a combination of "speed" and
"reading"), where debaters would rattle off arguments at a blistering
pace. Their speeches often exceeded 300 words per minute. (A
conversational pace is about 60 per minute[.) Debaters started
formulating outlandish arguments. The more apocalyptic the outcome the
better, with little care for the argument's probability or real-world
application.]{.underline} "A new retirement program will trigger a
nuclear war." "Prison overcrowding would cause the destruction of the
ozone layer." High school debate had come to this. If you were to peek
into a room in the middle of a policy round, you would likely be treated
to a flurry of limbs and spittle, as a teenager expelled arguments from
his mouth with such speed and force that he would sometimes appear to
lose control of his fine motor functions. When an executive of Phillips
Petroleum, then the primary sponsor of the National Forensics League,
observed a debate at the 1979 national championship, he found it utterly
incomprehensible. The executive aired his concerns to the league's
executive council, resulting in an entirely new debate category called
the Lincoln-Douglas debate.

interlocutor here will be black- ness: that (non)ontological
constitutive outside of the modern grammar that is relegated to the
realm of absolute necessity, negativity, incapacity, and pathology that
subtends the political and therhetorical. As that which is always
already outside the World/History, blackness provides an anoriginary non
place from which to think crisis and a politics of actualizing the
impossible. Imminent civil war is an interesting but unsurprising
anxiety;it is unsurprising because the U.S. Civil War informs so much of
the popular narrative of the United States and its ethical position that
confirms the progressive nature of time,and because liberal sovereignty
was always a war waged against civilwar.1 And it is interesting because
the Greeks referred to civil war as"stasis."Today standing, state, and

Stasis then doubles both as sovereignty and as sovereignty's undoing and
evokes a constant permanence of war even in peace. Stasis in rhetorical
studies takes on the meaning of "issue" and serves as a hermeneutic for
coming to consensus on the point of contention from which debate
proceeds. Stasis here also means standing in the sense that there is
some "ground" in the form of prior consensus on the nature of the
disagreement.]{.underline} 2 The somewhat paradoxical relationship
between consensus and dissensus found in stasis speaks to a kind of
disavowal of ungroundedness that precedes even the point from which to
begin speaking[. Must one have a presupposed potentiality for a common
ground to be able to proceed in argument?]{.underline} Refusing this
disavowal of groundless- ness as it emerges in contemporary figurations
of agonistic debate might enable us to more accurately think of rhetoric
in its modern inflection as the presupposition of a ground as a war
against its own void via antiblackness. The inversion of Clausewitz's
proposition is salient: [rhetoric is the continuation of war by other
means; rhetoric as a mode of war in an effort to ontologize itself
against its groundless outside]{.underline}.3 The (im)possible is always
at stake in debate since rhetoric regards the contingent as its
necessary presupposition. According to Dilip Gaonkar, Pdf_Folio:64 this
"key, but largely unnoticed, assumption in contemporary rhetorical
theory" finds its basis in the Aristotles response to Platos charge of
the unspecifiablity of rhetoric (2004,5) Instead of freeing us to
reflect explicitly on the nature of contingency Aristotles domestication
of rhetoric by placing rhetoric within the domain of "contingent yet
probable "has promopted most rhetorical scholars to forgo consideration
of contingency in favor of the thematic of probability: doxa,
constraints, norms, ideology. Cotingency in these schemas tends to be
considered as a property ascribed to statements propositions, and
rhetorical acts-to the ontic world that constitutes the context of the
rhetor---rather than as a mode of the subject or the singular encounter
that constitutes a rhetorical situation. The possi bility of rhetorical
dialectic, that exigency that provides the opportunity for agonistic
argument that can be sublated into judgment, animates historical
progress and places debate as the ground for civic life. In the liberal
under standing of contemporary debate, contingency takes on an interior
spatial dimension as the possible content through a disavowal of the
contingency of debates outside that is rendered impossible To say that
debate is impossible is then to beckon to war on the horizon. It is to
recognize the state of emergency as the end of the state of [debate The
historical legacy of the U.S. Civil War will not let us end it there how
ever, because blackness haunts even civil war, and threatens stasis in
both its senses with incoherence. To leave raciality by the wayside is
to repeat the endless disavowal that what we are threatened with is
civil war and not race war. It is to still recuperate this World though
the dialectical resolution that can adjust antagonism to agonism. It is
to wage liberal sovereignty's war.against civil war all over
again.]{.underline} **[Polite discussions that acknowledge racial terror
only so as to explain away racial violence as the unique domain of
extremists maintain a sense of white innocence that not only
individuates a structural condition, but also pathologizes and prohibits
black utterance (especially when that utterance might take on the form
of rage) by adjusting the impossible demands of blackness back to the
acceptable terms of debate]{.underline}**. Within such discussions,
blackness can only appear as an afterthought, as what Denise Ferreira
DaSilva terms the *affectable I* or outer-determined rather than
self-determined subject in the onto-epistemological modern text (da
Silva 2007). Raciality is intrinsic to modernity because it is
necessary. For the construction of the Subject---it names the
materialization of the spatiotemporal forms that make the modern
grammar. It creates the grounds for the self-determined subject. For da
Silva, nothing short of a fracturing of the spatiotemporal formal
principles of understanding that subtend historical and scientific
knowledge will redress the totality of racial violence, especially as it
concerns black folk.

#### Debate that stems from stasis points forecloses black life; only by refusing the call to order are black forms of life in debate opened

**Kelsie'19** (Kelsie, Amber E., Director of Communication Studies, Wake
Forest University, "Blackened Debate at the End of the
World." *Philosophy & Rhetoric*, vol. 52, no. 1, 2019, pp.

[What would it mean to think debate as a praxis of the impossible? To
think a blackened debate not as the presupposition of a ground through
approximation to an antiblack human genre of Man, the Subject or the
transparent I, but as Harney and Moten say, "jurisgenerative black
social life]{.underline} "(2017,15) We would need to rethink the
cherished terms of rhetoric itself. [We might think debate not as
dialectic that both precedes and proceeds from stasis, but as the
refusal of "the call to order "that opens up black forms of life, even
as form is placed under erasure.]{.underline}(Halberstram 2013,9) From
this vantage point of blackness, which is not really a vantage point at
all, but a being out of place and time, of Being under erasure in the
condition of mutual dispossession, we might begin to sketch other
visions that deactivate rhetorics ontoligizing premises, to hold for a
moment, in the hold and the wake, not grounded but oceanic movement
decay and life , where even dead things become something else. [It is
here and hapeening all the time in the marooned spaces of the world. In
studying debates (im)possibility, we might theorize at the End of the

### 1NC -- Link - Trigger Warnings

#### **Trigger Warnings are ineffective as "triggers' are unpredictable, Trigger Warnings promote a fear of words that prevents the engagement of ideas.**

**Jarvie'14**( Jenny Jarvie "Trigger Happy",March 3 2014, The New
Republic,Retrieved From:
https://newrepublic.com/article/116842/trigger-warnings-have-spread-blogs-college-classes-thats-
Acessed July 21 19)

The headline above would, if some readers had their way, include a
\"trigger warning\"---a disclaimer to alert you that this article
contains potentially traumatic subject matter. Such warnings, which are
most commonly applied to discussions about rape, sexual abuse, and
mental illness, have appeared on message boards since the early days of
the Web. Some consider them an irksome tic of the blogosphere's most
hypersensitive fringes, and yet they\'ve spread from feminist forums and
social media to sites as large as the [The Huffington
Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/syrian-rape-and-chemical-_b_2370638.html).
Now, the trigger warning is gaining momentum beyond the Internet---at
some of the nation\'s most prestigious universities. Last week, student
leaders at the University of California, Santa Barbara, passed a
resolution urging officials to institute mandatory trigger warnings on
class syllabi. Professors who present \"content that may trigger the
onset of symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\" would be required
to issue advance alerts and allow students to skip those classes.
According to UCSB newspaper *The Daily Nexus*, Bailey Loverin, the
student who sponsored the
[proposal](https://newrepublic.com/article/116842/%20http://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/resolutions/a-resolution-to-mandate-warnings-for-triggering-content-in-academic-settings),
[decided to push the
issue](http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/a-s-senate-passes-proposal-to-label-trauma-provoking-academic-content/)
after attending a class in which she "felt forced" to sit through a film
that featured an "insinuation" of sexual assault and a graphic depiction
of rape. A victim of sexual abuse, she did not want to remain in the
room, but she feared she would only draw attention to herself by walking
out. On college campuses across the country, a growing number of
students are demanding trigger warnings on class content. Many
instructors are obliging with alerts in handouts and before
presentations, even emailing notes of caution ahead of class. At Scripps
College, lecturers give warnings before presenting a core curriculum
class, the "Histories of the Present: Violence,\" although some
have questioned the value of such alerts when students are still
required to attend class. Oberlin College has published an official
document on triggers,
[advising](http://new.oberlin.edu/office/equity-concerns/sexual-offense-resource-guide/prevention-support-education/support-resources-for-faculty.dot) faculty
members to \"be aware of racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism,
cissexism, ableism, and other issues of privilege and oppression,\" to
remove triggering material when it doesn\'t \"directly\" contribute to
learning goals and \"strongly consider\" developing a policy to make
\"triggering material\" optional. Chinua Achebe\'s *Things Fall Apart*,
it states, is a novel that may \"trigger readers who have experienced
racism, colonialism, religious persecution, violence, suicide and
more.\" Warnings have been proposed even for books long considered
suitable material for high-schoolers: Last month, a Rutgers
University sophomore
[suggested](http://www.dailytargum.com/opinion/columnists/philip_wythe/trigger-warnings-needed-in-classroom/article_cecbf732-9845-11e3-a65e-001a4bcf6878.html) that
an alert for F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s *The Great Gatsby* say, \"TW:
suicide, domestic abuse and graphic violence.\" [What began as a way of
moderating Internet forums for the vulnerable and mentally ill now
threatens to define public discussion both online and off. The trigger
warning signals not only the growing precautionary approach to words and
ideas in the university, but a wider cultural hypersensitivity to harm
and a paranoia about giving offense. And yet, for all the debate about
the warnings on campuses and on the Internet, few are grappling with the
ramifications for society as a whole]{.underline}. Not everyone seems to
agree on what the trigger warning is, let alone how it should be
applied. Initially, trigger warnings were used in self-help and feminist
forums to help readers who might have post traumatic stress disorder to
avoid graphic content that might cause painful memories, flashbacks, or
panic attacks. Some websites, like Bodies Under Siege, a self-injury
support message board, developed systems of adding abbreviated topic
tags---from SI (self injury) to ED (eating disorders)---to particularly
explicit posts. As the Internet grew, warnings became more popular, and
critics began to question their use. In 2010, Susannah Breslin
[wrote](http://trueslant.com/susannahbreslin/2010/04/13/trigger-warning-this-blog-post-may-freak-you-the-f-out/)
in True/Slant that feminists were applying the term \"like a Southern
cook applies Pam cooking spray to an overused nonstick frying
pan\"---prompting Feministing to call her a \"certifiable asshole,\" and
[Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/5516969/trigger+angry-the-politics-of-internet-trigger-warnings)
to lament that the debate has \"been totally clouded by ridiculous
inflammatory rhetoric.\"The term only spread with the advent of social
media. In 2012, The Awl\'s Choire Sicha argued that it had \"[lost all
its
meaning](http://www.theawl.com/2012/05/when-trigger-warning-lost-all-its-meaning).\"
Since then, [alerts have been applied to topics as diverse as

Certain people, from rapper [Chris

to sex columnist [Dan
Savage](http://nextstepcake.tumblr.com/post/49163315150/dan-savage-quotes-from-a-sexual),
have been dubbed "triggering." Some have called for trigger warnings for
television shows such as
\"[Scandal](http://www.xojane.com/entertainment/scandal-mellie-rape)\"
and \"[Downton

The New Republic
has [suggested](https://newrepublic.com/article/113153/onion-satire-chris-brown-rihanna-breakup-misses-mark) the
satirical news site, The Onion, carry trigger warnings]{.underline}. At
the end of last year, Slate declared 2013 the \"Year of the Trigger
Warning," noting that such alerts had become the target of humor.
Jezebel, which does not issue trigger warnings, raised hackles in August
by using the term as a headline joke: \"[It\'s Time To Talk About Bug
Infestations \[TRIGGER
WARNING\]](http://jezebel.com/its-time-to-talk-about-bug-infestations-trigger-warni-977389543).\"
Such usage, one
critic [argued](http://groupthink.jezebel.com/so-is-jez-just-making-fun-of-trigger-warnings-now-1003465242),
amounted to \"trivializing\" such alerts and \"trolling people who
believe in them.\" And in Britain, Suzanne Moore, a feminist columnist
for *The Guardian*, was taken to task when she put a trigger warning on
her Twitter bioline, mocking those who followed her feeds only to claim
offense. Some critics have
[ridiculed](https://twitter.com/_BingCherry/status/294447040845467648)
her in turn: \"Trigger warning, \@Suzanne_moore is talking again.\"
(Moore\'s Twitter bio [now reads](https://twitter.com/suzanne_moore),
\"Media Whore.\")  [The backlash has not stopped the growth of the
trigger warning, and now that they\'ve entered university
classrooms, it\'s only a matter of time before warnings are demanded for
other grade levels. As students introduce them in [college
newspapers](http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2012/10/17/account-sexual-assault-amherst-college),
[promotional material for
plays](http://newspaperarchives.vassar.edu/cgi-bin/vassar?a=d&d=miscellany20121206-01.2.30&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-------),
even [poetry
slams](http://forums.poetryslam.com/index.php?topic=9222.0), it\'s not
inconceivable that they\'ll appear at the beginning of film screenings
and at the entrance to art exhibits. Will newspapers start applying
warnings to articles about rape, murder, and war? Could they even become
a regular feature of speech?]{.underline} \"I was walking down Main
Street last night when---trigger warning---I saw an elderly woman get
mugged.\" The \"Geek Feminism Wiki\"
[states](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Trigger_warning) that
trigger warnings should be used for \"graphic descriptions or extensive
discussion\" of abuse, torture, self-harm, suicide, eating disorders,
body shaming, and even \"psychologically realistic\" depictions of *the
mental state* of people suffering from those; it notes that some have
gone further, arguing for warnings before the \"depiction or discussion
of any consensual sexual activity \[and\] of discriminatory attitudes or
actions, such as sexism or racism.\" The
[definition](http://queerdictionary.tumblr.com/post/3971857194/trigger-warning-content-warning)
on the Queer Dictionary Tumblr is similar, but expands warnings even to
discussion of *statistics* on hate crimes and self-harming.  [As the
list of trigger warning--worthy topics continues to grow, there\'s scant
research demonstrating how words \"trigger\" or how warnings might
help. Most psychological
[research](http://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/ptsd_symptoms.html) on P.T.S.D.
suggests that, for those who have experienced trauma, \"triggers\" can
be complex and unpredictable, appearing in many forms, from sounds to
smells to weather conditions and times of the year. In this sense,
anything can be a trigger---a musky cologne, a ditsy pop song, a
footprint in the snow. ]{.underline} As a means of navigating the
Internet, or setting the tone for academic discussion, the trigger
warning is [unhelpful. Once we start imposing alerts on the basis of
potential trauma, where do we stop? One of the problems with the concept
of triggering---understanding words as devices that activate a mechanism
or cause a situation---is it promotes a rigid, overly deterministic
approach to language. There is no rational basis for applying warnings
because there is no objective measure of words\' potential harm. Of
course, words can inspire intense reactions, but they have no intrinsic
danger. Two people who have endured similarly painful experiences, from
rape to war, can read the same material and respond in wholly different
ways]{.underline}.  Issuing caution on the basis of potential harm or
insult doesn\'t help us negotiate our reactions; it makes our dealings
with others more fraught. As Breslin [pointed
out,](http://trueslant.com/susannahbreslin/2010/04/14/trigger-warnings-dont-work-heres-why/) trigger
warnings can have the opposite of their intended effect, luring in
sensitive people (and perhaps connoisseurs of graphic content, too).
More importantly[, they reinforce the fear of words by depicting an
ever-expanding number of articles and books as dangerous and requiring
of regulation. By framing more public spaces, from the Internet to the
college classroom, as full of infinite yet ill-defined hazards, trigger
warnings encourage us to think of ourselves as more weak and fragile
than we really are.  What\'s more, the fear of triggers risks narrowing
what we\'re exposed to.]{.underline} Raechel Tiffe, an assistant
professor in Communication Arts and Sciences at Merrimack College,
Massachusetts,
[described](http://rebelgrrlacademy.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/pedagogy-of-a-trigger/) a
lesson in which she thought everything had gone well, until a student
approached her about a clip from the television musical comedy,
\"Glee,\" in which a student commits suicide. For Tiffe, who uses
trigger warnings for sexual assault and rape, the incident was a
\"teaching moment\"---not for the students, but for her to be more aware
of the breadth of students\' sensitivities. As academics become more
preoccupied with students' feelings of harm, they risk opening the door
to a never-ending litany of requests. Last month, students
at Wellesley College
[protested](https://newrepublic.com/article/116493/tony-matellis-naked-man-statue-shouldnt-shock-wellesley-students)
a sculpture of a man in his underwear because, according to [the
Change.org
petition](https://www.change.org/petitions/president-h-kim-bottomly-move-the-sleepwalker-inside-the-davis-museum),
it was a source of \"triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault.\"
While the petition acknowledged the sculpture may not disturb everyone
on campus, it insisted we share a "responsibility to pay attention to
and attempt to answer the needs of all of our community members.\" Even
after the artist explained that the figure was supposed to be
sleepwalking, students continued to insist it be moved indoors. [Trigger
warnings are presented as a gesture of empathy, but the irony is they
lead only to more solipsism, an over-preoccupation with one's own
feelings---much to the detriment of society as a whole. Structuring
public life around the most fragile personal sensitivities will only
restrict all of our horizons. Engaging with ideas involves risk, and
slapping warnings on them only undermines the principle of intellectual
exploration. We cannot anticipate every potential trigger---the world,
like the Internet, is too large and unwieldy. But even if we could, why
would we want to? Bending the world to accommodate our personal
frailties does not help us overcome them.]{.underline}

denuding, indeed petrifying scrutiny---and people? At the same time, as
fraught as research is in its complicity with power, it is one of the
last places for legitimated inquiry. It is at least still a space that

not just as a "no," but as a type of investigation into "what you need
to know and what I refuse to write in" (Simpson, 2007, p. 72).

### 1NC -- Link -- Post-Modernism 

#### Post Modernism in Debate means that debate becomes focused on the satisfaction of the individual and not enlightenment

**Scwartzman'2k**( Schwartzman, Roy. 2000 \"Postmodernism and the
Practice of Debate.\" Rostrum 75 (2000): 1-8.)

Far from presenting means to escape repressive social practices,
[postmodernism could fuel the very repression it
criticizes.]{.underline} **[By negating the role of public deliberation,
postmodernism replaces rationality with will power as the means for
deciding contro- versy]{.underline}**. Explaining the postmodern aspects
of *Jurassic Park*, Goodnight (1995) ob- serves that \"it is will, not
reason, that con- firms genius in the postmodern moment\" (p. 275). [In
debate rounds, therefore, intel- lectual acumen would not reap rewards
un- der a postmodern view. Instead, the ability to impose one\'s will on
another, be that through persuasion or physical force, would merit
praise.]{.underline} Lest this conclusion seem far- fetched, recall that
within a postmodern framework there are no *a priori* preferences for
persuasion over coercion. From a postmodern perspective, there is no
\"unique value to \'rational\' as opposed to other forms of
justification\" such as force (Harris & Rowland, 1993, p. 31).
Postmodern heroes, for example, are not necessarily technical experts,
but they do know how to manipu- late the resources at hand (Goodnight,
1995). [Is this the primary lesson debaters should learn from the
activity? Unbridled argumentative inclusive- ness also invites abuses.
Some viewpoints, such as fascism, have been marginalized in order to
encourage participation]{.underline}. I submit, with Hirst (1993), that
[certain practices such as blatant intolerance, racism, sexism, and
homophobia have no justification and de- serve no place in
argumentation. Such means of \"arguing\" should be marginalized. Without
some criteria for distinguishing jus- tifiable versus unjustifiable
marginalization, blatantly abusive behavior in debate rounds could be
tolerated or even promoted in the name of free expression. Not all
\"oth- erness\" qualifies as virtue (Bernstein, 1991). Designation as an
oppressed group does not constitute a prima facie case for status as
righteous but unfairly persecuted. The fundamental problem in apply- ing
postmodernism to debate is that postmodernism functions best as a
critical tool, not as an evaluative method or a set of adjudicative
standards.]{.underline} It is designed to expose and question
unquestioned assump- tions. The supposedly radical break postmodernism
makes with previous epis- temological practice makes it unsuitable for
use in an activity such as academic debate, which is thoroughly
modernist in its prac- tices, especially if viewed as advocacy of truth
or as discovering which side does the better arguing[. Debate in general
qualifies as a \"traditional (modernist) mode]{.underline}\" (Zavarzadeh
& Morton, 1991, p. 120) of con- testing ideas, to be contrasted with the
postmodern accommodation of differences and tolerance of unresolved
(thereby unresolvable?) disputes. The avowal of in- consistency,
therefore, reverberates be- yond academic debate. Once inconsistency is
institutionalized, it dissolves the desir- ability and perhaps even the
possibility of converging viewpoints and stable social relationships.
The postmodern praise of contradiction \"underlines the insurmount- able
differences that make for a lack of so- cial and personal cohesion\"
(Kuspit, 1990, p. 59). In an activity that could use greater emphasis on
cooperation, why should de- bate theory undermine unity by underlin- ing
heterology? [Debaters, critics, and coaches must ask themselves whether
re- jecting the basis of communal values serves an educational purpose.
It seems far more productive to balance practices that foster community
with a respect for diversity. Why further isolate members of the debate
com- munity from one another by enshrining in- consistency?]{.underline}
The thoroughly modernist activity of debate is structured according to a
division of ground informed by Aristotelian logic. Most prominently, the
distinction between affirmative and negative sides presumes incompatible
positions as the basis for forced choice that leads to a decision. De-
bate actually emphasizes argumentative in- compatibility in order to
facilitate choice. The intolerance of inconsistency is logically and
procedurally necessary in a zero-sum game atmosphere where decisions
must be rendered for one side only. If inconsistency were encouraged as
a component of a postmodern perspective, then counterplans need not be
competitive. In addition, the more inconsistency is tolerated, the
*less* rea- son there would be to vote for postmodernism as an
alternative to the ra- tional methods employed by the opposing team. As
inconsistency becomes more ac- ceptable, it undermines the grounds for
claiming that any argument could qualify as a voting issue. Ultimately,
[if inconsis- tency is desirable, then any particular de- bate could and
should end in a tie. Postmodernism offers debate prima- rily negations:
opposition to unitary evalu- ative standards and rejection of scientifi-
cally based means of adjudication]{.underline}. From a postmodern
perspective, any attempt to place facts \"within some larger, more ambi-
tious explanatory paradigm\--is ignoring the weight of *de facto*
evidence\" that shows the historical failure of grand explanatory
schemes (Norris, 1990, p. 7). If a postmodern perspective could be
applied to debate, it would not take the form of a paradigm or other
normative structure. Postmodernism might simply counsel us to recognize
our interpretations as limited, thus enabling political engagement
without hegemonic claims to know an ultimate Truth (Marshall, 1992).
Such self-imposed restrictions on the scope of claims would introduce a
welcome tone of modesty into competitive debates. The choice is not
whether or not to \"adopt\" a postmodern perspective, but to decide how
postmodern conditions could affect the assumptions and conduct of de-
bate. Postmodernists along the lines o Baudrillard discard the
qualification that contradictions should not be obvious and they embrace
paradox instead. In contract to Rorty, Baudrillard recommends:
\"Distrust campaigns of solidarity at every level,\" be- cause all sense
of unity and permanence is designed to disguise the erosion of
referentiality (1983, p. 110n). This strain of postmodernism abandons
criteria for valid argumentation, instead judging argumenta- tive
quality on the aesthetic merits of the rhetorical strategy irrespective
of normative standards (Norris, 1990). [The raison d\'etre of debate
would become the satisfaction of individual taste, since aesthetics no
longer would have any transcendent grounding in human values or fidelity
to anything beyond the representation itself. Such a change harbors
serious implications. Argumenta- tive acumen reduces to knowing how to
best one\'s opponents, so the hope that argumen- tation can enlighten
arguers and audiences vanishes because enlightenment is
illusory.]{.underline} The political consequences of postmodern debate
do not sound enticing, either. The promise of argumentation serv- ing as
an intellectually and socially liberat- ing force\--an agenda adopted by
Habermas, for example\--relies on rationally grounded critique that
exposes distortion and inter- nal contradiction. Without an understand-
ing of what would constitute argumenta- tive progress or communicative
value, postmodernism fails to offer grounds or ex- planations of change.
In essence, postmodernism sounds the call for political involvement
while leaving a blank slate when called upon to produce a vision of
productive social engagement for intellec- tuals (McGowan, 1991). These
considerations leave at least two choices for those involved with aca-
demic debate. First, debaters and critics can adopt a postmodern mindset
but at the cost of undermining procedural foundations and social
relevance. Harris and Rowland (1993) note that academic debate already
exhibits some postmodern tendencies, such as the detachment from
analogues and applica- tions beyond the rounds themselves. The
independence of debaters from \"real world\" concerns such as face
validity of arguments brings debate ever closer to Baudrillard\'s
simulacra, where external reference dis- solves. In a word, academic
debate becomes more postmodern the more it grows irrel- evant to the
world beyond the round. On the other hand, the practice of debate might
be understood as antagonistic to postmodern tendencies. In policy de-
bate, how could argumentation have any significance once the
relationship between intellectuals and social change becomes ill-
defined and idiosyncratic? In value debate, how could values be weighed
when the standards for evaluating them have evapo- rated? In any form of
debate, how could decisions be rendered when the very crite- ria for
making those decisions no longer stand? Recognizing the influence of
postmodernism still can allow for some ex- planation of how agreement
could be reached and how decisions could be justi- fied without
appealing to universal, immu- table standards. This task is akin to the
project Rorty has undertaken since writing *Philosophy and the Mirror of
Nature*. At the core of postmodern thought lies a con- cern for
relationships instead of facts or rep- resentations of reality
(Klinkowitz, 1988, p. 8). Such a shift in orientation drives Rorty
(1979) to reject the epistemological goal of accurately representing
nature. Instead, he envisions epistemology as a continuing conversation
in which claims are posited, tested, and revised consensually. Worthy as
the goal may be, Rorty and others have yet to explore in detail the
means for engi- neering consent and achieving community. Rorty (1991, p.
174) criticizes Lyotard and Foucault for engaging in penetrating social
critiques without articulating the basis for the \"we\" of human
solidarity. Debate theo- rists can take up the same challenge: to elu-
cidate the symbolic and other means for solidarity that permit rational
decision-mak- ing. I avoid using the term *Kritik* in the context of
postmodernism. [As employed in debate rounds, a Kritik represents a com-
prehensive decision-making framework that offers sufficient conditions
for reaching a decision. Since postmodernism cultivates a distrust of
such universal frameworks, the idea of a Kritik could apply only to the
in- dividual round, thereby denying its univer- sality. Kant envisioned
the Kritik as apply- ing to \"the faculty of reason in general,\" not
only extending beyond specific in- stances but \"independently of all
experi- ence\" (Kant, 1965, p. 9).]{.underline}

#### Self defense outside political

**Moten & Harney, 13** (Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, "The

In Michael Parenti's classic anti-imperial analysis of Hollywood movies,
he points to the 'upside down' way that the 'make-believe media'
portrays colonial settlement. In flms like Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)
or Shaka Zulu (1987), the settler is portrayed as surrounded by
'natives,' inverting, in Parenti's view, the role of aggressor so that
colonialism is made to look like self-defense. Indeed, aggression and
self-defense are reversed in these movies, but the image of a surrounded
fort is not false. Instead, the false image is what emerges when a
critique of militarised life is predicated on the forgetting of the life
that surrounds it. Te fort really was surrounded, is besieged by what
still surrounds it, the common beyond and beneath -- before and before
-- enclosure. [The surround antagonises the laager in its midst while
disturbing that facts on the ground with some outlaw planning**. Our
task is the self-defense of the surround in the face of repeated,
targeted dispossessions through the settler's armed
incursion.**]{.underline} **[And while acquisitive violence occasions
this self-defense, it is recourse to self-possession in the face of
dispossession (recourse, in other words, to politics) that represents
the real danger. Politics is an ongoing attack on the common -- the
general and generative antagonism -- from within the surround. Consider
the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, first theorists of the
revolution of the surround, the black before and before, the already and
the forthcoming. Their twinned commitment to revolution and self-defense
emerged from the recognition that the preservation of black social life
is articulated in and with the violence of innovation.]{.underline}**
This is not a contradiction if [the new thing, always calling for
itself, already lives around and below the forts, the police stations,
the patrolled highways and the prison towers.]{.underline} **[The
Panthers theorized revolution without politics, which is to say
revolution with neither a subject nor a principle of
decision.]{.underline}** Against the law because they were generating
law, [they practiced an ongoing planning to be possessed, hopelessly and
optimistically and incessantly indebted, given to unfinished,
contrapuntal study of, and in, the common wealth, poverty and the
blackness of the surround.]{.underline} **[The self-defense of
revolution is confronted not only by the brutalities but also by the
false image of enclosure. The hard materiality of the unreal convinces
us that we are surrounded, that we must take possession of ourselves,
correct ourselves, remain in the emergency, on a permanent footing,
settled, determined, protecting nothing but an illusory right to what we
do not have, which the settler takes for and as the
commons]{.underline}**. But in the moment of right/s the commons is
already gone in the movement to and of the common that surrounds it and
its enclosure. What's left is politics but **[even the politics of the
commons, of the resistance to enclosure, can only be a politics of ends,
a rectitude aimed at the regulatory end of the common]{.underline}**.
**[And even when the election that was won turns out to have been lost,
and the bomb detonates and/or fails to detonate, the common perseveres
as if a kind of elsewhere, here, around, on the ground, surrounding
hallucinogenic facts. Meanwhile, politics soldiers on, claiming to
defend what it has not enclosed, enclosing what it cannot defend but
only endanger.]{.underline}**

#### The Academicization of critical theory harms praxis

**[The settler, having settled for politics, arms himself in the name of
civilisation while critique initiates the self-defense of those of us
who see hostility in the civil union of settlement and
enclosure]{.underline}**. **[We say, rightly, if our critical eyes are
sharp enough, that it's evil and uncool to have a place in the sun in
the dirty thinness of this atmosphere; that house the sheriff was
building is in the heart of a fallout zone. And if our eyes carry
sharpness farther out we trail the police so we can put them on
trial.]{.underline}** [Having looked for politics in order to avoid it,
we move next to each other, so we can be beside ourselves, because we
like the nightlife which ain't no good life.]{.underline} **[Critique
lets us know that politics is radioactive, but politics is the radiation
of critique]{.underline}**. **[So it matters how long we have to do it,
how long we have to be exposed to the lethal efects of its anti-social
energy]{.underline}**. [**Critique endangers the sociality it is
supposed to defend,** not because it might turn inward to damage
politics but]{.underline} **[because it would turn to politics and then
turn outward, from the fort to the surround,]{.underline}** were it not
for preservation, which is given in celebration of what we defend, the
sociopoetic force we wrap tightly round us, since we are poor. **[Taking
down our critique, our own positions, our fortifcations, is self-defense
alloyed with self-preservation. Tat takedown comes in movement, as a
shawl, the armor of fight]{.underline}**. We run looking for a weapon
and keep running looking to drop it. And we can drop it, because however
armed, however hard, the enemy we face is also illusory. **[Uncut
devotion to the critique of this illusion makes us delusional. In the
trick of politics we are insufcient, scarce, waiting in pockets of
resistance, in stairwells, in alleys, in vain]{.underline}**. **[The
false image and its critique threaten the common with democracy, which
is only ever to come, so that one day, which is only never to come, we
will be more than what we are.]{.underline}** But we already are. We're
already here, moving. We've been around. [**We're more than politics,
more than settled, more than democratic. We surround democracy's false
image in order to unsettle it.** Every time it tries to enclose us in a
decision, we're undecided. Every time it tries to represent our will,
we're unwilling. Every time it tries to take root, we're gone (because
we're already here, moving).]{.underline} **[We ask and we tell and we
cast the spell that we are under, which tells us what to do and how we
shall be moved, here, where we dance the war of apposition. We're in a
trance that's under and around us. We move through it and it moves with
us,]{.underline}** out beyond the settlements, out beyond the
redevelopment, where black night is falling, where we hate to be alone,
back inside to sleep till morning, drink till morning, plan till
morning, as the common embrace, right inside, and around, in the
surround. In the clear, critical light of day, **[illusory
administrators whisper of our need for institutions, and all
institutions are political, and all politics is correctional, so it
seems we need correctional institutions in the common, settling it,
correcting us]{.underline}**. But we won't stand corrected. Moreover,
incorrect as we are there's nothing wrong with us. **[We don't want to
be correct and we won't be corrected.]{.underline}** Politics proposes
to make us better, but we were good already in the mutual debt that can
never be made good. **[We owe it to each other to falsify the
institution, to make politics incorrect, to give the lie to our own
determination. We owe each other the indeterminate. We owe each other
everything.]{.underline}** **[An abdication of political responsibility?
OK. Whatever. We're just anti-politically romantic about actually
existing social life. We aren't responsible for politics. We are the
general antagonism to politics looming outside every attempt to
politicise, every imposition of selfgovernance, every sovereign decision
and its degraded miniature, every emergent state and home sweet
home.]{.underline}** **[We are disruption and consent to disruption. We
preserve upheaval. Sent to fuffill by abolishing, to renew by
unsettling, to open the enclosure whose immeasurable venality is
inversely proportionate to its actual area, we got politics surrounded.
We cannot represent ourselves. We can't be represented]{.underline}**.

#### The university depends on the labor of its professors. It depends on these professors to teach, simply placing knowledge in the minds of the students, moving along, and "paying the bills." But the universities need for labor opens up the opportunity for criminality and fugitivity; we must take this opportunity, invading the position of the teacher and using the organization of teaching to steal from the university.

**["To the university I'll steal, and there I'll steal,"]{.underline}**
to borrow from Pistol at the end of Henry V, as he would surely borrow
from us. **[This is the only possible relationship to the American
university today]{.underline}**. This may be true of universities
everywhere. It may have to be true of the university in general. But
certainly, this much is true in the United States: [it cannot be denied
that the university is a place of refuge, and it cannot be accepted that
the university is a place of enlightenment]{.underline}. **[In the face
of these conditions one can only sneak into the university and steal
what one can. To abuse its hospitality, to spite its mission, to join
its refugee colony, its gypsy encampment, to be in but not of -- this is
the path of the subversive intellectual in the modern
university.]{.underline}** [Worry about the university. This is the
injunction today in the United States, one with a long
history.]{.underline} Call for its restoration like Harold Bloom or
Stanley Fish or Gerald Graf. Call for its reform like Derek Bok or Bill
Readings or Cary Nelson. [Call out to it as it calls to
you.]{.underline} But [for the subversive intellectual, all of this goes
on upstairs, in polite company, among the rational men.]{.underline}
[After all, **the subversive intellectual came under false pretenses**,
with bad documents, out of love]{.underline}. **[Her labor is as
necessary as it is unwelcome. The university needs what she bears but
cannot bear what she brings]{.underline}**. And on top of all that, she
disappears. [She disappears into the underground, the downlow lowdown
maroon community of the university, **into the undercommons of
enlightenment, where the work gets done, where the work gets subverted,
where the revolution is still black, still strong.**]{.underline} What
is that work and what is its social capacity for both reproducing the
university and producing fugitivity? If one were to say teaching, one
would be performing the work of the university. **[Teaching is merely a
profession and an operation of that onto-/auto-encyclopedic circle of
the state" that Jacques Derrida calls the Universitas. But it is useful
to invoke this operation to glimpse the hole in the fence where labor
enters, to glimpse its hiring hall, its night quarters]{.underline}**.
**[The university needs teaching labor,]{.underline}** despite itself,
or as itself, self-identical with and thereby erased by it. **[It is not
teaching that holds this social capacity, but something that produces
the not visible other side of teaching, a thinking through the skin of
teaching toward a collective orientation to the knowledge object as
future project, and a commitment to what we want to call the prophetic
organization. But it is teaching that brings us in]{.underline}**.
Before there are grants, research, conferences, books, and journals
there is the experience of being taught and of teaching. Before the
research post with no teaching, before the graduate students to mark the
exams, before the string of sabbaticals, before the permanent reduction
in teaching load, the appointment to run the Center, the consignment of
pedagogy to a discipline called education, before the course designed to
be a new book, teaching happened. [T**he moment of teaching for food is
therefore often mistakenly taken to be a stage, as if eventually one
should not teach for food. If the stage persists, there is a social
pathology in the university. But if the teaching is successfully passed
on, the stage is surpassed, and teaching is consigned to those who are
known to remain in the stage, the sociopathological labor of the
university**. Kant interestingly calls such a stage "self-incurred
minority."]{.underline} He tries to contrast it with having the
"determination and courage to use one's intelligence without being
guided by another." "Have the courage to use your own intelligence."
[But what would it mean if teaching or rather what we might call "the
beyond of teaching" is precisely what one is asked to get beyond, to
stop taking sustenance? **And what of those minorities who refuse, the
tribe of moles who will not come back from beyond (that which is beyond
"the beyond of teaching"), as if they will not be subjects, as if they
want to think as objects, as minority? Certainly, the perfect subjects
of communication, those successfully beyond teaching, will see them as
waste.** But their collective labor will always call into question who
truly is taking the orders of the enlightenment.]{.underline} The waste
lives for those moments beyond teaching when you give away the
unexpected beautiful phrase -- unexpected, no one has asked, beautiful,
it will never come back. Is being the biopower of the enlightenment
truly better than this? Perhaps the biopower of the enlightenment knows
this, or perhaps it is just reacting to the objecthood of this labor as
it must. [**But even as it depends on these moles, these refugees, it
will call them uncollegial, impractical, naive, unprofessional.** And
one may be given one last chance to be pragmatic -- why steal when one
can have it all, they will ask]{.underline}. **[But if one hides from
this interpellation, neither agrees nor disagrees but goes with hands
full into the underground of the university, into the Undercommons --
this will be regarded as theft, as a criminal act.]{.underline}** **[And
it is at the same time, the only possible act]{.underline}**. In that
undercommons of the university one can see that it is not a matter of
teaching versus research or even the beyond of teaching versus the
individualisation of research. **[To enter this space is to inhabit the
ruptural and enraptured disclosure of the commons that fugitive
enlightenment enacts, the criminal, matricidal, queer, in the cistern,
on the stroll of the stolen life, the life stolen by enlightenment and
stolen back, where the commons give refuge, where the refuge gives
commons. What the beyond of teaching is really about is not fnishing
oneself, not passing, not completing;]{.underline}** [it's about
allowing subjectivity to be unlawfully overcome by others, a radical
passion and passivity such that one becomes unft for subjection, because
one does not possess the kind of agency that can hold the regulatory
forces of subjecthood, and one cannot initiate the auto-interpellative
torque that biopower subjection requires and rewards.]{.underline} **[It
is not so much the teaching as it is the prophecy in the organization of
the act of teaching]{.underline}**. [The prophecy that predicts its own
organization and has therefore passed, as commons, and the prophecy that
exceeds its own organization and therefore as yet can only be
organized.]{.underline} Against the prophetic organization of the
undercommons is arrayed its own deadening labor for the university, and
beyond that, the negligence of professionalization, and the
professionalization of the critical academic. [The undercommons is
therefore always an unsafe neighborhood]{.underline}. As Fredric Jameson
reminds us, the university depends upon **["Enlightenment-type critiques
and demystifcation ofs belief and committed ideology, in order to clear
the ground for unobstructed planning and 'development.'" Tis is the
weakness of the university, the lapse in its homeland security. It needs
labor power for this "enlightenmenttype critique," but, somehow, labor
always escapes.]{.underline}** Te premature subjects of the undercommons
took the call seriously, or had to be serious about the call. Tey were
not clear about planning, too mystical, too full of belief. And yet this
labor force cannot reproduce itself, it must be reproduced. **[Te
university works for the day when it will be able to rid itself, like
capital in general, of the trouble of labor]{.underline}**. [It will
then be able to reproduce a labor force that understands itself as not
only unnecessary but dangerous to the development of
capitalism.]{.underline} **[Much pedagogy and scholarship is already
dedicated in this direction. Students must come to see themselves as the
problem, which, counter to the complaints of restorationist critics of
the university, is precisely what it means to be a customer, to take on
the burden of realisation and always necessarily be inadequate to
it.]{.underline}** **[Later, these students will be able to see
themselves properly as obstacles to society, or perhaps, with lifelong
learning, students will return having successfully diagnosed themselves
as the problem.]{.underline}** Still, the dream of an undiferentiated
labor that knows itself as superfuous is interrupted precisely by the
labor of clearing away the burning roadblocks of ideology. While it is
better that this police function be in the hands of the few, it still
raises labor as diference, labor as the development of other labor, and
therefore labor as a source of wealth. [And although the
enlightenment-type critique, as we suggest below, informs on, kisses the
cheek of, any autonomous development as a result of this diference in
labor, there is a break in the wall here, a shallow place in the river,
a place to land under the rocks. **Te university still needs this
clandestine labor to prepare this undiferentiated labor force, whose
increasing specialisation and managerialist tendencies, again contra the
restorationists, represent precisely the successful integration of the
division of labor with the universe of exchange that commands
restorationist loyalty.**]{.underline} **[Introducing this labor upon
labor, and providing the space for its development, creates
risks]{.underline}**. [Like the colonial police force recruited
unwittingly from guerrilla neighborhoods, university labor may harbor
refugees, fugitives, renegades, and castaways]{.underline}. But there
are good reasons for the university to be confdent that such elements
will be exposed or forced underground. Precautions have been taken, book
lists have been drawn up, teaching observations conducted, invitations
to contribute made. **[Yet against these precautions stands the
immanence of transcendence, the necessary deregulation and the
possibilities of criminality and fugitivity that labor upon labor
requires. Maroon communities of composition teachers, mentorless
graduate students, adjunct Marxist historians, out or queer management
professors, state college ethnic studies departments, closed-down flm
programs, visaexpired Yemeni student newspaper editors, historically
black college sociologists, and feminist engineers. And what will the
university say of them? It will say they are unprofessional. Tis is not
an arbitrary charge. It is the charge against the more than
professional. How do those who exceed the profession, who exceed and by
exceeding escape, how do those maroons problematize themselves,
problematize the university, force the university to consider them a
problem, a danger? Te undercommons is not, in short, the kind of
fanciful communities of whimsy invoked by Bill Readings at the end of
his book. The undercommons, its maroons, are always at war, always in
hiding.]{.underline}**

#### Professionalization bad -- critical education is in cahoots with professionalization. Professionalization only attacks the things that it can see, and we therefore must neglect professionalization, rather turning to the study of the undercommons.

But surely if one can write something on the surface of the university,
if one can write for instance in the university about singularities --
those events that refuse either the abstract or individual category of
the bourgeois subject -- one cannot say that there is no space in the
university itself? Surely there is some space here for a theory, a
conference, a book, a school of thought? Surely the university also
makes thought possible? Is not the purpose of the university as
Universitas, as liberal arts, to make the commons, make the public, make
the nation of democratic citizenry? Is it not therefore important to
protect this Universitas, whatever its impurities, from
professionalization in the university? But we would ask what is already
not possible in this talk in the hallways, among the buildings, in rooms
of the university about possibility? How is the thought of the outside,
as Gayatri Spivak means it, already not possible in this complaint?
[**Te maroons know something about possibility. Tey are the condition of
possibility of the production of knowledge in the university -- the
singularities against the writers of singularity, the writers who write,
publish, travel, and speak. It is not merely a matter of the secret
labor upon which such space is lifted, though of course such space is
lifted from collective labor and by it. It is rather that to be a
critical academic in the university is to be against the university, and
to be against the university is always to recognize it and be recognized
by it, and to institute the negligence of that internal outside, that
unassimilated underground, a negligence of it that is precisely, we must
insist, the basis of the professions**. And this act of being against
always already excludes the unrecognized modes of politics, the beyond
of politics already in motion, the discredited criminal
para-organization, what Robin Kelley might refer to as the
infrapolitical feld (and its music**). It is not just the labor of the
maroons but their prophetic organization that is negated by the idea of
intellectual space in an organization called the
university.**]{.underline} [Tis is why the negligence of the critical
academic is always at the same time an assertion of bourgeois
individualism.]{.underline} **[Such negligence is the essence of
professionalization where it turns out professionalization is not the
opposite of negligence but its mode of politics in the United States. It
takes the form of a choice that excludes the prophetic organization of
the undercommons -- to be against, to put into question the knowledge
object, let us say in this case the university, not so much without
touching its foundation, as without touching one's own condition of
possibility, without admitting the Undercommons and being admitted to
it.]{.underline}** [**From this, a general negligence of condition is
the only coherent position.** Not so much an antifoundationalism or
foundationalism, as both are used against each other to avoid contact
with the undercommons. Tis always-negligent act is what leads us to say
there is no distinction between the university in the United States and
professionalization. Tere is no point in trying to hold out the
university against its professionalization. Tey are the same. **Yet the
maroons refuse to refuse professionalization, that is, to be against the
university. Te university will not recognize this
indecision,**]{.underline} **[and thus professionalization is shaped
precisely by what it cannot acknowledge, its internal antagonism, its
wayward labor, its surplus. Against this wayward labor it sends the
critical, sends its claim that what is left beyond the critical is
waste. But in fact, critical education only attempts to perfect
professional education.]{.underline}** **[The professions constitute
themselves in an opposition to the unregulated and the ignorant without
acknowledging the unregulated, ignorant, unprofessional labor that goes
on not opposite them but within them.]{.underline}** [But if
professional education ever slips in its labor, ever reveals its
condition of possibility to the professions it supports and
reconstitutes, critical education is there to pick it up, and to tell
it, never mind -- it was just a bad dream, the ravings, the drawings of
the mad.]{.underline} Because **[critical education is precisely there
to tell professional education to rethink its relationship to its
opposite -- by which critical education means both itself and the
unregulated, against which professional education is
deployed]{.underline}**. [In other words, critical education arrives to
support any faltering negligence, to be vigilant in its negligence, to
be critically engaged in its negligence.]{.underline} [**It is more than
an ally of professional education, it is its attempted completion**. A
professional education has become a critical education. But one should
not applaud this fact. It should be taken for what it is, not progress
in the professional schools, not cohabitation with the Universitas, but
counterinsurgency, the refounding terrorism of law, coming for the
discredited, coming for those who refuse to write of or write up the
undercommons]{.underline}. Te Universitas is always a state/State
strategy. Perhaps it's surprising to say [**professionalization -- that
which reproduces the professions -- is a state strategy**. Certainly,
critical academic professionals tend to be regarded today as harmless
intellectuals, malleable, perhaps capable of some modest intervention in
the so-called public sphere]{.underline}. But to see how this
underestimates the presence of the state we can turn to a bad reading of
Derrida's consideration of Hegel's 1822 report to the Prussian Minister
of Education. Derrida notices the way that Hegel rivals the state in his
ambition for education, wanting to put into place a progressive pedagogy
of philosophy designed to support Hegel's worldview, to unfold as
encyclopedic. [Tis ambition both mirrors the state's ambition, because
it, too, wants to control education and to impose a
worldview,]{.underline} and threatens it, because Hegel's State exceeds
and thus localises the Prussian state, exposing its pretense to the
encyclopedic. Derrida draws the following lesson from his reading:
**[the Universitas]{.underline}**, [as he generalizes the university
(but specifes it, too, as properly intellectual and not
professional),]{.underline} **[always has the impulse of State, or
enlightenment, and the impulse of state, or its specifc conditions of
production and reproduction. Both have the ambition to be, as Derrida
says, onto- and auto-encyclopedic. It follows that to be either for the
Universitas or against it presents problems. To be for the Universitas
is to support this onto- and auto-encyclopedic project of the State as
enlightenment, or enlightenment as totality, to use an old-fashioned
word. To be too much against the Universitas, however, creates the
danger of specifc elements in the state taking steps to rid itself of
the contradiction of the onto- and auto-encyclopedic project of the
Universitas and replacing it with some other form of social
reproduction, the anti-enlightenment -- the position, for instance, of
New Labour in Britain and of the states of New York and California with
their "teaching institutions.]{.underline}**" But a bad reading of
Derrida will also yield our question again: what is lost in this
undecidability? What is the price of refusing to be either for the
Universitas or for professionalization, to be critical of both, and who
pays that price? Who makes it possible to reach the aporia of this
reading? Who works in the premature excess of totality, in the not
not-ready of negligence? [**Te mode of professionalization that is the
American university is precisely dedicated to promoting this consensual
choice: an antifoundational critique of the University or a foundational
critique of the university. Taken as choices, or hedged as bets, one
tempered with the other, they are nonetheless always negligent.
Professionalization is built on this choice.** It rolls out into ethics
and efciency, responsibility and science, and numerous other choices,
**all built upon the theft, the conquest, the negligence of the outcast
mass intellectuality of the undercommons. It is therefore unwise to
think of professionalization as a narrowing and better to think of it as
a circling, an encircling of war wagons around the last camp of
indigenous women and children.** Tink about the way the American doctor
or lawyer regard themselves as educated, enclosed in the circle of the
state's encyclopedia, though they may know nothing of philosophy or
history]{.underline}. What would be outside this act of the conquest
circle**[, what kind of ghostly labored world escapes in the circling
act, an act like a kind of broken phenomenology where the brackets never
come back of and what is experienced as knowledge is the absolute
horizon of knowledge whose name is banned by the banishment of the
absolute]{.underline}**. It is simply a horizon that does not bother to
make itself possible. No wonder that whatever their origins or
possibilities, it is theories of pragmatism in the United States and
critical realism in Britain that command the loyalty of critical
intellectuals**[. Never having to confront the foundation, never having
to confront antifoundation out of faith in the unconfrontable
foundation, critical intellectuals can foat in the middle range. Tese
loyalties banish dialectics with its inconvenient interest in pushing
the material and abstract, the table and its brain, as far as it can,

#### Difference is not liberatory the state is able to neutralize it and incorporate it into the new multicultural academy

cluster at UIC, The Reorder of Things: The University and Its Pedagogies
of Minority Difference, Univ Of Minnesota Press, November 7, 2012)

[A theorization of contradiction also means developing a critical
awareness of the potential vulnerabilities that accompany all
deployments of difference. One such vulnerability arises from the
historic deployment of difference for the purpose of social recognition.
The roots of this deployment lie in revolutionary and cultural
nationalism]{.underline}. Indeed, several thinkers have pointed to this
aspect of minority nationalisms. In her essay \"Black Nationalism and
Black Common Sense,\" for instance, cultural critic Wahneema Lubiano
addresses this particular feature within black nationalist movements.
[As \"Black nationalism \[resisted\] racialized domination for all
classes of the group,\" she argues, \"it has also historically appealed
to the white bourgeois state\" as protector and liberator of black
communities. Moreover, while black nationalism has rebelled against
state imperatives, it has also \"\[reinscribed\] the state in particular
places within its own narratives. \"46 In the context of anticolonial
movements, Lisa Lowe and David Lloyd capture this feature by arguing
that \"the ends of anticolonial nationalism are defined by the goal of
the capture of the state, and its ideology is in large part structured
in terms of liberal discourses and for liberal state institutions.\"47
As such, anticolonial nationalism \"speaks of rights and the citizen, of
equality, fraternity and liberty, makes its claims to self-determination
on the basis of enlightenment universality, and asserts the cultural if
not]{.underline} [economic and military equivalence of its nation-people
to that of the imperial power.]{.underline} \"48 In the racialized
contexts of the U.S. women\'s movement, Norma Alarc6n captures this
contradiction between an insurgent articulation, on the one hand, and
its recognition through dominant ideologies, on the other: \"\[The\]
most popular subject of Anglo-American feminism is an autonomous,
self-making, self-determining subject who first proceeds according to
the logic of identification with regard to the subject of consciousness,
a notion usually viewed as the purview of man, but now claimed for
women. \"49 [All of these writers identify various modes by which
minoritized cultures and differences are put in the service of
recognition and legitimacy: for Lubiano, the state is ironically lifted
as the representative and recognizer of minoritized subjects; for Lowe
and Lloyd, minoritized cultures and differences exhibit elements that
are consistent with rather than antagonistic to liberal state
institutions and the developmental discourses of modernity; for Alarc6n,
minoritized subjects begin to identify with and reinscribe themselves as
rational subjects and thus invoke and endorse those properties
archetypically associated with Western man. Lubiano, Lowe, Lloyd, and
Alarc6n point to a hard fact that characterizes nationalist formations:
they are fundamentally grounded in systems of recognition and desire.
They are formations that constantly strive to make themselves legible to
power, even as they contest power. This feature, probably more than any
other, made cultural- and revolutionary-nationalist formations
vulnerable to institutional solicitation. In a moment in which modern
u.s. institutions were turning to the recognition of difference as part
of a new archival economy, minority nationalisms\' desire for
recognition would make for a golden weakness.]{.underline}

#### The academy denies and dominates other forms of knowledge; Academic Knowledge erases other knowledges through inclusion

**Tuck and Yang '14** (Tuck, E., & Yang, K. W. (2014). R-words: Refusing
research. Humanizing research: Decolonizing qualitative inquiry with
youth and communities, 223-248.)

Said another way, [the academy as an apparatus of settler colonial
knowledge already domesticates, denies, and dominates other forms of
knowledge.]{.underline} It too refuses. It sets limits, but disguises
itself as limitless. Frederic Jameson (1981) writes, "\[H\]istory is
what hurts. It is what refuses desire and sets inexorable limits to
individual as well as collective praxis" (p. 102). For Jameson, history
is a master narrative of inevitability, the logic of teleos and
totality: All events are interconnected and all lead toward the same
horizon of progress. The relentlessness of the master narrative is what
hurts people who find themselves on the outside or the underside of that
narrative. History as master narrative appropriates the voices, stories,
and histories of all Others, thus limiting their representational
possibilities, their expression as epistemo- logical paradigms in
themselves. [Academic knowledge is particular and privi- leged, yet
disguises itself as universal and common; it is settler colonial; it
already refuses desire; it sets limits to potentially dangerous Other
knowl- edges; it does so through erasure, but importantly also through
inclusion, and its own imperceptibility.]{.underline} Jameson's
observation also positions desire as a counterlogic to the history that
hurts. Desire invites the ghosts that history wants exorcised, and
compels us to imagine the possible in what was written as impossible;
desire is haunted. Read this way, desire expands personal as well as
collective praxis.

#### Refusal in research means the use of the academy's resources to study its flaws

**Tuck and Yang '14**( Tuck, E., & Yang, K. W. (2014). R-words: Refusing
research. Humanizing research: Decolonizing qualitative inquiry with
youth and communities, 223-248.)

[One way to think about refusal is how desire can be a framework, mode,
and space for refusal]{.underline}. As a framework, desire is a
counterlogic to the logics of settler colonialism. Rooted in
possibilities gone but not foreclosed, "the *not yet*, and at times, the
*not anymore*" (Tuck, 2010, p. 417), desire refuses the master narrative
that colonization was inevitable and has a monopoly on the future. By
refusing the teleos of colonial future, desire expands possible futures.
[As a mode of refusal, desire is a "no" and a "yes.]{.underline}"
Another way to think about refusal is [to consider using strategies of
social sci- ence research to further expose the complicity of social
science disciplines and research in the project of settler
colonialism.]{.underline} There is much need to employ social science to
turn back upon itself as settler colonial knowledge, as opposed to uni-
versal, liberal, or neutral knowledge without horizon. This form of
refusal might include bringing attention to the mechanisms of knowledge
legitimation, like the Good Labkeeping Seal of Approval (discussed under
Axiom III); contesting appropriation, like the collection of pain
narratives; and publicly renouncing the diminishing of Indigenous or
local narratives with blood narratives in the name of science, such as
in the Havasupai case discussed under Axiom II. As long as the objects
of research are presumably damaged communities in need of intervention,
the metanarrative of social science research remains unchallenged: which
is that research at worst is simply an expansion of common knowledge
(and therefore harmless), and that research at best is problem solving
(and therefore beneficial). This metanarrative justifies a host of
interventions into communities, and treats communities as frontiers to
civilize, *regardless of the specific conclusions of individual research
projects.* Consider, for example, well- intended research on achievement
gaps that fuels NCLB and testing; the docu- mentation of youth violence
that provides the rationales for gang injunctions and the expansion of
the prison industrial complex; the documentation of diabetes as
justification for unauthorized genomic studies and the expansion of
anti- Indigenous theories. Instead, by making the settler colonial
metanarrative the object of social science research, researchers may
bring to a halt or at least slow down the machinery that allows
knowledge to facilitate interdictions on Indigenous and Black life.
Thus, this form of refusal might also involve tracking the relationships
between social science research and expansions of state and corporate
violence against communities. Social science researchers might design
their work to call attention to or interrogate power, rather than
allowing their work to serve as yet another advertisement for power.
[Further, this form of refusal might aim to leverage the resources of
the academy to expand the representa- tional territories fought for by
communities working to thwart settler colonialism]{.underline}. We close
this chapter with much left unsaid. This is both because there is so
much to say, and also because, as we have noted, all refusal is
particular. Refusal understands the wisdom in a story, as well as the
wisdom in not passing that story on. [Refusal in research makes way for
other r-words---for resistance, reclaiming, recovery, reciprocity,
repatriation, regeneration. Though understandings of refusal are still
emergent, though so much is still coming into view, we want to
consolidate a summary of take-away points for our readers. A parting
gift, of sorts, as each of us takes our leave to map our next steps as
researchers, as com- munity members, within and without academe. We
think of this list as a tear-away sheet, something to cut out and carry
in your pocket, sew into a prayer flag, or paste into your field
notebooks.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Ext: Link -- Wounded Attachments

#### Debaters care only about the pain of the subaltern

**Tuck and Yang '14** (Tuck, E., & Yang, K. W. (2014). R-words: Refusing
research. Humanizing research: Decolonizing qualitative inquiry with
youth and communities, 223-248.)

Similarly, at the center of the analysis in this chapter is a concern
with the fixation social science research has exhibited in eliciting
pain stories from com- munities that are not White, not wealthy, and not
straight[. Academe's demon- strated fascination with telling and
retelling narratives of pain is troubling, both for its voyeurism and
for its consumptive implacability. Imagining "itself to be a voice, and
in some disciplinary iterations, the voice of the
colonised]{.underline}" (Simpson, 2007, p. 67, emphasis in the original)
is not just a rare historical occurrence in anthropology and related
fields. We observe that much of the work of the academy is to reproduce
stories of oppression in its own voice. At first, this may read as an
intolerant condemnation of the academy, one that refuses to forgive past
blunders and see how things have changed in recent decades. However, it
is our view that while many individual scholars have cho- sen to pursue
other lines of inquiry than the pain narratives typical of their
disciplines, novice researchers emerge from doctoral programs eager to
launch pain-based inquiry projects because they believe that such
approaches embody what it means to do social science. The collection of
pain narratives and the theories of change that champion the value of
such narratives are so prevalent in the social sciences that one might
surmise that they are indeed what the academy is about. In her
examination of the symbolic violence of the academy, bell hooks (1990)
portrays the core message from the academy to those on the margins as
thus: [No need to hear your voice when I can talk about you better than
you can speak about yourself. No need to hear your voice. Only tell me
about your pain. I want to know your story. And then I will tell it back
to you in a new way. Tell it back to you in such a way that it has
become mine, my own. Re-writing you I write myself anew. I am still
author, authority. I am still colonizer the speaking subject and you are
now at the center of my talk]{.underline}. (p. 343) Hooks's words
resonate with our observation of how much of social science research is
concerned with providing recognition to the presumed voiceless, a
recognition that is enamored with knowing through pain. Further, this
passage describes the ways in which [the researcher's voice is
constituted by, legitimated by, animated by the voices on the
margins]{.underline}. The researcher-self is made anew by telling back
the story of the marginalized/subaltern subject. Hooks works to untangle
the almost imperceptible differences between forces that silence and
forces that seemingly liberate by inviting those on the margins to
speak, to tell their stories. Yet the forces that invite those on the
margins to speak also say, "Do not speak in a voice of resistance. Only
speak from that space in the margin that is a sign of deprivation, a
wound, an unfulfilled longing. Only speak your pain" (hooks, 1990, p.
343). The costs of a politics of recognition that is rooted in naming
pain have been critiqued by recent decolonizing and feminist scholars
(Hartman, 1997, 2007; Tuck, 2009). In *Scenes of Subjection*, Sadiya
Hartman (1997) discusses how rec- ognizing the personhood of slaves
enhanced the power of the Southern slave- owning class. Supplicating
narratives of former slaves were deployed effectively by abolitionists,
mainly White, well-to-do, Northern women, to generate portraits of abuse
that ergo recognize slaves as human (Hartman, 2007). In response, new
laws afforded minimal standards of existence, "making personhood
coterminous with injury" (Hartman, 1997, p. 93), while simultaneously
authorizing necessary violence to suppress slave agency. The slave
emerges as a legal person only when seen as criminal or "a violated body
in need of limited forms of protection" (p. 55). Recognition "humanizes"
the slave, but is predicated upon her or his abjection. *You are in
pain, therefore you are.* "\[T\]he recognition of humanity require\[s\]
the event of excessive violence, cruelty beyond the limits of the
socially tolerable, in order to acknowledge and protect the slave's
person" (p. 55). Furthermore, Hartman describes how slave-as-victim as
human accordingly establishes slave-as-agent as criminal. Applying
Hartman's analysis, we note how the agency of Margaret Garner or Nat
Turner can only be viewed as outsider violence that humane society must
reject while simultaneously upholding the legitimated violence of the
state to punish such outsider violence. Hartman asks, "Is it possible
that such recognition effectively forecloses agency as the object of
punishment . . . Or is this limited conferral of humanity merely a
reinscription of subjugation and pained existence?" (p. 55).

### 2AC -- AT: Trigger Warnings Bad

#### **Trigger warnings require little accommodation; if a trigger warning helps even one person save themselves from reliving trauma then they should happen.**

**Johnson '16** (Maisha Z. Johnson, August 29 2016, Everyday
Feminism,Retrieved from:
<https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/08/trigger-warning-stigma/> Accessed
July 21 19)

We View Mental Illness as a Weakness On most college campuses, there's a
group of people who require protection from injury on a regular basis.
But we don't call them weaklings -- we call them athletes. And you can
bet that your school administration doesn't complain about having to
"coddle" your star football players by giving them helmets and padding
before they take a hit. But when a survivor wants to protect their
mental health by getting a warning before they face a difficult topic,
people frequently use the word "coddling" to refer to their needs. Just
read some of the recent comments on [an Everyday Feminism
article](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/07/opposing-trigger-warnings/)
about trigger warnings: *"I cannot stand the wussification of American
society."* *"If people are too fragile that a mere mention of their
symptoms may bring back their trauma, they are certainly not good enough
to engage in the academic world."* These are common sentiments among
those who oppose trigger warnings. [They conflate being affected by
trauma with being weak, and decide that those who need trigger warnings
aren't "good enough" to be among those who are unfazed. This, in spite
of the fact that so many survivors on college campuses aren't there to
avoid sensitive topics. They're there to learn, just like everyone else,
and they're determined to do this in spite of their personal obstacles,
just like everyone else.]{.underline} Some people need to work full-time
while they're in college in order to attend school. Some need
scholarships. Hell, everyone needs to pay for it somehow, so some rely
on that parental trust fund that will get them through debt-free. I hope
you wouldn't judge someone for having different financial needs than you
do. Mental health needs are similar -- accommodating them simply allows
different people with different sets of circumstances to access the same
opportunities that you have. Facing difficult topics sure doesn't make
you weak. Facing them after directly experiencing trauma takes strength
-- even with the help of a warning. You know what could also help people
face difficult topics? A lifetime without ever being personally affected
by trauma. But I wouldn't call you "weak" if that's the reason you don't
need a warning. 2. We Define 'Strength' as Emotional Unavailability
Strength and healing can show up in so many different ways. Nothing has
taught me this important lesson more than working with other survivors
of violence. For instance, while I did peer advocacy counseling with
[Community United Against Violence](http://www.cuav.org/) (CUAV), the
oldest LGTBQIA+ anti-violence organization in the US, I met survivors
who needed to face their trauma head-on, survivors who needed more time
before they could talk about it, survivors who checked out emotionally
at the mention of their trauma, and more. None of them were wrong. Each
was on their own unique path of learning to cope with what they'd been
through. Consider what it means that many of us are so eager to have
engagement with disturbing topics in settings like college classrooms,
but don't want to actually acknowledge that these topics might disturb
us. I'm one of those who strongly believes that we should be engaging
with issues like sexual violence, abuse, and violent oppression. That's
why I [write about them](http://everydayfeminism.com/author/mjohnson/)
so much. So my support of trigger warnings doesn't mean avoiding them
altogether. [I believe we should engage with them in a way that
acknowledges their real impact. If you think we should all approach
traumatic topics with as much emotional engagement as we'd have for a
math problem, then what you're really asking is for people to disconnect
from the emotions that naturally arise around emotional
topics.]{.underline} There's nothing wrong with acknowledging that
something is painful. But society says that people deserve to be
punished for being "delicate" if they do. I've heard people compare
survivors needing trigger warnings to military combat veterans, saying
that veterans don't "whine" about society not taking care of their
feelings. But they say this as if veterans aren't also suffering -- as
if they don't [have high
rates](http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/i-support-troops-not-military/)
of PTSD and suicide. Clearly, something needs to change if we believe
that people are only strong if they endure painful feelings without
support. 3. We Accept Suffering as Normal -- But Healing Is Asking for
Too Much The idea that survivors who need trigger warnings "can't handle
the real world" is a common accusation. People say that we've all been
through hard things, but the rest of the world is unfazed. It's pretty
sad that we can acknowledge that there's so much suffering in the world,
but get angry at people who have the nerve to cope with that suffering
in a way that others can see. The attitude goes something like this:
"The rest of us have unhealed trauma, so why shouldn't you?" Are you
using ["edgy"
humor](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/03/response-to-racist-jokes/) to
talk about painful issues without acknowledging that they're painful?
That's cool, bro. Are you breaking down only when nobody can see you
cry? Fine, as long as you never admit to it. But admit to needing
support to face something without being re-traumatized? How dare you be
so entitled. One guy in the Everyday Feminism comments said that he used
to have night terrors after being bullied -- but he got over it without
needing trigger warnings, so he didn't see why anyone else should need
them, either. But he had just as much control over his night terrors as
someone would over daytime panic attacks -- as in, not much control at
all. Do you know what it feels like to have a panic attack? Find out
[from Patrick
Roche](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/12/the-perfect-panic-attack/),
then ask yourself if trying to avoid such a terrifying experience really
amounts to being "entitled." [Nobody should have to suffer through the
impact of trauma without support to heal -- and the fact that it's the
norm for people to feel like they just have to "suck it up and get over
it" does not make it okay. It's okay to ask for what you
need]{.underline}. But if you don't personally take that route, don't
shame others for doing so. 4. We Think Trauma Defines Someone or
Something The way some people talk about opposing trigger warnings,
you'd think we were talking about something much more significant than a
few words in front of a text.According to them, it's *censorship!* It's
*the end of free speech!* It's *destroying an entire generation!* It's
*the downfall of society!* Let's cool down for a second and think about
what this means. [Our society seems to think there's something wrong
with [identifying as a
victim](http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/07/rape-victim-not-a-rape-survivor/).
If you've been through something hard in the past, but you got over it,
that's fine -- but acknowledge that it still affects you, and you're
said to be doing a bad thing by "victimizing" yourself.]{.underline} And
some people say they oppose trigger warnings not because they're against
survivors, but to protect the integrity of the classroom. They say that
warning that a text contains disturbing material could influence
students to focus only on that disturbing material, making them think
that's all the text is about. This feeling makes sense if you think
trauma is so significant that acknowledging its impact defines all of
who someone or something is[. We think that being a victim means you're
[permanently
"broken,"](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/09/truths-ipv-survivor-need-know/)
and that being a perpetrator of violence means you're [not
human](http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/02/good-people-can-be-rapists/),
but a [monster](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/02/real-men-do-rape/).
And thinking of violence this way means we don't have to face the fact
that it's an everyday part of our world -- instead, it's such an unusual
thing that acknowledging its impact means being unable to acknowledge
anything else. But I promise you that's not the case]{.underline}. I can
recognize that trauma has an impact on me without having it define the
whole of who I am. I can say that one aspect of a text might have an
emotional impact on its readers without claiming that that aspect is all
there is to it. A trigger warning is just a few words out of the entire
course of a survivor's day, one line to read over the course of their
entire lives. It doesn't define them. And we don't have to be so averse
to victimhood that we can't even talk about it without it taking over
everything. 5. We Think the Way We Handle Things Should Be the Only Way
As a society, we sure do love to judge people who do things differently
than we do. Find out someone has a different kind of culture, sex life,
or relationship style than you do? Judge away! And this unfortunate
habit comes up in trigger warning debates, too[. It's interesting how
our society has [such a
stigma](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/02/people-who-see-a-shrink/)
against going to therapy, but bring up trigger warnings, and suddenly
everyone's a tireless advocate for "exposure therapy." [Exposure
therapy](http://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-exposure-therapy/) involves
gradually facing reminders of your trauma in a safe, controlled
environment under the supervision of a specialized therapist. It can
help retrain your brain to face your triggers without being
re-traumatized, but it doesn't force people to face things without their
consent -- and it uses other coping techniques to avoid
re-traumatization.]{.underline} Having someone with PTSD "toughen up" to
just deal with their triggers at any given time is *not* the same as
exposure therapy. For me, the fact that I'm used to hearing stories of
survival is part of the reason I can read reminders of my trauma without
being thrown into a panic attack. But am I going to tell everyone else
that they need to go lead support groups and counseling sessions about
the things they've been through in order to heal? *Hell* no! It's not
for everyone, and that's okay. The fact is that what works for one
person won't work for everyone. And believing that everyone should heal
like you do doesn't make you an expert -- it kind of just makes you an
asshole. Do you know what happens when people decide their wellness
practices are the only valid wellness practices? They judge people who
[take
medication](http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/05/stop-saying-about-anti-depressants/)
for not trying yoga instead, or judge people who go to therapy for not
just trying prayer, or judge people who cry in public for not keeping
their tears behind closed doors. See a pattern here[? Every single
person has a different set of needs -- so there will always be someone
who needs something you don't. If directly facing difficulties has
helped you, that's great. But you'll save yourself and others a lot of
trouble if you drop the idea that anyone who doesn't heal like you do
deserves to be judged. Maybe a trigger warning seems silly to you
because you don't need it. Luckily for you, that means the presence or
the absence of a trigger warning doesn't have an impact on your
life.]{.underline} So you'll be just fine if you step back from this
debate and let people ask for what they need without being judged. All
of this shows that we as a society really need a shift in how we
understand emotional needs, mental health, and responses to violence and
trauma. The status quo says that we should all suck it up, get over it,
keep moving forward without ever acknowledging the impact that trauma
can have. And we can learn a lot about our culture by noticing how
"controversial" it is to suggest changing the status quo. "Welcome to
the real world," you'd say to someone who'd like a warning before they
face a sensitive topic. I'd like to invite you to face reality, too.
[The reality is that trauma affects many different people in many
different ways. It's okay to acknowledge painful feelings, to approach
sensitive topics not only as sources of new ideas, but also sources of
deep emotional reactions, and to accept that traumatic events affect our
emotional and mental health. A trigger warning won't stop you from
facing painful realities -- but it'll definitely help some people face
them, and continue healing from the impact of them, too.]{.underline}

## Framework Modules

### 1NC Shell -- Body Politics

#### Interpretation -- the body not the plan should be the focus of the debate. The affirmative should perform and defend a reduction in arm sales. 

#### Violation -- The affirmative has called for action from an external actor and does not actualize their solvency inside of the debate. 

#### Standards

#### Presumption -- the affirmative doesn't reduce arm sales, they only suggests a reduction in arm sales which doesn't resolve any of the 1ACs impacts -- vote negative on presumption. 

#### Limits -- plan-focus and disembodied debates blow the lid off the topic -- there are an infinite amount of hypothetical actions the USFG could take -- the USFG is inherently unpredictable for oppressed group. Policy-focus is unlimited because there are an infinite amount of levers of power for white people to oppress -- makes restricting the origins of violence more limited and predictable than how to limit that violence from a governmental standpoint

#### Neg ground -- we can't get access to our DAs or counter-plans that compete off of the performance or method of the 1AC because those exist outside the hypothetical imagining of the plan -- this kills neg ground crucial to survival strategies in debate which culminates in the death of the minority subject in debate

#### Topic Specific Education -- disembodied debate forces aff's to run to the margins forcing negatives to run to the margins, both pursuing strategies meant to undermine substantive discussions of the topic. Body-focused debate would have aff teams discuss how their particular performance is good and encourage the negative team to argue against the actions of the affirmative.

#### Voters -- Framework is a voting issue for accessibility and reversing the death of the minority subject in debate -- this debate is about competing-interpretations which means it is what you do AND what you justify.

### 1NC Shell - Activism

#### Our interpretation is that debate should be a cite for social and political activism. The affirmative must reduce arms sales from the United States.

#### Violation -- the affirmative does not reduce restrictions -- they merely present a plan or suggestion for the federal government to reduce arm sales.

#### C. Standards:

#### 1. Survivor Skills -- survival skills are key to both resistance and existence. People who exist on the margins of civil society need ways to not only engage the state but the conditions the state has created.

#### 2. Limits -- There are an infinite number of potential plans and policy proposals that the affirmative could fiat, but there is a limited amount of ways the bodies in this debate can reduce arm sales. 

#### 3. Ground -- aff interpretation destroys our disadvantage ground based on individual action and forces us to defend USFG inaction -- they make it impossible to be negative.

#### 4. Plan focus debate is bad- 

#### a. Topic education -- the aff encourages bad debate practices like conditionality, plan-inclusive counterplan, international fiat, process pics and a myriad of other bad debate practices because we should debate only the merits of the plan.

#### b. Activism good -- plan focus necessitates that we invest our advocacy in bureaucratic institutions as opposed to people. This displaces or agency and makes us slaves to the state. 

#### c. Fiat is bad -- it is not real and won't produce the material changes needed to resolve the affirmative. This trivializes the violence people experience and uses them as a pawn in a game of debate. 

#### We shouldn't succumb to the institutional demands of our professional lives -- it is our obligation as ethical actors to break-out of the logic doubling, or the idea that we are not responsible when higher powers, like the topic committee, traditional debate, and literalist interpretation of the resolution, tell us what to do.  The alternative is a form of political imagination that can't conceive of difference and culminates in mass death.

**Fasching and deChant 2001** (Darrell and Dell, Prof. of Religious
Studies @ University of South Florida, Prof. of Religious Studies @ USF,
Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, Pg. 42-43)

[Interpreting our own historical situation is a risky business, for we
are still too close to the events. We do not have the distance needed to
put everything into proper perspective. Nevertheless, without such an
interpretation it is impossible to identify the ethical challenges that
face us, so we must risk it]{.underline}. In this chapter we argue that
[two major trends unfolded in the twentieth century that are of
significance for thinking about ethics: (1) the phenomenon of mass
killing encouraged by sacred narratives that authorize \"killing in
order to heal,\" as symbolized by Auschwitz and Hiroshima, and (2) a
cross-cultural and interreligious ethic of non-violent
resistance]{.underline} or civil disobedience symbolized by figures like
Gandhi and King -- one [that functions as an ethic of audacity on behalf
of the stranger. The second, we suggest, offers an ethic of the holy in
response to the sacred morality of the first.]{.underline} [The modern
period, which began with a utopian hope that science and technology
would create an age of peace, prosperity, and progress, ended in an
apocalyptic nightmare of mass death, symbolized by Auschwitz and
Hiroshima, leaving us with the task of creating a post/modern ethic that
can transcend the techno-bureaucratic tribalism that expressed itself in
two world wars]{.underline}. Technobureaucratic tribalism occurs when
sacred narratives are combined with the technical capacity to produce
mass death. While we do not pretend to offer an exhaustive explanation
of the modern propensity for mass death, we do suggest two key elements:
(1) [the use of sacred narratives that define killing as a form of
healing, and (2) the undermining of ethical consciousness by
techno-bureaucratic organization through a psychological process of
doubling (separating one\'s personal and professional identities), which
enables individuals to deny that they are responsible for some of their
actions.]{.underline} Through sacred stories, the stranger is defined as
less than human and therefore beyond the pale of ethical obligation, as
well as a threat to sacred order. At the same time, [bureaucracies
encourage one to engage in a total surrender of self in unquestioning
obedience to higher (sacred) authority]{.underline} (whether God,
religious leaders, or political leaders), [so that when one acts as a
professional self on behalf of an institution (the state, the military,
the church, etc.) one can say, \"It is not I that acts: a higher
authority is acting through me, so I am not personally
responsible.\"]{.underline} Yet, despite the seemingly overwhelming
dominance of techno- bureaucratic tribalism and mass killing in the
twentieth century, a modest but important counter-trend also emerged --
a cross-cultural and interreligious ethic of audacity on behalf of the
stranger, linked to such names as Tolstoy, Gandhi, and King. The purpose
of this chapter is to grasp the ethical challenge of modernity as
symbolized by Auschwitz and Hiroshima. [The purpose]{.underline} of the
remainder of this book [is to examine the potential of the ethical
response to that challenge offered by the tradition of non-violent civil
disobedience, symbolized by Gandhi and King, for a cross-cultural and
interreligious post/modern ethic of human dignity, human rights, and
human liberation.]{.underline}

[The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50

State there are at least two additional levels of government, generally
designated as counties and cities, towns or villages. The relationships
between different levels of government are complex and varied (see
Section B for more information). [The Federal Government is composed of
**three branches**: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and

**researchers** in the social sciences]{.underline} of many colleges and
universities [exploit the struggles of oppressed peoples. Oppressed
peoples are **left stranded**]{.underline} with little to no resources
[after researchers leave their communities high and dry. Researchers
steal value from oppressed peoples by making them the subjects of
**theoretical research**]{.underline} [without lending them access to
information that could]{.underline} better [help their
communities.]{.underline} Articles, [books]{.underline}, and
dissertations [written about marginalized populations are written for
academics]{.underline}, not working people, [and]{.underline} as such
[have little impact on the people whose lives are the
subject]{.underline} of this research. [Liberal academics]{.underline}
and social scientists [are]{.underline} [more concerned about
**developing** the wealth of academic literature than addressing the
immediate **material concerns**]{.underline} of the communities they
research. Penelope Herideen is a Sociology researcher in Western
Massachusetts (MA) and a professor of Sociology at the local community
college from which I recently graduated. Herideen has written about the
importance of critical pedagogy in community colleges. "Policy,
Pedagogy, and Social Inequality: Community College Student Realities In
Post-Industrial America" was the title of Herideen's research discussing
the realities that community college students face as they navigate
their social and academic worlds. Herideen's research is important, and
yet, she was hardly involved in student organizing campaigns against
budget cuts that affect low-income students. Community college [students
need resources developed through research]{.underline} like Herideen's[.
This is a major flaw in academic research in the social
sciences.]{.underline} Liberal academics and social scientists need to
understand their effect on the communities and people they study.
[Oppressed people who are put under the **magnifying glass** of
**academic research** have to live with **real consequences** after the
**researcher leaves.**]{.underline} This is especially true in the field
of women's and ethnic studies --- where [class, gender, and race
consciousness are a part of the research process. Researchers leave
behind a **stranded community** with little to **no resources** to help
them **organize movements** that will create **real

activist receives thousands of dollars for speaking at various colleges
and universities about the impact that white privilege and white

these communities in any real or substantial way, such as offering
resources and support to the various communities he speaks of in his
writings. [Researchers]{.underline} in the fields of women's and ethnic
studies [entering oppressed communities without any desire to change

created out of the social movements]{.underline} of the 1960s. The aims
of the people who started these fields of study were [to catapult a

and women. These goals were met in conflict with a desire]{.underline}
in academia [to **concentrate knowledge** among groups of **specialized
elites**, instead of a focus on popularizing this knowledge for the
greater good.]{.underline} Try reading any academic text from your local
women's studies, ethnic studies, post-colonial studies, or anthropology
department. The texts are almost always written so that only academics
can understand. Some students and scholars call it
"**[acadamese]{.underline}**." It is writing that [needs to be
**decoded** before it can be **understood**.]{.underline} This is what
inaccessible language looks like in academic texts written about
oppressed groups, but not for them. Indian writer and activist Arundhati
Roy discusses the importance of "ordinary language" in social justice
work in her speech given at Hampshire College in 2001: I think it's
vital to de-professionalize the public debate on matters that vitally
affect the lives of ordinary people. It's time to snatch our futures
back from the 'experts.' Time to ask, in ordinary language, the public
question and to demand, in ordinary language, the public answer. Roy
purposefully writes for oppressed groups of people by writing in
"ordinary language." Ordinary language becomes extraordinary when groups
of people who have been historically "othered" are able to read
something that connects to their lives. Academics who use "ordinary
language" are able to encourage oppressed groups to consider their own
agency in the fight for social, economic and political justice. Their
advisors and colleagues constantly berate academics that attempt to
write in ordinary language because their writing is "too accessible."
**[Academics]{.underline}** use academic language and jargon to
[**centralize knowledge** and **power** in their hands.]{.underline}
Academics would lose a certain amount of power if everyone had access to
the same knowledge that they do. The division of labor in [the ivory
tower reinforces **capitalist modes of production** through
individualized research and study]{.underline} that is hardly ever
shared with those it most affects. This is how academia operates
knowledge in the form of transactions that create restricted, instead of
shared knowledge. [**Liberal academics** become **gatekeepers of
knowledge** by reinforcing ideas that **knowledge** should be **bought**
and **sold** instead of **shared** among communities that are studied.
In turn, serious activists]{.underline} who wish to create a world

their communities]{.underline} through work in the non-profit sector.

#### 3) [Prefer black Switch Side Debate]{.underline} -- Relying on pre-conceived convictions fuels dogmatism and reduces the capacity for nuanced self-reflexivity in relation to the resolution

**Evans '12** -- Rashad Evans, JD - National debate champion, "The 1NC,"
rwesq.com, November 20 2012, http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/)

Now, the debate! First, let me look at Casey Harrigan's ("CH")
definition of SSD. He says that : Definition: switch side debate (SSD)
is the practice that requires debaters to argue both for and against a
given topic in alternating rounds. In effect, it has meant that
debaters' arguments are divorced from personal conviction and instead
made contingently as a means of "testing" the truth value of a
proposition. I will accept this definition, but I think it requires some
more refinement. In a practical sense, [SSD]{.underline}, at a minimum,
[requires that the affirmative defend the resolution]{.underline}. For
the most part, the negative is unconstrained (except by competition) and
[most debates in which SSD comes up the question is whether the
affirmative team should be required to affirm the topic, including some
defense of an action by the United States Federal
Government]{.underline} ("USFG"). The [essential question posed by SSD
is whether the affirmative team should be required to defend the
resolution even when they (1) fundamentally disagree with all or part of
it and/or (2) are compelled to affirm other ideas because of their
"personal convictions]{.underline}." **[The answer to this question must
be yes]{.underline}**. First, [there are multiple ways to]{.underline}
skin a cat and even more ways to [affirm the resolution in the world of
parametric debate]{.underline} because one need only affirm an
interpretation of the resolution and not the resolution writ large.
Therefore, [there are rare instances in which there is no interpretation
of the resolution that you cannot defend and these rare instances are
most likely the product of lack of creativity and research]{.underline}.
So in reality, the question is an even simpler one: should the
affirmative team be required to defend an interpretation of the
resolution. [There are immense constitutive and instrumental benefits to
SSD that cannot be otherwise obtained]{.underline} and therefore must be
required. I ask that the judges: George, Justin and Kyla evaluate this
debate holistically, which requires that they evaluate the benefits of
SSD to the speaker (constitutive) and to society (instrumental). This
also requires that they exclude nothing in their analysis of this
debate. The Constitutive Debaters benefit from SSD. [It requires that
they engage in topics that they may not otherwise engage.]{.underline}
The resolution poses a unique question and the debate round is a unique
time to answer that question. One is much more likely to consider their
personal convictions outside of the debate round than they are to
consider the resolution outside the debate round. Therefore,
[independently of whether one agrees with the resolution or not, there
are benefits to defending an interpretation of the resolution in that it
requires you to consider something you may not have otherwise
considered]{.underline}. These [thought experiments create more informed
and thoughtful debaters and citizens. SSD creates a unique opportunity
for self-reflexivity]{.underline}. The idea is to let your personal
convictions guide you in the debate. The resolution doesn't require that
you suppress your identity or convictions, but is instead an opportunity
to infuse that identity and those convictions into the resolution and
public policy discussion. So, given who you are, what you believe and
what you know what say you regarding energy production? What say you
regarding democracy assistance? What say you regarding federal control
in Indian Country? Therefore, the resolution is an opportunity for you
to refine your personal convictions and put your identity in politics
instead of relying exclusively on identity politics. SSD allows you to
check your own privilege. Here, I will rely on my personal experience. I
once participated in a 30 day creative challenge where the challenge
leader would pose questions on facebook and the group would answer them
in the comments section. One day he asked us to imagine we could be the
other gender for 3 days and to discuss what would we do. I thought about
this on the A-train from Harlem to Chelsea and again from Chelsea to
Harlem and had no answer because I couldn't imagine being a woman. I
explained that as a gay man I don't need to be a woman to have sex with
a man, I don't want a baby in me and more importantly I don't want the
physical vulnerability of being a woman. This realization really forced
me to reevaluate my previous jokes even that as a gay many I was
ontologically indistinct from a woman. I am not. I am gay and I am
black...in many ways I am the the worlds bottom, but even I could would
not want to occupy the body of a woman. That thought experiment taught
me a lot about myself, privilege and the world. Sometimes, you have to
take a walk in someone else's stiletto to learn who you really are.
Seriously CH, have you walked in stilettos? It will change your life.
**[SSD is both necessary and sufficient to ensure that you debate your
personal convictions.]{.underline}** Remember, [if you are staunchly
opposed to the resolution you get to lodge those complaints on the
negative]{.underline}. Also, remember that what is good for the goose is
good for the gander and if you don't have to debate the resolution then
no one has to debate the resolution. This [loosening of the restrictions
on the resolution may mean that no one gets to debate anything they
want. I mean lets face it, no one wants to be topical]{.underline}!
There's always a better version of your aff that isn't topical. Every
2AC considers severance or intrinsicness because the resolution is
flawed or insufficient. However, a true debater understands that they
both have to debate on the affirmative and the negative and that [in
order to do either effectively there must be stability in the
relationship between the affirmative and the negative]{.underline}.
Therefore, [committing yourself to the resolution is key preserving your
own negative ground to engage in your critique of the
resolution]{.underline}. As goes the resolution so goes your personal
convictions about that resolution. [The Instrumental SSD is the only way
to organize a fair debate tournament]{.underline}. We must have a topic.
There must be rules and allowing any and everyone go rogue because of
their "personal convictions" it is a recipe for disaster. I don't want
to live and debate in that world. There must be strict requirements on
defending the resolution to allow for fair and predictable negative
ground. By the way, protecting fair negative ground is easier and more
important than all other concerns regarding fairness. [All people of all
convictions have to be negative at some point.]{.underline} Which means
that the affirmative-negative dialiectic is the only intersectional
analysis that can be performed because all people of all identities will
eventually find themselves on the affirmative or negative side in
debate. [Preserving negative ground then preserves the
ground]{.underline} of women, minorities and hippies. SSD ensures that
we have all hands on deck in these extraordinary times. We need all
perspectives and all peoples to engage in all debates. SSD facilitates
this. Allowing students to pick their own topic because of their
"personal convictions" may mean that important issues get ignored all
together. I mean, what would happen if we let the students set the
curriculum? Would they learn anything, ever? How many times have you
heard these questions in a classroom: why do I have to learn this? Will
this be on the exam? My major is X, why do I need to learn Y? Blah. Yes,
students would almost always like to do what they want to do. If we
allowed this where would we be as a country? Who will be there to tackle
the important questions pertaining to immigration, energy production,
the Arab Spring, etc? Engaging the resolution from your specific social
location can cause others to change their views. [There are several
examples of creative interpretations of the resolution that have
inspired folk to view the topic and life differently]{.underline}. [This
is when debate is at its best]{.underline} and when it's engaging in
important knowledge production. Debate and debaters have the potential
to infuse new arguments, ideas and perspectives into the resolution and
into the broader discussion. Now, the line by line! CH says: 1. It
presumes debate as a "pedagogical bull-pen", which undermines the
activity's potential for radical change. Students are told "you can't
know anything until you debate both sides", ignoring the VAST WEALTH of
lived experience that underwrites specific claims about identity, the
world, praxis, and the topic. In some ways, it is like Loyola's argument
about info accumulation -- we are told to place a hold on "conviction"
until we have "enough information" and "enough testing" when in reality
there is either never a point where "enough is enough" OR we have
\*already\* crossed that point and should be able to utilize the debate
space for advocacy. It makes debate into a game about hypothetical
action rather than a potential site for social justice. First, there are
radically topical interpretations of the resolution. Second, how does
one know that their lived experience is dispositive of any debate
without testing it against the research and lived experiences of others.
It's not that you can't know anything until you debate both sides but
more importantly that you debate both sides before you conclude you know
anything. Lastly, there is no internal link between resolutional debate
and the loss of social justice. In fact, one should always debate the
resolution in a way that produces social justice. 2. It is anti-Black.
[The norm of SSD and topic construction mandating USFG action presume
that public policy is valuable because it is equally accessible to all
participants, when in reality access is ANYTHING BUT that]{.underline},
relies on a belief that USFG action is a locus for change when in
reality and history it has produced the opposite, marginalizes
individual perspectives as "too local", and does not account for the
specific conditions of Black participation in debate. Your
anti-Blackness argument is without warrant. **[To the extent that
anti-Blackness is a problem, SSD is the solution]{.underline}**.
Certainly, holding on to ones conviction in avoidance of debate has
never benefited Black people in the past. Thinking itself is Blackness
(whiteness is anti-thought), so [avoiding a debate because of personal
conviction is quintessentially anti-Black]{.underline}. In fact, many of
debates current ills stem from people avoiding debates and holding fast
to their convictions. Also, **[the USFG is not uniquely
anti-Black]{.underline}**. [The world is anti-Black, so to isolate the
USFG is to fundamentally misunderstand Blackness]{.underline}. [The USFG
has been a locus for change where others have failed.]{.underline} [For
instance, the civil rights act]{.underline} regulated the racist
behavior of private individuals and corporations. [School
desegregation]{.underline} required federal intervention to ensure state
compliance with the constitution. [The Violence Against Women's
Act]{.underline} regulates individual behavior in the home which was
once considered a private matter. [This is]{.underline} not to suggest
that the USFG is a saint, but [to suggest that the question requires
more nuance and that **nuance is provided only by SSD**]{.underline}.
The specific conditions of Blackness require SSD. After years of
exclusion from education generally and debate specifically, its right
time that we jump into the discussions. **[Black SSD not equal white
SSD]{.underline}**. [Black debaters are the future and they will remake
the world partially in an image of themselves. This requires that they
theorize their Blackness across topics, resolutions and
debates.]{.underline} This is the revolution we are waiting for.

## 1NC -- Alternative Models of Debate

### 1NC -- Collaborative Model

#### Prefer the collaborative model as opposed to the adversarial nature of plan -centric debate -- pure competition is bad -- argument polarization, mitigates results, and ignores nuance in strategies

**Komoroske 16** (Alex Komoroske, Group Product Manager and Staff
Writer, "Debate should be collaborative, not combative", Medium,
https://medium.com/@komorama/debate-should-be-collaborative-not-combative-185ff37f1d34)//AR

The title might seem ridiculously over-generalized. [Debate tournaments
in high school]{.underline}, for example, [are a public battle of ideas
that have a clear winner and a loser]{.underline}. Surely those should
be combative? Of course they should --- [they're a classic zero-sum
game, where if one side wins the other must lose.]{.underline} But this
form of debate, while familiar, is extremely rare in real life and not
particularly important in the grand scheme of things. Its familiarity
means that when we hear "debate" we too often jump straight to a
combative stance. [The far more important type of debate in the real
world is a wholly different animal]{.underline}. It, too, is about
pitting ideas against one another to find the strongest one. But [unlike
in high-school debate, the team who advances the strongest idea isn't
the winner. The goal is to uncover the best solution to a given problem:
to understand a complex and ambiguous problem space as fully as
possible]{.underline}. Who had the best idea is immaterial. Unlike a
high-school debate, [**this framing reveals it to be a positive-sum
game.** And that difference between zero- and positive-sum game makes
all of the difference]{.underline}. [In a zero sum game, the proper
stance is competitive. But in a positive sum game, the proper stance is
collaborative]{.underline}. If the two parties together come to a better
understanding than either had individually before, everyone wins. How to
approach a collaborative debate No one knows everything. Everyone
approaches problems in a different way. This diversity, if properly
harnessed, can lead to better results than any one party could have come
up with on their own. [Seek to understand the other parties' insights,
concerns, and confusions]{.underline}. [If they have an insight, then
you can incorporate it and make the leading idea better.]{.underline} If
they have a legitimate concern then you can improve your idea to better
defend against it (or, if it's significant enough, pivot to a better
approach altogether). And even if they are confused, figuring out how to
help them understand will help you communicate your idea more
effectively to others in the future. [In a collaborative stance you go
into the debate willing to learn and willing to change course when
presented with better arguments or data]{.underline}. Riff off of one
another's ideas. [Try different framings, different models, different
metaphors and see which ones stick]{.underline} --- and then build off
of those. At all times focus on adding positive energy to the
exploration. Staying in a collaborative stance is difficult, and it's
easy to accidentally shift back into a combative stance. Be careful not
to privilege your own ideas. Be on the watch for emotional responses to
critiques or competing ideas --- if left unchecked they tend to cause
similar responses in others, derailing the whole discussion. It's
tempting to conclude that your debate partners are not participating in
good faith, or are taking a combative stance. But challenge yourself to
assume good faith and to always bring the other participants back to a
collaborative stance whenever they stray. After all, everyone has a
shared interest in identifying the best solution, and the only way to do
that is to maintain a collaborative stance. [If, with patience and a
willing partner, you are not able to convince the other that your idea
is superior, than perhaps it isn't]{.underline}. Get to the root of the
disagreement, the core point where you don't see eye to eye. Is it a
misunderstanding? A legitimate disagreement? Different assumptions about
the value of a currently unknown quantity? Work until you uncover it and
fully understand it. Th[e collaborative approach to debate is one of the
best ways to understand complex, and especially ambiguous, problem
spaces. The result is a stronger idea that more perfectly anticipates
the messy reality it will have to operate within.]{.underline}

"In fact, we don't have to reach very far at all to find a blank-out
campaign in our world. In 1998, Puerto Rican voters were faced with a
referendum about the status of the island. They were given a choice
between statehood, independence, free association, commonwealth, or none
of the above. A heated debate arose over the definitions of the terms.
The definition of commonwealth, in particular, raised some concerns. So
a campaign was launched to vote "none of the above." That vote signaled
a refusal to accept the given options; it was a political act to not
play the game as scripted. "None of the above" won 50.2 percent of the
vote. We need to do something that bold. Something that will upset the
entire game. In 2016, we should call for an "electoral blank-out." We
vote in the national election for the presidency of the United States,
but we leave the ballot blank or write in "none of the above." This
isn't your standard call for a third-party candidate or an independent
black political thrust. Nor is it a rejection of our sacred duty to
vote. Exercising the franchise is sacred. "Actually, I want black people
to turn out for the election in record numbers without Obama on the
ticket, but give our attention to other issues on the ballot. We should
vote in congressional, state, and local elections. [Elections are
important, but they are hardly the only work of democracy]{.underline}.
[For too long we've been sold a bill of goods that this person or that
one will do what we need, if only we can get them elected.]{.underline}
This promise wants us to believe that voting is democracy. But that's
only half true. Sure, we must work overtime (sadly) to ensure that no
one rolls back the gains of the Voting Rights Act and that everyone has
access to the ballot. [But the work of democracy does not end with
elections."]{.underline} "**[We should turn our attention to efforts
like the Forward Together moral movement and the Dream Defenders and
#BlackLivesMatter]{.underline}**, or to [mobilizing around public school
closings in our neighborhoods]{.underline}. **[Some issue, concrete and
right in front of us, should be our focus.]{.underline}** A collateral
effect, although not the main objective, would be the election of men
and women at the state and local levels who aren't about symbolism and
celebrity, but who put forward a strategic vision for our communities.
([When elections become the primary aim of grassroots mobilization, the
conditions for demobilization are built into the very
activity]{.underline}. [If you succeed, you are often left twiddling
your thumbs]{.underline}.) The hope would be that the "Blank-Out 2016"
campaign could change the tone and focus of American politics, and
demonstrate that black folk have finally gotten sick and tired of being
sick and tired." "[The core of the campaign would be a coordinated
effort---a networked coalition---of grassroots organizations whose
primary task in the run-up to the election would be to focus attention
on particular issues in the black community]{.underline}. These
organizations would urge black voters to leave the presidential ballot
blank or to write "none of the above." But [the trade-off would be to
take up an issue (or issues) that requires our attention beyond the
election cycle]{.underline}. The idea is to use the presidential
election as a moment to disrupt the notion that democracy rests
primarily with elections and to reject black liberal politics. [Combined
with action in the street, we could shut down the power of politics as
usual in this country. I am suggesting a seismic shift in black
politics]{.underline}. Obviously, we can't stand idly by as Democrats
take our votes for granted and cave to forces that devastate our
communities. Nor can extremists on the right and those who enable them
expect us to sit back as they trade in racist nonsense, continue to
legislate for the 1 percent, and undo the modest gains we've made in
this country. What has become crystal clear over these past few years,
at least to me, is that business as usual isn't sufficient; that [the
typical black characters on the national scene have to be called out for
what they have failed to do and say in the face of what has happened and
is happening in black America]{.underline}." "I want to be clear. **[I
am not suggesting that we concede the national political
scene]{.underline}** [(although I am certainly suspicious of
it).]{.underline} Instead, we have to reboot national politics---change
the flow of the current. [Here intensified local efforts enter into a
network of other local practices across the country that, taken
together, have national political implications]{.underline}. **[You can
build a national politics from the ground up rather than think about it
as decisions that flow from the top down]{.underline}**. [That's what
the protests did. They connected what happened to Michael Brown in
Missouri and Jessica Hernandez in Colorado and John Crawford III and
Tanisha Anderson in Ohio with Eric Garner in New York and Trayvon Martin
in Florida and Ezell Ford in California and Yvette Smith in Texas and
Tony Terrell Robinson Jr. in Wisconsin]{.underline}. The same has
happened with the reaction to the closing of schools in places like
Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia, and with struggles for a livable
wage for workers at Walmart and McDonald's all across the country. [We
can do what the civil rights icon Ella Baker did]{.underline}, in her
early days of [organizing NAACP chapters]{.underline}. She established
pathways, connections, and conduits that "linked her practice across the
United States. Like her, [we can build a network of local efforts that
can give us a more robust form of democratic politics.]{.underline}
[Collectively, such grassroots work]{.underline}---people doing what
they do in their communities linking up with other people doing similar
work in their communities---[loosely constitutes a national
politics."]{.underline}

### 2NC Overview -- Body Ptx/Activism

#### Structural violence structurally disadvantages debate. Our age alone prohibits us from democratically participating nor could we actualize change in Washington DC from Austin, Texas; however, the PURPOSE of debate, or at least THIS debate, should debate as a location of activism.  This would mean that the affirmative must reduce arms sales from the United States. This is necessary to situate conversations around what WE can do now and not what can happen later. Some students do not have the luxury of using this space as training, rather it is their primary avenue to action which makes it critical to actualize this spaces potential.

#### The affirmative does not meet our interpretation: 

#### \<insert impacted no meet arguments including, but not limited to the plan does not happen, USFG as an actor, debate as a game etc, plan based strategies are bad.\>

#### Prefer our interpretation -

#### a. Presumption - nothing about the affirmative will produce the advantages discussed in the debate. You should immediately vote negative when they do not materially change the status quo.  b. Survival Skills - We need not learn how to act later, but engage in action now. Similar to the 1acs impacts something needs to be done today. We can learn the material outcome of our actions today which will help fine tune activism later, but solves our argument about the necessity of action today. The affirmative would encroach on those skills by devaluing the knowledge that students bring to the activity and the perspective they bring about what should be done now. Perspectivism is net-benefit to our method because it encourages students to relate to the topic via their experience. 

#### c. Limits - They make it impossible to be negative. They could make the united states do literally anything or engage in an infinity amount of thought experiments which makes burden of being negative insurmountable. Placing limits on the affirmative\'s direct actions avoids exploding debate and actualizes the power of debate to be a vehicle for change. 

#### We will win that their proposed model of plan-focused debate is bad:

### 2NC - 1. Unlimiting

#### a.       Makes it impossible to be negative -- we would have access to any and every action by the USFG multiplied by fiat which explodes the negative research burden which turns their interpretation.

#### b.       Makes it impossible to be affirmative -- crushes our potential to use our experiences to relate to the topic. We would have to rewrite our experiences to cater to the topic and not our needs which literally makes debate impossible because it does not address our everyday needs

### 2NC - 2.  Anti-educational

#### a.       Conditionality -- it allows it and encourages it. Condo is a voting issue because it encourages argumentative irresponsibility, kitchen sink strategies, and multiple contradictory arguments and destroys affirmatives competitive equities. 

#### b.      Plan Inclusive counterplans -- plan focus guarantees PICs. PICs are a voting issue because they steal aff ground and for the aff to debate itself, encourages vague plan writing which destroys negs ground and result in trivial distinctions between the plan and the counterplan like a penny saved is a penny earned. You cannot PIC out of an embodied performance.

#### c.       Process CPs -- Neg's interpretation allows it because they focus on the process of implementation. Process PICs are a voting issue because they destroy topic specific education, they destroy the aff because they include the affirmative, and lastly, they are limitless and unpredictable. If you hate conditions, consult, and dirty word PICs - vote for us!

### 2NC -- 3. \<insert aff specific state-based offense\>

## 2NC -- Extensions

Evans debated prior to the emergence of performance styles of debate. As
Duane Hartman says, he debated in a traditional, mainstream style. He
was undoubtedly used as an example of Black debaters fitting in to the
community and excelling. However, even [for Rashad Evans, racism was a
problem. He assimilated]{.underline}, at least in terms of outward
performance[, and yet, he still experienced problems as a Black man in
the debate world]{.underline}. Prior to the Louisville team's emergence,
[the choice of rejecting or assimilating seemed to be the two options
for debaters of color]{.underline}. And yet we see that [for Rashad
Evans, a decision to assimilate did not mean that a person of color
would be treated equally to his or her white peers]{.underline}. John
Calmore (2005) describes racialized Black identity as performance, and
whiteness as audition (p. 100). 21 ["Non-white performance in a
dominantly white setting has been a historical predicament\.... Indeed,
the rights enjoyed by white males could only be obtained by assimilatory
behavior\.... white performance was the quid pro quo for white
privilege"]{.underline} (Calmore, 2005, p. 102). This assimilatory
behavior, this performance of whiteness by a person of color, is always
audition for Calmore, because of a historical "universality of
\[combined\] white experience \[and\] judgment as the authoritative
standard that binds people of color and normatively measures, directs,
controls, and regulates the terms of proper thought, expression,
presentment, and behavior" (Calmore, 1995, p. 318). [Performance of
whiteness is always conditional to acceptance from whites; who as part
of white dominance "normatively measure" the performance for
acceptability.]{.underline} Rashad 21 I will discuss the performance of
race at more length in Chapter 5. 171 [Evans may have]{.underline}
performed whiteness and through the quid pro quo described by Calmore,
[achieved some success in the white-normed debate world.
However]{.underline}, according to Calmore [his performance was always
an audition,]{.underline} always [subject to special
scrutiny]{.underline}. [Some found that performance wanting and he was
then subject to racialized performance of white dominance]{.underline}.
[Instead of rejecting the practice altogether, or assimilating into its
current manifestation, performance debaters and their coaches, starting
with the transcendent Louisville Malcolm X squad, have collectively
created a third way. This radical alternative to the conventional
practice of debate is rooted in the expression of student voice and
experience]{.underline} (usually but not exclusively as people of color)
and based on a crucial recognition of social structure in constant
struggle with agency (again, usually but not always race-based). [The
debaters and coaches, moreover, function as a positive racebased
community working for liberation and the uplift of oppressed
communities]{.underline}, in this case the African American community in
the city of Baltimore. In this chapter I discuss these aspects of the
practice, before explaining the practice itself as an agentic mode of
performance and doing

#### A static interpretation of how we should debate assumes debate as a monolithic, rich and white activity, functionally excluding debaters who don't fit into those dichotomies.

for instance, through verbal communication, ways of dressing, gestures,
signs, facial expressions, written text and symbols. All of these things
combine to make up communication between people possible. Particular
language patterns and meanings are understood according to the meaning
prescribed by factors such as culture (Boas, 1911; Sapir, 1921; Whorf,
1956); the economy (Bourdieu, 1977; Irvine, 1989); cognition (Lakoff,

unstable mutual interaction of meaningful sign forms contextualized to

some of the methods utilized by alternative debaters victimize Debate
(Zompetti, 2004), are less productive for the goals of debate
competition (Atchison and Panetta, 2009), and do not maximize the

Sparks 03 (Holloway Sparks, 7/29/18,

In this essay, I argue [that contemporary democratic theory gives
insufficient attention to the important contributions dissenting
citizens make to democratic life. Guided by the dissident practices of
activist women, I develop a more expansive conception of citizenship
that recognizes dissent and an ethic of political courage as vital
elements of democratic participation. I illustrate how this perspective
on citizenship recasts and reclaims women's courageous dissidence by
reconsidering the well-known story of Rosa Parks]{.underline}. A black
woman named Rosa Parks refuses to give up her seat to a white man on a
Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955 and goes to jail. A group of welfare
mothers led by [Johnnie May Tillmon]{.underline} challenges the attempts
of white, middle-class male organizers to assume leadership roles in the
welfare rights movement in 1966. Poet, activist, and black lesbian
feminist [Audre Lorde]{.underline} pointedly calls white feminists to
account for their racism, classism, and homophobia during the 1981
National Women's Studies Association meeting. Activist [Candace
Gingrich]{.underline} comes out publicly as a lesbian following the
election of her conservative half-brother Newt as Speaker of the House
in 1994[. In spite of the crucial roles these activist women have played
in contemporary U. S. politics, mainstream democratic theory offers few
resources for thinking about their actions in terms of citizenship. For
political theorists interested in democracy, however, the dissident
practices of Parks, Tillmon, and other activist women provide a rich
source for considering what it means to be an active, self-governed
citizen, and what it means to act together with others in a political
community.]{.underline} In this essay, I argue that [the dissenting
practices of these women point toward an expanded conception of
democratic]{.underline} Hypztiu vol. 12, no. 4 (Fall 1997) 0 by Holloway
Sparks Holloway Sparks 75 [citizenship that incorporates dissent,
recognizes courage as central to democratic action, and reclaims and
revalues the courageous dissident practices of women
activist]{.underline}s. Although feminist historians and social
movements scholars have recently devoted a great deal of attention to
women's activism (see e.g., Crawford et al., 1990; West and Blumberg
1990; Laslett et al., 1995), this work has had little impact on
democratic theorists. Part of the reason for this inattention, as a
number of feminist theorists have noted, is [the tendency of democratic
theorists to ignore the public activities of women]{.underline}
(Ackelsberg 1988; Pateman 1989; Evans 1993). An additional reason is
[the deliberative and discursive focus of much contemporary democratic
theory. Recent controversies about citizenship have primarily centered
on the role of citizen deliberation in democracies]{.underline}.
Participatory theorists, such as Carole Pateman, Benjamin Barber, Jane
Mansbridge, Iris Marion Young, and theorists drawing from the work of
Hannah Arendt and Jurgen Habermas have generated a lively debate about
[the promise and possibilities of reconceptualizing and
institutionalizing citizen deliberation in a wider variety of public
spaces.]{.underline} Citizenship, however, involves more than
deliberation. Deliberation, however critical as a practice, is often the
goal rather than the starting point for those who engage in dissident
citizenship. I [conceptualize dissident citizenship as the practices of
marginalized citizens who publicly contest prevailing arrangements of
power by means of oppositional democratic practices that augment or
replace institutionalized channels of democratic opposition when those
channels are inadequate or unavailable]{.underline}. Instead of voting,
lobbying, or petitioning, dissident citizens constitute alternative
public spaces through practices such as marches, protests, and picket
lines; sit-ins, slow-downs, and cleanups; speeches, strikes, and street
theater. [Dissident citizenship, in other words, encompasses the often
creative oppositional practices of citizens who, either by choice or
(much more commonly) by forced exclusion from the institutionalized
means of opposition, contest current arrangements of power from the
margins of the polity]{.underline}. While dissident citizens can be
progressive or conservative, civil rights activists or segregationists,
pro-choice or pro-life, environmentalists or smokers' rights advocates,
they share a commitment to unconventional forms of democratic engagement
and opposition that nonetheless preserve the possibility of ongoing
debate and disagreement. Consequently, [if democratic citizenship is
ultimately about "the collective and participatory engagement of
citizens in the determination of the affairs of their
community'']{.underline} (Dietz 1987, 14[), then marginalized dissident
citizens who address the wider polity in order to change minds,
challenge practices, or even reconstitute the very boundaries of the
political itself engage in a form of democratic citizenship that is
essential for the continuing revitalization of democratic
life]{.underline}. 76 Hypatia [A crucial element in the practice of
dissident citizenship]{.underline}, I wish to argue[, is the discourse
and practice of courag]{.underline}e. One way to describe courage is as
a commitment to resolution and persistence in the face of risk,
uncertainty, or fear. Because of its strong association with the
behavior of soldiers, courage has often been constructed as a
quintessentially masculine trait, tied intimately to conceptions of
manhood and to the performance of violence (see esp. Brown 1988). But as
the examples at the beginning of this essay demonstrate, women are
perfectly capable of acting resolutely in the face of risk, uncertainty,
and fear, even though they are much less likely to be credited as
courageous actors. A courageous act, moreover, need not be a violent
one. It is commonly believed and well documented, for example, that
nonviolent resistance activities, protests, and communication with
opponents can require courage, especially in the face of verbal abuse,
threatened incarceration, or the possibility of physical violence. Civil
rights Freedom Riders who responded to mob attacks with nonviolence in
the summer of 1961, for example, clearly practiced courage while
resisting segregation in the American South. A less well developed
perspective is that communication, connection, and dialogue with allies
and potential allies can require the practice of courage as well. For
example, Audre Lorde speaks of the courage feminists have needed to
confront racism within their own groups. Women of color have practiced
courage by breaking the silence about racism; white women have practiced
courage by not turning away from the painful recognition of their own
racist practices. By courageously confronting racism, Lorde argues,
feminists have strengthened their alliances (Lorde 1984b). [Like
resistance activities, these connection and coalition activities are
important dimensions of the practice of dissident citizenship. In both
cases, discourses and practices of courage shape political engagement
and action, even under conditions of uncertainty and especially in
contexts where dissident citizens face domination and
oppression]{.underline}. Although contemporary democratic theory offers
little guidance for considering the role of courage in democratic life,
attending to the way that conceptions of courage are used to shape and
mediate dissent allows us to explore the ways that dissident citizenship
itself is negotiated and performed. Exploring courage will also draw
attention to how dissident citizenship is constructed and negotiated in
gendered, raced, and classed terms. In this essay, I construct an
account of dissident citizenship that includes attention to political
courage and that offers an approach for exploring the dissident
practices of women. Drawing on feminist theorizing about oppositional
citizenship, multidisciplinary work on women's activism, and activist
accounts of dissent, I argue for a conception of citizenship that
recognizes both dissent and an ethic of political courage as vital
elements of democratic participation. After briefly exploring a case
study of women's activism, I conclude with some reflections on what this
approach offers to democratic theorists and others interested in women's
citizenship and public activities. Holloway Sparks 77 CONTEMPORARY
PERSPECTIVES ON CITIZENSHIP [To understand how dissent has fallen
through the cracks of much mainstream democratic theory, it is helpful
to review how that theory conceptualizes citizenship and the role of
conflict in democratic life]{.underline}. In the liberal democratic
tradition of political thought, conflict between citizens is expected
and institutionalized. As exemplified in the work of theorists such as
John Rawls (1971,1985), Ronald Dworkin (1978), and Robert Nozick (1974),
this tradition conceives of citizens as legitimately self-interested
individuals who have agreed (contracted) to respect each other's
individual liberty and interests.' Governments are charged with
enforcing this respect, and should provide enough protection and
regulation to preserve individuals' abilities to pursue their diverse
interests and ends, especially in the marketplace. But because citizens
also need protection from powerful governments, certain activities and
spaces are withdrawn from legitimate public interference and are
protected as "rights." Furthermore, citizens are granted an additional
check on their government by way of regular elections. [Politics,
according to this view, is the process of resolving the inevitable
conflicts and disputes that will result when citizens pursue their
interests and their individual conceptions of the good
life.]{.underline} These conflicts, however, will be resolved by
representatives, not by citizens themselves. Citizens who "lose" in a
conflict, furthermore, are expected to respect the decision, even if
they begin the institutionalized process of disagreement again. [Under
the liberal democratic view of political life, in sum, conflict is a
given but is tamed by established institutional forms of
expression]{.underline}. As Mary Dietz has observed, 'This vision of the
citizen as the bearer of rights, democracy as the capitalist market
society, and politics as representative government is precisely what
makes liberalism, despite its admirable and vital insistence on the
values of individual freedom and equality, seem so politically barren to
so many of its critics" (Dietz 1987, 5-6). Communitarian theorists such
as Michael Sandel (1982, 1984) and Alasdair MacIntyre (1981), for
example, find the liberal vision of suspicious, self-interested,
isolated citizens tremendously impoverished. In Sandel's view, "we
cannot be wholly unencumbered \[liberal\] subjects of possession,
individuated in advance and given prior to our ends" (Sandel 1984, 166).
He and MacIntyre insist instead on the "embeddedness" of individuals
(and therefore citizens) in their communities. In contrast to the
liberal celebration of individual rights and self-interest,
communitarians claim that what is in the interest of an individual is
inextricably tied to what is good for a community as a whole: ["my
identity is not independent of my aims and attachments, but partly
constituted by them; I am situated from the start, embedded in a history
which locates me among others, and implicates my good in the good of the
communities whose stories I share"]{.underline} (Sandel 1984, 9).
Citizenship thus becomes the project of cooperatively 78 Hypatia seeking
the good for a community, as a community, rather than as self -
interested individuals. In the "local forms of community" that
communitarians favor, conflict-r at least serious conflict-seems to
disappear. The "central bond" of a communitarian community, MacIntyre
argues, is "a shared vision of and understanding of goods" (MacIntyre
1981,258). This shared vision, along with attention to traditions and to
one's history and roles, provide guidance for community interactions
that ideally embody "civility" (MacIntyre 1981, 263) and, one gathers, a
high degree of consensus. In a community where values and a sense of the
common good are shared, citizens are not adversaries, as liberal
democrats would have us believe, but something closer to friends or
perhaps even relatives. Unlike the liberal democratic view, which leaves
immutable conflict at the heart of public life, communitarians suggest
that citizen concern for the common good makes cooperation flourish and
conflict disappear. Recent participatory theorists join the
communitarians in finding the liberal conception of citizenship too
limited and adversarial, yet propose a quite different vision of human
living together in response. Drawing on traditions and sources as
diverse as Greek political thought, Italian Renaissance civic
republicanism, the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Alexis de
Tocqueville, the American pragmatists, and Hannah Arendt, contemporary
participatory theorists have argued for a conception of citizenship that
puts citizen action and self-government at the center of political life
(Pateman 1970; Mansbridge 1980; Barber 1984; Dietz 1987; Habermas 1989;
Young 1990; Fraser 1992). It is only through the active participation of
citizens, these theorists argue, that democracy becomes legitimate: "Men
and women who are not directly responsible through common deliberation,
common decision, and common action for the policies that determine their
common lives together are not really free at all, however much they
enjoy security, private rights, and freedom from interference" (Barber
1984, 145-46). Citizenship in a participatory democracy, therefore,
requires significant participation in common institutions of
self-government, institutions "designed to facilitate ongoing civic
participation in agenda-setting, deliberation, legislation, and policy
implementation (in the form of 'common work')" (Barber 1984,151). These
participatory institutions, by transforming strangers into
citizen-neighbors through common conversations and projects, enable
citizens to envision and articulate "a common future in terms of
genuinely common goods'' (Barber 1984, 197). And as Benjamin Barber
argues in Strong Democracy, this common vision need not be purchased by
suppressing conflict or by sacrificing individual interests. Conflict
and disagreement, Barber insists, can instead be transformed by citizen
deliberation and action. Participatory politics deals with public
disputes and conflicts of interest by subjecting them to a never-ending
process of delib- Holloway Sparks 79 eration, decision, and action. . .
. In such communities, public ends are neither extrapolated from
absolutes nor "discovered" in a preexisting "hidden consensus." They are
literally forged through the act of public participation, created
through common deliberation and common action and the effect that
deliberation and action have on interests, which change shape and
direction when subjected to these participatory processes. (Barber
1984,151-52) Unlike the liberal democratic vision of citizenship, which
views conflict as something merely to be tolerated or managed, conflict
in a participatory democracy becomes an occasion for learning and for
actively creating consensus where none existed before.2 Citizens learn,
through democratic interaction with other citizens, how to enlarge their
vision of their own freedom and interests to include others (Barber
1984, 232). The result is a form of democratic life, Barber argues, that
respects both individual and mutual purposes. Barber's vision of
participatory democracy, although powerful, has been challenged
persuasively by other participatory theorists. These theorists are
critical (sometimes intensely so) of Barber's failure to recognize
deep-seated inequalities that affect participation and interaction in
public life. As an example, some theorists flatly reject Barber's case
for putting political equality before economic equality, and for
assuming that common talk and common action can take place in the
presence of the systematic inequalities produced under capitalism.
Herbert Bowles and Samuel Gintis, for instance, present a compelling
argument for why the economy must be subject to democratic
accountability in a society that values equality and participation
(Bowles and Gintis 1986). In a similar vein, Richard Flacks has argued
recently that democratic societies must discover ways to democratically
control the movement and impact of global capital while simultaneously
creating more participatory economic institutions and practices (Flacks
1996). Meaningful political participation, these theorists insist,
requires some sort of substantive economic equality (Fraser 1992,
118-21). In addition, Iris Marion Young has criticized Barber's
inattention to the deep-seated inequalities produced by the cultural
imperialism practiced by dominant social groups. Cultural imperialism,
in Young's view, is "the universalization of a dominant group's
experience and culture, and its establishment as the norm" (1990,59).
Although she supports Barber's vision of a democratic society where all
people participate in public discussion and decision making, Young takes
Barber to task for defining the public realm as one in which social and
cultural differences must be "submerged" in favor of apparently neutral
deliberation about "the common good." In Barber's strong democracy,
Young observes, "The pursuit of particular interests, the pressing of
the claims of 80 Hypatia particular groups, all must take place within a
framework of community and common vision established by the public
realm" (1990, 117). This is problematic because dominant groups have the
power to "project their own experiences as representative of humanity as
such" (1990, 59). Public discussions framed in terms of community,
common vision, and unity, "as opposed to group affinity and particular
need and interest," Young argues, consequently privilege the voices and
perspectives of dominant groups who "dominate the allegedly common
public" (1990, 117). Any legitimate public conflict, consequently, is
precluded by a fraudulent consensus. (See also Mansbridge 1980; 1990,
127.) Although she respects Barber's desire to counter the liberal
vision of atomistic, self-interested individuals, Young argues that it
is not necessary to replace that vision with a falsely homogenizing
"ideal of community." Instead, Young supports the creation of what she
terms "a heterogeneous public." The repoliticization of public life does
not require the creation of a unified public realm in which citizens
leave behind their particular group affiliations, histories, and needs
to discuss a mythical "common good.'' In a society differentiated by
social groups, occupations, political positions, differences of
privilege and oppression, regions, and so on, the perception of anything
like a common good can only be an outcome of public interaction that
expresses rather than submerges particularities. . . . Indeed, in open
and accessible public spaces and forums, one should expect to encounter
and hear from those who are different, whose social perspectives,
experience, and affiliations are different. To promote a politics of
inclusion, then, participatory democrats must promote the ideal of a
heterogeneous public, in which persons stand forth with their
differences acknowledged and respected, though perhaps not completely
understood by others. (Young 1990,119) Citizenship, in Young's
heterogeneous public, thus takes the form of participation in public
discussion and decision making, but in an institutional context that
"equalizes the ability of oppressed groups to speak and be heard" (1990,
189). Institutional mechanisms and public resources should support group
representation by providing for the self-organization of oppressed
groups, the group generation and analysis of policy proposals, and group
veto power regarding specific policies (1990, 184). Group
representation, Young concludes, prevents oppression, draws conflict
into the open, and provides all social groups with the resources for
meaningful participation in joint agenda setting, deliberation,
decision, and a\~tion.\~ Although Young does not confine the principles
of group representation to representative bodies in government settings,
clearly her proposal has an Holloway Sparks 81 institutional focus. All
her examples are decision making bodies; the "democratized publics'' she
talks about are institutional ones. While both Barber and Young have
considered ways to expand democracy within current institutions,
democratic theorists drawing from the work of Jiirgen Habermas have
drawn attention to an additional realm of participation, what Habermas
and others have called "the public sphere." The public sphere, in Nancy
Fraser's words, designates a theater in modern societies in which
political participation is enacted through the medium of talk. It is the
space in which citizens deliberate about their common affairs, and hence
an institutionalized arena of discursive interaction. This arena is
conceptually distinct from the state; it is a site for the production
and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the
state. The public sphere in Habermas's sense is also conceptually
distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market
relations but rather one of discursive relations, a theater for debating
and deliberating rather than for buying and selling. (Fraser 1992,
110-11) In recent years, theorists drawing on the notion of the ideal
public sphere have defended a conception of democracy variously termed
"deliberative democracy," "proceduralist-deliberative democracy,"
"discursive democracy," or "communicative democracy." (See esp. Habermas
1987 and 1989; Dryzek 1990; Fishkin 1991; Joshua Cohen 1989; Mansbridge
1992; Benhabib 1996a.) Deliberative theorists join the participatory
theorists in advocating significant political participation and "the
widest-reaching democratization of decision making processes" possible,
but they expand the focus on political participation to "a more
inclusively understood concept of discursive will formation" (Benhabib
1992'86). In the words of Seyla Benhabib, [under the deliberative
conception of democracy, participation is seen not as an activity only
possible in a narrowly defined political realm but as an activity that
can be realized in the social and cultural spheres as well]{.underline}.
Participating in a citizen's initiative to clean up a polluted harbor is
no less political than debating in cultural journals the pejorative
presentation of certain groups in terms of stereotypical images
(combating sexism and racism in the media). (Benhabib 1992,86)
Citizenship in a deliberative democracy, consequently, means
participating in "the determination of norms of action through the
practical debate of all affected by them" (Benhabib 1992,86). The
precise rules that should govern the practical debate are a matter of
some dispute (see, e.g., Habermas 1996; Joshua Cohen 1996; Young 1996)'
but this more expansive notion of partici- 82 Hypatia pation as talk and
deliberation in a variety of settings, Benhabib claims, "articulates a
vision of the political true to the realities of complex, modem
societies" (Benhabib 1992,86).4

### 2NC -- Ext - Body Ptx First

#### The personal is political -- critiques offer important world views on how structures demarcate violence and are important to teaching debaters how to engage in real world change.

**Gehrke 98** (Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy
Analysis: Policy Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate, 19, 18-39.)

Implications of Critiques as Policy Analysis These two views of
**[critique arguments]{.underline}** \-- critiques as policy criteria
and critiques as interpretive policy analysis \-- **[expand our
conceptions of policy debate by demonstrating the roles of critiques in
policy discourse.]{.underline}** Some may find the implications of these
views uncomfortable. Policy analysis critiques should not replace all
other theories of critique argumentation or methods of policy analysis.
Rather, this theory expands the ways that we can think about and discuss
policies. Any debater, theorist, coach, or critic who advocates a policy
fOCllS has little theoretical basis from which to exclude critique
argumentation from their decision making process. The further one
entrenches oneself in the policy literature the more necessary critiques
become. Time is always at a premium in debate rounds, and debaters may
already feel they are dealing with too many issues. However, we should
remember that there was a time when debates moved, in general, much
slower and included a justification of decision criteria in the
affirmative case in addition to the requisite policy evaluation.
Constrained by time, some debates will focus more on policy
instrumentalities, some more on competing values, and\" some more on
communicative implications. This is simply a reflection of the fact that
**[the art of policy analysis \"lies in realizing when inadequate data
or social values other than efficiency make the narrow benefit-cost
approach inappropriate\"]{.underline}** (Weimer and Vining 311).
**[Critiques enhance our current model of policy discourse and can
improve our ability to perform policy evaluation and
advocacy.]{.underline}** A caveat here must be that viewing critiques as
a dimension of policy analysis does not seem to provide a model from
which we may comfortably evaluate arguments that critique the policy
focus. Arguments that question the project of policy making may be
ill-suited to the perspective of critiques as policy analysis. We should
not indict or reject critiques that we can not frame as policy analysis.
Rather, these positions simply must ground their relationship to policy
advocacy in something other than the models outlined here. However, the
vast majority of critiques do not break with the assumption that we are
debating about what we should do. **[Whether one critiques patriarchy,
statism, legal objectivism, modernism, essentialist ontology, democracy,
capitalism, or a host of other subjects, these arguments most often
attempt to shape our actions \-- our personal, social, and political
policies.]{.underline}** Repositioning critiques within the realm of
policy analysis provides an opportunity to overturn some common
assumptions about critiques found in claims made by both proponents and
opponents of critique argumentation. Perhaps most disturbing to some is
that incorporating critiques into policy analysis revokes their status
as a priori issues. However, we should resist so privileging any
argument form. Placing critiques before all other arguments generates a
structure that stultifies and stagnates the critical investigation of
issues. Instead, we should place specific arguments in contingent
hierarchies for the purpose of evaluation in a particular debate.
Critiques are additional methodologies for discussing our shared world
and shared action \-- the realm of policy debate. Hence, the
implications of a particular critique for a particular decision should
be grounded in the particular arguments advanced in that particular
debate. Accepting critiques as a part of policy analysis may help us to
redefine the relationship between debate and politics. **[Even the most
radically esoteric critique arguments may be deeply political, and
positioning critiques as policy analysis asks us to think of ourselves
as policy analysts and policy makers]{.underline}**. This very
proposition politicizes debate and revives the reality of the debate
forum. **[Thinking of debate and critiques as policy advocacy, policy
analysis, and pol icy making explodes the distinction between debate and
the \"real world\" by erasing the fictionality of debate rounds. Once
debaters and critics recognize themselves as real citizen/policy makers
rather than imagined governmental bodies, they will find it more
difficult to exclude values, ethics, and morals from their
decisions]{.underline}**. Critique opponents may argue this personalizes
the politics of debate, making decisions more arbitrary or dependent
upon a critic\'s subjective value system. We might more accurately say
that it uncovers politics. If the policy theorists and. analysts
discussed here are correct, then the rationalist model is no less
political or personal; rationalism merely denies and masks its political
and personal biases. In attempting to maintain the rationalist position,
a body of value hierarchies and epistemological assumptions are enforced
as given truths. Toppling the hegemony of the rationalist paradigm has
the \' pleasant side effect of unmasking the non-rational and emotional
bases for decisions made under the guise of the rationalist model.
Debaters and critics will need to struggle with how these issues can be
adjudicated in a debate round. Considering critiques as substantive
issues removes the easy hierarchy of issues that gave critique arguments
their trump status, and will require that critics and debaters develop
more sophisticated practices of comparison and evaluation. Non-policy
theorists such as Zarefsky may provide some guidance, but much work will
have to be done in the debate rounds. For value critiques, debaters
might advance both a criteria for the adjudication of the issues at
hand, and a value hierarchy that helps to place the competing values in
the debate in relation to one another. Language and advocacy arguments
might be advanced as substantive issues in a debate when a team argues
that the critic, as a citizen/policy maker, should not specifically
endorse the other team\'s advocacy. This could be as philosophical as a
moral obligation to not engage in or endorse particular communicative
behaviors, or as instrumental as a discussion of the implications of
advocacy for policy implementation and interpretation. Executive and
judicial bodies often interpret policies based upon the advocacy that
advanced them. This is especially apparent in judicial attempts to
interpret international treaties (Bederman 972-976; Koh 343). Solt may
have provided grounds for language and advocacy arguments as substantive
issues within the policy frame: \"**[If language is so abused that the
integrity of the debate process has been undermined, then it probably
should be a voting issue]{.underline}**\" (\"Demystifying\" A I 0). If a
citizen/policy maker feels that the language choices have impeded
effective GEHRKE 35 consideration of the issues, they may opt simply to
reject the proposal of the offending party. Solt\'s argument against
critiques is that such abuses are uncommon in debate. This is not a
criticism of the theoretical legitimacy of language critiques, but
rather questions the common practice of relying upon tenuous links
between arguments. **[Ethics violations or critiques]{.underline}** that
are equivalent to \"calling fouls\" in the debate \"game\" **[could also
be reconsidered as substantive reasons why a citizen should not endorse
a particular advocacy]{.underline}**. **[Ethics violations question the
reliability and character of the debaters, as weIl as all of their
arg·umentation. Politically these are powerful arguments. In debate, we
often remove them from the realm of debatable propositions in favor of
having critics or tournament administrators adjudicate them
independently. In politics they are openly discussed and debated and
result in political ramifications for propositions, policies, and
advocates long before any judicial body mandates criminal or civil
penalty. If one can adequately convince a citizen/policy maker that an
advocate of a proposition is lying, it is unlikely that the
citizen/policy maker wiIl entertain many of the arguments of that
advocate.]{.underline}** Of course, reconsidering critiques as policy
analysis is not an unassailable proposition, and it may be subject to
criticism for its focus on academic policy literature. The theorists
discussed here include policy analysts and advocates from the RAND
Corporation and the Cato Institute, and a variety of policy analysis
educators and scholars. Their work does not comprise the entirety of
perspectives on policy analysis, and there are many in the policy field
who take issue with their positions. However, Dan Durning and Will Osuna
do provide a quantitative analysis of the perspectives of working policy
analysts. They conclude not only that most policy analysts are not
objective technicians, but also that the majority of policy analysts
recognize that no policy problem has a single right solution.
AdditionaIly, the majority of analysts do not believe that a single
unified theory of policy analysis can explain or solve all policy
situations (649). It could also be claimed that the model of critiques
as policy analysis is unrealistic in terms of what a policy analyst must
do, which is to convince a client to foIlow their advice. While the
rational policy model may manifest hegemony in academic debate, such is
not always the case in policy analysis. Consider some advice from Weimer
and Vining: \"Sometimes doing good simply requires analysts to advise
their clients to forgo some current popularity or success to achieve
some important value. You are doing exceptionaIly well when you can
convince your client to accept such advice\" (408). 36 CONTEMPORARY
ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE Just as Weimer and Vining seek to ensure that
the training of policy analysts considers perspectives other than policy
rationalism, so must we as debate educators and critics ask ourselves if
**[limiting academic debate to a rationalist perspective pays too high a
price in the values it sacrifices and messages it sends.]{.underline}**
**[If policy debate is to train better citizens and political activists,
then we must consider the inclusion of value arguments critical to this
education.]{.underline}** Political deliberation rarely relies solely
upon instrumental rationality. Even given the tendency of some policy
analysts to take a predominantly instrumental perspective, the inclusion
of nonnative value claims is prerequisite to a meaningful and compelling
justification or dejustification of a policy. Policy rationalism fails
for the same reason Brownlee and Crossman specifically indicted
cost-benefit analysis: \"In the attempt to replace consent with reason,
\[it\] typically omits vital steps in the debate over values\" (I).
Arguments focused upon value systems are a much-needed corrective to the
weaknesses of the rationalist policy paradigm (Anderson 31). **[In
academic debate, it is critical that the training and experience of the
students, coaches, and critics include the consideration and evaluation
of competing value claims.]{.underline}** Value conflicts are
increasingly central to politics in the United States. Brownlee and
Crossman note that conflicts between constituencies over regulatory or
redistributive policies are usually centered around \"the absence of a
common set of value priorities\" (I). **[If debaters, after spending
hundreds of hours in the activity, are left with the impression that
decision making only entails considerations of instrumentalities within
the bounds of fonnal rules or ethical guides, academic debate will be
responsible for proliferating amoral and value ignorant policy
advocates, and citizens who are ill-equipped to cope with the valueladen
issues of contemporary politics.]{.underline}**

[For all the talk about]{.underline} the Israel Lobby this and [Jewish
Power that, the clearest takeaway from this whole ordeal is the striking
disempowerment of the Jewish community. Spoken about and spoken over,
the Jewish community is being **systematically stripped of our ability

"represented," if you can call it that,]{.underline} by Glenn Greenwald
on the one side and Lee Zeldin on the other (surely, [this is the
definition of Jewish hell]{.underline}), both of whose elevated stature
in public discourse about Jews is almost exclusively a feature of
gentile, not Jewish, interests. Indeed, in a real way, Omar's
conservative critics and progressive defenders stand in a symbiotic
relationship: They are united in their desire to silence the message
most Jews want to send. The right insists on condemning the Democratic
Party and any progressive conversation about Israel as institutionally
anti-Semitic, [never mind that most Jews are committed Democrats and
often share the progressive critique of Israel's rightward drift that
Republicans are so eager to tar]{.underline}. Many of Omar's progressive
defenders, for their part, are happy to simply dismiss all talk of
left-wing anti-Semitism as conservative agitprop; they are content to
rely on the usual assortment of fringe voices who -- so long as Israel
is on the docket -- will offer to kasher even the clearest instances of
anti-Semitic discourse. It makes for a crushing feeling of
powerlessness. [The nation is having a conversation about Jews virtually
impervious to the input of Jews themselves. This, above all else, is
what makes so many Jews want to scream in frustration. **The right
loudly proclaims it's standing up to anti-Semitism** -- but Jews know
their 24/7 Omar coverage does us no favors, and that in any event,
conservative solidarity with Jews runs out precisely at the point it
requires challenging the sort of **anti-Semitic conspiracy mongering
that gets Jews shot.** The left self-righteously insists that it is
saving its ammunition for combating the "real anti-Semitism" -- but Jews
have long seen that for too much of the left, cases of "real
anti-Semitism" beyond the most obvious murderous varieties seem almost
as elusive as O.J.'s "real killer." Both sides are silencing Jews in the
guise of allyship. Both sides need to step back and knock it
off.]{.underline}

#### The political hides sheltered through acts of antisemitism as cities refuse to recognize the violence, systematically silencing what's happening. The political has gotten smarter - instead of obvious forms of Nazi violence and oppression, it prefers a new, systematic form of exclusion through the media and state. The political has adapted to resistance - people started identifying it after ww2 simply because it made itself too obvious. The same cities in which windows are filled with signs saying 'never again', are the cities in which Jews realize that the only recognition of anti-sematic violence will always be the holocaust - that's exactly what the political wants, the political wants us to focus on the obvious forms of Jewish violence in the past so we can ignore that our people silently dying in the status quo

Nancy Mairs, a self-described crip, writes, ["The fact that **the
soundness of the body** so **often serves as a metaphor for moral
health, its deterioration thus implying moral degeneracy,** puts me and
my kind in a quandary. How can I possibly be
'good**'**]{.underline}?"---a statement of shame if ever there were one
(1996, 57). [It is, of course, medical discourse we usually turn to in
order to decide which bodies are sound and even what bodily soundness
is, and the reliability of this discourse is seldom questioned.
**Disability** as presently constructed in the United States **manifests
itself as a central deﬁning characteristic of a personhood that is
rendered less than ideal**]{.underline} (Gauthier 1983; Wilkerson 1998,
88--93). This lesser status appears to be incontestable because it is
medically certiﬁed, with medical evidence regarded as utterly objective,
detached from values, emotions, and particular human interests. Yet
**[neither medical fatalism nor medical relegation of some to a lesser
status or a life without sexuality is fully deterministic in the end,
nor are other oppressive cultural norms]{.underline}**. Alternative
possibilities for politics and pleasures are being imagined and enacted
individually and collectively. Often, it has been noted, after all, that
being regarded as outside the norm gives one less stake in upholding it,
particularly when it turns out to be punitive, unjust---or impossible.
And when one experiences a break with the past, as in the case of those
who are suddenly disabled, the loss of "how things used to be," though
undeniably traumatic, can sometimes open the door to new possibilities.
For example, some (although not all) of the participants in Elle
Becker's early study of women with spinal cord injury report eventually
becoming more sexually assertive after their injury, due to the need to
actively reconstruct their sexual desires and practices, rather than
passively enact what they have been led to expect of themselves and
their partners (1978). Nondisabled women have much to learn from these
responses to an extremely challenging circumstance, just as everyone can
learn more from paraplegics and quadriplegics about the extensive
possibilities of human sexualities that depart from heterocentric and
phallocentric norms. If these arguments have been convincing, [**the
political importance of overcoming shame will be quite clear.** There
are many ways to try to overcome or avoid shame, **and perhaps one of
the most common involves bids for respectability,** but as Warner warns
us, this strategy poses signiﬁcant risks for queers. Perhaps
respectability poses similar dangers for feminism.]{.underline} [If the
"ofﬁcial queer movement" is pursuing respectability through marriage and
thereby solidifying the outsider status of those who don't jump on the
marriage bandwagon, national feminist organizations may be pursuing the
same illusory and problematic goal when they defend "reproductive
choice" as the right to avoid unwanted pregnancy, while failing to
defend women's right to sexual pleasure]{.underline}. Warner argues that
**[an accessible sexual culture is necessary for sexual
autonomy]{.underline}**. Bartky warns of the harms to women of what
might be called a patriarchal sexual monoculture. Their arguments
suggest that **[we must attend to the material conditions which make it
possible to access sexual culture and work to transform those which make
it unimaginable.]{.underline}** We must consider, for example, the war
against terrorism upheld as protecting American lives and helping to
liberate Afghan women, while they and other women are allowed to die all
over the world in childbirth or from unsafe abortions. President Bush is
currently withholding \$34 million in congressionally approved funds to
the United Nations Population Fund because of false allegations that the
money could be used to promote abortions. This could jeopardize delivery
of supplies to Afghan women, since the Fund provides "clean underwear,
sanitary napkins, and sterile delivery kits---soap, a string, and a
clean razor blade" (Cocco 2002). **[Overcoming shame and undermining the
moral inﬂuence of medicine]{.underline}** (which comes not only from
direct pronouncements and omissions but also from its cultural status as
a source of knowledge and order) **[will require the creation of
powerful counter-discourses]{.underline}**. One resource for these are
the experiences of creating new pleasures which disabled people
exemplify, or the speciﬁc forms of resistance to sexual viliﬁcation or
victimization which other groups have demonstrated. **[This task of
constructing counter-discourses has been central to the women's health,
disability rights, LGBT]{.underline}** (lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender[)**, and AIDS movements.**]{.underline} I believe [**it**
will become increasingly recognized as **strategic for other social
change movements** as well, **and must be understood as fundamental to
the struggle for sexual democracy**, which in turn must be recognized as
a vital and necessary component of all struggles for democracy and
inclusion.]{.underline} But [**in order for individuals and groups to
succeed in fostering their own sexual agency,** they must seek and in
some measure gain others' mutual recognition and respect, which are not
primarily psychological or attitudinal, although attitudes are
important; **they are more broadly political.**]{.underline} In other
words, [**the success of counterdiscourses requires not only that they
persuade others, but that they act in solidarity.** Audre Lorde asked us
to imagine "an army of one-breasted women descend\[ing\] upon
Congress"]{.underline} (1980, 16). We might imagine diverse groups
struggling together for sexual democracy. [What if NWSA sat in with
ADAPT at the American Medical Association for medical support for

### 2NC -- Ext - Discourse First 

#### Critical arguments are necessary in debate to hold debaters accountable for their discourse and the potentially violent implications and impacts such discourse can have. 

**Gehrke 98** Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy
Analysis: Policy Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate, 19, 18-39./

While critique arguments were once rare in academic debates, today they
are part of nearly every debater\'s experience. Contemporary debates
frequently grapple with arguments that indict or advance values, systems
of knowledge, and language choices. It is difficult to know whether this
growing popularity is due to advances in critique theory, a growing
dissatisfaction with traditional models of policy debate, or the
competitive success of critiques in debate. What is apparent in debate
literature and discussion is that a substantial amount of controversy
still exists about the saliency of critiques to academic policy debate.
Some policy debate advocates claim there is no place for critiques in
the comparison of policy options, while advocates of critiques often
consider such arguments broader than a policy perspective, arguing that
**[critics should consider critiques before resolving policy
questions.]{.underline}** Whether one subscribes to Roger Solt\'s view
that \"the kritik is on balance bad for debate\" (Anti-Kritik ii) or
William Shanahan\'s view that \"kritiks allow debate access to another
of its fundamental assumptions\" (AS), it is clear that at least for the
near future **[critiques will playa major role in the practice of
academic policy debate.]{.underline}** At this point, the controversy
over critique argumentation is at an impasse. Both sides of this
controversy marginalize critique arguments by positioning them outside
of policy deliberation. The predominate notion among both supporters and
opponents of critiques is that they are argued as a sidebar to the
policy debate. While I am sympathetic to, and often agree with, the
philosophical potential envisioned by those who endorse critique
arguments, their reasoning often fails to address the questions raised
by those who doubt the role of critiques in policy debate. We cannot
transcend these differences without repositioning the relationship
between critique arguments and policy deliberation. This essay contends
that meaningful policy evaluation often includes arguments similar to
those labeled \"critiques\" in academic debate. Specifically, it argues
that **[critique arguments, rather than serving as a priori or
tangential issues, are relevant dimensions of policy analysis and should
be treated as substantive issues in policy debate]{.underline}**. The
idea that the issues raised by critique arguments are relevant to the
substance of policy disputes is consistent with arguments made by
innovative policy analysts and policy scholars. Many policy theorists
argue for including in the policy discussion process arguments that
mirror certain forms of critique argumentation. This position may seem
unusual, given that some debate theorists tend to believe that policy
analysis excludes critique arguments However, a considerable body of
policy studies literature clearly supports the inclusion of critiques
based upon competing value orientations and critiques based upon the
communicative aspects of the policy process. The Status of Critique
Arguments in Academic Debate In contemporary academic debate, critique
arguments encompass a wide range of philosophical issues. Shanahan
originally focused on the German existential philosopher Martin
Heidegger\'s call to explore how we think about being in the world. This
continental pedigree gave rise to the commonly used German spelling,
kritik. Shanahan contends that **[traditional policy debate \"functions
on a foundation of unquestioned assumptions]{.underline}**\" (A4). He
calls for debaters to advance arguments that can uncover and investigate
these assumptions. Shanahan holds that **[the focus ought not be on the
results of such a questioning, but rather that the process of thinking
and questioning itself is to be valued]{.underline}** (A4). Since
Shanahan, debaters have expanded critiques from their existential
origins to include a broad diversity of philosophical and political
perspectives. Recent critiques have been based on Riane Eisler\'s
feminist anthropology, Herbert Marcuse\'s theory of repressive
desublimation, Immanuel Kant\'s categorical imperative, and Ayn Rand\'s
objectivism. A second origin of critique argumentation is Kenneth
Broda-Bahm\' s theory of the language-linked value objection, or
\"language critique.\" Broda-Bahrn **[indicts academic debate for
operating under the assumption that language is transparent and purely
referential]{.underline}**. He uses Ludwig Wittgenstein\' s theory of
language games to argue that **[words and their use have effects, and
that critics should consider objections to certain language choices when
adjudicating debates]{.underline}**. As originally conceived, the
language-linked value objection focused \"more directly on the actual
language practices of an opponent\" (Bahrn 69). Broda-Bahm gives
**[language critiques]{.underline}** primacy as voting issues because
they **[make claims to immediate and tangible impacts that \"uniquely
happen as a direct result of our advocacy]{.underline}**\" (Bahm 76).
More recently, theorists and debaters have fashioned critiques involving
such diverse arguments as evidence challenges, morality arguments, and
objections to particular styles of delivery (Berube, \"Kritiks\"). For
the purposes of this essay, critiques conveniently may be divided into
three argument forms: value critiques, epistemology critiques, and
language critiques. This classification system is relatively common in
critique literature. David Berube refers to ideational (value), thinking
(epistemology), and language critiques (\"Criticizing\" 68). Solt
separates critiques into practical philosophical critiques (value), pure
philosophical critiques (epistemology), and language critiques
(Anti-Kritik ii-vii). While these \..... \"I . · t. : \....
classification schemes are neither universal nor comprehensive, they are
functional for \.... discussing the relationship between critique
argumentation and policy deliberation. **[Value critiques establish or
indict value systems or advance ethical or moral claims.]{.underline}**
These take the shape of deontological critiques, decision rules, value
hierarchies, ethics violations, and moral obligations. When an
affirmative claims a moral obligation to implement their policy, they
are advancing value arguments in an attempt to justify their policy
position. Likewise, these arguments are frequently advanced by negatives
contending that an affirmative\'s proposed policy is discriminatory
(i.e., racist, patriarchal, heterosexist, etc.) or morally unacceptable
as a COurse of action (such as the pacifist\'s opposition to committing
violent acts). Value critiques were the stock and trade of \"value\"
debate, usually referred to as criteria and value objections arguments
(Zarefsky IS). Epistemology critiques establish or indict means of
creating or finding truths. These include arguments such as Paul
Feyerabend\'s critique of scientific method and Murray Edelman\'s theory
of enemy construction. Epistemology critiques predominantly question the
reliability of particular methods of making predictive and descriptive
claims inherent in a particular policy advocacy**[. Every policy case
advances causal and predictive claims. These claims are each the result
of a particular way of coming to or creating knowledge, such as
laboratory study, romantic introspection, field research, or humanist
investigation. Epistemology critiques indict a method of coming to or
creating knowledge, thus undercutting the claims derived through that
method]{.underline}**. The best of these critiques will also advance an
alternative knowledge system that produces results contrary to the
claims advanced in the opponent\'s positions. GEHRKE 21 Language
critiques can be differentiated from value and epistemology critiques in
two respects. First, they focus upon communicative or interpretive
aspects of either particular word choices or the broader advocacy of
debaters. **[Language critiques indict what an advocate communicates,
intentionally or otherwise, and what others who endorse that advocacy
might communicate]{.underline}**. Debaters have called these arguments
language-linked value objections, language objections, language
critiques, advocacy critiques, advocacy-linked disadvantages, and a host
of other names. Second, **[the most controversial element that
differentiates these arguments from other objections to policy advocacy
is the claim that their implications supersede the impacts of particular
policy actions]{.underline}**. Advocates of language critiques often
claim fiat to be illusory, that language creates reality, or that
advocacy has \"real-world\" or \"in-round\" effects upon critics,
debaters, and others. For example, a language critique might argue that
an opponent has employed sexist language, such as using \"mankind\" as
an androgynous term. The team advancing the critique may argue that a
critic who fails to reject the sexist language likewise advocates using
sexist language, and consequently perpetuates and reinforces sexism in
the culture. Conversely, the policy issues debated are only fictions or
imaginations used to simulate a policy decision in the debate. In
actuality, **[when the critic votes, no policy is enacted.
Yet]{.underline}**, the critique proponents argue, **[the effects of the
language are real and immediate]{.underline}**. Thus, the debaters ask
the critic to ignore the illusory or imagined impacts of the proposed
policies and decide the debate based upon the real and immediate impacts
of language. Some critiques, such as Critical Race Theory, cross these
categories. Since Critical Race Theory indicts the American legal system
for being racist, which makes its predictive and descriptive claims
inaccurate, it combines a value critique and an epistemological
critique. Similarly, debaters sometimes combine value arguments with
language critiques to create a dual set of impacts for their positions.
With the sexism example previously discussed, the critiquing team may
add an argument that says that individuals have a moral obligation to
reject sexism when they encounter it. Thus, in addition to the language
critique of the use of the term \"mankind,\" the critiquing team would
also advance a value critique, holding that there is an obligation to
reject sexism. The distinctions between value, epistemology, and
language critiques are not always clean, and may leave out some critique
arguments. Critique argumentation is in a constant state of mutation as
debaters find new ways to think about particular issues. The
classification scheme used here should be considered functional only for
the purposes of this discussion. 22 CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND
DEBATE One of the primary CrIticisms leveled against all such critiques
is that they fail to address policy questions (Jinks A14; Shors and
Mancuso A15; Solt, Anti-Kritik xiii; Solt, \"DemystifYing\" A9).

#### Even if you like traditional policy debate, contemporary real world policy making requires looking into the assumptions behind the actions proposed, which is an analysis only critical debate can provide. 

**Gehrke 98** (Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy
Analysis: Policy Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate, 19, 18-39./cdc)

**[Most debate theorists who oppose critique arguments
advance]{.underline}** a rationalist paradigm of policy evaluation. In
their minds, a **[strict cost-benefit analysis, particularly a
quantitative analysis based on the preservation of human life, is the
only means by which an advocate can justifY or dejustifY a
policy]{.underline}**. In his criticism of scientific models of public
policy, Robert Formaini, the former vice president for public policy at
the Cato Institute, explains the rationalist policy paradigm: According
to the policy rationalist, if the risks are \"acceptable\" and the
\"benefits\" are greater than \"costs,\" what person can argue that the
proposed policy ought not be done, and on what inductive basis? It will
not work to say that the proposed policy is \"wrong,\" \"immoral,\"
\"unjust,\" and a \"waste of time and effort.\" These arguments are
\"unscientific\" and \"value-laden\" with the citizen\'s personal,
irrational prejudices. (69) **[In policy debate, the rationalist
perspective marginalizes critiques by mistakenly representing a
particular approach to policy evaluation as the essential means of
policy deliberation, implying that one theoretical perspective is both
appropriate for all policy questions and preferable to all other means
of policy comparison]{.underline}**. Marouf Hasian and Edward Panetta
argue that \"both the promise and the peril of the critique come from
its use as a method of questioning some of the assumptions behind
\'policy\' debate itself\' (47). They continue, \"the use of \'the
critique\' in policy debate means a virtual abandonment of many of the
cherished assumptions of policy decision making\" (53). If by policy
debate and policy decision making, Hasian and Panetta are referring only
to the conventional practices of academic debate, they would be correct.
However, their criticism is not that critiques simply challenge academic
policy debate as we commonly practice it, but rather that critiques are
\"politically irrelevant and counterproductive\" (54). This conclusion
is arrived at by giving primacy to rationalist policy models, including
claims such as that \"debating is an inherently rationalistic activity\"
(54). Faith in rationalism as the core element of policy debate leads
Derek Jinks to posit that if critiques have any theoretical legitimacy,
\"they should take the form of disadvantages, counterplans, solvency
arguments, etc.\" (AI4). links argues that resolutions imply the context
for academic debates, and since contemporary resolutions are interpreted
as policy questions, they should be addressed from a policy perspective
(AI2). While this line of reasoning may bear some merit, Jinks begs the
question of whether the rationalist model is the only possible policy
perspective. Jinks relies on a rationalist cost-benefit analysis model
for decision making. He argues that policy decisions cannot be made
without comparing unique costs and benefits of proposed courses of
action (A 14). Jinks likewise contends that policy debate should begin
from a set of shared assumptions about the values at stake, which should
simply be taken as true (Al3). Matthew Shors and Steve Mancuso propose
an extreme division between critiques and policy discourse. Shorsand
Mancuso make the same error as Jinks · by generalizing from rationalist
policy models to all policy deliberation. **[They claim that critiques
are \"utterly irrelevant\" and that critiques ask us to believe that
\"it is pointless to discuss policies]{.underline}**\" (A16). Shors and
Mancuso would have us believe that critiques \"ignore policy issues
altogether\" (A16). It is because critiques do not argue unique
commensurable costs or benefits that they contend that critiques carry
\"little, if any, weight in policy comparison\" (AI6). Only by failing
to recognize the broad diversity of policy perspectives can Shors and
Mancuso come to conclude that \"the Critique is wholly incompatible
with, and non-germane to, policy debate\" (A 17). Perhaps the most
vehement opponent of critiques has been Solt. Solt makes many of the
same assumptions about policy analysis as do Jinks, Shors, and Mancuso.
Solt so strongly believes that critiques challenge the assumption that
\"what we are essentially engaged in is a policy debate\" that he
recommends the first response to critiques be to reestablish the policy
framework (\"Demystifying\" A9). For Solt, \"the kl\'itik is a
non-policy argument\" (Anti-hitik ii). He sees debate as a policy forum,
and critiques are considered not to be \"germane to the subject at
hand\" (Anli-Kl\'itik xxii). Solt argues that \"at root, the kritik
misunderstands the nature of the policy calculus\" (Anti-Kritik x:xiii).
Solt\'s rationalist assumptions are apparent in arguments encouraging us
to \"take an a priori ethical and political framework for granted\"
(\"De mystifying\" A II). Similarly, **[he ignores a whole body of
interpretive and communicative policy analysis literature when he claims
that \"ideas are more important than the rhetoric with which they are
expressed]{.underline}**\" (\"Demystifying\" All). Here, Solt is
attempting to refute language critiques by retreating to a separation of
policies and the words that express, present, and form those policies.
For So It, the policy has a pure form outside of language, and it is
that form that is to be evaluated, rather than any of the words that
might malign it. Such a position is distant from much of both
contemporary communication studies and policy studies literature. 24
CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE **[The arguments against critiques
advanced by the policy debate rationalists are suspect because they are
grounded in the traditions of academic debate rather than contemporary
theories of policy studies. Consequently, they dismiss questions they
can not force-fit into policy rationalism as neither worthwhile nor
relevant to policy discussions]{.underline}**. As two policy analysts
wrote of the hegemony of the rationalist paradigm, \"When all you have
is a hammer the whole world looks like a nail\" (House and Shull
163-164). Berube attacks critiques from a perspective not overtly
founded on policy rationalism, holding that critiques are fundamentally
pre-fiat arguments and that they disregard post-fiat substantive claims
(\"Criticizing\" 68-72). Nonetheless, he bases his arguments upon
similar assumptions about the relationship between critiques and policy
debate. Here, \"fiat\" is a stand-in for \"policy focus,\" in that fiat
represents an enacted policy. **[To claim that critiques disregard
issues that arise after fiat is to claim that they disregard questions
raised by enacting policies]{.underline}**. Berube\'s argument is also
**[predicated upon the assumption that academic debate should extend no
further than \"intentional, intended, naIve, objective, and rogate\"
meanings]{.underline}** (\"Criticizing\" 77). **[This means that
debaters and critics should not question any of the assumptions or
presuppositions of texts or advocacies, uncritically accepting the
premises inherent in propositions.]{.underline}** In the context of
policy analysis, Berube \'s standards require that policy advocates and
analysts not ask of each other: \"But what are your assumptions? Are
they valid, or consistent, or morally acceptable?\" This position is
extraordinarily dangerous. Wayne Booth argues that we must consider
precisely those questions texts attempt to foreclose: Each literary work
implicates within itself a set of norms about what questions are
appropriate. Hemingway, to choose a favorite example of the new feminist
critics, does not demand of us that we ask of his works, \"Is it good
for men or women to accept uncritically my machismo bravado?\" Indeed,
he seems to work quite hard to prevent our asking such a question. But
surely, the feminist critics say, and I think they are right, surely any
teacher who teaches A Farewell to Arms without inviting, somewhere along
the line, a critical consideration of Hemingway\'s heroes as human
ideals, and of his portraits of women as reflecting a peculiarly maimed
creative vision, and of his vision of the good life as a singularly
immature one-surely any such teacher is doing only half the job. (301) .
. ; GEHRKE 25 . Similarly, we might say that **[any policy debater who
does not seek a critical consideration of the questions that a policy
proposal tries to foreclose is only doing half the job of a policy
analyst.]{.underline}** Additionally, Berube assumes that we have pure
and direct knowledge of the meanings of a text. However, **[in order to
understand the meanings of a text we must interpret that text. When
advocates speak, we inevitably interpret what they say. Meanings are
found in the act of interpretation, and those meanings differ, at least
slightly, between interpretations. There is virtually no text in a
debate that can inspire one universally agreed upon
interpretation]{.underline}**. As listeners and readers, we can never
find ourselves at a point where the intentional, naive, and rogate
meanings of a text are objectively transparent to us. Determining what
questions a text invites requires interpreting the text, and these
interpretations will vary, producing contrary readings of what questions
may be asked of that text. There is no way to reconcile interpretations
objectively. In order to evaluate competing interpretations, one would
have to engage in precisely the critical textual analysis Berube
attempts to foreclose. Since every interaction with a text is
interpretive, Berube\'s objective standard for encountering a text never
can be met. While opponents of critiques might be expected to position
critiques outside of policy discussion, some advocates of critique
arguments in debate have done the same. Many · critique proponents
advance either the position that we should not consider ourselves policy
analysts (Berube, \"Kritiks\" 21), or that critiques supersede policy
questions (Bahm 76; Broda-Bahm and Murphy 21). These arguments
unwittingly lend assistance to opponents of critiques by disconnecting
critique arguments from policy discourse. Stepping outside the policy
focus is not inviting to those who hold resolutely to a policy
perspective; rationalist or otherwise. Rather, it makes it all the more
difficult to recognize the unique role critique arguments can play in
the enhancement of policy analysis and policy debate. Broda-Bahm
probably has done more to popularize language critiques than any other
theorist, but he clearly positions these arguments outside of policy
deliberation. BrodaBahm and Thomas Murphy define a critique as \"any
argument which does not provide an answer to the resolutional question\"
(21). In this context, they refer to \"the resolutional question\" not
merely as the resolution itself, but as the affirmative case which
advocates it (31 n3). They make the same assumption often used as a
premise against critiques, that we can and should separate policies from
the language that advances them. Broda-Bahm separates policy and
language by arguing that critiques do not answer substantive advocacy,
but rather focus \"more directly on the actual language practices of an
opponent\" (Bahrn 69). This is reinforced with attempts to give primacy
to the \"more immediate and more tangible\" effects of language by
claiming policy proposals to be fictions of debate rounds (Bahm 76).
While positioning critiques outside of policy discourse is a common
error amongst critique advocates, Shanahan is an exception. Much of
Shanahan\'s essay is esoteric and philosophical, but he does recognize
at least a potential for critiques to be a part of policy analysis.
Making use of literature about development assistance, Shanahan
considers \"the possibility that the kritik is policy debate\" (A8).
Shanahan was nearest the mark when he claimed that \"the kritik
supplements, not supplants current debate practice\" (A4). However,
critique proponents have either ignored or simply reiterated these
claims, and opponents of critique argumentation scoff at Shanahan\'s
conception of policy analysis. Most likely, this is because Shanahan\'s
theory is so deeply embedded in Heidegger\'s philosophy that it is
difficult to read a policy focus beneath the existential vocabulary.
This may also be because neither proponents nor opponents of critique
argumentation have considered the policy studies literature that
reinforces the need for critiques in policy discussions. **[If one truly
takes a policy perspective toward debate, one inevitably finds that
critique argumentation is a necessary element of policy
evaluation]{.underline}**. The impasse hence arises because opponents of
critiques hold that the purpose of debate is to discuss policies
exclusively, and assume that policy rationalism is the only mechanism
debaters can use to do so. Many proponents of critiques maintain the
impasse by arguing that critiques somehow supersede or exist outside of
policy argumentation. The marginalization performed by both sides of
this controversy disconnects critique argumentation from politics,
policy deliberation, and real world debates. **[To move past the impasse
and integrate critique argumentation and policy deliberation, we must
reposition critiques within the spectrum of policy
analysis.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Ext -- Performative sociality 

#### Narratives are a pre-req to the process of law formation -- key to counterhegemonic forms of knowledge production 

**Wharton '16 (Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller,
Harvard University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture
and the Humanities 1--11, pp. 1-3, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).**

This commentary assesses the state of scholarship on law and narrative
and argues for a more holistic approach to the topic. **[Narrative and
law do not encounter each other accidentally but are ineluctably
intertwined. Law is a dominant narrative form in the modern world;
narrative suffuses]{.underline}** not just testimony but **[all legal
practice. We urge scholarship that recognizes law and narrative as part
of the same socio-cultural project of making the world.]{.underline}**
At the 2015 meeting of the Modern Language Association (MLA), we
organized a roundtable on "Desire for Narrative in Law and Literature."
We solicited work that explored the various ways in which **[law not
only engages narrative, but also seems to need narrative.]{.underline}**
In other words we took as granted that **[law]{.underline}**, as Peter
Brooks has argued, **["needs narratology," and sought to explore the
diverse narratives -- and thus the multiple narratological perspectives
-- that law demands.]{.underline}** Two articles in this commentary
section originally appeared in that panel. This comment introduces those
exciting contemporary approaches to law and narrative and reflects on
the scope of the topic and its persistent importance**[. Law takes
advantage of the entire range of rhetorical and representational
possibilities available to it as a narrative form.]{.underline}** The
law does not merely involve narration -- for example, in representing
the underlying reality from which judicial or regulatory decisions
emerge. Rather, **[law is narrative, its coherence dependent upon our
collective understanding of how stories make meaning by connecting
characters and events into histories both factual and
fictional.]{.underline}** Further, as a narrative form in its own right,
like the epic or the novel, **[the law exercises considerable influence
not only over how we read other narrative forms, but also over the
stories such forms are capable of telling.]{.underline}** The two
comments gathered here, along with the other material from the MLA
panel, demonstrate both the breadth and depth of new scholarship on law
and narrative and make a case for the centrality of the law and
narrative paradigm within literary and legal studies. In an influential
PMLA article assessing law and literature, Julie Stone Peters divides
the joint study of those subjects into three phases.2 First came
"humanism," which offered literature as the antidote to the technocratic
rigor of law and economics. "Hermeneutics," swept up in deconstruction
and other literary theory, "threatened to unmoor law from its
traditional interpretive bases" of textual interpretation.3 Last but not
least comes **[narrative]{.underline}**, which **[combined the former's
concern with human agency and the latter's awareness of a text's
multiple meanings.]{.underline}** A similar tripartite division defines
the general approaches to law and narrative. Although Peters lists
narrative third in the development of law and literature, narrative
actually features prominently in the contemporary field's ur-text, James
Boyd White's The Legal Imagination from 1973. In White's chapter on
narrative, the final section of his book, he notes that [narrative draws
together and summarizes his central concerns. He suggests there that
"the central act of the legal mind, of judge and lawyer alike, is this
conversion of the raw material of life -- of the actual experiences of
people and the thousands of ways they can be talked about -- into a
story that will claim to tell the truth in legal terms."]{.underline}4
Yet law and narrative did not truly come into its own until the late
1980s. White's concern with how the minds of jurists, litigants, and
other citizens narrate their lives and their understanding of law
features prominently in that first explosion of law and narrative
scholarship that critiqued the force of storytelling in legal cases.
Writers such as Richard Delgado and Robin West hoped **[attending to
narrative would give voice to the voiceless and offer perspectives that
critiqued the hegemony of laws usually narrated by and for dead white
men.]{.underline}** Introducing the influential 1989 Michigan Law Review
symposium on law and narrative, Kim Lane Scheppele noted **[that "what
almost all the writer]{.underline}**s \[in the symposium\] **[shared was
a concern with the point of view of outsiders, those whose perspectives
had been excluded in the law's construction of an official story for the
particular case."]{.underline}**5 As Peters later summarized, **[this
work claimed "a kind of postcritical real as a viable basis for legal
ethics."]{.underline}**6 As this movement of narrative jurisprudence
firmly established itself in the early 1990s, scholars shifted their
gaze from the stories that litigants tell and those that litigation
excludes to the stories embedded in judicial decision-making. "The
stories that theorists such as \[Oliver Wendell\] Holmes, \[Lon L.\]
Fuller, and \[Ronald\] Dworkin tell are not simply ornamental; they are
central to -- they even constitute -- each writer's conception of law,"
wrote Robin West in her critique of legal narrative. **["By reading
these jurisprudential stories systematically and critically as stories,
we may achieve a richer understanding of the philosophical arguments
those anecdotes are meant to convey.]{.underline}**"7 **[Such readings
seek out narratives that do not mark themselves as such, and thus expand
the scope of narrative studies in law.]{.underline}** The 1995
conference on "Narrative and Rhetoric in the Law" at Yale's Whitney
Humanities Center summarized some of the myriad ways in which scholars
had recognized narrative's centrality to law in the preceding decade or
so.

#### Performance activism allows for new roles and rules for bodies normally excluded 

**Friedman and Holzman 12** By Dan Friedman and Lois Holzman,
"Performing the World: The Emergence of Performance Activism")

The performance turn is widely acknowledged. [**The premise that all (or
much) of** human practices are performed, that humans, through
performance, function as the active social constructors of their world
is not only embodied in the discipline of performance studies, but has
become part of the dialogue in anthropology, linguistics, ethnography,
folklore, psychology, sociology, and history.]{.underline} What is
generally less recognized, both by scholars and by political activists
themselves, is the performance turn in social activism. **[The
corruption and collapse of the Communist revolutions]{.underline}** of
the 20^th^ Century have **[called into question]{.underline}** the value
of ideology (in particular) and cognition and knowledge (in general) to
provide [**a** way out of the developmental dead ends**---pervasive
poverty, constant warfare and violence, the rapidly expanding gaps in
wealth and opportunity---that appear to have trapped
humanity.**]{.underline} Acknowledging this, a growing number of
political and social activists, community and youth organizers,
progressive and critical educators and therapists, and others **[around
the globe have been turning to performance as a way of engaging social
problems, activating communities, and experimenting with new social and
political possibilities. This shift looks different in different
cultures and political environments.  Whatever the differences, however,
the performance shift is allowing social change activists in both modern
and traditional cultures to organize not around a set of ideas, an
ideology, but to create, through performance, something new with what
exists. In our view, the performance turn has the potential to be
socially and culturally transformative/revolutionary precisely because
performance, consciously practiced in daily life, is, by its nature, a
creative social activity that allows human beings to break out of old
roles and old rules.]{.underline}**

#### Sociologists note that through performance, humans develop beyond the norms of social activism, constantly re-defining what it means to be an activist. 

**Friedman and Hotzman 12** (Dan Friedman and Lois Holzman, "Performing
the World: The Emergence of Performance Activism", pgs. 8-9)

The other direction performative inquiry takes is relating to people as
performers by studying the human activity of performing in its endless
varieties and by creating opportunities for people to perform in new
ways. For example, there are practitioners who, recognizing the
emotional and social growth that occurs when people create together
theatrically on stage, use theatrical performance techniques in
non-theatrical settings to support the expression of people's creativity
and sociality in all areas of their lives. Included here are various
nontraditional therapies, including psychodrama, social constructionist,
collaborative and narrative approaches.\[i\] There are also educators
who have made this performance turn, becoming attentive to creativity as
*socially performed* and learning itself as a creative activity. Some
relate explicitly to teaching and learning as improvisational\[ii\] and
develop performatory practices of student-teacher engagement.\[iii\]  It
is this direction of performative psychology that was taken by the
community we the authors are part of. We became convinced that
performing in new ways is key to ongoing human development, and that
ongoing human development is a necessary bi-condition of global cultural
and political transformation.\[iv\]  Our unique brand of performance
activism links performance inextricably to human and community growth
and development. PTW was born as an organizing tactic of this community,
and so we now offer a brief intellectual history of its activities.This
community of activists began by working in the poorest communities of
New York City in the 1970s and has gone on to organize middle class and
wealthy people to work with us to support poor people to develop and
provide leadership to the process of positive social change, free of
government, corporate or university dependence.  This organizing has led
to, among many other things, the development of outside of school youth
programs, a theatre, a research and training center, social therapy
practices, independent electoral campaigns and organizations on a
national, and increasingly, international stage.\[v\] In the course of
nearly four decades of this work, we have come to an understanding of
performance as a transformative, developmental activity. [We understand
performance to be the universal human capacity to be both who we are and
who we are not at the same time.  It is this ability, we believe, that
allows human beings to develop beyond instinctual and socially patterned
behavior. This understanding of performance changes the very nature of
social change activism.]{.underline} * *In coming to this
understanding/practice of performance, our organizing experience was
enriched by both Newman's training in analytical philosophy, the
philosophy of science and the foundations of mathematics under the
mentorship of Donald Davidson at Stanford University, and Holzman's
training in developmental psychology, psycholinguistics and
cultural-historical activity theory (the latter as a post-doc researcher
at Michael Cole's Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition at
Rockefeller University)---and by the embrace by Newman, Holzman, et al
of the early methodological writings of Marx, the later writings of
Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the work of Soviet
psychologist Lev Vygotsky. From Marx we took his dialectical methodology
and insistence that human beings are not isolated individuals: ["As
society itself produces man as man, so it is produced by him. Activity
and mind are social in their content as well as in their origin: they
are social activity and social mind]{.underline}."\[vi\] Second, we took
from Marx that the transformation of the world and of ourselves as human
beings is one and the same task: "The coincidence of the changing of
circumstances and of human activity or self-changing can be conceived
and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice."\[vii\]
Revolutionary practice, we came to understand from Marx, is not so much
the organizing toward a specific goal as it is a new conception of
method, a conception of method that involves a unity of human beings and
the world we've created/are re-creating.\[viii\] From Wittgenstein, we
came to an understanding of the limitations of language, and by
extension, of ideology.  Wittgenstein, in his later work, created a
radically new method of doing philosophy, one without foundations,
premises, generalizations or abstractions.\[ix\] His work exposed "the
pathology" embedded in language and in accepted conceptions of language,
thoughts and emotions. These linguistic/philosophical pathologies
permeate everyday life and create intellectual-emotional muddles, as
people look for: causes, correspondences, rules, parallels,
generalities, theories, interpretations, explanations for our thoughts,
words and verbal deeds---even when we are not trying to or trying not
to! Getting out of these traps, we gradually concluded, required
something other than language.  It required performance.\[x\]

####  Performative scenarios are the best educational methods for real-world problems

**Gordon 98** (Rick Gordon, 7/29/18, "Balancing Real-World Problems with
Real-World Results", The Phi Delta Kappa, Vol. 79, No. 5 (Jan., 1998),
pp. 390-393, SZ)

Enthusiasm for real-world learning needs to be balanced with the
realities of real-world classrooms, Mr Gordon notes. [Through
thoughtfully designed authentic learning experiences, students can
develop the understandings, skills, and beliefs needed for
success]{.underline} in school and beyond. Mankind likes to think in
terms of extreme opposites. It is given to formulating its beliefs in
terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no inter mediate
possibilities.\' [AUTHENTIC learning, real-world problems,
constructivist class rooms, performance assessment. Engaging students in
\"authentic\" performance situations seems to be the latest wave to wash
over the schools. On the surface, this is a most appealing contrast to
the decontextualized, rote learning typified by \"traditional\"
education]{.underline}. As Jacqueline Brooks and Mar tin Brooks exclaim
in describing the bene fits of constructivist classrooms, \"[They free
students from the dreariness of fact-driven curriculum and allow them to
focus on ideas; they place in students\' hands the exhilarating power to
follow trails of interests, to make connections, to reformulate ideas,
and to reach unique conclusions.\"]{.underline}2 Without doubt, the
possibilities are great and the language lofty when addressing this
latest wave. As one who comes to this movement with long experience
engaging students in real-world problems, I feel that it is important to
warn against the all-too-familiar tendency in education to be enamored
with new ideas while losing sight of the grounded perspective needed to
make things work in real classrooms with real students. The program I
work with, Education by Design/Critical Skills (EBD/CS), pioneered
\"Learning by Real Problems\"\~ in the early 1980s. Directed to come up
with educational practices that would allow children to develop the
knowledge and skills needed for success in school and beyond, EBD/CS
originally focused exclusively on real-life problems. In six-week summer
institutes, teachers were [engaged in real world problems so that they
could directly experience the power of this mode of
learning.]{.underline} The response to this approach was consistent -
participants found it to be among the most compelling learning
experiences of their lives; they felt engaged, challenged, energized,
and overwhelmed. It was this last factor that proved most problematic.
How Realistic Is Real? Real-world problems, by their nature, are messy -
involving uncertainty, complexity, and nuanced judgment.3 These
characteristics tend to clash with the norms that are prevalent in most
schools. Real world problems often don\'t mesh well with mandated
curricula, textbooks, standardized tests, state standards, and the seven
period day. Teachers who actually tried using real-world problems with
their students tended to be those renegades who thrive on change and
risk-taking. A more typical response of institute participants was that,
while they found the summer experience invigorating, they were daunted
by the prospect of attempting to implement this approach in their class
rooms. Where would they find resources? How would they assess student
work? What would parents and administrators say? Finally, there was the
omnipresent concern about \"covering\" the curriculum and ensuring
students\' exposure to the content at the heart of a teacher\'s subject
area. For many teachers, real-life problems, despite their promise,
seemed incompatible with classroom realities. Stepping Back to Step
Forward As a program, we have stepped back from this solitary focus on
real-world problems to consider what are the essential elements of
\"authentic\" learning. What is it about real-life problems that make
them powerful and engaging, and how can this be re-created in an
environment, such as the classroom itself, that often has relatively
loose ties to the \"real world\"? Here is what we have found. 1.
[Authentic learning demands that students actively solve
problems]{.underline}. Life involves an ongoing series of problems to
solve, decisions to make, concepts to understand, and products to
produce. Whether it\'s a relatively simple matter of deciding what to
eat for breakfast or a more complex one such as figuring out how to
reduce pollution in one\'s community[, in life we make decisions and do
things that have concrete results]{.underline}. Very few of us do
worksheets. 2. In authentic learning situations, people work together.
There are not the artificial boundaries of what some call the
\"graveyard model of teaching\" (everyone in rows and dead). Students
move about, talk to one another, and are active both physically and
mentally. They find resources to help solve problems - whether they be
fellow students, books, or the Internet. The focus is not just on what
you have stored inside your head but on what you can actually do to
solve a problem using the resources around you. 3[. Authentic learning
situations simultaneously involve one\'s knowledge, skills, and
attitudes. In real-life situations, you use your organizational skills
to manage resources to make decisions about how to solve problems using
the knowledge you possess to produce a result that meets your
internalized sense of quality. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes are
developed in the context of actual work.]{.underline} 4. Authentic
learning is driven by \"essential knowledge\" that is meaningful to
students. Not every element of student work must be \"real,\" but
meaning for students entails seeing connections to the real world on
some level. This relevance is best ensured by tying student work to the
\"big\" questions, what Ernest Boyer called the \"human
commonalities.\"4 These questions get to the heart of our culture,
history, and future as they relate to the human life cycle; our command
of symbols; our understanding of the social web; our connection to
science, technology, and the natural world; and the interdependence of
community and the individual. Likewise, [attention to real-life skills,
such as decision making and problem solving, can link students\' work to
real-life experience]{.underline}. 5. In authentic learning
environments, activities are connected. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes
learned and employed in one context carry over to another. The
curriculum looks less like a compilation of discrete building blocks and
more like a continuous ascending spiral in which each experience builds
on previous ones as students increase their understanding and improve
their skills. 6. [In authentic learning situations, students publicly
exhibit their learning, and there are often real-life standards of
quality]{.underline}. Authentic problems don\'t generate scores on a
test. There is usually some authentic benchmark instead to which
students are accountable. For example, if students make a proposal to
the town council, the council responds and perhaps approves it. If
students are making a product - such as a poster, play, or mural - there
are models of excellence against which the product can be judged.
[Exhibiting one\'s work publicly places it up against these real world
standards of quality.]{.underline} [The purpose of listing these
features of authentic learning experiences is to make clear that they
are achievable in regular classroom settings]{.underline}. [While it may
be true that the most authentic context is the real world beyond the
school-yard fence, there are reasonable approximations that can be
created in the classroom to offer students the same level of engagement,
meaning, and learning on a consistent basis]{.underline}. Making
Learning Authentic [The framework that guides the creation of authentic
learning in all settings is the experiential learning cycle (ELC). This
model offers an approach to make \"smaller\" learning activities more
authentic and to make \"messier\" real-life problems more
focused.]{.underline} At the heart of the ELC are what we call
challenges or problems to solve, which are driven by desired outcomes -
what we want students to know, do, and be like (knowledge, skills, and
attitudes). To help make challenges accessible to teachers and students,
we categorize them on three levels of generally increasing authenticity,
complexity, uncertainty, and student self direction. 1. Academic
challenges. [These activities provide an entry point into authentic,
problem-based learning]{.underline}. An academic challenge is student
work structured as a problem arising directly from an area of study (see
sidebar, part 1). It is used primarily to promote greater understanding
of selected subject matter. The academic challenge is crafted by
transforming existing curricular material into a problem format.
Academic challenges tend to look fairly familiar to teachers and
students accustomed to traditional educational environments. They serve
as a useful access point for developing a capacity for actively con
structing learning, working collaboratively, targeting specific
outcomes, focusing on standards of quality, and grappling with essential
questions. 2. Scenario challenges. [These challenges cast students in
real-life roles and ask them to perform these roles in the context of a
reality-based or fictional scenario]{.underline} (see sidebar, part 2).
[The scenario challenge simulates many of the elements of the real world
as a way of working with existing curricular material.]{.underline}
[Students begin to see themselves in real-life roles as they develop the
knowledge and skills needed for success in school and
beyond]{.underline}. 3. [Real-life problems. These are actual problems
in need of real solutions by real people or organizations]{.underline}
(see sidebar, part 3[). They involve students directly and deeply in the
exploration of an area of study. And the solutions have the potential
for actual implementation at the class room, school, community,
regional, nation al, or global level. Through real-life problems,
students move outside the classroom, take action on issues, and have a
tangible impact in their communities]{.underline}. These assignments can
be powerful learning experiences, but pulling off more than one or two
of them a year seems to be beyond the resources (energy, time, and
money) of most teachers and schools. [Moreover, for students to succeed
with real-life problems, it helps if they have experience working in
collaborative problem-solving teams.]{.underline} The skills and
attitudes of collaborative problem solving are best developed through
coordinated work on problems of increasing complexity and uncertalnty
(such as academic and scenario challenges). The ELC includes both
student and teacher dimensions. The student phases of the cycle are
engagement, exhibition, and reflection. [First, students are engaged in
a problem that has been crafted by the teacher to target specific
knowledge, skills, and attitudes. This challenge, as do many real-life
problems, usually requires some concrete product as evidence of student
learning. During the engagement phase, students and teachers spend time
articulating standards, based on real-world models, for the quality of
the product]{.underline}. In the course of engagement, and in the
exhibition of this product, students demonstrate their learning. After
completion and exhibition of their products, the students are not
\"done\" with their learning. Students participate in the reflection
phase, in which they examine their work and reflect on what they have
learned (reinforcing and constructing knowledge and considering their
personal and interpersonal behaviors). Students may then join the
teacher in assessment of their work based on their pre-established
standards of quality. The teacher-led phases of the cycle are design,
coaching, and feedback. Once the students have begun work on the problem
that has been carefully designed by the teacher to target specific
knowledge, skills, and attitudes, the teacher assumes the role of coach.
As coach, he or she helps students to develop their skills and
knowledge, shape their strategies, and find ap propriate resources. Like
a coach, however, the teacher remains on the sidelines at times,
allowing students to own their successes and failures. Here, the
students are truly the workers, and the quality of their work reflects
their efforts. [In the feedback phase, teachers create structures with
in which students can reflect on and assess their products, processes,
and level of understanding.]{.underline} Finally, this learning
experience is connected to subsequent experiences as students move into
the housekeeping phase, in which they consider what they learned and
what they need in order to proceed. They articulate what they might do
better next time and address skills and knowledge they need to develop
further as they move on to other challenges. Notably, they also give
consideration to the status and needs of their learning community. [They
address issues that arose during their work and develop strategies for
future work to improve the learning of their community.]{.underline} In
short, the classroom is structured so that students are given a
meaningful con text for interdependent work throughout the learning
cycle. Purposes and processes are made explicit, and students understand
what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how it relates to work
in school and outside. Experiences are organized to build on one
another, so that, as we do in the real world, students can learn from
their successes and failures and carry these les sons with them to their
future work. Most important, the work of the classroom consistently
demands that students authentically exhibit their knowledge, skills, and
attitudes throughout the learning cycle instead of only during a
scheduled performance. Bridging School And the Real World Authentic
learning is a laudable goal that should be promoted and pursued
vigorously. Students not only should see their work in school related to
the real world but must see it that way, if they are to be able to apply
their learning in real-life con texts. As we pursue this goal, however,
our experience warns us to remain grounded in the realities of
teachers\' and students\' school lives. Working with real-life problems
is a sophisticated process that demands refined skills and a tolerance
for ambiguity and complexity. While only some teachers and students have
an innate capacity for such undertakings, almost all teachers and
students can develop such capacity. Designing challenges to develop the
understandings, skills, and beliefs necessary to be successful with
real-life problems involves a commitment to authentic learning
experiences of increasing sophistication. The experiential learning
cycle and the combination of academic, scenario, and real-life
challenges provides a blueprint to connect the vision of real-world
learning to the realization of authentic student results.

### 2NC -- Ext -- Narrativization/Story Telling 

#### Story telling is key to combat objective v. subjective knowledge. 

#### **Delgado 89**, Richard Delgado, Storytelling for Oppositionists and Others: A Plea for Narrative, 87 MICH. L. REV. 2411 (1989) \[hereinafter Oppositionists\]; Pierre Schlag, Normative and Nowhere To Go, 43 STAN. L. REV. 167 (1990); EC

[Underlying these stylized debates about subjective versus objective
standards is a well-hidden issue of cultural powe**r, one neatly
concealed by elaborate arguments that predictably invoke predictable
\"principle.\"**]{.underline}**2 5 These arguments invite us to take
sides for or against abstract values that lie on either side of a
well-worn analytical divide, having remarkably little to do with what is
at stake. [The arguments mystify and sidetrack, rendering us helpless in
the face of powerful repeat players like corporations, human
experimenters, actiort-loving surgeons, and sexually aggressive
men.]{.underline}26 How does this happen? [Notice that in many cases it
is the stronger party-the tobacco company, surgeon, or male date-that
wants to apply an objective standard to a key event.2 7 The doctor wants
the law to require disclosure only of the risks and benefits the average
patient would find material.28 The male partygoer wants the law to
ignore the woman\'s subjective thoughts in favor of her outward
manifestations]{.underline}.2 9 The tobacco company wants the warning on
the package to be a stopper. Generally, the law complies. What explains
the stronger party\'s preference for an objective approach, and the
other\'s demand for a more personalized one? It is not that one approach
is more principled, more just, or even more likely to produce a certain
result than the other. Rather, in my opinion, [the answer lies in issues
of power and culture. It is now almost a commonplace that we construct
the social world.30 We do this through stories, narratives, myths, and
symbols-by using tools that create images, categories, and pictures.3 1
Over time, through repetition, the dominant stories seem to become true
and natural, and are accepted as \"the way things are.\"32 Recently,
outsider jurisprudence33 has been developing means, principally
\"counterstorytelling,\" to displace or overturn these comfortable
majoritarian myths and narratives.]{.underline}3 4 A well-told
counterstory can jar or displace the dominant account.35 [The debate on
objective and subjective standards touches on these issues of
world-making and the social construction of reality]{.underline}.
Powerful actors, such as tobacco companies and male dates, want
objective standards applied to them simply because these standards
always, and already, reflect them and their culture. These actors have
been in power; their subjectivity long ago was deemed \"objective\" and
imposed on the world.3 6 Now their ideas about meaning, action, and
fairness are built into our culture, into our view of malefemale,
doctor-patient, and manufacturer-consumer relations.**

#### Narratives threaten the hegemonic nature of the state- keeping a singular narrative of the state is key to cohesion 

**Wharton '16 (Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller,
Harvard University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture
and the Humanities 1--11, pp. 3-5, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).**

With contributors ranging from Martha Minow and Catherine McKinnon to
Elaine Scarry and John Hollander, the volume on Law's Stories produced
from that conference probed legal narrative as a political force, as
constructed in trials, as confession or victim impact statement, and as
it appeared in judicial opinions.8 So rich had the dialogue about
narrative become that when Richard Posner revised his heavily critical
monograph Law & Literature in 1998, he devoted an entire chapter to
narrative, a subject that did not merit an index entry a decade
earlier.9 Peter Brooks, one of the editors of the Yale conference
volume, developed a robust critique of law's persistent repression of
narrative. Brooks argued that **[the law resists narratology because
narrative fundamentally threatens law's hermeticism. "Law's suspicion of
narrative \[reveals\] its implicit awareness that in certain cases
letting narrative breach the bar of repression would risk a veritable
deconstruction of all the legal argumentation -- a massive housewrecking
of judicial rhetoric-as-usual,"]{.underline}** Brooks writes.10 For
instance, Brooks suggests that Fourth Amendment **[jurisprudence about
"inevitable discovery" exemptions to the exclusionary rule reveal how
the law relies on "retrospectivity" to justify its
outcomes.]{.underline}** In such examples the known result of an
otherwise illicit search structures the narrative courts hypothesize in
determining the forbidden item's discovery "inevitable" and thus
permissible[. A proper understanding of how narrative structures itself
around endings might]{.underline}, in Brooks' view, [reshape such
tendencies in Fourth Amendment law]{.underline}. Whatever the utopian
desires implicit in Brooks' analysis, **[narrative here clearly means
more than only testimony or confession]{.underline}** (on which Brooks
has also written extensively).11 **[Narrative exists in more than the
stories told in the courtroom or summarized in judicial opinions:
narrative suffuses all of legal practice.]{.underline}** Bernard S.
Jackson had made precisely this argument in his 1988 book, Law, Fact,
and Narrative Coherence. Jackson, writing from a Greimasian semiotic
perspective, urged that we read not only the explicit narratives related
at trial, but also the narratives of the trial itself. The latter, the
"story of the trial," as distinguished from the "story (told) in the
trial," "is as much subject to the constraints of narrative coherence as
is" the former, Jackson writes.12 Jackson calls his analytic method the
"narrativisation of pragmatics," in which the actions of the trial's
participants meet our demands for narrative coherence as fully as must
the competing narratives offered by the trial's opposing parties. The
trial process itself is a complex of pragmatic interactions each one of
which individually, and all of which collectively, are themselves
discursive constructions, their very intelligibility depending upon
their character as such. For not only is the "evidence" judged in the
light of narrative frameworks of typical social action; the behaviour of
participants -- and particularly the lawyers -- is judged in the light
of narrative frameworks of typical legal action: how counsel behaves in
a particular context, how the judge behaves, how the jury behaves,
etc.13 **[By recognizing narrative as fundamental to humans'
understanding of the world]{.underline}**, Jackson sees **[that we
narrativize every aspect of the law, not only those that we might name
"stories." Three major intertwining strands thus thread through law and
narrative.]{.underline}** The first strand concerns itself with
storytelling such as in witness testimony, asking questions about who
speaks and what stories get told. The second strand considers how legal
opinions narrativize their own logic and tidy the narratives presented
as evidence. And the third (and seemingly least developed) strand
considers narratives of the law that constrain and define the
possibilities of legal practice. In any of those forms, **[narrative
suffuses law because law is a human activity that, like all other human
endeavors, we narrativize so as to make comprehensible.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Ext - Activism General

#### Youth activism empowers people disenfranchised by poverty 

**Ballard and Ozard 16** (Jahromi) Ballard, Parissa & Ozer, Emily.
(2016). Implications of Youth Activism for Health and Well-Being.)

Youth activism and adolescent health. Adolescent health is
multi-dimensional. **[For our purpose of linking youth activism with
health and well-being, we are concerned with three aspects of adolescent
health: mental health and psychological well-being, physical health, and
health behaviors. As described further below, activism has been linked
with indicators of mental health such as self-esteem, empowerment, and
self-confidence.]{.underline}** Volunteerism has been linked to physical
health among adolescents, bringing up the intriguing possibility that
**[certain types of engagement with communities can promote physical
health]{.underline}**, although there is not yet evidence 4 linking
activism and physical health. Finally, **[activism aims to provide youth
with a sense of purpose and a chance to make meaningful community
contributions, which can have implications for positive health
behaviors]{.underline}**. For these reasons, the review below includes
studies that focus on these three types of health and well-being
outcomes. There are troubling disparities in both adolescent health and
levels of youth civic engagement across socioeconomic and racial/ethnic
lines. On average**[, youth of color and adolescents from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds have poorer health status, measured by markers
such as disease (e.g., HIV/AIDS), some indicators of behavioral health
(homicide, dating violence, unintended pregnancies), as well as access
to health services]{.underline}** (National Association of Social
Workers, 2001; Newacheck, Hung, Park, Brindis, & Irwin, 2003). **[At the
same time, youth of color and adolescents from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds are presented with fewer opportunities for high quality
civic engagement (]{.underline}**Kahne & Middaugh, 2008; Levinson,
2010). We submit that **[these are not unrelated phenomena, but rather,
that the structural realities of socioeconomic hardship and the related
opportunity gaps in the US underlie both health and civic disparities.
Youth activism can provide a path for young people to lobby for
necessary structural changes that might improve community health, while
potentially experiencing health benefits of empowerment during the
process. Thus, youth activism has the dual potential to affect youth and
community health positively]{.underline}** (Ballard & Syme, 2015). Given
the theoretical importance of civic engagement for healthy adolescent
development and the disparities in youth civic participation, there has
been surprisingly little systematic research on the role of activism for
youth health and well-being. Although most youth researchers and
practitioners share an assumption that youth activism is beneficial for
youth, it is important to provide evidence supporting or challenging
this assumption. At a time when youth activism is on the rise as new
technologies enable new forms of activism (Kahne, Middaugh, & Allen,
2014), we ask: What does activism mean for healthy youth development?

### 2NC -- Ext -- Active Education

#### They only focus on creating change based on personal gain, not taking into account the experiences of those who will be affected by this change. Activist education is the best mode of debate -- it is inherently more inclusive and allows the state to be checked by its people.

**Young 01** (Iris Marion Young, "Activist Challenges to Deliberative
Democracy", pg. 675-678,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3072534.pdf?refreqid=search%3Acf3fd94d9aec2b5a5dd03705b742f9bc)

The deliberative democrat might claim that the stance of the activist is
unreasonable. Reasonable political engagement, on this account, consists
of the willingness to listen to those whom one believes is wrong, to
demand reasons from them, and to give arguments aimed at persuading them
to change their views. For the most part, the activist declines so to
engage persons he disagrees with. Rather than on reason, according to
this deliberative democrat, the activist relies on emotional appeal,
slogans, irony, and disruptive tactics to protest and make his claims.
It is common in the political life of many democracies thus to label an
activist stance unreasonable and even \"extremist.\" One can interpret
such blanket labeling itself as a power ploy whose function is to rule
out of bounds all claims that question something basic about existing
institutions and the terms in which they put political alternatives. It
is important, therefore, to consider the activist answer to the charge
of being an irrational extremist: it relies on far too narrow an
understanding of what is reasonable***.* [By \"reasonable\" here, I mean
having a sense of a range of alternatives in belief and action and
engaging in considered judgment in deciding among them. The reasonable
person thus is also able and willing to justify his or her claims and
actions to others. As I have constructed the stance of the activist, he
is principled and reasonable in this sense. He reflects on some of the
wrongs that come to people and nonhuman things and has an account of
some of the social causes of those wrongs that he believes are
alterable]{.underline}**. He considers alternative means for bringing
attention to those wrongs and calling on others to help redress them,
and he is usually quite prepared to justify the use of specific means on
specific occasions, both to his comrades and to others, such as
television reporter[*s.* **While his principles often lead him to
protest outside of or disrupt the meetings of powerful people with whom
he disagrees, one of his primary reasons for such protest is to make a
wider public aware of institutional wrongs and persuade that public to
join him in pressuring for change in the institutions.**]{.underline}
[While not deliberative, then, in the sense of engaging in orderly
reason giving, most activist political engagements aim to communicate
specific ideas to a wide public. They use slogans, humor, and irony to
do so because discursive arguments alone are not likely to command
attention or inspire action]{.underline}**.** In the real world of
politics, some nihilistic and destructive persons demonstrate and
protest from blind rage or because they get pleasure from destruction.
Such a nihilistic stance describes few activists, however; activists are
often more self-conscious than other political actors about having good
reasons for what they do and disciplining their fellows to follow rules
in their collective actions. The common rhetorical move of official
powers to paint all protest action with the tar of \"extremism\" should
be resisted by anyone committed to social justice and reasonable
communication. Now that the activist has answered the deliberative
democrat\'s suspicion that he is not worth talking to, we can hear his
criticism of deliberative recommendations for political engagement and
citizen virtue. I will present these challenges in four steps, giving
the deliberative democrat the opportunity to respond to each. Exhorting
citizens to engage in respectful argument with others they disagree with
is a fine recommendation for the ideal world that the deliberative
democrat theorizes, says the activist, where everyone is included and
the political equal of one another. This is not the real world of
politics, however, where powerful elites representing structurally
dominant social segments have significant influence over political
processes and decisions Deliberation sometimes occurs in this real
world. Officials and dignitaries meet all the time to hammer out
agreements. Their meetings are usually well organized with structured
procedures, and those who know the rules are often able to further their
objectives through them by presenting proposals and giving reasons for
them, which are considered and critically evaluated by the others, who
give their own reasons. **[Deliberation, the activist says, is an
activity of boardrooms and congressional committees and sometimes even
parliaments. Elites exert their power partly through managing
deliberative settings]{.underline}*.*** Among themselves [they engage in
debate about the policies that will sustain their power and further
their collective interests. Entrance]{.underline} into such deliberative
settings [is usually]{.underline} rather [tightly
controlled]{.underline}, **[and the interests of many affected by the
decisions made in them often receive no voice or
representation.]{.underline}** The proceedings of these meetings,
moreover, are often not open to general observation, and often they
leave no public record. Observers and members of the press come only by
invitation. Deliberation is primarily an activity of political elites
who treat one another with cordial respect and try to work out their
differences. Insofar as **[deliberation is exclusive in this way, and
insofar as the decisions reached in such deliberative bodies support and
perpetuate structural inequality]{.underline}** or otherwise have unjust
and harmful consequences, says the activist, then it is wrong to
prescribe deliberation for good citizens committed to furthering social
justice. [Under these circumstances of structural inequality and
exclusive power, good citizens should be protesting outside these
meetings, calling public attention to the assumptions made in them, the
control exercised, and the resulting limitations or wrongs of their
outcomes.]{.underline} They should use the power of shame and exposure
to pressure deliberators to widen their agenda and include attention to
more interests. As long as the proceedings exercise exclusive power for
the sake of the interests of elites and against the interests of most
citizens, then politically engaged citizens who care about justice and
environmental preservation are justified even in taking actions aimed at
preventing or disrupting the deliberations. Many of the thousands who
filled the streets of Seattle in December 1999, it seems to me, assumed
just this account of the relation between deliberation and protest.
Heads of state or other high officials came from all over the world to a
meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to deliberate and try to
agree on a new round of global trade rules. Protestors criticized the
meeting, and many thought it should simply be stopped. They protested
the exclusive methods of the WTO, that the proceedings of its commission
are closed, and that the Seattle meeting itself was not public. They
claimed that the WTO is a tool of transnational corporate power and that
its deliberations give little attention to the effects of the free trade
regime on average citizens, especially the world\'s poorest people. The
deliberations of the WTO are not legitimate, and the agenda of the
organization is morally wrong. As I write this, some of my fellow
citizens prepare to protest similar deliberations on agreement for free
trade in the Americas. Not only are the meetings exclusive, but even the
document they will discuss is not public. There is no alternative to
protest and disruption, the activist thinks, when decisions affecting so
many people are made by so few and almost in secret. The advocate of
deliberative democracy as a prescription for political processes and the
behavior of good citizens has an easy answer to this criticism of
deliberation. She agrees with many things the activist says. Insofar as
[the proceedings of elite meetings are exclusive and nonpublic, they are
not democratic, even if they are deliberative.]{.underline} The norms of
deliberative democracy call not only for discussion among parties who
use the force of argument alone and treat each other as equals. They
also require publicity, accountability, and inclusion.4 [**To be
democratically legitimate, policies and actions decided on by means of
deliberation ought to include representation of all affected interests
and perspectives.** The deliberations of such inclusively representative
bodies ought to be public in every way]{.underline}**.** The people who
speak and vote in such deliberative settings, finally, ought to be
accountable to their fellow citizens for their opinions and decisions.
The deliberative democrat will likely join the activist to protest
outside exclusive and private deliberations. She exhorts the activist to
join her call for deliberations whose proceedings are public,
accountable, and inclusive, and she allies with the activist in
regarding deliberative processes as illegitimate unless they meet these
conditions. She may consider [activist protest a healthy means of
deepening democracy, of creating open and inclusive settings of
deliberative democracy.]{.underline}

#### Activist Education Helps Social and Political Change

**Niblett 15** -- (Blair Niblett Ph.D. in Education, "Narrating activist
education: teachers' stories of affecting social and political change",
Lakehead University,
https://knowledgecommons.lakeheadu.ca/handle/2453/604)

The project was undertaken in order to gain a deeper understanding of
the conceptual and practical relationships between education and
activism. [Of particular concern is how teachers perceive this landscape
from social, cultural, political, and pedagogical
perspectives.]{.underline} Underpinning this research is a
presupposition that education has the potential to create a less
oppressive and more socially just world. Methodologically informed by
narrative inquiry, ten participants were interviewed using a
semi-‐structured interview format that encouraged story telling. The
approach to the interviews was based in an understanding of stories as
fluid and organic organisms. Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) notion of
concepts as rhizomes was helpful in theorizing this approach.
Participants were encouraged to share stories of their experiences as
activist educators, the transcripts of each were parsed for relevant
stories, following McCormack's (2000a, b) multiple lenses approach, and
then curated into an experience narrative for each participant. Three
meaningful rhizomes were discerned from the body of experience
narratives. [Analysis of stories indicated that activist education may
be understood as socially, politically, and pedagogically
oriented.]{.underline} Social elements have to do with human relations,
how people treat each other, and how they learn these ideas through
education. Political elements refer to normative dimensions of activism
and education: what decisions should be made in order to live well? Who
should be included in making these decisions, and who is excluded?
[Pedagogical elements reflect the importance of experiences as vehicles
for learning, and the potential for activism to be a source of rich
learning experiences.]{.underline} These three strands are not strictly
independent, but rather are intricately intertwined, and even
chameleonic at times; that is to say that activist education may be
social at one moment, but transform into something more political or
pedagogical at another moment according to the needs of the teachers and
students and the contexts in which they find themselves[. The findings
of this work are significant both for teachers who identify as activist
educators, teachers who do not immediately see themselves as activist
educators but who are interested in anti-‐oppressive and social justice
education, and others who are interested in social justice and
anti-‐oppressive education.]{.underline} The stories shared by the ten
participants in this research illustrate a broad range of activist
education approaches that range from simple and politically safe, to
complex and politically contentious. [Readers of the participants'
stories and accompanying theorizing have an opportunity to better
understand ways that education, as a process that changes students and
teachers, can play a role in social change both in schools and the
societies and cultures in which they are situated.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Ext - Activism in debate

#### Organized Debate Can Be a Tool For Activism -- But Not Without a Critical Self-Reflection of its Elitist Roots

**[High School debate is prized as an intellectual activity for
politically engaged young people.]{.underline}** Each tournament often
begins with a commencement speech by some important **[person or other
who makes the claim that those of us participating will be the future
leaders of the world.]{.underline}** Advertisements hung throughout high
schools tout the fact a that a numerous number of famous political
officials and academics have participated in some form of formal debate
education and competition and in fact, the claim is genuine. A large
number of important political and social leaders have indeed
participated in formal competitive debating when they were in high
school or college. For **[those who aren't as familiar with the
activity, it works like this: there a few different types of categories
of competitive debate ranging from individual to partner to
group]{.underline}** events with different focuses on policy making
skills, research, philosophical rhetoric, or presentation. Each month or
year, depending on the category of debate, the National Speech and
Debate Association assigns an official national topic often in the form
of a resolved clause. For the months of September and October the
resolution was "Resolved, The US Federal government ought to pay
reparations to African Americans." Competitors are then expected to come
up with both a pro and con position on the resolution and debate both
positions against other teams. Unsurprisingly, **[national level
competitive debate functions as a mirror microcosm of the greater
political climate of the United States. As future leaders of the world,
those who are able to compete in national-level competition are often
those who are affluent or come from wealthy schools. More
disconcertingly, those who win and do well, much like the real world,
are almost always wealthy white men.]{.underline}** Wealth plays a
significant determinant of success as debate is an often times
ridiculous expensive activity with many students paying up to a thousand
dollars a year to compete at national tournaments across the country**[.
Individual costs are only mitigated by large debate endowments that are
only usually seen in extremely wealthy schools.]{.underline}** Moreover,
there is an advantage to those whose families can afford to send their
children to debate camps over the summer with the cost of an average
debate camp ranging from 2,000 to over 5,000 dollars. There have been
some [efforts to equalize the playing field for those who can not afford
camps such as creating an open evidence project.]{.underline}
Originally, only those who were able to go to camp would have access to
curated files of evidence that were an unbeatable advantage in
competition. In the debate documentary Resolved director Greg Whiteley
follows around two different teams: one affluent and white the other
poor and black in which the differences and **[advantages posed by
wealth and perception lend to competitors. It is within this climate of
elitism and dated preference that thousands of wealthy white debaters
across the country were discussing the topic of African American
reparations.]{.underline}** Recently, Bryan Stevenson, author of Just
Mercy, came to UW Madison to speak on issues of racism within the
criminal justice system. Throughout his speech he focused his efforts on
conveying to the audience that proximity -- that is, getting close to
the problems you are passionate about -- is essential in building good
advocacy as an ally to disadvantaged communities. Within academia there
is a rift between, on the one hand, academics who theorize and write
**[scholarship regarding privilege and oppression, but are not directly
impacted by the oppression; and those who write from actual lived
experiences of oppression. High school debate is one of the earliest
forms of the former, the 'armchair activist.' Oftentimes, debaters value
a topic only to the extent that they can win a tournament and forget
that the advocacy they espouse can genuinely impact the communities they
talk about. Surely, this is not the case for every student who
participates in high school debate, however, it is true for the vast
majority. Debate is an extraordinarily valuable form of intellectual
engagement and is especially vital for young people to develop their
skills in rhetoric and argumentation.]{.underline}** However, as an
institution, unless there is a shift in the idea that competition is
more valuable than learning the skills to impact the real world, debate
will continue to simply be an application-boosting extracurricular that
won't make the world a better place.

**Debate is a key space for us to engage in discourse through its
accessibility to teach us how to engage in social and political
actions.**

An Inward Glance: A Response To Mitchell\'s Outward Activist Turn,\"
[[http://www.wfu.edu/Student-organizations/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Coverstone1995China.htm
  EC]{.underline}](http://www.wfu.edu/Student-organizations/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Coverstone1995China.htm)

Mitchell\'s argument underestimates the nature of academic debate in
three ways. [First, **debate trains students in the very skills required
for navigation in the public sphere of the information
age.**]{.underline} [In the past, political discourse was controlled by
those elements who controlled access to information.]{.underline} While
this basic reality will continue in the future, its essential features
will change[. **No longer will mere possession of information determine
control of political life**.]{.underline} Information is widely
available. For the first time in human history we face the prospect of
an entirely new threat. The risk of an information overload is already
shifting control of political discourse to superior information
managers. It is no longer possible to control political discourse by
limiting access to information. Instead, control belongs to those who
are capable of identifying and delivering bits of information to a
thirsty public. Mitchell calls this the \"desertification of the public
sphere.\" [The public senses a deep desire for the ability to manage the
information around them. Yet, they are unsure how to process and make
sense of it all. In this environment, snake charmers and charlatans
abound.]{.underline} The popularity of the evening news wanes as more
and more information becomes available. People realize that these half
hour glimpses at the news do not even come close to covering all
available information. They desperately want to select information for
themselves. So they watch CNN until they fall asleep. Gavel to gavel
coverage of political events assumes top spots on the Nielsen charts.
Desperate to decide for themselves, the public of the twenty-first
century drinks deeply from the well of information. When they are
finished, they find they are no more able to decide. Those who make
decisions are envied and glorified. **[Debate teaches individual
decision-making for the information age. No other academic activity
available today teaches people more about information gathering,
assessment, selection, and delivery. Most importantly, debate teaches
individuals how to make and defend their own decisions.]{.underline}**
Debate is the only academic activity that moves at the speed of the
information age. Time is required for individuals to achieve escape
velocity. Academic debate holds tremendous value as a space for
training. Mitchell\'s reflections are necessarily more accurate in his
own situation. Over a decade of debate has well positioned him to
participate actively and directly in the political process. Yet the
skills he has did not develop overnight. [Proper training requires time.
While there is a tremendous variation in the amount of training required
for effective navigation of the public sphere, the relative isolation of
academic debate is one of its virtues. **Instead of turning students of
debate immediately outward, we should be encouraging more to enter the
oasis. A thirsty public, drunk on the product of anyone who claims a
decision, needs to drink from the pool of decision-making skills.

**Activism in debate is key to opening discussion about the space and
empowering excluded voices in debate**

**Eisenberg  2012**

(Stephanie Esienberg "Speaking from the Margins: Negotiating barriers to
women's\
participation and success in policy debate" San Francisco State.)

Particular types of argument choices may affect the way participants
experience a debate round. For example, [debaters may experience some
pushback to some of the arguments they wish to speak about in debate,
especially if they are trying to integrating personal
experiences]{.underline} into their argument. For example, Akila
explains that [debaters tend to treat each other as if it is a race to
the bottom, where the ballot is the only thing that
matters]{.underline}. [Judy notes that this norm of the community to
place emphasis on competitive success allows people to justify arguments
that are reprehensible or "not okay."]{.underline} Akila highlights
several examples of teams who will justify racism, sexism and
imperialism as appropriate side effects of advocacies that claim to save
the lives of many people from potential nuclear war scenarios
constructed through a lens of political realism. Ivana notes that
externalized logic, large body counts and phallic weapons are privileged
over personal experience or "your own body." Akila feels that debaters
don't place an emphasis on trying to relate to one another, and feels
that debate isn't an alternative space where students are encouraged to
relate more ethically towards one another. Like Judy, Akila agrees [that
the atmosphere promotes an emphasis on competitive success that makes
debate feel like "warfare," a common masculine metaphor]{.underline}.
Akila shares: On a personal level, I spent time writing this poem to try
to convey to you what being a woman of color and an immigrant is like
under this year's topic which is immigration, but because of the way
that we are taught to socialize in a sort of militarized space that is
debate, that gets lost until it becomes some sort of arsenal or some
sort of weapon. My narrative is just a reason we should win because it
foregrounds experiences of immigrants...that's not a good way of
understanding why people put themselves in debates. People put
themselves in debates because debate needs to be less insular; it needs
to be less detached from the reality of what we talk about. While some
women experienced this as a barrier, others did not perceive specific
arguments as inherently gendered or as a roadblock to their
participation or success in debate. Even though Catherine adopts this
particular perspective, she has become more aware of language choices in
argumentation, and explains that she frequently hears rhetoric that
equates certain argument choices with weakness, such as comparing
arguments with rape or making comments such as "that's gay" or other.
These comparisons serve to reaffirm hegemonic masculinity, and Catherine
feels that this type of\
rhetoric is a distinct barrier to inclusion in debate. In order to
combat some of these barriers, women utilize argument choice itself as a
tactic. Ivana, for example, frequently deploys feminist arguments in
debate rounds. She notes that even though some men in the community find
it acceptable to speak more candidly  about women's bodies and sexual
experiences, it is perpetually taboo to speak about women's bodies in
debate rounds. Ivana deployed arguments related to women's menstruation
as one way to engage this dichotomy she is confronted with. Thomas
(2007) explains how the menstruation taboo in modern Western society is
"restricting Western women from full citizenship" (p. 76). Ivana's
decision to speak out in this public forum about women's menstruation
might be thought of as a tactic to confront this taboo while reclaiming
a sense of citizenship in the debate community or even in the round
itself. By [requiring both the judge to listen and the other team to
engage her discussion of menstruation, she can call for a questioning of
this simultaneous objectification and silencing of women while
establishing a space for her to feel engaged and empowered by her
argument.]{.underline} [Other women chose to approach these tensions by
using personal experience as evidence, sharing their own stories in
debate rounds. Davis (2007) argues that "women's subjective accounts of
their experiences and how they affect their everyday practices need to
be linked to a critical interrogation of the cultural discourses,
institutional arrangements, and geopolitical contexts in which these
accounts are invariably embedded" (p.133) This is precisely what these
women are doing, weaving their own narratives in with theoretical texts
and political events situated while acknowledging the particular
institutional space the activity is located in.]{.underline} Lucille
doesn't feel that she uses tactics in debate rounds very often to
overcome these barriers, however she notes that there are instances
where enough was enough and she spoke about her subjectivity as a woman.
[Several women noted that being able to speak about being a female or
femininity in general while also remaining strategic and successful was
an empowering tactic. Akila calls these types of tactics "little
disruptions," or subversive instances in debate that challenge their
competitors and judges to a moment of reflexivity.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Ext -- Impact Framing

#### Structural Violence is worse than nuclear war. Extinction is now.

**Abu-Jamal 98** - (Mumia Abu-Jamal is a political activist and
journalist who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1982
for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner.)

It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as
shown by the thousands of cases of social and communal violence that
occurs daily in the nation. Every year, some 20,000 people are killed by
others, and additional 20,000 folks kill themselves. Add to this the
nonlethal violence that Americans daily inflict on each other, and we
begin to see the tracings of a nation immersed in a fever of violence.
But, as remarkable, and harrowing as this level and degree of violence
is, it is, by far, not the most violent features of living in the midst
of the American empire. [We live]{.underline}, equally immersed, and to
a deeper degree, [in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging
\"structural\' violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a
breathtaking ruthlessness.]{.underline} Former Massachusetts prison
official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; By \"structural
violence\" I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered
by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those
who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably
large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and
that structure is itself a product of society\'s collective human
choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the
society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting \"structural\" with
\"behavioral violence\" by which I mean the non-natural deaths and
injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals
against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide,
suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on.
\--(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New
York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) [This form of violence]{.underline}, [not
covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected
media, is invisible to us]{.underline} [and because of its invisibility,
all the more insidious.]{.underline} How dangerous is it\--really?
Gilligan notes: [\[E\]very fifteen years]{.underline}, on the average,
[as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a
nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths]{.underline}; and [every
single year]{.underline}, [two to three times as many people die from
poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the
Jews over a six-year period]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}, in
effect, [the equivalent of an]{.underline} ongoing,
[unending]{.underline}, in fact [accelerating]{.underline},
[thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every
decade, throughout the world.]{.underline} \[Gilligan, p. 196\] Worse
still, [in a]{.underline} thoroughly [capitalist society]{.underline},
much of [that violence became internalized]{.underline}, [turned back on
the Self]{.underline}, [because]{.underline}, in a society based on the
priority of wealth, [those who own nothing are taught to loathe
themselves]{.underline}, as if something is inherently wrong with
themselves, instead of the social order that promotes this
self-loathing. [This intense self-hatred was often manifested in
familial violence]{.underline} as when the husband beats the wife, the
wife smacks the son, and the kids fight each other. [This]{.underline}
vicious, [circular]{.underline}, and invisible [violence]{.underline},
[unacknowledged by the corporate media, uncriticized in substandard
educational systems,]{.underline} and un- understood by the very folks
who suffer in its grips, [feeds on the]{.underline} spectacular and
[more common forms of violence]{.underline} that the system makes damn
sure -that we can recognize and must react to it. [This fatal and
systematic violence may be called The War on the Poor]{.underline}. [It
is found in every country]{.underline}, submerged beneath the sands of
history, [buried]{.underline}, [yet ever present, as omnipotent as
death]{.underline}. In the struggles over the commons in Europe, when
the peasants struggled and lost their battles for their commonal lands
(a precursor to similar struggles throughout Africa and the Americas),
this violence was sanctified, by church and crown, as the \'Divine Right
of Kings\' to the spoils of class battle. Scholars Frances Fox-Piven and
Richard A Cloward wrote, in The New Class War (Pantheon, 1982/1985):
They did not lose because landowners were immune to burning and
preaching and rioting. They lost because the usurpations of owners were
regularly defended by the legal authority and the armed force of the
state. [It was the state that imposed increased taxes or enforced the
payment of increased rents]{.underline}, and evicted or jailed those who
could not pay the resulting debts. [It was the state that made lawful
the appropriation by landowners]{.underline} of the forests, streams,
and commons, and [imposed terrifying penalties on those who persisted in
claiming the old rights to these resources]{.underline}. It was the
state that freed serfs or emancipated sharecroppers only to leave them
landless. (52) [The \"Law\", then, was a tool of the powerful to protect
their interests, then, as now. It was a weapon against the poor and
impoverished, then, as now.]{.underline} It punished retail violence,
while turning a blind eye to the wholesale violence daily done by their
class masters. [The law was, and is, a tool of state power, utilized to
protect the status quo, no matter how oppressive that status was, or
is.]{.underline} Systems are essentially ways of doing things that have
concretized into tradition, and custom, without regard to the rightness
of those ways. [No system that causes this kind of harm to people should
be allowed to remain, based solely upon its time in existence. Systems
must serve life, or be discarded as a threat and a danger to life. Such
systems must pass away, so that their great and terrible violence passes
away with them.]{.underline}

### w2NC -- Ext -- Debate Bad - Harms Education

#### High school debate has become an activity primarily focused on speed and strategic arguments which directly trades off with critical thinking and argumentation skills

**McCordick 2017** (Jack McCordick, Yale University and national debate
champion. The Corrosion of High School Debate -- and How it Mirror
American Politics. September 26th, 2017. Date Accessed: July 7th,

While high school football players burst out of locker rooms at halftime
to vigorous cheers, their counterparts on the debate team exit their
buses and cars to a more muted welcome: the quiet babble of a school
cafeteria [**early on a Saturday** morning**,**]{.underline} where
[**teams of debaters rush to colonize their plots of tables and chairs**
nearest to the electrical outlets or concessions stand.]{.underline} As
extracurriculars go, debate may be the most grinding of them all. In my
four years of high school debating, I spent many long nights holed up
alone in my room poring over amicus briefs or economic analyses. I
passed even longer weekends on buses and planes traveling to schools
across the country and staying in hotels or with local families. From
winter to spring, in settings as grand as a Harvard lecture hall and as
cramped as a boiler room in a Salt Lake City public school, my debate
partner and I held forth on everything from nuclear proliferation to
sanctions against Russia to the private prison industry. The world of
high school debate is often portrayed as a refuge of the budding
brainiac, an incubator of the 21st century's next generation of leaders.
To some extent it is that. But the more revealing truth is that the
debating community for years has been afflicted with an ideological and
practical struggle over the nature of debate. And that struggle does not
exist in a vacuum of cafeterias and lecture halls. It has powerful
implications for the current state of U.S. politics and for the pursuit
of social justice. Looking back, [it seems as if the course of my high
school debating career mirrored a deeper erosion in the quality of
debate in our wider society]{.underline}. Thanks to a media landscape
poisoned by partisan loyalties, the dissemination of "fake news" and the
ideological echo chambers created by social media, the country is in the
throes of a deep crisis. We don't know who we are anymore. When I asked
myself whether my extracurricular was a force against this decline, or
an accessory to it, far too often I settled on the latter. [The
conventions of high school debate were enabling, at times even creating,
our divisive culture.]{.underline} To understand how high school debate
went awry, you would have to go all the way back to its origins. The
first debate format practiced widely in high schools, beginning in the
1970s, was called Policy Debate. The format, which is still around
today, consists of two teams of two debaters each. The affirmative team
proposes a policy "plan" based on a resolution---for example, "The
United States federal government should significantly reform its
criminal justice system." The negative team responds to that plan.
Unlike more recent formats, where the topics change month-to-month,
policy topics run for an entire year and require extraordinary
dedication to research and preparation. As Policy Debate grew in
popularity, the more Machiavellian debaters attempted to gain an edge by
overwhelming their opponents with as many arguments and as much
supporting evidence as possible. This was because if a team "dropped" an
argument by its opponent---if it did not respond to the other side's
claim---that argument was conceded as "true," no matter how insane it
was. Chief among the strategies exploiting this rule was "spreading" (a
combination of "speed" and "reading"), where debaters would rattle off
arguments at a blistering pace. Their speeches often exceeded 300 words
per minute. (A conversational pace is about 60 per minute.) [**Debaters
started formulating outlandish arguments**. The more apocalyptic the
outcome the better, **with little care for the argument's probability or
real-world application**]{.underline}**.** "A new retirement program
will trigger a nuclear war." "Prison overcrowding would cause the
destruction of the ozone layer." High school debate had come to this.
[If you were to peek into a room in the middle of a policy round, you
would likely be treated to a flurry of limbs and spittle, as **a
teenager expelled arguments from his mouth with such speed and force
that he would sometimes appear to lose control** of his fine motor
functions.]{.underline} When an executive of Phillips Petroleum, then
the primary sponsor of the National Forensics League, observed a debate
at the 1979 national championship, he found it utterly incomprehensible.
The executive aired his concerns to the league's executive council,
resulting in an entirely new debate category called the Lincoln-Douglas
debate. This format, with its express reference to the famous debates
over slavery between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, was designed
to promote debates about values and prioritize rhetorical persuasion. In
contrast to Policy Debate's wonkish topics, L.D. featured more timeless
resolutions. "It is morally permissible to kill one innocent person to
save the lives of more innocent people." Or "When in conflict, idealism
ought to be valued above pragmatism. [The new format earned the disdain
of Policy Debate's more snobbish competitors, who joked that its
initials stood for "learning disabled."]{.underline} But for students
disillusioned with P.D.'s descent into nonsensical, mile-a-minute
argumentation, it was a godsend. At least for a while. Soon L.D.
suffered the same fate as its precursor. [**The speed of argumentation
increased**, as did the amount of evidence required to be competitive at
the national level. As with Policy Debate, **the arguments became
increasingly unmoored from reality.** Some debaters even began refusing
to debate the resolutions altogether, formulating elaborate theoretical
and critical arguments that were, at best, tenuously linked to the topic
they had been given.]{.underline} As L.D. descended further and further
into absurdity, Ted Turner, the billionaire founder of CNN, came along
and attempted to turn the ship again. Like the Philips executive several
decades earlier, he pushed the National Forensic League in 2002 to
establish a new debate format that would be plainspoken and jargon-free.
The resulting format, which immediately drew comparisons to CNN's
"Crossfire," was called Public Forum. Its title was an expression of Mr.
Turner's hope that any reasonably informed member of the public could
walk into a Public Forum round and be able to pick a winner. A decade
and a half after its inception, P.F. is still by far the most
intelligible category in debate. However, in recent years its speed has
increased markedly, as have the mountains of evidence. The **[emphasis
on logic and critical thinking has waned. High school debate today is
basically an intellectual game, not an exercise in
truth-seeking.]{.underline}** [It has been turned into something that
can easily be scored. **This eliminates the complexity and intricacy of
real discourse about real issues.** If debate is a game, then the
execution of a "spread" is like a well-timed blitz in
football]{.underline}. Convincing a judge that your opponents' arguments
would cause human extinction is equivalent to a successful Hail Mary
pass. Dozens of summer debate camps have cropped up across the country,
offering students the opportunity to go "from novice to nationals," as
one brochure put it. Companies now offer bundles of prepackaged
evidence, or "briefs," to debaters willing to pay to get the upper hand.
[**Instead of producing** free, **rigorous thinkers committed to the
pursuit of truth, debate clubs now promote a very specific technical
mastery of skills that do not easily translate to the demands of real
life.** The problems plaguing high school debate are mirrored in our
public sphere. **Political discourse is often little more than a game.**
Its goal is to score political points with witty rejoinders and scathing
takedowns. **The purpose of "adult debate,"**]{.underline} as with
debate for 16-year-olds[**, is to bludgeon your opponent into submission
instead of engaging in** open-minded **dialogue.**]{.underline} Over
time I began to realize that high school debate was my firsthand
education in the perversion and abuse of language. I learned how
language could be used to conceal, to muddle. This was not limited to
the debate community. The writer (and former debate wunderkind) Ben
Lerner once wrote, "Americans are always getting 'spread' in their daily
lives."

not endore the ableist language in this cite/card

I still remember the first debate I ever did. It was in a high school
classroom that smelled of deodorant. Our school ran a debate club
on-and-off throughout my adolescence, and I loved the idea of taking
part ever since I first saw a session in eighth grade. As a dorky
11-year-old drowning in a sweater I was supposed to "grow into," I sat
in the back of the audience, enthralled. The debaters were all much
older than me and used a lot of big words, like the smarter adults I
knew and wanted to be. Five years later, I was 16, very confident in my
intelligence, and very insecure about everything else (still hadn't
grown into that sweater). A classmate decided to start up the debate
club again, and I pounced on the opportunity to join. Our first subject
was reinstating the death penalty, and I was "anti" (since we were young
and sincere, we all picked the sides we really believed in. One of the
people on the "pro" side is now a cop). For our opening speech, I gave
all the points you would expect in an argument against the death
penalty: the unacceptably high rate of false convictions, the particular
targeting of non-white defendants, the cost, the cruelty, the lack of
data proving its effectiveness as a deterrent. My opponent's speech was
much shorter. They simply named three famous child killers --- including
one who had murdered someone three miles from our school --- and said
"do you think these people deserve to live?" My opponent won. To
understand why debate is inadequate to the task of our current moment,
one need look no further than the Munk Debate: a biannual event held in
Toronto in which well-known academics, pundits, and policymakers argue
about controversial statement in a modern-day gladiatorial battle. Most
recently, the resolution was "the future of America is populist, not
liberal." Squaring up against each other were the notorious ex-White
House strategist and jacuzzi-ruiner Steve Bannon, and
guy-who-coined-Axis-of-Evil-but-is-somehow-now-in-the-Resistance David
Frum. There was an outcry over the decision to give Bannon yet another
platform, but for supporters of this type of event, scandal is a sign of
success. After all, these days we are constantly being told that one of
the top threats to society is not climate change or fascism but people
stifling debate. Some claim that by "no-platforming" controversial
speakers, or calling pundits mean names on Twitter after they say
something racist on Bill Maher's show, we are facilitating a dangerous
slide into illiberalism. If those pearl-clutchers are to be believed,
the key to becoming a society of informed and sophisticated
intellectuals is to hook ourselves up to an IV of pure debate, and let
the heated repartee course through our veins until it leads us to
fact-based solutions. As it turned out, the debate didn't go so well for
fans of liberalism. Frum himself tried to make sense of it in a
postmortem published in The Atlantic, scratching his head at the
wreckage he and Bannon had left behind. At first, the post-debate
polling suggested that Bannon had won the hearts and minds of the
audience, with 57 percent taking his side by the end, compared to 28
percent at the start of the event. Later the Munk Debate officials
issued a correction, stating that the audience voted exactly the same at
the start and the end, which by the debate's rules is considered a draw.
The situation remains somewhat unclear, but we know this much: best case
scenario, Frum got onto a stage with a person who appeals to humanity's
grossest instincts, believing he could defeat those instincts with
knowledge, reason, and Enlightenment values --- and he didn't move the
needle in the slightest. Admittedly, debates can produce some pretty
entertaining clips of people you don't like getting owned. Peewee
Republican Charlie Kirk's explosive anger at being asked his salary is
objectively funny. And, depending on the format, debates can sometimes
be well-paced, reasonably fair, and introduce you to new information. A
recent debate at Pomona College, between Dan Mitchell of the libertarian
Cato Institute and Nathan J. Robinson of the socialist magazine Current
Affairs, is an example of a calm, well-moderated discussion in which
both parties had the space to explain themselves. Perhaps this has
something to do with the fact that this event was intended for a small
audience and seemingly recorded and uploaded as an afterthought, rather
than expressly for the plentiful Youtube money that rains down on any
right-wing pundit who finds an audience of excitable young reactionaries
craving edgy video content. [But any form of debate is inherently
flawed. The aim of debate is not to provide a detailed, cogent,
well-sourced answer to the question at hand. The aim of debate is to be
the most convincing, not the smartest, and anyone who's good at debating
knows this.]{.underline} [This is how former Breitbart scribe Ben
Shapiro has a reputation as an intellectual warrior when his arguments
mostly consist of saying incorrect things very fast. This is why
conservative political commentator Steven Crowder has a series called
"Change My Mind" in which he ambushes random college kids with a big
binder full of pre-prepared talking points, and pulls the mic away from
them anytime they seem like they might actually change someone's
mind.]{.underline} This is how a call to murder pedophiles got my high
school audience onside better than my scribbled stats on deterrence
rates did. People --- yes, even you --- do not make decisions on an
entirely rational basis. An audience is more easily won over with a
one-liner that inspires applause or laughter than a five-minute
explanation of a complicated phenomenon. A false statistic repeated
confidently will be more convincing than a truth stated haltingly by
some guy you've never heard of, and who you've already decided you don't
like because he's arguing against the guy you came to see. Massively
complex ideologies with hundreds of years of scholarship behind them are
reduced to a couple of fast-talking egos in Dockers thinking about the
best way to make their opponent look like a dumbass. Debate is not
politics. It's theater. Real learning is hard. It's a slow, confusing
process where you sometimes have to read long books with dreadful
covers, and look at footnotes and shit. It requires us to recognize and
then overcome our biases as best we can. It can take years to learn what
we really think and why, and then if we get a lingering feeling we might
be wrong, it can take years to un-learn and start all over. [Debate, in
contrast, offers an easy way out. Some dudes spouting their favorite
buzzwords in each other's vicinity makes us feel smart and engaged, like
we're in that fresco of the Greek men they put on all the philosophy
textbooks. (Small aside --- have you ever noticed how in this image, all
the female figures look thoroughly sick of these guys?) However, the
format of debate, which is supposed to represent the height of
intellectual tradition, encourages us instead to applaud the candidate
who is best at using simple rhetoric, looking suave, and machine-gunning
irrelevant lines at their browbeaten interlocutor.]{.underline} These
are all things that real intellectual inquiry is supposed to look
beyond. Do not be tempted by the promise of easy satisfaction. Watching
a debate can make you actively worse at understanding the nuances of a
topic. If you want to really know about a subject, here's my advice:
read widely and extensively (and not just the books your favorite
YouTuber recommends). Talk to people, patiently and fairly, rejecting
your instinctual desire to win. And perhaps most importantly --- take
this from a veteran --- do not reward former debate team kids with your
attention. They are the worst type of nerds and they never share their
snacks.

### 2NC -- Ext: Debate Bad -- Harms Skills

#### Debate dialogue is meaningless

**Mccordick 17** - Jack Mccordick is a freshman at Yale University and a
former intern at America. He and his teammates from Regis High School in

While high school football players burst out of locker rooms at halftime
to vigorous cheers, their counterparts on the debate team exit their
buses and cars to a more muted welcome: the quiet babble of a school
cafeteria early on a Saturday morning, where teams of debaters rush to
colonize their plots of tables and chairs nearest to the electrical
outlets or concessions stand. [As extracurriculars go, debate may be the
most grinding of them all]{.underline}. In my four years of high school
debating, I spent many long nights holed up alone in my room poring over
amicus briefs or economic analyses. I passed even longer weekends on
buses and planes traveling to schools across the country and staying in
hotels or with local families. From winter to spring, in settings as
grand as a Harvard lecture hall and as cramped as a boiler room in a
Salt Lake City public school, my debate partner and I held forth on
everything from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Russia to the
private prison industry. As extracurriculars go, debate is maybe the
most grinding of them all. The world of high school debate is often
portrayed as a refuge of the budding brainiac, an incubator of the 21st
century's next generation of leaders. To some extent it is that. [But
the more revealing truth is that the debating community for years has
been afflicted with an ideological and practical struggle over the
nature of debate. And that struggle does not exist in a vacuum of
cafeterias and lecture halls. It has powerful implications for the
current state of U.S. politics and for the pursuit of social
justice.]{.underline} Looking back, it seems as if the course of my high
school debating career mirrored a deeper erosion in the quality of
debate in our wider society. Thanks to a media landscape poisoned by
partisan loyalties, the dissemination of "fake news" and the ideological
echo chambers created by social media, [the country is in the throes of
a deep crisis. We don't know who we are anymore]{.underline}. When I
asked myself whether my extracurricular was a force against this
decline, or an accessory to it, far too often I settled on the latter.
The conventions of high school debate were enabling, at times even
creating, our divisive culture. To understand how high school debate
went awry, you would have to go all the way back to its origins. The
first debate format practiced widely in high schools, beginning in the
1970s, was called Policy Debate. The format, which is still around
today, consists of two teams of two debaters each. The affirmative team
proposes a policy "plan" based on a resolution---for example, "The
United States federal government should significantly reform its
criminal justice system." The negative team responds to that plan.
Unlike more recent formats, where the topics change month-to-month,
policy topics run for an entire year and require extraordinary
dedication to research and preparation. The conventions of high school
debate were enabling, at times even creating, our divisive culture. [As
Policy Debate grew in popularity, the more Machiavellian debaters
attempted to gain an edge by overwhelming their opponents with as many
arguments and as much supporting evidence as possible. This was because
if a team "dropped" an argument by its opponent---if it did not respond
to the other side's claim---that argument was conceded as
"true,"]{.underline} no matter how inane it was. Chief among the
strategies exploiting this rule was "spreading" (a combination of
"speed" and "reading"), where debaters would rattle off arguments at a
blistering pace. Their speeches often exceeded 300 words per minute. (A
conversational pace is about 60 per minute.) [Debaters started
formulating outlandish arguments. The more apocalyptic the outcome the
better, with little care for the argument's probability or real-world
application. "A new retirement program will trigger a nuclear war."
"Prison overcrowding would cause the destruction of the ozone layer."
High school debate had come to this.]{.underline} If you were to peek
into a room in the middle of a policy round, you would likely be treated
to a flurry of limbs and spittle, as a teenager expelled arguments from
his mouth with such speed and force that he would sometimes appear to
lose control of his fine motor functions. When an executive of Phillips
Petroleum, then the primary sponsor of the National Forensics League,
observed a debate at the 1979 national championship, he found it utterly
incomprehensible. The executive aired his concerns to the league's
executive council, resulting in an entirely new debate category called
the Lincoln-Douglas debate. The more Machiavellian debaters attempted to
gain an edge by overwhelming their opponents with as many arguments as
possible. This format, with its express reference to the famous debates
over slavery between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, was designed
to promote debates about values and prioritize rhetorical persuasion. In
contrast to Policy Debate's wonkish topics, L.D. featured more timeless
resolutions. "It is morally permissible to kill one innocent person to
save the lives of more innocent people." Or "When in conflict, idealism
ought to be valued above pragmatism." The new format earned the disdain
of Policy Debate's more snobbish competitors, who joked that its
initials stood for "learning disabled." But for students disillusioned
with P.D.'s descent into nonsensical, mile-a-minute argumentation, it
was a godsend. At least for a while. Soon L.D. suffered the same fate as
its precursor. The speed of argumentation increased, as did the amount
of evidence required to be competitive at the national level. [As with
Policy Debate, the arguments became increasingly unmoored from reality.
Some debaters even began refusing to debate the resolutions altogether,
formulating elaborate theoretical and critical arguments that were, at
best, tenuously linked to the topic they had been given.]{.underline} As
L.D. descended further and further into absurdity, Ted Turner, the
billionaire founder of CNN, came along and attempted to turn the ship
again. Like the Philips executive several decades earlier, he pushed the
National Forensic League in 2002 to establish a new debate format that
would be plainspoken and jargon-free. The resulting format, which
immediately drew comparisons to CNN's "Crossfire," was called Public
Forum. Its title was an expression of Mr. Turner's hope that any
reasonably informed member of the public could walk into a Public Forum
round and be able to pick a winner. A decade and a half after its
inception, P.F. is still by far the most intelligible category in
debate. However, in recent years its speed has increased markedly, as
have the mountains of evidence. [The emphasis on logic and critical
thinking has waned.]{.underline} Ted Turner hoped that any reasonably
informed member of the public could walk into a Public Forum round and
be able to pick a winner. [High school debate today is basically an
intellectual game, not an exercise in truth-seeking. It has been turned
into something that can easily be scored. This eliminates the complexity
and intricacy of real discourse about real issues]{.underline}. If
debate is a game, then the execution of a "spread" is like a well-timed
blitz in football. Convincing a judge that your opponents' arguments
would cause human extinction is equivalent to a successful Hail Mary
pass. Dozens of summer debate camps have cropped up across the country,
offering students the opportunity to go "from novice to nationals," as
one brochure put it. Companies now offer bundles of prepackaged
evidence, or "briefs," to debaters willing to pay to get the upper hand.
Instead of producing free, rigorous thinkers committed to the pursuit of
truth, debate clubs now promote a very specific technical mastery of
skills that do not easily translate to the demands of real life. The
problems plaguing high school debate are mirrored in our public sphere.
[**Political discourse is often little more than a game. Its goal is to
score political points with witty rejoinders and scathing takedowns. The
purpose of "adult debate," as with debate for 16-year-olds, is to
bludgeon your opponent into submission instead of engaging in
open-minded dialogue.** Over time I began to realize that high school
debate was my firsthand education in the perversion and abuse of
language. I learned how language could be used to conceal, to muddle**.
This was not limited to the debate community**]{.underline}. The writer
(and former debate wunderkind) Ben Lerner once wrote, "Americans are
always getting 'spread' in their daily lives." High school debate was my
firsthand education in the perversion and abuse of language. [Think of
the rapid-fire medical warnings at the end of prescription drug
commercials. Consider the various types of fine print we are exposed to
every day from financial institutions and healthcare companies, not to
mention Apple's "Terms and Conditions." I remember that even when high
school debates slowed down enough to seem comprehensible, the avalanche
of evidence (much of it of dubious value) and specialized jargon often
confused more than it revealed. **It became like the kind of language
currently poisoning our public sphere.**]{.underline} I learned
immensely important skills from my four years of debate. I have met many
brilliant, incredibly well-read students from across the country from
schools dedicated to treating debate the right way. But these are
exceptions, not the rule. The norms that currently guide debate elevate
form over content, and victory over truth. Debate programs are perfectly
situated to produce students who want to seek the truth, who will resist
the decay of quality public speech. [As currently
practiced,]{.underline} however[, the clearest evidence of a high school
debate career is often just a collection of plastic trophies, slowly
gathering dust.]{.underline}

## 2NC -- Alternative Models

### 2NC -- Collaborative Model - Skills

#### Prefer The Collaborative model as opposed to the adversarial nature of plan-centric debate -- it functions as a training ground for technical skills necessary for comprehension and communication 

**Yanklowitz 13** (Dr. Shmuly Yanklowitz, President & Dean of the Valley
Beit Midrash, the Founder & President of Uri L'Tzedek, the Founder and
CEO of The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute and the author of ten books on
Jewish ethics, "Cognitive Conflict: Should Educational Debates Be
Competitive or Collaborative?" Huffpost.com, August 26, 2013,
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/should-educational-debates-be-competitive-or-collaborative_b_3802088)//AR

I recently made the case for the importance of developing argument
skills and explored various academic approaches to enhancing cognitive
development. [We must also explore whether we\'ll embrace a competitive
or collaborative learning environment to further student
growth.]{.underline} While there is support for using dyadic
argumentation as a means of cognitive engagement (Billig, 1987; Kuhn,
1991), [there is debate about whether argumentation should be
competitive, collaborative or a combination of the two]{.underline}.
Others have framed this debate as being about \"[adversarial\" versus
\"exploratory\" discourse]{.underline}. In favor of collaborative
learning, Lin and Anderson (2008) explain that \"[rubbing up against
others with different points of view is one of the best ways to bring to
light gaps in understanding, inconsistencies in thinking, and my-side
bias, and hence, the value of collaborative discussion and reasoned
argumentation]{.underline}.\" Students can collaborate by challenging
each other but there are other models of collaboration to consider.
Since argument consists both of \"product\" (propositions and
conclusions) and \"process\" (dialogue about arguments) [collaboration
can come in the form of discourse (process) or in a shared goal
(product]{.underline}). Walton (1999) termed it differently as
\"information-seeking\" dialogue rather than a persuasive dialogue.
Wegerif, Mercer, and Dawes (1999) have called collaborative learning
\"exploratory talk.\" Reznitskaya et al. (2001) suggests that
\"[collaborative discussion appears to be an effective training ground
for the development and internalization of generalized knowledge of
argumentation.\"]{.underline} Felton (2003) suggests that a \"process of
co-constructing arguments is accomplished through the use of discourse
strategies\" through \"argument construction\" and \"discourse
strategies.\" Others explain collaborative argumentation as \"[a social
process in which individuals work together to construct and critique
arguments]{.underline}\" (Golanicks & Nussbaum, 2008; Nussbaum, 2002). A
strong basis for adversarial argumentation can be traced back to Piaget.
Through cognitive conflict, Piaget suggested, conceptual change
triggered by disagreement could occur (1963). According to Piaget, a
learner constructs knowledge when receiving input from the environment.
The learner\'s mental structures incorporate the new experience
(assimilation). [If the newly-assimilated information conflicts with a
previously formed mental structure, then the result is called
disequilibrium which motivates the learner to seek
equilibrium]{.underline}. [Reaching equilibrium results in]{.underline}
what Piaget called accommodation leading to the [development of new
mental structures. Through]{.underline} this [assimilation and
accommodation, the learner adapts to the environmental input
received]{.underline}. For Piaget, there are four primary stages of
cognitive development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete
operational, formal operational. In Felton\'s competitive argumentation
model (debate), there are three skills to argument construction:
\"producing justifications, producing counterarguments, and rebutting
counterarguments.\" However Felton suggests that the skills of argument
construction are learned at a young age and that our educational focus
should be on discourse strategies; that is, \"to construct arguments
competitively in social contexts.\" Felton and Kuhn (2001) have even
developed a system of categorization for strategies in argumentative
discourse. Keefer, Zeitz, and Resnick (2000) claim that **[collaborative
argumentation enables deeper arguments than adversarial
argumentation]{.underline}**. However, it should be acknowledged that
some claim that there is not one correct method (collaborative or
competitive) for all students. Rather, each student\'s personality
should be taken into consideration. Nussbaum (2002), for example, showed
that \"[introverts tend to prefer collaborative over adversarial
discourse\" and may feel more threatened by adversarial
argumentation.]{.underline} While a comparison between the competitive
and collaborative models can be quite complex, a more prevailing
approach has been put forth. Kuhn, Shaw and Felton (1997) wrote: \"In
the case of argumentive reasoning, [the conflict model of change has
dominated, on the assumption that the power of dialogue stems from the
discrepancy between viewpoints,]{.underline} creating the opportunity
for each member of the dyad to be exposed to new perspectives that might
potentially be integrated into their own thinking.\" **[Students
collaborate through a dialogical adversarial approach to
argument.]{.underline}** Kuhn et al. (2008) [distinguish between the
\"classical argument\" goal (prevailing over an opponent) from \"dilemma
resolution\" (resolving the underlying problem that the two sides
address).]{.underline} To further epistemic and moral development, we
must focus more on cognitive development through the cultivation of
argument skills. We also must determine the learning culture that will
serve as a future foundation for how students view the other in the
marketplace of ideas. The choice between a competitive or collaborative
learning environment will not only determine the quality of learning but
it may also help determine the nature of our future economies and
political cultures.

### 2NC -- Collaborative Model -- Truth Testing

#### Purely competitive models of debate prioritize winning over the discovery of truth -- only a collaborative model ensures the veracity of truth-testing itself

**Tsipursky 17** (Gleb Tsipursky Ph.D., professor at the Ohio State
University, where he published dozens of articles in peer-reviewed
academic publications, "How To Win Arguments Through Collaborative
Truth-Seeking Research-based strategies to win arguments by finding the
truth.", Psychology Today, April 28, 2017,
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intentional-insights/201704/how-win-arguments-through-collaborative-truth-seeking)//AR

We frequently use debates to resolve different opinions about the truth.
However, debates are not always the best course for figuring out the
truth. In more emotionally charged situations, the technique of
collaborative truth-seeking is often better. The Problem with Debates
The usual method of hashing out disagreements in order to discover the
truth about reality is through debates, in person or online. Yet [more
often than not,]{.underline} **[people on opposing sides of a debate end
up seeking to persuade rather than prioritizing truth
discovery]{.underline}**. Indeed, [research suggests that debates have a
specific evolutionary function -- not for discovering the truth but to
ensure that our perspective prevails within a tribal social
context]{.underline}. No wonder debates are often compared to wars. This
is especially so in emotionally charged topics, such as politics, as our
autopilot system takes over and inhibits our ability to be rational in
our engagement with others. [We may hope that we would strive to
discover the truth during debates.]{.underline} Yet given that we are
not always fully rational and strategic in our social engagements, it is
easy to slip up within debate mode and orient toward winning instead of
uncovering the truth. Heck, I know that I sometimes forget in the midst
of a heated debate that I may be the one who is wrong -- I'd be
surprised if this didn't happen with you. So while we should certainly
continue to engage in debates, we should also use additional strategies
-- less natural and intuitive ones. These strategies could put us in a
better mindset for updating our beliefs and improving our perspective on
the truth. [One such solution is a mode of engagement called
**collaborative truth-seeking.**]{.underline} Collaborative
Truth-Seeking Collaborative truth-seeking is one way of describing [a
more intentional approach in which two or more people with different
opinions engage in a process that focuses on finding out the
truth]{.underline}. Collaborative truth-seeking is a modality that
should be used among people with shared goals and a shared sense of
trust. [Some important features of collaborative truth-seeking, which
are often not present in debates, are: focusing on a desire to change
one's own mind toward the truth;]{.underline} a curious attitude; being
sensitive to others' emotions; striving to avoid arousing emotions that
will hinder updating beliefs and truth discovery; and a trust that all
other participants are doing the same. These can contribute to increased
social sensitivity, which, together with other attributes, correlate
with accomplishing higher group performance on a variety of activities.
Share weaknesses and uncertainties in your own position Share your
biases about your position Share your social context and background as
relevant to the discussion. For instance, I grew up poor once my family
immigrated to the US when I was 10, and this naturally influences me to
care about poverty more than some other issues, thus biasing me in this
area Vocalize curiosity and the desire to learn Ask the other person to
call you out if they think you\'re getting emotional or engaging in
emotive debate instead of collaborative truth-seeking, and consider
using a safe word Here are additional techniques that can help you stay
in collaborative truth-seeking mode after establishing trust:
Self-signal: signal to yourself that you want to engage in collaborative
truth-seeking, instead of debating Empathize: try to empathize with the
other perspective that you do not hold by considering where their
viewpoint came from, why they think what they do, and recognizing that
they feel that their viewpoint is correct Keep calm: be prepared with
emotional management to calm your emotions and those of the people you
engage with when a desire for debate arises. Watch out for defensiveness
and aggressiveness in particular Go slow: take the time to listen fully
and think fully Consider pausing: have an escape route for complex
thoughts and emotions if you can't deal with them in the moment by
pausing and picking up the discussion later. Say "I will take some time
to think about this," and/or write things down Echo: paraphrase the
other person's position to indicate and check whether you've fully
understood their thoughts Be open: orient toward improving the other
person's points to argue against their strongest form Stay the course:
be passionate about wanting to update your beliefs, maintain the most
truthful perspective, and adopt the best evidence and arguments, no
matter if they are yours of those of others Be diplomatic: when you
think the other person is wrong, strive to avoid saying \"you\'re wrong
because of X\" but instead to use questions, such as \"what do you think
X implies about your argument?\" Be specific and concrete: go down
levels of abstraction Be clear: make sure the semantics are clear to all
by defining terms. Consider tabooing terms if some are emotionally
arousing, and make sure you are describing the same territory of reality
Be probabilistic: use probabilistic thinking and probabilistic language,
to help get at the extent of disagreement and be as specific and
concrete as possible. For instance, avoid saying that X is absolutely
true, but say that you think there\'s an 80% chance it\'s the true
position. Consider adding what evidence and reasoning led you to believe
so, for both you and the other participants to examine this chain of
thought When people whose perspective you respect fail to update their
beliefs in response to your clear chain of reasoning and evidence,
update a little somewhat toward their position, since that presents
evidence that your position is not very convincing [Confirm your
sources]{.underline}: look up information when it\'s possible to do so
(Google is your friend) Charity mode: try to be more charitable to
others and their expertise than seems intuitive to you, as our
intuitions are a bad guide to seeking the truth when the person with
whom we are in discussion has a perspective different from our own. For
instance, if someone says something that seems wrong to you, check to
make sure that is what the person actually said - you might have
misheard things, or the person might have misstated something [Use the
reversal test to check for status quo bias]{.underline}: If you are
discussing whether to change some specific numeric parameter - say
increase by 50% the money donated to charity X - state the reverse of
your positions, for example decreasing the amount of money donated to
charity X by 50%, and see how that impacts your perspective Use CFAR's
double crux technique In this technique, two parties who hold different
positions on an argument each writes the the fundamental reason for
their position (the crux of their position). This reason has to be the
key one, so if it was proven incorrect, then each would change their
perspective. Then, look for experiments that can test the crux. Repeat
as needed. If a person identifies more than one reason as crucial, you
can go through each as needed. More details are here. Of course, not all
of these techniques are necessary for high-quality collaborative
truth-seeking. Some are easier than others, and different techniques
apply better to different kinds of truth-seeking discussions. You can
apply some of these techniques during debates as well, such as double
crux and the reversal test. Try some out and see how they work for you.
Conclusion [Engaging in collaborative truth-seeking goes against our
natural impulses to win in a debate, and is thus more cognitively
costly.]{.underline} It also tends to take more time and effort than
just debating. It is also easy to slip into debate mode even when using
collaborative truth-seeking, because of the intuitive nature of debate
mode. Moreover, collaborative truth-seeking need not replace debates at
all times. This non-intuitive mode of engagement can be chosen when
discussing issues that relate to deeply-held beliefs and/or ones that
risk emotional triggering for the people involved. Because of my own
background, I would prefer to discuss poverty in collaborative
truth-seeking mode rather than debate mode, for example. On such issues,
[collaborative truth-seeking can provide a shortcut to resolution, in
comparison to protracted, tiring, and emotionally challenging
debates]{.underline}. Likewise, using collaborative truth-seeking to
resolve differing opinions on all issues holds the danger of creating a
community oriented excessively toward sensitivity to the perspectives of
others, which might result in important issues not being discussed
candidly. After all, research shows the importance of having
disagreement in order to make wise decisions and to figure out the
truth. Of course, [collaborative truth-seeking is well suited to
expressing disagreements in a sensitive way]{.underline}, so if used
appropriately, it might permit even people with triggers around certain
topics to express their opinions. Taking these caveats into
consideration, [collaborative truth-seeking is a great tool to use to
discover the truth]{.underline} and to update our beliefs, as it can get
past the high emotional barriers to altering our perspectives that have
been put up by evolution.

https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy)MNF

What role should arms sales play in American foreign policy? Though
major deals --- like Trump's \$110 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia
announced in 2017 or the decision to sell arms to Ukraine --- [provoke
brief periods of discussion, there is no real debate in Washington about
the wisdom of exporting vast quantities of weapons around the globe to
allies and nonallies alike]{.underline}. [Congress, which has the
authority to cancel arms deals, has not impeded a deal since the passage
of the 1976 Arms Export Control Act created the framework for doing
so]{.underline}. Since 9/11 the pace of sales has increased. From 2002
to 2016, the United States sold roughly \$197 billion worth of weapons
and related military support to 167 countries.1In just his first year
Donald Trump cut a deal worth as much as \$110 billion to Saudi Arabia
alone and notified Congress of 157 sales worth more than \$84 billion to
42 other nations.2Despite losing market share over the past two decades
because of increasing competition, [the United States still enjoyed the
largest share of the global arms trade between 2012 and 2016 at 33
percent.3 The current consensus in favor of arms sales rests on three
planks]{.underline}. First, advocates argue that arms sales enhance
American security by bolstering the military capabilities of allies,
enabling them to deter and contain their adversaries, and helping
promote stability in critical areas like the Middle East and Southeast
Asia. Second, they argue that arms sales help the United States exert
influence over the behavior and foreign policies of client nations.
Finally, advocates argue that arms sales provide a boon to the U.S.
economy and fiscal benefits in the form of lower unit costs to the
Pentagon, while helping ensure the health of the American defense
industrial base.4 We argue, however, that **[Washington's faith in the
wisdom of foreign arms sales is seriously misplaced]{.underline}. [The
benefits tend to be oversold]{.underline}**[,]{.underline} and the
downsides are often simply ignored. [The defense industry and its
champions, in particular, have long exaggerated the economic boon of
arms sales]{.underline}.5 And even if they were greater, economic
benefits alone are not worth subverting strategic considerations. [More
importantly, the strategic deficits of arms sales are severe enough to
overwhelm even the most optimistic economic argument. It is the
strategic case for and against arms sales that we consider in this
analysis]{.underline}. [Arms sales create a host of negative,
**unintended consequences** that warrant a much more cautious and
limited approach, even **in support of an expansive grand strategy like
primacy or liberal hegemon**y.]{.underline} [From the perspective of
those who would prefer a more restrained American foreign policy, the
prospective benefits of engaging in the arms trade are even
smaller]{.underline}. Even in cases where the United States wants a
nation to arm itself, there is rarely a need for the weapons to come
from the United States. Moreover, the United States would generate
significant diplomatic flexibility and moral authority by refraining
from selling arms. Given these outsized risks and nebulous rewards, the
United States should greatly reduce international arms sales.

[We know that these deaths are a predictable outcome of our country's
**lack of political will** to make a change and an underinvestment in
prevention approaches that work.]{.underline} [Through a public health
approach]{.underline} [that focuses on drawing from evidence and
addressing the factors that increase or decrease the risk of gun
violence, **particularly in communities** that are disproportionately
impacted, we can save lives.]{.underline} Each time a major tragedy
occurs, the discourse tends to focus on addressing a specific venue. In
the wake of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas School in
Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018, there is an understandable focus
on school safety. We strongly **[support broad engagement of
community]{.underline}** [members, including young people and other
survivors of gun violence, policymakers, and others, in insisting that
schools be safe. We must also insist on that same level of safety for
our places of worship, shopping malls, movie theaters, concert venues,
nightclubs, workplaces, neighborhoods, and homes]{.underline}. We are
listening to young people from all races, classes, and sexualities, in
Florida, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and throughout the country, who are
unifying to speak truth to power. [We have renewed hope that, together,
we can prevent gun violence---]{.underline} [not just in the case of
mass shootings but also in the case of domestic violence, suicide,
community violence, and violence involving law enforcement]{.underline}.
We first developed this list after the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012. [The
public health approach has evolved since then, and we have now updated
it, including more attention to addressing multiple forms of gun
violence.]{.underline} The recommendations below begin with attention to
reducing immediate risks related to guns, broaden to address the
underlying contributors to gun violence, and then [address the
prevention infrastructure necessary to ensure
effectiveness]{.underline}. We also include recommendations related to
new frontiers for research and practice, to ensure that we continue to
learn, innovate, and increase our impact over time. [The set of
recommendations illustrate that one program or **policy alone is not
going to significantly reduce gun violence**, but rather, through
**comprehensive strategies**, we can achieve safety in our homes,
schools, and communities.]{.underline}

Violence](http://www.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@health/documents/webcontent/wcms1p-114466.pdf),
which prioritized prevention and upstream strategies, the City
experienced a 62% reduction in youth gunshot victims, a 34% reduction in
youth victims of crime, and a 76% reduction in youth arrests with a gun

is needed. [We must commit to helping **communities identify and
implement solutions**.]{.underline} Trauma, connection, and services:
Expand access to high quality, culturally competent, coordinated,
social, emotional, and mental health supports and address the impact of
trauma. [Too often gun violence is blamed on mental
illness]{.underline}, when in fact in most cases people who carry out
shootings do not have a diagnosable mental illness. [However, throughout
a community, members often recognize individuals who are disconnected
and/or otherwise in need of additional supports and
services.]{.underline} It is critical to reduce the stigma associated
with mental health needs and support our children, friends, family
members, and neighbors in seeking and obtaining appropriate supports.
For this to work, communities need resources to assess and connect
individuals at a high risk for harming themselves or others to
well-coordinated social, emotional, and mental health supports and
services, particularly in critical times of crisis and high need.
Further, trauma can have damaging effects on learning, behavior, and
health across the life course, especially during key developmental
stages such as early childhood and adolescence, and can increase the
risk for [multiple forms of
violence](https://www.preventioninstitute.org/publications/connecting-dots-overview-links-among-multiple-forms-violence).
[We need to do more to recognize trauma, develop trauma-informed
protocols, including for law enforcement, and support healing and
treatment for individuals who have experienced or are experiencing
trauma, including from exposure to violence in any form.]{.underline}

## 2NC -- Black Framework

### 2NC -- Political Efficacy -- Eurocentric Ethics

#### The affirmative replicates the Eurocentric notion of conceptual ethics, or ethics as a [way of thought]{.underline}. Only rupturing this academization of black resistance through [existential ethics]{.underline} can provide an alternative to Eurocentric political thought.

**Ani '94** -- Anthropologist and African Studies Scholar (Marimba,
"Yurugu: an African-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and
Behavior," March 1994, pages 329-221)

It has been part of the posture of [the moral philosophers of European
culture]{.underline} to disavow cultural commitment, yet their work has
contributed significantly to the survival and intensification of the
rhetorical ethic-the hypocrisy and the deception that constitute a vital
and definitive part of the content of European cultural imperial-
ism-and, therefore, to nationalistic objectives. To begin with the
Platonic-influenced utamawazo [provide]{.underline}s [the theoretical
basis for]{.underline} a conceptual ethics; [an ethical
system]{.underline}, the themes of which are considered to be valid, as
long as they are consistent in terms of the logic of that system. [What
is \"ethical\" becomes what is \"rational\" and \"logical.\" The most
\"ethical\" statement is the purest abstraction.]{.underline} As
Havelock correctly observes, the individual \"thinking\" psyche becomes
the seat of morality and the individual\'s ability to act ethically is
based on his ability to think \"rationally\"; i.e., \"abstractly."
[**The result, again, is \"talk.\" The European idea is that words
divorced from action,** feeling, commitment, from human involvement
**can them- selves be relevant to** (and properly inform) **human
interaction**]{.underline}-as long as they are part of a consistent
syntax; an approved semantical system. [This pursuit itself is an
exercise in self-deception.]{.underline} Primary cultures are
characterized by an \"existential ethic\" (Stanley Diamond) that is
based on and refers to actual behavior. [European culture gives rise to
semantical systems and instead of being concerned with the inconsistency
between \"word\" and \"deed**\"**]{.underline} (which could conceivably
be the determinant of ethical behaVior), [the moral philosophers are
merely concerned with verbal and what they call \"logical\"
inconsistency. One result of this characteristic of the culture is a
tendency to make philosophers the most irrelevant of people and to
effectively divorce their work from any decision-making
capacity]{.underline} or role that in any way influences the ethical
behavior of European peoples. What this tradition has done instead is to
support the culture in its ability to use words without meaning, and to
support Europeans in their quest to deceive others and themselves as
well. The body of literature known as \"ethical theory\" has to a large
degree been conducive to the growth of moral hypocrisy in European
culture. It is the \"liberal\" academic tradition in contemporary
European/ European American culture that uses the rhetorical ethic best
to sup- port the objectives of European chauvinism. [Ingeniously t**hese
theorists use the semantical systems of the moral philosophers**, the
\"brotherhood\" rhetoric]{.underline} of the Christian statement and
**[empty abstractions like \"humanitarianism\" and \"universalistic
ethics\" as evidence of the ideological commitments]{.underline}** of
the Europeans and therefore as indices of the nature of European
culture. [They are \"critical,\" because they say that the imperialistic
behavior of the European has represented a conflicting theme or
\"negative\" tendency in European development. The result of their
theories, however, is that they succeed in making the European
responsible for everything-the \"good\" as well as the \"bad\"-and in
the end the good far outweighs the bad and will,]{.underline} of course,
triumph along with \"reason.\" Norman F. Cantor provides an excellent
example of the subtle chauvinism of the European liberal academician in
his work on Western culture. He says, The new ethos of the late 1960\'s
sought to restore to their central place in Western culture the
religious, mystical, compassionate, imaginative, and altruistic ideals
that had been tarnished or ignored by industrialism and secularism, by
the mechanism and bureaucracy of modern life. 22 The new ethos had
indigenous roots in some of the central cur- rents of the Western
tradition-in Christian mysticism, in the Enlightenment\'s vision of a
happy and peaceful world, [in Romanticism\'s yearning of the union of
self and nature and for the union of all individuals in the Absolute
Spirit, in anarchism\'s faith in the spontaneous association of men in a
harmonious community when freed from the brutality and oppression of the
state]{.underline}, in Nietzsche\'s life-affirming ethic and Freud\'s
revelation of the pri- macy of erotic impulses, and in the existential
philosophy of Camus, Sartre, and Jaspers. 23 The trick is to \"claim\"
ideas that have failed to influence the def- inition of the culture:
because they do not fit in with the asili. In this way, \\any critique
of European ideology informed by a vision of the human that could only
have been created either by a rejection of European value or in a
culture qualitatively different from European culture itself becomes a
\"Western\" product. [And this argument (if \"argued\" at all) is made
on the basis of values that were, for the European, never more than
rhetoric!]{.underline} \"Christian mysticism\" becomes \"Western,\" and
the \"Enlightenment\'s vision of a happy world\" is not tarnished by the
fact that this world was to be defined in terms of and controlled by
European \"progress.\" Cantor\'s characterization of \"Western
liberalism\" is a perfect statement of what I have called the
\"rhetorical ethic.\" In the statement that follows, taken from the
concluding paragraphs of his three-vol- ume work on European cultural
history, Cantor claims, for the cul- ture, its most severe critics.
Movements that would seek the destruction of what the West has meant are
characterized as expres- sions of Western humanism and of Western
ideals. This excerpt is evi- dence of the characteristic of European
cultural nationalism that we are here delineating. This particular
example is all the more signifi- cant because it represents a fairly
recently published text, used to explain and interpret to the
European-American college student, the nature and meaning of
Western-European history: It is a pernicious misreading of history to
identify Western civilization with the racism, imperialism, and
capitalism of the late nineteenth century. Even in their heyday, [these
attitudes and institutions were only one side of the Western world view
and way of life.]{.underline} The destiny of Western civilization
immeasurably transcends the mistakes of one era. The West has had its
confusion, horror, and misery, its moments when anti-human doctrine have
seemed on the verge of carrying all before them. But it is the glory of
Western civilization that it has never stood still and has never
neglected for long the quest for institutions that can contribute to the
realization of human freedom. Soon its best minds have recalled the
highest ideals of the classical and Christian traditions; they have
inspired their contemporaries with the vision of a great age of
beginning anew, of the establishment of God\'s kingdom on earth or a
secular equivalent in their own time.\" Cantor concludes his panegyric
with the assurance that the \"great upheavals of the 1960\'s were
collectively only manifestations of the age-old western tradition by
which Western \'civilization\' periodically \'renews itself.\'\" In this
way he debunks the need for revolu- tion; and in fact \"claims\" the
revolutionaries, who, he says, will inevitably and happily be
overshadowed by the \"rationalists and moderates, II who have
restructured the institutions of the past and redirected the ideas of
the present. [The result has never been perfect justice or absolute
truth but sufficient justice and enough truth to satisfy the anxieties
of the contemporary era while reestablishing the social peace and
political order that the progress of civilization
requires.]{.underline}22 And so ends Cantor\'s historical study of the
\"genesis and des- tiny\" of Western culture. With its greatest minds as
the custodians of \"civilization\"-not just \"European civilization.\"
[My interpretation of that history is quite different, as it is informed
by an African-centered perspective and methodology.]{.underline} Cantor
is concerned lest the students of the \"new ethos\" would \"shatter\"
and irrevocably separate from what has historically been Western
European culture. **[Our conclusion is that the European tradition must
be \"shattered\" if a truly \"new ethos\" is to replace the
old.]{.underline}** This means a new utamaroho to fulfill a different
asiii. [But then centered in African interest I understand European
culture to be identified with anti-Africanism, the imperialistic
pursuit, and with a denial of the human spirit]{.underline}; whereas
Cantor finds this identification \"pernicious\" and makes the claim that
the \"liberation of the human spirit\" has been a \"central current\" in
the Western tradition. Ultimately Cantor\'s objectives are chauvinistic.
He is concerned with influencing students in such a way that they will
act to maintain the \"peace\" and \"order\" necessary for the
continuance of the European conception of \"progress,\" i.e., the
persistence of European power.

### 2NC -- Political Efficacy -- Cede the Political

#### Withdrawing from politics cedes power to the right

**Themba-Nixon 5** (Makani Themba-Nixon, executive director of The
Praxis Project, a media and policy advocacy organization, "Disrupting
the Discourse: Framing at the Intersection of Racism and Opportunity" AK
Press 2005, http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/praxis2.pdf)
//AR

[While talking about race has been declared passé in some communications
circles, any examination of conservative framing on crime, public school
funding, welfare and more show that they seem to talk about little
else.]{.underline} Affirmative action, public school funding, income
supports -- virtually every major political battle underway today banter
race somewhere close to the surface. Race and more precisely [racism, is
where the contest for the "dominant frame" is most intense]{.underline}
and where, when we don't pay close attention, we often lose the battle.
**[If progressives remain silent about race, they not only concede the
race frame to the right]{.underline}**. [They concede all of the issues
that conservatives successfully racialize]{.underline}. And the list of
these issues grows long. The fight over affirmative action invoked
centuries old notions of who is capable and deserving and who is not.
When President Reagan introduced America to the welfare queen, we
certainly got the picture in living color. And what's the main rationale
the right uses for public budget cuts? So those people won't waste your
hard earned money. The right frames nearly everything in a neat "us" and
"them" and, more often than not, the dividing line is the color line.
And they have centuries of stereotypes on their side. Their frames are
like an old song that's hard not to hum once the music starts. [Winning
hearts and minds on a wide range of social justice issues requires that
we disrupt these centuries of programming with a few old songs of our
own]{.underline}. A[nd it will take more than trying to code our
language behind vague "**values**" like **equality**, **opportunity** or
**fairness**.]{.underline} It is easy to get people, even people with
whom we often disagree, to agree that equality and opportunity is good.
[Disrupting the dominant frames on race, deservingness and competency
means focusing on two main questions: Why are things the way they are?
And how can they be different?]{.underline} The answers to these
questions distinguish our "opportunity talk" from the opposition. Every
"why" leads us to a different "how". T[heir "why" stories are bursting
with cultural and biological pathology as an explanation for everything
from poverty, school failure to crime. When the opposition starts that
old song of pathology, **it will only lead toward policies that punish
individuals**.]{.underline} O[ur job as progressives is to expose
patterns and systems of injustice in ways that help people understand
the structural roots of these issues and shift blame away from
victims.]{.underline} When we disrupt their frame and assert a different
story, things change.

### 2NC -- SSD -- DCM

#### SSD is key to rigorous decision-making skills

**Harrigan 8** (Casey Harrigan, Director of Debate at MSU, "A DEFENSE OF
SWITCH SIDE DEBATE", Thesis Submitted to the Graduate Faculty of WAKE

[Conviction generated through debating both sides is almost universally
preferable to dogmatic and non-negotiable assertions of
belief]{.underline} (Baird 1955, p. 6). [Switching sides grounds belief
in reasonable reflective thinking;]{.underline} it **[teaches that
decisions should not be rendered until all positions]{.underline}** and
possible consequences **[have been considered]{.underline}** in a
reasoned manner. [This method is closely linked to the value that debate
places on critical thinking]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, **[many
authors have noted the importance of SSD for generating]{.underline}**
such **[rigorous decision-making skills]{.underline}** (Muir 1993;
Parcher 1998; Rutledge 2002; Speice & Lyle 2003; English, Llano,
Mitchell, Morrison, Rief and Woods 2007). **[The critical thinking
taught by SSD provides the ultimate check against dangerous forms of
cooption.]{.underline}** Over time, certain arguments will prevail over
others only if they have a strong enough logical foundation to withstand
thorough scrutiny. [Debaters will change their minds to support the
"moderate" side of certain positions only if]{.underline}---after
reasoned reflection and sound conviction---[doing so is found to be
preferable]{.underline}. While such a "marketplace of 38 ideas" may be
marked by some imperfections, one of its most effective incarnations is
undoubtedly in academic debate rounds. There, appeals to wealth, status,
and power are minimized by a focus on logic and formal rules, which
protect the ability of all participants to contribute in an honest and
open manner. As a result, it should be assumed that [the insights
generated through debate's dialectic process will be generally correct
and that any shifting beliefs are the reflection of a social
good]{.underline} (the replacement of false ideas with truth).
[Conceiving of conviction in this manner redefines the role of debate
into what Baird calls an "educational procedure":]{.underline} the
formation of [a pedagogical playground to experiment with alternative
ideas]{.underline} and coalesce assertions and unwarranted beliefs into
sound conviction (1966, p. 6). **[Treating debate as a training ground
for advocacy and decision-making has several benefits]{.underline}**:
[it allows debaters the conceptual flexibility to experiment with
minority and extreme ideas, protects them from outside influences, and
buys them time before they are forced to publicly put forward their
opinions]{.underline} (Coverstone 1995). As a result, the primary focus
of the activity shifts from arguing to deciding, giving critical
thinking its crucial importance. A fundamental premise of the anti-SSD's
claim about cooption is thoroughly indicted: it is impossible to lose
one's convictions before they have truly been discovered.

### 2NC -- SSD - Debate key

#### SSD [in Debate]{.underline} is uniquely good to develop tolerance and comprehensive critical thinking

**Harrigan 8** (Casey Harrigan, Director of Debate at MSU, "A DEFENSE OF
SWITCH SIDE DEBATE", Thesis Submitted to the Graduate Faculty of WAKE
FOREST UNIVERSITY in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the
Degree of MASTER OF ARTS in the Department of Communication, May 2008,

It has been argued that many of the benefits of switching sides could
theoretically be achieved through alternative means (Murphy 1957; 1963).
After all, debaters should live well-rounded lives and have many
academic pursuits outside of the competitive arena. The benefits of
tolerance and critical thinking generated through intensive research and
understanding of the opposition's arguments might be created by simply
spending time reading and understanding multiple sides of complex
positions. Practice rounds that simulate actual debating but are
conducted in the privacy and seclusion of the debate office away from
public tournaments can expand debaters' experiences without requiring
SSD. All of this, the anti-SSD advocates such as Murphy say, can capture
the benefit of debating both sides without risking its ethical or social
downsides. However, [even if many of the strengths of switch side debate
can be achieved in other ways, it does not mean that they necessarily
would be.]{.underline} Some students will seek out avenues to broaden
their range of thinking and encounter beliefs that are contrary to their
own. Others will not. [For many students, the competitive aspects of
contest debating are the primary motivation for their initial engagement
with the tedious and complex literature featured in policy debates.
Without the push of SSD and the competitive drive]{.underline}
associated with wins and loses [of]{.underline} competitive [contest
debating, **most would not step outside their narrow personal
beliefs**]{.underline} and enter into a meaningful dialogue with
opposing arguments. [The task of educators is to make the tough choices
about how to direct the learning of their students in order to maximize
their educational benefit. SSD is a timetested way to do
that]{.underline}. 69 Moreover, as was noted by Greene and Hicks, [there
may be something different and special about actively assuming the
position of the advocate for the other side in a public way that is
qualitatively distinct from merely researching the "offending"
arguments]{.underline}. They write that, "**[a unique value of debating
both sides is that it works as a technique of embodied speech
performance]{.underline}**. To produce a liberal citizen requires more
than the presentation of different points of view.

### 2NC -- SSD - AT: Devil's Advocate

#### SSD is essential for effective critique of intolerable positions

**Harrigan 8** (Casey Harrigan, Director of Debate at MSU, "A DEFENSE OF
SWITCH SIDE DEBATE", Thesis Submitted to the Graduate Faculty of WAKE
FOREST UNIVERSITY in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the
Degree of MASTER OF ARTS in the Department of Communication, May 2008,

Tolerating the Intolerable: A Defense of Limited Argumentative Pluralism
[A second criticism of SSD]{.underline} that has recently been voiced
[is that, because the practice]{.underline} places some restrictions
upon what debaters may argue (by [forcing them to take the position of
the both the affirmative and the negative), it requires students to
become advocates for certain intolerable ideas that should be "off
limits]{.underline}" for discussion. For example, [the increasingly
prevalent usage of postmodern arguments in collegiate debate rounds has
caused many teams to argue that they should not be forced to defend the
"dirty" bureaucratic politics of the federal government]{.underline}
(Solt 2004). A similar phenomenon can be seen in wider spheres of
deliberation as well. During rallies by the Ku Klux Klan, many liberal
activists who generally defend freedom of speech have questioned their
right to spread their racist message. On the opposite side of the
spectrum, some conservatives have objected to United States negotiations
with the government of North Korea because of its poor human rights
record, instead choosing to "shun" the nation through diplomatic
restrictions and economic pressure. [Each of the previous examples
demonstrates that]{.underline}, in certain extremes, [the principles of
free speech and pluralism encounter contradictions. To allow each
individual to voice his or her own opinion, in the most absolute sense,
means to accommodate even those who seek to silence others from
speaking.]{.underline} [To reject views that many consider intolerable
or repulsive may reproduce intolerance]{.underline}. [Because
argumentative pluralism, as an expression of opinion and a litmus test
of societal values, is crucially important for advancing
tolerance,]{.underline} resolving these dilemmas in a manner that most
effectively facilitates respect for difference is an essential task for
engaged citizens of liberal democratic societies. With this goal in
mind, philosopher John Stuart Mill and other scholars of rhetoric and
argumentation have taken up the cause of providing a meta-theory to
guide public deliberation. While Mill is correct in his argument that no
opinion, no matter how minor, should be suppressed on the basis of its
falsity (a position supported by recent writing on argumentation), his
position should be modified to account for two "special cases" in which
suppression of certain views is desirable. First, on the occasion where
one interlocutor is actively attempting to silence another, advocates of
openness must, paradoxically, be willing to say "no" and seek closure.
Second, for the purpose of argument, a common starting point, or stasis,
is required for debate to begin and must be delineated with clear lines
of relevance.

### 2NC -- SSD -- AT: USFG exceptionalism

#### Defending the resolution does not demand defense of the United States Federal Government -- SSD incentivizes contesting [all]{.underline} current dogma, including American exceptionalism

**Harrigan 8** (Casey Harrigan, Director of Debate at MSU, "A DEFENSE OF

The arguments advanced by Massey and other vocal critics of switch side
debating are susceptible to several other persuasive responses. First,
as have been previously argued by Stannard (2006), [many of the
processes that have contributed to American
exceptionalism]{.underline}---globalization, infiltration of academic
institutions by agents of imperialism, etc.---[are on-going, inevitable,
and independent of the institution of competitive debate]{.underline}.
As Alan Coverstone has noted, th[e disengagement of the public from
political participation and adoption of a pure "spectator mentality" has
now become the "predominant mode" of politics]{.underline} (2005, p. 5).
Any citizen who been attentive to political developments over the past
eight years can tell that American politics has been overtaken by an
administration bent on pursuing illiberal policies while wrapping
themselves in the clothing of liberalism. Given the now almost
all-consuming exceptionalist mantra, **[debate is one of the last arenas
that reward anti-institutional thinking and oppositional
rhetoric]{.underline}** (Stannard 2006). **[It is a tremendous "stretch"
to attribute the causal source of exceptionalism to
debate]{.underline}** (Lacy 2006). Debate isn't Vietnam. Nothing in the
activity makes students participate. Once involved, there are no
thought-police who control the content of students' speeches. Those who
argue otherwise show a profound lack of respect for the magnitude of
violence that their comparisons draw likeness to. Instead, the exact
opposite seems truer: [a major and endemic problem, that contributes to
American exceptionalism, is the lack of debate at all levels of
society]{.underline}. Stannard agrees, warning: Don't throw the baby out
with the bathwater. Instead, [seek to expand this method of deliberation
to those who will use it to liberate themselves, confront power, and
create ethical, nonviolent patterns of problem resolution]{.underline}.
If capitalism corrupts debate, well, then I say we save debate. (2006)
[The proper task of critics is not to retreat into speaking only from
conviction. It is to strive to expand SSD to new avenue and to make
ideas that were once considered dogma contestable]{.underline}. The very
nature of the approach acts as a counter-weight to imperialism and
"foster\[s\] resistance to domination" (Stannard 2006). Second, [switch
side debate's emphasis on tolerance and empathy, which have been noted
by many authors]{.underline} (Sanders 1982; Muir 1993; Bellon 2000; Lacy
2002), [may indeed by one of the strongest "antidotes" to the disease of
exceptionalism]{.underline} (Mitchell & Suzuki 2004, p. 7). [Debate
combines a commitment to reason and logic over emotive and political
appeals, a priority placed upon quality research, and vigorous norms of
openness and plurality to create a forum where unwarranted]{.underline}
and inappropriate forms of [exceptionalism cannot survive]{.underline}.
English et al. have referred to [this deliberative attitude as **a
"bulwark against fundamentalism of all stripes**]{.underline}" (2007, p.
224). [SSD teaches that no argument is "off limits," that issues are
more complex than black and white]{.underline}, and that reflection and
contemplation are preferable to rash and preemptive decision-making. It
is thus no surprise, as the Debate Authors Working Group has noted, that
[many of the most vocal contemporary critics of the Bush
administration's exceptionalist]{.underline} (and debatably imperialist)
**[policies, including lawyer Neal Katyal and law professor Laurence
Tribe]{.underline}**, [received a portion of their training in the
pedagogical bull-pen of debate]{.underline}. In particular, **[SSD is an
especially effective tool to combat the "with us or against us"
absolutism of contemporary neoconservative ideology]{.underline}**.
Debating both sides increases debater's appreciation of the arguments
made by the opposition (English, Llano, Mitchell, Morrison, Rief and
Woods, 2007, p. 222). Oftentimes, as is frequently the case with complex
issues, a reasonable party may conclude that two positions, which are
polar opposites may each contain an element of truth. It is revealed
that a compromised position is preferable to either extreme and that the
discrete "with us" and "against us" stances are arbitrary and inaccurate
categorizations. Finally, [switch side debate prioritizes
deliberative]{.underline}, rather than majoritarian,
[democracy]{.underline} (Lacy 2006). As far back as Day (1966), **[there
is an emphasis on the expression of minority view points.]{.underline}**
[Debating both sides allows debaters the intellectual
flexibility]{.underline} (through un-attachment to their personal
beliefs) [to express dissent and critique even the most firmly
established policies and norms]{.underline}. This ensures a vibrant
activist influence in debate [that can provide at least a modest check
against the most extreme governmental abuses.]{.underline}

Genre Violation Four: Policymaker as Impersonal and the Rhetoric of
Personal Experience. [Debate]{.underline} is a competitive game. 112 It
[requires that its participants take on the positions of state actors
(at least when they are affirming the resolution). Debate resolutions
normally call for federal action]{.underline} in some area of domestic
or foreign policy. [Affirmative teams must support the resolution, while
the negative negates it. The debate then becomes a "laboratory" within
which debaters may test policies]{.underline}. 113 Argumentation scholar
Gordon Mitchell notes that "Although they \[end page 117\] may research
and track public argument as it unfolds outside the confines of the
laboratory for research purposes, [in this approach students witness
argumentation beyond the walls of the academy **as spectators**, with
**little or no apparent recourse** to **directly participate** or
**alter the course of events**]{.underline}." 114 [Although debaters
spend a great deal of time discussing and researching government action
and articulating arguments relevant to such action, what happens in
debate rounds has **limited or no real impact** on contemporary
governmental policy making. And participation does **not** result in the
majority of the debate community engaging in activism around the issues
they research]{.underline}. Mitchell observes that [the stance of the
policymaker in debate comes with a "sense of **detachment** associated
with **the spectator posture**."]{.underline}115 In other words, [its
participants are able to engage in debates where they are able to
**distance themselves from the events that are the subjects of
debates**. Debaters can throw around terms like torture, terrorism,
genocide and nuclear war without blinking. Debate simulations can only
serve to **distance the debaters from real world participation** in the
political contexts they debate about]{.underline}. As William Shanahan
remarks: ...[the topic established a relationship through interpellation
that inhered irrespective of what the particular political affinities of
the debaters were]{.underline}. The relationship was both political and
ethical, and needed to be debated as such. [When we blithely call for
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [F]{.underline}ederal
[G]{.underline}overnment [policymaking, we are not immune to the
**colonialist legacy** that establishes our place on this continent. We
cannot **wish away** the horrific atrocities perpetrated **everyday in
our name** simply by refusing to acknowledge these
implications]{.underline}"(emphasis in original).116 \[end page 118\]
[The "objective" stance of the policymaker is **an impersonal or
imperialist persona**. The policymaker relies upon "acceptable" forms of
evidence, engaging in logical discussion, producing rational
thoughts]{.underline}. As Shanahan, and the Louisville debaters' note,
[such a stance is integrally linked to the **normative**, **historical**
and **contemporary practices of power** that produce and maintain
**varying networks of oppression**]{.underline}. In other words, [the
discursive practices of policy-oriented debate are developed **within**,
**through** and **from** systems of **power and privilege**. Thus, these
practices are **critically implicated in the maintenance of
hegemony**]{.underline}. So, rather than seeing themselves as government
or state actors, Jones and Green choose to perform themselves in debate,
violating the more "objective" stance of the "policymaker" and require
their opponents to do the same.

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate - Education

#### Rigid plans are ineffective for education

[In other cases, the teachers didn\'t alter plans]{.underline}, but
instead attempted to complete all planned activities. As [one teacher
stated, she \"had all of these good ideas on how to enhance the lesson\"
and rushed through the activities, but later realized that \"it would
have been much more effective if I had split it up into two or three
separate lessons]{.underline}.\" [One]{.underline} preservice
[teacher]{.underline}, who finally secured a one-hour block of time to
teach a science lesson in an elementary classroom[, incorporated a
variety of teach ing strategies but later acknowledged that \"even
though the lesson was interesting to students, there was too much
information and. .. the students did not benefit much from
it]{.underline}.\" As happened with others, she ended up having to
re-teach some concepts. But [some teachers couldn\'t alter their
schedules to re-teach.]{.underline} For instance, [a
teacher]{.underline} who was required to follow the district pacing
schedule described her frustration when she realized students did not
understand the concept and she [\"could not go back and re-teach\" the
next day]{.underline} after finding an alternative strategy[. Instead,
she \"had to move on knowing they didn\'t understand.\" Another student
teacher wanted \"to include more hands-on activities and try to spend
more time on each lesson to ensure that students were grasping concepts
and were really ready to move on to the next level,\" but she was
required to teach one mathematics lesson]{.underline} from the book
[each day]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate - Agency

#### Plan based debate relies on a topic wording that inherently gives agency and only gives power to debaters who have access to the state, and limits out a literature base of critical race studies which reaffies structures of oppression.

**Dillard-Know 2014** (Dillard-Knox, Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain
: the challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy
debate.\" (2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161./cdc)

Historically, **[the topics that have been selected have been
constructed utilizing the active voice as opposed to a passive
voice]{.underline}**. An active voice example would be, ―Resolved: The
United States Federal Government should substantially increase statutory
and/or judicial restrictions on the war powers authority of the
President of the United States.‖ A passive voice example would be,
―Resolved: The war powers authority of the President of the United
States should be substantially restricted.‖ **[The active voice topics
require debaters to defend that the United States Federal
Government]{.underline}** ―do something‖ in a more limited capacity,
whereas a passive voice topic could allow debaters the opportunity to
defend a variety of interpretations of ―something being done‖ by or to
the United States Federal Government. **[The active voice topic always
gives the agency to act to the United States Government.]{.underline}**
For students that see themselves as having the possibility to access
these positions of power, acquiring these skills become empowering.
However, many **[marginalized students come to Debate from communities
that have historically been excluded from these positions of power.
Having a passive topic that removes the agency from the United States
Federal Government and allows debaters the flexibility to choose who has
agency thus becomes more empowering to this population of
students]{.underline}**. These students would then be more motivated to
participate in the process of 70 debate through which they can acquire a
variety of skill sets from politician to community activist. Secondly,
t**[he literature base used to construct the topic has failed to include
perspectives found within the race literature,]{.underline}** such as
the legal and political scholarship of Derrick Bell (1992), Cornel West
(1994), and bell hooks (1995). **[Very little, if any, attention has
been given to Critical Race Theory or Critical Legal Studies within the
chosen controversy areas, such as Immigration and Supreme Court
Cases]{.underline}**. **[Even when topic papers are submitted that do
include this literature, they are rarely,]{.underline}** if **[ever
selected in the voting process.]{.underline}** This is important to the
conversation of debating the topic in that the topic paper sets the
definitional guidelines of what is considered topical. If the topic
paper is limited to the language and perspective of the dominant, then
so too will the **[debates be limited to the language and perspective of
the dominant]{.underline}**. Thus, it could be argued that **[the topic
does not account for the discourse strategies of marginalized
populations and could be an additional source of exclusion from
Debate.]{.underline}**

#### The rejection of fiat in debate allows debaters to reclaim agency and empowerment in order to challenge the power structures that fiat enforces.

**Dillard-Knox 2014** (Dillard-Knox, Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain
: the challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy
debate.\" (2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161.)

A major concept that determines strategic decisions in any given debate
is the notion of fiat and the idea of role playing. **[Fiat is a
convention whereas debaters can assume a hypothetical
implementation]{.underline}** of a particular policy. This allows
debaters to focus on whether a policy ―should‖ be adopted and avoids
discussions of whether it ―would‖ be adopted. The purpose of fiat is to
require the debaters to debate the merits of the proposition, and not
the political machinations of how one might garner the votes necessary
for enactment (Freeley and Steinberg, p. 71). **[This notion of fiat is
one place where alternative debate has broken from tradition in order to
employ strategies that focused on in-round actions rather than a
hypothetical implementation of a plan, or proposed policy action. The
debaters were no longer limited to a hypothetical testing of policies
that the United States Federal Government should or should not
enact]{.underline}**. **[Instead, the debaters began challenging the
language and presentational choices made in debates.]{.underline}**
These debaters initiated challenges to traditional concepts regarding
what constitutes valuable debate by incorporating music, drama and
personal narrative. Until recently, Debate was viewed primarily as an
academic game (Snider, 1984). While there is value in the use of game
simulation theory, **[this use of ―gaming‖ as a way to view debating,
allows one to speculate about the ―what-ifs‖ of the future while
ignoring the potential power in dealing with the right
now.]{.underline}** **[Components of alternative debate provide the
tools necessary for acknowledging and proposing solutions for the
problems of right now]{.underline}**. Advocates of alternative debate
see the activity as **[having the 19 potential to be an educational tool
of empowerment]{.underline}** (Warner and Bruschke, 2001). Participants,
who engage in debates from an alternative standpoint, view themselves
not only as players of a game, but agents of social change. This change
occurs in both form and content. In alternative debates, also known as
**[performance debate, students will utilize]{.underline}** what has
come to be called a three-tier process. The three-tier process includes
**[personal experience, organic intellectuals, and academic
intellectuals]{.underline}**. According to Nathan Abrams (1995), organic
intellectuals have four characteristics. They must be a member of an
―aggrieved community.‖ As members of an aggrieved community, they should
**[reflect the needs of that community]{.underline}**. Thirdly, they
attempt to **[challenge the power structures through the dissemination
of subversive ideas]{.underline}**. The final characteristic is that
they strive **[to construct an ―historical block---a coalition of
oppositional groups united around these subversive ideas]{.underline}**.
Academic intellectuals are academic experts in a particular field of
research whose work is published in scholarly journals, non-fiction
books, and other scholarly work, such as: theses, dissertations, and
conference papers. Bartanen (1995) has described this type of knowledge
as ―authoritative evidence from an objective source.‖ Elizabeth Jones of
the University of Louisville described the function of the three-tier
process as a method of validation: A way in which you can validate our
claims, is through the three-tier process. And we talk about personal
experience, organic intellectuals, and academic intellectuals. Let me
give you an analogy. If you place an elephant in the room and send in
\[sic\] three blind folded people into the room, and each of them are
touching a different part of the elephant. And they come back outside
and you ask each different person they gone \[sic\] have a different
idea about what they was \[sic\] talking about. But, if you let those
people converse and bring those three 20 different people together then
you can achieve a greater truth (Reid-Brinkley, 2008, p. 84). 4 **[This
method of validation allows debaters to insert experiences and voices
into debates that have traditionally been left out and/or
marginalized.]{.underline}** This concept comes from critical legal
scholar Mari Matsuda's method of ―looking to the bottom.‖ Matsuda (1987)
argues that, ―those who have experienced discrimination speak with a
special voice to which we should listen (p. 324)‖ The presentation of
argument in alternative debates can encompass the performance of rap
music, poetry, metaphors and other art forms during a round (Polson,
2012). Freeley and Steinberg quote Jones' presentation of the following
rap as a part of her affirmative case in favor of U.S. withdrawal from
NATO: Roma people feel just like me, tired of being deprived of their
liberty. Relegated to ghettos, held as slaves, poor health care leading
to early graves. Prison scars, from prison bars, walking round the
prison yard. No running water, no heat, no jobs, and everything you've
seemed to love, you've lost. While the rich get richer, who's paying the
cost? George Soros, Bill Clinton, to Dick Cheney, the so-called bearers
of democracy. NATO represents the military wing, of the all-powerful
capitalist regime. While you think gangsters listen to rap and sag, They
really wear suits and carry leather bags. Politicians with the power to
pick, define, and choose who will win and who will lose. Not hearing the
Roma or Palestine, I guess it depends how genocide is defined (p.233)5 .
4 Alternative framework used by the University of Louisville and
explanation of that framework as cited by Shanara Reid-Brinkley (2008),
taken from a video of a debate speech given by Elizabeth Jones. Emory
University Vs. University of Louisville, Double-Octa-Finals Ceda
Nationals: Second Negative Rebuttal (Louisville, KY: 2004). 5 Spoken
word piece written by Elizabeth Jones as part of her 1AC. 21 While this
form of presentation is representative of a cultural art form, it is not
limited to just art for art's sake. According to Polson, the use of
musical and narrative forms in performance debate exemplifies a type of
meta-information. An example of this can be seen in the excerpt above.
Jones uses spoken word, not only as a performative piece, but also to
describe the similarities of the relationship of some Blacks with
American institutions to the relationship of the Roma people with NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization). These similarities are not
connections that are easily recognized by outsiders of either
subordinate group. Secondly, Jones plays on the word ―gangsters.‖
Instead of what people typically thinks of as a gangster, she applies it
to politicians. The visual that she creates with her description of
gangsters ―wearing suits and carrying leather bags‖ as opposed to
―listen(ing) to rap and sag(ging),‖ is part of the metainformation that
Polson has articulated. Polson goes on to say, ―the form provides
instruction to the listener about how to perceive and interpret the
debate (p. 16).‖ The relationship that is created within Jones' spoken
word piece, informs the judge that there are more ways to discuss
justifying the United States Federal Government's ―full withdrawal from
NATO‖ than by any singular understanding of the topic, as framed by the
authors of the topic paper.

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate - Activism

#### Modes of activism and engagement for youths have been limited by the affirmative's plan text-state based methods

#### **Kennelly 09** (Jacqueline Kennelly (2009) Good Citizen/Bad Activist: The Cultural Role of the State in Youth Activism, The Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies , page 144-145, \< <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/10714410902827135?scroll=top&needAccess=true>\>)

The production and regulation of the good citizen within the Canadian
state is accomplished through a variety of cultural means, which emanate
from schooling and also extend beyond its bound- aries. The possibility
for active participation within the state, while explicated as an ideal
of the new civics curricula, comes with a set of limits and expectations
about what such participation looks like. **[Drawing on histories of
liberalism and current ideologies of neoliberalism, the active citizen
of contemporary civics curricula is one who engages with the state
through self-regulated acts of responsible citizenship that are limited
to individual encounters with the electoral process, charitable
community work, and=or participation through formal aspects of the
political system, such as official parties]{.underline}.** This article
has also sought to demonstrate how histories of racism and classism
continue to shape the experiences of young people attempting to take up
concepts and practices of citizenship. The submerged cultural messages
that young people encounter provide evidence for them that the rewards
and benefits of such participation are aligned with stratifications of
class and race. Although the experiences of working class, Aboriginal
and racialized young people are diverse, participants' reflections
within this research project highlight the ways in which their
experiences within the school system and among their peers can reinforce
the belief that the forms of belonging to be found within the idea of
the good citizen is not for them. This is because **[good
citizenship]{.underline}**, as it is elaborated within the cultural
sphere, **[continues to be heavily regulated and governed through the
languages and contingent discourses of normative liberal
principles]{.underline}**, which are in turn grounded within a history
of symbolic domination that perpetuates class and race disadvantages.
[Even those who venture into the realm of activism receive their warning
about where the limits to legitimate citizenship lie. Through practices
of policing and the justice system, young people are given a clear
message about the boundaries of permissible citizenship.]{.underline}
What is of interest, I would suggest, is that the recent rise in civics
curricula across Western liberal democratic states (including Canada)
indicates some degree of uncertainty about how well the state is
managing to encourage the appropriate self- regulation of its own
citizens. Particularly in the face of **[policy
priorities]{.underline}** that have resulted in growing disparities
between rich and poor, alongside the ever-increasing policing of borders
that have emerged in the post--9=11 world, perhaps the recent increase
in civics education ought to be understood, at least in part, as a form
of governance that is intended to quell the emergent strands of critique
that saw their expression through the mass mobilizations in Seattle,
Quebec, and elsewhere. It is perhaps indicative of the urgency of our
times that the cultural space within which young activists
work---permeated by state norms and heavily policed---functions as a
form of containment for any dissident expression that threatens to
undermine state legitimacy. It thus **[counters the potential for
activism to generate a more diverse and democratic public sphere, an
unfortunate consequence in a time where all creative energies are
required to resolve the dilemmas we currently face.]{.underline}**

#### Debates about critical pedagogy and activism are vital to stopping [anti-democratic norms]{.underline} --- addresses [argumentative agency]{.underline} and leads to [real change.]{.underline}

[Extreme power is now showcased through the mechanisms of
ever-proliferating cultural/educational apparatuses and the anti-public
intellectuals who support them and are in turn rewarded by the elites
who finance such apparatuses.]{.underline} The war at home is made
visible in the show of force aimed at civilian populations, including
students, workers, and others considered disposable or a threat to the
new authoritarianism. [Its most powerful allies appear to be the
intellectuals, institutions, cultural apparatuses and new media
technologies that constitute the sites of public pedagogy, which produce
the formative culture necessary for authoritarianism to thrive. While a
change in consciousness does not guarantee a change in either one\'s
politics or society]{.underline}, it is a crucial precondition for
connecting what it means to think otherwise to conditions that make it
possible to act otherwise. The education deficit must be seen as
intertwined with a political deficit, serving to make many oppressed
individuals complicit with oppressive ideologies. As the late Cornelius
Castoriadis made clear, democracy requires \"critical thinkers capable
of putting existing institutions into question\.... while simultaneously
creating the conditions for individual and social autonomy.\"(41)
[Nothing will change politically or economically until new and emerging
social movements take seriously the need to develop a language of
radical reform and create new public spheres that support the knowledge,
skills and critical thought that are necessary features of a democratic
formative culture. Getting beyond the big lie as a precondition for
critical thought, civic engagement and a more realized democracy will
mean more than correcting distortions, misrepresentations and falsehoods
produced by politicians, media talking heads and anti-public
intellectuals.]{.underline} It will also require addressing how new
sites of pedagogy have become central to any viable notion of agency,
politics and democracy itself. This is not a matter of elevating
cultural politics over material relations of power as much as it is a
rethinking of how power deploys culture and how culture as a mode of
education positions power. James Baldwin, the legendary African-American
writer and civil rights activist, argued that the big lie points to a
crisis of American identity and politics and is symptomatic of \"a
backward society\" that has descended into madness, \"especially when
one is forced to lie about one\'s aspect of anybody\'s history,
\[because you then\] must lie about it all.\"(42) He goes on to argue
\"that one of the paradoxes of education \[is\] that precisely at the
point when you begin to develop a conscience, you must find yourself at
war with your society. It is your responsibility to change society if
you think of yourself as an educated person.\"(43) What Baldwin
recognizes is that learning has the possibility to trigger a critical
engagement with oneself, others and the larger society education becomes
in this instance more than a method or tool for domination but a
politics, a fulcrum for democratic social change. Tragically, in our
current climate \"learning\" merely contributes to a vast reserve of
manipulation and self-inflicted ignorance. [Our education deficit is
neither reducible to the failure of particular types of teaching nor the
decent into madness by the spokespersons for the new authoritarianism.
Rather, it is about how matters of knowledge, values and ideology can be
struggled over as issues of power and politics. Surviving the current
education deficit will depend on progressives using history, memory and
knowledge not only to reconnect intellectuals to the everyday needs of
ordinary people, but also to jumpstart social movements by making
education central to organized politics and the quest for a radical
democracy.]{.underline}

**Active participation and genuine cooperation do not occur through
fiat, their framework crushes democracy and interconnectedness,
disempowering minority discourses.**

**Arnult, 2003** \[Lynne, "Cruelty, Horror, and the Will to Redemption."
Hypatia 18.2 (2003) 155-188\] EC

**[As social analysts have pointed out, the dominant philosophical and
political discourses in the United States reflect and reinforce a
perspective that Nancy Hartsock calls \"the standpoint of exchange\":
these discourses constitute human beings as fundamentally separate,
prudential, interest-driven monads who pursue their own self-chosen
conception of the good life and who interact with one another only when
there is a momentary convergence of interest]{.underline}** (1985,
chap.2). Because of the dominance of \"the standpoint of exchange\" in
U.S. American culture, not surprisingly we are particularly susceptible
to counterfeit claims of community. According to John Freie,
\"\[l\]acking genuine community, yet longing for the meaning and sense
of connectedness that it creates, feeling of community? people become
vulnerable to even the merest suggestion of community\" and to mistaking
the /feeling/ of connectedness or community for the genuine article
(1998, 2[). Although the feeling of connectedness is necessary to
communal bonds and identity, this emotional dimension is not sufficient:
community is \"an interlocking pattern of just human relationships in
which people have at least a minimal sense of consensus within a
definable territory]{.underline}. People within a community actively
participate and cooperate with others to create their own self-worth, a
sense of caring about others, and a feeling for the spirit of
connectedness\" (Freie 1998, 23). [What bears emphasizing here is that
active participation and genuine cooperation do not happen by verbal
fiat; in order for social interactions to be substantively (and not
merely abstractly) dialogical and democratic, the heterogeneity of human
viewpoints, interests, and desires must be recognized?and this, in turn,
requires allowing for the epistemic significance of social
divisions.]{.underline} More specifically, it necessitates
acknowledging, on the one hand, the inescapably \*\[End Page 176\]\*
[limited, partial, and socially embedded perspectives of human
deliberators and, on the other hand, the role that social, political,
and economic power plays in the abilities of dominant social groups to
create defining discourses and in the abilities of subordinated groups
to resist the use of marginalizing or subjugating discourses and to
create discourses that give voice to their experiences, interests, and
needs in an authentic way. Unless the concrete social and institutional
conditions and constraints that govern communicative interactions are
themselves subject to on-going thematization, critique, and change, and
until, therefore, members of subordinated groups are able to represent
their experiences, interests, and needs in a non-distorted,
non-repressed way]{.underline} (Arnault 1989), [whatever feelings of
cohesion, solidarity, and connectedness have been generated in any given
situation will ultimately be counterfeit.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate - Detachment Turn 

#### Failure to begin analysis from the experiences of the oppressed makes violence inevitable.

#### Traditional debate revolves around discourse that distances the reality of suffering and violence, narratives in debate allow for inclusion of minority perspectives

**Dillard-Knox 14** (Dillard-Knox, Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain :
the challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy
debate.\" (2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161./cdc)

There are three types of arguments that Zompetti (2004) used to define
personalized arguments: ―**[traditional debate excludes certain types of
evidence]{.underline}**, traditional debate **[privileges affluent
individuals, and]{.underline}** traditional debate **[ignores the
reality of many individuals who are already at a disadvantage in the
activity]{.underline}** (p.28).‖ The first 62 argument type, that
―debate excludes certain types of evidence,‖ maintains that **[the
Debate community values academic evidence and devalues other forms of
knowledge]{.underline}** that come from what Antonio Gramsci (1978)
calls organic intellectuals. The type of organic intellectuals being
referred to here are the ones that Gramsci identifies as the permanent
persuaders, a group of organic intellectuals that grows within the
subordinated class(es). He goes on to state, ―Organic intellectuals in
the subordinated class(es) are defined by social function rather than
the characteristics of formal education, cultural distinction, or social
status (p. 42).‖ **[Alternative debaters]{.underline}** have introduced
some forms of hip hop as a source of organic intellectualism that
**[provides a perspective that is counter to that of the dominant
ideological constructs of the world]{.underline}**. The second argument
type argues that ―traditional debate privileges affluent individuals.‖
This argument encompasses things associated with material privileges.
Some of the material privileges include things such as the financial
costs associated with attending debate camps, travelling to a large
number of national tournaments, access to the amount of ―free time‖ to
prepare for debate tournaments in order to be nationally competitive,
etc. As mentioned above, learning the language of Debate requires
extensive training, debate camp is one of the mechanisms used to train
debaters but camps generally cost between \$1500-3000 to attend.
Additionally, competitive success typically depends upon one's ability
to travel to the national circuit tournaments. The reasoning is that the
best of the best compete at these tournaments, as opposed to the
regional tournament circuit. Lastly, debaters spend anywhere from 40-100
hours per week in preparation for tournaments. Unfortunately, there are
many debaters who have 63 academic, familial and work obligations
outside of Debate that prohibit them from being able to commit that
amount of time towards preparing for debates. Finally, the argument that
―debate ignores the reality of many individuals who are already at a
disadvantage in the activity‖ makes claims about the way that
traditional debate does not allow for the implications that race, class,
gender, sexuality, and disability can have on how Debate, in general,
and debate tournaments, more specifically, function. These arguments
typically make claims about what types of perspectives and Debate norms
develop from positions of privilege. Tim Wise (2005) while discussing
his experiences in Debate argues that **[Debate is an ―extraordinarily
white‖ activity]{.underline}** (p. 69). He goes on to state, the reason
that I call this process a white one is **[because white people (and
especially affluent ones), much more so than folks of color, have the
luxury of looking at life or death issues of war, peace, famine,
unemployment or criminal justice as a game, a mere exercise in
intellectual and rhetorical banter...kids of color and working class
youth of all colors are simply not as likely to gravitate to an activity
where pretty much half the time they'll be forced to take positions
that, if implemented in the real world, might devastate their
communities]{.underline}** (p. 71-72). These three argument types are
usually made by debaters identifying themselves as being affected by
these patterns of exclusion. Thus, it is believed by debate scholars
that these debaters are using their ―victimage‖ to gain a competitive
advantage in debate rounds (Zompetti, 2004. p. 30). These scholars have
argued that these narratives of exclusion are not contestable because
one cannot effectively debate another's personal experience. Recalling
Smitherman's definition of narrative sequencing, as the relating of
events (real or hypothetical) to explain a point, to persuade holders of
opposing views to one's own point of view, and in general to ―win
friends and influence people‖ (p. 148), 64 **[narratives should be
considered valuable components of debate strategy and
technique]{.underline}**. However, while these scholars acknowledge
these narratives as important, they fail to accurately understand and
portray the function of these narratives, thus missing the value in
using narratives in debates. The sociolinguistics literature offers an
alternative perspective for understanding the function of these
narrative discourses. While most Debate scholars would argue that these
narratives in debate only serve as personal testimony, or complaints of
oppression, the sociolinguistic literature surrounding identity and
language would suggest that **[these narratives are ways of positioning
the self in the context of a larger interactional scheme.]{.underline}**
Therefore, as Bucholtz and Hall (2005) suggests, when approaching
identity---in Debate---to ―consider a relational and sociocultural
phenomenon (p. 585). This phenomenon emerges and circulates in discourse
contexts of interaction rather than as a stable structure located
primarily in the individual psyche or in fixed social categories (p.
586).‖ **[Conceptualizing personalized arguments in this way allows one
to understand that all language interactions in debates communicate at
least part of one's identity, whether it is explicit or implicit.
Therefore, debates are always ―personal‖. However, criticizing one group
of students for positioning their arguments within a larger social,
political, or cultural context creates an unfair barrier for inclusion
into Debate for that group.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate -- Speaking For Others

#### Speaking for others negatively affects and excludes those that are being spoken for

Consider the following true stories: 1. Anne Cameron, [a]{.underline}
very gifted [white Canadian author, writes]{.underline} several [first
person]{.underline} accounts of the lives [of Native Canadian
women]{.underline}. At the 1988 International Feminist Book Fair in
Montreal, [a group of Native Canadian writers ask Cameron
to]{.underline}, in their words, \"[move over]{.underline}\" on the
grounds [that her writings are disempowering for Native
authors]{.underline}. She agrees.2 2. After the 1989 elections in Panama
are overturned by Manuel Noriega, [U.S. President]{.underline} George
[Bush declares]{.underline} in a public address that Noriega\'s actions
constitute an \"outrageous fraud\" and that \"[the voice of the
Panamanian people have spoken.]{.underline}\" \"The Panamanian people,\"
he tells us, \"want democracy [and]{.underline} not tyranny, and want
Noriega out.\" He [proceeds to]{.underline} plan [the invasion of
Panama]{.underline}. 3. At a recent symposium at my university, a
prestigious theorist was invited to give a lecture on the political
problems of post-modernism. Those of us in the audience, including many
white women and people of oppressed nationalities and races, wait in
eager anticipation for what he has to contribute to this important
discussion. To our disappointment, he introduces his lecture by
explaining that he can not cover the assigned topic, because as a white
male he does not feel that he can speak for the feminist and
post-colonial perspectives which have launched the critical
interrogation of postmodernism\'s politics. He lectures instead on
architecture. [These examples demonstrate the range of current practices
of speaking for others in our society]{.underline}. While the
prerogative of speaking for others remains unquestioned in the citadels
of colonial administration, among activists and in the academy it
elicits a growing unease and, in some communities of discourse, it is
being rejected. [There is a strong]{.underline}, albeit contested,
[current within feminism which holds that speaking for
others]{.underline}\-\--even for other women\-\--is arrogant, vain,
[unethical, and]{.underline} politically [illegitimate. Feminist
scholarship]{.underline} has a liberatory agenda which [almost
requires]{.underline} that [women]{.underline} scholars [speak on behalf
of other women]{.underline}, and yet the dangers of speaking across
differences of race, culture, sexuality, and power are becoming
increasingly clear to all. In feminist magazines such as Sojourner, it
is common to find articles and letters in which the author states that
she can only speak for herself. In her important paper, \"Dyke
Methods,\" Joyce Trebilcot offers a philosophical articulation of this
view. She renounces for herself the practice of [speaking for
others]{.underline} within a lesbian feminist community, arguing that
she \"will not try to get other wimmin to accept my beliefs in place of
their own\" on the grounds that to do so [would be to practice a kind of
discursive coercion and even a violence]{.underline}.3 Feminist
discourse is not the only site in which the problem of speaking for
others has been acknowledged and addressed. [In
anthropology]{.underline} there is similar discussion about whether it
is possible to speak for others either adequately or justifiably. Trinh
T. Minh-ha explains the grounds for skepticism when she says that
anthropology [is]{.underline} \"mainly [a conversation of \`us\' with
\`us\' about \`them,\' of the white man]{.underline} with the white man
about the primitive-nature man\...[in which \`them\' is
silenced]{.underline}. \`Them\' always stands on the other side of the
hill, naked and speechless\...\`them\' is only admitted among \`us\',
the discussing subjects, when accompanied or introduced by an
\`us\'\...\"4 Given this analysis, [even ethnographies written by
progressive anthropologists are]{.underline} a priori
[regressive]{.underline} because of the structural features of
anthropological discursive practice. The recognition that there is a
problem in speaking for others has followed from the widespread
acceptance of two claims. First, [there has been a growing awareness
that where one speaks from affects both the meaning and truth of what
one says]{.underline}, and thus that one cannot assume an ability to
transcend her location. In other words, [a speaker\'s
location]{.underline} (which I take here to refer to her social location
or social identity) [has an epistemically significant impact on that
speaker\'s claims, and can serve either to authorize or dis-authorize
one\'s]{.underline} The Problem of Speaking For Others
http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 3 of 26 1/30/08 11:09 AM
[speech]{.underline}. The creation of Women\'s Studies and African
American Studies departments were founded on this very belief: that both
[the study of and the advocacy for the oppressed must come to be done
principally by the oppressed themselves]{.underline}, and that we must
finally acknowledge that systematic divergences in social location
between speakers and those spoken for will have a significant effect on
the content of what is said. The unspoken premise here is simply that a
speaker\'s location is epistemically salient. I shall explore this issue
further in the next section. The second claim holds that not only is
location epistemically salient, but certain [privileged locations
are]{.underline} discursively dangerous.5 In particular, the practice of
privileged persons speaking for or on behalf of less privileged persons
has actually resulted (in many cases) in [increasing]{.underline} or
reenforcing [the]{.underline} oppression of the [group spoken
for]{.underline}. This was part of the argument made against Anne
Cameron\'s speaking for Native women: Cameron\'s intentions were never
in question, but the effects of her writing were argued to be harmful to
the needs of Native authors because it is Cameron rather than they who
will be listened to and whose books will be bought by readers interested
in Native women. [Persons from dominant groups who speak for others are
often treated as authenticating presences that confer legitimacy and
credibility on the demands of subjugated speakers; such speaking for
others does nothing to disrupt the discursive hierarchies that operate
in public spaces.]{.underline} For this reason, the work of privileged
authors who speak on behalf of the oppressed is becoming increasingly
criticized by members of those oppressed groups themselves.6 As social
theorists, [we are authorized by virtue of our academic positions to
develop theories that express and encompass the ideas, needs, and goals
of others.]{.underline}

#### Accurate representation becomes skewed when speaking for others

**Alcoff 91** - (Linda Alcoff, "The Problem of Speaking for Others",
*Cultural Critique,* pp.5-32) \<
https://www.jstor.org/stable/1354221?item_view=read_online&refreqid=excelsior%3A1d2ad6f025cbcbae6e9264496e578d7c\>)

However, we must begin to ask ourselves whether this is ever a
legitimate authority, and if so, what are the criteria for legitimacy?
In particular, is it ever valid to speak for others who are unlike me or
who are less privileged than me? We might try to delimit this problem as
only arising when a more privileged person speaks for a less privileged
one. In this case, we might say that I should only speak for groups of
which I am a member. But this does not tell us how groups themselves
should be delimited. For example, can a white woman speak for all women
simply by virtue of being a woman? If not, how narrowly should we draw
the The Problem of Speaking For Others
http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 4 of 26 1/30/08 11:09 AM
categories? The complexity and multiplicity of group identifications
could result in \"communities\" composed of single individuals.
Moreover, the concept of groups assumes specious notions about clear-cut
boundaries and \"pure\" identities. I am a Panamanian-American and a
person of mixed ethnicity and race: half white/Angla and half Panamanian
mestiza. The criterion of group identity leaves many unanswered
questions for a person such as myself, since I have membership in many
conflicting groups but my membership in all of them is problematic.
[Group identities and boundaries are ambiguous and permeable, and
decisions about demarcating identity are always partly
arbitrary.]{.underline} Another problem concerns how specific an
identity needs to be to confer epistemic authority. Reflection on such
problems quickly reveals that no easy solution to the problem of
speaking for others can be found by simply restricting the practice to
speaking for groups of which one is a member. Adopting the position that
one should only speak for oneself raises similarly difficult questions.
If I don\'t speak for those less privileged than myself, am I abandoning
my political responsibility to speak out against oppression, a
responsibility incurred by the very fact of my privilege? If I should
not speak for others, should I restrict myself to following their lead
uncritically? Is my greatest contribution to move over and get out of
the way? And if so, what is the best way to do this\-\--to keep silent
or to deconstruct my own discourse? The answers to these questions will
certainly depend on who is asking them. While some of us may want to
undermine, for example, the U.S. government\'s practice of speaking for
the \"Third world,\" we may not want to undermine someone such as
Rigoberta Menchu\'s ability to speak for Guatemalan Indians.7 So the
question arises about whether all instances of speaking for should be
condemned and, if not, how we can justify a position which would
repudiate some speakers while accepting others. In order to answer these
questions [we need to become clearer on the epistemological and
metaphysical issues which are involved in the articulation of the
problem of speaking for others]{.underline}, issues which most often
remain implicit. I will attempt to make these issues clear before
turning to discuss some of the possible responses to the problem and
advancing a provisional, procedural solution of my own. But first I need
to explain further my framing of the problem. The Problem of Speaking
For Others http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 5 of 26 1/30/08
11:09 AM In the examples used above, there may appear to be a conflation
between the issue of speaking for others and the issue of speaking about
others. This conflation was intentional on my part, because [it is
difficult to distinguish speaking about from speaking for in all
cases]{.underline}. There is an ambiguity in the two phrases: when one
is speaking for another one may be describing their situation and thus
also speaking about them. In fact, it may be impossible to speak for
another without simultaneously conferring information about them.
Similarly, [when one is speaking about another, or]{.underline} simply
trying to [describe their situation]{.underline} or some aspect of it,
[one may also be]{.underline} speaking in place of them, i.e. [speaking
for them]{.underline}. One may be speaking about another as an advocate
or a messenger if the person cannot speak for herself. Thus I would
maintain that if [the practice of speaking for others is problematic, so
too]{.underline} must be [the practice of speaking about
others.]{.underline}8 This is partly the case because of what has been
called [the \"crisis of representation]{.underline}.\" For in both the
practice of speaking for as well as the practice of speaking about
others, I am [engaging in]{.underline} the act of [representing the
other\'s needs, goals, situation, and]{.underline} in fact, [who they
are]{.underline}, based on my own situated interpretation. In
post-structuralist terms, I am [participating in the construction of
their subject-positions rather than simply discovering their true
selves]{.underline}. Once we pose it as a problem of representation, we
see that, not only are speaking for and speaking about analytically
close, so too are the practices of speaking for others and speaking for
myself. For, in speaking for myself, I am also representing my self in a
certain way, as occupying a specific subject-position, having certain
characteristics and not others, and so on. In speaking for myself, I
(momentarily) create my self\-\--just as much as when I speak for others
I create them as a public, discursive self, a self which is more unified
than any subjective experience can support. And this public self will in
most cases have an effect on the self experienced as interiority. The
point here is that the problem of representation underlies all cases of
speaking for, whether I am speaking for myself or for others. This is
not to suggest that all representations are fictions: they have very
real material effects, as well as material origins, but they are always
mediated in complex ways by discourse, power, and location. However, the
problem of speaking for others is more specific than the problem of
representation generally, and requires its own The Problem of Speaking
For Others http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 6 of 26 1/30/08
11:09 AM particular analysis. There is one final point I want to make
before we can pursue this analysis. The way I have articulated this
problem may imply that individuals make conscious choices about their
discursive practice free of ideology and the constraints of material
reality. This is not what I wish to imply. [The problem of speaking for
others is a social one, the options available to us are socially
constructed, and the practices we engage in cannot be understood as
simply the results of autonomous individual choice.]{.underline} Yet to
replace both \"I\" and \"we\" with a passive voice that erases agency
results in [an erasure of responsibility and accountability for one\'s
speech]{.underline}, an erasure I would strenuously argue against (there
is too little responsibility-taking already in Western practice!). When
we sit down to write, or get up to speak, we experience ourselves as
making choices. We may experience hesitation from fear of being
criticized or from fear of exacerbating a problem we would like to
remedy, or we may experience a resolve to speak despite existing
obstacles, but in many cases we experience having the possibility to
speak or not to speak. On the one hand, a theory which explains this
experience as involving autonomous choices free of material structures
would be false and ideological, but on the other hand, if we do not
acknowledge the activity of choice and the experience of individual
doubt, we are denying a reality of our experiential lives.9 So I see the
argument of this paper as addressing that small space of discursive
agency we all experience, however multi-layered, fictional, and
constrained it in fact is. Ultimately, the question of speaking for
others bears crucially on the possibility of political effectivity.
[Both collective action and coalitions would seem to require the
possibility of speaking for]{.underline}. Yet influential postmodernists
such as Gilles Deleuze have characterized as \"absolutely fundamental:
[the indignity of speaking for others]{.underline}\"10 and important
feminist theorists have renounced the practice as [irretrievably
harmful]{.underline}. What is at stake in rejecting or validating
speaking for others as a discursive practice? To answer this, we must
become clearer on the epistemological and metaphysical claims which are
implicit in the articulation of the problem. I. The Problem of Speaking

#### The position of a speaker can change the meaning or distort the context of what they are speaking about

**Alcoff 91** - (Linda Alcoff, "The Problem of Speaking for Others",
*Cultural Critique,* pp.5-32) \<
https://www.jstor.org/stable/1354221?item_view=read_online&refreqid=excelsior%3A1d2ad6f025cbcbae6e9264496e578d7c\>)

Critical theory, discourses of empowerment, psychoanalytic theory,
post-structuralism, feminist and anti-colonialist theories have all
concurred on this point. Who is speaking to whom turns out to be as
important for meaning and truth as what is said; in fact [what is said
turns out to change according to who is speaking and who is
listening]{.underline}. Following Foucault, I will call these \"rituals
of speaking\" to identify discursive practices of speaking or writing
which involve not only the text or utterance but their position within a
social space which includes the persons involved in, acting upon, and/or
affected by the words. Two elements within these rituals will deserve
our attention: [the positionality or location of the speaker and the
discursive context. We]{.underline} can take the latter to [refer to the
connections and relations of involvement between the utterance/text
and]{.underline} other utterances and texts as well as [the material
practices]{.underline} in the relevant environment, which should not be
confused with an environment spatially adjacent to the particular
discursive event. [Rituals of speaking are constitutive of
meaning]{.underline}, the meaning of the words spoken as well as the
meaning of the event. This claim requires us to shift the ontology of
meaning from its location in a text or utterance to a larger space, a
space which includes the text or utterance but which also includes the
discursive context. And an important implication of this claim is that
meaning must be understood as plural and shifting, since a single text
can engender diverse meanings given diverse contexts. Not only what is
emphasized, noticed, and how it is understood will be affected by the
location of both speaker and hearer, but the truth-value or epistemic
status will also be affected. **[For example, in many situations when a
woman speaks the presumption is against her; when a man speaks he is
usually taken seriously]{.underline}** (unless his speech patterns mark
him as socially inferior by dominant standards). When writers from
oppressed races and nationalities have insisted that all writing is
political the claim has been dismissed as foolish or grounded in
ressentiment or it is simply ignored; when prestigious European
philosophers say that all writing is political it is taken up as a new
and original \"truth\" (Judith Wilson calls this \"the intellectual
equivalent of the \`cover The Problem of Speaking For Others
http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 8 of 26 1/30/08 11:09 AM
record\'.\")11 [The rituals of speaking which involve the location of
speaker and listeners affect whether a claim is taken as true,
well-reasoned, a compelling argument, or a significant
idea]{.underline}. Thus, how what is said gets heard depends on who says
it, and who says it will affect the style and language in which it is
stated**[. The discursive style in which some European
post-structuralists have made the claim that all writing is political
marks it as important and likely to be true for a certain (powerful)
milieu; whereas the style in which African-American writers made the
same claim marked their speech as dismissable in the eyes of the same
milieu]{.underline}**. This point might be conceded by those who admit
to the political mutability of interpretation, but they might continue
to maintain that truth is a different matter altogether. And they would
be right that [acknowledging the effect of location on meaning and even
on whether something is taken as true within a particular discursive
context does not entail that the \"actual\" truth of the claim is
contingent upon its context.]{.underline} However, this objection
presupposes a particular conception of truth, one in which the truth of
a statement can be distinguished from its interpretation and its
acceptance. Such a concept would require truth to be independent of the
speakers\' or listeners\' embodied and perspectival location. Thus, the
question of whether location bears simply on what is taken to be true or
what is really true, and whether such a distinction can be upheld,
involves the very difficult problem of the meaning of truth. In the
history of Western philosophy, there have existed multiple, competing
definitions and ontologies of truth: correspondence, idealist,
pragmatist, coherentist, and consensual notions. The dominant modernist
view has been that truth represents a relationship of correspondence
between a proposition and an extra-discursive reality. On this view,
truth is about a realm completely independent of human action and
expresses things \"as they are in themselves,\" that is, free of human
interpretation. Arguably since Kant, more obviously since Hegel, it has
been widely accepted that an understanding of truth which requires it to
be free of human interpretation leads inexorably to skepticism, since it
makes truth inaccessible by definition. This created an impetus to
reconfigure the ontology of truth, from a locus outside human
interpretation to one within it. Hegel, for example, understood truth as
an \"identity in difference\" between subjective and objective elements.
Thus, The Problem of Speaking For Others
http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 9 of 26 1/30/08 11:09 AM in
the Hegelian aftermath, so-called subjective elements, or the
historically specific conditions in which human knowledge occurs, are no
longer rendered irrelevant or even obstacles to truth.

### 2NC -- AT: Deliberative Democracy

#### Deliberative democracy uses the façade of [pseudo-participation]{.underline} to disregard the perspectives of marginalized communities, [limit]{.underline} the alternatives under consideration, and further [hegemonic discourse]{.underline}

**Kadlec and Friedman 7** (Alison Kadlec, visiting professor in the
political science department at Macalester College and an adjunct
professor in the political science departments at the University of
Minnesota, Baruch College and Hunter College, Will Friedman, Ph.D. is
the president of Public Agenda, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization,
"Deliberative Democracy and the Problem of Power" Journal of Public
Deliberation, Vol. 3 vol. 2, Issue 1, article 8, p. 6-7,
<https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250&context=engl_facpub)///Aakash>

To critics such as Iris Marion Young and Lynn Sanders, most versions of
**[deliberative democracy]{.underline}** fail doubly. Because they
**[reproduce undemocratic power relations]{.underline}** that beleaguer
our larger society, [they are neither]{.underline} sufficiently
[inclusive to be democratic nor meaningful enough to be genuinely
deliberative]{.underline}. The specifics of their critiques are
instructive. Young, for instance, argues that: • First, [in the real
world of politics, "powerful elites representing structurally dominant
social segments have significant influence over political processes and
decisions]{.underline}." [Therefore, **deliberation is a luxury to which
only political elites have access**]{.underline} and, given the
structural inequalities, **[why should disempowered
individuals]{.underline}** and groups be asked to **[trust so-called
"rational dialogue" with those in whose interest it is to perpetuate
unjust economic and political arrangements]{.underline}**? • Second,
while those deliberative settings that are obviously exclusionary are
troubling, more pernicious yet are the claims that formal inclusion in
deliberative processes guarantee that all voices will be heard.
[Deliberation is always structurally biased in favor of those with
greater resources and power]{.underline} and to pretend otherwise is
morally specious. • Third, [even if legitimate deliberative settings
were to emerge]{.underline} against these odds, "[existing social and
economic structures have set unacceptable constraints on the terms of
deliberation]{.underline} and its agenda." On **[what terms are
underserved communities to expect that deliberation will accomplish
anything substantive if, for example, the constraints imposed by federal
law make it impossible to administer policies that embody a commitment
to]{.underline}** social **[and economic justice]{.underline}**? •
Finally, even if deliberative democracy is able to redress the problem
of constrained alternatives by proposing the creation of deliberative
settings free from "the immediacy of the given economic imperatives and
power structures," free inquiry is still not possible given that those
deliberating are entrenched in a hegemonic discourse "which itself is a
complex product of structural inequality." (Young, 2003: 108-15) Lynn
Sanders adds to these points that **[an ironic antidemocratic appeal is
at work in the undergirding principles of deliberative democracy
itself]{.underline}**. In her view, [the rules governing deliberation
are steeped in an]{.underline} aristocratic, [elitist tradition in which
legitimate democratic discussion must be calm, rational, moderate, and
guided by mutual respect.5 And this,]{.underline} says Sanders[, is
culturally biased in favor of those with greater resources]{.underline}
and power **[because deliberative democracy fails to take into account
the differences in]{.underline}** status and **[hierarchy that shape how
we communicate]{.underline}**. Therefore, Taking **[deliberation as a
signal of democratic practice paradoxically works
undemocratically]{.underline}**, [discrediting on seemingly democratic
grounds the views of those who are less likely to present their
arguments in ways that we recognize as characteristically
deliberative.]{.underline} In our political culture, [these citizens are
likely to be those who are already underrepresented in formal political
institutions and who are systematically materially
disadvantaged]{.underline}, **[namely women; racial minorities,
especially Blacks; and poorer people]{.underline}**. (Sanders, 1997:
349) While "insidious prejudices" may incline those with more power to
discount the arguments of those with less, more problematic yet is the
possibility that [because of the subtlety of this kind of exercise of
power "this prejudice may be unrecognized by those citizens whose views
are disregarded as well as by other citizens]{.underline}"---i.e.,
[marginalized citizens may themselves internalize and accept such
"insidious prejudices" as norms]{.underline}, and thereby fail to see
the ways in which their interests are violated or eclipsed (Sanders,
1997: 353). Thus, in addition to more or less formal and obvious forms
of exclusion that undermine deliberation, "[**hegemonic discourse**" can
constrain the alternatives under consideration and even manipulate the
least powerful in ways that violate their interests in virtually
undetectable ways.]{.underline}6 What if, then, deliberative democracy
excludes under the guise of inclusion and stifles the perception of
legitimate grievances while making essentially empty gestures toward
free and open inquiry? The practical result, say critics like Sanders,
is that both participatory democrats and democratic elitists are
satisfied; the former can imagine that citizens are being included in a
process of grappling with common problems, while the latter can be
comforted with the knowledge that the rules of the game are rigged to
prevent the inclusion and/or effective participation of non-elites. Such
concerns cast light on the extent to which much that passes for
deliberation can actually marginalize and even exclude the perspectives
of those individuals and groups who are already at a disadvantage, such
as minorities, women and the poor. The concern is that **[in a society
that is structured by deep inequalities, such as ours, formal inclusion,
even when it exists, is not enough to guarantee everyone the opportunity
to deliberate as equals]{.underline}** [because the more powerful
interests always have greater influence in the deliberative
process.]{.underline} From this perspective, then, [deliberative
democracy suffers fundamental problems of legitimacy. Worse, yet, it
masks those problems behind a façade of
pseudoparticipation]{.underline}.

#### Deliberative Democracy is constrained by officially sanctioned frameworks and has [minimal influence]{.underline} on genuine power politics

Social intelligence is not stimulated in a political vacuum; rather, it
is largely brought into being as citizens confront common problems.
Therefore, while the development of social intelligence will be an
indispensable feature of any enduring process of change, the ongoing
expanding and maturing of civic capacity must be accompanied by a range
of concrete opportunities to effect real change in specific situations
in the near-term. Indeed, **[without the promise of concrete payoffs
citizens will be less inclined to embark on deliberative undertakings in
the first place]{.underline}**; and [without instances of concrete
results, citizens will be unlikely to sustain deliberation over
time]{.underline}. Moreover, and particularly relevant to our present
purposes, the immediate problems posed to deliberation by power politics
come into focus when we realize that, typically, **[those with real
power to shape policy are under no obligation to respond to the outcomes
of even the most conscientiously designed instances of public
deliberation]{.underline}**. Rather, [in most instances deliberative
processes are such that decision-makers and influencers can choose to
respond to them or not at their discretion]{.underline}. The result is
that [the potential role that deliberation might play in public life is
diminished as power politics picks up where deliberation leaves
off]{.underline}. There are exceptions in which a straighter line can be
drawn between deliberation and change in the form of new public
policies, which Archon Fung calls "Empowered Participatory Governance"
and Joshua Cohen calls "Directly Deliberative Polyarchy." These are
situations in which government officials commit to citizen deliberation
as part of a formal decision-making process (Cohen and Fung, 2004).
Cohen and Fung pose such official empowerment of citizen deliberation as
the key means by which deliberation may have appropriate impacts on
public life. "In our view," they write, "participatory-deliberative
arrangements \[created by officials\] represent the most promising path
toward the ends of deliberative democracy" (Cohen and Fung, 2004: 30).
We certainly favor "participatory-deliberative arrangements" situated in
public institutions and organized by public officials. But we also hold
that deliberation will continue to fall short if it is not also situated
and controlled, to a very significant degree, in civil society as well.
In this light, public deliberation is just as much about strengthening
civil society and civic practices as it is about adjusting how public
officials do their work. Essentially, we see two problems with viewing
officially sanctioned and organized deliberation (important as it is) as
the sole, or even the primary, path toward more meaningful deliberative
democratic practice. First, instances of empowered participatory
governance, let alone well-designed instances (beyond the debilitating
democratic kabuki of most formal, public hearings) are quite rare.
Therefore, deliberation must now act from outside official institutions
much of the time or there will be so few opportunities that its proof of
concept and transformative potential may never adequately be realized.
Moreover, [deliberation must always be anchored and controlled from
outside officialdom to]{.underline} some extent if it is to [address
issues---and solutions to issues]{.underline}---[that]{.underline} are
controversial and [threaten to significantly upset the status
quo]{.underline}. [Officially sanctioned]{.underline} and organized
**[deliberation will naturally tend to be limited to those issues and
solutions with which officials are comfortable]{.underline}**. And
should issues and solutions uncomfortable to officials make their way
onto the policy agenda through the efforts of enterprising citizens,
officially controlled deliberation is likely to be conducted in a less
than whole-hearted fashion. **[Thus, relying solely on
institutionally-based solutions to the problem of power invites the very
distortions and dangers of agenda setting, exclusion, constraining rules
of engagement and the like]{.underline}** that Young and Sanders warn
about. In short, if one way to connect public deliberation to processes
of political and societal change is to make official institutional
practices more inclusive of public deliberation, another is through
citizens, groups and coalitions learning to leverage deliberation on
behalf of democratic change from the position of civil society. Our
capacity to leverage deliberation for change depends in large part on
our ability to address the challenges of control and design at the
outset. By properly attending to control and design we tend to confer on
deliberative processes a high degree of procedural democratic legitimacy
which, in turn, creates a capacity to promote change. To date this
capacity has often gone untapped by deliberative democrats, who often
seem to feel as if their work is done when deliberations conclude and a
report is written. Rather, the conclusion of a round of deliberation
marks not the end of the deliberative democrat's work, but a new and
most challenging phase of it, an activist phase of a particular kind. In
conceptualizing such deliberative activism, Young's juxtaposition of the
deliberative democrat and the political activist is a useful point of
departure. In her "Activist Challenges to Deliberative Democracy," Young
suggests that, "\[T\]he theory of deliberative democracy should be
critical of typical tactics of activism such as street marches,
boycotts, or sit-ins, on the grounds that their activities confront
rather than engage in discussion with people the movement's members
disagree with." The activist, on the other hand, believes that
"[deliberation is as likely to reinforce injustice as to undermine it"
because existing power arrangements "make it nearly impossible for the
structurally disadvantaged to propose solutions to social problems that
might alter the structural positions in which they stand]{.underline}."
Such structural change, in contrast to cosmetic policy adjustments that
only skim the surface of societal inequities, can best be addressed, in
Young's view, via activism.

### 2NC -- AT: Deliberative Democracy - Empiricism

#### [Empirical research]{.underline} proves inequality controls the structure of deliberative democracy -- racial divides fuel subordinate status in nearly all deliberations

**Mendelberg & Oleske 2k** (Tali Mendelberg, professor in the Department
of Politics, at Princeton University, John Oleske, Political Scientist,
"Race and Public Deliberation", Political Communication, 17:169 --191,

Some theorists have recently articulated the need to build more bridges
between delib- erative theory and political reality (e.g., Gutmann &
Thompson, 1996). [Our empirical study]{.underline}, although it is a
first, tentative step, [suggests that meaningful deliberation among
citizens is hampered]{.underline} by the difficulty of fully
implementing the rules that ideal deliberation requires. Entman and
Rojecki put the problem well: "The more social capital, the more
trustful communication among diverse members in a society and the better
able it is to work out its problems. . . . \[[Yet\] the racial divide
embodies the single most serious instance in the U.S. of low social
capital across groups"]{.underline} (1996, pp. 1--2). **[Subordinate
groups cannot rely on deliberation to secure equality and build a
community with dominant groups, because deliberation must have equality
and community as preconditions to succeed]{.underline}**. The situation
is a closed circle: One cannot get what one needs when the process of
obtaining it is itself tainted by the lack of what one needs. Theorists
who tackle inequality at length tend to focus on the twin facts that
do[minant groups silence speakers from subordinate groups and that
subordinate speakers do not feel empowered to speak]{.underline}
(Mansbridge, 1983; Sanders, 1997; Young, 1996). [How- ever, these
analyses leave out the other problem with inequality: the very
unwillingness of dominant groups to enlarge their community to include
subordinate groups in the first place]{.underline}. Furthermore, the
meaning of language was contested, making the deliberation itself an
issue. On our reading, [the anger and frustration of minority
citizens]{.underline} and their integrated White allies w[as a
product]{.underline} not so much of feeling silenced but **[of
accurately perceiving that, in the guise of principled, rational speech,
they and their children were being set apart in an isolated community
and marked as inferior citizens]{.underline}**. The question remains as
to how to get dominant groups to listen to subordinate groups. How do
subordinate groups get dominant groups to the table at all?

### 2NC -- AT: Deliberative Democracy - Proceduralism

#### Even under the most st[ringently procedural]{.underline} rules of deliberative democracy, racism [strongly]{.underline} advantages majority groups

of Politics, at Princeton University, John Oleske, Political Scientist,

The rhetoric at these meetings was not the ideal deliberation envisioned
by many deliberative theorists.13 Some theorists might object that the
meetings failed to provide an adequate opportunity to deliberate. We
consider this problem subsequently, but for now, we note that [the
meetings did go a long way toward meeting the most basic procedural
rules of deliberation]{.underline}: They were public, they entailed a
collective discussion, there was a relatively equal opportunity to
participate in all phases, and decisions were driven by arguments rather
than power. Thus, the meetings were a rare opportunity for citizens to
publicly and formally discuss a crucial matter of public policy. [We use
the substantive criteria of ideal deliberation to analyze how and why
the rhetoric was problematic]{.underline}. The deliberation we studied
was deficient in the following ways: (a) The segregated meeting ended in
consensus, which is a desirable outcome for some theorists, but it did
so through rhetoric that allowed participants to legitimize their
opposition to integration; (b) the integrated meeting did not lessen
conflict, because the implicitly racial rhetoric used by segregated
Whites was decoded as racial and racist, and the meeting was not
conducive to discussing ways of reducing that racism; (c) segregated
Whites did not use less group-inter ested language, or make more
references to the good of both commu- nities, or show signs of greater
tolerance at the integrated meeting, since in their inter- pretation
their rhetoric already was legitimate; (d) integrated citizens at the
integrated meeting did not express mutual understanding, because what
they decoded made them too angry and defensive; and (e) [facts and
reasoning played an important role, but in a highly selective,
self-serving way]{.underline} not endorsed by deliberative theorists.
What was perceived in Leonia as nonracial and well reasoned was
perceived in Englewood as racial and poorly reasoned. [What allowed
speakers to respect each other as civic-minded community members in
Leonia became a marker of group interest and opposition to a broader
community in Englewood]{.underline}. What counted as [universal language
for one community counted as the opposite in the other.]{.underline} In
short, [the positive effects of deliberation rest on the ability of the
opposing sides to communicate about their disagreement]{.underline}.
**[When the meaning of speech is contested, deliberation is unlikely to
be reasoned or consensual]{.underline}** (see also Warren, 1992, p.
15).14 The two expectations we derived from Mansbridge's work each found
support here, although each is complicated by racially coded language.
First, Leonia's segregated meeting, with its common interests, ended in
a sense of equal respect and consensus. However, it did so as a racially
segregated community, because it was a racially segregated commu- nity.
The White citizens at Leonia's segregated meeting engaged in what
Mansbridge calls the "enclave model of democratic deliberation" (1996,
p. 58). But ironically, Mansbridge recommends this model as a way for
subordinate groups to articulate their collective interests in a safe
setting, to understand themselves better, forge bonds of solidarity, and
hammer out conceptions of self, community, justice, and universality.
These meetings allowed the privileged group to do this, and do it
effectively. Faced with concerted opposition to regionalization, the
state abandoned regionalization and opted for segregated Whites'
preferred solution: It proposed that Englewood "work to correct the im-
balance itself." Englewood must now create a special magnet school, with
technical aid but no funds from the state. The second expectation we
derived from Mansbridge's work---that the adversarial meeting in
Englewood would end in alienation---was fulfilled. But this was in part
due to the contested meaning of language. Englewood residents seemed
angry not only about what they perceived as racism from the other side,
but at what they saw as an attempt to hide racism behind a veil of
legitimate words. The conflicting interests would have been more easily
resolved if the issue had not also included a conflict over basic
respect. At issue at these meetings was the affront to human dignity, an
affront that one group perceived and the other group denied. The
problems at these meetings are likely to arise outside the realm of race
as well. **[Racism undermines deliberation because it produces strong
negative assumptions about the opposing deliberators.]{.underline}**
[The same is probably true of sexism, nationalism, and other sets of
ideas that denigrate an out-group.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Law Key

#### Celia v. Missouri proves the law doesn't apply when it comes to people of color

**Brown 17 -** (DeNeen L. Brown, local enterprise reporter, "Missouri v.
Celia, a Slave: She killed the white master raping her, then claimed
self-defense", 10-19-17)

She warned the white slave owner that the rapes had to stop. Celia, 19,
had endured five years of assaults by Robert Newsom, the Missouri
[widower](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/19/missouri-v-celia-a-slave-she-killed-the-white-master-raping-her-then-claimed-self-defense/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b01687de07be)
in his 70s who'd purchased her when she was 14. She'd borne two of her
predator's children. Now [she was being courted by an enslaved black man
named George. When she became pregnant a third time, George told her the
farmer's abuse could not continue. Celia warned Newsom that she would
hurt him if he came to her cabin again. She also asked his two adult
daughters for help keeping their father away. But on the night of June
23, 1855, Newsom crept into her cabin and tried to force her to have sex
with him. Celia took a stick and bashed his head with it, killing him,
according to court documents. Then she pushed his body into a roaring
fire in her cabin's fireplace. The next day, his bones were carried out
in the embers. What followed was her arrest and a groundbreaking legal
case known as the State of Missouri vs. Celia, a Slave --- a dispute
that played out long before #MeToo hashtags on Twitter and the explosive
sexual assault and harassment allegations against]{.underline} [Harvey
Weinstein](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/violence-threats-begging-harvey-weinsteins-30-year-pattern-of-abuse-in-hollywood/2017/10/14/2638b1fc-aeab-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.9d08e24a4e9d),
Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, Bill Cosby and other powerful men. *\[[She

[In Missouri in 1855, it was a crime "to take any woman unlawfully
against her will and by force, menace or duress, compel her to be
defiled," allowing women to argue self-defense in resisting such
assaults. Did that law apply to enslaved women? Celia's court-appointed
defense lawyer argued that it did. He asked Circuit Court Judge William
Hall to instruct the jury that a slave master had no right to rape a
slave and that the slaying could be considered justifiable. But the
judge refused to give the jury those instructions. Instead, Hall told
the 12 white men weighing the evidence: "If Newsom was in the habit of
having intercourse with the defendant who was his slave and went to her
cabin on the night he was killed to have intercourse with her or for any
other purpose and while he was standing in the floor talking to her she
struck him with a stick which was a dangerous weapon and knocked him
down, and struck him again after he fell, and killed him by either blow,
it is murder in the first degree." Though Celia had pleaded not guilty,
she'd confessed to the crime, according to Jefferson Jones, who
investigated the killing.]{.underline} Jones had interrogated Celia in
jail about a week after she was arrested to learn if there were any
accomplices in Newsom's slaying. "I asked her whether she thought she
would hang for what she had done," Jones testified, according to court
documents. "She said she thought she would hang. I then told her to tell
the whole truth." Celia told Jones the farmer had been abusing her for
years and "he had told her he was coming down to her cabin that night.
She told him not to come, that if he came she would hurt him." "I asked
her if George had asked her to kill the old man; said he never had. Said
that George had told her that he would have nothing to do with her if
she did not quit the old man." She told Jones that after she killed
Newsom, his body lay about an hour on the floor, before she decided to
burn it, he testified. [Christopher Gordon]{.underline}, director of
library and collections at the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis,
[called the trial "a sham. Most everyone on the jury was either
pro-slavery or they owned]{.underline}
[slaves](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/19/missouri-v-celia-a-slave-she-killed-the-white-master-raping-her-then-claimed-self-defense/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b01687de07be)[themselves.
The thought of a slave --- and let alone a female slave --- getting away
with something like this was not anything they would
permit.]{.underline} The defense tried very hard to play on sympathy and
cast Robert Newsom as a predator. ... But the racial politics of the day
won out." *\[[Hunting down runaway slaves: The cruel ads of Andrew
Jackson and 'the master

At the time, the country was edging toward civil war over slavery, and
Missouri was a microcosm of those tensions. [White people who supported
slavery wanted Celia executed for the murder of her master. But others
expressed sympathy for her,]{.underline} wrote Melton A. McLaurin,
author of the book, "Celia: A Slave." "Although slave law had come in
the course of the 19th century to recognize a slave's right to use force
to protect her life, it had not extended this right to include
protection against sexual assault," McLaurin wrote. On Nov. 1, 1855, the
Glasgow Weekly Times reported that Celia had been found guilty in
Callaway County [Circuit
Court](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/19/missouri-v-celia-a-slave-she-killed-the-white-master-raping-her-then-claimed-self-defense/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0bd9574e19f8)
"of murder in the first degree ... for the murder of her master." The
jury sentenced her to death, though her case was appealed to the
Missouri Supreme Court. While awaiting her execution, Celia escaped.
"The negro woman 'Celia' confined in the Calloway jail, and under
sentence of death, made her escape a few days before she was to have
been executed, and was at large last accounts," the Glasgow, Mo.,
newspaper reported on Nov. 22, 1855. "She was to have been hung last
Friday." [Celia was captured a few days later. The state Supreme Court
refused to overturn Celia's conviction. But her execution was delayed
long enough to allow her to give birth to her third child. The baby was
stillborn. On Dec. 21, 1855, Celia was taken to the Calloway Courthouse
in Fulton, Mo., and "hanged until she died."]{.underline}

#### The United States Supreme Court Unlawful Ruling for the Scottsboro Cases

**Social Service Review 18** -- (Social Service Review, "The United
States Supreme Court and the Scottsboro Cases", The University of
Chicago Press, Page 336-337
https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30010470.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A2908c0db0ef8b747d01fb060259910cf)

The case of one of the defendants, Clarence Norris, has again gone by an
analogous route to the Supreme Court. Norris was brought to trial in
November, 1933, and [a motion was made on his behalf to quash the
indictment on the grounds of exclusion of Negroes from juries in Jackson
County, where the indictment was found. The motion was denied. The
defendant was again found guilty. The verdict was again sustained by the
Supreme Court of the State]{.underline}, and has again (April I, 1935)
been passed on by the Supreme Court of the United States.2 This time Mr.
Chief Justice Hughes delivers the opinion, and this time the judgment is
again reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings. This
time the emphasis is however, being laid upon the fact that, although it
is shown that there are in Alabama competent Negroes, capable of serving
upon grand and petit juries, they have been consistently excluded from
such service. [The argument in this case, which is devoted to a
considerable extent to the question of whether or not there is evidence
of the presence in Alabama of Negroes qualified to serve, is less
interesting in some respects than the arguments in the earlier opinion,
but it is, of course, a more distressing evidence of the consistent
influence of racial prejudice seventy years after the close of the war
in which the South submitted the issue of slavery to the arbitrament of
war.]{.underline} There was no dissenting opinion in this case, but Mr.
Justice McReynolds did not hear the evidence. These decisions recall the
so-called Arkansas cases,3 in which, in 1923, the Supreme Court took
notice of the hideous travesty on justice perpetrated by the Arkansas
courts when a group of Negro share-croppers were trying to find some
protection against their [exploiters and were the victims of violent
attack and then suffered in the denial of every item in the bill of
rights.]{.underline} In the case of these defendants under the guidance
of Mr. Moorfield Storey, the Court found itself able to distinguish the
situation from that of Leo Frank, 4 a Jew who was the victim of the mob
spirit in Atlanta, in which it had not seemed possible for the Supreme
Court to assume jurisdiction. In the Arkansas cases, Justice Holmes, who
had dissented in the Frank case, wrote the opinion. Then Justice
Sutherland, who wrote the opinion of the Court in the first Scottsboro
case, dissented with Justice McReynolds, who dissented in the first
Scottsboro case.

#### Dred Scott Teaches How to Resist Bad Supreme Court Rulings

**Jones 18** -- (Martha Jones, "How to resist bad Supreme Court
rulings", The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/07/06/how-to-resist-bad-supreme-court-rulings/?utm_term=.f3dff16ea2da)

When the Supreme Court last week upheld the Trump administration's
travel ban, [opponents expressed their horror through analogy: comparing
the decision to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the infamous 1857 decision that
held that people of African descent, because of their color, were
categorically ineligible for U.S. citizenship.]{.underline} "Move over,
Dred Scott," read a June 26
[headline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/move-over-dred-scott/2018/06/26/6f8f425c-796d-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html?utm_term=.cec91eea9b19)
at The Washington Post, where the legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, David D. Cole, made the case that the travel-ban
ruling, like [the Dred Scott decision, is "likely to be judged by
history as one of the court's greatest failures."]{.underline} The
comparison of Trump v. Hawaii to Dred Scott hinges on the argument that
the two cases are similarly egregious, turning on specious ideas about
racial difference: [then against black people and now against Muslim
people]{.underline}. That's true, and certainly a reason we should study
Dred Scott in this moment. But which lessons we draw from the past
matters. [The Dred Scott decision was a bad one, and yet it also exposed
the limitations of the court's power]{.underline} --- and how lawyers
and activists curbed its influence. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney
overreached when he aimed to seal the fate of black Americans, and the
resistance to his ruling is instructive for those who are seeking to do
the same in the face of Trump v. Hawaii. No sooner had the Dred Scott
decision been handed down than it was under attack from many sides.
African American activists and members of the abolitionist movement
immediately opposed what was a blow to those who had long claimed that
former slaves were free people and also citizens. At stake was whether
the United States was destined to be a white man's country or whether
there was a future for an interracial democracy on the horizon. Taney's
fellow jurists also objected to the blanket exclusion of black Americans
from the body politic. Lower federal courts resisted in surprisingly
effective ways. Their willingness to interpret Taney's decision narrowly
and treat black litigants like citizens was a blow that sapped Dred
Scott of much real influence. Sitting on the federal circuit court for
Illinois, Justice John McLean --- who also sat on the U.S. Supreme Court
and penned a dissent in Dred Scott --- reined in the ruling in Mitchell
v. Lamarjust a few months after Dred Scott was decided. McLean deemed
Joseph Mitchell, a free African American from Illinois, a citizen,
thwarting Taney's attempt to render all black Americans people without
rights under the Constitution. Because Mitchell was descended from free
people, rather than slaves, his status before the Constitution differed
from that of Scott. [State courts also resisted Dred Scott.]{.underline}
In Ohio, one court confronted the question of black citizenship when
called upon to interpret the phrase "citizen of the United States" as
set forth in its state constitution. [Determining that Taney's opinion
applied only to those who, like Scott, were descendants of slaves, the
court decided that a free man of mixed racial descent could be
considered a citizen.]{.underline} In Maine, by request of the
legislature, the state's high court interpreted a key provision of the
state constitution in a way that similarly narrowed Dred Scott. The
question was whether free men of color could serve as electors under a
provision limiting that role to "male citizens of the United States.
Yes, the court concluded: "Our constitution does not discriminate
between the different races of people which constitute the inhabitants
of our state; but that the term, 'citizens of the United States,' as
used in that instrument, applies as well to free colored persons of
African descent." Even in Taney's home state of Maryland, where he was
generally admired, the state's highest court refused to adopt the logic
of Dred Scott. When asked in the 1858 case of Hughes v. Jackson whether
a free man of color could bring suit in a state court, the answer was a
clear yes. Taney might have barred black litigants from federal courts
as noncitizens, but the Maryland court determined that his approach was
not consistent with the state's interests. There, it was deemed
essential that free black men and women have the ability to protect
their property and persons by way of court proceedings --- that, contra
Taney, they did indeed have rights that white men were bound to respect.
By the fall of 1858, Taney was despondent over the criticisms of his
ruling. "I do not feel willing to write a defense of one of my judicial
opinions," he wrote to his son-in-law and confidant J. Mason Campbell.
Yet he very much wanted to. Taney's need to justify his ruling reflects
the degree to which Dred Scott was widely reviled. [A sense of judicial
propriety kept him from speaking out publicly, but his personal writings
reveal the depth of his disappointment. Taney lamented how "disingenuous
perversion and misrepresentation" were shaping the fate of Dred
Scott.]{.underline} So he privately penned a supplemental opinion to
Dred Scott, one he hoped to publish "while the question is still
exciting attention." As he had in Dred Scott, Taney's supplement drew
upon historical analysis to argue that people of African descent had
enjoyed no rights from 1689, as British subjects, through 1787, when the
Constitution was ratified. And he stood ready to reargue the issue,
though he suspected that the supplement's publication would take place
only after his death: "My executors must in some form or other bring it
before the public." That is indeed what would happen. Dred Scott was
good law for the briefest time, and even then was never given the full
force in the daily lives of black Americans that Taney intended.
Ultimately, it took the Civil War to resolve the controversy over black
citizenship that Dred Scott had ignited. A consensus emerged in which
black Americans were deemed citizens by virtue of their birth on U.S.
soil, first in an 1862 opinion by Attorney General Edward Bates, then in
the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and, finally, with the ratification of the
14th Amendment to the Constitution in July 1868. Dred Scott was undone.
Invoking Dred Scott today should do more than provide an example of how
courts have, from time to time, made bad decisions. It should also show
how these bad decisions can be undermined, undercut, resisted and,
ultimately, even overturned. We should remember Dred Scott as an example
of how high courts can err, but it is most valuable as a primer on what
can follow in the wake of a court's injustice and as a cautionary tale
about what might await a nation that fails to respond to it.

## 2AC -- Shell -- Plan Affirmatives

#### Our interpretation is that the affirmative should be able to weigh the advantages of the plan enacted by the federal government, the negative has the right to the status quo and a competitive policy option. 

#### Violation -- Their interpretation of debate moots the 1ac while steering the conversation away from the resolutional question. 

C.  **Vote Neg -**

#### Plan Focus - our framework ensures a stable locus for links and the comparison of alternatives. Alternative frameworks which do not ensure that the plan is the starting-point of the debate make confusion and judge intervention inevitable.

#### Ground -- there are an infinite number of unpredictable K frameworks, K links, and K impacts. Forcing the aff to debate in the neg framework moots the 1AC. Because the K could literally be about anything, their so-called framework destroys aff ground because we can never predict what we'll have to compare our plan to. Even if there's some ground for us to respond to their arg, it's not good or predictable and losing the 1AC puts us at an inherent disadvantage. 

#### Topic Specific Education - Only debates about the plan translate into education about the topic. There would be no reason to switch topics every year if not for plan-focus debate. K frameworks encourage ultra-generics like the 'state bad' K that are stale and uneducational

### 2AC - Student Activism

#### Student activism about arm sales is key to empowerment and change.

Schools are experiencing a tidal wave of student activism in response to
the shooting in Parkland, Florida. Practically overnight, Marjory
Stoneman Douglas [High School students have become the new face of gun
control and school safety --- challenging lawmakers, tweeting out their
views, and organizing marches, boycotts, and walkouts for stricter gun
laws]{.underline}. As young people across the country join in, it's an
inspiring moment for their educators --- and a tricky one. [Many feel
powerless against state and federal laws, uncertain as to what their
district leaders will endorse, unsure how to steer anger into action, or
overwhelmed by a torrent of youthful voices.]{.underline} We spoke with
[Gretchen Brion-Meisels](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/node/125602), an
expert in youth development who studies ways to build a positive school
climate. Here, she shares perspectives on how teachers and
administrators can acknowledge their students\' concerns and empower
their insightful leadership. Why [it's important to take students' views
seriously]{.underline}: From a social-emotional standpoint[: In terms of
building trust, relationships, and a positive school culture, it's vital
that everyone in a school building ---teachers, staff, and students ---
feel like their voices are respected and heard. Part of ensuring this is
making sure that there is a clear path for giving and receiving
feedback]{.underline}. Students must feel safe and welcome in school, in
order to be able to fully engage with their learning. From a youth
empowerment standpoint: We know from [research on youth participatory
action](http://yparhub.berkeley.edu/) and youth organizing that [when
young people are given a voice in shaping the policies and practices in
their school, there are benefits for both the young people and the
school. The young people benefit from learning the skills and tools
necessary to research and articulate their arguments, and from the sense
of agency that comes with being an authentic partner in decision-making
processes. Schools benefit because they better understand the ways in
which their policies and practices are impacting their students, and
because partnering with students builds trust and authentic
collaboration.]{.underline} From a policy standpoint: [Too often
policies about schools are made without consulting or considering the
young people and adults in schools.]{.underline} There are countless
examples of teachers and students across history protesting the
decisions of policymakers and/or demanding policy reforms that more
fully acknowledge their humanity. [Young people across the country have
recently advocated against the criminalization of youth in schools,
tracking, and punitive discipline policies; and in favor of gun control,
LGBTQ rights, and a National Bill of Student Rights]{.underline}. In
early February, youth across the country took part in a national [Black
Lives Matter Week of Action in Our
Schools](https://www.facebook.com/The-National-Black-Lives-Matter-Week-of-Action-in-Our-Schools-192373061312325/),
where they demanded an end to zero tolerance and the implementation of
restorative justice practices; the hiring of more black teachers; and a
mandate for black history/ethnic studies in K-12 schools. The incredible
young people who are leading the fight in Parkland are building on a
deep history of youth activism in this country. How schools can welcome

## 2AC -- Shell -- Non-Traditional Affirmative/Black Framework

#### The affirmative recognizes debate as a cite for activism. The 1nc does not address the purpose of the debate established by the 1ac \<insert analysis from critical solvency cards in 1ac\>

#### We will win that their proposed model of plan-focused debate is bad:

### 2AC - 1. Unlimiting

#### A. Makes it impossible to be negative -- we would have access to any and every action by the USFG multiplied by fiat which explodes the negative research burden which turns their interpretation.

#### B. Makes it impossible to be affirmative -- crushes our potential to use our experiences to relate to the topic. We would have to rewrite our experiences to cater to the topic and not our needs which literally makes debate impossible because it does not address our everyday needs

### 2AC - 2. Anti-educational

#### A. Conditionality -- it allows it and encourages it. Condo is a voting issue because it encourages argumentative irresponsibility, kitchen sink strategies, and multiple contradictory arguments and destroys affirmatives competitive equities. 

#### B. Plan Inclusive counterplans -- plan focus guarantees PICs. PICs are a voting issue because they steal aff ground and for the aff to debate itself, encourages vague plan writing which destroys negs ground and result in trivial distinctions between the plan and the counterplan like a penny saved is a penny earned. You cannot PIC out of an embodied performance.

#### C. Process CPs -- Neg's interpretation allows it because they focus on the process of implementation. Process PICs are a voting issue because they destroy topic specific education, they destroy the aff because they include the affirmative, and lastly, they are limitless and unpredictable. If you hate conditions, consult, and dirty word PICs - vote for us!

### 2AC - 3. \<insert aff specific state-based offense\>

#### Activism is a better approach to debate -

#### We need not learn how to act later but engage in action now. We can experience material outcome of our actions today which will help us know how to engage in activism more effectively later, but solves our argument about the necessity of action today \<insert aff uniqueness\>

#### Their interpretation would encroach on those skills by devaluing the knowledge that students bring to the activity and the perspective they bring about what should be done now. Perspectivism is net-benefit to our method because it encourages students to relate to the topic via their experience. 

#### \<insert Gerhke or perm-like card here\>\*this is also a permutation because it says K and policy can go hand in hand, but K has to come first\*

## 2AC - Permutations

### 2AC - Perm -- Performance + Law 

#### Perm do both. Critical analysis is necessary in order for debate to function. Traditional policy and critical debate requires the same advocacy and research skills behind the actions proposed, they go hand and hand.

Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy Analysis: Policy
Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary Argumentation
and Debate, 19, 18-39./cdc

Most debate theorists who oppose critique arguments advance a
rationalist paradigm of policy evaluation. In their minds, a strict
cost-benefit analysis, particularly a quantitative analysis based on the
preservation of human life, is the only means by which an advocate can
justifY or dejustifY a policy. In his criticism of scientific models of
public policy, Robert Formaini, the former vice president for public
policy at the Cato Institute, explains the rationalist policy paradigm:
According to the policy rationalist, if the risks are \"acceptable\" and
the \"benefits\" are greater than \"costs,\" what person can argue that
the proposed policy ought not be done, and on what inductive basis? It
will not work to say that the proposed policy is \"wrong,\" \"immoral,\"
\"unjust,\" and a \"waste of time and effort.\" These arguments are
\"unscientific\" and \"value-laden\" with the citizen\'s personal,
irrational prejudices. (69) [In policy debate, the rationalist
perspective marginalizes critiques by mistakenly representing a
particular approach to policy evaluation as the essential means of
policy deliberation, implying that one theoretical perspective is both
appropriate for all policy questions and preferable to all other means
of policy comparison]{.underline}. Marouf Hasian and Edward Panetta
argue that \"both the promise and the peril of the critique come from
its use as a method of questioning some of the assumptions behind
\'policy\' debate itself\' (47). They continue, \"the use of \'the
critique\' in policy debate means a virtual abandonment of many of the
cherished assumptions of policy decision making\" (53). If by [policy
debate and policy decision making,]{.underline} Hasian and Panetta [are
referring only to the conventional practices of academic debate, they
would be]{.underline} [correct]{.underline}. However, their criticism is
not that critiques simply challenge academic policy debate as we
commonly practice it, but rather that critiques are \"politically
irrelevant and counterproductive\" (54). This conclusion is arrived at
by giving primacy to rationalist policy models, including claims such as
that \"[debating is an inherently rationalistic activity]{.underline}\"
(54). Faith in rationalism as the core element of policy debate leads
Derek Jinks to posit that if critiques have any theoretical legitimacy,
\"they should take the form of disadvantages, counterplans, solvency
arguments, etc.\" (AI4). links argues that resolutions imply the context
for academic debates, and since contemporary resolutions are interpreted
as policy questions, they should be addressed from a policy perspective
(AI2). While this line of reasoning may bear some merit, Jinks begs the
question of whether the rationalist model is the only possible policy
perspective. Jinks relies on a rationalist cost-benefit analysis model
for decision making. He argues that [policy decisions cannot be made
without comparing unique costs and benefits of proposed courses of
action]{.underline} (A 14). Jinks likewise contends that [policy
debate]{.underline} should [begin from a set of shared assumptions about
the values at stake]{.underline}, which should simply be taken as true
(Al3). Matthew Shors and Steve Mancuso propose an extreme division
between critiques and policy discourse. Shorsand Mancuso make the same
error as Jinks · by generalizing from rationalist policy models to all
policy deliberation. They claim that critiques are \"utterly
irrelevant\" and that critiques ask us to believe that \"it is pointless
to discuss policies\" (A16). Shors and Mancuso would have us believe
that critiques \"ignore policy issues altogether\" (A16). It is because
critiques do not argue unique commensurable costs or benefits that they
contend that critiques carry \"little, if any, weight in policy
comparison\" (AI6). Only by failing to recognize the broad diversity of
policy perspectives can Shors and Mancuso come to conclude that \"the
Critique is wholly incompatible with, and non-germane to, policy
debate\" (A 17). Perhaps the most vehement opponent of critiques has
been Solt. Solt makes many of the same assumptions about policy analysis
as do Jinks, Shors, and Mancuso. Solt so strongly believes that
critiques challenge the assumption that \"what we are essentially
engaged in is a policy debate\" that he recommends the first response to
critiques be to reestablish the policy framework (\"Demystifying\" A9).
For Solt, \"the kl\'itik is a non-policy argument\" (Anti-hitik ii). He
sees debate as a policy forum, and critiques are considered not to be
\"germane to the subject at hand\" (Anli-Kl\'itik xxii). Solt argues
that \"at root, the kritik misunderstands the nature of the policy
calculus\" (Anti-Kritik x:xiii). Solt\'s rationalist assumptions are
apparent in arguments encouraging us to \"take an a priori ethical and
political framework for granted\" (\"De mystifying\" A II). Similarly,
he ignores a whole body of interpretive and communicative policy
analysis literature when he claims that \"ideas are more important than
the rhetoric with which they are expressed\" (\"Demystifying\" All).
Here, Solt is attempting to refute language critiques by retreating to a
separation of policies and the words that express, present, and form
those policies. For So It, the policy has a pure form outside of
language, and it is that form that is to be evaluated, rather than any
of the words that might malign it. Such a position is distant from much
of both contemporary communication studies and policy studies
literature. 24 CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE [The arguments
against critiques advanced by the policy debate rationalists
are]{.underline} suspect because they are [grounded in the traditions of
academic debate rather than contemporary theories of policy
studies.]{.underline} Consequently, [they dismiss questions they can not
force-fit into policy rationalism as neither worthwhile nor relevant to
policy discussions.]{.underline} As two policy analysts wrote of the
hegemony of the rationalist paradigm, \"When all you have is a hammer
the whole world looks like a nail\" (House and Shull 163-164). Berube
attacks critiques from a perspective not overtly founded on policy
rationalism, holding that critiques are fundamentally pre-fiat arguments
and that they disregard post-fiat substantive claims (\"Criticizing\"
68-72). Nonetheless, he bases his arguments upon [similar assumptions
about]{.underline} the [relationship between critiques and policy
debate. Here]{.underline}, \"fiat\" is a stand-in for \"policy focus,\"
in that fiat represents an enacted policy[. To claim that critiques
disregard issues that arise after fiat is to claim that they disregard
questions raised by enacting policies]{.underline}. Berube\'s argument
is also predicated upon the assumption that academic debate should
extend no further than \"intentional, intended, naIve, objective, and
rogate\" meanings (\"Criticizing\" 77). [This means that debaters and
critics should not question any of the assumptions or presuppositions of
texts or advocacies, uncritically accepting the premises inherent in
propositions.]{.underline} In the context of policy analysis, Berube \'s
standards require that policy advocates and analysts not ask of each
other: \"But what are your assumptions? Are they valid, or consistent,
or morally acceptable?\" This position is extraordinarily dangerous.
Wayne Booth argues that we must consider precisely those questions texts
attempt to foreclose: Each literary work implicates within itself a set
of norms about what questions are appropriate. Hemingway, to choose a
favorite example of the new feminist critics, does not demand of us that
we ask of his works, \"Is it good for men or women to accept
uncritically my machismo bravado?\" Indeed, he seems to work quite hard
to prevent our asking such a question. But surely, the feminist critics
say, and I think they are right, surely any teacher who teaches A
Farewell to Arms without inviting, somewhere along the line, a critical
consideration of Hemingway\'s heroes as human ideals, and of his
portraits of women as reflecting a peculiarly maimed creative vision,
and of his vision of the good life as a singularly immature one-surely
any such teacher is doing only half the job. (301) . . ; GEHRKE 25 .
Similarly, we might say that [any policy debater who does not seek a
critical consideration of the questions that a policy proposal tries to
foreclose is only doing half the job of a policy analyst]{.underline}.
Additionally, Berube assumes that we have pure and direct knowledge of
the meanings of a text. However, [in order to understand the meanings of
a text we must interpret that text. When advocates speak, we inevitably
interpret what they say. Meanings are found in the act of
interpretation, and those meanings differ, at least slightly, between
interpretations. There is virtually no text in a debate that can inspire
one universally agreed upon interpretation]{.underline}. As listeners
and readers, we can never find ourselves at a point where the
intentional, naive, and rogate meanings of a text are objectively
transparent to us. Determining what questions a text invites requires
interpreting the text, and these interpretations will vary, producing
contrary readings of what questions may be asked of that text. There is
no way to reconcile interpretations objectively. In order to evaluate
competing interpretations, one would have to engage in precisely the
critical textual analysis Berube attempts to foreclose. Since every
interaction with a text is interpretive, Berube\'s objective standard
for encountering a text never can be met. While opponents of critiques
might be expected to position critiques outside of policy discussion,
some advocates of critique arguments in debate have done the same. Many
· critique proponents advance either the position that we should not
consider ourselves policy analysts (Berube, \"Kritiks\" 21), or that
critiques supersede policy questions (Bahm 76; Broda-Bahm and Murphy
21). These arguments unwittingly lend assistance to opponents of
critiques by disconnecting critique arguments from policy discourse.
Stepping outside the policy focus is not inviting to those who hold
resolutely to a policy perspective; rationalist or otherwise. Rather, it
makes it all the more difficult to recognize the unique role critique
arguments can play in the enhancement of policy analysis and policy
debate. Broda-Bahm probably has done more to popularize language
critiques than any other theorist, but he clearly positions these
arguments outside of policy deliberation. BrodaBahm and Thomas Murphy
define a critique as \"any argument which does not provide an answer to
the resolutional question\" (21). In this context, they refer to \"the
resolutional question\" not merely as the resolution itself, but as the
affirmative case which advocates it (31 n3). They make the same
assumption often used as a premise against critiques, that we can and
should separate policies from the language that advances them.
Broda-Bahm separates policy and language by arguing that critiques do
not answer substantive advocacy, but rather focus \"more directly on the
actual language practices of an opponent\" (Bahrn 69). This is
reinforced with attempts to give primacy to the \"more immediate and
more tangible\" effects of language by claiming policy proposals to be
fictions of debate rounds (Bahm 76). While positioning critiques outside
of policy discourse is a common error amongst critique advocates,
Shanahan is an exception. Much of Shanahan\'s essay is esoteric and
philosophical, but he does recognize at least a potential for critiques
to be a part of policy analysis. Making use of literature about
development assistance, Shanahan considers \"the possibility that the
kritik is policy debate\" (A8). Shanahan was nearest the mark when he
claimed that \"the kritik supplements, not supplants current debate
practice\" (A4). However, critique proponents have either ignored or
simply reiterated these claims, and opponents of critique argumentation
scoff at Shanahan\'s conception of policy analysis. Most likely, this is
because Shanahan\'s theory is so deeply embedded in Heidegger\'s
philosophy that it is difficult to read a policy focus beneath the
existential vocabulary. This may also be because neither proponents nor
opponents of critique argumentation have considered the policy studies
literature that reinforces the need for critiques in policy discussions.
[If one truly takes a policy perspective toward debate, one inevitably
finds that critique argumentation is a necessary element of policy
evaluation. The impasse hence arises because opponents of critiques hold
that the purpose of debate is to discuss policies exclusively, and
assume that policy rationalism is the only mechanism debaters can use to
do so]{.underline}. Many proponents of critiques maintain the impasse by
arguing that critiques somehow supersede or exist outside of policy
argumentation. The marginalization performed by both sides of this
controversy disconnects critique argumentation from politics, policy
deliberation, and real world debates. [To move past the impasse and
integrate critique argumentation and policy deliberation, we must
reposition critiques within the spectrum of policy
analysis.]{.underline}

#### Perm - narratives and law determine each other 

#### **Wharton '16**

**(Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller, Harvard
University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture and the
Humanities 1--11, pp. 8-11, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).**

Through a careful survey of legal history, Bricker demonstrates how
judicial reliance on precedent evolved from the twelfth through the
seventeenth centuries, from pre-modern canonical use of previous
decisions to illustrate important legal rules and concepts into modern
stare decisis in which previous rulings are binding precedent in
subsequent cases involving analogous factual scenarios. In order to
accomplish this transition, early modern jurists and **[legal theorists
had to "narrativize" the common law, transforming it from an arguably ad
hoc jumble of sometimes wildly inconsistent outcomes into a coherent
histoire of doctrinal cause and effect.]{.underline}** The result is a
narrative archetype that shapes all modern common law judicial
decisions: All of this is to suggest that, at the heart of the judicial
ruling, is a double act of storytelling and displacement. The courts
recite the facts of the case as a kind of omniscient historical
narrative, and then apply to those facts, logically and analogically, a
series of cases bearing similar legal principles. But [**both of these
acts of storytelling**, while gathering their force and legitimacy
through the appeal of narrative, **are also sublimated -- they only gain
their force,** the law claims, **through reason.**]{.underline} In
Bricker's analysis, what we often take for granted as a fundamental
rhetorical feature of the law becomes a historically constructed
narrative form or genre with a specific narrative function --
legitimation through application of previous judicial precedent. The
approaches to law and literature studies presented by Bricker and Waugh
Lagji comfortably work within both what Paul Heald has called the "law
as literature as language" and "law and literature as ethical discourse"
categories of law and literature scholarship.24 They combine study of
"the form of legal argument and the form of literary rhetoric," with
attention to whether "the lessons taught in fiction have direct
applicability to how substantive legal decisions should be made."25 In
doing so, however, they take important strides beyond critical
methodology and vocabulary that depend upon analogy and equivalence, a
type of criticism that never quite captures law and literature's shared
identity within and as narrative. To the extent that **[law and
literature are narrative, they participate in the same project. They are
two sides of the same coin, the currency with which historical
continuity and socio-political cohesion are purchased.]{.underline}**
If, as Heald suggested in 2009, "Law and Literature" as a field of
academic study continues in mattering little to the law, legal
scholarship will continue to account inadequately for how gendered,
racist, ableist, and classist constructions of human subjectivity lead
to and perpetuate structural inequality within legal systems.26 And
**[legal education]{.underline}**, especially in the United States,
**[will continue to produce scholars and practitioners blind to the
extra-judicial or extra-legislative content that "pours in" to the law
via literary and other narrative forms of cultural
production.]{.underline}**27 We are particularly interested in
reasserting the stakes of law and narrative as defined by Peters**[. Law
and narrative battles the layman's misconception or rhetorically
constructed notion that the law always represents the
"real."]{.underline}**28 In **[fact legal narrative sometimes quite
openly operates as fiction, and explicitly demands a willing suspension
of disbelief in the reader's mind. At other moments, though, legal
narrative can venture unintentionally into fictional
speculation.]{.underline}** As Best shows, **[a tendency to accept
without examination legally significant, yet extra-legal interpretations
of disputed concepts and forms can lead to implicit bias that is all the
more difficult to eradicate because the hermeneutic and rhetorical
operations of legal discourse obscure its presence.]{.underline}**29 At
the same time, however, **[by insisting the law is ideally a closed
system that works most perfectly when it no longer needs to refer beyond
itself]{.underline}**, some legal scholars and judicial **[authorities
create legal arguments that unmoor the law from any grounding in the
real, lived experience of the individuals it governs]{.underline}**.
Such is the case with Justice Clarence Thomas's recent pronouncement in
Obergefell v. Hodges that "\[s\]laves did not lose their dignity (any
more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them
to be enslaved."30 This bit of sophistry is not even clearly true in an
abstract legal sense given that one could hardly be said to own or
possess a thing when those rights are neither universally acknowledged
in the collective social imagination nor enforceable in a court of law.
Of what personal or even symbolic value are one's dignity and humanity
when one can legally be bought, sold, raped, killed, or tortured by
one's legal owners? To accept Thomas's reasoning on this point, even if
it were logical from a purely legal standpoint, requires one to ignore
the terrible reality of slavery. Further, judicial arguments over the
extent to which the interpretation of legal precedent should refer
beyond the four corners of a document might be read, in part, as
aesthetic disputes over how much fiction is too much in a legal
narrative. Responding to the majority's central holding in Citizens
United v. FEC that government speech regulation cannot discriminate on
the basis of a speaker's corporate identity, Justice John Paul Stevens
writes on behalf of the dissenters, "[The fact that corporations are
different from human beings might seem to need no elaboration, except
that the majority opinion almost completely elides it."]{.underline}31
Stevens certainly criticizes the majority's interpretation of the law,
but he describes in great detail and seems even more concerned by the
majority's disregard for both history and contemporary reality. In
essence, he accuses the majority of adjudicating in a fantasy world: If
individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and
contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if
broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections
apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any);
and if legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect
virtue; then I suppose the majority's premise would be sound. In the
real world \[emphasis added\], we have seen, corporate domination of the
airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average listener's
exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens'
willingness and capacity to participate in the democratic process.32
Kennedy's majority opinion deals heavily in **[abstraction of both
"speech" and "personhood" and is replete with prolepses into future
scenarios where he imagines how an incorrect decision in the case at
hand may have disastrous results down the line.]{.underline}** Stevens,
by contrast, relies on analepsis as well as exhaustive citation to the
legal and historical record to justify his argument that his particular
interpretation of the law is the only just result for this particular
case. **[The two opinions not only offer two divergent legal outcomes,
they also exhibit very different narrative characteristics. These formal
distinctions are more than a matter of mere style,
however.]{.underline}** They substantively affect the kind of story each
justice is able to tell about the law, and reflect their implicit and
perhaps unexamined decisions [about the poetics of legal narrative --
that is their ideas about things such as what a legal narrative should
include, the order in which to tell it, whose perspective to foreground,
the sources from which to draw, the extent to which it can refer or
allude to other narratives and the substance of those
allusions]{.underline}, whether it follows the conventions of allegory
or historiography or something in between. In his essay "The Law Wishes
to Have a Formal Existence," Stanley Fish argues that ["the law is
continually creating and recreating itself out of the very materials and
forces it is obliged, by the very desire to be law, to push
away."]{.underline}33 As Fish describes it, **[the law's authority as
law stems in large part from the manner in which legal narrative
disavows]{.underline}**, through fancy rhetorical "legerdemain," its
origins in linguistic interpretation and situational morality.34 Law and
narrative has always meant more than this, as the papers on our panel
and those printed here make clear. There remains much work to do.
Acknowledging and exploring the complex interdependence between legal
and literary modes of cultural production might bring greater
transparency and flexibility to the legal process**[. Rather than
keeping up a false pretense that the law is a closed formal system, and
insisting it must be freed from contaminating outside influences, we
should spend more time examining how the law participates within a
larger narrative project.]{.underline}**35 The overview we offer here,
the essays by Bricker and Waugh Lagji, and the position statements
offered by the other participants in the original MLA roundtable, reveal
both how thoroughly narrative suffuses all legal practice and how much
work the narratives produced in and by the law do in the world. In
reasserting these suppressed but, we hope, unavoidable facts, we might
establish a more systematic and productive -- as opposed to obscure and
haphazard -- evolutionary relationship between law and other narrative
forms. Such an approach may empower petitioners and litigants by
providing a more complete picture of the discursive process from which
the law emerges and yet of which it remains only a part. It could also
foster greater mindfulness and clarity in legislative and judicial
decision-making by creating a broader awareness of how deeply legal
narratives draw upon and how profoundly they influence the creation of a
collective sociocultural identity

### 2AC -- Perm -- Democratic Participation

#### **Considering all forms of dissent is key to democracy** 

**Sparks 97,** Sparks, Holloway. "Dissident Citizenship: Democratic
Theory, Political Courage, and Activist Women." Hypatia, vol. 12, no. 4,
1997, pp. 74--110. JSTOR, JSTOR,
[www.jstor.org/stable/3810734](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3810734).

The participatory and deliberative views of citizenship as citizen
participation and joint deliberation and action offer provocative
visions of the possibilities for democratic societies in the late
twentieth century. Strikingly absent from this work, however, is
sustained attention to the role of dissent in democratic life.
[Theorists who do talk about dissent, furthermore, tend to raise the
issue only in terms of verbal deliberative dissent.]{.underline} For
example, Barber confines his discussion of dissent to his chapter on
democratic talk and judgment.' "A healthy democratic community," Barber
notes, will leave room for the expression of distrust, dissent, or just
plain opposition, even in lost causes where dissenters are very much in
the minority. Here the function of talk is to allow people to vent their
grievances or frustration or opposition, not in hopes of moving others
but in order to give public status to their strongly held personal
convictions. The cry "In spite of all, I believe , . ." is the hallmark
of such usage, and conscientious objection to military service is an
illuminating example. (Barber 1984,192) Dissenters can also register
continuing opposition even after a decision has been made. "I am part of
the community, I participated in the talk and deliberation leading to
the decision, and so I regard myself as bound; but let it be known that
I do not think we have made the right decision," says the dissenter in a
strong democracy. He means thus not to change the decision this time,
for it has been taken, but to bear witness to another point of view (and
thereby to keep the issue on the public agenda). (Barber 1984, 192)6 As
Barber's examples suggest, [dissent is not simply
resistance]{.underline} (e.g., Cooper 1995, chs. 2 and 7). [Dissenters
do not exit the political collective when they "lose" in a
discussion.]{.underline} [Neither do they simply change their minds, or
remain silent. Instead, to dissent is to maintain a principled
oppositional stance against a more powerful group while remaining
politically and publicly engaged]{.underline}. But the dissent that
Barber seems to have in mind here passes verbally between people who
remain participatory and deliberative equals, people who have equal
standing and membership within the strong democratic public. "I Holloway
Sparks 83 participated in the talk and deliberation leading to the
decision," says Barber's dissenter. Barber's dissenting actions are
undertaken by equals who are only temporarily ou\[t\]numbered during one
episode of public deliberation. But why limit dissent to interactions
within a decisionmaking community, between deliberative partners?
Barber's vision of citizenship and the minimal role reserved for dissent
would exclude from the realm of legitimate public action the important
activities undertaken by those citizens who are not in fact
participatory or deliberative equals. Barber and indeed most democratic
theorists pay no attention to actions that challenge the structure or
practices of political institutions, that highlight inequality and
exclusion within the collective, that assert independence on the part of
those citizens who are less powerful, that are intended to educate or
change the minds of the more powerful, or that challenge the boundaries
of the political itself[. By focusing almost exclusively on the debates
and deliberative interactions of those citizens on the "inside," most
democratic theorists have missed the important dissident activities of
those citizens on the "outside."]{.underline} [We clearly need to
consider these forms of dissident citizen action as central to an
adequate conception of democratic citizenship. To dissent, whether one
has an acknowledged place at the deliberative table or not, is to be an
engaged, active, self-govemed citizen. To dissent when one faces
domination and oppression, furthermore, marks a level of commitment to
participatory democracy rarely matched by nondissenting citizens.
Dissent has been a persistent, if sometimes vexing, visitor in the house
of democracy; perhaps it is time to unpack its bags, welcome it home,
and acknowledge its rightful place in our democratic lives.]{.underline}

In this essay, \[I\] have argued that [an adequate account of
citizenship should recognize both dissent and courage as crucial
elements of democratic life]{.underline}. In particular, [a theoretical
conception of dissident citizenship should attend to four dimensions of
dissent: oppositional, democratic, noninstitutionalized interactions
between unequal publics; discursive, performative, organizational, and
"everyday" dissenting actions]{.underline} within and among those
publics that augment or replace institutionalized forms of democratic
opposition; the material and institutional conditions that shape the
dissenting actions between unequal publics; and the ideas and discourses
that shape and influence dissidence, especially discourses about
democracy, citizenship, dissent, and courage. There are five broader
contributions of this perspective on dissent and courage. First, by
drawing attention to the importance of dissident democratic citizenship,
this approach encourages democratic theorists to pay closer attention to
dissident activities, and consequently to those people for whom the
promise of democracy has not been fulfilled. By recognizing the
political agency of dissidents and "marginals" as the agency of
citizens, democratic theorists can provide a richer account of
democratic citizenship than can theories that focus solely on sanctioned
deliberation. Second, by incorporating an ethic of political courage
into our conception of citizenship, this approach fills an additional
gap in our understanding of democracy as joint deliberation and action.
Political courage is important because it enables us to act and
communicate when faced with fear and uncertainty. Fear and uncertainty
are certainly confronted by dissidents who act in a context of
inequality, but this approach also suggests that courage is Holloway
Sparks 101 necessary for all citizens, not just those engaged in
dissent. As long as we think engaging in politics is something more than
"who gets what, when, and how," the challenges of conflict, connection,
and accountability will lie at the heart of being a citizen. Even if we
manage to eliminate the major inequalities that characterize our current
political environment, engaging in conflict and connection are risky
activities and will not happen (or will not happen well) without
courageous citizens. By scrutinizing the courage necessary for
dissidence, therefore, this perspective also explores the nature of a
practice that is fundamental to human beings who wish to communicate and
act together in the world. Third, this approach highlights the
limitations of the public-private split as it is commonly understood and
incorporated into democratic theories of citizenship. [By attending to
the dissident practices of marginals, and especially the dissident
practices of women marginals, this approach encourages democratic
theorists to broaden their understanding of where political
participation takes place, and to credit women for their public
activities]{.underline} (including dissent) [that occur in spheres and
locations traditionally viewed as private or apolitical]{.underline}.
Fourth, this approach encourages democratic theorists and others
interested in citizenship to examine the impact of race, class, gender,
and sexuality on democratic participation. Critically exploring how the
dissident and deliberative practices of women and other marginals are
negotiated and constructed respects the feminist call to examine gender
as it intersects and interacts with race, class, and sexuality in the
world. Finally, [this approach participates in the reclaiming of
courageous dissent as an important political practice for women and
other agents who face discrimination and oppression.]{.underline} [When
women and other dissidents conceive of themselves as courageous, new
possibilities for action as citizens are opened]{.underline}. As Mary
Dietz has suggested, by remembering and bringing to light the many
examples of courageous democratic practices already in existence, we
provide inspiration for activists still to come (Dietz 1987, 79).

#### Public discussion of arms sales key exposing the criminal actions of the government. 

**Hartung 16 **(William, director of arms and security project at the
center for international policy, 7/30/16, "The US government is
literally talking about arming the world, nobody's even talking about
it", <https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/tomdispatch-dc-congress-defense-international-arms-business/>)

**It's** [not that]{.underline} no one writes about [aspects of the arms
trade. There are occasional pieces that, for example, take note of the
impact of US weapons transfers, including cluster bombs, to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**, or of** the [disastrous dispensation of weaponry
to US allies in Syria, or of foreign sales of the costly, controversial
F-35 combat aircraft. And once in a while, if a foreign leader meets
with the president, US arms sales to his or her country might generate
an article or two. But the sheer size of the American arms trade, the
politics that drive it, the companies that profit from it, and its
devastating global impacts are rarely discussed, much less analyzed in
any depth.]{.underline} So here's a question that's puzzled me for years
(and I'm something of an arms wonk): [Why do other major US
exports]{.underline}---from Hollywood movies to Midwestern grain
shipments to Boeing airliners---[garner regular coverage]{.underline}
while trends in weapons exports remain in relative obscurity? [Are we
ashamed of standing essentially alone as the world's No. 1 arms dealer,
or is our Weapons "R" Us role so commonplace that we take it for
granted, like death or taxes?]{.underline} The numbers should stagger
anyone. According to the latest figures available from the Congressional
Research Service, the United States was credited with more than half the
value of all global arms transfer agreements in 2014, the most recent
year for which full statistics are available. At 14 percent, the world's
second largest supplier, Russia, lagged far behind. Washington's
leadership in this field has never truly been challenged. The US share
has fluctuated between one-third and one-half of the global market for
the past two decades**,** [peaking at an almost monopolistic 70 percent
of all weapons sold in 2011. And the gold rush
continues]{.underline}**.** Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who heads the
Pentagon's arms sales agency, euphemistically known as the [Defense
Security Cooperation Agency, estimates that arms deals facilitated by
the Pentagon topped \$46 billion in 2015, and are on track to hit \$40
billion in 2016. Arms deals are a way of life in
Washington]{.underline}. From the president on down, significant [parts
of the government are intent on ensuring that American arms will flood
the global market and companies]{.underline} like Lockheed and Boeing
will live the good life. From the president on his trips abroad to visit
allied world leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to the
staffs of US embassies, [American officials regularly act as salespeople
for the arms firms. And the Pentagon is their enabler]{.underline}**.**
From brokering, facilitating, and literally banking the money from arms
deals to transferring weapons to favored allies on the taxpayers' dime,
[it is in essence the world's largest arms dealer]{.underline}**.** In a
typical sale, [the US government is involved every step of the way. The
Pentagon often does assessments of an allied nation's armed forces in
order to tell them what they "need"---and of course what they always
need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied equipment]{.underline}.
Then the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the deal, notifies
Congress of its details, and collects the funds from the foreign buyer,
which it then gives to the US supplier in the form of a defense
contract. In most deals, the Pentagon is also the point of contact for
maintenance and spare parts for any US-supplied system. The bureaucracy
that helps make all of this happen, the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, is funded from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals it
negotiates. This gives it all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell.
[The degree to which the Obama administration has been willing to bend
over backward to help weapons exporters was underscored at a 2013
hearing on those administration export "reforms]{.underline}." Tom
Kelly, then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department's
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when
asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American
arms exports. He responded: "\[[We are\] advocating on behalf of our
companies and doing everything we can to make sure that these sales go
through...and that is something we are doing every day, basically \[on\]
every continent in the world...and we're constantly thinking of how we
can do better]{.underline}." One place where, with a helping hand from
the Obama administration and the Pentagon, the arms industry has been
doing a lot better of late is the Middle East. Washington has brokered
deals for more than \$50 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia alone
for everything from F-15 fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters
to combat ships and missile defense systems. [The most damaging deals,
if not the most lucrative, have been the sales of bombs and missiles to
the Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen, where thousands of civilians
have been killed and millions of people are going hungry.
Members]{.underline} of Congress like Michigan Representative John
Conyers and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy [have pressed for
legislation that would at least stem the flow of the most deadly of the
weaponry being sent for use there, but they have yet to overcome the
considerable clout of the Saudis in Washington]{.underline} (and, of
course, that of the arms industry as well). When it comes to the arms
business, however, there's no end to the good news from the Middle East.
Take the administration's proposed new 10-year aid deal with Israel. If
enacted as currently planned, it would boost US military assistance to
that country by up to 25 percent---to roughly \$4 billion per year. At
the same time, it would phase out a provision that had allowed Israel to
spend one-quarter of Washington's aid developing its own defense
industry. In other words, all that money, the full \$4 billion in
taxpayer dollars, will now flow directly into the coffers of companies
like Lockheed Martin, which is in the midst of completing a
multibillion-dollar deal to sell the Israelis F-35s.

### 2AC -- Ext - Law Key 

#### **The law shapes how we interpret and tell the narratives we create**

#### **Wharton '16 (Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller, Harvard University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture and the Humanities 1--11, pp. 5-6, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).** 

While the examples above focus on what narrative means to law,
**[law]{.underline}** also **[means much to narrative]{.underline}**,
particularly for writers such as Hayden White. White's discussion of
Hegel and the state's role in history's genesis highlights the law as an
essential condition of narrative: "**[Where there is no rule of law,
there can be neither a subject nor the kind of event which lends itself
to narrative representation."]{.underline}**14 For White, **["the
reality that lends itself to narrative representation is the conflict
between desire and the law." Perhaps even more significantly, "some
notion of the legal subject" must be present to "serve as the agent,
agency, and subject of historical narrative in all of its
manifestations, from the annals through the chronicle to the historical
discourse as we know it in its modern realizations and failures."
Notions of legal subjectivity underlie depictions of the subject in
narrative, whether that narrative subject acts within commonly accepted
legal bounds placed on individual agency, or whether that subject
transgresses or transcends such limits.]{.underline}** In White's
construction of history, [the law forms a sort of regulatory backdrop
against which events unfold and become visible and relatable as
narrative: If every fully realized story, however we define that
familiar but conceptually elusive entity, is a kind of allegory, points
to a moral, or endows events, whether real or imaginary]{.underline},
with a significance that they do not possess as a mere sequence, then it
seems possible to conclude that every historical narrative has as its
latent or manifest purpose the desire to moralize the events of which it
treats. Where there is ambiguity or ambivalence regarding the status of
the legal system, which is the form in which the subject encounters most
immediately the social system in which he is enjoined to achieve a full
humanity, the ground on which any closure of a story one might wish to
tell about a past, whether it be a private or public past, is lacking.
And this suggests that [narrativity, certainly in factual storytelling
and probably in fictional storytelling as well, is intimately related
to, if not a function of, the impulse to moralize reality, that is, to
identify it with the social system that is the source of any morality
that we can imagine.]{.underline}16 The law does more than circumscribe
action within a particular social context; it also exercises a profound
influence over the literary imagination. Mary L. Dudziak has recently
described "the way law makes an indelible mark, or acts as a
legitimizing force, affecting what historical actors imagine to be
possible," in the field of international relations.17 As White
challenges us to remember, **[law contributes substantially to how we
write and interpret the stories that we tell about ourselves and our
history.]{.underline}** We only know the law through the narratives we
create about it -- narratives that include statutes and judicial
decisions. And these legal narratives, like medieval chronicles and
Victorian novels, are generated by a fundamental epistemological
"impulse to moralize reality, that is to identify it with the social
system that is the source of any morality that we can imagine,"18 or to
put it another way, a desire to know the law. At the same time, the law
itself provides an essential condition for the legibility of all
narratives, both legal and non-legal. For example, Stephen Best has
asked us to consider, "How does the 'form' in the commodity form
generate social phenomena in ways that are neither mechanical
(historical causality) nor fully contingent (analogy)?"19 In stitching
together a history of property law in the United States, Best
demonstrates how a particular "figure of the person," one in which
personhood itself is increasingly figured as a species of property in a
wide variety of contexts, moved from law into culture and from culture
into the law.20 As a consequence, in spite of the potential discursive
discontinuities created by emancipation and constitutional amendment,
antebellum juridical constructions such as the "fugitive" continued to
inform the genesis and evolution of Equal Protection jurisprudence after
the Civil War.21 To see law and narrative as mutually interdependent as
Best or White does is to understand, as Jackson suggests, that the
"events" in a legal narrative include more than the transaction that
gives rise to a particular case, or the actions of lawyers, litigants,
and witnesses at trial. Such a perspective also opens the door to
considering aesthetics, poetics, and other aspects of form as essential
characteristics of sound legal decision-making. They are not mere
ornamentation of judicial process but perhaps as influential in shaping
the judicial process as the doctrine of stare decisis or the rules of
evidence. [If law is narrative then we must read legal narratives as
attempts at representation (rather than acts of perfect mimesis),
attempts that depend upon familiar strategies and tropes found in other
narrative genres, including fiction.]{.underline}

[Debate is a **means of settling differences**,]{.underline} [so there
**must be a**]{.underline} difference of opinion or a **[conflict of
interest]{.underline}** before there can be a debate. **[If everyone is
in agreement]{.underline}** on a tact or value or policy, [there is **no
need for debate**]{.underline}: **[the matter can be settled by
unanimous consent]{.underline}**. Thus, for example, [it would be
pointless to attempt to debate \"Resolved: That two plus two equals
four,\"]{.underline} because there is simply no controversy about this
statement. ([Controversy is an essential prerequisite]{.underline} of
debate. [Where there is no clash of ideas]{.underline}, proposals,
interests, or expressed positions on issues, **[there is no
debate]{.underline}**. In addition, [debate **cannot produce effective
decisions**]{.underline} [without **clear identification of a question
or questions to be answered**]{.underline}. For example, **[general
argument may occur about the broad topic of illegal
immigration]{.underline}**. [How many]{.underline} illegal immigrants
[are in the United States?]{.underline} What is the impact of illegal
immigration and immigrants on our economy? What is their impact on our
communities? Do they commit crimes? [Do they take job]{.underline}s from
American workers? Do they pay taxes? Do they require social services? Is
it a problem that some do not speak English? [Is it the responsibility
of employers to discourage illegal immigration]{.underline} by not
hiring undocumented workers? Should they have the opportunity- to gain
citizenship? Docs illegal immigration pose a security threat to our
country? [Do illegal immigrants do work that American workers are
unwilling to do?]{.underline} Are their rights as workers and as human
beings at risk due to their status? Are they abused by employers, law
enforcement, housing, and businesses? I low are their families impacted
by their status? What is the moral and philosophical obligation of a
nation state to maintain its borders? [Should we build a wall on the
Mexican border]{.underline}, establish a national identification can!,
or enforce existing laws against employers? Should we invite immigrants
to become U.S. citizens? [Surely you can think of many more concerns to
be addressed by a conversation about the topic area of illegal
immigration. Participation in this \"debate\" is likely to be emotional
and intense. However, it is **not likely to be productive or useful
without focus on a particular question**]{.underline} [and
identification of a line **demarcating sides in the
controversy**]{.underline}. To be discussed and resolved effectively,
**[controversies must be stated clearly]{.underline}**. **[Vague
understanding]{.underline}** [results in **unfocused deliberation** and
**poor decisions**]{.underline}, frustration, and emotional distress, as
**[evidenced by the failure of the United States Congress to make
progress on the immigration debate during the summer of
2007]{.underline}**.

[Someone disturbed by the problem of the growing underclass of poorly
educated, socially disenfranchised youths might observe, \"Public
schools are doing a terrible job!]{.underline} They are overcrowded, and
many teachers are poorly qualified in their subject areas. Even the best
teachers can do little more than struggle to maintain order in their
classrooms.\" That same concerned citizen, facing a complex range of
issues, might arrive at an unhelpful decision, such as \"We ought to do
something about this\" or. worse. \"It\'s too complicated a problem to
deal with.\" [Groups of concerned citizens worried about the state of
public education could join together to express their
frustrations]{.underline}, anger, disillusionment, and emotions
regarding the schools, **[but without a focus for their
discussions]{.underline}**, [they could easily agree about the sorry
state of education **without finding points of clarity or potential
solutions.**]{.underline} **[A gripe session would
follow]{.underline}**. [But if a **precise question** is
posed]{.underline}---such as \"What can be done to improve public
education?\"---[then a more **profitable area of discussion** is opened
up]{.underline} [**simply by placing a focus on the search** for a
concrete solution step]{.underline}. [One or more judgments can be
phrased in the form of debate propositions, motions for parliamentary
debate, or bills for legislative assemblies.]{.underline} The statements
\"Resolved: That the federal government should implement a program of
charter schools in at-risk communities\" and \"Resolved: That the state
of Florida should adopt a school voucher program\" more clearly identify
specific ways of dealing with educational problems in a manageable form,
suitable for debate. [They provide specific policies to be investigated
and aid discussants in identifying points of difference.]{.underline}

[To have a **productive debate, which facilitates effective decision
making**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} directing and **[placing limits
on the decision]{.underline}** to be made, **[the basis for argument
should be clearly defined]{.underline}**. [If we merely talk about
\"homelessness\" or \"abortion\" or \"crime\'\* or \"global warming\" we
are likely to have an interesting discussion but not to establish
profitable basis for argument]{.underline}. For example, **[the
statement \"Resolved: That the pen is mightier than the sword\" is
debatable, yet fails to provide much basis for clear
argumentation]{.underline}**. If we take this statement to mean that the
written word is more effective than physical force for some purposes, we
can identify a problem area: the comparative effectiveness of writing or
physical force for a specific purpose.

[Although we now have a **general subject**]{.underline}, we have not
yet stated a problem. **[It is still too broad]{.underline}**, too
loosely worded to promote well-organized argument. [What sort of writing
are we concerned with]{.underline}---poems, novels, government
documents, website development, advertising, or what? [What does
\"effectiveness\" mean]{.underline} in this context? What kind of
physical force is being compared---fists, dueling swords, bazookas,
nuclear weapons, or what? A more specific question might be. \"Would a
mutual defense treaty or a visit by our fleet be more effective in
assuring Liurania of our support in a certain crisis?\" [The basis for
argument could be phrased in a **debate proposition**]{.underline} such
as \"Resolved: That the United States should enter into a mutual defense
treatv with Laurania.\" Negative advocates might oppose this proposition
by arguing that fleet maneuvers would be a better solution. **[This is
not to say that debates should completely avoid creative
interpretation]{.underline}** of the controversy by advocates,
[or]{.underline} [**that good debates cannot occur over competing
interpretations of the controversy**; in fact, **these sorts of debates
may be very engaging**. The point is that debate is best facilitated by
the guidance provided by **focus on a particular point of difference**,
which will be outlined in the following discussion.]{.underline}

#### Competitive debate is a dialogue between two teams. Their willful refusal to defend the resolution is an act to exclude the negative from meaningful participation in the dialogue. Placing a priority on a balanced topic exists to provide a voice for both sides.

**Galloway, 7** --professor of communication at Samford University
(Ryan, "DINNER AND CONVERSATION AT THE ARGUMENTATIVE TABLE:
RECONCEPTUALIZING DEBATE AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE DIALOGUE", *Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate,* Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)

[Debate as a dialogue sets an argumentative table, where all parties
receive a relatively fair opportunity to voice their
position.]{.underline} Anything that fails to allow participants to have
their position articulated denies one side of the argumentative table a
fair hearing. [The affirmative side is set by the topic and fairness
requirements]{.underline}. While affirmative teams have recently
resisted affirming the topic, in fact, the topic selection process is
rigorous, taking the relative ground of each topic as its central point
of departure. [Setting the affirmative reciprocally sets the negative.
The negative crafts approaches to the topic consistent with affirmative
demands]{.underline}. The negative crafts disadvantages, counter-plans,
and critical arguments premised on the arguments that the topic allows
for the affirmative team. [According to fairness norms, each side sits
at a relatively balanced argumentative table]{.underline}. [When one
side takes more than its share, competitive equity suffers]{.underline}.
[However, it also undermines the respect due to the other involved in
the dialogue. When one side excludes the other, it fundamentally denies
the personhood of the other participant]{.underline} (Ehninger, 1970, p.
110). [A pedagogy of debate as dialogue takes this respect as a
fundamental component. A desire to be fair is a fundamental condition of
a dialogue that takes the form of a demand for equality of
voice]{.underline}. [Far from being a banal request for links to a
disadvantage, fairness is a demand for respect, a demand to be heard, a
demand that a voice backed by literally months upon months of
preparation, research, and critical thinking not be
silenced]{.underline}. [Affirmative cases that suspend basic fairness
norms operate to exclude particular negative strategies. Unprepared, one
side comes to the argumentative table unable to meaningfully participate
in a dialogue.]{.underline} [They are unable to "understand what 'went
on...'" and are left to the whims of time and power]{.underline}
(Farrell, 1985, p. 114). Hugh Duncan furthers this line of reasoning:
*[Opponents not only tolerate but honor and respect each other because
in doing so they enhance their own chances of thinking better and
reaching sound decisions]{.underline}. Opposition is necessary because
it sharpens thought in action. We assume that argument, discussion, and
talk, among free an informed people who subordinate decisions of any
kind, because [it is only through such discussion that we reach
agreement which binds us to a common cause...If we are to be
equal...relationships among equals must find expression in many formal
and informal institutions]{.underline}* (Duncan, 1993, p. 196-197).
[Debate compensates for the exigencies of the world by offering a
framework that maintains equality for the sake of the
conversation]{.underline} (Farrell, 1985, p. 114). For example, [an
affirmative case]{.underline} on the 2007-2008 college topic [might
defend neither state nor]{.underline} international [action]{.underline}
in the Middle East, [and yet claim to be germane to the topic in some
way. The case essentially denies the arguments that state action is
oppressive or that actions]{.underline} in the international arena [are
philosophically or pragmatically suspect. Instead of allowing for the
dialogue to be modified by the interchange of the affirmative case and
the negative response, the affirmative subverts any meaningful role to
the negative team, preventing them from offering effective
"counter-word" and undermining the value of a meaningful exchange of
speech acts. Germaneness and other substitutes for topical action do not
accrue the dialogical benefits of topical advocacy]{.underline}.

#### Resolutional Debates are key to clash

[Much of the controversy involves the resolution itself, and whether
teams should have to defend the resolution, or whether they can mount a
broader criticism of the activity]{.underline} (Snider, 2003). Steve
Woods notes that, "Academic debate is now entering a third state, a
critical turn in the activity. The identifying element of this change is
that abandonment of the role playing that the construct of fiat enabled"
(Woods, 2003, p. 87). This journal previously (2004) addressed issues
regarding the growing divide in policy debate. However[, the role of the
debate resolution in the clash of civilizations was largely ignored.
Here, I defend the notion that activist approaches of critical debaters
can best flourish if grounded in topical advocacy defined in terms of
the resolution. This approach encourages the pedagogical benefits of
debates about discourse and representations while preserving the
educational advantages of switch-side debate. Debaters' increased
reliance on speech act and performativity theory in debates generates a
need to step back and re-conceptualize the false dilemma of the "policy
only" or "kritik only" perspective.]{.underline} [Policy debate's
theoretical foundations should find root in an overarching theory of
debate that incorporates both policy and critical
exchanges]{.underline}. Here, I will seek to **[conceptualize debate as
a dialogue]{.underline}**, following the theoretical foundations of
Mikhail Bakhtin (1990) and Star Muir (1993) that connects the benefits
of dialogical modes of argument to competitive debate. Ideally, the
resolution should function to negotiate traditional and activist
approaches. [Taking the resolution as an invitation to a dialogue about
a particular set of ideas would preserve the affirmative team's
obligation to uphold the debate resolution. At the same time, this
approach licenses debaters to argue both discursive and performative
advantages.]{.underline} **[While this view is broader than many policy
teams would like, and certainly more limited than many critical teams
would prefer, this approach captures the advantages of both modes of
debate while maintaining the stable axis point of argumentation for a
full clash of ideas around these values.]{.underline}**

in the New Deal years, the Supreme Court stepped down from its 150-year
mission of limiting the scope of government according to the
restrictions laid out in the constitution. [In 1942, the court decided
that the Commerce Clause became]{.underline} (in the words of federal
judge Alex Kozinski), [the "Hey, You Can Do Anything You Like
Clause."]{.underline} At that time the court ruled, absurdly, that the
federales could fine an Ohio farmer for producing 239 more bushels of
wheat than allowed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act, even though he
consumed most of the wheat himself and sold the remainder nearby, on the
theory that what he was doing solely in Ohio amounted to "interstate
commerce." [In the same era, the Constitutional phrase authorizing laws
for the "general welfare" became another blank check. As Murray points
out, the meaning of "general welfare" was hashed out at great length
during debate about the Constitution.]{.underline} Both Madison and
Hamilton argued vigorously that "general welfare" was merely a phrase
meant to introduce the enumerated powers --- the specific acts to which
the federal government is limited. [The notion that Washington could do
whatever it liked provided the result was said to be for "general
welfare" would have struck the Framers as absurd. Today, federal
agencies, using those Supreme Court decisions and vaguely worded
statutes, are constrained only by the limits of their
imaginations.]{.underline} As Tocqueville foresaw, government now
"covers the surface of society with a network of small, complicated
rules, minute and uniform." [We live not under tyranny but a state that
"compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a
people."]{.underline} Effect change through the ballot box? Not a
chance. [There are two parties. One is for big government, the other is
for really shockingly huge government.]{.underline} Murray has lost
patience with the ordinary democratic process. He suggests willful,
determined, sustained resistance: "to make large portions of the Federal
Code of Regulations unenforceable. I want to make government into an
insurable hazard, like flood, fire, or locusts." He proposes the Madison
Fund. [Philanthropists, are you listening? This would be an attack squad
of lawyers on call to protect and defend Constitutional limits on
government.]{.underline} Getting slimed by bureaucrats? Call Govbusters.
Murray envisions the lawyers telling the government agents, "We are
taking over this man's case. We will litigate it as long as it takes. We
will publicize this litigation that will embarrass you and your
superiors. None of this will cost our client a penny, and we will
reimburse him for any fine you are able to impose. And if you come back
and bother him again, we will go through the whole process again." They
throw the book at you? Catch it, and throw it back. That's why God gave
us lawyers. This time they're on your side. [The Madison Fund would have
three purposes: To defend those who are innocent of regulatory charges
brought against them; to defend those who are technically guilty of
violating nonsensical regulations, in order to maximize the burden on
the government; and to generate as much publicity as possible to bring
public pressure to bear on the agencies and the elected and appointed
officials who oversee them.]{.underline} Would it work? Maybe not.
Wouldn't it be fun to try, though? Consider the amount of [money
spent](https://nypost.com/2015/06/14/a-resistance-movement-is-the-only-way-to-stop-out-of-control-government/)
in the 2012 campaign season: billions of dollars, and neither the White
House nor the Senate nor the House changed hands. [A single mischievous
billionaire could stir up a lot of trouble by seeding the Madison Fund.
What will the future look like? Ever-increasing government-fueled
stagnation and sclerosis? Murray thinks the country is inherently too
powerful, free and individualistic for that to happen. "National wealth
that dwarfs today's, and technology that gives the individual access to
total information and the ability to apply that information to everyday
life: Under those]{.underline}
[conditions](https://nypost.com/2015/06/14/a-resistance-movement-is-the-only-way-to-stop-out-of-control-government/)[,
it is unimaginable to me that Americans will still think the best way to
live is to be governed by armies of bureaucrats enforcing thousands of
minutely prescriptive rules. "Somehow," Murray believes, "the American
polity will have evolved toward more efficient ways of working and
living together." America stands alone. We're the only country built on
a basic framework structured to limit the reach of government and
empower individuals instead. If Murray is right, there is a way to
restore that promise.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Ext -- Legal Education

#### **We have a responsibility as scholars to evaluate the policy debate - we shape decision making**

#### Edkins and Zehfussi 5 (Review of International Studies (2005),31,p. 454-5)

What **[we are attempting]{.underline}** in this article is **[an
intervention that demonstrates how]{.underline}** the illusion of
**[the]{.underline}** sovereign **[state]{.underline}** in an insecure
and anarchic international system is sustained and how it **[might be
challenged.]{.underline}** It seems to us that **[this has become
important]{.underline}** in the present circumstances. The focus on
security and the dilemma of security versus freedom that is set out in
debates immediately **[after September 11th]{.underline}**
**[presents]{.underline}** an apparent choice as **[the focus for
dissent]{.underline}**, while concealing the extent to which thinking is
thereby confined to a specific agenda. Our argument will be that this
approach relies on a particular picture of the political world that has
been reflected within the discipline of international relations, a
picture of a world of sovereign states. **[We have a responsibility as
scholars; we are not insulated from the policy world. What we discuss
may not]{.underline}**, and indeed does not, **[have a direct impact on
what happens in the policy world,]{.underline}** this is clear, **[but
our writings]{.underline}** and our teaching **[do]{.underline}**
**[have an input in terms of the creation]{.underline}** and
reproduction **[of pictures of the world that inform
policy]{.underline}** and set the contours of policy debates.21
Moreover, the discipline within which we are situated is one which
depends itself on a particular view of the world -- a view that sees the
international as a realm of politics distinct from the domestic -- the
same view of the world as the one that underpins thinking on security
and defence in the US administration.22 In this article then we develop
an analysis of the ways in which thinking in terms of international
relations and a system of states forecloses certain possibilities from
the start, and how it might look to think about politics and the
international differently. **[The truth is often disturbing.
Our]{.underline}** impressive American **[victories against terrorism
and rogue states]{.underline}**, although proper and indispensable,
**[are]{.underline}** inevitably **[limited]{.underline}**. The words of
the great Irish poet Yeats reveal, prophetically, where our entire
planet is now clearly heading. **[Watching violence
escalate]{.underline}** and expand in parts of Europe and Russia, in
Northern Ireland, in Africa, in Southwest Asia, in Latin America, and of
course in the Middle East, **[we discover]{.underline}** with certainty
**[that]{.underline}** \"\... the centre cannot hold/Mere **[anarchy is
loosed upon the world]{.underline}**/The blood-dimmed tide is loosed/and
everywhere The Ceremony of innocence is drowned.\" **[Our
response]{.underline}**, even after Operation Iraqi Freedom, **[lacks
conviction]{.underline}**. Still **[pretending that \"things will get
better,\" we]{.underline}** Americans **[proceed]{.underline}**
diligently **[with our day-to-day affairs, content that, somehow, the
worst can never really happen]{.underline}**. Although it is true that
we must go on with our normal lives, it is also true that \"**[normal\"
has]{.underline}** now **[become a]{.underline}** quaint and
**[delusionary state]{.underline}**. We want to be sure that a \"new\"
normal falls within the boundaries of human tolerance, but we can\'t
nurture such a response without an informed appreciation of what is
still possible. For us, other rude awakenings are unavoidable, some of
which could easily overshadow the horrors of Sept. 11. There can be
little doubt that, **[within a few short years, expanding tribalism will
produce several new genocides and proliferating nuclear weapons will
generate]{.underline}** one or more **[regional nuclear
wars.]{.underline}** Paralyzed by fear and restrained by impotence,
various governments will try, desperately, to deflect our attention, but
it will be a vain effort. Caught up in a vast chaos from which no real
escape is possible, **[we will learn too late that there is no durable
safety]{.underline}** in arms, no ultimate rescue by authority, no
genuine remedy in science or technology.  What shall we do? For a start,
we must all begin to look carefully behind the news. **[Rejecting
superficial analyses of day-to-day events in favor of penetrating
assessments]{.underline}** of world affairs, **[we]{.underline}** must
**[learn]{.underline}** quickly **[to distinguish what is]{.underline}**
truly **[important]{.underline}** from what is merely entertainment.
**[With]{.underline}** such **[learning, we Americans could prepare
for]{.underline}** growing **[worldwide anarchy]{.underline}** not as
immobilized objects of false contentment, but as authentic citizens of
an endangered planet.  **[Nowhere is it written that we people of Earth
are forever]{.underline}**, that humankind must thwart the
long-prevailing trend among all planetary life-forms (more than 99
percent) of ending in extinction. Aware of this, **[we
may]{.underline}** yet **[survive]{.underline}**, at least **[for a
while]{.underline}**, but only if our collective suppression of
purposeful fear is augmented by a complementary wisdom; that is, that
our personal mortality is undeniable and that the harms done by one
tribal state or terror group against \"others\" will never confer
immortality. This is, admittedly, a difficult concept to understand, but
the longer we humans are shielded from such difficult concepts the
shorter will be our time remaining. We must also look closely at higher
education in the United States, not from the shortsighted stance of
improving test scores, but from the urgent perspective of confronting
extraordinary threats to human survival. For the moment,
**[some]{.underline}** college **[students are exposed to]{.underline}**
an occasional course in what is fashionably described as **[\"global
awareness,\"]{.underline}** but such exposure usually sidesteps the
overriding issues: **[We]{.underline}** now **[face a deteriorating
world system]{.underline}** that cannot be mended through sensitivity
alone; **[our leaders are dangerously unprepared]{.underline}** to deal
with catastrophic deterioration; our schools are altogether incapable of
transmitting the indispensable visions of planetary restructuring.  To
institute productive student confrontations with survival imperatives,
colleges and universities must soon take great risks, detaching
themselves from a time-dishonored preoccupation with \"facts\" in favor
of grappling with true life-or-death questions. In raising these
questions, it will not be enough to send some students to study in Paris
or Madrid or Amsterdam (\"study abroad\" is not what is meant by serious
global awareness). Rather, **[all students must be made
aware]{.underline}** - as a primary objective of the curriculum **[- of
where we are heading, as a species,]{.underline}** and where our limited
survival alternatives may yet be discovered.  There are, of course, many
particular ways in which colleges and universities could operationalize
real global awareness, but one way, long-neglected, would be best. I
refer to the study of international law. For a country that celebrates
the rule of law at all levels, and which explicitly makes international
law part of the law of the United States - the \"supreme law of the
land\" according to the Constitution and certain Supreme Court
decisions - this should be easy enough to understand. Anarchy, after
all, is the absence of law, and knowledge of international law is
necessarily prior to adequate measures of world order reform.  Before
international law can be taken seriously, and before \"the blood-dimmed
tide\" can be halted, America\'s future leaders must at least have some
informed acquaintance with pertinent rules and procedures. Otherwise we
shall surely witness the birth of a fully ungovernable world order, an
unheralded and sinister arrival in which only a shadowy legion of
gravediggers would wield the forceps.

### 2AC -- Ext -- Legal education - Simulation

#### Simulation of different roles through fiat encourages learning and empowerment

**Innes and Booher '99** (Judith, Director -- Institute of Urban and
Regional Development and Professor at UC Berkeley and David, Visiting
Scholar at the Institute, Journal of the American Planning Association,
Winter, Vol. 65, Iss. 1)

Our observation and practice of consensus building suggests that the
analogy to **[role-playing]{.underline}** games **[will]{.underline}**
help to **[illuminate the]{.underline}** dynamic of **[effective
consensus processes]{.underline}**. Even **[when the dispute seems
intractable, role playing]{.underline}** in consensus building **[allows
players to let go of]{.underline}** actual or assumed
**[constraints]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** to **[develop ideas
for]{.underline}** creating **[new]{.underline}** conditions and
**[possibilities]{.underline}**. Drama and suspension of reality allows
competing, even bitterly opposed interests to collaborate, and engages
individual players emotionally over many months. Scenario building and
storytelling can make collective sense of complexity, of **[predicting
possibilities in an uncertain world, and can allow the]{.underline}**
playful **[imagination, which people normally suppress, to go to
work.]{.underline}** In the course of engaging in various roles,
participants develop identities for themselves and others and become
more effective participants, representing their stakeholders\' interests
more clearly. In many of their most productive moments, **[participants
in consensus building engage]{.underline}** not only **[in playing out
scenarios]{.underline}**, but also in a kind of collective, speculative
tinkering, or bricolage, similar in principle to what game participants
do. That is, they play with heterogeneous concepts, strategies, and
actions with which various individuals in the group have experience, and
try combining them until they create a new scenario that they
collectively believe will work. **[This]{.underline}** bricolage,
discussed further below, **[is a type of reasoning and collective
creativity]{.underline}** fundamentally different from the more familiar
types, **[argumentation and tradeoffs]{.underline}**.\[sup11\] **[The
latter modes of problem solving]{.underline}** or dispute resolution
typically **[allow zero sum allocation of resources]{.underline}** among
participants or finding the actions acceptable to everyone. Bricolage,
however, produces, rather than a solution to a known problem, a new way
of framing the situation and of developing unanticipated combinations of
actions that are qualitatively different from the options on the table
at the outset. The result of this collective tinkering with new
scenarios is, most importantly, learning and change among the players,
and growth in their sophistication about each other, about the issues,
and about the futures they could seek. Both consensus building and
**[roleplaying]{.underline}** games **[center on learning, innovation,
and change]{.underline}**, in a process that is entertaining and-when
conducted effectively-in some fundamental sense empowers individuals.

#### Utopian policy proposals are valuable even if they are never enacted---they still put pressure on power to accede to demands and create a vision for social change

**Streeten 99** (Paul, Development, v. 42 n.2 ingenta)

First, **[Utopian thinking can be useful]{.underline}** as a framework
for analysis. Just as physicists assume an atmospheric vacuum for some
purposes, so **[policy analysts can assume a political vacuum from which
they can start afresh.]{.underline}** The physicists' assumption plainly
would not be useful for the design of parachutes, but can serve other
purposes well. Similarly, when thinking of tomorrow's problems,
**[Utopianism]{.underline}** is not helpful. But for long-term strategic
purposes it **[is essential]{.underline}**. Second, **[the Utopian
vision gives a sense of direction]{.underline}**, which can get lost in
approaches that are preoccupied with the feasible. **[In a world that is
regarded as]{.underline}** the **[second-best]{.underline}** of all
feasible worlds, **[everything becomes a necessary constraint. All
vision is lost]{.underline}**. Third, **[excessive concern with the
feasible tends to reinforce the status quo.]{.underline}** In
negotiations, it strengthens the hand of those opposed to any reform.
Unless the case for change can be represented in the same detail as the
case for no change, it tends to be lost. Fourth, it is sometimes the
case that the conjuncture of **[circumstances changes quite
suddenly]{.underline}** and that the constellation of forces,
unexpectedly, turns out to be favourable to even radical innovation.
**[Unless we are prepared with a carefully worked out]{.underline}**,
detailed **[plan]{.underline}**, that yesterday **[could have appeared
utterly Utopian, the reformers will lose out by default]{.underline}**.
Only a few years ago nobody would have expected the end of communism in
Central and Eastern Europe, the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the
unification of Germany, the break-up of Yugoslavia, the marketization of
China, the end of apartheid in South Africa. And the handshake on the
White House lawn between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat. Fifth, the **[Utopian
reformers themselves can constitute a pressure group, countervailing
the]{.underline}** self interested **[pressures of the obstructionist
groups]{.underline}**. **[Ideas thought to be Utopian have become
realistic]{.underline}** at moments in history **[when large numbers of
people support them]{.underline}**, and those in power have to yield to
their demands. **[The demand for ending slavery is a historical
example]{.underline}**. It is for these five reasons that **[Utopians
should not be discouraged from formulating]{.underline}** their
**[proposals]{.underline}** and from thinking the unthinkable,
unencumbered by the inhibitions and obstacles of political constraints.
They should elaborate them in the same detail that the defenders of the
status quo devote to its elaboration and celebration. **[Utopianism and
idealism will]{.underline}** then **[turn out to be the most realistic
vision.]{.underline}** It is well known that there are three types of
economists: those who can count and those who can't. But being able to
count up to two, I want to distinguish between two types of people. Let
us call them, for want of a better name, the Pedants and the Utopians.
The names are due to Peter Berger, who uses them in a different context.
The Pedants or technicians are those who know all the details about the
way things are and work, and they have acquired an emotional vested
interest in keeping them this way. I have come across them in the
British civil service, in the bureaucracy ofthe World Bank, and
elsewhere. They are admirable people but they are conservative, and no
good companions for reform. On the other hand, there are **[the
Utopians]{.underline}**, the idealists, the visionaries who dare think
the unthinkable. They **[are]{.underline}** also
**[admirable]{.underline}**, many of them young people. But they lack
the attention to detail that the Pedants have. **[When the day of the
revolution comes, they will have entered it]{.underline}** on the wrong
date in their diaries and fail to turn up, or, if they do turn up, they
will be on the wrong side of the barricades. What we need is a marriage
between the Pedants and the Utopians, between the technicians who pay
attention to the details and the idealists who have the vision of a
better future. There will be tensions in combining the two, but they
will be creative tensions. We need Pedantic Utopian Pedants who will
work out in considerable detail the ideal world and ways of getting to
it, and promote the good cause with informed fantasy. Otherwise, when
the opportunity arises, we shall miss it for lack of preparedness and
lose out to the opponents of reform, to those who want to preserve the
status quo.

#### Roleplaying is necessary to refuse our construction as passive client citizens---it's a more effective form of politics 

**Kulynych 97** [ ]{.underline}(Jessica, Winthrop University, Polity,
Winter, p. 344-5)

Unfortunately, it is precisely these **[elements of citizen action that
cannot be explained by]{.underline}** a **[theory]{.underline}** of
communicative action.  It is here that a performative conception of
political action implicitly informs Hager's discussion.  **[From a
performative perspective, the goal of action is not only to secure a
realm for deliberative politics, but to disrupt and
resist]{.underline}** the **[norms and identities]{.underline}** that
structure such a realm and its participants.  **[While Habermas
theorizes that political solutions will emerge from dialogue, a
performative understanding of participation highlights the limits of
dialogue]{.underline}** and the creative and often uncontrollable effect
of unpremeditated action on the very foundations of communication.
 **[When we look at the success of citizen initiatives from a
performative perspective, we look]{.underline}** precisely **[at those
moments of defiance]{.underline}** and disruption that bring the
invisible and unimaginable into view.  **[Although citizens were
minimally successful]{.underline}** in influencing or controlling the
outcome of the policy debate and experienced a considerable lack of
autonomy in their coercion into the technical debate, **[the
goal-oriented debate within the energy commissions could be seen as a
defiant moment of performative politics]{.underline}**.  The existence
of a goal-oriented **[debate within a]{.underline}** **[technically
dominated arena defied the normalizing separation between expert
policymakers and consuming citizens.  Citizens momentarily recreated
themselves as policymakers]{.underline}** in a system that defined
citizens out of the policy process, thereby **[refusing their
construction as passive clients.]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- Ext -- Debate is Good - Skills

#### Policy debates about hypothetical government action are good. Builds skills and fosters learning that can't be found elsewhere

**Bauschard & Champ, 11 **\[Stefan and Cheryl, writers for DebatesUS!

Competitive Policy Debate, (2011). Debateus.org. Retrieved 8 July 2019,
from <https://debateus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bc2.pdf>\]

[Although some of the benefits of competitive Policy Debate, such as
developing an understanding of current and contemporary issues, critical
thinking, problem solving and public speaking can be captured in the
classroom, developing debate as an after school and competitive weekend
learning program affords opportunities to acquire significant additional
skills]{.underline}. Students have the opportunity to engage with
contemporary issues for an extended period of time, learn to work
together as part of a large group, benefits from intellectual gains that
spring from debating both sides of the resolution, are afforded
extensive opportunities for developing speaking and refutation
skills, [master in-depth and reflexive research and have the chance to
compete against students with similar skills who come from different
backgrounds]{.underline}. Since the structured academic debate outside
the classroom is competitive, students are driven to excel vis a vis
their peers. This often results in students doing extensive research
that debaters engage in is extensive, yearlong, reflexive, and diverse.
Some have estimated that the amount of research a nationally competitive
high school debater does is equivalent to the amount to research needed
to complete a master's thesis (Parcher, 1998) Since teams will debate
many opponents multiple times throughout the year, the [research and
argument development needs to account for changes in their opponent's
arguments and work toward developing new ideas]{.underline} to keep the
debates fresh. The diversity and quantity of arguments that can come
into play in any given [Policy Debate round also require debaters to
organize, synthesize and evaluate arguments]{.underline} that have been
written by coaches and other members of the team for use in their
debates. And since the [debates often involve matters of public policy,
scientific feasibility and moral issues the research is inherently
interdisciplinary]{.underline}. As the season advances, debaters must
continually adjust adapt, develop and often entirely revise their
arguments if they wish to reamin effective. All of the topics that
Policy debaters address, from limiting the use of weapons of mass
destruction, to reducing aggressive detention practices, and providing
social services to the poor, are [pulled from the headlines dealing with
the most controversial and timely issues of the day.]{.underline} In a
world of standardized curriculums and testing, students may not
otherwise have an opportunity to explore these relevant, contemporary
issues in such depth. Since many individual two-person teams make up a
squad where research and argument ideas are shared, debaters have
self-interest in working together to develop ideas that will benefit the
entire team. And since every squad is made up of many debaters who
possess diverse levels of experience and skill, [a debate squad is a
great place for peer-to-peer modeling and cooperative
learning.]{.underline}

#### It's a voting issue and outweighs their offense -- their attempt to exclude the negative obliterates the pedagogical benefits of in-round dialogue. Fairness norms are vital because they allow [both]{.underline} teams to be heard in a meaningful way. Debate as dialogue is vital to refine and develop positions, test ideas and is a prerequisite to meaningful political participation

**Galloway, 7** --professor of communication at Samford University
(Ryan, "DINNER AND CONVERSATION AT THE ARGUMENTATIVE TABLE:
RECONCEPTUALIZING DEBATE AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE DIALOGUE", *Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate,* Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)

A second reason to reject the topic has to do with its exclusivity.
[Many teams argue that because topicality and other fairness constraints
prevent particular speech acts, debaters are denied a meaningful voice
in the debate process]{.underline}. Advocates argue that because the
negative excludes a particular affirmative performance that they have
also precluded the affirmative team. [The problem with this line of
reasoning is that it views exclusion as a unitary act of definitional
power. However, a dialogical perspective allows us to see power flowing
both ways. A large range of affirmative cases necessitates fewer
negative strategies that are relevant to the range of such cases. If the
affirmative can present any case it desires, the benefits of the
research, preparation, and in-depth thinking that go into the creation
of negative strategies are diminished, if not eviscerated
entirely]{.underline}. The affirmative case is obliged to invite a
negative response. In addition, [even when the negative strategy is not
entirely excluded, any strategy that diminishes argumentative depth and
quality diminishes the quality of in-round dialogue. An affirmative
speech act that flagrantly violates debate fairness norms and claims
that the benefits of the affirmative act supersede the need for such
guidelines has the potential of excluding a meaningful negative
response, and undermines the pedagogical benefits of the in-round
dialogue. The "germ of a response]{.underline}" (Bakhtin, 1990) [is
stunted]{.underline}. [While affirmative teams often accuse the negative
of using a juridical rule to exclude them, the affirmative also relies
upon an unstated rule to exclude the negative response]{.underline}.
This unstated but understood rule is that the negative speech act must
serve to negate the affirmative act. Thus, [affirmative teams often
exclude an entire range of negative arguments, including arguments
designed to challenge the hegemony, domination, and oppression inherent
in topical approaches to the resolution]{.underline}. Becoming more than
just a ritualistic tag-line of "fairness, education, time skew, voting
issue," **[fairness exists in the implicit right to be heard in a
meaningful way]{.underline}**. [Ground is just that---a ground to stand
on, a ground to speak from, a ground by which to meaningfully contribute
to an ongoing conversation.]{.underline} Conversely, [in a dialogical
exchange, debaters come to realize the positions other than their own
have value, and that reasonable minds can disagree on controversial
issues. This respect encourages debaters to modify and adapt their own
positions on critical issues without the threat of being labeled a
hypocrite]{.underline}. [The conceptualization of debate as a dialogue
allows challenges to take place from a wide variety of perspectives. By
offering a stable referent the affirmative must uphold, the negative can
choose to engage the affirmative on the widest possible array of
"counterwords," enhancing the pedagogical process produced by
debate]{.underline}. Additionally, debate benefits activism by exposing
the participants to a wide range of points of view on topics of public
importance. A debater starting their career in the fall of 2005 would
have debated about China, landmark Supreme Court decisions, Middle East
policy, and agricultural policy. It is unsurprising that many debaters
contend that debate is one of the most educationally valuable
experiences of their lives.

### 2AC -- Ext -- Debate is Good -- Decision-Making Skills

#### WE ARE ALL POLICY MAKERS. Debating about alternative government policies is the best way to instill a METHOD OF DECISIONMAKING that is useful in all parts of life. 

**Ross Smith, former debate coach at Wake Forest University, 7**
(4/4/2007, Ross K., "Challenge to the Community,"
<https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox>, )

Policy: a course of action undertaken by an agent. [We are all policy
makers every time we decide to undertake a course of action. Most
policies are non-governmental. We have an obligation to ourselves and
others to be good policy makers and advocates of good policies when
dealing with others in our spheres of influence. Policy Deliberation and
Debate: a METHOD for making and advocating better policy decisions.
**Intercollegiate debate about PUBLIC policy: a useful way of teaching
the SKILLS needed for successful use of a METHOD of making and
advocating good decisions. Public policy topics are especially useful
because the research base is public.** While we could debate about
private actions by private agents, we have no way of poviding equal
access to the kinds of information that would help make those debates
good ones.]{.underline} **[There is a side benefit that some of what we
learn about the public policy topics sometimes informs our later lives
as citizens engaged in public deliberation regarding those same
policies, but that is not the primary reason that public policy topics
are necessary]{.underline}**. [Andy Ellis is a policy maker. He makes
decisions about courses of action for himself and for/with others. But a
topic about what Andy Ellis should do is inaccessable and, frankly,
largely none of our business.]{.underline} But Andy Ellis has been well
served by having the training in one of the better methods of choosing
among and advocating whatever policies he is responsible for. That
method is policy debate. [Debate about public policy is a subset of
debate about policy, **a subset that is \"debatable\" because there is a
common research base. The fact that the subject matter is at a remove
from us personnally while still residing in the \"public sphere\" is a
feature, not a bug.**]{.underline}

#### Our encounter with the apocalypse is an aesthetic approach -- this opens up space for imagining a new world

Poetry and Apocalypse Page 40)JFS

**[Envisioning an end]{.underline}** to the game of the present in all
spheres of social and political life, with its embittered alignments and
its entrenched impasses, as insidiously difficult as that may be for us
to "do" (as Beckett's Endgame so wittily insinuates), **[enables us to
envisage]{.underline}**, and so also to beginning to enact, **[new
possibilities]{.underline}**. And yet, **[apocalypse]{.underline}**, as
the advent of the end, **[is nothing that we can do, though we can be
aware of]{.underline}** and perhaps cooperate with **[its
happening]{.underline}** to us. Indeed, from a certain point of view,
this is already what our tradition itself is all about.
**[Apocalyptic]{.underline}**, as the ultimate expression of
transcendent, metaphysical **[vision]{.underline}** in poetry, **[rather
than being taken as an aberration]{.underline}**, symptomatic of a
pathology of Western civilization **[that could be cured, should be
accepted as part of the whole and as standing for the possibility of
renewal]{.underline}** inherent within this tradition. **[From this type
of imagination, new]{.underline}** and different
**[proposals]{.underline}** unceasingly **[draw their
inspiration]{.underline}**. All representations and imaginings have
their limits. Apocalypse thematizes this inherent destiny for every
order of imagination to have its end and give place to a new, thitherto
unimaginable order. **[Every]{.underline}** imagination of the end in
**[apocalyptic style is the occasion for new orientation toward
the]{.underline}** open space we call the **[future]{.underline}**. This
future, however, is not for us to name, in the end, since it is beholden
to the Other. And this may mean -- and has meant, in the terms forged by
a certain tradition embracing Dante, Celan, and Stevens -- being
beholden to an apocalypse, to the revelation of the "eternity" that
surpasses us utterly and unutterably.

### 2AC -- Ext -- Deliberative Democracy

#### Deliberative democracy is inherently good for minorities and gives them a platform for them to consent to laws

**Wheatley '04** (Steven Wheatley is the senior Lecturer in Human Rights
Law and International Law, Department of Law, University of Leeds;
"Deliberative Democracy and Minorities"; published 2004; accessed
7/8/2019) // krys

The emerging '[democratic norm']{.underline} thesis in international law
has been rightly criticized for focusing too heavily on institutional
arrangements and the holding of competitive elections.6 It [appears to
conceive of a thin model of democracy, whereby the function of
government is to aggregate the preferences of individuals to find the
decision that will be acceptable to most]{.underline}. In extreme
versions[, the role of the citizen is simply to determine who will hold
power.]{.underline} [The people do not actually rule in any obvious
sense of the terms 'people' and 'rule', and democratic government
becomes the rule of the elected politician]{.underline}.7 This
aggregative model is not conducive to realizing the interests and
preferences of those minority groups with a high degree of solidarity
and shared outlook, which find themselves permanently outvoted by the
majority population.8 [Even if they are represented in decision-making
processes, there is nothing to prevent the more powerful and numerous
participants from ignoring them]{.underline}. **[No right of cultural
security can be guaranteed]{.underline}**. Yet the UN Declaration on
Minorities and the UN Commission on Human Rights have both concluded
that the issue of minorities can only be resolved 'within a democratic
framework'.9 **[A more inclusive model must then be conceived, one in
which decisions are based not only on the counting of votes, but also on
the sharing of reasons]{.underline}**. Democratic legitimacy depends
upon the will of the people to their being governed by those in power.10
Sovereignty lies with the people,11 who rule on a basis of political
equality.12 The core democratic principles of equality and popular
sovereignty are typically conceived to be antagonistic: the 'rights of
the individual' versus the 'will of the people'. This is not the case
under the deliberative model of democracy. The citizen is seen as both
the subject of the law and its author. The fact [that x and y determine
that some restriction should be placed in z does not make their decision
right simply because they constitute a majority in a voting process that
weighs each of their votes equally]{.underline}. Sometimes it is
necessary that a decision is made. If x, y and z are walkers who come to
a fork in the path they must go left or right. According to John Locke[,
the majority in a democracy have the right to determine policy, as it is
necessary that the body politic should 'move that way whither the
greater force carries it'. The only alternative would be the consent of
each individual, but 'such consent is next impossible ever to be
had']{.underline}.13 But if x and y determine that z should carry all
the equipment and they should carry none then z not being treated as an
equal in the relationship. Only if z agreed to the proposal would it be
acceptable: a person cannot complain that their rights have been
violated when they themselves have freely agreed to the interference in
their liberty. Thus, according to Kant, **[for a law to be legitimate it
must enjoy the 'united and consenting will of all']{.underline}**.14
Democracy, according to the deliberative model, is a system of
government that gives each citizen a genuinely equal share in the
exercise of power. Crucially, it requires that laws are introduced only
where a consensus exists following public deliberation and reasoned
argument between citizens as to what should be done.15 Seyla Benhabib
has argued that [deliberative democracy is not simply an additional
theoretical model about how democracies should be constructed, but one
that elucidates some aspects of the logic of democratic practices better
than others]{.underline}, albeit inimperfect form.16 [It is a model
which finds implicit recognition in the judgments of national
constitutional courts and international human rights bodies and one
which sits more easily with the principle of equality and with the
internal aspect of the right to self-determination, which requires that
the government of a state be representative of all the
people]{.underline},17 **[not simply a majority]{.underline}**.18
Recognizing the nature of democracy as deliberation not aggregation is
not an argument for reconstructing liberal democracy, but for a
different understanding of how it functions. For those international
organizations committed to democratic rule, the Organization of American
States,19 the European Union,20 the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe,21 and the Commonwealth,22 a deliberative
understanding of democracy demands that member states do not simply
concern themselves with the question as to whether free and fair
elections have taken place, but also with issues of political equality,
representation and regard for the views and interests of minorities.23
[The requirements of the deliberative model]{.underline} [of democracy
are]{.underline} outlined by Julia Black: [imperfect form. It is a model
of democracy that potentially applies to all associations of free and
equal individuals]{.underline}. This would include a group of housemates
who must agree responsibilities for a variety of domestic tasks. There
will be no obvious answer as to who should be responsible for what[. An
open]{.underline}, reasoned,25 [discussion amongst equal and uncoerced
participants]{.underline}, the deliberative model argues, [will produce
a consensus as to what is to be done that is rational, fair and
legitimate]{.underline}. The same point may be made about the
heterogeneous or plural state. There are no universal values that we can
look towards to tell us what policies should be introduced. No single
normative principle of multiculturalism that a Court might apply to tell
us how to respond to claims for cultural rights from different groups in
different contexts.26 This was made clear in Société des Acadiens v.
Association of Parents, where the Canadian Supreme Court concluded that
the language rights expressed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were
matters of 'political compromise', and that judicial bodies 'should
pause before they decide to act as instruments of change with respect to
\[such\] rights'.27 **[Rational, fair and legitimate policies concerning
minorities can only emerge from a process of democratic
deliberation]{.underline}**.

#### Public intentions, especially those of minorities, are clarified through deliberative democracy

**Wheatley '04** (Steven Wheatley is the senior Lecturer in Human Rights
Law and International Law, Department of Law, University of Leeds;
"Deliberative Democracy and Minorities"; published 2004; accessed
7/8/2019) // krys

[The first requirement of deliberative democracy is an open political
agenda to which all may contribute]{.underline}. Democracy is a system
of government in which equal citizens determine the answer to the basic
political question: 'What ought we to do?'28 It is a system of ongoing
deliberation.29 As noted by the Canadian Supreme Court in Re Secession
of Quebec: [The original]{.underline} Athenian [conception of democracy
depended upon direct participation by citizens who engaged in 'proper
discussion']{.underline}. Decisions and laws rested on the force of
better argument.31 The United Nations' Commission on Human Rights has
argued that democratic government requires the widest participation in
the democratic dialogue by all sectors and actors of society in order to
come to agreements on appropriate solutions to social, economic and
cultural problems.32 [Deliberation is everywhere in the modern
democratic state, it takes place at meetings of pressure groups,
political parties, in universities, in the media, and innumerable places
where individuals engage in communicative debate on political
questions]{.underline}.33 [Through public deliberation]{.underline}, the
German Federal Constitutional Court has concluded, [political goals
become clarified, and a public opinion emerges which forms the
beginnings of political intentions]{.underline}.34 [There]{.underline}
must be, within this public sphere, [a tolerance for a wide diversity of
political opinions and points of view]{.underline}. In a number of cases
involving Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights has considered [the
extent of tolerance for political deliberation required of the
democratic state:]{.underline} Political debate may only be limited
where it does harm to democracy itself.36 Thus a political party may
campaign for a change in the law on two conditions: (1) the means used
to that end must be legal and democratic; and (2) the change proposed
must itself be compatible with fundamental democratic principles.37
Beyond this, [any and all political programmes may be proposed and
debated]{.underline}, '[even those that call into question the way a
state is currently organised]{.underline}'.38 [Minority groups may
participate in political deliberation through formally constituted
political parties and organizations or as part of the general
opinion]{.underline}- and will-formation in the public sphere. **[This
is a right protected by the international human rights instruments, and
includes the freedom to establish political parties specifically
dedicated to the advancement of minority interests and
preferences]{.underline}**.39 The proposals of the group may be radical
in nature, including autonomy40 and even secession.41 [What emerges from
this deliberative communication are the constitutional norms and legal
rules that will dictate the political arrangement. They will differ from
state to state, reflecting the outcomes of those societies' ongoing
deliberations]{.underline} as to the best form of government suited to
their particular circumstances in the light of current and past
experiences.

#### You should evaluate our arguments based on credibility and evidence -- reversion to personalized bases of knowledge eradicates the possibility of common knowledge and educational development.

**Hammersley, 93** -- Prof. Education and Social Research @ Centre for
Childhood, Development and Learning @ Open U \[Martyn, British Journal
of Sociology, "Research and \'anti-racism\': the case of Peter Foster
and his critics," 44.3, 11-93, JSTOR\]

I suggest that [the assessment of substantive and methodological claims
should be based on judgments about the plausibility and credibility of
evidence with attempts to resolve disagreements]{.underline} such as
that between Foster and his critics, being pursued through a search for
common ground and an attempt to argue back from that to some conclusion
that all will accept. By \'plausibility\' here I mean what I referred to
earlier as consistency with existing knowledge whose validity is taken
to be beyond reasonable doubt. By \'credibility I mean (Martyn
Hammersley) the likelihood that the process that produced the claim is
free of serious error. Here I am assuming that factual claims vary in
their credibility both according to their own content and according to
the circumstances in which they were produced. [Where a claim is neither
sufficiently plausible nor credible to be accepted at face value,
evidence for it must be examined in terms of its plausibility and
credibility, and so on until a judgment can be made]{.underline} or
until judgment must be suspended for want of the necessary evidence.
[Where there is initial disagreement, ideally this process will result
in the acceptance by all of one or other of the two original positions,
or]{.underline} (more likely) [the construction of a third
position]{.underline}( for example through clarification of the concept
of racism); though unlike with foundationalism [there is no guarantee
offered that disagreement will be resolved]{.underline}. It seems to me
that [maximizing the chances that agreement will be reached in this way,
and that the resulting consensus will capture the truth, requires a
research community operating on the basis of the following
norms:]{.underline} 1 [The overriding concern of researchers is the
truth of claims, not their political implications or practical
consequences.]{.underline} 2 [Arguments are **not judged on the basis of
the personal and/or social characteristics of the person advancing
them**, but in terms of their plausibility and credibility]{.underline}.
3 [Researchers are willing to change their views if arguments from
common ground suggest those views are false; and, equally important,
they assume]{.underline} (and behave as if) [fellow researchers have the
same attitude - at least until there is very strong evidence
otherwise]{.underline}. 4 [Where agreement does not result, all parties
must recognize that there remains some reasonable doubt about the
validity of their own positions, so that whenever the latter are
presented they require supporting argument, or reference to where such
argument can be found]{.underline}. 5 [The research community is open to
participation by anyone able and willing to operate on the basis of the
first four rules]{.underline}; though their contributions will be judged
wanting if they lack sufficient knowledge of the field and/or of
relevant methodology. In particular, there must be no restriction of
participation on the grounds of personal characteristics religious or
political attitudes. In my view, [a research community committed to the
above norms maximizes the chances of discovering error in empirical and
theoretical claims, and of discovering the truth about particular
matters. It encourages the cumulative development of a body of knowledge
whose validity is more reliable]{.underline} on average than that of lay
views about the same issues. [This is not to say that in any particular
instance current research-based knowledge will be correct and
commonsense wrong; simply that it will usually be closer to the
truth]{.underline}. Furthermore, [it should be noted that this advantage
is bought at considerable cost in terms of the time taken to complete
inquiries in this way, and]{.underline} (correspondingly)[the limited
size of the body of research-based knowledge that can be
produced.]{.underline}

#### Personal Debates deter participation for fear of personal attacks, turning the FW

**Hansen 18** - Morten T. Hansen is a professor at the University of
California, Berkeley, and a faculty member at Apple University, Apple.
He is the author of Great at Work and Collaboration and co-author
of Great by Choice. He was named one of the top management thinkers in
the world ; 1-10-2018, \"The Problem with Most Meetings Is That There's
Not Enough Debate,\" Harvard Business Review,
<https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-to-have-a-good-debate-in-a-meeting> ;
7-8-2019

The modern workplace is awash in meetings, many of which are terrible.
As a result[, people mostly hate going to meetings. The problem
is]{.underline} this: [The whole point of meetings is to have
discussions that you can't have any other way. And yet most meetings are
devoid of real debate. To improve the meetings you run, and save the
meetings you're invited to, focus on making the discussion more robust.
When teams have a good fight during meetings, team members debate the
issues, consider alternatives, challenge one another, listen to minority
views, and scrutinize assumptions. Every participant can speak up
without fear of retribution. However, many people shy away from such
conflict, **conflating disagreement and debate with personal
attack**s]{.underline}. In reality, this sort of friction produces the
best decisions. In my recent study of 5,000 managers and employees,
published in my recent
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Work-Performers-Better-Achieve/dp/1476765626/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515454088&sr=8-1&keywords=great+at+work),
I found that the best performers are really good at generating rigorous
discussions in team meetings. (The sample includes senior and junior
managers and individual contributors from a range of industries in
corporate America; my aim was to statistically identify work habits that
correlate with higher performance.) So how do you lead a good fight in
meetings? Here are six practical tips: [Start by asking a question, not
uttering your opinion]{.underline}. In one meeting I was invited to as
an adviser, the boss started out by saying, "I think we should do X; I
would like your opinion." Then he went around the table, and everyone in
the room raised their hand in support, with zero objections. If you want
a real discussion, start with a question. Why? [First, it frames the
problem to be debated. If the problem is too general, the discussion
will go all over the place; if it's too narrow, that will limit the
options. So spend time thinking about the best question. And make sure
it isn't leading, meaning it doesn't bias the answers. Second, it
signals that you want real debate, not just a charade of one. Third, it
invites people with different ideas to speak up.]{.underline} Help quiet
people speak up (and don't let the talkers dominate). Even with good
questions, many people refrain from speaking up. Some are intimidated,
particularly new hires and junior people. Others fear retribution. Some
won't speak their true opinions for political reasons. And introverted
people dislike the discomfort of a rough-and-tumble discussion with loud
voices. Yet many of these people have important contributions to make.
To draw them in, try to "warm call" them ahead of the meeting, as one
top performer in my study did: "Sometimes I'll talk to folks in advance
of a meeting, saying, 'Hey, we're going to have this meeting. I know you
have a particular viewpoint, and I think [it's very important that it
gets heard]{.underline}, so I'd like to make sure you share it with the
group.'" Then lend your support ("Thank you for that important input").
It's better to try to get people to speak up in a group meeting than to
revert to one-on-one discussions. When you get people to speak in
meetings, you benefit from the group's collective wisdom, so people can
build on one another's comments and ideas. [Make it safe for people to
take risks --- don't let the sharks rule. Create an atmosphere of
psychological safety, as Harvard professor Amy Edmondson [calls
it](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=23399), a "climate
in which people feel free to express work-relevant thoughts and
feelings.]{.underline}" In my study, about one-fifth of participants
(19%) were adept at creating such climates. As the data showed, those
who scored highly performed better (the correlation was 0.63; perfect
correlation would be 1.0, and random chance would be 0). A study of
[team effectiveness at
Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)
showed the same. To create such a climate, lead by example ("Let me just
throw out a risky idea..."); support those who try ("I really appreciate
you suggesting..."); and sanction those who ridicule others ("I don't
want that kind of language here..."). Take the contrarian view. When I
was teaching [the American Express turnaround
case](https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/396212-PDF-ENG) at HBS,
Harvey Golub, then the company's CEO, came to class. He explained that
he would often take the contrarian view: If the meeting was about
raising the price for a service, he would show up and ask whether they
should lower the price. It forced people to have really solid arguments
for their views. A top performer in my study used a similar tactic to
provoke a reaction: "I sometimes throw out a ridiculous answer; I find
people will speak up and say 'That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.'"
You can also ask a colleague to play devil's advocate, where you ask
them, for the sake of argument, to take the opposing view. But make sure
to get the opposing view on the table. Dissect the three most
fundamental assumptions. In the infamous [Bay of Pigs
Invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion), where
President John F. Kennedy's team launched a botched invasion of Cuba,
his team failed to dissect a crucial assumption --- that the invasion by
some 1,400 Cuban exiles would lead to a popular uprising against the
Castro regime. President Kennedy might well have called off the flawed
plan had he known how shaky that assumption was. To avoid such
calamities, go after assumptions like a prosecutor goes after a
criminal: Do a deep dive yourself, get other experts to dive deep, and
get the team to be extremely thorough. One of the managers in our study
kept asking the team one tough question: "What are the key assumptions,
and what data will make them flawed?" Cultivate transparent advocates
(and get rid of the hard sellers). When you buy a used vehicle on a car
lot in the United States, the salesperson will tell you everything
that's good about the car and nothing that's bad. That's the hard sell
[--- highlighting the positives and downplaying the negatives. You want
people to propose ideas and be passionate about them, but you also want
them to be totally honest about the potential negatives. The problem is
that there's a human tendency to shift from being a transparent advocate
(showing the plan, warts and all) to becoming a used car salesperson:
**People are led astray by [confirmation
bias](https://hbr.org/2017/03/root-out-bias-from-your-decision-making-process)**]{.underline},
where they pay attention to data that confirms their idea, and they
[escalate
commitments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) by
continuing to advocate for their plans even in the face of negative
information. You can combat this tendency by forcing people to show the
negative: "When you present in the meeting tomorrow, I want to see a
slide with the five biggest risks, and we will spend lots of time
discussing them, so be prepared." Or you can ask for a pre-mortem:
"Assuming your idea will fail, what would be the key reasons for the
failure?" The purpose of a meeting is to have a debate that will result
in a great decision. How you as a manager or participant behave in those
meetings to improve debate matters a great deal. **[Don't hate meetings;
make them better]{.underline}**.

### 2AC -- AT: Body Ptx: Parability DA

#### Placing the body at the forefronts of discussion subjects para-abled bodies to the medical model and charitable gazes, all of which are counterproductive to creating a  para-abled identity.

**Loja et al. 2012 **(Emma Loja, Maria Emilia Costa, Bill Hughes, and
Isabel Menzes. Faculty of Psychology and Education Science at the

**[Non-disabled responses to visible impairment embody either social
invisibility or over-attentiveness]{.underline}**. The subjective and
inter-subjective experiences of impaired bodies and intersubjective
encounters within society are important aspects of disablement and the
construction of a disabled identity. Impairment is read by and inﬂuences
the social structure of ableism. This paper attempts to understand
how **[ableist discourses about impaired bodies have impacted on and
been resisted by disabled people and how embodiment is related to
identity]{.underline}**. In pursuit of these aims, a qualitative study
was conducted with seven people who have visible physical impairments.
The results indicate that **disabled embodiment is produced and
experienced within an ableist context that mobilizes the charitable gaze
and the medical model to signify impaired bodies**[ at the expense of
the recognition of disabled identity]{.underline}. In order to
deconstruct ableism and to recognize and respect the value of the
disabled identity, a politics of recognition is required

#### Embodiment assumes an abled body subject. The theory reaches it limitations with disability because there is not a universal body or mind.

**Monceri 2014 **(Dr. Flavia Monceri, Ph.D in Social Sciences.
Department of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education at Universita
degli Studi del Molise. 2014. Date Accessed 7/8/2019 // ONW)

But this is not the case. [**We** usually **talk about embodiment** as
it were something we can more or less understand in shared terms, **as
if** that **«physical and mental experience of existence»
were** something we perceive more or less in **the
same **way]{.underline}, for at the end of the day we are all "human
beings". This happens just [because **the notion of embodiment
presupposes a notion of the bod**y, and ultimately of human being, that
we are used to understanding as definable **in universal
terms**]{.underline}, despite all individual differences, and
particularly despite the fact that there is no possibility to make two
individual embodiments overlap, given the uniqueness of the individual
body. This is the reason why I find that the only legitimate task that
theory -- abstract by definition -- can perform in this case is that of
problematizing its own assumptions, showing just its inability to
trespass its borders to enter the realm of concreteness. Therefore[, **I
will** try to **problematize the notion of embodiment** by means of
considering the case of the so-called "disabled" bodies, using them as a
kind of trojan-horse **to show the biased presuppositions of the usual
discourse about body and embodiment**]{.underline}, which is rooted in
an implicit, but clear-cut, understanding of nature. My theoretical
position is close to those suggested by Critical Disability Studies
(Meekosha and Shuttleworth 2009; Shildrick 2012; Goodley 2013), Crip
theory (McRuer 2006), and Studies in Ableism (Campbell 2009). As it is
well-known, Disability Studies (DS) uncovered the constructed character
of what is usually defined "disability" just highlighting the fact that
the body is a social institution. As Garland-Thomson (2005: 524)
stresses, «**[Disability Studies points out that ability and disability
are not so much a matter of the capacities and limitations of bodies but
more about what we expect from a body at a particular moment and
place]{.underline}**». In the terms I am using here, this amounts to say
that each concrete body is intersubjectively evaluated on the basis of
the social, cultural and political expectations concerning the "normal"
or the "ruling body" that is however a social construction for which
those «capacities and limitations» defining the concrete and unique body
under scrutiny are not relevant at all, if they are not consistent with
those envisaged by the model. [What DS as a whole have succeeded in
showing is that the label "disability" is a social construction whose
condition of possibility lies in the existence of a clear-cut definition
of the normal body. And of course this implies also a catalogue of
normal embodiments, that is to say of the «physical and mental
experience(s) of existence» that ought to be considered as fully
human]{.underline}. However, there is a second relevant aspect that DS
are able to highlight by means of investigating the social constructed
character of "disability", as  again Garland-Thomson rightly points out:
Disability studies reminds us that all bodies are shaped by their
environments from the moment of conception. We transform constantly in
response to our surroundings and register history on our bodies. The
changes that occur when body encounters world are what we call
disability. The human body varies tremendously in its forms and
functions. Our bodies need care; we all need assistance to live. Every
life evolves into disability, making it perhaps the essential
characteristic of being human (2005: 524).  Put differently, [**bodies
cannot be conceived if not referring to embodiment**, which is bounded,
in its turn, to environment and time.]{.underline} The lived experience
of each and every human body unfolds as an unceasing and ongoing series
of practices, that is to say interactions both with the nothuman and the
human "outside", without forgetting the ones occurring at the level of
the single body itself. Therefore, the idea that «embodied social
relations exist both as the context (the prior circumstances) and as an
outcome (a consequence) of given social formations, given systems
through which we create and gain social meaning» (Cregan 2006: 3) can be
surely extended to all types of human relations with the environment,
without limiting it to the ones taking place among human beings as if
they lived in a vacuum. As a consequence, granted that a newborn body
has been evaluated as perfectly corresponding to the ruling one within a
society -- that is to say the one considered as "corresponding to
nature" and therefore "normal" -- this is not sufficient to state that
this condition will be maintained during the entire life-course just
because of embodiment, that is to say just because life unfolds as a
number of practices that are very heavily dependent on environmental
conditions and the passage of time

African American Women as Property: Valuing a Woman by the Yield of her
Womb S**[treet harassment\'s invasion of women\'s privacy has an al-
ternative meaning in the context of African American
women]{.underline}**. Street harassment disrespects a woman\'s right to
be left alone. However, **[rights are only \"guaranteed\" to citizens
and, as prop- erty, slaves were denied rights.]{.underline}**2°6
Therefore, [when an African American woman experiences the degradation
of street harass- ment, she is reminded that she need not be afforded
respect]{.underline} - as \"property,\" she is not entitled to the
guarantees of citizenship. Furthermore[**, the objectifying nature of
street harassment evokes African American women\'s embodiment as
property.** During slavery, slave women slave women were objectified
were exploited as \"breeders,\"207 as wombs. Slave owners coerced
consecutively in order to increase also encouraged the rape of slave
slave women to have children their labor force.]{.underline}208 Breeding

exploitation of slave wo- men\'s body parts and the objectification of
slave women as sexual beings was central to the perpetuation of slavery,
so the sexual objectification of women in street harassment perpetuates
gender domination.]{.underline}** Lastly, finding that the cult of true
womanhood ideology denied them a sexual outlet for their contempt of all
women, **[white men recharacterized slave women as Jezebels or
\"sexually aggressive women,\" thereby incarnating slave women as sexual
objects.]{.underline}** The Jezebel image \"lent further credibility to
the myth that black females were inherently wanton and therefore respon-
sible for rape.\"\'21\' Consequently, the comment \"Hey momma\" or
\"Jezebel\" to an African American woman conflates notions of
motherhood, 212 reproduction, and women as sexual objects, and forces an
African American woman to recall her prior status as a sexually
exploited breeder. Including African American women\'s experiences in
the street harassment discourse enlightens women to their multiple
consciousness and provides all women with a tool that enables them to
cope with the social and psychologically oppressive ef- fects of street
harassment. **[Angela Harris states that \"\[t\]his sense of a
mu3ltiplicitous self is not unique to black women, but black women have
expressed this sense in ways that are striking, poignant, and
potentially useful to feminist theory]{.underline}**. 213 By embracing
the multiplicitous self, African American wo- men, as the descendants of
slaves, have learned how to handle the multiple forms of oppression,
including gender and racial op- pression. Recognizing a multiple
consciousness helps women to deconstruct and accept their experiences
with street harassment. **[By embracing the multiple parts of self, and

this contradiction: **[\"In order to live from day to day, they must

dissonance created by street harassment causes mental

maddening]{.underline}**. It is to be both Self and Other, and to be
torn between them. In such a divided state of mind, one\'s perceptions
of others, of one\'s relations to them, and of oneself become
untrustworthy. This chaotic mo- ment can seem like madness, to which one
responds with a desperate struggle to understand and explain. When,
then, a woman turns into the Subject-as-Object, as in street hassling,
she can feel as though she were losing her mind. As if to pre- vent her
from going crazy, thoughts and feelings rush in, mate- rializing into a
ghostly chorus, each voice shrieking a contradictory explanation for
what just happened or a conflict- ing instruction about what to do about
it.216 African American women have historically and consistently existed
in a zone of dissonance. **[African American women]{.underline}**, as
society\'s \"other**[\" are]{.underline}**, in a multiple of ways,
**[disenfranchised and excluded from society]{.underline}**. **[At the
same time]{.underline}**, **[African American wo- men are \"essential

belonging.]{.underline}** Harris\' request that we embrace our multiple
consciousness allows all women to expect to be treated as \"object\" and
\"sub- ject.\" The multiple consciousness is yet another site of
identity, where both the subjective self and objective self co-exist.
**[Recog- nizing this site of identity will allow women to shift their
energies from deconstructing and understanding women\'s response to
street harassment, to eradicating street harassment.]{.underline}**218

### 2AC -- AT: Black Framework - SSD

#### SSD doesn't solve the impacts of framework - the process of the topic decision itself is rooted in traditional pedagogy 

**Dillard-Knox 2014** (Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain : the
challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy debate.\"
(2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161.)

**[The biggest defense for the set prescriptive rubric for debating the
topic is]{.underline}** the theory of **[switch-side debate
(SSD).]{.underline}** According to Casey Harrigan (2008) that rubric
―requires students to argue both for and against a given topic during
the course of a season. As part of this process, it has been generally
accepted that student debaters are allowed, if not encouraged, to ‗step
outside of the box' and gain additional insight into controversial
issues during contest rounds by arguing on the behalf of positions that
they 68 do not personally hold (p. 37).‖ Aside from the fact that **[SSD
does not account for difference in discoursal styles,]{.underline}**
**[there are a couple of other reasons that SSD does not account for
difference. The premise behind the benefits of SSD is that this format
encourages debaters to argue on behalf of positions that they do not
personally hold; allowing for pragmatic, pedagogical, and social
benefits. In theory, SSD is productive and beneficial.]{.underline}**
However, **[the way that the topic is constructed limits the pedagogical
and social possibilities of SSD.]{.underline}** **[Understanding the
process of topic selection is a pre-requisite for examining the
implications of topic construction]{.underline}** on the benefits of
SSD. **[The topic selection process occurs in several
stages.]{.underline}** The first stage is an open call for papers, where
any member of the community can submit a controversy paper. According to
the CEDA National website, [the goal of this stage of the process is to
develop papers that outline the \'problem areas\' involved with a public
policy controversy and provide some guidance as to how such a topic
might develop.]{.underline} A controversy paper is then selected by a
mail ballot of all CEDA member schools. During the second stage the
selected controversy is researched with an interest in developing the
possible specific propositions (or resolutions) for the coming season in
the form of wording papers. The committee and community will both be
invited to prepare such wording papers. Finally **[there is a topic
meeting]{.underline}**, open to the membership, to finalize the slate of
specific propositions **[to be voted on by all of the CEDA member
schools.]{.underline}** On face, this is a neutral process that allows
for all of the CEDA membership to have an ―equal‖ voice in the process
of topic selection. Unfortunately, **[the break down occurs at the level
of the voting, much like in the larger ―democratic‖ society. Voting 69
becomes a numbers game whereas, the majority has voting
power]{.underline}**. While this is true of any democratic voting
process, **[the ability to maintain a majority has historically
advantaged traditional debaters and coaches. Thus the language of the
topic has been constructed in ways that reinforce the pedagogical and
social values of traditional debate.]{.underline}** At the heart of the
arguments in favor of or against SSD lies the topic.

### 2AC -- AT: Black Framework - Political efficacy

#### Dialogue with the government is actually bending to its will

**Mead** 20**15** -- Lawrence M. Mead is a professor in the department
of politics at New York University, where he is currently professor of
politics and public policy; 5-17-2015; \"Only connect: Why government
often ignores research,\" SpringerLink,
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y>; Date
Accessed: 7-6-2019

[Why has academic policy research played little role in social policy
developments since 1980? One obvious reason is politics. Most academic
poverty experts are politically left of center. From that position, the
transfer model of programming, where government does more for the poor,
comes naturally]{.underline}. After national politics turned rightward
after 1980, that approach became less politic. There was now more
emphasis on limiting dependency on government and, especially, on
raising work effort among the poor[. One reason was rising budgetary
pressures due to the rising costs of larger entitlement
programs---Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid---which have always
cost much more than smaller welfare and service programs]{.underline}.
There simply was less money to spend on new antipoverty initiatives than
formerly. There were also political limits to the right. [Some
conservative experts sought simply to cut back welfare, but Congress
chose chiefly to condition aid on work. Very few researchers supported
the strategy of work requirements that in fact came to
dominate.]{.underline} The larger problem is that most policy research
gives little attention to politics. Most poverty experts concentrate on
measuring and analyzing poverty and other social problems, and on how
they might be assuaged. While they advise government to act, they say
little about government or politics themselves. Due to the Model 1
image, government is assumed willing and able to "do the right thing"
once it is shown what that requires. But in reality, policy choice
always faces political constraints. Public executives must struggle to
reconcile what they want to do with what legislators will approve and
what administrators can execute. Often, the goals of enacted programs
are simply unclear. For administrators, grasping these political limits
is the most crucial learning they do. They get little help from most
policy research. Of course, some policy experts do focus on politics[.
Typically, political scientists study what government actually does and
the politics of those issues. But these scholars, for their part,
typically say little about the merits of policy. Thus, they too are
little help to policymakers]{.underline} (Palumbo
[1992](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR48);
Rogers
[1989](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR50)).
That stance reflects longstanding inhibitions in political science
against taking positions on policy issues (Nelson
[1977](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR46)).
Thus, the irony: economists and sociologists tell government what to do
but otherwise ignore it, while most political scientists do address
government but will not tell it what to do. [**To gain government's ear,
policy scholars must link policy argument with political analysis**.
They must show how to address a policy problem "on the merits," but also
discuss political and institutional limitations. To make desired policy
and the political process consistent may require changes in one or the
other]{.underline}. Only by wresting with those trade-offs do
researchers sit where policymakers do. Only then can they help them
(Mead
[2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR39)).
The implication is not necessarily that politics has a veto over good
policy ideas. Congress often does defer to interests that oppose change,
but it will also defy them if a broader interest that requires reforms
becomes salient to the public (Arnold
[1990](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR4)).
One notable example was the deregulation movement of the 1970s and
1980s. Congress dismantled rules controlling prices in airlines, energy
and other economic sectors despite opposition from both management and
unions, because doing so would lower costs for consumers (Derthick and
Quirk
[1985](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR9)).
Another case was tax reform in 1986, when many preferences for business
were cut to permit lower overall tax rates (Birnbaum and Murray
[1988](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR7)).

sufficient poke. The judges unanimously disagreed. This year, a Wake

against Texas with this counterplan]{.underline}**, [but have apparently

debaters themselves assuming the role of agents of change push the
envelope of legitimate fiat by raising the question: does the power (or
privilege) of fiat extend to one's own self? Or to put the question
differently**[, is fiat reflexive]{.underline}**? Approaching the
question from the received perspective, [the answer clearly must
be]{.underline}** [no: fiat only affords the option to defend
governmental, not private action]{.underline}**. In this piece, I
question the normative worth of this received view of fiat and propose
that there are good reasons for permitting the opportunity for debaters
to present their own actions as voting alternatives in contest rounds.
My argument will unfold in the course of a brief three part discussion.
In part one, I highlight the structural differences between received and
reflexive views of fiat and consider how these differences shape the
political trajectory the debate community as a progressive agent of
social change. In part two, I sketch the basic features of reflexive
fiat and illustrate its emancipatory potential as a social movement
mobilization tool. In part three, I anticipate objections to the theory
of reflexive fiat and offer constructive reactions.**

### 1NC -- Link - Scopophilia 

#### In fetishistic scopophilia, the feminine is fetishized by the masculine because she is a reminder of castration and needs to become something reassuring rather than dangerous. To be seen as a woman in a patriarachal society traps the woman between phallic masculinity and passivity. 

**Bywater 90 -** William Bywater, Philosophy Ph.D. from University of

Evil\", Film Criticism, Vol. 14, No. 3, Special Issue on Psychoanalysis

Before we can speak about these scenes we have to return to Mul vey\'s
account of visual pleasure so we can begin to develop an understand- ing
of the postoedipal pleasure of looking. She assigns this pleasure almost
exclusively to men: \"[In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure
in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female
(]{.underline}Pleasure, 62). Scopophilia is transformed when it enters
the world of sexual imbal- ance. First, because it retains its
assignment as an active element in person- ality, it becomes associated
with the male. Mulvey, like E. Ann Kaplan after her (Chapter 1), easily
moves from speaking about the gaze as (phallic) masculine to speaking
about it as male. Thus, she does not discuss how the earlier pleasure of
phallic[, polymorphous scopophilia is now squeezed through the oedipus
to become male heterosexual desire with its accompanying demand for
female passivity]{.underline}. Second, the image from the mirror stage
is used now to hide the absence of erotic gazing by men at men. [When
men look at men (or at least heroes) in the movies, men are not looking
at an erotic object but identifying with a replica of the perfect image
which first appeared in the mirror. \"The character in the story can
make things happen and control events better than the subject/spectator,
just as the image in the mirror was more in control of motor
coordination,]{.underline} \" Mulvey says (Pleasure, 63). Mulvey\'s
discussion of male (postoedipal) masculinity posits that heterosexual
men experience the female figure as ambivalent -an object of erotic
attraction and a reminder of the danger of castration. To derive visual
pleasure from the female figure the fear of castration which it arouses
is offset by either sadistic voyeurism or fetishistic scopophilia, she
says. **[In fetishistic scopophilia, \"complete disavowal of castration
\[is accomplished\] by the substitution of a fetish object or turning
the repres- ented figure itself into a fetish so that it becomes
reassuring rather than dangerous\...]{.underline}**\" (Pleasure, 64).
**[Fetishization is designed to hide castration either by focusing on a
part of the figure (or something associated with the figure) or by
taking one element of the figure as essential to, and definitive of, it.
Sadistic voyeurism requires of its female object that it be controlled
and manipulated into admitting to (or at least revealing) the guilt that
brought about castration and into the appearance (at least) of no longer
misbehaving]{.underline}**. This appearance can be established by either
punishing or forgiving the errant woman. [Punishment and/or forgiveness
assures the voyeur that he will not be infected by the condition for
which the woman was originally castrated.]{.underline} Once phallic
masculinity is repressed, Mulvey sees only one opportunity for women\'s
postoedipal visual pleasure. \"\[I\]t is always possible that the female
spectator may find herself as out of key with the pleasure on offer,
with its \"masculinization,\" that the spell of fascination is broken.
On the other hand, she may not. She may find herself secretly,
unconsciously almost, enjoying freedom of action and control over the
diegetic world that identification with a hero provides\"
(Afterthoughts, 70). \"\[F\]or women (from childhood onwards) trans-sex
identification is a habit that very easily becomes second Nature \"
(Afterthoughts, 72. Italics in text.) **[Mulvey observes that any
attempt \"to represent the feminine in patriarchal society\" will trap
women between a set of tomboy pleasures (phallic masculinity) and an
existence centered on passivity]{.underline}** (Afterthoughts, 78). This
observation applies as well to men whose representation in patri- archy
oscillates between tomboy pleasures and hyperactivity. [There are times
when our experience of cinema reawakens the tom- boy pleasures in both
men and women and leads us to desire more of them]{.underline}. When
that desire is set lose in a patriarchal context it will come into
conflict with adult sexuality. **[Patriarchy then attempts to seduce us
away from those childish pleasures and to repress them. This continuous
and unending process of seduction/repression is a delicate business, for
it must avoid enraging those who are losing the familiar pleasures while
it substitutes pleasures of adulthood that often look far less
appealing]{.underline}**. There are several points at which Touch of
Evil offers its viewers a substitution for the scopophilic pleasure we
experienced with Mike-and-Susan. At no point does it appear that the
film satisfies us or itself that there is an adequate replacement. After
the explosion of the Linneker car, Mike sends Susan back across the
border to the hotel where they are staying. Susan has no interest in
returning to the hotel[. Her phallic masculinity still
unrepressed]{.underline}, [she wants to]{.underline} stay with Mike and
[take an active role in the murder investigation.]{.underline} She
leaves his side reluctantly. We follow her. On the way to the hotel,
Pancho- who is a member of the Los Robles branch of the Grandi family-
accosts her and takes her to meet Uncle Joe Grandi. Just before they
were married Mike finished a big drug case that put some members of the
Mexico City branch of the Grandi family in jail. So, once the couple is
split apart, [Uncle Joe takes the opportunity to try some intimidation
tactics on Susan. In the encounter Susan gives as good as she gets. She
is not intimidated. As she leaves his office Uncle Joe runs his tongue
across his lips in a gesture of sexual assault against Susan. He would
like to see her punished for the \"crimes\" of calling him names and not
showing him sufficient respect]{.underline}. In this scene Grandi
becomes the bridge across which we could move from the preoedipal to the
posteodipal. The Grandi figure tempts us. **[He tempts us to see Susan
as a sexual object, a woman in patriarchy]{.underline}**. Because the
Grandi figure is as much clown as criminal, moreover, we might see his
invitation as harmless. After all, can his threat against Susan be taken
that seriously? Isn\'t all this lip licking just for effect, just a
joke? The desire that breaks free as Mike and Susan turn to kiss and the
car explodes can be owned by either a woman or a man. The desire is to
reestablish a pleasure-producing relationship with Mike-and-Susan. Thus,
the desire can be seen as preoedipal and polymorphous perverse. Yet, our
interest in Mike and Susan is now a desire-an event whose very existence
is entwined with the oedipal transition. In this scene (our?) Uncle Joe
calls us toward the male masculine pleasures oř sadistic scopophilia.
[If we are willing to think that Susan has done wrong in going alone
with one unknown man (Pancho), a foreign stranger, to meet another
unknown man, if we are willing to think that she was lucky to get off
with just a funny face from Joe Grandi, if we are willing to think that
Susan had better get off her high horse and go back to the hotel as Mike
told her to do, then our pleasure in this scene shifts from phallic to
sadistic scopophilia]{.underline}. Uncle Joe might tempt us with this
adult pleasure, but Susan\'s vigor, and her invocation of Mike\'s name
as Grandi threatens her, makes it clear that to choose for Grandi is to
choose against Mike-and-Susan. We are still in search of a pleasure
producing relationship with them.

### 1NC -- Link -- Visible Identity

#### The visibility of the racial, national, or sexual Other is a problem for the attempted closure within discourse through a complex display of power between the subject and the object of gazes.

**Nathan 17** - Vetri Nathan, PhD Stanford University, Associate

For Young, [colonial obsession over demarcation of minute degrees of
mixed racial identity resulted in both an establishment of a discourse
that miscegenation would result in degeneration of purer races and yet,
by doing so, also brought fetishistic attention to the possibility of
inter-racial unions. As discussed in the first chapter, Bhabha's
description of the colonial stereotype-as-fetish provides a fruitful
framework to understanding how discourses are "fixed" vis-à-vis the
cinematic representation of the immigrant question in
Italy.]{.underline} If cinema is indeed a "desiring machine" then the
understanding of how the stereotype functions to regulate desire would
be an important path to understanding the cultural work of new migrant
cinema and how it might depart from or parallel the race and
sex-obsessed "colonial desiring machine," as Young calls it. [As already
noted, Bhabha's stereotype works like Freud's fetish. It is a
contradiction, a split, in that what it substitutes (the phallus) is
also the basis of the confirmation of its lack. The stereotypeas-fetish,
in other words, sets itself up for its own failure just as it forcibly
impresses identity]{.underline}. Its anxious repetition is therefore
needed, yet that very repetition constantly undermines its stability:
[**The visibility of the racial/colonial Other is at once the point of
identity** ("Look, a Negro") **and at the same time a problem for the
attempted closure within discourse**]{.underline}. (Bhabha 115--16)
**[If visibility of the racial Other is a problematic yet universal
point of entry into identity---and postcolonial discourse creation in
new migrant cinema does function as a "machine of desire," as Young
describes the colonial mentality---cinematic representations of
inter-racial and intra-racial desire can be successfully analyzed to
better understand how an Italian oikos is being negotiated through these
films]{.underline}**. Indeed, [all the productions considered in this
book, whether more realistic or humoristic in style, must confront the
issue of the visibility of the national, racial, or sexual Other,
complicated further by the national, racial, or sexual Self's own
chronic ambivalence. **What therefore is inevitable is a complex
interplay of power between the subject and the object of the
gazes**.]{.underline} The purpose of this chapter is to examine these
complex interactions in order to better understand the positioning of
both immigrants and Italians, men and women, within the body politic of
the Italian nation. What emerges from these explorations is, for me,
both unsurprising and intriguing. All the films in this chapter
represent visual vectors that perpetuate and/or subvert societal
imbalances and inequalities of gender, race, and nationality. Some
films, such as Pummarò (Tomato), that initially seem to provide didactic
messages of acceptance of Italy's new others, on further analysis turn
out to show just how perniciously they continue to (consciously or
unconsciously) perpetuate historical hegemonies. Other films, such as
Lezioni di cioccolato (Chocolate Lessons) which only appear to present
themselves as lighter forms of entertainment, sometimes contain far more
interesting and unexpected moments of suspension of gender inequalities.
What can be safely concluded is that most of the films studied here have
until now not been closely mined within the existing scholarship to
unearth all their hidden contradictions.

### 1NC -- Link - Pain Narratives 

#### Pain narratives are bad- they reinforce harmful narratives of queer folk, the same narratives from the people that tell us we should kill ourselves, we're AIDs infested, and that we should kill ourselves. Focusing on disproving popular narratives of what queerness is, and how queer folks end up committing suicide, squanders time we could be using to reimagining queer life. 

**Goltz, 2013** Dustin Bradley.at. \"It gets better: Queer futures,
critical frustrations, and radical potentials.\" *Critical Studies in
Media Communication* 30.2 (2013): 135-151.

Further frustrating this dialogue, Veldma (2010) critiques IGB as
''garbage'' trying to be passed off as ''some stunning and praiseworthy
act of compassion.'' Specifically, he argues, ''Too few people have
up-close and personal experience with depression and suicide to offer
productive advice.'' [Across all of the IGB videos and essays analyzed
for this essay, there was a second theme that was consistent across the
entries\*the recurrent admission of suicidal thoughts, ideation, or
attempts by self-identified LGBTQ submissions]{.underline}. Complicating
Veldman's claim, [growing up LGBTQ places one in relation to discourses
of hopelessness and suicide in mainstream homophobic
culture]{.underline} that are inescapably up close and personal. Steward
pleads, ''suicide is never the only option'' (In Savage & Miller, 2011,
p. 265). The statement is compelling, [exposing how\*far too It Gets
Better 147 often in the minds of LGBTQ youth\*suicide is an option.
Discursively, suicide is always on the table, placed in front of LGBTQ
youth, an ever-present and intelligible possibility.]{.underline} One
danger that still requires attention is how, with the growing visibility
of IGB, [the discursive link between queer youth and suicide is
potentially reified]{.underline}. This everpresence of suicide as an
option reiterates the complicated and debilitating relationship between
LGBTQ youth and future that has been present for decades. [The old myths
of the monstrous and predatory queer creature (In Savage & Miller, 2011,
pp. 111, 185, 234), the inevitability of AIDS (p. 114), the
impossibility of happiness (pp. 134, 213), the harder life (pp. 131,
241), predicted misery (p. 155), or gayness being a ''death sentence''
(]{.underline}p. 308) are exposed, critiqued, and extended in this
project. Potentializing mediated generativity, IGB challenges the
bordered homes and unique isolations queer youth experience (p. 8) from
lack of role models, normative mediated representation, and the
self-destructiveness that queer isolation and internalized homophobia
can produce (p. 292). The project offers a tapestry of experiences that
testify to multiple forms of family, friendship, community, and support
systems that may seem currently unimaginable to isolated queer youths.
The project includes politicized critiques of its own videos, while
garnering exposure for global queer movements (p. 25), intersectional
discussions of power and privilege (p. 89), and multiple forms of
political activism. The campaign is not two people, but the voices of
tens of thousands. The IGB project includes voices of queers of color
critiquing white celebrity privilege (p. 45), voices arguing activism is
their ''better'' (p. 24), and other voices who derive strength from
Christianity (pp. 30, 75, 206). Yet, in the next video or essay, you can
find an articulation of ''better'' that narrates Christianity as
oppressive and debilitating (pp. 182, 196). What this demonstrates is
the power of co-existent contradictions. While some stories express joy
in the normative dimensions of their futures, others call for lives of
creativity and vision that challenge and rewrite social scripts (p.
289). As Puar (2010) argues, ''Viral technology is only as good as its
participants,'' and the strength of this project is an ongoing dialogue
that fuels the discursive proliferation of all the differing ways the
queer future gets (and is getting) bettered.

#### Pain narratives allow for the commodification of pain and allows for the comfort to speak for others and re-write their pain.

Understanding [marginality as]{.underline} position and place of
[resistance is crucial for oppressed]{.underline}, exploited, colonized
people. If we only view the margin as sign marking the despair, a deep
nihilism penetrates in a destructive way the very ground of our being.
It is there in that space of collective despair that one\'s creativity,
one\'s imagination is at risk, there that one\'s mind is fully
colonized, there that the freedom one longs for as lost. Truly the mind
that resists colonization struggles for freedom one longs for is lost.
Truly [the mind that resists colonization struggles for freedom of
expression]{.underline}. The struggle may not even begin with the
colonizer; it may begin within one\'s segregated, colonized community
and family. So I want to note that I am not trying to romantically
re-inscribe the notion of that space of marginality where the oppressed
live apart from their oppressors as \'pure.\' I want to say that these
margins have been both sites of repression and sites of resistance. And
since we are well able to name the nature of that repression we know
better the margin as site of deprivation. [We are more silent when it
comes to speaking of the margin as site of resistance. We are more often
silenced when it comes to speaking of the margin as site of
resistance]{.underline}. Silenced. During my graduate years I heard
myself speaking often in the voice of resistance. I cannot say that my
speech was welcomed. I cannot say that my speech was heard in such a way
that it altered relations between colonizer and colonized. Yet what I
have noticed is that those [scholars, most especially those who name
themselves radical critical]{.underline} thinkers, [feminist
thinkers]{.underline}, now fully [participate ,in the construction of a
discourse about the \'Other.\']{.underline} I was made \'Other\' there
in that space with them. [In that space in the margins, that lived-in
segregated world]{.underline} of my past and present. [They did not meet
me]{.underline} there in that space. [They met me at the
center]{.underline}. They greeted me as colonizers. I am waiting to
learn from them the path of their resistance, of how it came to be that
they were able to surrender the power to act as colonizers. I am waiting
for them to bear witness, to give testimony. [They say that the
discourse on marginality, on difference has moved beyond a discussion of
\'us and them.\' They do not speak of how this movement has taken
place]{.underline}. This is a response from the radical space of my
marginality. It is a space of resistance. It is a space I choose. \'[I
am waiting for them to stop talking about the \'Other,\' to stop even
describing how important it is to be able to speak about difference. It
is not just important what we speak about, but how and why we
speak]{.underline}. Often this [speech about the \'Other\' is also a
mask, an oppressive talk hiding gaps]{.underline}, absences, that space
where our words would be if we were speaking, if there were silence, if
we were there. This \'we\' is that \'us\' in the margins, that \'we\'
who inhabit margin.al space that is not a site of domination but a place
of resistance. Enter that space. Often [this speech about the
\'Other\']{.underline} annihilates, [erases: \'No need to hear your
voice when I can talk about you better than you can speak about
yourself. No need to hear your voice. Only tell me about your pain. I
want to know your story. And then I will tell it back to you in a new
way. Tell it back to you in such a way that it has become mine, my own.
Re-writing you, I write myself anew. I am still author, authority. I am
still the colonizer, the speaking subject. and you are now at the center
of my talk.\' Stop.]{.underline} We greet you as liberators. This \'we\'
is that \'us\' in the margins. that \'we\' who inhabit marginal space
that is not a site of domination but a place of resistance. Enter that
space. This is an intervention. I am writing to you. I am speaking from
a place in the margins where I am different, where I see things
differently. I am talking about what I see.

#### The aff's liberal critique of suffering domesticates it into pain and harm, making it a product of fascination and anxiety in the desire to corroborate one's own narrative of victimization\-- you should be skeptical of the aff's rearrangement of power, it's merely a ventriloquist tactic that ultimately structurally adjusts and re-entrenches violence within its own liberal order.

**Abbas 10** (Asma, Bard College at Simon\'s Rock, Division of Social
Studies, "Liberalism and Human Suffering: Materialist Reflections on
Politics, Ethics, and Aesthetics"//CS)

[Conversations about suffering abound in what we may call the "official"
public sphere. Suffering is made present in a standard way: it is
domesticated into pain and harm, which become the central, overarching,
occluding motifs in our experience of our own and others' suffering and
in our relation and response to it]{.underline}. The usual locus of
ethical-political discourses that take suffering seriously is why and
how someone would be driven to cause harm, what history unleashes
suffering, and how we must respond to scenarios of human suffering that
defy human imagination. In all these, [the positions of the perpetrator
and the observer-respondent are often the coordinates within which the
victim is evidenced. In their focus on how to acknowledge, affirm, and
remove suffering]{.underline}, such conversations about victims and
their injuries (codified harms) have suffering and sufferers as the
object of diagnosis, prognosis, and remedy. [Debates feature questions
of whether, for whom, and for what to speak; who speaks for others; who
speaks for themselves; how to make space for people to speak for
themselves; whom to bid speak; whether or not we can know someone's
pain; and how to make them or their speech go away. These puzzles
revolve around, ironically, the agents qua respondents to someone's
suffering---the saviors, liberators, lip-readers, empowerers---whose
regard for others is fed by a fervor steeped in the unacknowledged
privilege of framing these conversations and puzzles and is subsequently
quite taxing to those who already suffer.]{.underline} Moreover, it is
striking and, at times, incredible how much these "agents" are the ones
most needy of reassurance and tending in forms ranging from, say, a
regular serving of abstract hope in the future of humanity, to relief
from guilt of their privilege, to conquest of the inscrutable, to
stability in the stock market after a tragedy somewhere else. It seems
that the [eager anxiety about the "perspective of the victims," whether
in hearing their voices, forcing them to speak, or speaking for them, is
indulged as long as it completes "my" knowledge, "my" picture, or "my"
sense of justice.]{.underline} This scenario accords consolatory
functions to sensuousness, speech, and representation not only, or even
primarily, for those who suffer and are the plaintiffs but also for
those in power when they demand that sufferers speak and act their
suffering in certain, prescribed ways. [There is no room here for the
vast space between the said and the unsaid, the enacted and the undone,
where those for whom speech is always a response persist]{.underline}.
For many, [even speaking for oneself is almost always a response whose
burden is never felt by those who always get to interrogate and
sympathize. This voice seemingly necessitated by suffering in turn
polices the modes of suffering and subjectivity
possible.]{.underline} [Harm and representation turn out to be
reciprocal as the haunted negotiations between liberalism and democracy
continue, rendering liberal democratic politics always in debt to
suffering]{.underline}. This voice does carry, shaping the experience
and the dominant aesthetic and political imaginations of people outside
liberal democracies, to the extent that such voice becomes an index of
their democratic desire insofar as those with the goods find it
familiar. These forced familiarities severely compromise the
fundamental [experience channeled in this performance that could lead to
different intimacies and alternative liberatory counter-discourses in
the face of such scripted and mimicked desire to begin
with.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Link - Hacking/Anarchy

#### 'Hacking the state' is an oxymoron. The state intentionally reasrches and tries to find out the strategies of radical organizations, to ensure that they never gain power. 

**Blas, 2014** {a.t. Blas, Zach. \"Informatic opacity.\" The Journal of
Aesthetics and Protest 9 (2014).}

On June 7, 2013, the [N]{.underline}ational [S]{.underline}ecurity
[A]{.underline}gency's [surveillance program was made
public]{.underline} in news media with the aid of whistleblower Edward
Snowden, journalist Glenn Greenwald, and filmmaker Laura Portrais. Their
reports revealed a suite of software designed for global, invasive data
searches and analysis, including PRISM, a data-mining application used
to collect billions of metadata records from various telecommunications
and social media companies, and Boundless Informant, a visualization
tool developed to track and analyze collected data; a third was
announced on July 31, 2013, as XKeyscore, a search system that mines
extensive online databases containing browsing histories and emails.
Just as philosopher Michel Foucault once described the panopticon as the
exemplary diagram of surveillance in the modern age, [this assemblage of
software, whose reach is yet to be fully known, will arguably become our
contemporary replacement.]{.underline} [Both the panopticon and NSA
software control through an optical logic of making
visible.]{.underline} While the panopticon employs the threat of
continuous visibility as a disciplinary means to achieve docile
conditioning, [the NSA implements technical platforms to produce
informatic visibilities on populations, which is the aggregation of data
for identifying, categorizing, and tracking. Here, visibility is light
as information]{.underline}. For instance, take PRISM: a prism mediates
and manages light, and as a transparent device, it suggests a mediation
that is invisible, elided, obscured. Through a seemingly
phantasmagorical process, a prism catches light from the world and
refracts and parses it, and PRISM's logo depicts this, as light rays are
intersected by a prism to exude a single rainbow with demarcated color
fields. Thus, a prism needs light to be functional, and the [light that
PRISM necessitates is information]{.underline} stored and in circulation
throughout global, digital networks, severs, and databases. Such light
is a particular, material form, based on standards that have been
predetermined by a multifarious conglomerate of corporate, military, and
state interests. To harness this light, digital, networked surveillance
relies upon the production of global technical standards, or protocols,
to account for human life, what media theorists Alexander R. Galloway
and Eugene Thacker label the "universal standards of identification."(1)
Technologies of identification like biometrics, GPS, and data-mining
algorithms require normalizing techniques for indexing human activity
and identity, which then operate as common templates for regulation,
management, and governance. It is through the utilization of such
standards that surveillance is able to rapidly increase at a global
scale. As a result, information theorist Philip Agre claims contemporary
surveillance must be more aptly termed "capture," a computational
process that signals to the often automated collection of information
that is analyzed against pre-established models.(2) [The construction of
these models\--]{.underline}or "grammars of action," as Agre describes
them\--[are designed by humans, and therefore, contain sociopolitical
tendencies and preferences]{.underline} within their very technical
architectures. [Informatic standardizations, in turn, produce a
conception of the human as that which is fully measurable, quantifiable,
and knowable\--that is, informatically visible\--an enterprise that
undoubtedly accelerates a neoliberal agenda where private security
companies get rich by vehemently surveilling the world
population.]{.underline} Our surveillance state now finds itself
preoccupied with big data, interactive biometric marketing, and the
domestication of tracking and measuring technologies, exemplified in the
Quantified Self movement. [Capture technologies and their global
standards of identification insidiously return us to the ableist,
classist, homophobic, racist, sexist, and transphobic scientific
endeavors of the 19th century, like anthropometry]{.underline},
physiognomy, and eugenics, [albeit with the speed and ubiquity of 21st
century digital technologies]{.underline}. [The reliance of
identification standardization in capture works to eliminate alterity,
in which alterity becomes what remains outside computational
possibilities of calculation and identification/privacy
categorization.]{.underline} Of course, the grammars, or standards, of
capture are technical forms of societal normalization, [which amount to
gross reductions in identification, where identity is reduced to
disembodied aggregates of data]{.underline}. Thus, it is minoritarian
persons that are rendered uncomputable because their difference, or
alterity, cannot be digitally measured. With biometrics, for example,
dark skin is commonly undetectable while other non-normative displays of
age, race, or gender are frequently mis-recognized. [It is those that
exist as such anomalies that are informatically invisible, not emitting
light, a precarious position to be sure, under threat of political
violence. But, not emitting light and becoming informatically opaque is
also a tactical practice of evasion, resistance, and autonomy that
struggles towards social change]{.underline}. Today, if [control and
policing dominantly operate through making bodies informatically
visible, then informatic opacity becomes a prized means of resistance
against the state and its identity politics. Such opaque actions
approach capture technologies as one instantiation of the vast uses of
representation and visibility to control and]{.underline} [oppress, and
therefore, refuse the false promises of equality, rights, and inclusion
offered by state representation and, alternately create radical exits
that open pathways to self-determination and autonomy]{.underline}. In
fact, a pervasive desire to flee visibility is casting a shadow across
political, intellectual, and artistic spheres; acts of escape and
opacity are everywhere today! For instance, [global masked
protest]{.underline}\--from Anonymous and black blocs to Pussy Riot and
the Zapatistas\--is a carnivalesque refusal of capture and recognition,
an aesthetic tool for collective transformation beyond the perceptual
registers of informatic and state visibility. Furthermore, the
cypherpunk has also grown in popularity, as projects like TOR and HTTPS
Everywhere develop encryption technologies that offer online anonymity.
Opaque practices expand upon critical theories like the whatever
singularity, imperceptibility, illegibility, nonexistence,
disappearance, and exodus. Yet, it is perhaps queer theory that has most
decidedly taken an opaque turn in recent years: concepts like Jose
Esteban Munoz's queerness as escape, Jack Halberstam's queer darkness,
and Nicholas de Villiers' queer opacity understand queerness as both a
refusal and utopic re-imagining of normalizing drives to recognize,
categorize, and visualize, while they continue to engage the power
dynamics of class, gender, race, and sexuality and their impact on the
categories of visible and invisible.(3) Informatic opacity might best be
understood as a mutated queerness, brought to a global, technical scale,
that strives to subvert identification standardization. Ultimately, it
is the late Martinique thinker Édouard Glissant's aesthetico-ethical
philosophy of opacity that is paradigmatic: his claim that "a person has
the right to be opaque" does not concern legislative rights but is
rather [an ontological position that lets exist as such that which is
immeasurable, nonidentifiable, and unintelligible in
things.(4]{.underline}) Glissant's opacity is an [ethical mandate to
maintain obscurity, to not impose rubrics of categorization and
measurement, which always enact a politics of reduction and
exclusion]{.underline}. While opacity in Glissant's writings is not
tactical, [an opaque tactics, now more than ever, must be wielded to
insist on opacity as a crucial ethics\--because capture annihilates
opacity]{.underline}. Between the antimonies of identification
standardization and opacity, a paradox emerges: as capture technologies
are intimately bound to the privileges of citizenship, mobility, and
rights, those who are either computationally illegible or unaccounted
for are excessively vulnerable to violence, discrimination, and
criminalization because, unlike the normatively monitored and
identified, they are always risks, in that [their opacity is not fully
controllable]{.underline}. As I stated previously, it is often
nonnormative, minoritarian persons that are forced to occupy such
precarious positions; just consider the struggles of transgender and
undocumented persons with identification regulatioqaqn. Thus, a paradox
of recognition presents itself: [political precarity is a result of
informatic opacity]{.underline}, but utopian desires persist nonetheless
in escaping the control of visibility and recognition, a battle that is
seemingly more and more impossible. The implausible proposition of
becoming informatically opaque does appear insurmountable. Indeed, it is
the subject of theorist Irving Goh's essay "Prolegomenon to a Right to
Disappear," in which he turns to artistic practice for how one might
proceed.(5) Similarly, in their hacktivist prophecy against capture,
Galloway and Thacker claim that "future avant-garde practices will be
those of nonexistence."(6) Here, opacity is an aesthetico-political
practice that enables revolt and envisions alternatives through
speculative proposition and practical experimentation. A burgeoning
group of contemporary artists have commenced such an opaque practice,
producing variations on how to become informatically opaque. In support
of Wikileaks, Dutch design and research group Metahaven fabricated a
series of scarves to evoke the organization's dual engagement with
opacity and transparency, as tactics of anonymity and encryption are
used to protect whistleblowers in order to make corruption transparent.
Like the protest mask, the scarf is an aesthetic accessory that blocks
capture but also generates visibilities opaque to control. Also working
in fashion, artist Adam Harvey develops [DIY "looks" for evading face
detection]{.underline}; in CV Dazzle, he uses make-up and hair styling
to construct eccentric designs that make faces unrecognizable to
computer vision systems. In workshops, Harvey teaches publics how to use
cosmetics and clothing to evade various detection systems. Similarly,
feminist artist Jemima Wyman, whose practice broadly explores fashion
and camouflage in protest, recently organized a sew-in and fundraiser to
make masks in solidarity with Pussy Riot. In my own artistic practice, I
lead an on-going series of mask workshops and actions called Facial
Weaponization Suite, in which collective masks are produced from the
aggregated biometric facial data of participants. The masks function as
both a practical evasion of biometric facial recognition and also a more
general refusal of political visibility, which intersects with
contemporary social movements' use of masking. My workshops are both
site-specific, designed to engage a particular community in a specific
place, and pedagogical, in that they educate publics on the often
technically and bureaucratically complex deployments of surveillance and
capture technologies. The project also offers people experiences in
being together masked, which is certainly training in opaque ethics The
first mask in the suite is Fag Face Mask, which is a critical engagement
with recent scientific studies that claim sexual orientation can be
determined through rapid facial recognition techniques. During
reclaim:pride, an intervention at the 2013 LA Pride in West Hollywood
with the ONE Archives and RECAPS Magazine, [the mask was used as part of
a Face Face Scanning Station to performatively critique mainstream gay
and lesbian politics' desire for inclusion and recognition by the
state]{.underline}. The second mask addresses a tripartite conception of
blackness, split between biometric racism (the inability to detect dark
skin), the favoring of black in militant aesthetics, and black as that
which informatically obfuscates. Organized in conjunction with Ricardo
Dominguez's b.a.n.g.lab at UCSD, participants staged tableau vivants to
dramatize these different yet overlapping shades of blackness. Such
artistic practices demonstrate that at their core is an aesthetics that
demands a different approach to looking, recognizing, and identifying,
that confounds a standardized visibility structured by quantification,
measurement, and reduction. These are withdraws from power through
collective stylings but also occupations of zones that lie outside the
perceptual registers of control. [Informatic opacity, then, is not about
simply being unseen, disappearing, or invisible, but rather about
creating autonomous visibilities, which are trainings in difference and
transformation]{.underline}. While such practices might remain utopic
speculations or small-scale realizations, [art makes the impossibility
of informatic opacity feasible,]{.underline} [practical, and fantastic,
and its aesthetics omit something other than light that collectivizes
and builds solidarity.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Link - Queer Visibility

#### Discorses about queer people "living their truth" not only shame people who are in the closet as those who are "lying" but also buy into a narrative of who a good queer and who is a bad queer- effectualty Otherizing them 

**Bow, 2001**a.tBonnie Dow (2001) *Ellen*, Television, and the Politics
of Gay and Lesbian Visibility, Critical Studies in Media
Communication, 18:2, 123-140, DOI: [[10.1080/07393180128077]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1080/07393180128077)

It is perhaps arguable how widely shared the opinion is that Ellen
DeGeneres's poster child status is about honesty rather than lesbianism,
but the assertion that DeGeneres's coming-out narrative, in both its
''real'' and fictionalized forms, has had a profound effect on public
discourse, can hardly be questioned (although, as I argue here, the
dimensions of that effect are open to question). [DeGeneres's public
announcement of her homosexuality made the cover of Time magazine
(]{.underline}Handy, 1997b), [got her an invitation to the White
House]{.underline} (''Girls Night Out,'' 1997), and provoked laudatory
comments from Vice-President Al Gore about Hollywood's new openness
toward sexual orientation (Price, 1997). DeGeneres's ascendance as
1997's lesbian media icon was, of course, triggered by the ABC sitcom
Ellen, which broadcast three episodes, beginning on April 30, 1997,
concerning the ''coming-out'' experiences of its lead character, Ellen
Morgan. Prior to the first coming-out episode, DeGeneres, the star of
and creative force behind the sitcom, was featured in a media blitz of
interviews in three high-profile make for a: Time magazine, 20/20, and
Oprah, in which she discussed her own struggles with her sexuality, her
romantic relationships with women, and the process of creating the Ellen
episodes. [The generally positive response to the coming-out episodes
and DeGeneres's sudden media popularity seemed to indicate that
previously censored forms of sexuality were gliding rather easily out of
the closet and into prime-time]{.underline}. By the spring of 1998,
however, this triumphal narrative had taken another turn. After a season
of lackluster ratings, ABC canceled the sitcom. There were accusations
from DeGeneres that the network had not been supportive of the show,
claims from ABC executives that the program had turned into her personal
soapbox, and arguments from television critics and commentators that it
had simply ceased to be funny (Cagle, 1998; Gilbert, 1998; Tucker,
1998). Even amid the rancor, there was agreement from both sides that
Ellen had changed the face of television, and a syndication deal with
the Lifetime network meant that Ellen would live on in re-runs. Indeed,
several critics have argued that the success of the NBC sitcom Will and
Grace, which debuted in the fall of 1998 and focuses on two roommates, a
heterosexual woman and a gay man, was made possible by the path that
Ellen blazed (Hall, 1998; Milvy, 1998; Mink, 1998).1 Moreover, in
February of 1999, the coming-out of a male character on the WB teen soap
Dawson's Creek, and the revelation that the show's creator, Kevin
Williamson, was gay, caused ''barely a ripple'' in public discourse
(Bauder, 1999, p. 7c; see also Connelly, 1999). Whether or not Ellen
did, in fact, make it ''okay to be gay,'' is not the primary concern
here, although this analysis may make some gestures toward answering
that question. Rather, [I am concerned with the narrative logic of the
coming-out discourses in and around the three Ellen
episodes]{.underline} in the spring of 1997. As a case study, the [Ellen
coming-out sheds light on the various mechanisms through which the
ostensible liberation of the truth of sexuality---from silence,
repression, denial---was not a simple case of setting free the truth,
but was, rather, the beginning of a discursive construction of that
sexuality---of its authenticity, of its form, and of its politics. This
construction, from its beginning, was ''thoroughly imbued with relations
of power'']{.underline} (Foucault, 1978, p. 60) [that channeled its
rhetorical effect in particular directions and that present implications
for our understanding of what gay visibility can and cannot be allowed
to mean in commercial media]{.underline}.

**Outing affirmation is a type of queer authenticity testing**

**Bow, 2001 (**a.tBonnie Dow (2001) *Ellen*, Television, and the
Politics of Gay and Lesbian Visibility, Critical Studies in Media
Communication, 18:2, 123-140, DOI: [[10.1080/07393180128077](https://doi.org/10.1080/07393180128077))]{.underline}

Confession, Liberation, Authenticity In his explanation of the
repressive hypothesis, Foucault argues that, [contrary to the belief
that the late twentieth century gave rise to ever expanding levels of
openness about sexuality, discourse about sex has been proliferating at
an excessive rate since the late nineteenth century]{.underline} (1978,
pp. 63--65). [Confession, originally in the form of penance, but later
in a wide variety of forms and within a wide variety of relationships,
''was, and still remains, the general standard for governing the
production of the true discourse on]{.underline} sex'' (Foucault, 1978,
p. 63). Importantly, the attraction of confession has, in large part,
been linked to a belief in its liberating effect, what Foucault calls
''the internal ruse of confession'': t[he assumption that ''confessions
frees, but power reduces one to silence; truth does not belong to an
order of power, but shares an original affinity with
freedom'']{.underline} (p. 60). The implicit notion that ''[the truth is
corroborated by the obstacles and resistance it has had to surmount in
order to be formulated,'' and that ''the expression alone, independently
of its external consequences, produces intrinsic modifications in the
persona who articulates it'' is precisely the logic that governs the
coming-out discourse]{.underline} in and around Ellen. That [confession,
for the confessor, ''exonerates, redeems, and purifies . . . unburdens
him \[or her\] of his \[or her\] wrongs, liberates him \[or her\], and
promises him \[or her\] salvation]{.underline},'' is a key theme in the
language of both Ellen DeGeneres and Ellen Morgan (Foucault, 1978, p.
62). The April 14, 1997, issue of Time magazine featured DeGeneres on
its cover in a simple portrait over the words ''Yep, She's Gay.'' The
Time story was DeGeneres's first act of coming out in the mainstream
media, and it is the first instance in the pattern that would emerge.
The article describes her coming out as ''the culmination of a long
process of struggling with feelings about her own sexuality, her fears
about being rejected for it, her wish to lead a more honest and open
life in public, her weariness at the effort it took her not to'' (Handy,
1997b, p. 78). DeGeneres is quoted within the article saying, ''this has
been the most freeing experience because people can't hurt me anymore''
(Handy, 1997b, p. 78). The interview with DeGeneres on ABC's 20/20, her
next major media appearance, began with Diane Sawyer's noting of the
''risk'' entailed in ''deciding to go public with a lifelong secret.''
DeGeneres herself makes reference to not living her life as a lie
anymore, refusing to be ashamed any longer, and the ''joy'' that coming
out gave her. However, the Oprah interview that aired shortly before the
coming-out episode was broadcast is perhaps the richest example of the
liberation narrative that threaded through DeGeneres's media discourse.
Importantly, Oprah Winfrey's facilitation of DeGeneres's revelations on
daytime television had additional intertextual power as it was noted
during the interview that Winfrey herself had a cameo in the first
coming-out episode. She played Ellen Morgan's therapist, who aids Ellen
in reaching the realization that she is gay, much as Winfrey herself
aids DeGeneres in discussing her sexuality on Oprah. Very early in the
interview, Winfrey asks DeGeneres, ''Now that you have come out, what
has been the biggest relief for you?'' and DeGeneres replies in the same
terms she has elsewhere, describing her confession as a kind of freedom:
''To feel completely honest---that's something I've never felt in my
life, and I don't know how many people do feel like that. And this is
not a gay issue, this is just an issue about truth and about not having
anything to hide. No one can hurt me.'' Within the first Ellen episode,
as Ellen Morgan is talking with Oprah in character as her therapist, she
says something remarkable similar: ''I feel like this tremendous weight
has been lifted off of me. I mean, for the first time in my life I feel
comfortable with myself.'' DeGeneres's public confession of her
sexuality was saturated with implications of authenticity at different
levels. [First and most clearly, her revelations were couched in terms
of her personal discovery or recovery of authenticity; she was revealing
her ''true'' self to the public]{.underline}. As Joan Scott notes,
''What could be truer, after all, than a subject's own account of what
he or she has lived through?'' (1993, p. 399). Second, these initial
revelations occurred in a prominent print news magazine, a prominent
television news magazine, both high status non-fiction fora, as well as
in a highly rated daytime television talk show well known for its use of
intimate confession as a path to personal authenticity (Fiske, 1987, pp.
281--282; Davis, 1999). Despite their status differences, all three of
these media contexts share [a common methodological and epistemological
premise that Scott identifies in historical writing: the ''authority of
experience'' arises from and contributes to its function as a
''reflection of the real'']{.underline} (1993, p. 399). Thus,
DeGeneres's testimony, coupled with the contexts in which it appears,
constructs an authenticity narrative that privileges what Scott calls
''the evidence of experience.'' This [epistemological framework, whether
conceived through a metaphor of visibility or any other way that takes
meaning as transparent, reproduces rather than contests given
ideological systems---those that assume that the facts of history speak
for themselves and those that rest on a naturally established opposition
between, say, sexual practice and social conventions, or between
homosexuality and heterosexuality.]{.underline} (1993, p. 400)
Crucially, the authenticity narrative established by DeGeneres's
comingout in non-fiction media appearances carries over to the
coming-out episodes of Ellen. Not only does the program gain credibility
for its representation from the intertextual links with DeGeneres's
personal testimony and its interpretation in other venues, but, in many
ways, the struggle for the truth and the eventual triumph of
authenticity and honesty that DeGeneres described or alluded to in
interviews was enacted within the Ellen episodes. For example, in the
climactic moment in the first coming-out episode, when Ellen first
confesses her sexuality to a woman to whom she is attracted, the
struggle is clear in the speech pattern itself: I can't even say the
word. Why can't I say the word? I mean, why can't I just say . . . I
mean, what is wrong . . . Why do I have to be so ashamed? I mean why
can't I just say the truth, I mean be who I am. I'm thirtyfive years
old. I'm so afraid to tell people, I mean I just . . . Susan, I'm gay.
Almost immediately, the liberating effects take hold, as Ellen says,
''That felt great, that felt so great.'' In the second episode, as
Ellen's mother laments that she misses ''the old Ellen,'' Ellen replies
in terms that stress the authenticity that the ''new'' Ellen has gained:
''Which Ellen is that? The Ellen that used to keep her feelings bottled
up? The Ellen that used to lie to herself and everybody else? The Ellen
that could have spent the rest of her life alone?'' The temporal and
thematic convergence of the confessions of Ellen DeGeneres and Ellen
Morgan is key to understanding the significance of the repressive
hypothesis. In the Ellen discourse. In both cases, the confession is
represented as changing Ellen by allowing her authentic self to emerge,
because such a deep truth '' 'demands' only to surface . . . and it can
finally be articulated only at the price of a kind of liberation''
(Foucault, 1978, p. 60). This is an implication articulated repeatedly
in coming-out narratives, what Bonnie Zimmerman (1985) calls the ''
'tribal' lore,'' and the ''myth of origins'' of the lesbian community
(p. 262). Zimmerman's study of literary coming-out narratives analyzes
the liberatory function of such discourse, in which ''speaking,
especially naming oneself 'lesbian,' is an act of empowerment. [Power,
which traditionally is the essence of politics, is connected with the
ability to name, to speak, to come out of silence\.... Powerlessness, on
the other hand, is associated with silence and the 'speechlessness' that
the powerful impose on those dispossessed of language'' (p. 259). The
notion of power at work in this description is one that assumes ''a
world of discourse divided between accepted discourse and excluded
discourse, or between the dominant discourse and the dominated one''
(Foucault, 1978, p. 100); it is, in short, the world assumed by the
repressive hypothesis, one in which the evidence of experience is
transparent and its liberating effect is assured]{.underline}. For the
literary coming-out narratives Zimmerman speaks of, the audience is
clear: they are addressed to ''a reading community assumed to be (or to
have the potential to be) lesbian'' (Martin, 1993, p. 278). The politics
of such narratives, then, are connected to ''self-worth, identity, and a
sense of community,'' and coming out ''aims to give lesbian identity a
coherence and a legitimacy that can make both individual and social
action possible'' (Martin, 1993, p. 278). Following Foucault, Biddy
Martin (1993) questions the wisdom of rooting political liberation in
the ''autonomy of the psychological'' arguing that the [repressive
hypothesis works to ''mask the actual workings of power'']{.underline}
(p. 276). Indeed, this caution is even more necessary when considering
the function of the DeGeneres/ Morgan coming-out in mass media, a
context in which [a supportive or identifying audience can hardly be
assumed.]{.underline} Lost in the narrative of authenticity and
liberation that permeates comingout stories is, of course, Foucault's
claim that to enter the confession ritual may be seemingly to escape
from one power relation only to enter another. As LaFountain (1989)
explains, [''the whole truth does not rely in the confessor but rather
is 'incomplete, blind to itself' and only reaches completion in the one
who assimilates and records it.'']{.underline} This process''aligns the
interpreter with knowledge and truth, and with power. It is to and for
power that we are confessing animals.'' (p. 132)

#### Clamoring for queer inclusion only puts the focus on heterosexual populations- framing the conversation about how they need to accept us, liberate us. This also allows heterosexual folk to get away with the structural forms of oppression; instead of talking how heterosexual people can mitigate the ways that they contribute to inequality, the conversation becomes 'which queer actor can we put on TV'?

**Bow, 2001**a.tBonnie Dow (2001) *Ellen*, Television, and the Politics
of Gay and Lesbian Visibility, Critical Studies in Media

Certainly, DeGeneres and Ellen brought some visibility to an important
issue: the representation of gays and lesbians in mainstream media.
Certainly, a lead character that is lesbian is a step beyond what we
have seen before. In crucial ways, however, Ellen departed little from
representational norms. [The underlying similarity of the rules of gay
and lesbian representation discussed above is that they all contribute
to the conclusion that homosexuality is relevant almost exclusively for
its impact on personal relationships]{.underline}, and moreover, that
the most important personal relationships [a gay or lesbian character
has are those s/he has with heterosexuals]{.underline}. Stock storylines
have included the coming-out narrative (and its effect on spouses,
parents, children), the narrative about acceptance of a gay partner, or,
increasingly, the ways that family and friends cope with AIDS. In many
cases, such storylines include [allusions to larger
political]{.underline} or legal [issues that affect gays and lesbians,
but such issues are alluded to primarily for their utility in prompting
interpersonal confrontation, reconciliation, or solidarity]{.underline}.
Typically, this kind of plot device results in the moment when the
homophobic friend or family member realizes that to hate gays is to hate
someone that he or she loves and is instantly transformed as a result.
[It is the moment when political oppression becomes a personal problem,
and the solution to that problem is largely in the hands of
heterosexuals. Thus, even when confronting the supposed subversion of
heterosexuality, heterosexism governs Ellen's representation as well as
the production of the ''truth'' of her sexuality: what it will and will
not mean, how it does and does not matter.]{.underline} There is a
moment in the second coming-out episode of Ellen that exemplifies this
process quite well. In this episode, Ellen comes out to her parents, who
are, predictably, shocked and dismayed. Ellen's father has a
particularly hard time with her lesbian identity. Although her mother,
Lois, is convinced to attend a meeting of PFLAG (Parents and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays), she informs Ellen that Ellen's father refused to
come. During the meeting, another parent attacks Ellen, saying ''Why
should your mother accept this \[your lesbianism\]? It's wrong. It's
sick. And you're sick.'' Ellen's mother jumps to her defense, saying
''Don't you talk to my daughter that way. . . . Sure, I'm not happy
about this. But I love her and I don't want to lose her.'' At that
moment, Ellen's father arrives unexpectedly and joins in, ''You tell 'em
Lois. She's here, she's queer, get used to it!'' The man who attacks
Ellen represents the kind of bigotry that she is likely to face as a
lesbian. However, the point of this moment is not to draw attention to
that fact of lesbian existence; rather, it is to showcase the triumph of
Ellen's parents' love for her over their disappointment. Even though
Ellen's father recites a slogan popular with queer political activists,
it is also clear that he has little idea what it means, as he notes in
an aside to Ellen that he read it on a bumper sticker. Moments earlier
in this scene, Ellen's mother Lois specifically raised the issue of
discrimination, albeit obliquely, by saying that she was concerned for
Ellen because ''Life is going to be so hard for you now.'' The immediate
reply from the PFLAG counselor was ''[It's harder to live a lie than it
is to live your life openly and honestly,'' neatly sidestepping the very
real issue of discrimination and turning the issue into one of personal
integrity]{.underline}. The treatment of Ellen's homosexuality in the
coming-out episodes operates repeatedly to emphasize personal issues
over political ones; that is, it [presents acceptance by family and
friends as the most crucial issues Ellen faces]{.underline}. The first
episode in the series of three treated Ellen's recognition of her
attraction to women, her difficulties coming out to her friends, and her
first encounter with lesbian culture (a trip to a lesbian coffeehouse).
The second focused on her coming out to her parents, and the third
centered on the conflicts engendered by her sexuality with her best
(heterosexual) woman friend and with her boss at the bookstore where she
is a manager. The majority of the problems treated in these episodes are
standard sitcom fare solved in standard sitcom style---fear and
ignorance are conquered through love, support, and mutual understanding.
In all of these episodes, the sitcom follows the basic rules of gay and
lesbian representation: no sexual interaction, treating Ellen's
revelation as a ''problem'' to be dealt with by her heterosexual friends
and family, and minuscule representation of any sort of lesbian
community---indeed, it is quite amusing that in the first episode of the
1997 fall season, Ellen's best heterosexual friend bemoans the fact that
Ellen is not ''clicking'' with any of the women she fixes her up with,
and she says, ''I'm running out of lesbians.'' Apparently the
heterosexuals in her life know more lesbians than Ellen does. In terms
of its subversion of television's patterns of representation of
homosexuality, the biggest contribution that Ellen makes is taking us
beyond the ''one shot'' or ''one episode'' approach. When larger issues
related to the political status of gays and lesbians are raised in
Ellen, they are turned into jokes or transformed into personal identity
or relationship issues. At a few points in these episodes, the
possibility of larger ramifications appears. For example, in the first
episode, during a conversation with her therapist, Ellen mentions
discrimination against gays and lesbians, but her only specific example
is ''Do you think I want people calling me names to my face?'' Amused by
Ellen's attempt to explain discrimination to a black woman, her
therapist (played by Oprah Winfrey) sarcastically replies, ''To have
people commit hate crimes against you just because you're not like them?
. . . To have to use separate bathrooms and separate water fountains?
Sit in the back of the bus?'' Ellen, finally seeing the irony,
humorously replies, ''Oh, man, we have to use separate water
fountains?'' The point of this interaction seems to be to belittle
Ellen's fears, or, perhaps, to draw a parallel between prejudice against
African-Americans prejudice against gays and lesbians. However, the
point that is not made in this scene is that the kinds of discrimination
that were once legal against African Americans are still legal, in most
states, against gays and lesbians. There is no federal civil rights law
protecting the rights of gays and lesbians. Unlike African-Americans,
they have not yet been designated a protected class. In 39 states, it is
legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians in employment. However,
Ellen assiduously avoids such recognition; indeed, at the end of her
interaction with her therapist, Ellen Morgan turns the issue of
discrimination back into one of self-acceptance when she says, ''You
have to admit it's not exactly an accepted thing. I mean, you never see
a cake that says 'Good for you---you're gay.' '' Continuing the personal
turn, the therapist replies, ''Okay, then, Ellen, I'll say it: 'Good for
you, you're gay' '' (my emphasis). This [neat turning of the potentially
political into the personal]{.underline} becomes a pattern in the
coming-out episodes. In the third such episode, Ellen faces the
possibility of workplace discrimination, when her boss at the bookstore
she manages reacts negatively to the knowledge that she is a lesbian.
Importantly, however, his first reaction is not to fire her, which would
take the issue into the realm of politics by introducing employment
discrimination. Rather, her boss's reaction is manifested in personal
terms, as he tells her that he no longer wants her to baby-sit his
children, with whom she has a close relationship. When Ellen presses him
for an explanation, his response is that he thinks homosexuality is
wrong and that he is ''just protecting my kids.'' When Ellen asks him if
he sees her as ''someone so evil that you've got to keep your children
away from me?'' he replies that he has to do what he thinks is right. At
this point, Ellen quits her job saying that she cannot work with someone
who feels this way about her. Ellen is not fired, a move that would be
legal in many states; rather, she makes the decision to quit, turning
the issue (again) into one of her own personal integrity. Moreover, it
is obvious that she is most disturbed by the breakdown of her
relationship with her boss and his family rather than by the effect of
his homophobia on her workplace environment. In the coming-out episodes,
Ellen simply refuses to recognize the existence of organized, systemic,
or politically oppressive homophobia, and the political status of gays
and lesbians is never raised. When this issue finally surfaces, it is in
a fall 1997 episode that appears designed to critique the oppressive
nature of gay and lesbian political activism, rather than the political
oppression to which such activism responds. In this episode, Ellen's gay
friend Peter (a recurring character) invites several of his gay and
lesbian friends to a party at Ellen's house, in an effort to introduce
her to the gay and lesbian community. Again, politics are played for
laughs, as Ellen reacts to meeting a rather militant, politically aware
lesbian. The woman hands Ellen a rainbow flag, explaining that ''The
rainbow is a sign of unity for gays of all sexes, creeds, and colors.''
Ellen instantly repudiates this political implication, responding that
''Well, it's also a sign that it's raining and the sun is still
shining.'' Later in the party, Ellen offers this same woman some ''Sen˜
or Crunchy'' corn chips, and is refused with the comment that the woman
is ''boycotting---excuse me---girlcotting. Sen˜ or Crunchy's has
repeatedly denied benefits to same sex partners.'' At a loss for words,
Ellen replies, ''But they're corndelicous.'' Moments later, Ellen uses
the word ''straight'' and receives an instant lecture: ''You really
shouldn't use the word straight---it implies that gay people are somehow
crooked, or bent.'' Ellen's cutting response makes it clear that the
appropriate reaction to this woman is to dismiss her as humorless and
rigid: ''Well, what about the word gay? I mean, that's a lot of
pressure, to be happy and cheerful all the time. Although I see it
didn't touch you at all.'' The woman does not give up on her relentless
pressure to politicize Ellen, proposing ''a toast to our new sister
Ellen. We hope she will remember, as John Kennedy might have said, had
he been gay, 'ask not what the gay community can do for you, ask what
you can do for the gay community.' '' Incredibly, at the same time that
it dismisses the possibility or relevance of the material effects of
homophobia, Ellen takes pains to establish gay political awareness and
activism as oppressive. Indeed, at the end of this episode, the pressure
toward political awareness is constructed as a threat to Ellen's
newfound authenticity as she discusses the evening with her friend
Peter. Ellen: I don't want people to think that I don't support the
community. I do, but I can't keep up---it's overwhelming. I can't keep
up with the bumper stickers and the flags and the gay bakeries and the
lesbian friendly furniture polish . . . I came out so I could be who I
am. I'm not about to change so I can please other people. Peter: Ellen,
the only reason I've been bugging you to get more involved is because I
wanted you to know that there's a whole support system out there of
people just like you. The person you are is wonderful . . . And the good
news is that you can be any kind of gay person you want to be. What is
most interesting about this is Ellen's claim that she does not wish to
change just because she has come out---[as if, again, coming out is a
purely personal phenomenon that is relevant only in terms of who she
decides to date or sleep with and has no impact on her status in the
larger world. Her liberation has been so complete that homophobia is no
factor at all. Even more interesting, Peter's reply to her complaint is
that the primary function of his community is to offer Ellen personal
support in her quest to be whatever kind of gay person she ''wants to
be.'' T]{.underline}he logic of the coming-out episodes, and one which
DeGeneres herself explicitly endorses, is that ''being gay is okay,''
and that gays and lesbian need to accept and value themselves and to
expect the same from their loved ones. DeGeneres' appearances on talk
shows and her interviews in the print media have underscored this
message again and again. The episode of PrimeTime Live that immediately
followed the broadcast of the first coming-out episode was introduced as
''a gay daughter and her anxious parents. One family's story,'' and
centered on DeGeneres's relationship with her family, as her mother,
father, and brother all discussed their reaction to her comingout.
Ellen's discourse, DeGeneres's discourse, and the media discourse that
accompanied them all constructed the [DeGeneres/Morgan coming out as a
personal phenomenon for whom the appropriate audience was her
heterosexual friends, family, and fans.]{.underline} At times, DeGeneres
brought up her hope that her show would have some impact on gay
teenagers and adolecents. A 1992 study of gay and lesbians youths, for
instance, found that 64% of males and 50% of females said that their
self-esteem was affected positively by coming out. Lesbian and gay
youths are two to three times more likely to attempt suicide than their
heterosexual peers, and gays and lesbians account for 30% of all
completed suicides among youths (Singer & Deschamps, 1994, pp. 76--77).
If a show like Ellen can alter those statistics in a positive way, it
deserves praise. [Self-acceptance and acceptance by friends and family
is important, particularly so in the process of coming-out. However it
is not the entire battle,]{.underline} and to talk about Ellen as though
it signifies some kind of achievement of equality for gays and lesbians,
either in media or in life, is to ''confuse autobiographical gestures
with \[political\] liberation'' (Martin, 1993, p. 276). Indeed,
proclaiming that ''Black is beautiful'' hardly ended racial
discrimination. As Biddy Martin has argued, the clear implication of
Foucault's argument about confession is that ''[laying claim, then, to
one's sexuality and the rights associated with it, insisting on the
freedom to speak freely of one's sexuality, risks subjection to
regulation and control'']{.underline} (1993, p. 276). Ellen demonstrates
this most clearly in its adherence to the norms for gay and lesbian
representation on television. Equally important, however, is the
realization that it is not sexuality that has been repressed in
television, but, rather, the politics of sexuality. Or, to put it
another way, [the secret being kept isn't homosexuality; it's homophobia
and heterosexism (Crimp, 1993, p. 308). In this sense, Ellen only
amplifies the silence, demonstrating the powerful mechanisms of power
and control at work in mediated discourse about gays and
lesbians]{.underline}.

#### Representation and visbility will never lead to emancipation for queer folks- they keep the levers of power strictly in the hands of cishet people, and make them the authority on whether or not we are okay to live**.**

Acknowledged or not, then, the confession ritual demands an audience,
for [''one does not confess without the presence (or virtual presence)
of a partner'']{.underline} (Foucault 1978, p. 61). Indeed, given
DeGeneres's public statements, the presence of the audience was foremost
in her mind. Explaining her reservations about coming out in her 20/20
interview, she noted her fear that ''if they found out I was gay, maybe
they wouldn't applaud, maybe they wouldn't laugh, maybe they wouldn't
like me if they knew that I was gay.'' ''They'' presumably refers to
Ellen's assumed heterosexual audience, as it seems logical to assume
that the gay community, to whom DeGeneres was hardly closeted anyway,
would hardly condemn her for coming out. Thus, the discourse of the
Ellen coming-out episodes can most usefully be read as a demonstration
that the most powerful implied audience for Ellen's revela127 CSMC DOW

2012 tions was, in fact, heterosexual. [With that in mind, the episodes'
discourse must be seen in relation to the logics of control and
depoliticization that historically have governed gay representation on
television and that governed Ellen as well. For Ellen, the implied
confessional partner, the ''authority who requires the confession,
prescribes and appreciates it, and intervenes in order to judge, punish,
forgive, console, and reconcile,'' was always heterosexual, both inside
the show's narrative and outside, in its viewing audience.]{.underline}
Thus, from the first moment, DeGeneres's/Morgan's [ostensibly liberating
move from silence into speech ''unfold\[ed\] within a power
relationship'' (Foucault, 1978, p. 61) that, within the Ellen discourse,
was simultaneously implicitly observed and explicitly
denied]{.underline}. Seen through both DeGeneres's discourse and media
treatments of it, the coming-out campaign was clearly geared toward
gaining the approval of mainstream, heterosexual Americans--- the kind
of people that ABC wants to watch its sitcoms, for instance. [For
example, DeGeneres came out to Time magazin]{.underline}e, rather than,
say, Out, the most widely read gay newsmagazine, or Curve, a popular
lesbian publication. In the Time article, DeGeneres took pains to insist
that she ''didn't do it to make a political statement,'' but merely
because ''it was a great thing for the show,'' and that she saw the
point of what she was doing as ''acceptance of everybody's differences''
(Handy, 1997a, p. 86). Interpreted within this frame, the
DeGeneres/Morgan revelations were touted by mainstream media as evidence
of progress: in (always presumed to be heterosexual) Americans'
tolerance for representation of homosexuality, in network television's
willingness to break the sexuality barrier by broadcasting a sitcom with
a gay lead character, in Hollywood's embrace of an openly gay actress.
[The notion that representation of a lesbian on prime time signaled a
kind of acceptance of homosexuality]{.underline} was explicitly stated
in the Time article discussing the show itself. As Bruce Handy (1997b)
put it, ''Does Ellen Morgan's coming out in what is still our massest
medium legitimize homosexuality, or does the sponsorship of a
bottom-line business like ABC merely reflect its acceptance by a
significant portion of the population? Clearly, the answer is both'' (p.
78). Generally, [the reception of the coming-out episodes was framed as
a referendum on prejudice against gays and lesbians; as]{.underline} a
comment in People magazine put it, ''Advertisers, networks, producers
and fans have to haul out their prejudices and say, 'Does this make a
difference in how I feel about this woman?' '' (Gliatto, et al., 1997,
p. 129). Frank Rich (1997, p. A29), writing in The New York Times,
phrased a similar question before the coming-out episode aired: ''If
\[the show\] fails, will the character's homosexuality, rather than the
series' spotty quality, be held accountable?'' Through the end of the
1997 season, at least, the approval of these various constituencies
named by commentators seemed clear. The coming-out episode more than
doubled Ellen's regular viewing audience, the show was renewed by ABC,
and Ellen garnered an Emmy for best comedy writing. On the other hand,
[saying that the success of Ellen's initial coming out means the end of
prejudice against gays and lesbians is like saying that the success of
The Cosby Show in the 1980s signaled the end of racism]{.underline} (
Jackson, 1997). There 128 ELLEN, TELEVISION JUNE 2001

2012 is, however, a useful parallel to be drawn between Ellen and Cosby,
which is that just as Cosby was often interpreted as a sitcom about
black people that was largely geared toward the comfort of white people
(see, e.g., Gray, 1994), [Ellen was a sitcom about a lesbian that was
largely geared toward the comfort of heterosexual]{.underline}s.2 In
this sense, it differs little from the history of representations of
gays and lesbians on television[. As Foucault has noted about sexuality
in general, the history of sexuality in prime-time television is not one
of absence and repression, but, rather, one that has followed clear
norms for different kinds of silence and speech. Representations of
homosexuality have existed since television's earliest
days,]{.underline} although, of course, in limited number. A drag queen
routine was one of the favorite and most popular items in the repertoire
of Milton Berle, one of early television's most popular comedians, and
there were powerful gay undertones in the comic relationships of Jack
Benny on The Jack Benny Show (Doty, 1993). The counterpart in 1950s
dramas was to cast homosexual characters, largely, male, as villains. In
this context, homosexuality was used primarily to establish an
additional level of deviance for such characters. The link of
homosexuality with criminality was a dramatic convention that continued
for decades, surfacing in series dramas such as Police Woman, Marcus
Welby, Hunter, and Midnight Caller in the 1970s and 1980s (see Fejes &
Petrich, 1993; Gross, 1994). With the growth of the gay rights movement
in the 1970s and resultant pressure for more positive representations,
television networks began to view homosexuality as an appropriate topic
for ''socially relevant'' programming; that is, programming designed to
sensitively treat the ''problem'' of homosexuality. This motive resulted
in television movies such as 1972's That Certain Summer, in which a gay
man must tell his son about his homosexuality, 1978's A Question of
Love, in which a lesbian mother fights for custody of her son, 1985's An
Early Frost, the first TV movie about AIDS, which focuses on a young man
who must reveal both his illness and his homosexuality to his family,
and 1992's Doing Time on Maple Drive, in which a college student comes
out to his very traditional (and dysfunctional) family. These TV movies
relied on the general rules for representing homosexuality on television
that were also evident in the sympathetic portrayals of gays and
lesbians that emerged in series television in the 1970s and 1980s in
shows such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, Barney Miller, Cheers,
Kate and Allie, The Golden Girls, or Designing Women. These rules
include the following: First, representations of gays and lesbians were
incorporated as ''one time'' appearances rather than as integral
elements or regular characters in a series narrative (This is why the
''one shot'' TV movie was such a popular form for dealing with
homosexuality). Second, [such characters are never ''incidentally'' gay;
they appeared in episodes or movies in which their sexuality was ''the
problem'' to be solved; third]{.underline}, the problem they represent
is depicted largely in terms of its effect on heterosexuals. [Homosexual
characters are rarely shown in their own communities, homes, or same-sex
romantic relationships but are depicted in terms of their place in the
lives of heterosexuals.]{.underline} Finally, and perhaps most crucially
for a commercial medium like television, representations of gay or
lesbian sex, or even desire, are absent (Fejes & Petrich, 1993). The
1990s witnessed the subversion of some of these rules as recurring gay
or lesbian characters were incorporated into both comedy and drama,
although, as has historically been true of all marginalized groups, the
preponderance of these representations occurred in comedy (Marc, 1989;
Taylor, 1989). There were a few exceptions beginning in the 1980s.
Dynasty, one of the most popular prime-time soaps of the 1980s,
contained a storyline about a bisexual male character who had a
difficult time deciding between men and women, much to the consternation
of his father, the family patriarch. Another 1980s drama, the
short-lived medical show Heartbeat, has received some critical attention
for its depiction of a recurring lesbian character who worked as a nurse
in a women's health clinic run by feminist doctors (Hantzis & Lehr,
1994; Moritz, 1994; Torres, 1993). However, the drama only lasted one
season, and the lesbian character's sexuality was featured in only two
episodes. Those few prime-time representations of gays or lesbians that
have taken the risk of depicting actual gay and lesbian sexual
interaction, however brief and avowedly ''tasteful,'' have predictably
run afoul of sponsors and conservative interest groups, all of which
claim to be representing the interests of the American (presumably
heterosexual) public. For example, a 1989 episode of the yuppie drama
thirtysomething featured a brief scene of two gay men in bed together.
The scene prompted advertisers to pull their sponsorship of the show,
and, although the episode was still aired, it was removed from the
summer rerun schedule (Fejes & Petrich, 1993, p. 413). A 1991 episode of
L.A. Law featured a brief kiss between two regular characters--- one of
whom was bisexual and the other of whom was presumably heterosexual but
was nonetheless intrigued. The Reverend Donald Wildmon's American Family
Association brought its wrath to bear on NBC, threatening product
boycotts (as it had done with Heartbeat), and NBC responded by
disclaiming any attempt to create a continuing lesbian storyline (Gross,
1994, p. 151). Indeed, by the end of the season, the intrigued woman was
recommitted to her heterosexuality, and the bisexual woman was happily
involved with a man---with whom, of course, she was shown having sex. In
the early 1990s, Roseanne added a regular bisexual female character. The
most famous moment in this storyline, however, came when Roseanne
herself, in a visit to a lesbian bar, briefly kissed another woman. The
episode in which this occurred was preceded by a ''viewer discretion''
warning from ABC (Roush, 1994). In 1997--98, the television season
following Ellen's coming out, recurring gay or lesbian characters were
featured on Spin City, Friends, ER, NYPD Blue, and Chicago Hope, just to
name a few popular shows. Indeed, when DeGeneres appeared on Oprah, a
young heterosexual mother in the audience claimed that the abundance of
such characters had become overwhelming and that media attention to gay
and lesbian sexuality was crowding out traditional family values. As
DeGeneres gently pointed out, we are a long way from such a situation.
However, the immense attention given to Ellen Morgan's coming out has
been interpreted as indicating a genuine shift in the level of tolerance
for gay and lesbian representation. However, this conclusion is 130

2012 not self-evident, as some have claimed, but is rather the product
of Ellen's interaction with ''the complex and changing discursive
processes by which identities are ascribed, resisted, or embraced, and
which processes themselves are unremarked and indeed achieve their
effect because they are not noticed'' (Scott, 1993, p. 408). It is this
interaction, [of the liberatory coming-out narrative, of television's
historical patterns of homosexual representation and of the
personalizing of sexuality in the Ellen episodes discussed below, that
produces the grounds for claiming Ellen as emancipatory]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Link -- Black Quiet

#### The affirmative's speech takes place in the public sphere, dictating what it means to engage in humanness and creates a universal ideal of life predicated on the ability to exclude. The public sphere is a space of impossibility for a racialized or gendered subject, creating the need for the counterpublic, the domain of the marginalized. The formation of counterpublics attaches racial and gendered subjects to a single mode of existence -- resistance.

**[To explore fully the relationship between black culture and
publicness requires a brief consideration of]{.underline}** the public
sphere as an intrinsic feature of modernity. Jürgen Habermas, in The
Structural Transformation of the \"Public Sphere , first imagined **[the
public sphere as a historical construct]{.underline}**. **[In
modernity,]{.underline}** Habermas suggests**[, publicness is analogous
to agency and freedom, and to participate in the public sphere is
precisely what it means to be a modern citizen.3]{.underline}**
Habermas\'s argument idealizes the individual and even implicitly
proclaims publicness as a subjectivity , setting a correlation between
free-willed participation in public matters on one hand, and humanity on
the other. In this regard, **[the exemplary human being is expressive
and demonstrative and articulate in a public context]{.underline}**.
This ideal of public selfhood is not available to everyone. Habermas
himself cites education and property ownership as necessary criteria for
participation in the public sphere, criteria that would have excluded
most women, nonwhites, and subsistence laborers. Moreover, the
Habermasian idiom of [**the public sphere depends on the ability to
imagine oneself as the universal ideal**, as the exemplary modern
citizen. This expectation is a further exclusion, since **it is nearly
conceptually impossible for a racialized or gendered subject to be at
once a symbol of difference and universality**]{.underline}.4 It is
Nancy Fraser\'s classic essay \"Rethinking the Public Sphere\" that
makes clear Habermas\'s exclusions and proffers a correction. **[Fraser
argues]{.underline}** that Habermas ignores **[the counterpublic
spheres, those sites of publicness that are alternative to and
challenging of the bourgeois exclusivity of his ideal. These
counterpublics are the domain of marginalized people and reveal
subjectivities that are contrary to the ideals of the hegemonic public
sphere]{.underline}**.5 Fraser\'s rethinking is astute, though it leaves
unchecked the valorization of publicness as an integer of subjectivity.
Indeed, **[to embrace the notion of counterpublics is to accept that the
marginalized subject is contrarian - resistant - and that her identity
is determined by her publicness]{.underline}** (albeit an alternative
one). In this context, the idea of counterpublics is not useful in
disarming the discourse of publicness.6 Nonetheless, Fraser\'s
[celebration of counterpublic has broad appeal in black
culture.]{.underline} As Houston Baker argues, [black culture is \"drawn
to the possibilities of structurally and affectively transforming the
founding notion of the bourgeois public sphere into an expressive and
empowering self- fashioning\"]{.underline} (13). Baker goes on to
suggest that [black culture situates its \"unique forms of expressive
publicity in . . . relationship \... to the sense of publicity itself as
authority]{.underline}\" (13-14; emphasis added). **[This authority is
founded on the legacy of public discourse as the crucial site of racial
formation; that is, since the black subject is made, misnamed, and
violated in the public sphere, it is through the public sphere that she
can be liberated.]{.underline}** Such fidelity in publicness reflects a
belief that \"**[the struggle to make something public is a struggle for
justice\"]{.underline}** (Benhabib 79), or at least can be. This
conflation of publicness and justice represents the large degree to
which publicness is accepted as the defining aspect of citizenship and
human agency, even for those marginalized in its wake. In fact, as Baker
suggests, **[the public assertion of alternative narratives to contrast
racist discourse is a defining feature of the struggle for black civil
rights]{.underline}**.7 [Given the historical intersection between
publicness and blackness, the two terms become amalgamated, at least
conceptually; as a result, **the idea of expressiveness as a feature of
black culture is wholly shaped by the discourse of publicness.
Specifically, black publicness is equated with black
expressiveness**]{.underline} , an equation that is both imposed on and
embraced by black culture. Examples of this embrace are evident in
scholarly studies of contemporary black culture such as Geneva Gay and
Willie Baber\'s Expressively Black, Shane White and Graham White\'s
Stylin\' Monique Guillory and Richard Green\'s Soul: Black Power ;
Politics, and Pleasure , Gina Dent\'s Black Popular Culture , and in
many of the artistic manifestos from the Harlem Renaissance and from the
Black Arts/Black Aesthetic movements. [Studies of early black culture
are also contextualized by a near-essentializing of public
expressiveness]{.underline}: for example, in his important work on
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century material production titled By the
Work of Their Hands, John Michael Vlach highlights [expressiveness as a
black aesthetic that serves as a tonic against obscurity]{.underline}
(19). There again is the contrarian impulse, where **[expressiveness is
essentially public as a counter to marginalization. In this way,
expressiveness has been vital to promoting black culture and liberation;
in fact it is not an overstatement to say that it is closely linked to
every black civil rights effort, and is the ultimate archetype of the
culture]{.underline}**. [The case could even be made that black
expressiveness, rather than being a function of the public
sphere]{.underline}, is an African cultural retention, which is what
Robert Farris Thompson proposes in Flash of the Spirit. (Vlach himself
argues convincingly that the aesthetic expressiveness found in early
black folk art is both a retention and a functional reality of enslaved
people.) [Yet this appreciation leaves **untouched the ways that the
relationship between blackness and publicness overdetermines how
expressiveness is read**, what expressiveness means. **In light of the
discourse of publicness, expressiveness is reduced to being contrarian
and resistant. There is little liberty or reason to consider other kinds
of expressivities, ones that are animated less by a sense of audience
and more by the wide range of human impulses**]{.underline}. Indeed this
[failure to imagine other expressivities obscures and even disavows
manifestations of black culture that fall outside the aesthetic that
publicness has either made, or made possible.]{.underline}

#### Containing black expression as a public act of resistance forecloses the possibility for inner life. The ballot becomes recognition of the worthiness of black cultural expression -- the 1AC is only meaningful if it is endorsed by the very structures they criticize. Interiority is suppressed and disavowed by the public dimension of race and racism, rendering it an empty assessment incapable of beauty and intimacy as an act in nd of itself.

[As a consequence of this historical significance of public
expressiveness, resistance becomes the dominant idiom for reading and
describing black culture. One result of this dominance is that the major
concepts used to discuss black culture (for example, doubleness,
signifying, the mask) are engaged largely for their capacity to support
the idea of resistance]{.underline}. In this light, these concepts say
less about the interior of black subjectivity, and leave us without a
general concept that aims to describe or reference the inner life.
Consider the example of doubleness, one of the central idioms of black
cultural studies. In terms of articulations of doubleness, there is
perhaps no concept more significant than that of W E. B. Du Bois\'s
double consciousness. A term of art for the psychology of the African
American codified in the opening chapter of The Souls of Black Folk ,
double consciousness describes the experience of having two conflicting
identities. In Du Bois\'s formulation, this split identity is the
definitive impact that oppression has on **[the black subject, who sees
himself through the revelations of the dominant world.]{.underline}**
Double consciousness is based on the general notion that selfhood is
achieved through interactions with other people, but when imagined as
particular to black identity, the term suggests something more: it
d[escribes a black subject whose being is conscripted not only by race
but also, especially, by a racist discourse. In short, double
consciousness conceptualizes black subjectivity as conflict with
whiteness and conceives agency only as/in resistance of the public
discourse of black inferiority]{.underline}. Strikingly, in Du Bois\'s
enunciation, [the black subject **seems to possess no genuine interior
and therefore, as much as double consciousness is a contemplative idiom,
it is insufficient as a concept of interiority**]{.underline} (it
\"yields no true self-consciousness\" ill\]). This implication is
sustained in our contemporary engagement of the concept. Du Bois\'s
double consciousness is similar to Darlene Clark Hine\'s notion of
dissemblance, which Hine coined to characterize black women\'s
ambivalent relationship to public exposure. Hine argues that [black
women, in response to how they were negatively constructed in the social
imagination as racial, gendered, and classed subjects, \"developed and
adhered to a cult of secrecy, a culture of dissemblance, to protect the
sanctity of inner aspects of their lives.]{.underline} The dynamics of
dissemblance involved creating the appearance of disclosure, or openness
about themselves and their feelings, while actually remaining an
enigma\" (915). She goes on to assert that \"in the face of pervasive
stereotypes \... it was imperative that they collectively create
alternative self-images\" (916). **[Such use of duplicity as a politic
of resistance]{.underline}** has been well documented by Hine and
others.9 While neither double consciousness nor dissemblance explicitly
**[dismisses the idea of interiority]{.underline}**, each nonetheless
**[suggests that interiority is suppressed and disavowed because of the
public dimensions of race and racism]{.underline}** (and, in the case of
dissemblance, gender and sexism). As concepts of doubleness, both idioms
forego the vagaries of the inner life in favor of a notion of selfhood
that is calibrated to the exterior world. The withholding or silence
that is implied in both concepts celebrates a kind of artifice or
performance, and reiterates the centrality of publicness in black
cultural identity. The irony here is that, conceptually, rather than
reinforce artifice as an essential practice, dissemblance and double
consciousness seem primed to help us scrutinize the suppressed
textualities of black identity, to touch greater depths of the
subjectivities that are flattened by the broad sweep of racism. Yet,
more often than not, what we learn from the use of these tropes is not
the subtlety of the human subject, but rather the dynamism of
concealment. These claims about the aesthetics of doubleness are evident
in looking at Paul Laurence Dunbar\'s poem \"We Wear the Mask,\" a
remarkable work of signifying and concealment, and an example of another
celebrated idiom of black culture - the idea of masking. First published
in 1895, the poem is a technical marvel, sustaining perfect singular
rhyme with every line echoing the same final assonance, except in three
places - the repetition of the titular \"mask\" at the end of stanzas
two and three, and the use of the word \"subtleties\" to end stanza one.
What is striking about the rhythmic disruption that \"subtleties\"
causes is that visually, the word seems to fit the rhyme scheme - it
looks like it should rhyme with \"lies,\" \"eyes,\" or \"cries.\" This
is a poetic sleight of hand with which Dunbar seems to play on the
tendency of the mind to want to follow the poem\'s sing-song rhythm (it
is perfect iambic tetrameter, except for this disruption), to force
\"subtleties\" to sound like the words that end the lines before it.
Further evidence of the poem\'s cunning is the slowly revealed truth
that the near-perfect rhyme actually turns on the approximate rhyme
between two sets of words that have the same long vowel sound but do not
rhyme in their consonants: \"lies\" and \"eyes,\" on one hand; \"guile\"
and \"smile\" on the other. The poem\'s mask is not only its subject but
its form (it even impersonates the sonnet, intentionally going one line
too far in a deceptive act of formlessness), and the doubleness implied
in Dunbar\'s careful diction - cheeks, shades, grins, lies, guile,
smile, hides, subtleties - is applicable also to his manipulation of the
rhyme. Dunbar\'s poem is brilliant in its technique and powerful in its
general theme, but what is also notable is how little it says about the
interiority of the masked subject. Other than bold declamations about
\"tortured souls\" and \"bleeding hearts,\" one knows nothing about the
\"we\" whose selves are masked, about the depth or quality of their
desires or fears. (Part of this is effected by the use of the
first-person plural, in the way the pronoun \"we\" flattens as much as
it unifies.) We learn in depth about the aesthetic of the mask and its
value as a ruse against oppression, about the masked persona\'s
awareness of audience and the perils of publicness, but nothing of the
subject. Indeed, even as the poem suggests that **[there is agency in
the act of withholding one\'s true self from being
revealed]{.underline}** - a claim punctuated by repetition of the tide
in the poem\'s last line - **[the agency does not allow the poem\'s
masked subject to express selfhood beyond the surface of a deceptive
smile. There is little quality of an inner life to be found here; at
best, one can infer that the wearer of the mask is either pained and
rageful, or deceiving - but nothing else]{.underline}**. This does not
diminish the brilliance of Dunbar\'s poem, which is peerless for its
marriage of form and content, and which, like Du Bois\'s idea of double
consciousness, imagines doubleness as a site of agency rather than only
subjection. Nevertheless, the poem evidences that an aesthetic of guile
is an inept means for rendering the inner life. Dunbar\'s poem could
have used the trope of masking to tell us something about the edge and
pasture of one human\'s experience, a telling that would have expanded
the archive of black subjectivity; instead the poem defers to a broader,
less intimate view and characterizes a subjectivity that in its
sketchiness feels caricatured.11 **[The limitations of masking and
doubleness are consequences of the way these terms have become part of a
larger aesthetic of black resistance. That is, though both are used to
support the idea of resistance]{.underline}**, the problem is not with
the idioms or even with the idea of expressiveness; **[it is instead the
difficulty with the assumption that all black expressiveness is
necessarily public]{.underline}**. **[This assumption limits black
expression to the discourse of resistance, and without other concepts
with which to understand expressiveness, resistance becomes the lingua
franca of black culture]{.underline}**. It is in this regard that [the
notion of black culture as expressive is an empty assessment, one that
is limited in its meaningfulness. And in the face of the strong
relationship between publicness, expressiveness and resistance, black
cultural studies lacks a metaphor for character- izing the inner life, a
metaphor capable of noticing the beauty and intimacy of Smith and
Carlos]{.underline}.

#### Liberalism's victim fetish perpetuates insidious violences\-- it instantiates a mode of subjectivity where one's claim to humanity is predicated on their ability to be injured. This locates injured subjects at permanent sites of violation, turning the aff.

The statistics discussed above speak of how we grieve and whether or not
we are the bereft. They bring up our [capacities to suffer and our ways
of relating to suffering, our own and others. These issues extend beyond
sufferings graspable in these statistics, to those limit-cases where
these measurements and quantifications fail]{.underline}. In cases of
immense suffering---especially "natural" suffering---other forms of
translation and sense-making have to kick in, in order to mediate our
experience of them. [The regime of valuing suffering endemic to
liberalism does not leave the sphere of this "readymade" suffering
untouched]{.underline}. The arbitrary values placed on various
sufferings also appear in the realm of grand disasters, their definition
flagging the thresholds---of political sensibility and of the ability to
suffer---that help plot liberal discourse. [Any crisis, disaster or
injury comes to be within a sensuous machinery involving interpreters,
translators and sufferers]{.underline}. While statistics such as the
DALYs exemplify the creation of an event out of suffering so that it can
at least count even if only in this paltry way, the case of natural
disasters or genocide---"events" first, one's suffering and another's
medal for philanthropy after---liberal modernity does something
importantly different. It shows off its specialty in readymade events of
human suffering that can then be rendered productive. Both cases---of
producing events and of rendering events productive---obscure and
dislocate the suffering that necessitates the making of an event and the
suffering that is caused by the sensuous pathology of liberalism. [Ways
of treating suffering that define the terms of a disaster and the terms
in which a disaster is read can also dysfunctionalize sense and mute
other voices]{.underline}. One eventually just forgets to speak, or
speaks only to affirm or negate. Kant teaches us to talk about suffering
only so far as it is caused by human action;[liberalism's naturalised
focus is on the injuriousness and harmfulness of human beings whose
ownership of their bodies and their selves is predicated on their
ability to be injured]{.underline}. This ownership relies on a
separation of the domains of god and man whereby suffering itself is
secularised. When this happens, explanations are given in the form of
who is responsible for the suffering in order to assess whether it is an
injury that is addressable or suffering that, absent being rendered
injury, must be quickly shelved somewhere else. So, [the secularism of
suffering counters the non-metaphysical claims of political liberals by
clearly showing that even unassuming liberals cannot help but assume and
operationalize a particular metaphysics of suffering ]{.underline}as
they, in the most basic way, determine the spaces where certain forms of
suffering are allowed to dwell.

### 1NC -- Link - Multiculturalism

#### Recognition of one's self-identity in a multiculturalist nation through transparency involves the recognition of others within this nation with the same identity. Nation-building also requires some-body or some-where to not-be for it to be.

How are nations invented and imagined? The work of Benedict Anderson is
crucial for an understanding of how 'the nation' is imaginary or
fantastic. According to Anderson, both nationalism and nationhood are
'cultural artefacts' (1983: 13), with their own particular 'style in
which they are imagined' (1983: 15). Such an approach allows us to
recognise that [the boundaries of nations are]{.underline} not simply
geographical or geopolitical (though they take both these forms), but
[also discursive. The nation does not refer to something that simply
exists: nations are produced and constructed as places and communities
in which 'a people' might belong. Of course, to say that nations are
imagined is not to say that they are not real.]{.underline} The question
of nationhood cannot be properly addressed without a recognition of the
political economy of modern nation-states. An entity can be imagined and
real at the same time: in some sense, the opposition between imaginary
and real must be suspended if we are to understand how the nation comes
to be lived as an 'organic community'. [The imagining of the nation as a
space in which 'we' belong is not independent of the material deployment
of force, and the forms of governmentality which control, not only the
boundaries between nation states, and the movements of citizens and
aliens within the state, but also the repertoire of images which allows
the concept of the nation to come into being in the first place To think
of the nation as simultaneously imaginary and real (the nation as both
fantasy and material effect) is also to think of the processes of
identification which allow the nation to be secured as one of the
organising assumptions of 'public life']{.underline} (Goffman 1972: ix).
What forms of identification are produced with the nation? How does 'the
nation' come to be produced as a form of identification? In other words,
**[we need to examine how the invention of the nation as a bounded space
requires the production of a national identity which can be claimed by
the individual]{.underline}** ('I am ... ') **[through reference to the
apparent transparency and coherence of the nation itself]{.underline}**.
The investment of the individual in being or having a nation suggests
that the discourse of nationhood operates at both a psychic and social
level**[. The individual, who encounters others in daily life, comes to
identify as not only having but being a nationality, through referring
to public symbols and expressions which themselves tell stories of what
it means to be that nationality (the fleshing out of the 'national
character'), and also through identifying with other individuals with
whom such stories can be shared.]{.underline}** The production of the
nation involves not only image and myth-making -- the telling of
'official' stories of origin -- but also the everyday negotiations of
what it means 'to be' that nation(ality). [The production of the nation
involves processes of self-identification in which the nation comes to
be realised as belonging to the individual]{.underline} (the
construction of the 'we' as utterable by the individual). Crucially,
then, the production of nations constitutes individuals as belonging to
the nation: the work of 'the nation' is done as much through the
everyday encounters in public life, as it is done through the political
machinery of the nation-state. But the production of the nation also
involves imagining the nation space: it involves the projection of
boundaries (nationhood as cartography), and the telling of stories about
the authentic landscape (for example, in travel writing and tourism),
and the production of interiority (imagining 'the heart of the nation').
The construction of the nation space takes place alongside the
production of national character as instances in which 'the nation'
itself is fleshed out as place and person. The nation becomes imagined
as a body in which personhood and place are precariously collapsed.
Through a metonymic elision, the individual can claim to embody a
nation, or the nation can take the shape of the body of an individual
('bodyscape'). But how do the complex and multiple sites of the
production of nationhood involve the reification of the figure of the
stranger? As I pointed out in my introduction, the formation of a
dwelling or place of residence involves a definition of who or what does
not belong (estrangement). At one level, such distinctions between the
familiar and the strange take place in everyday encounters. [**The
self-identification with the nation also involves the recognition of
others as belonging to the 'same' community**. If we return to my
discussion of recognition in Chapter 1, we can consider how the act of
hailing or recognising some-body as a shared member of a community
serves to produce or flesh out that community through or against the
bodies of strangers.]{.underline} For example, the recognition of
another as belonging to the same nation when travelling abroad relies on
techniques for reading and telling the difference between that which is
familiar and strange. The recognition of the other as from a shared
nation requires a rehearsal of a public discourse of nationhood (shared
memories of the nation space, the use of jokes, reference to sporting
events or national achievements). **[The recognition of others as being
from the same nation, or as sharing a nationality, hence involves an
everyday and much rehearsed distinction between who does and does not
belong within the nation space. The production of the nation, in such a
model, requires some-body or some-where to not-be in order for it to
be.]{.underline}** [This demarcation of spaces of belonging through
estrangement is central to Said's now classical theory of Orientalism:
the Occident comes into being as a material place through the creation
of an ontological distinction between it and the Orient. The Orient
comes to embody that which the Occident is not.]{.underline} That is,
the Orient creates Europe (or the Occident) as a bounded space in the
very event of being positioned as its Other. The fascination with the
Orient within Western imperial culture is a fascination which, in Said's
terms, creates an idea of Europe, 'a notion collectively identifying "us
against the non-Europeans" ' (1978: 7). Orientalism creates an imaginary
geographical divide based on the binarism of Occident/Orient. In this
sense, the creation of a space of belonging (the 'we' that remains
unspoken, or is spoken only through the claiming of the right to speak)
requires that which is strange in order to be. The nation is one such
space of belonging. Robin Cohen's reflection on the discourse of
nationhood emphasises how national identity is produced through the
differentiation between familiar and strange: 'a complex national and
social identity is continuously constructed and reshaped in its (often
antipathetic) interaction with outsiders, strangers, foreigners and
aliens -- the "others". You know who you are, only by knowing who you
are not' (1994: 1). In Cohen's model, [strangers are not external to the
formation of national identity: the nation requires strangers in order
to exist. Despite this, the formation of identity is defined in terms of
frontiers: strangers are the ones who are encountered at the border, and
whose proximity threatens the coherence of national
identity]{.underline}. Féher and Heller's consideration of nations poses
an analogy between 'the nation' and the 'house': 'a country has a
certain number of inhabitants who are supposed to close the doors behind
them, not to let in any casual stranger without a preliminary agreement;
however it can also open its doors' (1994: 143). Here, the question of
the stranger in the nation is a question of opening or closing the
doors: the stranger can either be let in or kept out. What I want to
suggest in contrast is that the definition of the nation as a space,
body, or house requires the proximity of 'strangers' within that space,
whether or not that proximity is deemed threatening (monoculturalism) or
is welcomed (multiculturalism). A key problem in this literature on
nationhood is the use of the model of 'generalisable other', in which
national identity is simply defined through and against an other, as
such (Cohen 1994: 1). What is demanded is a much more contextual and
nuanced understanding of the role of differentiated others in the
demarcation of national identity. In Chapter 2, I examined how bodily
integrity is produced, not simply through or against a generalisable
other, but by differentiating between others, who have a different
function in establishing the permeability of bodily space. [The very
habits and gestures of marking out bodily space involve differentiating
'others' into familiar (assimilable, touchable) and strange
(unassimilable, untouchable). While I would not want to imply that we
can make a simple analogy between bodies and nations, I think we can
understand how bodily and social spaces leak into each other, or inhabit
each other (see also Chapter 4). The nation becomes imagined and
embodied as a space, not simply by being defined against other spaces,
but by being defined as close to some others (friends), and further away
from other others (strangers). In this sense, only some others are read
as strangers within the nation space. The proximity of strangers within
the nation space -- that is, the proximity of that which cannot be
assimilated into a national body -- is a mechanism for the demarcation
of the national body, a way of defining borders within it, rather than
just between it and an imagined and exterior other.]{.underline}

The second key aspect of multiculturalism in the National Agenda is
social justice, defined as, 'the right of all Australians to equality of
treatment and opportunity, and the removal of barriers of race,
ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender or place of birth'. Here,
we have a clear statement of multicultural justice within the liberal
framework of equality of opportunity (with its negative model of
freedom) and individualism. The markers of difference are defined as
barriers that restrict the movements and capacities of essentially
disembodied individuals. **[The commitment to social justice is defined
through a neo-liberal discourse: multiculturalism can be just in this
framework, only insofar as it refuses to recognise the differences that
it supposedly not only describes but also manages.]{.underline}**
[Again, such differences are not only managed, but erased under the
signifier of individual freedom, the individual who embodies the justice
of Australian 'multiculturalism for all']{.underline}. The final key
aspect of multiculturalism is economic efficiency, 'the need to
maintain, develop and utilize effectively the skills and talents of all
Australians regardless of their background' (emphasis added). Later, in
the section on human resources, the following statement is offered:
People, as much as machines, are a crucial input to economic performance
and growth. Effective and efficient development and utilisation of our
human resources is essential if Australia's economic potential is to be
realised fully. ... Multicultural policies seek to maximise the
contribution -- the experience, job skills and entrepreneurial talents
of all Australians to the economic life of the community. The term 'all
Australians' is qualified by the phrase, 'regardless of their
background'. This suggests that the goal of economic efficiency in
multicultural Australia is partly about making the most of the resources
and skills offered by those 'real' but not 'typical' Australians
(despite the sustained emphasis on the blanket term, 'all Australians').
We can refer back to my discussion of global nomads in Chapter 4, where
I argued that they become highly commodifiable as skilled workers in a
global or transnational economy of difference. Likewise, within the
modern late capitalist nation-state, multiculturalism can also be about
the production of a better workforce who can deal with the multiple
networks and forms of exchange in global capitalism. [This is what makes
most sense of Paul Keating's declaration, 'I am Asian', and his
description of Australia as a 'multicultural nation in Asia'. Here,
multiculturalism is about achieving a workforce that is better equipped
to trade with nearby Asian countries: it is about the maximisation of
profit in the interest of 'the Australian economy'. Such a discourse of
economic efficiency, at the very same time, conceals the class and
racial stratification of the Australian workforce: it conceals, for
example, how migrant workers tend to occupy lower paid and unskilled
positions.]{.underline} This narrative defines multiculturalism as a
better form of management and use of 'the resources' of those from a
non-English speaking background,1 at the very same time as it conceals
the historical determination of difference as profit (by explicitly
defining multiculturalism in terms of human resources). Lisa Lowe's
comments on multiculturalism in the United States have a clear resonance
here: 'the production of multiculturalism at once "forgets" history, and
in this forgetting, exacerbates a contradiction between the
concentration of capital within a dominant class group and the
unattended conditions of a working class increasingly made up of
heterogeneous immigrant, racial, and ethnic groups' (1996: 86)

#### The assimilation of the Other into the nation never works and breeds anti-Other sentiments from within the nation.

Meanwhile, there is a darker echo that restates the gestures of global
white assistance--- philanthropic, structurally adjusted, diversity
inclusive, military occupied, and otherwise---as a conjugated
dehumanization. The echo shudders an anti-colonial and
plantation-burning violence, another kind of redemption in the symbolic
genesis of white humanity's de-centering[. In this instance, it is not
the dark suffering that matters, but rather the fact of **the exposure,
the vulnerability, the imminence and inevitability of the
suffering---this is what explodes the presumptuous arrogance of the
white humanist universal**, which is another way of saying that in this
glimpse, we are daring to privilege the inheritance of a sensibility
that the world exists on Mankind's terms, and this is an intimacy with
the most alienating feeling]{.underline}. To be in a world not of your
making, [to be told that you must become in a manner alien to the
conditions of your exposure. It is often this alienation that fosters
another differentiation, one that speaks collective genius in the
imagining and fugitive practice of Mankind's obsolescence, the
denaturing of the human speciation and thus, the reduction of white evil
(by extension, white liberal humanism) to a localized, dysfunctional,
even tribal matter that finally has little or nothing to do with the
insurgency of all other life,]{.underline} including the other humans
who have fantasized the demise of Mankind over many generations. The
violence of which they accuse the savages and the slaves is often
attributed to this idea. Merely the idea. In Dallas a few are felled by
a sniper's rounds in the midst of a demonstration for Black lives that
was irreparably, painstakingly, also pro-police. A scattering
thereafter, unsure how to read the blood on tar, a few wondering aloud
what would happen if the fleeting moment of anti-state terror were
socialized against its dense congruence with the proto-genocidal facts
of Blackness. Here is another opportunity to alter the protocols of war
by considering the absolute asymmetries of fatality and
casualty---another way of showing the identity of law and brutality,
thus the misapplication of our common phrase, "police brutality."
Consider the recent periods of crisis, emergency, and militant reformist
demand as a political inheritance in continuity with the limits of that
internal "American" debate. [In this framing, the stakes are entirely
affixed to the reorientations of Mankind and the question of whether a
potential transformation (expansion) of its imagined collective is
remotely capable of altering the intensity of casualties that fabricate
the Indian, the Negro, the Alien,]{.underline} et. al. The blurring
conflations of human life (in all its vulnerability and incommensurable
wildness) with Mankind (in its self-narratives of autonomy, mastery, and
ascendancy) provoke the other allegations of redemption, which are only
ever aspirational. It is why, in contemporary parlance[, "diversity" is
always tethered to "tolerance and respect**:" the vulnerable wild ones
are the subjects of a domestication that never quite
works**]{.underline}. The sources of the echo are the involuntary
inhabitants of the blurring, outside Mankind (subhuman, colonized,
expropriated, chattel) and incarcerated by the contingencies of white
civil society's freedoms[. To live inside the blur in this way is to be
intimately familiar with the perpetual condition of war and conquest,
even as there is constant struggle to apprehend the consequences of the
totality, because there are counter-positions within the
blur]{.underline}. There are casualties of varying intensity, some
contingent and others paradigmatic. Yet there remains a persistent
demand that crosses these counter-positions, anchored in the demand for
security of body and the dream of collective futurity. This demand-dream
runs the risk of coalescing with the terms of the internal debate. [It
is the militancy of an insistence on becoming the tolerated and
respected, which of course is not really a becoming at all.]{.underline}
This is when the echo is most open to misreadings,
disciplined-harnessed-monetized by the organized entrepreneurial
compromises of the "Non-Governmental Organizations" and the Non-Profit
Industrial Complex. We should be clear that the problem is not
necessarily in the desire for redemption as a protective capacity in
circumstances of duress. (At times, finding redemption through faith and
spiritual practice is the only accessible pathway to insurgent
mobilization around a shared social-historical as well as extra-earthly
fate.) Rather, the dilemma is in the horizon of the fulfillment. What
would happen on the eve of White Being's concession that Black lives
matter? The terms of the internal debate can only allow for the gesture
of a concession, which subsists on some peculiar idiosyncrasies: the
notion of policing in equitability**[; a reordering of statecraft and
cultural structure that affirms respect for and tolerance of those other
lives; a statement of egalitarian value that nonetheless endorses
another apartheid principle of human speciation, "separate but
equal."]{.underline}** It becomes clear that redemption in winning
protective capacity is only that, and only for now. This is a problem of
mistaken or misplaced horizons. Of course, horizons are open to
interpretation and imagination, and must be projected as a matter of
definition, so there is plenty of room to do good work here, which
requires that the problem of political horizon be posed in the first
place, as a problem, in fact, as the kind of problem that renders the
conventional (and often indulgent or opportunistic) dichotomy of
"theory" and "practice" irrelevant. [Perhaps there is already a solution
to the problem, an ingenious rearticulation of the dilemma of
mis-imagined, dys-imagined horizon that unfolds in basements,
classrooms, and text message strings all the time, everywhere: there is
an understanding that resonates in the dark echoing of the problem
solvers]{.underline} (the children, the students, the elders, the
shamed, the punished, the abnormal, the sick, the crazy---or so they
say). The understanding forms as a byproduct of coerced overfamiliarity
with what it means to seek redemption in evil, a knowledge that the
adjudication of the internal debate occurs in a general symbiosis with
the enforcement of cultural-juridical-military statutes that constantly
reconstruct and affirm the anti-civilizational profile; that of those
who are drawn into the profile, [there are some old, some new, because
criminals, terrorists, deviants, aliens, have always been around, some
longer than others, and there's little mistaking the Black and
Aboriginal common denominator in all of it. The understanding grows and
spreads, that the anti-civilizational is an honorable inheritance,
because it surges into domesticities that are always again frontiers;
the plantation is an idea as much as a place, which is why it never goes
away, territory (land) is always invoked, and it all materializes in the
endlessly justifiable homicide that defines "freedom's"
limits]{.underline}. Move, then, to the margins of the reputable, just
beneath the high ground, flourishing in the tears and sobbing, studying
within the mourning and grieving, theorizing the pain, it's already
happening, and it needs no refinement.

### 1NC -- Link - Affectivity

#### The aff retains a sentimental investment in groups of belonging whose self image of themselves enables them to enact fascist demonizations of other Others under the guise of "shared feelings of liberation". Rather than being liberatory affects, these representations are the condition of possibility for violation and pain to continue, turning the aff.

In the genealogy we have been tracking, **[sentimental modes are
tactically appropriated to produce political worlds and citizen-subjects
who are regulated by the natural justice that is generated by suffering
and trauma.]{.underline}** But the Uncle Tom form has also engendered a
parallel universe of textual resistance-to the Uncle Tom form itself.
First and foremost, this constellation of dissident texts refuses to
reproduce the fascinated pleasure-in-violence so spectacularly hardwired
into the white and U.S.- identified memory of slavery, even when that
memory is used reparatively to express white guilt or national apology.
The use of the Uncle Tom form against its fundamental claims involves a
refusal to elevate the ethic of personal sacrifice, suffering, and
mourning over a politically \"interested\" will to socially
transformative action; and it repudiates a tendency to use
self-exonerating rhetorical distractions like slapstick, romance, or
tragedy to draw a self-critical boundary between an \"enlightened\"
present and an unfortunate past. An author\'s or text\'s refusal to
reproduce the sublimation of subaltern struggles into conventions of
narrative satisfaction and redemptive fantasy might be called
\"postsentimentality,\" a resistant strain of the sentimental domain.
**[Plots in this mode remain saturated by the ideal of a \"one people\"
that can absorb all difference and struggle into a sponge of true
feeling. That metacultural ideal of liberal empathy is so embedded in
the horizon of ethico- political fantasy that alternative models-for
example, those that do not track power in terms of its subjective
effects-can seem inhuman, hollow, and irrelevant to the ways people
experience optimism and powerlessness in ordinary life]{.underline}**.
Postsentimental narratives are lacerated by ambivalence: they struggle
constantly with their own attachment to the promise of unconflictedness
and intimacy with which the U.S. sentimental tradition gifts its
politically exhausted and cynically extended citizens. Tableaux of
effective domestic pedagogy, moral praxis, and sheer peace dominate
narratives that exemplify concepts of justice and freedom in tales of
personal destiny. How to deprivatize politics without merely demonizing
the fantasy state liberalism proposes? What distinguishes these critical
texts are the startling ways they struggle to encounter the Uncle Tom
form without reproducing it, declining to pay the inheritance tax. The
postsentimental does not involve an aesthetic disruption to the contract
sentimentality makes between its texts and readers -that proper reading
will lead to better feeling and therefore to a better self. What changes
is the place of repetition in this contract, a crisis frequently
thematized in formal aesthetic and generational terms. In its
traditional and political modalities, **[the sentimental promises that
in a just world a consensus will already exist about what constitutes
uplift, amelioration, and emancipation, those horizons toward which
empathy powerfully directs itself.]{.underline}** **[Identification with
suffering, the ethical response to the sentimental plot, leads to its
repetition in the audience and thus to a generally held view about what
transformations would bring the good life into being]{.underline}**.
**[This presumption, that the terms of consent are trans historical once
true feeling is shared, explains in part why emotions, especially
painful ones, are so central to the world-building aspects of
sentimental alliance.]{.underline}** Postsentimental texts withdraw from
the contract that presumes consent to the conventionally desired
outcomes of identification and empathy. The desire for unconflictedness
might very well motivate the sacrifice of surprising ideas to the norms
of the world against which this rhetoric is being deployed. What, if
anything, then, can be built from the very different
knowledge/experience of subaltern pain? What can memory do to create
conditions for freedom and justice without reconfirming the terms of
ordinary subordination? More than a critique of feeling as such, the
postsentimental modality also challenges what literature and
storytelling have come to stand for in the creation of sentimental
national subjects across an almost two-century span. Three moments in
this genealogy, which differ as much from each other as from the
credulous citation of Uncle Tom\'s Cabin we saw in The King and I and
Dimples, will mark here some potential within the arsenal that counters
the repetition compulsions of sentimentality. This essay began with a
famous passage from James Baldwin\'s \"Everybody\'s Protest Novel,\" a
much-cited essay about Uncle Tom\'s Cabin that is rarely read in the
strong sense because its powerful language of rageful truth-telling
would shame in advance any desire to make claims for the tactical
efficacy of suffering and mourning in the struggle to transform the
United States into a postracist nation. I cited Baldwin\'s text to open
this piece not to endorse its absolute truth but to figure its
frustrated opposition to the sentimental optimism that equates the
formal achievement of empathy on a mass scale with the general project
of democracy. Baldwin\'s special contribution to what sentimentality can
mean has been lost in the social-problem machinery of mass society, in
which the production of tears where anger or nothing might have been
became more urgent with the coming to cultural dominance of the
Holocaust and trauma as models for having and remembering collective
social experience.20 Currently, as in traditional sentimentality, **[the
authenticity of overwhelming pain that can be textually performed and
shared is disseminated as a prophylactic against the reproduction of a
shocking and numbing mass violence]{.underline}**. Baldwin asserts that
**[the overvaluation of such redemptive feeling is precisely a condition
of that violence.]{.underline}** Baldwin\'s encounter with Stowe in this
essay comes amidst a general wave of protest novels, social-problem
films, and film noir in the U.S. after World War Two: Gentleman\'s
Agreement, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Best Years of Our Lives.
Films like these, he says, \"emerge for what they are: a mirror of our
confusion, dis honesty, panic, trapped and immobilized in the sunlit
prison of the American dream.\" They cut the complexity of human motives
and self-understanding \"down to size\" by preferring \"a lie more
palatable than the truth\" about the social and material effects the
liberal pedagogy of optimism has, or doesn\'t have, on \"man\'s\"
capacity to produce a world of authentic truth, justice, and freedom.21
Indeed, \"truth\" is the keyword for Baldwin. He defines it as \"a
devotion to the human being, his freedom and fulfillment: freedom which
cannot be legislated, fulfillment which cannot be charted.\"22 In
contrast, Stowe\'s totalitarian religiosity, her insistence that sub
jects \"bargain\" for heavenly redemption with their own physical and
spiritual mortification, merely and violently confirms the fundamental
abjection of all persons, especially the black ones who wear the dark
night of the soul out where all can see it. Additionally, Baldwin argues
that Uncle Tom\'s Cabin instantiates a tradition of locating the destiny
of the nation in a false model of the individual soul, one imagined as
free of ambivalence, aggression, or contradiction. By \"human being\"
Baldwin means to repudiate stock identities as such, arguing that their
stark simplicity confirms the very fantasies and institutions against
which the sentimental is ostensibly being mobilized. This national-
liberal refusal of complexity is what he elsewhere calls \"the price of
the ticket\" for membership in the American dream.23 As the Uncle Tom
films suggest, **[whites need blacks to \"dance\" for them so that they
might continue disavowing the costs or ghosts of white ness, which
involve religious traditions of self- loathing and cultural traditions
confusing happiness with analgesia.]{.underline}** The conventional
reading of \"Everybody\'s Protest Novel\" sees it as a violent rejection
of the sentimental.24 It is associated with the feminine (Little Women),
with hollow and dishonest capacities of feeling, with an aversion to the
real pain that real experience brings. \"**[Causes, as we know, are
notoriously bloodthirsty]{.underline}**,\" he writes.25 **[The politico
sentimental novel uses suffering vampirically to simplify the subject,
thereby making the injunction to empathy safe for the
subject.]{.underline}** Of course there is more to the story. Baldwin
bewails the sentimentality of Richard Wright\'s Native Son because
Bigger Thomas is not the homeopathic Other to Uncle Tom after all, but
one of his \"children,\" the heir to his negative legacy.26 Both Tom and
Thomas live in a simple relation to violence and die knowing only
slightly more than they did before they were sacrificed to a white ideal
of the soul\'s simple purity, its emptiness. **[This addiction to the
formula of redemption through violent simplification persists with a
\"terrible power\": it confirms that U.S. minorities are constituted as
Others even to themselves through attachment to the most hateful,
objectified, cartoon-like versions of their identities, and that the
shamed subcultures of America really are, in some way, fully expressed
by the overpresence of the stereotypical image.]{.underline}**

#### Sentimentality is at the core of national belonging\-- the aff's representation of death is not revolutionary but rather occurs in a liberal economy that invites mourning in order to sustain an investment in the existing hegemonic order of things.

Ravaged wages and [ravaged bodies saturate the global marketplace in
which the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [seeks]{.underline}
desperately [to compete]{.underline} "competitively," as the euphemism
goes, [signifying a race that will be won by the nations
whose]{.underline} labor [conditions are most optimal]{.underline} for
profit? In the United States [the media of the political public sphere
regularly register new scandals]{.underline} of the proliferating
sweatshop networks ["at home" and "abroad," which has to be a good
thing, because it produces feeling and with it something at least akin
to consciousness that can lead to action]{.underline}.3 [Yet even as the
image of the traumatized]{.underline} worker [proliferates]{.underline},
[even as evidence of exploitation is found under every rock or
commodity, **it competes with a normative/utopian image of the U.S.
citizens who remains unmarked**]{.underline}, [framed]{.underline}, [and
protected by the private trajectory of his life project which
is]{.underline} sanctified at the juncture where the unconscious meets
history: [the American Dream]{.underline}.4 in that story one's identity
is not borne of suffering, mental, physical, or economic. If the U.S.
Worker's lucky enough to live at an economic moment that sustains the
Dream he gets to appear at his least national when he is working and at
his most national at leisure, with his family or in semipublic worlds of
other men producing surplus manliness (e.g., via sports). In the
American dreamscape his identity is private property, a zone in which
structural obstacles and cultural differences fade into an ether of
prolonged, deferred, and individuating enjoyment that he has earned and
that the nation has helped him to earn. Meanwhile, [exploitation only
appears as a scandalous nugget in the sieve of memory when it can be
condensed into an exotic thing of momentary fascination]{.underline}, [a
squalor of the bottom too horrible to be read in its own actual
banality]{.underline}. [The exposed traumas]{.underline} of workers in
ongoing extreme conditions [do not]{.underline} generally [induce more
than mourning on the part of the state and the public culture to whose
feeling based opinions the state is said to respond]{.underline}.
[Mourning is what happens when a grounding object is lost, is dead, no
longer living (to you).]{.underline} [Mourning is an experience of
irreducible boundedness: I am here, I am living, he is
dead]{.underline}, I am mourning. [It is a beautiful]{.underline}, not
sublime, [experience of emancipation: mourning supplies the subject the
definitional perfection of a being no longer in flux]{.underline}. [It
takes place over a distance: even if the object who induces the feeling
of loss and helplessness is neither dead nor at any great
distance]{.underline} from where you are? In other words, [mourning can
also be an act of aggression, of social deathmaking: it can perform the
evacuation of significance from actually-existing subjects]{.underline}.
[Even when liberals do it]{.underline}, one might say, [are ghosted for
a good cause]{.underline}.6 [The sorrow songs of scandal that sing of
the exploitation that is always \"elsewhere\" (even a few blocks away)
are in this sense aggressively songs of mourning]{.underline}. [Play
them backward]{.underline}, [and the military march of capitalist
triumphalism]{.underline} ([The Trans-Nationale) can be
heard]{.underline}. [Its Lyric]{.underline}, [currently creamed by every
organ of record in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [is
about necessity. It exhorts citizens to understand that the \"bottom
line\" of national life is neither utopia nor freedom but
**survival**]{.underline}, which **[can only be achieved by a citizenry
that eats its anger]{.underline}**, **[makes no unreasonable claims on
resources or controls over value]{.underline}**, [**and uses its most
creative energy to cultivate intimate spheres** while scrapping a Life
together flexibly in response to the market world's
caprice]{.underline}8. In this particular moment of expanding class
unconsciousness that looks like consciousness emerges a peculiar, though
not unprecedented, here: the exploited child. If a worker can be
infantilized, pictured as young, as small, as feminine or feminized, as
starving, as bleeding and diseased, and as a (virtual) sieve, the
righteous indignation around procuring his survival resounds everywhere.
The child must not be sacrificed to states or to profiteering. His
wounded image speaks a truth that subordinates narrative: he has not
"freely" chosen his exploitation; the optimism and play that are
putatively the right of childhood have been stolen from him. Yet only
\"voluntary\" steps are ever taken to try to control this visible sign
of what is ordinary and systemic amid the chaos of capitalism, in order
in make its localized nightmares seem uninevitable. Privatize the
atrocity, delete the visible sign, make it seem foreign. Return the
child to the family, replace the children with admits who can look
dignified while being paid virtually the same revoking wage. The problem
that organizes so much feeling then regains livable proportions, and the
uncomfortable pressure of feeling dissipates, like so much gas.
Meanwhile, [the pressure of feeling the shock of being uncomfortably
political **produces a cry for a double therapy---to the victim and the
viewer**]{.underline}. [But before \"we\" appear too complacently
different from the privileged citizens who desire to caption the mute
image of exotic suffering with an aversively fascinated
mooning]{.underline} (a desire for the image to be dead, a ghost), [we
must note that this feeling culture crosses over into other domains, the
domains of what we call identity politics, where the wronged take up
voice and agency to produce transformative testimony, which depends on
an analogous conviction about the self-evidence and therefore the
objectivity of painful feeling.]{.underline} The central concern of this
essay is to address the place of painful feeling in the making of
political worlds. In particular, [I mean to challenge]{.underline} a
powerful popular [belief in the positive workings of]{.underline}
something I call **[national sentimentality]{.underline}**, [a rhetoric
of promise that a nation can be built across fields of social difference
through channels of affective identification and empathy]{.underline}.
[Sentimental politics]{.underline} generally **[promotes and maintains
the hegemony of the national identity form]{.underline}**, [no mean feat
in the face of continued widespread intercultural antagonism and
economic cleavage]{.underline}. But national sentimentality is more than
a current of feeling that circulates in a political field: the phrase
describes a longstanding contest between two models of US. citizenship.
In one, the classic made}, **[each citizen's value is secured by an
equation between abstractness and emancipation: a cell of national
identity provides juridically protected personhood for citizens
regardless of anything specific about them]{.underline}**. **[In the
second model]{.underline}**, [**which was initially** **organized around
labor**]{.underline}, **[feminist]{.underline}**, **[and antiracist
struggles of the nineteenth-century United States, another version of
the nation is imagined as the index of collective life]{.underline}**.
**[This nation is peopled by suffering citizens and noncitizens whose
structural exclusion from the utopian-American dreamscape exposes the
state\'s claim of legitimacy and virtue to an acid wash of truth telling
that makes hegemonic disavowal virtually impossible, at certain moments
of political intensity]{.underline}**. [Sentimentality has long been the
means by which mass subaltern pain is advanced]{.underline}, [in the
dominant public sphere]{.underline}, **[as the true core of national
collectivity]{.underline}**. [It operates when the pain of intimate
others burns into the conscience of classically privileged national
subjects]{.underline}, [such that they feel the pain of]{.underline}
flawed or [denied citizenship as their pain]{.underline}.
[Theoretically]{.underline}, to eradicate the pain those with power will
do whatever is necessary to return the nation once more to its
legitimately utopian order. [Identification with pain]{.underline}, [a
universal true feeling]{.underline}, [then leads to structural social
change]{.underline}. In return, subalterns scarred by the pain of failed
democracy will reauthorize universalist notions of citizenship in the
national utopia, which involves in a redemptive notion of law as the
guardian of public good. The object of the nation and the law in this
light is to eradicate systemic social pain, the absence of which becomes
the definition of freedom. [Yet, since these very sources of
protection]{.underline}---the state, the law, patriotic
ideology---[have]{.underline} traditionally [buttressed traditional
matrices of cultural hierarchy]{.underline}, [and since their historic
job has been to protect universal subject]{.underline} I citizens [from
feeling]{.underline} their culture} [and corporeal specificity as a
political vulnerability]{.underline}, [the imagined capacity of these
institutions to assimilate to the affective tactics of subaltern
counterpolitics suggests some weaknesses]{.underline}, [or
misrecognitions]{.underline}, [in these tactics]{.underline}. For one
thing, it may be that [the sharp specificity of the traumatic model of
pain]{.underline} implicitly [mischaracterizes what a person is as what
a person becomes in the experience of social negation]{.underline};
[this model also falsely premises a sharp picture of structural
violence\'s source and scope, in tum promoting a dubious optimism that
law and other visible sources of inequality]{.underline}, for example,
[can provide the best remedies for their own taxonomizing
harms]{.underline}. It is also possible that [counterhegemonic
deployments of pain as the measure of structural injustice actually
**sustain the utopian image of a homogeneous national
metaculture**]{.underline}, [**which can look like a healed or healthy
body** in contrast to the scarred and exhausted ones.]{.underline}
Finally, it might be that [the **tactical use of trauma** to describe
the effects of social inequality so **overidentifies the eradication of
pain with the achievement of justice** that it enables various
confusions]{.underline}: for instance, [the equation of pleasure with
freedom or the sense that changes in feeling]{.underline}, [even on a
mass scale]{.underline}, [amount to substantial social
change]{.underline}. [Sentimental politics makes these confusions
credible and these violences bearable]{.underline}, [as its cultural
power confirms the centrality of inter-personal identification and
**empathy to the vitality** and viability **of collective
life**]{.underline}. [This gives citizens something to do in response to
overwhelming structural violence. Meanwhile, by equating mass society
with that thing called \"national culture,\" these important
transpersonal linkages and intimacies are too frequently serve as
proleptic shields]{.underline}, [as ethically uncontestable legitimating
devices for sustaining the hegemonic field]{.underline}.9

#### Speaking of one's pain is sometimes necessary to change structures of oppression even if it doesn't necessarily result in justice. We should combine the AFF's demand for structural change and the neg's problematization of empathetic identification.

Too often, and almost always [in the work of legal radicals, the nation
remains sanctified as a political \"zone of privacy\"]{.underline} in
Griswold's sense: [it holds out a promise that it can relieve specific
subjects of the pain of their specificity, even as the very project of
nation formation virtually requires the public exposure of those who do
not structurally assimilate to the national norm]{.underline} (so, if
population x is relieved of the obstacles to its juridical and cultural
citizenship, a given population y will almost inevitably come to bear
the burden of surrogacy that expresses citizenship\'s status as
privilege). Fighting for justice under the law in the face of these
nonnative strategies is crucial, a tactic of necessity[. If it means
telling half-truths (that an experience of painful identity shocks a
minoritized subject) in order to change juridical norms about that kind
of subject, it still must be a good thing. But thinking that the good
life will be achieved when there is no more pain but only (your)
happiness does nothing to alter the hegemonic structures of normativity
and mourning whose saturation of the diminished expectations for liberty
in national life]{.underline} I have sketched out in this essay. [The
reparation of pain does not bring into being a just life.]{.underline}

#### Transparent movements key to create real change -- empirics

case study of how new themes were introduced into Spanish political
discourse",

This new news environment heralds a paradigm change. The scenario of
topdown information control under the journalistic and political elites
to maintain social order has shifted to a new dynamic in which chaos
prevails. Here, [surplus of information has replaced scarcity,
many-to-many news distribution channels prevail over one-to-many,
transparency prevails over opacity, accessibility over exclusivity,
interactivity over passivity, and competition over monopoly]{.underline}
(McNair, 2006). Instability and interdependence hold sway in this new
news environment, which is defined by uncertainty (Lowrey and Gade,
2011). Journalism is heading towards modified and redefined power
relations and the disappearance of existing dividing lines. The
eradication of borders is tied in with the process of digital
convergence (Jenkins, 2006; Dupagne and Garrinson, 2007; Deuze, 2007)
that is shaping the new news environment. In this context, journalism is
becoming increasingly liquid (Deuze, 2008) and operates in a more open
scenario. This new news environment has given rise to a system of hybrid
news (Chadwick, 2011), based on a blend of old and new media (Fenton,
2010). The outstanding events of 2011 have clearly revealed the new news
environment's potential to create new stories. [The Arab uprisings, mass
protests in Greece and, later on, the fast growing #Occupy movement, are
examples of this new phenomenon. In these cases, the new media have
played a prominent role in coordinating the protests, i]{.underline}n
communicating real-time images and up-to-date information, and in the
processes of contagion (Cottle, 2011; Lotan et al., 2011; Della Porta,
2011). The 15-M movement offers a paradigmatic example of this
phenomenon, as we explore below.

## 1NC - Alternatives

### 1NC -- Alt - Opacity 

#### Opacity is the only alternative to transparency. In accepting that we will never understand the Other, can we prevent Western practices of recreation and commodification. 

**Glissant, 97** a.t Glissant, Édouard, and Betsy Wing. *Poetics of
Relation*. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1997. Print.

Several years back, if 1 made the statement, \"We demand the right to
opacity,\" or argued in favor of this, whoever 1 was speaking to would
exclaim indignantly: \"Now it\'s back to barbarism! [How can you
communicate with what you don\'t understand?\"]{.underline} But in 1989,
and before very diverse audiences, when the same demand was formulated,
it aroused new interest. Who knows? Maybe, in the meanwhile, the
topicality of the question of differences (the right to difference) had
been exhausted. The theory of difference is invaluable. lt has allowed
us to struggle against the reductive thought produced, in genetics for
example, by the presumption of racial excellence or superiority. Albert
Jacquard (Éloge de la différence, Éditions du Seuil, 1978) dismantled
the mechanisms of this barbaric notion and demonstrated how ridiculous
it was to caim a \"scientific\" basis for them. (I calI the reversaI and
exasperation of self barbaric and just as inconceivable as the cruel
results of these mechanisms.) This theory has also made it possible to
take in, perhaps, not their existence but at least the rightful
entitlement to recognition of the minorities swarming throughout the
world and the defense of their status. (I call \"rightful\" the escape
far from any legitimacy anchored silently or resolutely in possession
and conquest.) [But difference itself can still contrive to reduce
things to the Transparent.]{.underline} [If we examine the process of
\"understanding\" people and ideas from the perspective of Western
thought, we discover that its basis is this requirement for
transparency]{.underline}. [In order to understand and thus accept you,
I have to measure your solidity with the ideal scale providing me with
grounds to make comparisons and, perhaps, judgments]{.underline}. I have
to reduce. Accepting differences does, of course, upset the hierarchy of
this scale. 1 understand your difference, or in other words, without
creating a hierarchy, I relate it to my norm. [I admit you to existence,
within my system. I create you afresh. -But perhaps we need to bring an
end to the very notion of a scale. Displace aIl reduction. Agree not
merely to the right to difference but, carrying this further, agree also
to the right to opacity that is not enclosure within an impenetrable
autarchy but subsistence within an irreducible singularity]{.underline}.
[Opacities can coexist and converge, weaving fabrics. To understand
these truly one must focus on the texture of the weave and not on the
nature of its components. For the time being, perhaps, give up this old
obsession with discovering what lies at the bottom of
natures.]{.underline} There would be something great and noble about
initiating such a movement, referring not to Humanity but to the
exultant divergence of humanities. [Thought of self and thought of other
here become obsolete in their duality]{.underline}. Every Other is a
citizen and no longer a barbarian. What is here is open, as much as this
there. [I would be incapable of projecting from one to the other.
This-here is the weave, and it weaves no boundaries. The right to
opacity would not establish autism; it would be the real foundation of
Relation, in freedoms]{.underline}. And now what they tell me is,
\'\'You calmIy pack your poetics into these craters of opacity and claim
to rise so serenely beyond the prodigiously elucidating work that the
\"West has accomplished, but there you go talking nonstop about this
West.\" -\"And what would you rather I talk about at the beginning, if
not this transparency whose aim was to reduce us? Because, if l don\'t
begin there, you will see me consumed with the sullen jabber of childish
refusaI, convulsive and powerless. This is where l start. As for my
identity, I'll take care of that myseIf.\" There has to be dialogue with
the West, which, moreover is contradictory in itself (usually this is
the argument raised when l talk about cultures of the One); the
complementary discourse of whoever wants to give-on-and-with must be
added to the West. And can you not see that we are implicated in its
evolution? Merely consider the hypothesis of a Christian Europe,
convinced of its legitimacy, rallied together in its reconstituted
universality, having once again, therefore, transformed its forces into
a \"universal\" value-triangulated with the technological strength of
the United States and the financial sovereignty of Japan-and you will
have some notion of the silence and indifference that for the next fifty
years (if it is possible th us to estimate) surround the problems, the
dependencies and the chaotic sufferings of the countries of the south
with nothingness. And also consider that the West itself has produced
the variables to contradict its impressive trajectory every time. This
is the way in which the West is not monolithic, and this is why it is
surely necessary that it move toward entanglement. The real question is
whether it will do so in a participatory manner or if its entanglement
will be based on old impositions. And even if we should have no
illusions about the realities, their facts already begin to change
simply by asking this question. [The opaque is not the obscure, though
it is possible for it to be so and be accepted as such. It is that which
cannot be reduced, which is the most perennial guarantee of
participation and contluence. We are far from the opacities of Myth or
Tragedy, whose obscurity was accompanied by exclusion and whose
transparency aimed at \"grasping.\"]{.underline} In this version of
understanding the verb to grasp contains the movement of hands that grab
their sUIToundings and bring them back to themselves. A gesture of
enclosure if not appropriation. [Let our understanding prefer the
gesture of giving-on-and-with that opens finally on
totality]{.underline}. At this point I need to explain what I mean by
this totality I have made so much noise about. It is the idea itself of
totality, as expressed so superbly in Western thought, that is
threatened with immobility. We have suggested that Relation is an open
totality evolving upon itself. That means that, thought of in this
manner, it is the principle of unity that we subtract from this idea.
[In Relation the whole is not the finality of its parts: for
multiplicity in totality is totally diversity. Let us say this again,
opaquely: the idea of totality alone is an obstacle to
totality]{.underline}. We have already articulated the poetic force. [We
see it as radiant-replacing the absorbing concept of unity; it is the
opacity of the diverse animating imagined transparency of Relation. The
imaginary does not bear with it the coercive requirements of idea. It
prefigures reality, without determining it a priori]{.underline}. [The
thought of opacity distracts me from absolute truths whose guardian 1
might believe myself to be]{.underline}. [Far from cornering me within
futility and inactivity, by making me sensitive to the limits of every
method, it relativizes every possibility of every action within
me]{.underline}. Whether this consists of spreading overarching general
ideas or hanging on to the concrete, the law of facts, the precision of
details, or sacrificing some apparently less important thing in the name
of efficacy, [the thought of opacity saves me from unequivocal courses
and irreversible choices]{.underline}. As far as my identity is
concerned, 1 will take care of it myself. That is, 1 shall not allow it
to become cornered in any essence; 1 shall also pay attention to not
mixing it into any amalgam. [Rather, it does not disturb me to accept
that there are places where my identity is obscure to me, and the fact
that it amazes me does not mean 1 relinquish it]{.underline}. [Human
behaviors are fractal in nature. If we become conscious of this and give
up trying to reduce such behaviors to the obviousness of a transparency,
this will]{.underline}, perhaps, [contribute to lightening their load,
as every individual begins not grasping his own motivations, taking
himself apart in this manner]{.underline}. [The rule of]{.underline}
action (what is called [ethics]{.underline} or else the ideal or just
logical relation) [would gain ground-as an obvious fact-by not being
mixed into the preconceived transparency of universaI
models.]{.underline} The rule of every action, individual or community,
would gain ground by perfecting itself through the experience of
Relation. It is the network that expresses the ethics. Every moral
doctrine is a utopia. But this morality would only become a utopia if
Relation itself had sunk into an absolute excessiveness of Chaos. The
wager is that Chaos is order and disorder, excessiveness with no
absolute, fate and evolution. [I thus am able to conceive of the opacity
of the otherfor me, without reproach for my opacity for
hirn]{.underline}. [To feel in solidarity with hirn or to build with
hirn or to like what he does, it is not necessary for me to grasp hirn.
It is not necessary to try to becorne the other (to becorne other) nor
to \"make\" hirn in rny image.]{.underline} [These projects of
transmutation-without metempsychosis-have resulted frorn the worst pre
tensions and the greatest of rnagnanirnities on the part of
West]{.underline}. They describe the fate of Victor Segalen. The death
of Segalen is not just a physiological outcorne. We recall his
confiding, in the last days of his life, about the slovenliness of his
body, whose illness he was unable to diagnose and whose dec1ine he was
unable to control. No doubt it will be known, with a list of his
syrnptoms and the help of rnedical progress, what he died of. And no
doubt the people around hirn could say he died of sorne sort of
generalized consurnption. But 1 rnyself believe that he died of the
opacity of the Other, of corning face to face with the irnpossibility of
accomplishing the transmutation that he dreamed of. Like every European
of his day, he was marked with a substantial, even if unconscious, dose
of ethnoccntrism. But he was also possessed, more than any of his
contemporaries, by this absolute and incomplete generosity that drove
him to realize himself elsewhere. He suffered from this accursed
contradiction. Unable to know that a transier into transparency ran
counter to his project and that, on the contrary, [respect for mutual
forms of opacity]{.underline} would have accomplished it, he was
heroically consumed in the impossibility of being Other. Death is the
outcome of the opacities, and this is why the idea of eleath never
leaves us. On the other hand, if an opacity is the basis for a
Legitimacy, this would be the sign of its having entered into a
political dimension. A formidable prospect, [less dangerous perhaps than
the erring ways to which so many certainties and so many clear,
so-callcel lucid truths have led]{.underline}. The excesses of these
political assurances woulel fortunately be contained by the sense not
that everything is futile but that t[here are limits to absolute
truth]{.underline}. How can one point out these limits without lapsing
into skepticism or paralysis? How can one reconcile the hard line
inherent in any politics and the questioning essential to any relation?
[Only by understanding that it is irnpossible to reduce anyone, no
matter who, to a truth he wcndd not have generated on his own. That is,
within the opacity ofhis time and place. Plato\'s city is for Plato,
Hegel\'s vision is for Hegel, the griot\'s town is for the
griot]{.underline}. [Nothing prohibits our seeing them in confluence,
without confusing them in SOlne magma or reducing them to each other.
This same opacity is also the force that drives every community: the
thing that would bring us together forever anel make us permanently
distinctive. Widespread consent to specifie opacities is the most
straightforward equivalent of nonbarbarism. We clamor for the right to
opacity for everyone.]{.underline}

### 1NC - Alt -- Black Quiet -- Non-Plan Aff

#### Black movements are delivered in a package of expressiveness that is always seen as public and centered around resistance, rather than the balance between the intentional political gesture and inwardness which is often barely acknowledged. Black quiet is a balance performance of public intimacy that reinterprets what is meant by black cultural expression. The alternative is to embrace black quiet and transcend the ballot -- providing a more accessible avenue of liberation. 

**Quashie 9,** (Kevin Everod Quashie; Kevin Quashie teaches black
cultural and literary studies and is a professor in the department of
English at Brown University, The Trouble with Publicness: Toward a
Theory of Black Quiet; African American Review, Vol. 43 No. 2/3
(Summer/Fall 2009);
<http://www.jstor.org/stable/41328610?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents>//CS)

The story of this moment has been told many times: [it was the 1968
Olympics in a volatile Mexico City, and two male athletes, both black
Americans, make an emblematic gesture during the medal ceremony for the
200-meter race. One of them, Tommie Smith, has won the race while the
other, John Carlos, was third. **As the U. S. national anthem plays,
both men punctuate the space above their heads with their black-gloved
fists, Smith raising his right hand, Carlos his left. Their salute is a
Black Power sign that protests racism and poverty, and counters the
anthem and its embracing nationalism**]{.underline}. The third man on
the podium, standing to their right, is Peter Norman, a white Australian
who won the silver medal; Norman doesn\'t elevate his fist but wears an
O. P. H. R. (Olympic Project for Human Rights) pin in solidarity with
Smith\'s and Carlos\'s protest. [The power of this moment is in its
celebrated details - **the clenched fists, the black gloves, their
shoeless feet - details that confirm a resoluteness of action**. Since
that day, **commentators have memorialized the public assertiveness of
their gesture.**]{.underline} Smith\'s and Carlos\'s bodies have become
both a precise sign of a restless decade and especially of black
resistance. [**But look again closely at the pictures from that day and
you can see something more than the certainty of public assertiveness**.
See, for example, how the severity of Smith\'s salute is balanced by the
yielding of Carlos\'s raised arm]{.underline}. Then notice how the
sharpness of their gestures is complemented by one telling detail: [that
their heads are bowed as if in prayer, that Smith, in fact, has his eyes
closed. **The effect of their bowed heads suggests intimacy, that this
very public protest is also private. There is a sublime balance between
their intentional political gesture and this sense of inwardness,** a
sublimity that is often barely acknowledged]{.underline}. The beauty of
the protest is enhanced by reading Smith and Carlos not only as soldiers
in a larger war against oppression, but also as [**two people in a
moment of deep spirituality, in prayer, as vulnerable as they are
aggressive, as pensive as they are solidly righteous**. In this reading,
what is compelling is that their humanity is on display; what we get are
the inner dimensions of their public bravery.]{.underline} As one of the
most iconic moments of the American twentieth century, Smith\'s and
Carlos\'s protest helps us explore the limits of public blackness.
[**There is no question that their action was an intentional and public
demonstration**, the most significant of the O. P. H. R.\'s attempt to
organize athletes toward a boycott of the Games. **Still, the moment
exhibits and even draws upon deep intimacy, conveying an explicit sense
of human vulnerability**]{.underline}; what is moving about seeing them
is as much the quality of graceful, lithe surrender in their postures as
it is the awareness of the politics that are at stake. Like many moments
from the civil rights movement, their protest is an exquisite balance of
what is public and what is intimate. How then can the intimacy of their
fists-in-protest be overlooked or deferred in our reading such that the
breadth of this moment is useful only for its public weight? How is it
that Smith and Carlos are largely icons of resistance, and that of all
the things we are encouraged to read in their image, vulnerability and
interiority are not among them? [Part of what hinders our capacity to
see this quality in their gestures is a general concept of blackness
that privileges public expressiveness and resistance. More specifically,
**black culture is mostly overidentified with an idea of expressiveness
that is geared toward a social audience and that has political
aim**]{.underline}; such expressiveness is the essence of black
resistance. In fact [**the idea that black culture is both expressive
and resistant is now so common that it neither seems insightful nor
requires justification**.]{.underline} Of course, [**central to this
thinking is the assumption that all expressiveness is necessarily
public**.]{.underline} This essay, then, explores the uses and limits of
black publicness [**as well as what a concept of quiet could mean to how
we think about black culture**.]{.underline} Throughout the essay, I use
the term \"quiet\" even though the noun \"quietude\" might be more
grammatically stable. The two words can mean the same thing according to
the Oxford English and American Heritage dictionaries, though quiet is
the older and more dynamic of the two, functioning as a noun, adjective,
adverb and verb. Indeed, in the most recent OED, quiet as a noun has
five entries whereas quietude holds only one. Tellingly, among the
etymologies of the terms, the OED claims that quiet can be personified -
as in \"her quiet\" - though this distinction is not noted for quietude.
This seems to indicate a greater historical and lexical flexibility in
the meaning of quiet, and to suggest the relative limitation of
quietude. Furthermore, \"[quiet\" appeals to me because it is more
colloquial. **In choosing a word to engage as a metaphor for the
expressiveness of the interior, I wanted a term that was accessible and
that had enough connotative flexibility to take on one more
meanin**g]{.underline}.2

[Oneness is the interior as a place capable of discovery, of wandering,
the risk and freedom to be had in being lost in one's self. Recent
scholarship has emphasized the importance of migration and movement as a
way to expand what racial identities mean. Concepts like postcolonial,
diaspora, transnational, and cosmopolitanism have highlighted how
movement across national boundaries produces identities that are more
fluid and complicated than commonly thought. Still, discussions of these
ideas privilege literal movement, the crossing of state borders or some
other engagement of social or political institutions; what is often
missing is a consideration of the mobility that is part of interiority,
the inevitable human capacity to wander without ever taking a
step**.**]{.underline} Such movement is apparent in Dionne Brand's poem
discussed in the previous chapter: In "Blues Spiritual," motion is in
the form of the poem, the way the lines unfurl, each offering up another
aspect of Mammy Prater. The poem itself is a moving text, as if the
narrator's sight is roaming around the photograph from detail to detail,
revisiting Prater's age and address and hands and eyes each time,
discerning something new each time. Each stanza is one long sentence,
barely punctuated and without capitalization as the words roll into each
other until they stop at the stanza's end. Brand's use of enjambment
emphasizes this coursing quality as the phrases dangle at the end of a
line, disconnected from and yearning for the words around the corner on
the next line. But **[there is]{.underline}** also **[motion in the
interior]{.underline}** that the narrator imagines for Mammy Prater,
whose cool pose represents more than a century of experience and
observation. What looks like stillness in the photograph is, in the
narrator's contemplation, a whole world of agitation. The poem is alive
with movement as the narrator searches inside her imagination to
construct the inner life of her photographic subject. And it is the
sparseness of Brand's lines that facilitates this movement, as if each
detail, revisited over and again, is a bead on a rosary, as if the poem
is an incantation. The poem wanders over Mammy Prater, giving up clarity
in exchange for the freedom of journeying. **[Perhaps wandering is the
only movement that the interior permits]{.underline}**? It is principle
of wandering that shapes Ruth Ellen Kocher's 2002 book *When the Moon
Knows You're Wandering*. A collection of twenty-eight poems that
interrogate the search for home, the book is an inquiry of the haunt and
thrill of being lost. Kocher is not yet a major poet in African-American
letters, but her consideration of identity is a brilliant exploration of
migration and movement. Her poems are full of ships and windows and even
Houdini, as well as expert use of line breaks and slant rhymes. *When
the Moon Knows You're Wandering* is an investigation of paths that are
lost and then found and then lost again, and what it might mean to
"abandon the paths of one's past." And what is striking in the
collection is how much this journey is interior and spiritual. In the
title poem, the speaker seems to catch sight of herself outside late at
night. The movement is not that of a person walking, but what she thinks
about, the interior wandering inspired by the moon's particular light:
The shadow slant of your own body somehow takes the ground in,
desperately wanting the surface of grass, rock of the familiar in the
moon's eye: light that blues your midnight form. How many years have you
been gone? And who drove you away-not a man or a stone seeming to mark
some path you run towards, but a wind that rose in the pink depth of
your lung like first breath, the exaltation of knowing you are lost. Say
your own name backwards to prove you exist, an ancient tongue that
steels the simple evening air on which you rely like Pharoh building the
tomb for years. Know your old age already in youth as if you began
wrinkled and bent to the earth with old sorrows, cold hands. You are not
the field of wars that turn the earth over and over like a thin coin,
the girl suffering ebola near a tree while her brother, coughing, digs
her grave. Go where you will. The sun rises there. The water flows.
Women wake in the middle of the night trying to remember their names,
their faces. The names of their fathers. Keep this blue light near your
heart, the dull thunder of your want tracing each step, each pace that
seems like direction. The moon knows you're wandering, even though the
road thinks you're home. (37) The poem opens with hesitation in the way
that the word "shadow" delays "slant," and how the adverbs "somehow" and
"desperately" seem to procrastinate the thought. There is cautiousness,
maybe even fear, as the narrator-speaking via direct address-sees
herself. And why not fear when one considers all the terrible histories
that are supposed to give the speaker her name? These demurrals change
course with the question, "How many years have you been gone?" which
brings forth the speaker's realization of her choice-the "first breath"
that made being lost more seductive than being familiar and at home.
Being lost-and studying this lostness-is who the speaker is, a point
that is dramatized by the excellent enjambment that closes the first
stanza and opens the second: "the exaltation in knowing//you are lost."
The stanza break turns the phrase into a statement, rather than only
being the end of sentence: lost is the speaker's clear and perpetual
name. The narrator reminds herself that she is not merely the
devastation brought by war, colonialism, and patriarchy, but that she
has "the dull thunder" of her heart and the blue light of the moon as
guideposts. "Go where you will," she urges, knowing that even with this
map of confusion, she is wandering; the road might think she is on her
way home, but the moon knows better. The poem's action is completely
interior, a journey that unfolds as the speaker thinks about who she is,
how she got here, and where might she be headed. What contributes
further to the movement is the way the narrator speaks to herself in the
second person, as if her whispers are a journey from self to self. "Go
where you will"; "you are lost," indeed. **[It is not that home has no
appeal]{.underline}** for the speaker in Kocher's poem, **[but that
wandering is a more possible practice. Home, that place of origin which
shapes a person's identity, is an essential human condition, but it is
also confinement and limitation.]{.underline}** This is the dilemma that
the speaker is figuring out as she ponders the moon's counsel: **[not
home as a static somewhere but home as a search.]{.underline}** **[In
her essay "The Site of Memory," Toni Morrison writes that "all water has
a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it
was"]{.underline}** (77). [Morrison's characterization of water is
useful to thinking about home and wandering: Here water is a wandering
body, and the excellence of its memory is qualified by the word
"trying." Water belongs to no one, seems to come from and travel to
everywhere; whatever origin water has, it carries with it-rocks and dirt
and things that mark where it has been. Water is always in movement,
even when it looks still though its aim is not about progress or
destination, just movement, the rush of energy, the exertion of force.
Water wanders. The interiority of quiet is like the wander of water, the
freedom in being lost or compassed by vagary. It is almost an exilic
condition, this quiet that is the inner life of every human
being.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Opacity

#### Modern social movements rely on communication to solve

**Rebughini 10** (Paola, University of Milan, Italy, "Critique and
social movements: Looking beyond contingency and normativity",
http://est.sagepub.com/content/13/4/459.full.pdf+html)

The space of daily life is defined both by its proximity but also -- in
an interconnected and globalized world -- by the openings and
connections with the dimensions that transcend the here and now and
immediacy of context. [The path that leads to public mobilization is
therefore that of the formation of more widespread networks in which
contact with other groups and individuals mobilizes in the same form of
resistance, and projects are made, and this leads to critical behaviour
that is locally contingently formed to be expressed i]{.underline}n a
more systematic way in the public sphere through a form of conflict that
defines individual common normative references as adversaries and
interlocutors (Castells, 2002). Over the past thirty years, research
conducted into the 'new social movements' and on the more recent phase
of [critical mobilization against neo-liberal economic globalization has
revealed that collective action that aspires to express a critique,
t]{.underline}o widen the space for democracy and individual freedom,
often grows from networks that are initially formed in the area of local
and daily life of the activists, with parallel links to normative
references that transcend the specific 'fluid' context of the
mobilization: critique of neoliberalist capitalism, the need for social
justice, environmental protection, and recognition of cultural
differences. This union between contingent and local components of
mobilization and more general references and norms has been facilitated
over the past twenty years by transitional mediated networks via the
internet and by the construction of 'virtual public spheres' (Calhoun,
2004; van de Donk et al., 2004; Langman, 2005) that refer to the idea of
a common 'Global Civil Society' that communicates via websites, blogs,
alternative media, and continental and global forums. Even i[f
communicative aspects -- initially cited by Adorno even before Habermas
-- have always been central to mobilization (]{.underline}progressive
but also reactionary) and in the construction of a public sphere, the
present internet-based mobilizations and cyber-activism have profoundly
transformed the way in which critique can emerge within the public
sphere. As a consequence[, even though every form of mobilization is
based on forms of media communication, the nature of this media has a
fundamental role, and the internet has allowed the unprecedented rapid
and capillary distribution of critical issues even if they have often
been packaged and become sectorial.]{.underline}

#### Opacity has no effect on the success of a movement

**Rebughini 10** (Paola, University of Milan, Italy, "Critique and
social movements: Looking beyond contingency and normativity",
http://est.sagepub.com/content/13/4/459.full.pdf+html)

The frame of normative references, 'consensual truths' and symbolic
resources constituted by the [contemporary communicative networks of
mobilization presents a broad horizon of sense for protests and critical
forms that are tied to a specific context and its
constraints.]{.underline} The networks also contribute to the creation
of collective identities that 'emerge within an interactive process in
which social networks define their values and the meaning of their
action' (Langman, 2005: 57). In this sense, [local and contingent
mobilizations have been able to base their legitimacy, inserting
themselves into a frame of normative references and of similar
mobilizations that by now have a transnational character.]{.underline}
Naturally these references do not function in an automatic way, we often
witness the reflexive appropriation -- diversified according to contexts
-- of a general framework that is based on the recognition of
fundamental human rights -- such as global justice -- but also on an
anti-liberalist and anti-militarist standpoint. In this sense, [**the
success of critique expressed by a movement cannot be measured solely
through the numerical visibility of a demonstration on public soil**,
but also and above all by the quantity of information that the
mobilization is able to circulate and by the changes in daily practice
that it is able to provoke.]{.underline} IT webs have anyway played a
propulsive role that has enormously facilitated the circulation of
information and expressions of critique, even if the
transnationalization of mobilization or the existence of more general
frames of reference also existed in the past. Today [organizational
networks exist that are capable of mobilizing initiatives and people on
a trans-continental scale; networks are thus plural, inclusive and
geometrically variable, they tend to be anti-hierarchical and are
perceived as a space for the experimentation of forms of participative
and deliberative democracy.]{.underline} The extension of these networks
and their speed of action have also facilitated [the circulation of
references of validity on which actions and protests are based and upon
which the legitimacy of critique is based.]{.underline} As a
consequence, the spread of local actions, the pluralism of the issues in
play and the contingency of critical expressions have been compensated
with the construction of a common normative frame of reference, even if
not unified and marked by old tensions between references to justice and
those to autonomy and between appeals to difference and those to
equality.
