IN POLITICAL science, the "deep state" concept has been used to describe
politics in countries like Turkey and Pakistan. In these places,
deep-state theorists claim shadowy networks engage in extralegal and
illegal activities, including bombings and assassinations, to advance
their parochial interests or protect their vision of the regime. Given
this context, the term "deep state" surely doesn't fit an established
liberal democracy like the United States. And yet "[deep state" language
has been adopted by legitimate commentators in America,]{.underline}
trying to analyze our politics today. While usages vary,
[the]{.underline} basic [idea behind these deep-state arguments is that
well-placed elements inside the permanent national-security
bureaucracy,]{.underline} and those tightly connected to them in
industry and think tanks, [have been able to dominate---or even
control---U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. They allegedly do so
**[through]{.underline}** various mechanisms, including inside and
outside pressure; [**control of**]{.underline} vast **[resources and
capabilities; leveraging information]{.underline}** asymmetries to their
advantage[; **engaging in threat inflation**]{.underline} and selective
leaking; and replicating, reinforcing and policing the ideas
**[and]{.underline}** culture within key institutions to produce [**a
"groupthink" mentality**.]{.underline} Some consider secrecy an
essential component of the deep state. For example, ABC News, in a 2017
poll about the existence and power of the deep state, defined it as
"military, intelligence and government officials who try to secretly
manipulate government policy." But the most cogent theories posit that
the deep state is operating in the open and without any central
direction. The end result of all these machinations? According to
deep-state theorists, the preferences of elected officials and political
appointees are subverted, undermining the will of the people and our
republican form of government[. To prove their case, theorists point to
the continuity of our foreign policy despite new leaders taking office
with an alleged commitment to change.]{.underline} The idea of a deep
state running the show in foreign policy is not solely a Trump-era
phenomenon. Mike Lofgren, a career congressional staffer, argued in 2014
that there was "a hybrid entity of public and private institutions
ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out,
connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state
whose leaders we choose." Tufts University professor Michael Glennon
introduced his "double government" concept during the Obama presidency.
Glennon claims that Obama's policies resembled those of the Bush
administration (despite Obama's alleged preferences to the contrary)
because there was a second government calling the shots: "A de facto
directorate of several hundred managers sitting atop dozens of military,
diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies, from the
Department of Homeland Security to the National Reconnaissance Office,
has come to dominate national security policy, displacing the authority
not only of Congress but of the courts and the presidency as well." [But
is this all true? Is there a "deep state"]{.underline} (or a less
sinister-sounding "double government") dominating national-security
policy---the wishes of presidents, other officials and the people be
damned? **[In short, no. The notion that elected officials are trapped,
rendered impotent, their preferences subverted by bureaucrats and their
allies, is simply inaccurate.]{.underline}** This isn't to say that
permanent networks within the government don't matter. But as critics of
the old bureaucratic-politics paradigm (such as Stephen Krasner and
Robert Art) argued, [presidents and shared mind-sets are strong
determinants of foreign-policy decisions]{.underline}, even if faced by
a willful bureaucracy with its own agenda. When presidents have strong
preferences about an issue, they win by devoting attention and expending
political capital in the service of their goal. President Obama
prevailed on big issues that he focused on and that important players in
the alleged deep state opposed, including drawing down in Iraq, avoiding
deep involvement in Syria and negotiating the JCPOA. In the case of
Libya, it was not the deep state but rather key members of Obama's own
national-security team (Clinton, Rice and Power) who pushed the
president to intervene. As Krasner reminds us, "[The President chooses
most of the important players and sets the rules" for
decisionmaking.]{.underline} This includes, importantly, selecting the
individuals who are able to "whisper" in the president's ear. On Libya,
Obama got the wrong whispers---but they came from the people he chose,
rather than a nefarious deep state. And he could have listened to other
voices. [Had Obama really wanted to shift from a primacist grand
strategy to one of realism and restraint, he would not have surrounded
himself with so many top officials representing the status
quo]{.underline}. [Likewise]{.underline}, if President
[Trump]{.underline} strongly preferred change, he [could have selected
advisors less committed to the same general vision as his
predecessors.]{.underline} Thus it is no surprise that there has been so
much policy continuity (to take just two examples, see Afghanistan and
the new National Security Strategy) despite Trump's campaign rhetoric.

\"Industry Takeaways From The Defense Industrial Base Report,\" Law360,
https://www.law360.com/articles/1092382/industry-takeaways-from-the-defense-industrial-base-report+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us

[Expert Analysis]{.underline} Industry Takeaways From The Defense
Industrial Base Report Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for
trade and manufacturing policy, recently [offered in a]{.underline} New
York Times [op-ed that]{.underline} "\[[a\] strong manufacturing base is
critical to both economic prosperity and national
defense."\[]{.underline}1\] [The]{.underline} Trump administration's
[maxim that "economic security is national security" is rooted
in]{.underline} several government initiatives, ranging from large-scale
policy reforms (like renegotiating the North American Free Trade
Agreement\[2\] and strengthening the so-called "Buy American Laws"\[3\])
to more granular contracting procedures (like the U.S. Department of
Defense's proposed changes to commercial item contracting\[4\] and
increased scrutiny of security across [all levels of defense supply
chains]{.underline}).\[5\] Business leaders should therefore pay close
attention to the government's long-awaited interagency assessment of the
manufacturing and defense industrial base, which recently was made
available in unclassified form.\[6\] [The report]{.underline} was
commissioned by Executive Order 13806, which [described "\[s\]trategic
support for]{.underline} a vibrant domestic manufacturing sector, a
[vibrant defense industrial base,]{.underline} and resilient supply
cha[i]{.underline}n[s]{.underline}" as "[a significant national
priority.]{.underline}"\[7\] The Department of Defense served as the
lead agency coordinating the report, in partnership with the White
House's Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. Throughout the
140-page report, [the]{.underline} interagency [task force]{.underline}
identifies myriad threats, risks and gaps in the country's manufacturing
and defense industrial base, and [concludes that **"\[a\]ll facets of
the manufacturing and defense industrial base are currently under
threat**]{.underline}, at a time [**when**]{.underline} strategic
competitors and **[revisionist powers appear to be growing in strength
and capability]{.underline}**." To address these concerns, the task
force lays out a methodology, diagnosis and framework for policy
recommendations and gives the government significant flexibility in
crafting responses. The report recommends --- and we expect the
president to issue --- a follow-on executive order directing action on
those responses. That creates an opportunity for industry to participate
in shaping the major implementing policies and regulations that are
coming. Overview of the Report **[A key benefit of the report is the
clear]{.underline}**, **[detailed description of the task force's
methodology]{.underline}**. This provides a road map for industry
partners, particularly those in the supply chain below the large prime
contractor level, to offer targeted inputs and comments. [The task force
categorized the relevant "sectors" of the]{.underline} manufacturing and
[d]{.underline}efense [i]{.underline}ndustrial [b]{.underline}ase. These
[include "traditional" sectors]{.underline} like aircraft, munitions and
shipbuilding, [and "cross-cutting" sectors like electronics,
cybersecurity, and the U.S. workforce]{.underline}. [Working groups then
identified the "macro forces"]{.underline} on those sectors [that
"represent the root causes of]{.underline} ten [risk]{.underline}
archetypes." Macro [forces include]{.underline} those that are
self-inflicted ("U.S. government business practices" and "sequestration
and **[uncertainty of U.S. government spending]{.underline}**"), [and
those that arise from external actors and market forces ("industrial
policies of competitor nations]{.underline}" and "**[decline of U.S.
manufacturing capability and capacity").]{.underline}** The resulting
"risk archetypes" include threats like sole sources, single points of
failure, erosion of domestic human capital and infrastructure, and
foreign dependency. The report then summarizes its four overarching
findings: 1. The impacts and risks primarily affect "sub-tiers" of the
supply chains, rather than the major defense prime contractors. 2. "A
surprising level of foreign dependence on competitor nations exists."
The report highlights crucial opportunities to leverage capacity and
capability of allied nations. 3. Human capital challenges are pervasive,
including the decline of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics, and manufacturing trade skills among American workers. 4.
Critical capabilities are moving offshore, both to capture foreign
market share and to take advantage of cost-savings opportunities. The
appendices to the report include various case studies supporting the
task force's assessment of each sector, highlighting the challenges
currently faced by the manufacturing and defense industrial base. The
report concludes with a "blueprint for action," summarizing current and
future efforts that are "the groundwork for important actions,
mitigations, and ongoing monitoring that will result in America's
ability to continue supporting a secure, robust, resilient, and ready
industrial base."

(Samantha Cohen is a quantitative analyst for the RAND corporation with
a master's in economics and Andrew Hunter is a senior fellow in the
International Security Program and Director of the Defense-Industrial
Initiatives Group at CSIS. He focuses on issues affecting the industrial
base including emerging technologies, sequestration, acquisition policy,
and industrial policy., 10-11-2018, \"The Year of the Industrial Base,\"
Center for Strategic International Studies,
[https://www.csis.org/analysis/year-industrial-base
//](https://www.csis.org/analysis/year-industrial-base%20//) NC)

[The industrial base has been a clear focus of national security policy
since the start of the current administration. Policy]{.underline} and
strategy documents [issued]{.underline} in 2018 [concretely articulate
the **economy as**]{.underline} a strategic asset whose importance to
national security is [**underpinned by the state of the defense
industrial base.** While the strategic importance of a strong and
resilient industrial base has long been recognized, it currently faces
threats from the residual effects of Budget Control Act spending caps
and sequestration and from state-directed foreign competition in key
technology sectors.]{.underline} For instance, a CSIS study showed the
pervasive impact of the Budget Control Act on the industrial base,
finding that the number of vendors working directly for the Department
of Defense (DoD) fell by 20 percent. [What impacts these declines had on
lower levels of the supply chain remains uncertain]{.underline}. [The
highly-anticipated findings from the first post-sequestration review of
the health of the industrial base were publicly released last
Friday]{.underline}. [The review highlights the damage done at lower
tiers of the supply chain, identifying approximately **300 specific
vulnerabilities among critical suppliers**]{.underline}. Addressing
these vulnerabilities will be one of DoD's critical jobs next year.
Congress set the table in the John S. McCain National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2019 by providing the necessary tools to
address weaknesses in the industrial base and leverage the U.S. economy
as a strategic national security asset. The administration has used a
variety of vehicles to promote its support for the industrial base.
Executive Order 13806 required the Secretary of Defense, in concert with
an interagency team, to assess the capacity and resiliency of the
defense industrial base and how it can be strengthened. The National
Defense and Security Strategies (NDS/NSS) emphasized inter-state
strategic competition as the primary threat to national security,
highlighting that China's pursuit of modernization in technology and
their military threatens U.S. national security that has historically
been achieved through preeminence in these fields. To counter this
threat, the strategy documents proposed that the United States pursues
multilateralism through strengthening existing relationships and seeks
new partners at the same time that it protects and rejuvenates the
domestic economy by guarding it against competitors and intellectual
property theft. The National Security Presidential Memorandum regarding
U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer policy, issued in April of this year,
complemented this theme by promising executive branch support for
proposed arms transfers that are in the national security interest. By
simplifying and clarifying the procedures and regulations required for
arms transfers, the administration promised to increase the
opportunities for U.S. companies to sell arms abroad. [The findings from
the industrial base review largely focus on these more strategic
concerns.]{.underline} For instance, [the report states that the United
States worryingly relies on China for rare earth minerals that many
high-tech systems depend on]{.underline}. Furthermore, the review notes
[the emergence of Chinese investments in U.S. technology startups as a
threat to national security]{.underline}. And it highlights the
potential for China to threaten U.S. national security by inserting
malicious hardware and software into the many technology supply chains
originating in China, an act which could have potentially devastating
effects such as compromising critical infrastructure. This risk was
highlighted in a recent [Bloomberg]{.underline} article that [found
evidence of Chinese infiltration into U.S. tech giants including Amazon
and Apple through the insertion of a malicious chip into a major supply
chain for commercial servers]{.underline}. At the same time, the
[industrial base]{.underline} review recognizes that defense trade
**[also brings many benefits, including]{.underline}** the potential to
**[leverage]{.underline}** the economies [of partners and allies
through]{.underline} arrangements such as the national technology
industrial base ([NTIB]{.underline}), [which provides the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [with greater access to the
tech]{.underline}nology of friendly nations. A policy is only as good as
the tools provided to implement it, and the FY 2019 NDAA provides
several new tools necessary for implementing the industrial-base focused
policies and strategies of this past year. In light of the industrial
base review's findings that foreign dependency, reliance on a sole
source, and diminishing manufacturing sources and material sources are
likely to threaten the industrial base, the FY 2019 NDAA provides legal
and regulatory guidance for countering these threats to the
technological capacity and general health of the industrial base. For
instance, Section 843 authorizes a pilot program to "test the
feasibility and reliability of using machine-vision technologies to
determine the authenticity and security of microelectronic parts in
weapon systems," bolstering the DoD's ability to identify compromised
infrastructure that utilizes materials sourced internationally. Section
845 requires the Secretary of Defense to collaborate with interagency
colleagues to report on the health of the defense electronics industrial
base. The report is required to investigate current and planned
commercial partnerships and describe the electronics supply chain
requirements to meet the goals of the 2018 NDS. Section 1793 calls for a
review and report on key national security technology capability
advantages, competitions, and gaps between the United States and other
nations. The FY 2019 NDAA also provides tools necessary for pursuing the
administration's new arms transfer policy. Section 1756 calls for the
Secretary of Defense to strive toward implementing "an accurate,
consistent, and timely evaluation and processing of licenses or other
requests for authorization to export, reexport, or in-country transfer
items" in under 30 days from the original license request. Similarly,
Section 1751---otherwise known as the Export Controls Act of
2018---requires export control policy that is "transparent, predictable,
and timely, has the flexibility to be adapted to address new threats in
the future, and allows seamless access to and sharing of export control
information," between U.S. agencies. More industrial-base targeted
provisions include Section 844 that allows NTIB firms to apply to be
considered for the status of a required provider for important items of
supply to DoD. Additionally, Section 846 fortifies the national security
innovation base by building off of the last administration's efforts
towards creating manufacturing consortiums. These consortiums would be
designated as defense manufacturing communities that DoD has the
authority to invest in for achieving critical skills, improving
facilities, executing research and development, and promoting small
business. Section 1261 requires the president to formulate a whole of
government strategy for long-term strategic competition with China by
March 1, 2019. Finally, Section 885 mandates the Secretary of Defense to
"develop a process and procedures for limiting foreign access to
technology through contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other
transactions, when such limitation is in the interest of national
security." The industrial base review coupled with policy and strategy
documents gives DoD and its inter-agency network a great deal of
homework for the upcoming year. While it is clear that the DoD will be
rigorously working toward supporting and reinvigorating industries as
well as deeply engaging with its partners and allies, DoD will have to
overcome the challenge of the competing interests associated with these
two core strategic goals. Protecting and strengthening the industrial
base through re-sourcing critical materials and technologies
domestically and tightening regulations to safeguard essential
intellectual property---as federal agencies and industries are
simultaneously encouraged to deepen their relationships with allies and
partners---may generate some inherent tensions. Simultaneously pursuing
these two goals will be tricky for government and industry alike.
Educating the acquisition workforce on how to achieve these goals will
require the issuance of careful regulatory guidance in the upcoming year
in order to delineate how to best navigate this environment and ensure
that strategic U.S. interests are efficiently met.

Unlike Gilbert, my account of collective belief is not intended to
capture some everyday concept, for I do not share the view of many
analytic philosophers that the goal of philosophy is just to describe
ordinary concepts. I think that philosophy, like science, should be
revisionary, looking to develop concepts with greater explanatory
potential than everyday ones (Thagard 2009[). In particular, the goal of
social epistemology is]{.underline} not [to]{.underline} capture
ordinary ways of talking about collective representations, but rather to
[develop modes of thinking about social dimensions of
knowledge]{.underline} [that have greater explanatory breadth and depth
than ordinary understanding]{.underline}. Like other areas of
epistemology and ethics, [social epistemology should also have important
normative implications,]{.underline} [pointing to ways in which the
social processes of developing knowledge can be improved.]{.underline}
**[Both economics and science studies have crucial normative
applications. Economists attend to crises not only to understand what
happened but also to try to figure out how financial crashes can be
avoided or ameliorated.]{.underline}** [Given the amount of misery
produced by]{.underline} unemployment, poverty, and other [economic
misfortunes]{.underline}, **[understanding economic crises has a strong
ethical dimension]{.underline}**. Economists and [policy makers must
attempt to draw lessons about the mechanisms inside]{.underline} and
between individuals, banks, and governments [**in order to acquire
knowledge about how to prevent future disasters**. Similarly, the point
of the social epistemology of science is]{.underline} not just to
describe how scientific knowledge grows as the result of social and
individual processes but also [to establish new norms for increasing the
growth of knowledge]{.underline} by enhancing collaboration and other
social processes (see, for example, Thagard 1999; Goldman 1999). This
paper has been concerned more narrowly with a particular case of
scientific explanation, the economic crisis of 2008. I have shown how
economists like Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz discuss the events
leading to this crisis in terms of collective representations, including
beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions. I have argued, however, that
these discussions should not be taken as literally true, but rather as
metaphorical pointers to a whole complex of multilevel interacting
mechanisms[. To understand economic crises and other social phenomena,
we need to work out the complex interrelationships among processes that
operate at many levels, including molecular, neural, and psychological
as well as social.]{.underline}

I'm normally leery of the pervasive threat inflation that tends to
dominate discussions of foreign policy. Because the United States is so
strong and in such a favorable geopolitical location, [pundits and
policymakers have to pretend the sky is falling to justify bigger
military budgets and convince the public to keep meddling in distant
lands. And whether the threat is falling dominos,]{.underline} "creeping
Sharia," the "axis of evil," or even "violent extremism," [the actual
threat these faraway dangers pose is usually exaggerated. **Right now,
however, we're at a moment when**]{.underline} I think **[genuine
concern is warranted]{.underline}**. This is not to say that we're on
the brink of a major war, let alone a global clash of great powers. But
[flammable material is accumulating and it is hard to have high
confidence in the political leadership in several key countries
**(including here in the United States**]{.underline}). We would all do
well to take stock of the global order: Is the world more secure than it
was a year ago? Specifically, is the risk of war increasing or
decreasing? Is the danger of a serious economic crisis higher or lower?
Are the institutional arrangements and norms that help smooth and
resolve conflicts of interest and enhance the prospects for
international cooperation more or less robust than they were in June
2016? With apologies to the late Sergio Leone, I'd group recent global
developments under three headings: the good, the bad, and the ugly. The
Good Before descending into fatalistic depression --- we'll get to that
soon enough --- let's start with the upside. Despite all the worrisome
headlines and a recent slight uptick, the level of conflict between
human beings is still at historic lows, and the likelihood that you will
die a violent death is vastly lower than it was at nearly all other
moments in human history. Nor have the number of low-level conflicts
increased significantly over the past year or so, even if one takes the
deteriorating situation in the Middle East into account. Although the
Islamic State and other terrorist groups have been able to direct or
inspire terrorist attacks in more places, the actual risk from terrorism
remain relatively low outside active conflict zones such as Syria or
Iraq, especially when compared with more prosaic and familiar hazards.
Even now, the odds that a European or American will be harmed in a
terrorist attack are vanishingly small. Such encouraging trends are no
guarantee of continued tranquility, of course, and one could even argue
that complacency could make a spiral into war more likely. But we should
still be grateful the world is more peaceful than it was in earlier eras
and try to draw the right lessons from that observation. At a minimum,
the major powers haven't fought each other directly for over 70 years,
and making sure that continues to be the case remains a critical task.
There are other encouraging straws in the wind as well. For the moment,
voters in France, the Netherlands, and Austria have rejected the
xenophobic nationalism of politicians like Geert Wilders and Marine Le
Pen, and instead embraced the more inclusive and forward-looking visions
of leaders like Emmanuel Macron. The Islamic State's self-proclaimed
"caliphate" is now headed for the dustbin of history, and while this
won't eliminate the problem of violent extremism, it is a useful step
forward. The peace agreement ending Colombia's long civil war is holding
--- at least so far --- and the war in Ukraine has settled down into a
mostly frozen conflict that seems unlikely to escalate. Moreover,
Russia's continued efforts to manipulate or influence domestic politics
in nearby democracies may be backfiring, while Russia's own long-term
power potential continues to decline and popular protests there are
increasing. T[he EU is in its fifth straight year of economic
recovery,]{.underline} despite of the uncertainties surrounding the
Brexit process, and [European, American, and Japanese publics are
increasingly upbeat about economic issues]{.underline}. And (fingers
crossed), so far U.S. President Donald Trump hasn't done much to trigger
a trade war (though he still might). **[I wouldn't say the glass is
half-full,]{.underline}** but at least it's not completely empty. The
Bad That's the good news. If you're looking for things to worry about,
alas, one doesn't have to look far. [In Asia, North Korea's nuclear and
missile capabilities in defiance of global opinion]{.underline}
(surprise, surprise), [and Trump's naive hope that China
would]{.underline} ignore its own interests and [somehow persuade
Pyongyang to do what Trump wanted has been exposed as the pipe dream it
always was.]{.underline} But this leaves the United States and its Asian
allies with no attractive options, and only the "least-bad" choice of
reengaging with a country that just killed a U.S. citizen over an
alleged purloined poster. Islamist movements appear to be gaining
strength in Indonesia and threatening that country's prior atmosphere of
tolerance, and the Philippine government's wars on drugs and terrorism
are wreaking a fearsome human cost with little to show for it. And
Trump's bromance with Chinese President Xi Jinping has done nothing to
slow Beijing's efforts to alter the territorial status quo in the South
China Sea. All things considered, it's hard to see conditions in Asia as
safer now than they were a year ago. [The same gloomy conclusion applies
to the Middle East, only more so]{.underline}. The Islamic State may
soon be a thing of the past --- at least in terms of holding territory
--- but [the exceedingly complex, multifaceted, and interrelated
conflicts in Yemen, Syria/Iraq, and between Qatar and Saudi Arabia
create much more potential for trouble than was present back in
2016]{.underline}. The impending defeat of the Islamic State has
intensified its opponents' efforts to control its former territory, with
outside powers ramping up their involvement while diplomatic efforts
languish. U.S. military involvement has risen steadily --- with scant
input from Congress or the American public --- [and U.S. aircraft
recently shot down Iranian drones and a Syrian fighter
plane.]{.underline} The latter act [prompted Moscow to issue a direct
warning against further U.S. attacks]{.underline} and to suspend the
communications channel created to minimize the risk of an inadvertent
clash between U.S. and Russian forces. And to make matters worse, [an
emboldened Saudi Arabia is continuing its brutal military
campaign]{.underline} in Yemen [while]{.underline} simultaneously trying
to force [neighboring Qatar]{.underline} to silence Al Jazeera, [sever
its contacts with Iran]{.underline}, and basically accept Saudi
predominance. Maybe you can see a silver lining in all these
developments, but I can't[. The worst case for the United States would
be involvement in another big Middle East war arising]{.underline} "from
sheer incompetence and incoherence rather than by design," as Jim Lobe
and Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio put it. Meanwhile, it's "déjà vu all
over again" [in Afghanistan]{.underline}, with [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates about to [reverse Barack Obama's drawdown and send
more troops back into an unwinnable war.]{.underline} Exactly why this
step is in America's national interest remains unclear, and at least
nobody is trying to pretend that this decision (which Trump has
delegated to Secretary of Defense James Mattis) is going to produce
anything that might be termed "victory." [Instead, in a disturbing echo
of the Indochina war, the United States is operating a new version of
the "stalemate machine," doing just enough to not lose]{.underline}. We
know we can't win; at this point we can't break even, yet neither
Democrats nor Republicans will let us out of the game. Last but not
least, the institutional underpinnings of the present international
system continue to fray. The importance of such institutions is
sometimes exaggerated, but even hard-nosed realists understand that
strong institutions can facilitate cooperation among like-minded states
and lend greater predictability to important international
relationships. [NATO is intact but weaker than it was a year ago, and
doubts about the U.S. role in Asia have been rising following Trump's
renunciation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and his erratic responses
to events in Korea and the Philippines.]{.underline} Instead of being
able to count on help from close allies in most circumstances, today the
United States faces a Germany whose leader wants Europe to "chart its
own course," and a Canada whose foreign minister says "International
relationships that had seemed immutable for 70 years are being called
into question," adding that America's decisions are forcing Canada "to
set our own clear and sovereign course." Such sentiments are not a sign
of the apocalypse, but they do not herald easier ties between the United
States and its most important neighbors and allies. The Ugly [These
developments would be worrisome enough if we had a surplus of gifted and
farsighted strategists at the helm of the world's major
powers]{.underline}, the modern-day equivalents of Franklin Roosevelt,
George Marshall, Konrad Adenauer, or Charles de Gaulle. Heck, at this
point I'd take Maggie Thatcher, Zbigniew Brzezinski, James Baker,
Jacques Chirac, and any number of past leaders who made some big
mistakes but also got a number of big things right and did not enter
public service largely either to fleece the public or to gratify their
own egos. What do we see instead? [In the United Kingdom, two successive
prime ministers have inexplicably committed remarkably maladroit acts of
self-defenestration]{.underline}. The first was David Cameron, who ended
his political career by pledging to hold a referendum on leaving the
European Union (which he opposed) and then losing. The second is Theresa
May, who called a snap election earlier this month that cost her party
its Parliamentary majority. [France]{.underline} has gone from the
"bling-bling" of Nicolas Sarkozy to the hapless Francois Hollande and
[is now betting on the as-yet untried Macron.]{.underline} [Italy hasn't
had effective political leadership since]{.underline} --- oh, I don't
know, Garibaldi? Recep Erdogan in Turkey has proven to be extremely
adept at consolidating power and extremely bad at actually running the
country, and there are equally depressing examples of incompetent
leadership in Brazil, Afghanistan, Poland, and throughout the Middle
East. But the United States is determined not to be beaten in this
competition of political incompetence. If the consequences were not
potentially so dire, the Trump administration's collective ineptitude
would be a great source of comic relief. I'm not talking about
controversial policy decisions about which reasonable people might
disagree (such as the pros and cons of giving regional military
commanders greater authority over operations in their respective areas),
I'm talking about foreign-policy actions that seem inspired more by the
Keystone Cops or Three Stooges than by Clausewitz, Kennan, or Sun Tzu.
Indeed, only six months into Trump's presidency, it's becoming hard to
keep track of all the squirm-inducing moments. There was the brief sage
of Trump's initial national security advisor, Mike Flynn, who lasted in
his job a mere 25 days, or the appointment of self-styled "terrorism
expert" Sebastian Gorka. There was Trump's bizarre speech at CIA
headquarters the day after he was inaugurated, in which he rambled on
about the crowd size at his inauguration ceremony and complained about
media coverage. There was the "armada" he said was heading toward North
Korea when it was actually steaming in the opposite direction, and his
on-again, off-again, on-again attitude toward NATO and Article 5. There
were the press releases, tweets, and announcements that misspelled the
names of foreign leaders and the mini-crisis that erupted when Trump
announced South Korea should pay for the THAAD missile-defense system
that the U.S. had insisted be deployed there. (National Security Advisor
H.R. McMaster had to call his South Korean counterpart and walk that one
back, but the damage had already been done.) And then there's Trump's
weird decision to gut the State Department (apparently with the full
support of his secretary of state) and to assign sensitive diplomatic
tasks to his son-in-law, despite the latter's complete lack of
foreign-policy experience and checkered business career. And don't even
get me started about Trump & Co.'s handling of relations with Russia and
Kushner's amateurish attempts to create some sort of backchannel to
Moscow. With a record like this to defend, it's no wonder the White
House is trying to keep the press and the public in the dark about what
it's doing. Why does any of this matter[? Because the greatest
achievements of U.S. foreign policy since World War II has been its
ability, when it chose, to keep wars from breaking out or to end them
quickly when they did occur]{.underline}. As I've explained before, a
peaceful world is very much in the U.S. national interest, given how
secure and well-off the United States already is. [The combination of
military strength and skilled diplomacy helped keep the peace in Europe
and in much of Asia throughout the Cold War, and often]{.underline} (but
not always) [played a stabilizing role in the Middle East.]{.underline}
It required not just credible military power, but also politicians who
understood how the world worked and what the interests of others were,
had a clear sense of America's own interests, and were sufficiently
consistent that others could count on them to do what they had promised.
By contrast, America's biggest foreign-policy failures occurred when
U.S. leaders started wars on our own (Iraq, 2003), escalated them for no
good reason (Vietnam, 1965), or turned a blind eye to simmering
conflicts and missed opportunities for peace (Korea in 1950 and the
Middle East in 1966-67, 1971-72, and 1982). And many of these errors
arose from impulsive and ignorant leaders who knew relatively little
about the situations they were trying to manage. [Today, the United
States isn't disengaging from world affairs or adopting a new and
well-thought out grand strategy]{.underline}, such as offshore
balancing, **[but it is hardly acting as a clear or consistent defender
of peace and the status quo]{.underline}**. On the contrary, Washington
is still trying to determine the future fate of Afghanistan, still
hoping for regime change in several countries it doesn't like,
encouraging its proxies in the Middle East to escalate their local
quarrels, and using increasing levels of military power to try to solve
problems --- such as terrorism and insurgency --- whose roots are
essentially political. **[The United States has pretty much abandoned
its role as a potential mediator in lots of potential
hotspots,]{.underline}** and it would be naive to expect all of these
conflicts will to simmer down on their own. If the past 25 years have
taught us anything, it is that few foreign-policy problems can be solved
simply by blowing things up. The United States is still unsurpassed at
that sort of thing, but the real challenge is devising political
solutions to conflicts once the guns have fallen silent. We've been
singularly bad at this in recent decades, and Trump's disdain for
diplomacy and efforts to gut the State Department will just impair us
even more. The result is looking like the worst of both worlds:
[The]{.underline} United States is still engaged in most of the world's
trouble spots, but [the ship of state is now being steered by an
inexperienced skipper lacking accurate charts, an able crew, or even a
clear destination. I don't know about you, but that situation doesn't
make me feel safer, either.]{.underline}

### K2 Policy Reform 

#### Discourse of economic decline is crucial to [successful policy reform]{.underline} --- their authors criticize our reps [out of context]{.underline}

**McConnell, 9** - Professor of Government at the University of
Strathclyde, UK (Allan, \"Framing the Global Economic Downturn: Crisis
rhetoric and the politics of recessions on JSTOR\", No Publication, 20\
[Crises present extraordinary challenges]{.underline} for political
[leaders]{.underline}. [Amid]{.underline} threats, [uncertainty and
urgency]{.underline}, [they must]{.underline} undertake a number of
tasks, such as making sense of what is going on and
[articulat]{.underline}ing [its **depth and scope to a wider
public**]{.underline}. I would argue, however, that [such tasks are
means towards ends, rather than ends in themselves]{.underline}. [The
goal]{.underline} of leaders [is to successfully manage a
crisis]{.underline}. After all, [who would want to fail]{.underline},
except as an interim measure towards a longer-term success? [The focus
of this book is 'framing']{.underline} and therefore we need to ask: if
leaders strive to produce frames in order to successfully manage a
crisis then [what does a 'successful' frame look like]{.underline} from
their perspective[?]{.underline} The clues are already in Chapters 1 and
2, but I want to draw them out: • [Crisis-management frame for political
success: a frame that is intended to ensure political survival and
protect]{.underline} or even enhance [reputation]{.underline}. •
[Crisis-management frame for policy success: a frame that is intended to
steer policy down a desired track]{.underline}, whether it be
continuity, change or a combination of both. Of course, it is not
possible to get inside the minds of leaders to prove these assumptions.
Even interviews have limitations. A large element of crisis leadership
is based on instinct rather than a rational appraisal of objectives and
all the possible means of achieving them (Flin 1996). Nevertheless, [it
is a **relatively straightforward task** to look at the global financial
crisis case studies and attribute, with a high degree of plausibility,
'**success' motives**.]{.underline} For example, in terms of the
political game, the initial 'business-as-usual' frame (type-1) of
Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, could be read as an attempt to
play down the crisis, while playing up his credentials as an experienced
economist who was strongly placed to lead the country at the forthcoming
election. This frame suited his quest to hold onto office and enhance
his reputation. With regard to the policy game, New Zealand Prime
Minister Helen Clark's [framing o]{.underline}f the [crisis]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} both [threat and opportunity]{.underline} (type-2 and
type-3) [can]{.underline} be read as an attempt to [pave the way for
**policy reform.**]{.underline} The fact that an election was looming
illustrates that a striving for political success can be contingent on
policy success---in this case, the need to demonstrate that the existing
Labour-led government was best placed to manage the global financial
crisis. Importantly, no frame is guaranteed to succeed. [Some strategies
are riskier than others]{.underline}. [Risks relate to the likelihood
that goals will not be met (]{.underline}Drennan and McConnell 2007).
**[Context is crucial]{.underline}** to assessments of risk (Douglas
1992; Althaus 2008). The same activity---walking slowly across the
road---is low or even no risk when the road is empty, but high risk if
done on a busy motorway. Leadership framing of crisis is little
different. [A frame can be at **low risk of failing to achieve 'success'
in one context**, but that same frame can be **high risk in
another.**]{.underline} [We need to think]{.underline}, therefore,
[about 'context']{.underline}. Context can be all manner of phenomena
such as culture, time, political mood and economic activity. For the
purposes of focusing on framing, I consider context to be the existence
or otherwise of strong and credible counter-frames to those articulated
by leaders. [If leaders strive for political success by projecting a
frame that is intended to ensure their political survival and protect
and even enhance their reputation then---all things being equal---a
lower risk context is when there is no strong and credible counter-frame
in existence.]{.underline} Clearly, [this is typically the case in the
early sense-making and meaning-making stages of a crisis when leaders
need to be out in the public sphere with statements on issues of crisis
severity, causes, responsibilities and remedies]{.underline}.
[Many]{.underline} of the chapters in this volume reveal early
[attempt]{.underline}s [to exogenise]{.underline} the [global financial
crisis and **play down its severity**]{.underline} (for example, in
Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland), although such frames can
survive intact for long periods when there is no credible opposition to
produce authoritative counter-frames (for example, in Singapore and to a
large extent Canada). When the context is different, however,
[these]{.underline} same framing [strategies can become **barriers to
political success**]{.underline}.

## War Predictions Good

### AT Tetlock

#### Tetlock's [wrong]{.underline} -- years later, he concluded that [some]{.underline} individuals develop the ability to [forecast]{.underline} and predict events correctly if they [engage]{.underline} with the facts, which is [exactly]{.underline} what debate teaches us to do.

**Horgan 15** (John Horgan; writer for the Scientific American, in an
interview with Philip Tetlock following the publication of his new book
"Superforcasting: The Art and Science of Prediction"; 10/2/15;
Scientific American; "Can We Improve Predictions? Q&A with Philip
'Superforecasting' Tetlock";
<https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/can-we-improve-predictions-q-a-with-philip-superforecasting-tetlock/>;
Accessed: 7/20/19; AU-camp)

I've been hard on social science, even suggesting that "social science"
is an oxymoron. I noted, however, that social science has enormous
potential, especially when it combines "rigorous empiricism with a
resistance to absolute answers." The work of Philip Tetlock possesses
these qualities, and it addresses a fundamental question: How
predictable are social events? [His early research, which assessed
experts' ability to foresee things like]{.underline} elections, economic
collapses and [wars, highlighted the difficulties of
prediction]{.underline}. See, for example, how I cite him in a column on
whether the public should defer to the judgment of scientific experts.
[**Tetlock's new book**]{.underline} Superforecasting: The Art and
Science of Prediction, co-written with journalist Dan Gardner, [**is
much more upbeat**.]{.underline} The book has already received raves
from The Economist, Wall Street Journal, former Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, psychologist Steven Pinker, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman
and others. I blurbed the book a few months ago. [Tetlock,]{.underline}
I wrote, "[shows that **certain people** can forecast events with
accuracy much better than chance]{.underline}---[and so]{.underline},
perhaps, [can]{.underline} the rest of [us, **if we emulate** the
critical thinking of these 'superforecasters.]{.underline}' The
self-empowerment genre doesn't get any smarter and more sophisticated
than this." Tetlock, a social psychologist at the University of
Pennsylvania, recently responded to my questions about his book and
related topics. Horgan: [You're renowned for showing in your 2005
book]{.underline} Expert Political Judgment [how hard it is to predict
social phenomena]{.underline}. And yet [your new book is **much more
optimistic** about the possibility of accurate prediction]{.underline}.
Is there anything in your first book that you take back? Tetlock:
Nothing springs to mind. [The contradictions are]{.underline}, in my
view, more apparent than [real]{.underline}. There are two big
geopolitical forecasting-tournament data sets, one linked to Expert
Political Judgment, summarizing tournaments that ran from 1985 -- 2002,
and the other linked to GJP (Good Judgment Project), otherwise known as
the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency) tournament,
which ran from 2011 -- 2015. There are, of course, important
similarities. Both tournaments pose questions about possible futures
well specified enough to pass the clairvoyance test. And they ask
forecasters to make judgments along probability scales. But there are
big differences\--and these differences account for the different
findings and emphases in interpretation. (Was it Heisenberg who said:
"We know nature only as it is exposed to our methods of questioning"?
Regardless, that truism is certainly true of forecasting tournaments.)
The cumulative effect of all these differences was that [there were
**more opportunities and incentives** for forecasters to shine in the
later work than in the earlier work]{.underline}. [Consider this list of
differences: (1) the shortest questions]{.underline} in the earlier work
(asking people to look out about one year) [were shorter than all but
the very longest questions in the later work]{.underline} (the vast
majority of questions that superforecasters required looking out several
months but less than a year); [(2) forecasters in the earlier work
wanted anonymity whereas forecasters in the later work wanted to be
recognized]{.underline} on leaderboards; [(3) forecasters in the earlier
work rarely had opportunities to update their beliefs]{.underline}
whereas forecasters in the later work were strongly encouraged to update
their probability estimates as often as they felt the news warranted.
Put differently, [the]{.underline} much more [**publicly**
**competitive** **nature** of]{.underline} the IARPA [**tournaments**
pressures people to be **more open minded**, to be foxier, than they
normally are]{.underline} (more so than do EPJ tournaments)\--[because
they **raise** the]{.underline} reputational [risks of
closed-mindedness]{.underline}. I suppose that is why people who have
read both Expert Political Judgment and Superforecasting see the latter
book as more upbeat, more about lighting candles than cursing the
darkness. That is probably a pretty fair assessment. Deep down, I see
the two books as complementary, not contradictory. Horgan: You have
discovered that [certain people possess traits that make them
"superforecasters]{.underline}," who are much better than average at
predicting social events. Can these traits be automated, that is, be
codified in algorithms? Tetlock: We describe in the book an opportunity
to discuss this problem with David Ferrucci, the creator of WATSON (the
artificial-intelligence world-champion in Jeopardy). He agreed, for
instance, that WATSON would have little difficulty answering a question
like: which two Russian leaders traded jobs in the last five years? But
he noted it would be quite another matter to answer the question: will
those same Russian leaders change jobs in the next five years? The
second question is one that superforecasters would find pretty easy (I
think) but that no artificial-intelligence system on the planet today
could field in a compelling way. Why is the second question so much more
difficult than the first? Because [answering the]{.underline} second
[question requires a somewhat intricate causal model]{.underline} of the
Russian political system[, of the personalities involved, and of the
evolving threats and opportunities they are likely to
confront.]{.underline} It is not \"just\" a matter of scanning a massive
database and triangulating in on the most plausible Bayesian-estimated
answer. I put scare quotes around \"just\" because I do not in any way
want to trivialize what an extraordinary achievement WATSON is. Horgan:
Are you a believer in the power of Big Data to revolutionize the social
sciences? Will social science ever be as precise and rigorous as
physics? Tetlock: I\'m not sure about \"revolutionizing\" social
science, but Big Data will clearly make it possible to answer many
categories of questions that were previously unanswerable. We now have
massive databases on interpersonal relations (e.g. Facebook), search
behavior (Google), consumer behavior (seemingly everywhere).
Tangentially: Companies routinely do things to all of us that the human
subjects review boards at universities would categorize as
unconscionably unethical. Either university review boards are
ridiculously hypersensitive or Big Data firms are ridiculously
insensitive. I think it is a mix. Horgan: Social theories and
predictions can have an enormous impact on societies, as Marx's impact
on history demonstrates. Does this feedback factor contribute to the
difficulty of social prediction? Is it possible to build models that
take this factor into account? Tetlock: I agree that self-fulfilling and
self-negating prophecies do indeed \"contribute to the difficulty of
social prediction.\" These effects are difficult to measure and model
but not always impossible. For instance, many of the questions asked in
the most recent forecasting tournaments were conditional forecasts of
the form: if the U.S. government (or another entity) does X or Y, how
likely is this outcome Z? Of course, it will only be possible to
evaluate the empirical accuracy of forecasts along one branch of the
conditional (the option that the decision-making entity embraces). The
other branch becomes part of counterfactual history (we never get a
chance to observe what would have happened if we had gone down that
other path). One could argue that forecasting
**[tournaments]{.underline}** do, however, [**shed some indirect light**
even on the accuracy of judgments about counterfactual
history.]{.underline} After all, whose judgments about what would\'ve
happened do you trust more: those who were accurate in the actual world
or those were inaccurate? Some readers might wonder why we should care
about trying to construct indirect gauges of who is more likely to be
correct in their judgments of counterfactual worlds. It turns out,
though, that the [assumptions we make about what would\'ve
happened]{.underline} in these counterfactual worlds [underlie all
causal lessons we draw from history.]{.underline} If you believe the
Iraq 2003 war was a mistake, that means you believe that things would
have worked out better in the counterfactual worlds in which the U.S.
did not launch that invasion\--and Saddam Hussein might still be in
power. Don\'t forget: even if your counterfactual belief is widely
shared, it is still a counterfactual belief, not a factual one. Horgan:
Surveys I've been carrying out for a dozen years show that about nine in
ten Americans believe war will never be eradicated. I fear that this
pessimistic belief will be self-fulfilling. Can you comment on this
specific possibility and on the more general problem of self-fulfilling
prophecies? Tetlock: Too big a question for my taste, but I will hazard
a few observations. The classic definition of a \"state\" is an
organization that claims a monopoly on the use of force in a given
territory. As long as the world is divided into competitive
nation-states, each of which claims to be a law unto itself, and as long
as the international system is \"anarchic\" (no world government with
effective enforcement powers), there will be potential for war. But the
optimist in me is heartened by how circumspect nuclear-armed states have
been about even threatening to use nuclear weapons (even North Korea\'s
bark seems to be much worse than its bite, so far). And it is
interesting how rarely well-established democracies fight each other. So
I suppose this is a rather long-winded way of saying: I don\'t know and
I don\'t think anyone on the planet does. Horgan: The research you
describe in Superforecasting was funded by the Department of Defense.
Did you have any qualms about accepting military money? Are you
concerned, more generally, about the dependence of American researchers
on military funding? Tetlock: IARPA placed no constraints on our ability
to publish\-- and no classified information was involved. In these
senses, we had as much freedom as we would have if we had been supported
by the National Science Foundation. (IARPA is, incidentally, part of
U.S. intelligence community\--not part of the military. The larger
question obviously still stands). I have a hard time imagining the
National Science Foundation deciding to support something as deeply
interdisciplinary as forecasting tournaments (which cross the boundaries
of several sections of NSF: judgment and decision-making, social and
individual-difference psychology, statistics, economics, political
science). My view is that forecasting [**tournaments deepen our
understanding** of how to generate realistic probability estimates\--
and, thus reduce the likelihood of calamitous intelligence
errors]{.underline} of the sort that led to the 2003 Iraq war (where the
intelligence community was egregiously overconfident in its assessment
of the likelihood of finding active programs to produce weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq\-- most vividly captured in the famous slamdunk
quote). [Insofar as our research **reduces** the likelihood of such
errors in the future, it handily passes my cost-benefit
test.]{.underline}

#### **Authorities might be [wrong]{.underline} about predicted futures, but [debating]{.underline} over their works from the [outside-in]{.underline} is [key]{.underline} to resolve their errors.**

**Epstein 19** (David Epstein; reporter for The Atlantic; June 2019; The
Atlantic; "The Peculiar Blindness of Experts";
<https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/how-to-predict-the-future/588040/>;
Accessed: 7/20/19; AU-camp)

[Credentialed authorities are **comically bad** at predicting the
future. **But reliable forecasting is possible**]{.underline}**.** The
bet was on, and it was over the fate of humanity. On one side was the
Stanford biologist Paul R. Ehrlich. In his 1968 best seller, The
Population Bomb, Ehrlich insisted that it was too late to prevent a
doomsday apocalypse resulting from overpopulation. Resource shortages
would cause hundreds of millions of starvation deaths within a decade.
It was cold, hard math: The human population was growing exponentially;
the food supply was not. Ehrlich was an accomplished butterfly
specialist. He knew that nature did not regulate animal populations
delicately. Populations exploded, blowing past the available resources,
and then crashed. In his book, Ehrlich played out hypothetical scenarios
that represented "the kinds of disasters that will occur." In the
worst-case scenario, famine rages across the planet. Russia, China, and
the United States are dragged into nuclear war, and the resulting
environmental degradation soon extinguishes the human race. In the
"cheerful" scenario, population controls begin. Famine spreads, and
countries teeter, but the major death wave ends in the mid-1980s. Only
half a billion or so people die of starvation. "I challenge you to
create one more optimistic," Ehrlich wrote, adding that he would not
count scenarios involving benevolent aliens bearing care packages. The
economist Julian Simon took up Ehrlich's challenge.
Technology---water-control techniques, hybridized seeds, management
strategies---had revolutionized agriculture, and global crop yields were
increasing. To Simon, more people meant more good ideas about how to
achieve a sustainable future. So he proposed a wager. Ehrlich could
choose five metals that he expected to become more expensive as
resources were depleted and chaos ensued over the next decade. Both men
agreed that commodity prices were a fine proxy for the effects of
population growth, and they set the stakes at \$1,000 worth of Ehrlich's
five metals. If, 10 years hence, prices had gone down, Ehrlich would
have to pay the difference in value to Simon. If prices went up, Simon
would be on the hook for the difference. The bet was made official in
1980. In October 1990, Simon found a check for \$576.07 in his mailbox.
Ehrlich got smoked. The price of every one of the metals had declined.
In the 1960s, 50 out of every 100,000 global citizens died annually from
famine; by the 1990s, that number was 2.6. Ehrlich's starvation
predictions were almost comically bad. And yet, the very same year he
conceded the bet, Ehrlich doubled down in another book, with another
prediction that would prove untrue: Sure, his timeline had been a little
off, he wrote, but "now the population bomb has detonated." Despite one
erroneous prediction after another, Ehrlich amassed an enormous
following and received prestigious awards. Simon, meanwhile, became a
standard-bearer for scholars who felt that Ehrlich had ignored economic
principles. The kind of excessive regulations Ehrlich advocated, the
Simon camp argued, would quell the very innovation that had delivered
humanity from catastrophe. Both men became luminaries in their
respective domains. Both were mistaken. When economists later examined
metal prices for every 10-year window from 1900 to 2008, during which
time the world population quadrupled, they saw that Ehrlich would have
won the bet 62 percent of the time. The catch: Commodity prices are a
poor gauge of population effects, particularly over a single decade. The
variable that both men were certain would vindicate their worldviews
actually had little to do with those views. Prices waxed and waned with
macroeconomic cycles. Yet both men dug in. Each declared his faith in
science and the undisputed primacy of facts. And each continued to miss
the value of the other's ideas. Ehrlich was wrong about the apocalypse,
but right on aspects of environmental degradation. Simon was right about
the influence of human ingenuity on food and energy supplies, but wrong
in claiming that improvements in air and water quality validated his
theories. Ironically, those improvements were bolstered through
regulations pressed by Ehrlich and others. Ideally[, **intellectual
sparring partners "hone each other's arguments so that they are sharper
and better**,]{.underline}" the Yale historian Paul Sabin wrote in The
Bet. "The opposite happened with Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon." As each
man amassed more information for his own view, each became more
dogmatic, and the inadequacies in his model of the world grew ever more
stark. The pattern is by now familiar. In the 30 years since Ehrlich
sent Simon a check, the track record of expert forecasters---in science,
in economics, in politics---is as dismal as ever. In business, esteemed
(and lavishly compensated) [forecasters routinely are wildly wrong in
their predictions of everything from the next stock-market correction to
the next housing boom.]{.underline} [Reliable insight into the future
**is possible,** however. **It just requires a style of thinking that's
uncommon** among experts who are certain that their deep knowledge has
granted them a special grasp of what is to come]{.underline}. he idea
for the most important study ever conducted of expert predictions was
sparked in 1984, at a meeting of a National Research Council committee
on American-Soviet relations. The psychologist and political scientist
Philip E. Tetlock was 30 years old, by far the most junior committee
member. He listened intently as other members discussed Soviet
intentions and American policies. Renowned experts delivered
authoritative predictions, and Tetlock was struck by how many perfectly
contradicted one another and were impervious to counterarguments.
[Tetlock decided to put expert political and economic predictions to the
test.]{.underline} With the Cold War in full swing, he collected
forecasts from 284 highly educated experts who averaged more than 12
years of experience in their specialties. To ensure that the predictions
were concrete, experts had to give specific probabilities of future
events. Tetlock had to collect enough predictions that he could separate
lucky and unlucky streaks from true skill. The project lasted 20 years,
and comprised 82,361 probability estimates about the future. The result:
[The experts were, by and large, horrific forecasters.]{.underline}
Their areas of specialty, years of experience, and (for some) access to
classified information made no difference. They were bad at short-term
forecasting and bad at long-term forecasting. They were bad at
forecasting in every domain. When experts declared that future events
were impossible or nearly impossible, 15 percent of them occurred
nonetheless. When they declared events to be a sure thing, more than
one-quarter of them failed to transpire. As the Danish proverb warns,
"It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future."
[Even faced with their results, many experts never admitted systematic
flaws in their judgment.]{.underline} When they missed wildly, it was a
near miss; if just one little thing had gone differently, they would
have nailed it. "[There is often a curiously inverse
relationship,]{.underline}" Tetlock concluded, "[between how well
forecasters thought they were doing and how well they did.]{.underline}"
Early predictions in Tetlock's research pertained to the future of the
Soviet Union. Some experts (usually liberals) saw Mikhail Gorbachev as
an earnest reformer who would be able to change the Soviet Union and
keep it intact for a while, and other experts (usually conservatives)
felt that the Soviet Union was immune to reform and losing legitimacy.
Both sides were partly right and partly wrong. Gorbachev did bring real
reform, opening the Soviet Union to the world and empowering citizens.
But those reforms unleashed pent-up forces in the republics outside
Russia, where the system had lost legitimacy. The forces blew the Soviet
Union apart. Both camps of experts were blindsided by the swift demise
of the U.S.S.R[. **One subgroup of scholars,** however, **did manage to
see more of what was coming**]{.underline}**.** Unlike Ehrlich and
Simon, [they were not vested in a single discipline]{.underline}. [They
took from each argument and integrated apparently contradictory
worldviews]{.underline}. They agreed that Gorbachev was a real reformer
and that the Soviet Union had lost legitimacy outside Russia. A few of
those integrators saw that the end of the Soviet Union was close at hand
and that real reforms would be the catalyst[. The integrators
outperformed their colleagues in pretty much every way, but especially
trounced them on long-term predictions.]{.underline} Eventually,
[Tetlock]{.underline} [bestowed nicknames]{.underline} (borrowed from
the philosopher Isaiah Berlin) [on the experts]{.underline} he'd
observed: The highly specialized hedgehogs knew "one big thing," while
the integrator **[foxes]{.underline}** knew "many little things."
[Hedgehogs are deeply and tightly focused. Some have spent their career
studying one problem]{.underline}. Like Ehrlich and Simon, they fashion
tidy theories of how the world works based on observations through the
single lens of their specialty. **[Foxes]{.underline}**, meanwhile,
**"[draw from an eclectic array of traditions,]{.underline}** [and
accept ambiguity and contradiction,"]{.underline} Tetlock wrote. Where
hedgehogs represent narrowness[, foxes embody **breadth**]{.underline}.
Incredibly, the [hedgehogs performed especially poorly on long-term
predictions]{.underline} within their specialty. They got worse as they
accumulated experience and credentials in their field. [The more
information they had to work with, the more easily they could fit any
story into their worldview.]{.underline} Unfortunately, the world's most
prominent specialists are rarely held accountable for their predictions,
so we continue to rely on them even when their track records make clear
that we should not. One study compiled a decade of annual dollar-to-euro
exchange-rate predictions made by 22 international banks: Barclays,
Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and others. Each year, every bank predicted
the end-of-year exchange rate. The banks missed every single change of
direction in the exchange rate. In six of the 10 years, the true
exchange rate fell outside the entire range of all 22 bank forecasts. In
2005, tetlock published his results, and they caught the attention of
the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, or IARPA, a
government organization that supports research on the U.S. intelligence
community's most difficult challenges. In 2011, IARPA launched a
four-year prediction tournament in which five researcher-led teams
competed. Each team could recruit, train, and experiment however it saw
fit. Predictions were due at 9 a.m. every day. The questions were hard:
Will a European Union member withdraw by a target date? Will the Nikkei
close above 9,500? Tetlock, along with his wife and collaborator, the
psychologist Barbara Mellers, ran a team named the Good Judgment
Project. Rather than recruit decorated experts, they issued an open call
for volunteers. [After]{.underline} a simple screening, [they invited
3,200 people to start forecasting.]{.underline} Among those, they
identified [a small group of the foxiest forecasters---bright people
with **extremely wide-ranging interests** and unusually **expansive
reading habits**, **but no particular relevant
background**]{.underline}---and weighted team forecasts toward their
predictions. They [**destroyed the competition**.]{.underline} Tetlock
and Mellers found that not only were the best forecasters foxy as
individuals, but they tended to have qualities that made them
particularly effective collaborators. [**They were "curious about,**
well, really **everything**,"]{.underline} as one of the top forecasters
told me. [They crossed disciplines, and viewed their teammates as
sources for learning,]{.underline} rather than peers to be convinced.
When those foxes were later grouped into much smaller teams---12 members
each---they became even more accurate. They outperformed---by a lot---a
group of experienced intelligence analysts with access to classified
data. One forecast discussion involved a team trying to predict the
highest single-day close for the exchange rate between the Ukrainian
hryvnia and the U.S. dollar during an extremely volatile stretch in
2014. Would the rate be less than 10 hryvnia to a dollar, between 10 and
13, or more than 13? The discussion started with a team member offering
percentages for each possibility, and sharing an Economist article.
Another team member chimed in with historical data he'd found online, a
Bloomberg link, and a bet that the rate would land between 10 and 13. A
third teammate was convinced by the second's argument. A fourth shared
information about the dire state of Ukrainian finances, which he feared
would devalue the hryvnia. A fifth noted that the United Nations
Security Council was considering sending peacekeepers to the region,
which he believed would buoy the currency. Two days later, a team member
with experience in finance saw that the hryvnia was strengthening amid
events he'd thought would surely weaken it. He informed his teammates
that this was exactly the opposite of what he'd expected, and that they
should take it as a sign of something wrong in his understanding.
(Tetlock told me that, when making an argument, foxes often use the word
however, while hedgehogs favor moreover.) The team members finally homed
in on "between 10 and 13" as the heavy favorite, and they were correct.
In Tetlock's 20-year study, both the broad foxes and the narrow
hedgehogs were quick to let a successful prediction reinforce their
beliefs. But [when an outcome took them by surprise, foxes were much
more likely to adjust their ideas.]{.underline} Hedgehogs barely budged.
Some made authoritative predictions that turned out to be wildly
wrong---then updated their theories in the wrong direction. They became
even more convinced of the original beliefs that had led them astray.
[**The best forecasters**,]{.underline} by contrast, [view their own
ideas as hypotheses in need of testing]{.underline}. If they make a bet
and lose, [they **embrace the logic of a loss just as they would the
reinforcement of a win**. This is called, in a word,
learning.]{.underline}

#### Debates over [erroneous]{.underline} forecasts [force]{.underline} pundits to [accountability.]{.underline}

[Can non-experts do anything to encourage **a more effective
punditocracy**]{.underline}? Should I feel bad about watching Meet the
Press? Tetlock: Yes, [**non-experts** can encourage more accountability
in the punditocracy.]{.underline} [Pundits are]{.underline} remarkably
[skillful at appearing to go out on a limb in their claims]{.underline}
about the future, [without actually going out on one]{.underline}. For
instance, they often \"predict\" continued instability and turmoil in
the Middle East (predicting the present) but they virtually never get
around to telling you exactly what would have to happen to disconfirm
their expectations. They are essentially impossible to pin down. [If
pundits felt that their **public credibility hinged** on participating
in level **playing** field **forecasting exercises**]{.underline} in
which they must pit their wits against an extremely difficult-to-predict
world, [I suspect they would be learn,]{.underline} quite [quickly, to
be **more flexible and foxlike** in their policy
pronouncements.]{.underline}

During this Bradley Lecture, Philip [Tetlock discussed the existence of
**the rare "superforecaster"** and the secrets behind their
successes.]{.underline} He began by arguing that [superforecasting is a
skill that can be cultivated.]{.underline} [Historical events can be
assigned a probability statistic with a mathematical and psychological
foundation,]{.underline} akin to predicting the path of a hurricane.
Based on statistical models and 50 years' worth of weather charting,
meteorologists can make educated, fairly accurate predictions about
whether a hurricane will hit South Carolina or New Jersey. Similarly, by
using human judgment and statistical models, [superforecasters can make
**informed** predictions about the Grexit or the overthrow of a
dictator]{.underline}. Dr. Tetlock then described the characteristics of
[the best superforecasters.]{.underline} First, they [**pick their
battles** wisely]{.underline}. [They do not forecast highly predictable
occurrences,]{.underline} such as a pendulum's swing, [nor random
ones,]{.underline} such as roulette. [Instead they focus on the middle
of the spectrum]{.underline} --- [the chances of the Iran deal affecting
US security or China becoming more aggressive in upcoming
years.]{.underline} Also, [they start at **a reasonable base rate** by
balancing what they know.]{.underline} [They **avoid** over- and
underreacting to news,]{.underline} [looking past **the white noise** of
public opinion and reading situations with relatively high
accuracy]{.underline}. For example, while many said that the exit of
Greece from the eurozone held a high probability, superforecasters
accurately wagered that the likelihood of such an event was low.

### Deterrence True

[If [democratic nations]{.mark} are [getting into major war]{.mark}
predominantly [as a result of aggression]{.mark} or democide by
nondemocratic regimes]{.underline}, 116 [then the evidence strongly
suggests]{.underline}, at least for purposes of continuing our search
for a more comprehensive hypothesis about war, [that [the]{.mark} key
missing [link]{.mark} in democratic peace theory [is]{.mark} the
importance of external [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, are
democracies getting into war predominantly in settings where they fail
adequately to deter a potential nondemocratic decision elite willing to
engage in high-risk behavior? Considerable evidence suggests that the
answer is yes. Before examining the evidence, if we are to avoid
confusion, it is important that we define what we mean by \"deterrence\"
and \"effective deterrence\" for the purposes of this hypothesis.
Deterrence for our purposes is the totality of external incentives, that
is, incentives from the international environment, which may be high or
low, adequate or inadequate. [[Effective deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}
will be regarded as that [aggregate of external incentives understood by
a potential aggressor [as adequate to prevent an aggressive
action]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this respect, factors affecting
deterrence encompass the totality of positive and negative incentives,
including potential military responses and security arrangements,
military and power asymmetries, economic relations and trade, access to
strategic materials, diplomatic actions, effects of international
organizations and international law, alliances, collective security,
contiguity, and other \"opportunity\" factors, etc., or the lack thereof
with respect to any of these elements. Note specifically that actions
affecting incentives can be either military or non-military, either
positive (offering potential benefits) or negative (offering potential
costs), either fixed (that is, contiguity \' 17) or variable (for
example, effects of diplomacy or alliances), either objective (for
example, military divisions or nuclear weapons) or subjective (for
example, elite belief systems or perceptions as to intent), or any
combination of the above. Such factors also encompass both denial of
objective and threat of punishment (imposition of costs) in classic
deterrence theory. 118 Effective deterrence requires understanding by
the potential aggressor of an aggregate of incentives sufficient to
prevent the aggression. As such, communication and subjectivities,
including interactions with the perspectives and belief system of the
potential aggressor and past statements and actions of any potential
defender, are critical for effectiveness. \"9 Ultimately, as the term is
used in this article, [effective deterrence is a state of mind of the
potential aggressor based on perceptions of an aggregation of external
incentives]{.underline}. 120 As many scholars have demonstrated,
deterrence is also a complex concept in which we need to proceed
carefully in context and across cultures and with appreciation of both
direct and indirect effects. For example, in tracing the lack of
deterrence before World War II, the actions of the British and French at
Munich not only led Hitler to believe the Western Powers had no stomach
for war and were \"worms,\" but they also led Stalin to believe that he
should strike a separate deal with Hitler since the French had been
unwilling to join the offered Soviet guarantee for the independence of
Czechoslovakia conditioned on French joint agreement. In turn, Stalin\'s
Molotov-Ribbentrop alliance not only drastically reduced the deterrence
of Hitler by removing the traditional German problem of a two front war
(indeed, it now assured Soviet complicity in dividing up Eastern
Europe), but it led Hitler to believe that the British would not take
seriously their guarantee to Poland since he believed his Pact with
Stalin was a deterrent to British action in defense of Poland. Of
critical importance in understanding deterrence, it should also be noted
that secret threats or capabilities are not enough. Communication of the
positive or negative incentives or, more broadly, adequate perception of
the costs by the decision elite considering the action is essential.
[The failure of deterrence by the United States before the Korean and
Gulf Wars was not a lack of appreciation of the United States as a
nuclear superpower but rather a conviction, based on the totality of
U.S. actions and communications, that U.S. power was irrelevant to the
planned aggression]{.underline}. Similarly, communication of will or
intent is not adequate if it is perceived that the means for carrying
out the threat are unavailable. Woodrow Wilson clearly signaled to
Germany before the United States entered World War I that if Germany did
not stop sinking neutral American shipping, the United States would
enter the war against Germany. But in this case, [Germany\'s assessment
of profound United States military weakness coupled with their dire need
to shut down shipping to Britain if they were to reverse the stalemate
on the Western Front led them to continue to sink American ships,
bringing the United States into the war.]{.underline} The German
[miscalculation]{.underline} was [that it would take the United States
at least a year to become an effective participant]{.underline}. In this
they were wrong by a few crucial months. [Similarly, the Japanese attack
at Pearl Harbor was not based on the illusion that the United States
would not then enter the war against Japan.]{.underline} [Rather, the
combination of then inadequate U.S. military strength, coupled with a
conviction that a military strike against Pearl Harbor could effectively
free Japan in the Pacific]{.underline} [for a matter of months led
Japanese leaders to believe that the United States would sue for
peace]{.underline} in the face of their overwhelming military
superiority. Effective deterrence, conversely, does not mean simply
intransigence or bullying. It seeks a realistic mix of incentives
sufficient to produce the desired action or inaction and recognizes that
in some settings, an absence of flexibility may produce a contrary
result. It must be contextual, accounting for the myriad relevant
features affecting incentives and beliefs.12 1 We should never
underestimate the complexity of achieving effective deterrence. 22
Moreover, we should always bear in mind that some actions taken for
deterrence may produce an opposite effect unless levels of deterrence
necessary for true effectiveness are achieved. For example, economic
sanctions critical to a challenger\'s objectives or a clear commitment
to defense in a setting otherwise lacking the elements of full effective
deterrence would be inadequate. Some have argued that this was a problem
with U.S. policy toward Japan prior to the Pearl Harbor attack. 123
Finally, deterrence should never be perceived as a substitute for a
comprehensive and well-designed foreign policy.\' 2 As so broadly
conceived, [there is [strong evidence that **deterrence**]{.mark}-that
[is]{.mark}, the effect of external factors on the decision to go to
war-**is [the missing link in the war/peace
equation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In my War & Peace Seminar, I have
undertaken to examine the [level of deterrence before the principal wars
of the twentieth century]{.underline}. 125 My examination [has
led]{.underline} [me to believe that]{.underline} in every case **[[the
potential aggressor made a]{.mark} rational [calculation that the war
would be won]{.mark}, and won promptly]{.underline}.** In fact, the
longest period of time calculated for victory through conventional
attack seems to be the roughly six weeks predicted by the German General
Staff as the time necessary to prevail on the Western Front in World War
I under the Schlieffen Plan. [[Hitler believed]{.mark} in [his attack on
Poland]{.mark} that Britain and France would not take the occasion to go
to war with him.]{.underline} And he believed in his 1941 Operation
Barbarossa against the Soviet Union that \"\[we\] have only to kick in
the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.\"\' 126
In contrast, following Hermann Goering\'s failure to obtain air
superiority in the Battle of Britain, Hitler called off the invasion of
Britain and shifted strategy to the nighttime bombing of population
centers, which became known as the Blitz, in a mistaken effort to compel
Britain to sue for peace. [Planners of the North Korean attack on South
Korea and [Hussein]{.mark}\'s attack on Kuwait [calculated]{.mark} that
the [operations would be complete in a matter of
days.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, virtually all principal wars in the
twentieth century, at least those involving conventional invasion, [were
preceded by]{.underline} what I refer to as [a \"double deterrence
absence.\"]{.underline} That is, [the potential aggressor believed that
they had the military force in place to prevail promptly and that
nations that might have the military or diplomatic might to prevent this
were not inclined to intervene]{.underline}.127 This analysis has also
shown that [many of the perceptions we have about the origins of
particular wars are flatly wrong]{.underline}. Anyone who seriously
believes that World War I was begun by competing alliances drawing
tighter should examine the real historical record of British
unwillingness to enter a clear military alliance with the French or to
so inform the Kaiser. Indeed, this pre-World War I absence of effective
alliance and resultant war contrasts sharply with the later robust NATO
alliance and an absence of World War Ill.128 Considerable other evidence
seems to support this historical analysis as to the importance of
deterrence. Of particular note, in 1995 Yale Professor Donald Kagan, a
preeminent U.S. historian who has long taught a seminar on war,
published a superb book On the Origins of War and the Preservation of
Peace.\'29 In this book he conducts a detailed examination of [[the
Peloponnesian War, World War I, Hannibal\'s War, and World War
II]{.mark},]{.underline} among other case studies. A careful reading of
these studies suggests that [[each]{.mark} war [could have been
prevented by achievable deterrence]{.mark} and that each occurred in the
absence of such deterrence.]{.underline}1 30 [**[Game theory]{.mark}**
seems to [offer]{.mark} yet [further]{.mark} [support]{.mark} for the
proposition that appropriate deterrence can prevent war.]{.underline}
For example, Robert Axelrod\'s famous 1980s experiment in an iterated
[prisoner\'s dilemma]{.underline}, which is [a reasonably close proxy
for many conflict settings in international relations, repeatedly showed
the effectiveness of a simple tit for tat strategy]{.underline}. 13 1
Such a strategy is at core simply a basic method of deterrence,
influencing behavior through incentives. Similarly, much of the
game-theoretic work on crisis bargaining (and the danger of asymmetric
information) in relation to war and the democratic peace assumes the
importance of deterrence through communication of incentives. 132 The
well-known correlation between war and territorial contiguity seems also
to underscore the importance of deterrence and is likely principally a
proxy for levels of perceived profit and military achievability of
aggression in many such settings. It should further be noted that the
democratic peace is not the only significant correlation with respect to
war and peace, although it seems to be the most robust. Professors
Russett and Oneal, in recently exploring the other elements of the
Kantian proposal for \"Perpetual Peace,\" have also shown a strong and
statistically significant correlation between economically important
bilateral trade between two nations and a reduction in the risk of war
between them. Contrary to the arguments of \"dependency theorists,\"
such economically important trade seems to reduce the risk of war
regardless of the size relationship or asymmetry in the trade balance
between the two states. In addition, there is a statistically
significant association between economic openness generally and
reduction in the risk of war, although this association is not as strong
as the effect of an economically important bilateral trade relationship.
133 Russett and Oneal also show a modest independent correlation between
reduction in the risk of war and higher levels of common membership in
international organizations.134 And they show that a large imbalance of
power between two states significantly lessens the risk of major war
between them. 135 All of these empirical findings about war also seem to
directly reflect incentives. That is, a higher level of trade would, if
foregone in war, impose higher costs in the aggregate than without such
trade, 136 though we know that not all wars terminate trade. A large
imbalance of power in a relationship rather obviously impacts deterrence
and incentives. Similarly, one might incur higher costs with high levels
of common membership in international organizations through foregoing
some of the heightened benefits of such participation or otherwise being
presented with different options through the actions or effects of such
organizations. These external deterrence elements may be yet another
reason why democracies have a lower risk of war with one another. For
their freer markets, trade, commerce, and international engagement may
place them in a position where their generally higher level of
interaction means that aggression will incur substantial opportunity
costs. Thus, the \"mechanism\" of the democratic peace may be an
aggregate of factors affecting incentives, both external as well as
internal factors. Because of the underlying truth in the relationship
between higher levels of trade and lower levels of war, it is not
surprising that theorists throughout human history, including Baron de
Montesquieu in 1748, Thomas Paine in 1792, John Stuart Mill in 1848,
and, most recently, the founders of the European Community, have argued
that increasing commerce and interactions among nations would end war.
Though by themselves these arguments have been overoptimistic, it may
well be that some level of \"globalization\" may make the costs of war
and the gains of peace so high as to powerfully predispose to peace.
Indeed, a 1989 book by John Mueller, Retreat From Doomsday,137
postulates the obsolescence of major war between developed nations (at
least those nations within the \"first and second worlds\") as they
become increasingly conscious of the rising costs of war and the rising
gains of peace. In assessing levels of democracy, there are indexes
readily available, for example, the Polity 111138 and Freedom House
indexes. 139 I am unaware of any comparable index with respect to levels
of deterrence that might be used to test the importance of deterrence in
war avoidance. 140 Absent such an accepted index, discussion about the
importance of deterrence is subject to the skeptical observation that
one simply defines effective deterrence by whether a war did or did not
occur. In order to begin to deal with the obvious objections to this
method and to encourage a more objective methodology for assessing
deterrence, I encouraged a project to develop a rough but objective
measure of deterrence with a scale from -10 to + 10 based on a large
variety of contextual features that would be given some relative
weighting in a complex deterrence equation before applying the scaling
to different war and non-war settings.14\' An innovative first effort
uniformly showed high deterrence scores in settings where war did not,
in fact, occur. Deterring a Soviet first strike in the Cuban Missile
Crisis produced a score of +8.5 and preventing a Soviet attack against
NATO produced a score of +6. War settings, however, produced scores
ranging from -2.29 (Saddam Hussein\'s decision to invade Kuwait in the
Gulf War), -2.18 (North Korea\'s decision to invade South Korea in the
Korean War), -1.85 (Hitler\'s decision to invade Poland in World War
II), -1.54 (North Vietnam\'s decision to invade South Vietnam following
the Paris Accords), -0.65 (Slobodan Milosevic\'s decision to defy NATO
in Kosovo), +0.5 (the Japanese decision to attack Pearl Harbor), +1.25
(the Austrian decision, encouraged by Germany, to attack Serbia, which
was the real beginning of World War I), to +1.75 (the German decision to
invade Belgium and France in World War I). As a further effort at
scaling and as a point of comparison, I undertook to simply provide an
impressionistic rating based on my study of each pre-crisis setting.
That produced high positive scores of +9 for both deterring a Soviet
first strike during the Cuban Missile Crisis and NATO\'s deterrence of a
Warsaw Pact attack and even lower scores than the more objective effort
in settings where wars had occurred. Thus, I scored North Vietnam\'s
decision to invade South Vietnam following the Paris Accords and the
German decision to invade Poland at the beginning of World War II as -6.
I scored the North Korean/Stalin decision to invade South Korea in the
Korean War as -5, the Iraqi decision to invade Kuwait as -4,
Milosevic\'s decision to defy NATO in Kosovo and the German decision to
invade Belgium and France in World War I as -2, and the Austrian
decision to attack Serbia and the Japanese decision to attack Pearl
Harbor as -1. Certainly even knowledgeable experts would be likely to
differ in their impressionistic scores on such pre-crisis settings, and
a more objective methodology for scoring deterrence would be valuable.
Nevertheless, both exercises did seem to suggest that deterrence matters
and that high levels of deterrence can prevent war. Yet another piece of
the puzzle, which may clarify the extent of deterrence necessary in
certain settings, may also assist in building a broader hypothesis about
war. In fact, it has been incorporated into the efforts at scoring
deterrence just discussed. That is[, **newer [studies of human
behavior]{.mark}** are increasingly [show]{.mark}ing [that]{.mark}
certain [perceptions of decision makers can influence the level of risk
they]{.mark} may be [willing to undertake]{.mark}]{.underline}. It now
seems likely that a number of such insights about human behavior in
decision making may be useful in considering and fashioning deterrence
strategies. Perhaps of greatest relevance is the insight of [\"prospect
theory,\" which posits that individuals evaluate outcomes with respect
to deviations from a reference point and that they may be more
risk-averse in settings posing potential gain than in settings posing
potential loss]{.underline}. 142 **[The evidence of this \"[cognitive
bias]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** whether **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}**

policy decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}** generally, [**[is
significant]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Because of the newness of efforts to
apply a laboratory-based \"prospect theory\" to the complex foreign
policy process generally, and particularly due to ambiguities and
uncertainties in framing such complex events, our consideration of it in
the war/peace process should certainly be cautious. It does, however,
seem to elucidate some of the case studies. In the war/peace setting,
\"prospect theory\" suggests that **[deterrence may not need to be as
strong to prevent aggressive action leading to perceived
gain]{.underline}**. For example, [there is credible evidence that even
an informal warning to Kaiser Wilhelm II]{.underline} from British
Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, if it had come early in the crisis
before events had moved too far, [might have averted World War
I.]{.underline} [And even a modicum of deterrence in
Kuwait]{.underline}, as was provided by a small British contingent when
Kuwait was earlier threatened by an irredentist Iraqi government in
1961, [might have been sufficient to deter Saddam Hussei]{.underline}n
from his 1990 attack. Similarly, [even a clear U.S. pledge to defend
South Korea before the attack might have prevented the Korean
War.]{.underline} Conversely, following the July 28 Austrian
mobilization and declaration of war against Serbia in World War I, the
issue for Austria may have begun to be perceived as loss avoidance, thus
requiring much higher levels of deterrence to avoid the resulting war.
Similarly, the Rambouillet Agreement may have been perceived by
Milosevic as risking loss of Kosovo and his continued rule of Serbia,
and, as a result, may have required higher levels of NATO deterrence to
prevent Milosevic\'s actions in defiance. Certainly NATO\'s previous
hesitant response against Milosevic in the Bosnia phase of the Yugoslav
crisis did not create a high level of deterrence. 143 One can only
surmise whether the killing in Kosovo could have been avoided had NATO
taken a different tack, both structuring the issue less as loss
avoidance for Milosevic and considerably enhancing deterrence.
[Suppose]{.underline}, for example, [NATO had emphasized that it had no
interest in intervening in Serbia\'s civil conflict with the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) but that it would emphatically take action to
punish massive \"ethnic cleansing\" and other humanitarian outrages, as
had been practiced in Bosnia]{.underline}. And on the deterrence side,
suppose it made clear in advance that any NATO bombardment would be
severe, that ground troops would be introduced if necessary, that in any
assault it would pursue a \"Leadership Strategy\" focused on targets of
importance to Milosevic and his principal henchmen (including their hold
on power), and that unlike earlier in Bosnia, NATO immediately would
seek to generate war crime indictments of all top Serbian leaders
implicated in any atrocities. The point here is not to second-guess
NATO\'s actions in Kosovo but to suggest that taking into account
potential \"cognitive bias,\" such as \"prospect theory,\" may be useful
in fashioning effective deterrence. \"Prospect theory\" may also be
relevant in predicting that **[[it is easier to
deter]{.underline}]{.mark}** (that is, lower levels are necessary) [**an
aggression [than]{.mark} to [undo]{.mark} that
[aggression]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Thus, much higher levels of
deterrence were probably required to compel Saddam Hussein to leave
Kuwait than to prevent him from initially invading that State. In fact,
not even the presence of a powerful Desert Storm military force and a
Security Council Resolution directing him to leave caused Hussein to
voluntarily withdraw. As this real world example illustrates, there is
considerable experimental evidence in \"prospect theory\" of an almost
instant renormalization of reference point after a gain. That is,
relatively quickly after Saddam Hussein took Kuwait, a withdrawal was
framed as a loss setting, which he would take high risks to avoid.
Indeed, we tend to think of such settings as settings of compellance,
requiring higher levels of incentive to achieve compulsion producing an
action, as opposed to lower levels of deterrence needed for prevention.
One should also be careful not to overstate the effect of \"prospect
theory\" or fail to assess a threat in its complete context. We should
remember that a belated pledge by Great Britain to defend Poland before
the Nazi attack did not deter Hitler, who believed under the
circumstances that the British pledge would not be honored. It is also
possible that the greater relative wealth of democracies, which have
less to gain in all out war, is yet another internal factor contributing
to the \"democratic peace.\"\' 144 In turn, this also supports the
extraordinary tenacity and general record of success of democracies
fighting in defensive settings, as they may also have more to lose. In
assessing the adequacy of deterrence to prevent war, we might also want
to consider whether extreme ideology, strongly at odds with reality, is
a factor requiring higher levels of deterrence for effectiveness. One
example may be the extreme ideology of Pol Pot, which led to his false
belief that his Khmer Rouge forces could defeat the Vietnamese. 45 He
apparently acted on that belief in a series of border incursions against
Vietnam that ultimately ended in his losing a war. Similarly, Osama bin
Laden\'s 9/11 attack against America, hopelessly at odds with the
reality of his defeating the Western World and producing for him a
strategic disaster, seems to have been prompted by his extreme ideology
rooted in a distorted concept of Islam at war with the enlightenment.
The continuing suicide bombings against Israel, encouraged by radical
rejectionists and leading to fewer and fewer gains for the Palestinians,
may be another example. If extreme ideology is a factor to be considered
in assessing levels of deterrence, it does not mean that deterrence is
doomed to fail in such settings but only that it must be at higher
levels (and properly targeted toward the relevant decision elites behind
the specific attacks) to be effective, as is also true in perceived loss
or compellance settings. 146 Even if major war in the modem world is
predominantly a result of aggression by nondemocratic regimes, it does
not mean that all nondemocracies pose a risk of war all, or even some,
of the time. Salazar\'s Portugal did not commit aggression. Nor, today,
do Singapore or Bahrain or countless other nondemocracies pose a threat.
That is, today nondemocracy comes close to a necessary condition in
generating the high-risk behavior leading to major interstate war. But
it is, by itself, not a sufficient condition for war. The many reasons
for this, of course, include a plethora of internal factors, such as
differences in leadership perspectives and values, size of military, and
relative degree of the rule of law, as well as levels of external
deterrence.147 But [where an aggressive nondemocratic regime is present
and poses a credible military threat, then it is the totality of
external factors, that is, deterrence, that become crucial.]{.underline}

### Apocalyptic Fears Good

#### Redirection of apocalyptic fears towards [productive ends]{.underline} avoids denial and pre-configures effective action.

Redirection and the Politics of Fear [**The strategy of redirection** --
[using apocalypticism to fight]{.mark} its own most dangerous
[enthusiasms]{.mark}]{.underline} -- avoids these difficulties, but
manages to generate new ones. This [strategy is consistent with
political realism's sensitivity to context]{.underline}. This
sensitivity is [grounded in realism's resistance to moralism and
utopianism.]{.underline} Instead of formulating and applying abstract
normative principles to particular cases, the realist attends to the
actual complaints of particular people in specific circumstances.18 [As
a matter of practical political intervention,]{.underline} this means
that [the realist must be attentive]{.underline} [to the ways in which
these complaints are understood and expressed.]{.underline} For
instance, if they are expressed by appealing to apocalyptic imagery and
rhetoric, this is a fact to which the realist should be sensitive. [The
strategy of redirection, which attends to and incorporates elements of
the apocalyptic imaginary, [displays]{.mark} this kind of **[practical
and pragmatic sensitivity]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There may also be
cases in which [an appeal to apocalyptic imagery and rhetoric is a
morally appropriate response]{.underline}. [Avoiding nuclear war and
averting the worst effects of global climate change may be two such
cases]{.underline}. These are particular kinds of catastrophes that
[pose unique motivational challenges. Both are prospective catastrophes.
That is, they are the kind of [catastrophes that]{.mark}, given existing
patterns of human activity, we have reason to think could or will arise
in the future and that pose an existential threat.]{.underline} They are
catastrophes with the [**potential to [bring]{.mark}** [**about human
extinction**]{.mark} or, at the very least, to radically alter the
character of human existence in profoundly undesirable
ways.]{.underline} Prospective catastrophes present us with a unique set
of challenges. **[[Because the catastrophe is prospective, we can put it
out of our minds]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In contrast to a contemporary
or ongoing catastrophe, "the act of thinking about it is always
voluntary, and the choice of not thinking about it is always
available."19 [Because the catastrophe is gigantic in its scope, we have
**difficulty imagining its effects**.]{.underline} We are, as Gunther
Anders notes, ["incapable of mentally realizing the ¨ realities which we
ourselves have produced."]{.underline}20 [Prospective catastrophes are
difficult to visualize **because they lack imaginative analogs**. While
some of their likely effects (e.g., widespread radiation sickness,
droughts, and floods) have been experienced before, both **the vastly
increased scale and interaction of these effects mean that imagining
prospective catastrophes requires "thinking about the
unthinkable**]{.underline}."21 [**[Yet this thinking is
essential]{.mark} if we are [to meet the challenges posed by
these]{.mark} looming [catastrophes]{.mark}**[. To the extent]{.mark}
that [we cannot]{.mark} properly [conceive o]{.mark}f the
[devastation]{.mark} wrought by nuclear war or global climate change or
the part that we might play in bringing either about,
**[avoiding]{.mark} honest [confrontations]{.mark} with questions of
moral responsibility [and guilt becomes]{.mark} much
[easier]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [The imaginative challenges of
prospective catastrophes enable dangerous forms of]{.underline} denial[.
In the nuclear case, this denial took the form of optimism about the
capacity to survive and even thrive after a nuclear attack]{.underline}.
[At its most extreme, nuclear denial held out hope for some kind of
redemption through destruction.]{.underline} I have argued that
Morgenthau's turn toward a strategy of redirection can be read as a
response to these dangerous tendencies[. In the case of global climate
change, individual and collective denial have centered on challenging
scientific and expert claims about the existence, causes, and likely
effects of the phenomenon]{.underline}. The most powerful instances of
global climate change denial have come from organized and well-funded
movements whose goal is to generate epistemological and scientific
doubt.22 A different but ultimately complementary strategy has been to
accept the scientific findings on climate change but to challenge the
seriousness of the problem or the priority of its mitigation relative to
other policy goals.23 [These challenges and questions have been
amplified by a media environment where the norm of balanced reporting
has given members of the denial movement an amount of time and airspace
vastly disproportionate to the balance of evidence on the
issue]{.underline}.24 [Given the kinds of difficulties that attend
prospective catastrophes, it may be that a strategy of apocalyptic
redirection is, all things considered, the most appropriate
response.]{.underline} In Chapter 5, we saw that one way to interpret
Morgenthau's strategy of redirection is as a self-defeating prophecy --
an attempt to cast a nuclear apocalypse as a certain future, but with
the hope of escaping this horrifying end. There may well be a good case
to be made that such a strategy is also appropriate in other cases of
prospective catastrophe as well. To see how the strategy might be used,
let us revisit an example we saw in the introductory chapter. In Davis
Guggenheim's [An Inconvenient Truth]{.underline}, which [was marketed as
"the most terrifying film you will ever see,"]{.underline} Al Gore
[shows viewers a particularly devastating set of images of communities,
neighborhoods, and landscapes annihilated by "natural"
disasters.]{.underline} These images visually [perform the task
of]{.underline} Hobbes's and Morgenthau's [apocalyptic
rhetoric.]{.underline} They are metonyms at once of our common worldly
life and of its annihilation. Pausing briefly to allow the viewer to
take in the force of these images, Gore then notes that they are "like a
nature hike through the book of Revelations \[sic\]."25 There is little
doubt that, for Gore, the fear elicited by the apocalyptic imaginary is
a salutary one. With distinct echoes of Morgenthau, Gore suggests:
Today, there are dire warnings that the worst catastrophe in the history
of human civilization is bearing down on us, gathering strength as it
comes \...The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina \... as horrible as it was,
may have been the first sip of a bitter cup which will be proffered to
us over and over again until we act on the truth we have wished would go
away \...This crisis is bringing us an opportunity to experience what
few generations in history ever have the privilege of knowing: a
generational mission; the exhilaration of a compelling moral purpose; a
shared and unifying cause; the thrill of being forced by circumstances
to put aside the pettiness and conflict that so often stifle the
restless human need for transcendence; the opportunity to rise. 26 We
can discern several familiar moves here. First, Gore [casts the
prospective catastrophe]{.underline} of climate change [as **both an
imminent and a contemporary problem**. It is "bearing down on us,
gathering strength as it comes."]{.underline} This catastrophe, he notes
earlier, "could be set in motion in the lifetime of children already
living -- unless we act boldly and quickly \...We are in grave danger of
crossing a point of no return within the next 10 years!"27 Second, Gore
makes the catastrophic potential of global climate change more vivid by
invoking a terrifying contemporary analog -- the devastation of
Hurricane Katrina, "the first sip of a bitter cup which will be
proffered to us over and over again." Beyond echoing Winston Churchill's
condemnation of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policy, the language
of "proffered cups" calls to mind the bowls of God's wrath in
Revelation. Like Morgenthau, Gore gestures to the totalizing imaginative
analog of the Holocaust when he compares the gathering storm of
ecological devastation to the "evil threat posed by the Nazis."28 Third,
also like Morgenthau, Gore discerns [in the looming threat of global
climate change a transcendent and unifying purpose]{.underline}. It is
[an opportunity that must compel us to "put aside \... the pettiness and
conflict" of everyday politics and "to rise."]{.underline} [For
Morgenthau, [the]{.mark} looming [threat of nuclear annihilation]{.mark}
was, if rightly imagined, **[capable of making individuals conscious of
their shared humanity, allowing them to overcome]{.mark} the
[conflicts]{.mark}, differences, and particularities [that normally
defined the political condition]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Gore's
apocalyptic framing of climate change seems to rest on a similar set of
connections. Rightly imagined, the looming threat of climate change will
be an opportunity to put aside the petty conflicts of everyday politics
and acknowledge a "compelling moral purpose."29 Gore, like Morgenthau,
uses apocalyptic images to elicit a salutary fear. [Political uses of
fear have been criticized as fear mongering.]{.underline} [This is not
what either Morgenthau or Gore seem to be doing]{.underline}. To see
why, consider a clear case of fear mongering -- the discourse on crime
in the United States during the 1990s. Despite a dramatic drop in
violent crime starting at the beginning of the decade, the evening news
throughout the 1990s was perpetually punctuated with murders and
warnings by pundits about the rise of dangerous young "super-predators."
It is estimated that between 1990 and 1998 there was a 600 percent
increase in American network news stories on murder.30 Most Americans
are still not aware of the declining trends in violent crime.31 This
sort of [fear mongering relies on predictable patterns of human
bias.]{.underline} A recent and easily recalled news story or an
emotionally intense invocation of violent crime causes many of us to
overestimate the frequency of such events. We will then be more likely
to support tougher laws on violent crime. Fear mongering [prevents an
unbiased evaluation]{.underline} of the risk of crime [and encourages
support for bad policies. However, [cultivating apocalyptic
fears]{.mark} of nuclear war or climate change [is not]{.mark} fear
mongering in this sense]{.underline}. Morgenthau tried to elicit a
salutary fear of nuclear war in order to correct for irrational denial
of the threat. In the case of climate change, many are similarly subject
to cognitive biases and motivated reasoning that cause them either to
ignore or underestimate this global risk.32 Morgenthau and Gore are [not
[trying to elicit irrational biases; they are trying to cultivate
rational fears]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, evoking apocalyptic fear may be
an appropriate response to prospective catastrophes such as nuclear war
and global climate change. Yet the strategy is still politically risky.
As we have seen throughout this book, apocalypticism resists efforts to
contain, tame, and successfully redirect its powerful rhetoric and
imagery. Despite the efforts of early Christians such as Paul and church
fathers such as Augustine to discipline and redirect the political
radicalism of apocalypticism, the imaginary has continued to reemerge as
a challenge to sovereign power. While Savonarola tried to deploy
apocalypticism in the service of a new republican order in Renaissance
Florence, this same imaginary was eventually used to condemn the friar
himself as Antichrist. Similarly, in seventeenth-century England, the
apocalypticism that had supported sovereign and ecclesiastical power in
the sixteenth century became the basis for a radical challenge, less
than a hundred years later. Once loosed upon the world, the rich
imaginative and semiotic resources of the apocalypse have consistently
proven difficult to control. We have little reason to think that similar
dangers would not attend strategic attempts to redeploy the apocalyptic
imaginary today. Beyond acknowledging the difficulty of controlling it,
we have good reason to worry that the apocalyptic imaginary leads to
three dangerous political postures. The first and most dangerous
response is a full-throated embrace of the apocalyptic worldview, one
that divides the world into good and evil, vilifies opponents, and
pushes the battle for ultimate justice to its violent consummation. This
cosmic vision animated the European wars of religion and the English
Civil War. Today, its main champion is ISIS.33 The remaining postures
are less explosive but perhaps more likely. The second response is to
withdraw from participation in politics, as John of Patmos encouraged
early Christians to do. Those who care about the fate of their souls
must not be complicit with evil, he cautions.34 Christians who accepted
this counsel were left with no option but to give up on their political
world and await the New Jerusalem. The problem with this focus on the
imminent afterlife is that any number of more mundane injustices may go
unchecked in the meantime. The third posture is resignation. The world
is going to hell, concludes the apocalyptic believer, but there is
nothing to be done. This is a common reaction to apocalyptic images in
the climate change debate. While these images make the prospective
catastrophe more salient, they tend to decrease people's sense of
efficacy. Instead of rousing people to action, these calamitous warnings
leave them defeated and disengaged.35 Faced with terrifying and often
overtly apocalyptic representations of the effects of climate change,
many are inclined to conclude -- not entirely without good reason --
that any actions they can take will be futile. [Do]{.underline} these
[risks mean that the strategy of apocalyptic redirection should be
abandoned entirely? We need not be so hasty. **In cases of prospective
catastrophe, our judgment about the strategy of redirection must hinge
on how effectively it helps us avert the unwanted end while guarding
against the risk of perverse apocalyptic politics**]{.underline}**.** In
the end, [much of the normative work of political realism is about
cultivating the art of living through catastrophe without
apocalyptically surrendering to it.]{.underline} The experiences of the
thinkers in this book suggest that, regardless of the strategy one
ultimately adopts, **[this is a practice to which one must repeatedly
recommit without any reliable hope of success.]{.underline}**

[Over the past decade, [the **"cult of irrelevance"**]{.mark} in
political science]{.underline} scholarship [[has been lamented]{.mark}
by a growing chorus]{.underline} (Putnam 2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009).
[Prominent scholars]{.underline} of international affairs [have
diagnosed]{.underline} the roots of [the gap]{.underline} between
academia and policymaking, [made the case for why]{.underline} political
science [research is valuable for policymaking, and offered]{.underline}
a number of [ideas]{.underline} for enhancing the policy relevance of
scholarship in international relations and comparative politics (Walt
2005,2011; Mead 2010; Van Evera 2010; Jentleson and Ratner 2011;
Gallucci 2012; Avey and Desch 2014). Building on these insights,
[several initiatives have been formed]{.underline} in the attempt to
"bridge the gap."2 [Many]{.underline} of the specific efforts put in
place by these projects [focus on providing scholars with the skills,
platforms, and networks to better communicate]{.underline} the [findings
and implications]{.underline} of their research [to the policymaking
community]{.underline}, a necessary and worthwhile objective for a field
in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and publishing
norms tend more and more toward the abstract and esoteric. [Yet
enhancing communication]{.underline} between scholars and policymakers
[is only [one component]{.mark}]{.underline} of bridging the gap between
international affairs theory and practice. [Another]{.underline} crucial
component of this bridge [[is]{.mark} the generation of **substantive
[research programs]{.mark}** [that are]{.mark} actually [policy
relevant]{.mark}]{.underline}---a challenge to which less concerted
attention has been paid. The dual challenges of bridging the gap are
especially acute for graduate students, a particular irony since many
enter the discipline with the explicit hope of informing policy. [In a
field that has an admirable devotion to pedagogical self-reflection,
**strikingly little attention** is paid to techniques for **generating
policy-relevant ideas** for]{.underline} dissertation and other
[research topics]{.underline}. Although numerous articles and conference
workshops are devoted to the importance of experiential and
problem-based learning, especially through techniques of simulation that
emulate policymaking processes (Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow
2012; Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014), little has been written about the use
of such techniques for generating and developing innovative research
ideas. [This article outlines an experiential and problem-based approach
to]{.underline} developing a [political science research]{.underline}
program [using scenario analysis]{.underline}. It focuses especially on
illuminating the research generation and pedagogical benefits of this
technique by describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era
Foreign Policy Conference (NEFPC), which brings together doctoral
students of international and comparative affairs who share a
demonstrated interest in policy-relevant scholarship.3 In the
introductory section, the article outlines the practice of scenario
analysis and considers the utility of the technique in political
science. We argue that scenario analysis should be viewed as a tool to
stimulate problem-based learning for doctoral students and discuss the
broader scholarly benefits of using scenarios to help generate research
ideas. The second section details the manner in which NEFPC deploys
scenario analysis. The third section reflects upon some of the concrete
scholarly benefits that have been realized from the scenario format. The
fourth section offers insights on the pedagogical potential associated
with using scenarios in the classroom across levels of study. A brief
conclusion reflects on the importance of developing specific techniques
to aid those who wish to generate political science scholarship of
relevance to the policy world. What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in
Political Science? [[Scenario analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} is perceived
most commonly as a technique for examining the robustness of strategy.
It [[can immerse decision makers in future states]{.mark} that go
[beyond]{.mark} conventional [extrapolations of current trends]{.mark},
preparing them to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to
protect themselves from adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The
global petroleum company Shell, a pioneer of the technique,
characterizes scenario analysis as the art of considering "what if"
questions about possible future worlds. [Scenario [analysis is]{.mark}
thus **[typically seen as serving]{.mark} the purposes of [corporate
planning]{.mark}** or as a policy tool]{.underline} to be used in
combination with simulations of decision making. [[Yet scenario analysis
is **not**]{.mark} **inherently [limited to these
uses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This section]{.underline} provides a brief
overview of the practice of scenario analysis and the motivations
underpinning its uses. It then [makes a case for the utility of the
technique for political science scholarship]{.underline} and describes
how the scenarios deployed at NEFPC were created. The Art of Scenario
Analysis [[We characterize scenario analysis as]{.mark} the art of
[juxtaposing]{.mark} current [trends]{.mark} in unexpected combinations
in order [to **articulate**]{.mark} **surprising and yet plausible
futures**]{.underline}, often [referred to as [**"alternative worlds."**
Scenarios are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [**explicitly [not
forecasts]{.mark} or projections [based on linear]{.mark}
extrapolations** of contemporary [patterns]{.mark}, and [they are
**not**]{.mark} **hypothesis-based [expert predictions]{.mark}**[.
**Nor**]{.mark} **should they be equated with [simulations]{.mark}**,
which are]{.underline} best characterized as [functional representations
of **real institutions** or decision-making processes]{.underline} (Asal
2005). [Instead, [they are **depictions of possible**]{.mark} **future
[states]{.mark}** of the world]{.underline}, offered [together
[with]{.mark} a narrative of the **[driving causal
forces]{.mark}**]{.underline} and potential exogenous shocks [that could
lead to those futures]{.underline}. Good scenarios thus rely on explicit
causal propositions that, independent of one another, are
plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way. While
scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic planning
during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary practice
are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and early 1970s
(Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially initiated at
Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the usual
forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector. Building on
its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013). [Several features make
scenario analysis particularly useful for policymaking]{.underline}.5
[Long-term global trends across a number of different
realms]{.underline}---social, technological, environmental, economic,
and political---[combine in often-unexpected ways to produce unforeseen
challenges. Yet [the ability of decision makers to]{.mark} imagine, let
alone [prepare for, discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline} in the policy
realm [[is constrained by]{.mark} their [existing]{.mark} mental [models
and]{.mark} maps. This limitation is exacerbated by **well-known
[cognitive bias tendencies]{.mark}** such as groupthink and confirmation
bias]{.underline} (Jervis 1976; Janis 1982; Tetlock 2005). [The power of
[scenarios]{.mark} lies in their ability to [help individuals **break
out of**]{.mark} **conventional [modes of thinking]{.mark}** and
analysis by introducing unusual combinations of trends and deliberate
discontinuities in narratives about the future. [Imagining alternative
future worlds through]{.mark} a [**structured analytical process**
enables policymakers to]{.mark} envision and thereby **[adapt to
something]{.mark} altogether [different]{.mark}** from the known
present]{.underline}. Designing Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry
The characteristics of scenario analysis that commend its use to
policymakers also make it well suited to helping political scientists
generate and develop policy-relevant research programs. [Scenarios are
essentially textured, plausible, and relevant stories that help us
imagine how the future]{.underline} political-economic world [could be
different from the past]{.underline} in a manner that highlights policy
challenges and opportunities. For example, terrorist organizations are a
known threat that have captured the attention of the policy community,
yet our responses to them tend to be linear and reactive. Scenarios that
explore how seemingly unrelated vectors of change---the rise of a new
peer competitor in the East that diverts strategic attention, volatile
commodity prices that empower and disempower various state and nonstate
actors in surprising ways, and the destabilizing effects of climate
change or infectious disease pandemics---can be useful for illuminating
the nature and limits of the terrorist threat in ways that may be missed
by a narrower focus on recognized states and groups. By illuminating the
potential strategic significance of specific and yet poorly understood
opportunities and threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial
gaps in our collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends
and dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social
science scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality
itself. [Very simply, [scenario analysis can throw]{.mark} into
[sharp]{.mark} relief often-[overlooked]{.mark} yet pressing
[questions]{.mark} in international affairs that demand focused
investigation]{.underline}. [Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in
principle, [an innovative tool for developing a political science
research agenda]{.underline}. In practice, [achieving this objective
requires careful tailoring of the approach]{.underline}. The specific
scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to
provide a structured experiential process for generating problem-based
research questions with contemporary international policy relevance.6
The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described
here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global
affairs. Consensus was not the goal; on the contrary, some of these
causal statements represented competing theories about global change
(e.g., a resurgence of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing
forces). A major principle underpinning the transformation of these
causal drivers into possible future worlds was to "simplify, then
exaggerate" them, before fleshing out the emerging story with more
details.7 Thus, the contours of the future world were drawn first in the
scenario, with details about the possible pathways to that point filled
in second. It is entirely possible, indeed probable, that some of the
causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so
much as to be implausible, and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our
own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios. One of
the great strengths of scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario
discussions themselves, as described below, lay bare these especially
implausible claims and systematic biases.8 An explicit methodological
approach underlies the written scenarios themselves as well as the
analytical process around them---that of case-centered, structured,
focused comparison, intended especially to shed light on new causal
mechanisms (George and Bennett 2005). [The use of scenarios is similar
to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies certain variables in a
given situation in order to analyze the resulting effects]{.underline}
(Fearon 1991). [Whereas counterfactuals are traditionally
retrospective]{.underline} in nature and explore events that did not
actually occur in the context of known history, our [**[scenarios are
deliberately forward-looking]{.mark}** and]{.underline} are [designed to
**explore potential futures**]{.underline} that could unfold. As such,
counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to identifying how
individual events might expand or shift the "funnel of choices"
available to political actors and thus lead to different historical
outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while forward-looking scenario analysis can
better illuminate surprising intersections and sociopolitical dynamics
without the perceptual constraints imposed by fine-grained historical
knowledge. [We see scenarios as a complementary resource for exploring
these dynamics in international affairs, rather than as a
replacement]{.underline} for counterfactual analysis, historical case
studies, or other methodological tools. In the scenario process
developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios are employed, acting as
cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario, as detailed below,
includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which represent hypotheses
about causal mechanisms worth investigating in evolving international
affairs. The scenario analysis process itself employs templates
(discussed further below) to serve as a graphical representation of a
structured, focused investigation and thereby as the research tool for
conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George and Bennett 2005).
In essence, these templates articulate key observable implications
within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as a framework
for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba 1994).
Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis for the
cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that leads
directly to the articulation of new research agendas. [The scenario
process described here has thus been carefully designed to offer some
guidance to policy-oriented graduate students who are otherwise left to
the relatively unstructured norms by which political
science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance. [The scenario
approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the belief that
these traditional approaches can be complemented by [identifying
questions]{.mark} likely to be [of great empirical importance]{.mark} in
the real world, even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles
[**in existing research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events. The scenarios]{.underline} analyzed at NEFPC [envision
alternative worlds that could develop in the medium]{.underline} (five
to seven year) [term and are designed to **tease out issues scholars and
policymakers may encounter** in the]{.underline} relatively [near future
so that they can **begin thinking critically about them
now**]{.underline}. [This timeframe offers a period distant enough from
the present as to avoid falling into current events analysis, but not so
far into the future as to seem like science fiction]{.underline}. In
imagining the worlds in which these scenarios might come to pass,
[[participants learn **strategies for avoiding failures of creativity**
and]{.mark} for **[overturning]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
[[**assumptions** that prevent scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} and
analysts [[from]{.mark} anticipating and [understanding]{.mark} the
**[pivotal junctures]{.mark}** that arise in international
affairs]{.underline}.

### Predictions Enable Criticism

#### Descriptive theories of the world enable effective criticisms -- anything else devolves into subjective interpretations of reality that [never]{.underline} match criticism -- the aff is a better method.

**[A normative commitment to the oppressed must entail a commitment to
truth and objectivity, because true ideas are in the interest of the
oppressed, false ideas are in the interest of the
oppressors]{.underline}**. In other words, **[the best way to declare
solidarity with the oppressed is to declare one's commitment to
objective inquiry]{.underline}** 32 . [As Nzongola-Ntalaja]{.underline}
(1986: 10) [has put it]{.underline}: [It is a question of whether one
analyses society from the standpoint of the **dominant groups**, who
**have a vested interest in mystifying** the way **society** works, or
from the standpoint of ordinary people, who have nothing to lose from
truthful analyses of their predicament]{.underline}. [The
**philosophical realist theory of science**, [objectivity and
explanatory critique]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[provides a]{.mark}n
**alternative [response to]{.mark} the relationship between [knowledge
and power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Instead of choosing perspectives
on]{.mark} the basis of our [ethical commitment]{.mark} to the cause of
the oppressed** and to emancipatory social change, **[we should choose
between contending ideas on the basis of which provides]{.mark} a better
account of [objective]{.mark} social [reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[This will inherently provide a critique of the ideologies
which]{.underline}, by virtue of their flawed account of the social
world, [serve the interests of the powerful]{.underline}. Exemplars of
explanatory critique in International Relations are provided in the work
of scholars such as Siba Grovogui, James Gathii, Anthony Anghie,
Bhupinder Chimni, Jacques Depelchin, Hilbourne Watson, Robert Vitalis,
Sankaran Krishna, Michel-Rolph Trouillot 33 . Their work provides
critiques of central categories, theories and discourses in the theory
and practice of IR and narratives of world history, including
assumptions about sovereignty, international society, international law,
global governance, the nature of the state. They expose the ideological
and racialised nature of central aspects of IR through a critical
examination of both the long historical trajectory of imperial
ideologies regarding colonized peoples, and the actual practices of
colonialism and decolonisation in the constitution of international
orders and local social conditions. Their work identifies the flaws in
current ideas by revealing how they systematically misrepresent or
ignore the actual history of social change in Africa, the Caribbean and
other regions of the Third World, both past and present -- during both
colonial and neo-colonial periods of the imperial world order. [Their
[work reveals how]{.mark} racism, violence, exploitation and
dispossession, [colonialism]{.mark} and neo-colonialism have [been
central to]{.mark} the making of contemporary international order and
contemporary doctrines of international [law,]{.mark} sovereignty and
rights, and how such themes are glaring in their absence from histories
and theories of international relations and international history.
Objective social knowledge which accurately depicts and explains social
reality has these qualities by virtue of its **relation to its object,
not its subject**]{.underline}. As Collier argues, "The science/ideology
distinction is an epistemological one, not a social one." (Collier 1979:
60). So, [for example, in the work of Grovogui, Gathii and Depelchin,
the general perspective]{.underline} and knowledge [of]{.underline}
conditions in and [the history of Africa might be due]{.underline}
largely [to the African social origins of the authors]{.underline}.
[However the judgement that their accounts are superior]{.underline} to
those of mainstream IR [rests not on the fact that the authors are
African, but on the greater adequacy of their accounts]{.underline}
[with respect to]{.underline} the actual [historical and contemporary
production of conditions and change in Africa]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} in the Third World. The
criteria for choosing their accounts over others derives from the
relation between the ideas and their objects (what they are about), not
from the relation between the ideas and their subjects (who produced
them). It is vital to retain explicitly some commitment to objectivity
in social inquiry, to the notion that the proper criterion for judging
ideas about the world lies in what they say about the world, not whose
ideas they are. [A fundamental [problem which
underli]{.mark}es]{.underline} the origin and reproduction of IR's
[[eurocentricity]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [the overwhelming
[dominance of ideas produced in]{.mark} and by [the west]{.mark}, and
the wilful]{.underline} and determined **[silencing of the voices and
histories of the colonised]{.underline}**. **[But the result of this
fundamental problem is flawed knowledge about the world]{.underline}**[.
**[Eurocentricity]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[is therefore a dual problem
concerning both the authors and the content of knowledge, and [cannot be
resolved through normative commitments]{.mark} alone]{.underline}**. It
is not only the voices of the colonised, but the histories of
colonialism, which have been glaring in their absence from the
discipline of International Relations. [[Overcoming
eurocentricity]{.mark} therefore requires not only concerted effort from
the centre to create space and listen to hitherto marginalised voices,
but **also [commitment to correcting]{.mark} the [flaws in]{.mark}
prevailing [knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- **[[and it is not only
'the Other' who]{.mark} can and [should]{.mark} elaborate this
[critique]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A vitally important implication of
objectivity is that **[it is the responsibility of European and
American, just as much as non-American or non-European scholars, to
decolonise IR]{.underline}**. [The importance of
[objectivity]{.mark}]{.underline} in social inquiry defended here
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps **[[be seen as]{.mark} a form of
[epistemological internationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is not
necessary to be African to attempt to tell a more accurate account of
the history of Europe's role in the making of the contemporary
Africa]{.underline}** and the rest of the world, for example, [or to
write counter-histories of 'the]{.underline} expansion of international
society' which detail the [systematic barbarity of]{.underline}
so-called [Western civilisation]{.underline}. It is not necessary to
have been colonised to recognise and document the violence, racism,
genocide and dispossession which have characterised European expansion
over five hundred years.

### K2 Stop Aggression Now 

#### China exploits western fears of self-fulfilling prophecy- must send clear signals to stop aggression in the short term 

**Bosco, JD LLM Harvard, 16**

[There is the risk of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}.
If the United States and Japan base their policies on the expectation of
a powerful and aggressive China, and take preparatory measures that
Beijing interprets as a containment strategy, China might decide to
adopt aggressive policies to defend itself, leading to a cycle of
armament and tension that neither side desired. [China\'s leaders
clearly **understand this Western reticence** and **consistently exploit
it** to their advantage, **pressing at each incrementally assertive
point** and expecting the West to exercise the **necessary prudence** to
avoid confrontation and escalation.]{.underline} In the military and
security areas, [China has been deterred from direct aggression, but has
advanced its interests using **sophisticated forms of military
coercion** and simple gunboat diplomacy, as well as a wide range of
nonmilitary activities. The paper repeats the conventional wisdom that
China sees \"the need for a peaceful international
environment\"]{.underline} in order to pursue its domestic economic
development. **[But Beijing relies on an acquiescent and somewhat
intimidated neighborhood to ensure the peace while it pursues its
ambitious goals by means just short of outright war]{.underline}**. [The
ink was hardly dry on the SPF report when fresh news arrived of an even
more threatening move by China on its islands]{.underline}: the
installation of anti-ship missiles that will constrain activities of the
U.S. and Japanese navies among others. As the Obama and Abe
administrations digest this important SPF report, they will hopefully
recognize that [**the more powerful and aggressive China is already
here**. The future is now, and it is dire unless U.S]{.underline}. and
Japanese **[policymakers send some strong deterrence and dissuasion
messages to China, backed up by meaningful actions]{.underline}**. At
the very least, that means regular freedom of navigation and overflight
operations in the East and South China Seas that actually challenge
China\'s unlawful sovereignty claims---not merely innocent passages
which effectively reinforce them.

In 2011, I argued in a book entitled America's Challenge: Engaging a
Rising China in the TwentyFirst Century, that, [while Washington and
Beijing are by no means fated to enter into a hot or even a cold war,
the competing assumptions they hold r]{.underline}egarding the necessary
conditions for longterm stability and prosperity in Asia, if not
moderated through a process of mutual accommodation, [would likely
result in steady movement toward a zerosum, adversarial
mindset.]{.underline} I wrote that this dynamic could eventually
polarize the region and undermine the goals of continued peace and
prosperity toward which all sides strive. [Unfortunately, in the past
three years, this type of **mindset has deepened, in and out of both
governments and across much of Asia**.]{.underline} Indeed[,
the]{.underline} international [media,]{.underline} [along with a
coterie of regional and international relations specialists,
increasingly seem to interpret every action taken by one
government]{.underline}, no matter how small, [as being]{.underline} by
necessity [designed to diminish the position of the other]{.underline}.
Even more worrisome, [**this deepening mindset is driving policy
statements** and recommendations in Beijing and Washington that serve to
reinforce and strengthen, rather than moderate, the differences between
the two sides.]{.underline} While China's leader, Xi Jinping, speaks of
the need to develop an "Asia for Asians" and to create a new regional
security architecture as an alternative to the "Cold War era" U.S.led
bilateral alliance structure, American policymakers and analysts
criticize Beijing for establishing an air defense identification zone
(ADIZ) in the East China Sea of the sort long possessed by Washington
and Tokyo and encourage other Asian states to resist joining
Chineseinitiated economic institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank.

**[This should not be surprising to anyone who understands modern
Chinese history and great power transitions]{.underline}**. [Beijing has
an ongoing]{.underline} and likely longterm and [deep incentive to work
with the United States]{.underline} and the West to sustain continued,
mutually beneficial economic growth and to address a growing array of
common global and regional concerns, from pandemics to climate change
and terrorism[. At the same time, it understandably wishes to reduce its
vulnerability to potential future threats from the United States and
other politically and militarily strong nations,]{.underline} while
increasing its overall influence along its strategically important
maritime periphery. [As Beijing's overseas power and influence grow, its
foreign interests expand, and its domestic nationalist backers become
more assertive, it will naturally become less willing to accept or
acquiesce in international political and economic relationships, norms,
and power structures that it believes disproportionately and unjustly
favor Western powers]{.underline}; put China at a strategic, political,
or economic disadvantage; or generally fail to reflect movement toward a
more multipolar global and regional power structure. [It will also
likely become more fearful that a declining]{.underline} (in relative
terms) [Washington will regard an increasingly influential China as a
threat to be countered through ever more forceful or deliberate
measures.]{.underline} Indeed, this view is already widespread among
many Chinese observers. **[One does not need to cast Beijing as an evil
or predatory entity to understand the forces driving such
beliefs]{.underline}**. [They stem from national selfinterest,
historical insecurity]{.underline} (and nationalist pride), [suspicion,
fear, and uncertainty]{.underline}. [To some degree, they also stem from
a level of opportunism, driven in part by fear, but also in part by the
understandable desire to take advantage of China's growing regional and
global influence and America's apparent relative decline in order to
strengthen Chinese leverage in possible future disputes.]{.underline}

Second, [some may say]{.underline} that [the analysis]{.underline} and
policy recommendations in this report [**are too pessimistic**, based on
a worst-case appraisal of Chinese behavior.]{.underline} [To the
contrary, we draw our conclusions from China's current actions regarding
its internal and external security, its neighbors, and U.S. presence in
Asia]{.underline}. **[We project nothing that is not already apparent in
China's present policies and strategic intentions]{.underline}**.

behave like the Soviet Union]{.underline}, necessitating something far
more costly than balancing. The word "containment" comes to mind, and we
certainly do not recommend that vis-à-vis China in current
circumstances, not least because no Asian nation would join in such an
endeavor. (34-5)

### China Revisionist 

#### China is revisionist -- BRI and IMF expansion prove they're willing and capable to revise the international order 

**Wilson, PhD, 19**

(Jeanne L., Ph.D., Political Science, Indiana University. \"Are Russia
and China revisionist states?\", Asia Dialogue, 6-11-2019,
https://theasiadialogue.com/2019/06/11/are-russia-and-china-revisionist-states/,
7-20-2019) //bc

In the past few years, **[Russia and China have increasingly been
referred to as revisionist powers]{.underline}**. For example, [both the
United States' 2017 National Security Strategy and the United States'
2018 National Defence Strategy]{.underline} [identify]{.underline}
[Russia and]{.underline} **[China as revisionist states]{.underline}**.
The concept of revisionism encompasses various meanings that typically
distinguish between states that accept the status quo distribution of
power in the international system and those which seek to alter it to
their advantage. Here, I am primarily concerned with the extent to which
Russia and China challenge the implicit assumptions that underpin the
norms and values of what might be referred to as the international
community in the English School sense of the term. I argue that Russia
and China are not revisionist but rather neo-revisionist states.
However, [it is China]{.underline} rather than Russia [that is more
likely substantively]{.underline} [to challenge the status]{.underline}
[quo]{.underline} **[and assume the position of a full-blown revisionist
power in the future.]{.underline}** Both Western analysts and
policymakers have identified a litany of Russian and Chinese behaviour
that indicates nonconformance to what is portrayed as universal norms
and values. In fact, Russia and [China contest a set of neoliberal
practices that have evolved in the post-World War Two international
order]{.underline}. [Foremost]{.underline} amongst these [is the
evolution of human rights as a universal value]{.underline} that
legitimizes intervention in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state
(although Russia has made use of the rhetoric of the "responsibility to
protect" to justify its activities in the post-Soviet space). Russia and
China similarly view the West's elevation of liberal democracy as a
universal ideal as a subterfuge for the fomenting of Colour Revolutions
that seek regime change in noncompliant targeted states. At the same
time, Russia and China accept and in fact continuously reaffirm their
commitment to a number of fundamental precepts of the international
order. These include the primacy of state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, the importance of international law, and the centrality of
the United Nations, particularly with respect to the key role of the
United Nations Security Council. It must be acknowledged that Russian
and [Chinese promotion of these concepts does not necessarily provide a
reliable guide to their foreign policy behaviour]{.underline} (although
the same criticism can be lodged against countless other states). Russia
and China also actively participate in aspects of global governance,
placing an emphasis on the United Nations as the ultimate source of
international authority. Both states have signed a number of United
Nations Conventions and Covenants including the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights. They are members of a number of
multilateral and regional structures (although Russia has been suspended
from participation in the G-7). The two states stress their commitment
to the maintenance of global and regional security supporting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the non-militarization of space,
and the need to fight terrorism. Critically, Russia and China act as
rule takers rather than challengers in their participation in the global
financial institutions. China, in particular, has emerged as a vocal
supporter of globalization and free trade in conspicuous contrast to the
United States in the Trump administration. Russia and China's view of
the operation of the international system conforms in a large part to
Westphalian precepts, while rejecting the West's more recent adoption of
humanitarian and individualistic norms and values (which in fact exist
in a state of uneasy tension with the traditional assumptions of the
Westphalian order). In this sense, Russia and China are neo-revisionist
rather than revisionist states. [Under]{.underline} the [Xi
Jinping]{.underline} leadership, [**China has adopted a more assertive
foreign policy** that]{.underline}, in contrast to the behaviour of past
leadership, [confidently asserts China's status as a great
power]{.underline}. On the one hand, [**this is reflected in the State's
efforts to readjust China's role in international structures,** as seen
in the attempt to expand its decision-making power within the
I]{.underline}nternational [M]{.underline}onetary [F]{.underline}und.
This sort of behaviour, however, takes place within the boundaries of
the contemporary international community. On the other hand,
[China's]{.underline} launching of the Belt and Road Initiative
([BRI]{.underline}) in 2013 **[can be viewed as offering an alternative
vision of global governance]{.underline}** [that challenges the approach
promoted by the hegemonic Western powers]{.underline}. Beijing has
offered a number of rationales for BRI which are in themselves at least
in part persuasive. This massive infrastructure project [can be seen as
a means of developing China's Western]{.underline} [regions, utilizing
surplus capital and providing employment]{.underline}, [extending
Chinese export markets, and securing domestic energy
supplies.]{.underline} Generally speaking, the Chinese leadership has
sought to downplay the strategic and geopolitical implications of BRI.
In fact, the BRI is closely associated with two rather amorphous
concepts: the "Community of Common Destiny" (minyun gongtongti) and the
"Silk Road Spirit" (silu Jingshen). The Community of Common Destiny
relies on a sort of updating of Confucianism (that is also reminiscent
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) to stress mutual
benefit, friendship, equality, and win-win outcomes. The Silk Road
Spirit provides a parallel emphasis on inclusivity that emphasizes the
right of all states to choose their own social systems, a pointed
rejection of the democracy and human rights agenda of the hegemonic
West. [Although the initial focus of BRI and the Community of Common
Destiny is regional]{.underline}, the **[long-term implications are
global.]{.underline}** The BRI and the Community of Common Destiny
potentially posit a Sinocentric global community that locates China at
its epicentre. [Whereas Russia lacks the material capabilities to
propose an alternative framework]{.underline} [to the contemporary
global system]{.underline}, **[such restrictions do not apply to
China]{.underline}**. To be sure, the success of the BRI is by no means
assured but the project has multiple adverse implications to the
continued ability of the West to set the rules of discourse and
behaviour in the international community. The Western response to a
rising China has largely been an effort to socialize China into the
norms and values of the US-led international order. But C**[hina
increasingly possesses the potential ability to remake the international
community in its own image. To do so would indicate China's true status
as a revisionist power.]{.underline}**

More generally, [there is considerable evidence that Chinese leaders
would like to develop the capability to push the U.S. Navy beyond the
"first island chain,"]{.underline} [which is usually taken to
include]{.underline} the Greater Sunda Islands, Japan, the Philippines,
and **[Taiwan]{.underline}**. If this were to happen, [China would be
able to seal off the East China Sea]{.underline}, [the South China Sea,
and the Yellow Sea]{.underline}, and it would be almost impossible for
the U.S. Navy to reach Korea in the event of war. [There is even talk in
China about eventually pushing the U.S. Navy beyond the "second island
chain]{.underline}," which runs from the eastern coast of Japan to Guam
and then down to the Moluccan Islands. It would also include the small
island groups like the Bonin, Caroline, and Marianas Islands. [If the
Chinese were successful, Japan and the Philippines would be cut off from
American naval support]{.underline}. **[These ambitious goals make good
strategic sense for China]{.underline}** (although this is not to say
China will necessarily be able to achieve them). [Beijing should want a
militarily weak and isolated India, Japan, and Russia as its
neighbors]{.underline}, just as the United States prefers a militarily
weak Canada and Mexico on its borders. What state in its right mind
would want other powerful countries located in its region? All Chinese
surely remember what happened over the last century when Japan was
powerful and China was weak. Furthermore, **[why would a powerful China
accept U.S. military forces operating in its backyard]{.underline}**?
American policymakers object when other great powers send military
forces into the Western Hemisphere, because they view those foreign
forces as potential threats to American security. The same logic should
apply to China. [Why would China feel safe with U.S. forces deployed on
its doorstep?]{.underline} Following the logic of the Monroe Doctrine,
**[would not China's security be better served by pushing the American
military out of the Asia­Pacific region]{.underline}**? [All Chinese
surely remember what happened in the hundred years between the First
Opium War]{.underline} (1839--42) [and the end of World War
II]{.underline} (1945), [when the United States and the European great
powers took advantage of a weak China]{.underline} and not only violated
its sovereignty but also imposed unfair treaties on it and exploited it
economically. [Why should we expect China to act differently than the
United States]{.underline}? [Are the Chinese more principled than we
are? More ethical? Are they less nationalistic? Less concerned about
their survival? They are none of these things,]{.underline} of course,
which **[is why China is likely to follow basic realist
logic]{.underline}** [and attempt to become a regional hegemon in
Asia.]{.underline} Although maximizing its prospects of survival is the
principal reason China will seek to dominate Asia, there is another
reason, related to Beijing's territorial disputes with some of its
neighbors. As Taylor Fravel points out, China has managed to settle most
of its border conflicts since 1949---seventeen out of twenty­three---in
good part because it has been willing to make some significant
concessions to the other side. Nevertheless, China has six outstanding
territorial disagreements, and there is little reason---at least at this
juncture---to think the involved parties will find a clever diplomatic
solution to them. **[Probably China's most important dispute is over
Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[which Beijing is deeply committed to making an
integral part of China once again]{.underline}**. The present government
on [Taiwan]{.underline}, however, [believes it is a sovereign country
and has no interest in being reintegrated into China.]{.underline}
Taiwanese leaders do not advertise their independence, for fear it will
provoke China to invade Taiwan. In addition, [China has ongoing disputes
with Vietnam over control of the Paracel Islands in the South China
Sea,]{.underline} and with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan,
and Vietnam over the Spratly Islands, which are also located in the
South China Sea. More generally, **[China maintains that it has
sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, a]{.underline}**
[claim disputed not only by its neighbors but by the United States as
well.]{.underline} Farther to the north in the East China Sea, Beijing
has a bitter feud with Japan over who controls a handful of small
islands that Tokyo calls the Senkaku Islands and China labels the Diaoyu
Islands. Finally, [China has land border disputes with Bhutan and India.
In]{.underline} fact, China and India fought a war over the disputed
territory in 1962, and the two sides have engaged in provocative actions
on numerous occasions since then. For example, New Delhi maintains there
were 400 Chinese incursions into Indian­controlled territory during 2012
alone; and in mid­April 2013, Chinese troops---for the first time since
1986--- refused to return to China after they were discovered on the
Indian side of the Line of Actual Control. It appears that China has
been stepping up its cross­border raids inrecent years in response to
increased Indian troop deployments and an accompanying growth in
infrastructure. [Given the importance of these territorial disputes to
China]{.underline}, [coupled with the apparent difficulty of resolving
them through the give­and­take of diplomacy]{.underline}, **[the best way
for China to settle them on favorable terms is probably via
coercion]{.underline}**. Specifically, a [China that is much more
powerful than any of its neighbors will be in a good position to use
military threats **to force the other side to accept a deal largely on
China's terms**]{.underline}. And if that does not work, China can
always unsheathe the sword and go to war to get its way.
**[It]{.underline}** **[seems likely that coercion or the actual use of
force is the only plausible way China is going to regain
Taiwan]{.underline}**. In short, [becoming a regional hegemon is the
best pathway for China to resolve its various territorial disputes on
favorable terms.]{.underline}

### Securitization Good 

#### Our framing of war is good and true -- we describe *[objective existential threats]{.underline}* -- China has both the motivation and the capability to wage war with Taiwan.

Objective existential threats are threats to the existence of actors and
orders regardless of whether anyone has realized this. To give an
example, [suppose I am exposed to lethal levels of radiation in an area
where radiation levels are not normally checked,]{.underline} which
leaves my exposure undetected. [Given that I can neither smell nor see
radiation]{.underline}, I [am unlikely to be aware of it, yet my
obliviousness is not going to save my life.]{.underline} [Objective
existential threats become matters of security,]{.underline} and
therefore 'security threats', **[only when a powerful actor frames and
responds to them as such.]{.underline}** Importantly, not all objective
existential threats become security issues: Some are treated as health
issues, others as police matters, and some may well be ignored. The
reverse also holds, and not everything that is securitized necessarily
refers to an objective existential threat; some security threats refer
to perceived threats only. **[Securitization can be justified as the
right thing to do only if it refers to an objective existential
threat]{.underline}**. This is because [the killing of innocent
persons]{.underline} (directly or as 'collateral damage') [that might
well be an extraordinary measure resulting from securitization cannot be
morally justified unless there is an objective existential
threat]{.underline}. Once again, the storm that has erupted over the
2003 Iraq invasion is a case in point. Here, precisely the fact that
lies about the existence of weapons of mass destruction artificially
heightened the acuteness of the threat renders the whole endeavour and
its consequences morally untenable. [How]{.underline}, then, [can we
find out whether a securitization refers to an objective existential
threat or merely to a perceived threat]{.underline}? First, [we need to
figure out whether the aggressor really intends to destroy a given
referent object.]{.underline} Second, [we need to examine whether or not
the aggressor has the means]{.underline} (capability) to do so.4 It
should be clear that both of these conditions will have to be met at the
same time.5 In the absence of any intention to harm A, the capabilities
of B pose no danger to A. And the absence or lack of capabilities
amounts to the same as insincerity. [Insincerity]{.underline} in turn
[renders the threat non-objective]{.underline}. In line with my revision
of securitization theory, outlined above, I propose that just [as we can
get at the intentions of securitizing actors]{.underline}, we [can get
at the intentions of aggressors by comparing what they say with what
they do]{.underline}. And, by 'doing' I mean a relevant behavioural
change made by the aggressor, or by some entity instructed by the
aggressor, in response to the threat. [Discrepancies]{.underline}
[between what aggressors say and the actions they subsequently take to
follow through on a threat are vital]{.underline}, as they suggest
insincerity. Having assessed the intentions of aggressors, we need to
continue by assessing their capabilities. Within a state-centric
context, traditionalists have made advances that are instructive for our
purposes. [Zeev Moaz]{.underline} (2009), for example, [assesses
capabilities by examining the level of manpower an aggressor has
available for military service,]{.underline} [along with its weapons
capability, military budget, population size and political
capacity]{.underline} to mobilize for national security. Capability
assessment is easier in the context of the state, where data are more
freely available, including from independent sources. In a non-state
context, however, the analyst will have to try to figure out things such
as the size of the aggressor (how many people subscribe to the cause),
what the aggressor has done in the past, what kinds of
states/organizations it is friendly with, and what we know about the
latter. To illustrate how we might proceed, let us consider the case of
Al-Qaeda and whether it poses an objective existential threat to
civilians in the West. Like most terrorist organizations, Al-Qaeda's
leadership has never made a secret of its intentions, having called on
all Muslims to kill all Americans and their allies in order to liberate
Islamic countries (Bin Laden, 2006: 296). A series of
[bombings]{.underline}/attacks [provides conclusive evidence that they
are sincere]{.underline}, as their words are matched by actions. These
attacks also leave us with ideas about the organization's capabilities:
[not only do they show ingenuity insofar as Al-Qaeda has transformed
conventional means]{.underline} (passenger airplanes) [into
weapons]{.underline}, [they also show that the organization's biggest
capability consists of human beings prepared to die for the
cause]{.underline}. To summarize, as long as Al-Qaeda's intentions do
not change and as long as they are able to recruit new potential suicide
bombers, they constitute an objective existential threat to at least
some civilians in the West. Objective existential threat analysis is not
easy. Importantly, discourse analysis of publically available texts
alone may not suffice here; instead, [researchers might have to conduct
interviews with relevant people]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, if
possible, [analyse documents that are not in the public
domain]{.underline}.6 Given this, it will be much easier to judge the
morality of securitizations with hindsight, when information tends to be
more freely available.

### Realism True 

#### Conflicting Chinese and Taiwanese strategic goals and motives make violent confrontation in the strait highly likely

[What does it mean to say 'the China-Taiwan relationship']{.underline}?
For [a structural realist there]{.underline} is an [obvious reality with
respect to Taiwan]{.underline}, [but it begins with the US and the
PRC,]{.underline} which are both concerned with the potential damage
that the other could do to their national security and economies.14
[These concerns result from each nation-state's desire to dominate the
politics and economics of the region, and]{.underline} both possess
substantial resources in this regard, including large numbers and types
of military weapons, large portions of their citizenry engaged in their
militaries, sizeable economies, vast networks of trading partners and
linkages, and considerable financial resources and influence. [Given the
military]{.underline} [resources each possesses]{.underline}, combined
with the trade linkages they have developed with one another, [both
nation-states seek to avoid direct military confrontations with one
another]{.underline}. **[Yet they also simultaneously seek to balance
one another's military and economic power]{.underline}** [in order to
avoid any advantage the other might accrue]{.underline} in their
competition for regional domination. [From a structural realist
perspective, Taiwan represents a third and relatively weaker entity in
the mix]{.underline}. [For the PRC, Taiwan represents unfinished
business.]{.underline}15 Originally a province of China, Taiwan is an
island 100 miles off the coast of China's Fukien province, and the body
of water that separates them, the Taiwan Strait, is a major commercial
shipping avenue. Taiwan had been annexed to and occupied by the Japanese
from 1895 until 1945 when it was returned to China. When the
decades-long Chinese civil war culminated in a communist victory over
the mainland in 1949, remnants of the US-supported Nationalists
(Kuomintang or KMT) escaped to the island and established their own
government, the Republic of China (ROC). From its inception, the ROC was
intended to be a temporary solution. The Nationalists argued that they
were the sole legitimate government of China and insisted that they
would some day re-conquer the mainland. Meanwhile the PRC made plans to
reclaim Taiwan after it had consolidated power on the mainland. What
prevented this invasion was the US interest in balancing Chinese
aggression in light of the Korean War. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s
Taiwan became the cornerstone in the US Cold War containment strategy in
Asia. [The US sent naval forces into the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}
[several times in response to Chinese provocations]{.underline}, it
[supplied the ROC]{.underline} [with economic aid]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} it [signed a mutual defense treaty]{.underline} with
it in 1954. This Cold War context changed by the early 1970s, however,
as China had by then developed a mutual interest with the US in
counter-balancing the Soviet Union, and the US and China explored the
possibility of improved relations. In 1979 the US established full
diplomatic relations with the PRC, terminated its 1954 mutual security
pact with Taiwan, and reaffirmed the one-China principle that there is
only one China and Taiwan is a part of it. Simultaneously, however, [the
US adopted the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act]{.underline}, which [declared
that the US has a commitment to Taiwan's security]{.underline} and is
obligated to sell sophisticated defensive arms to it. The US has also
consistently argued it has a right to protect Taiwan from the PRC, and
in 1996 it dispatched two aircraft carrier groups to the region in
response to Chinese military activities in the strait. The triangular
relationship between the US, the PRC, and the ROC is replete with
strategic deterrent calculations. [The US attempts to pacify China with
regards to Taiwan while also containing China and protecting Taiwan from
it. The PRC attempts to intimidate Taiwan while preventing direct US
involvement in their bilateral conflict]{.underline}. [And the ROC seeks
to maintain and increase its independence from China while being careful
not to alienate American support]{.underline}. This [trilateral
structural relationship can]{.underline} [also be examined from a
neoclassical realist perspective,]{.underline} which focuses on the
domestic politics of these states. Competing [subgroups]{.underline}
within the US, the PRC, and the ROC [emphasise either cooperative
economic linkages]{.underline} or [militaristic policies in their
relationships with one another]{.underline}. The extent to which any of
these particular subgroups are in ascendance results from electoral
competition in the US and the ROC, and internal bureaucratic struggles
in the PRC.16 Taiwan's development into a full-fledged democracy in the
1990s has increased hostilities between the ROC and the PRC, because
[democratisation]{.underline} [allowed]{.underline} the main
pro-independence political party, [the]{.underline} Democratic
Progressive Party ([DPP]{.underline}), [to gain control over and utilise
state power]{.underline} [in the pursuit of its nationalist
policies]{.underline}. [Given neoclassical realism's concern with
non-systemic variables]{.underline}, **[the impact of identity formation
on intra-state politics in Taiwan is particularly
important.]{.underline}** The DPP and other pro-independence groups are
intimately linked to a Taiwanese identity that sees itself as distinct
from that of mainland China. These Taiwanese, who emigrated from
Mainland China before World War II and may be divided into two groups
(Hoklos and Hakkas) based on linguistic differences, constitute eighty
five percent of the population17 'Mainlanders' are the Mandarinspeaking
KMT who retreated to Taiwan after WWII; they constitute only fourteen
percent of the population. As long as the Nationalists prevailed
electorally, Taiwan pursued a foreign policy with China that subtly
mixed accommodation (including the public acceptance of the oneChina
principle) and resistance (such as pursuing sovereign membership in
IGOs). Under the DPP, on the other hand, [Taiwan has declared its
intention to become a full-fledged sovereign nation-state]{.underline}
within the next ten years; **[something the PRC has consistently
indicated it will use force to prevent.]{.underline}** [These internal
developments make conflict]{.underline} between the PRC and the ROC
[**even more likely than international structural considerations alone**
would have done]{.underline}. Given US strategic interests in the
region, [the Taiwan Strait is]{.underline}, as David Lampton, Director
of China Studies at John Hopkins observes, '[the only probable place
.]{.underline} . . [where two big nuclear powers could come into
conflict']{.underline}.18

#### Chinese expansion drives instability -- rising powers are seen as a threat to other major powers -- interdependence doesn't check.

**Kirshner, PhD, 12**

(Jonathan, B.A., Johns Hopkins University M.A., Princeton University
Ph.D., Princeton University. "The Tragedy of Offensive Realism:
Classical Realism and the Rise of China." European Journal of
International Relations, vol. 18, no. 1, Mar. 2012, pp. 53--75,
doi:10.1177/1354066110373949.)//bc

[Rising powers]{.underline} in particular, then, [are potential sources
of instability]{.underline} **[because the self-definition of their
interests will expand along with their increasing
capabilities]{.underline}** (and expectations of still greater power to
come); [classical realists also expect them to]{.underline}
[seek]{.underline} not just security, but also [status, prestige, and
even deference]{.underline} from others. In a world where power is
relative (and this is the way realists define power), that [extended
stride cannot help but encroach on someone else's toes]{.underline}. But
those others, unfortunately, may see it differently, and, from a realist
perspective, even [without being stepped on **other states cannot help
but be wary of a rising power**]{.underline}, [simply because it
represents]{.underline}, at the very least, [the possibility of a
threat]{.underline}. Thrown into this mix is the fact that [states often
disagree]{.underline} --- and not just about interests, but also about
narratives, history, legitimacy, justice, and assessments of relative
power under the greater uncertainties associated with economic change.
Thus [while realists attribute most conflicts to the clash of
interests]{.underline} --- rising powers with greater ambition, other
states that prefer to check those drives --- **[an additional problem is
that spiral-type conflicts are added on to that combustible
heap]{.underline}**, [often indistinguishably]{.underline}. It is a
realist cliche to appeal to Thucydides on this point, but the
plain-spoken clarity of the argument remains powerful: 'The growth of
the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Sparta, made
war inevitable' (Strassler, 1996: 26). Gilpin (1986: 306; 1989: 15, 19,
25--6) considers Thucydides to be the greatest of all the realist
writers, and in his estimation the most important contribution in The
Peloponnesian War is to have identified 'that the uneven growth of power
among states is the driving force of international relations.' All of
this applies to contemporary international politics --- to the rise of
China and the response of other states to that rise. [China is an
emerging great power]{.underline}; [it borders other major powers and is
implicated in a host of security issues; its demand for energy is a
potential source of political friction with other states]{.underline};
[and]{.underline}, most notably, it [is at the same time an important
strategic rival of]{.underline}, and intimately enmeshed economically
with, [the US]{.underline}. China benefits immensely from its ability to
access the American market; and its massive dollar holdings are a key
pillar of support for the stability of the US dollar, which in the eyes
of many observers rests upon otherwise shaky foundations.8 As
established above, [from a realist perspective,]{.underline} **[this is
not a pretty picture]{.underline}**. '[For realist
pessimists]{.underline},' Aaron Friedberg (2005: 17, 18--19) notes,
'**[the single most important feature of the PRC today is its rising
power]{.underline}**,' and this is seen through a lens of history that
focuses on the empirical regularity that rising powers, of all stripes,
have time and time again been troublemakers. With regard to the
consequences of China's rise, [the realist default setting must be
pessimistic]{.underline}: **[China's participation in international
agreements will be increasingly necessary for those agreements to have
meaning,]{.underline}** [but cooperation between strategic rivals will
be brittle;]{.underline} China's [economic interdependence]{.underline}
with the US **[will not inhibit political conflict]{.underline}** [or
even]{.underline} **[prevent war]{.underline}** [from breaking
out]{.underline} between them; China [will become more
ambitious]{.underline}, challenging the interests of other states. But,
crucially, while these expectations require classical realists to be
alarmed by the consequences of the rise of China, and to anticipate
increased international political friction as a result, it certainly
does not mean that war is inevitable, and it does not lead to the
prescription of superficially obvious policy recommendations. That
interdependence will not prevent war, for example --- a common realist
position --- does not mean that interdependence is a 'bad thing,' which
should be avoided. Rather, it is a condition with political
consequences, choices about which require political assessments.

## ME War Reps Good

### Realism True 

#### Realism accounts for all conflict in the Middle East and is the root cause of conflict

[Thucydides's complex realism showed a vision of the international order
as a State of War, where danger was perpetual. The Peloponnesian war was
analyzed as the inescapable competition between very different models
represented in the Delian Empire and the Peloponnesian
League.]{.underline} The ideological opposition of Athens, a sea and
trade power, and Sparta, a land and agricultural power, was this
["truest cause" we could also look for in the Syrian
Conflict.]{.underline} To a certain extent, the [conflict between the
Islamic State and the Syrian regime could be understood as a competition
based on radically opposed conceptions of the State.]{.underline} The
conflict can be thought through the "caliphate" itself. The Khalifat is
a theocratic regime where the caliph is the successor of Prophet
Muhammad and is amīr al-mu'minīn ("commander of the believers")\[2\].
Abou Bakr al-Baghdadi has been the Caliph of the ISIS since June
2014\[3\]. The Khalifat has no borders out of the Ummah (Islamic
community/commonwealth) and would aim, in theory, to spread all around
the world. [It is why the ISIS borders do not comply with just Syria or
Iraq.]{.underline} The Khalifat is ruled by the Sharia, defined
historically through the Quran, the hadith (compilation of words,
actions, habits of the prophet) and the sunna (tradition defined by the
prophet)\[4\]. This theocratic model is against the weberian and western
conception of the State, [whether in its authoritative version in
**Middle-East** or in its more democratic version in Europe. Michael
Doyle's **complex realism** allows us to focus on this opposition as the
origin of the war, involving armies such as jihadists, the Syrian army
and the International coalition.]{.underline} However, Thucydides
insisted on the hegemonic dimension of the military beyond religion and
moral. Considering war as a quest to become the global hegemon, he
foresaw that this kind of conflict was not reducible to a conflict
between secular and religious, but had other pragmatic dimensions,
political, economic and social. He also looked at the scale of the
individuals such as Alcibiades or the political majority in Athens. In
his sense, he can inspire us to think not only about States in the
Syrian conflict, but also about the rebels groups, the Kurdish groups
and the factions at power. After, Michael Doyle defined a realist
fundamentalism through the figure of Machiavelli. In his lessons for the
Prince, Machiavelli defined the virtù as the best quality, based on
ambitions, fears and interests\[5\]. According to him, the virtù is the
"glorious exercise of an individual's courageous ambition depend\[ing\]
on circumstances". Sometimes, be virtuous would mean to use war to
protect the State and to obtain the reward fortune\[6\]. Machiavelli
used the double image of "lion" and "foxes" to illustrate this
capability of the prince to be strong or smart, good or cruel, according
to the fortune. In a certain way, we can illustrate this
Machiavellianism by Bashar el-Assad's policy from the beginning of the
Arab springs in 2011. According to François Burgat, the Syrian Spring
was originally organized into peaceful movements\[7\]. The Aleppo
students had a major role in peaceful demonstrations. In April 2011,
five hundreds university demonstrators paraded with the slogan "Freedom
and Reform". This demonstration was repressed violently, with many
arrests. Many students were banned from continuing their studies at the
university and left Syria to study abroad. The first student martyr was
arrested and security officers stoned him on the spot. In June 2012,
tree medical school students were arrested because they tried to rescue
wounded protesters. Eight days later, their bodies were found in one of
the streets of Aleppo, completely burnt. The regime wanted to give a
lesson to the demonstrators and to give examples. It was a matter of
showing that manifesting signified dying under torture. Then, some
students wanted to come into contact with the free army to carry arms
and defend the demonstrations. The repression of the regime militarized
the demonstrations. [When the **free army** was integrated into Aleppo,
the regime responded with increasingly **intense bombardments**. The
dead were multiplying among the inhabitants. In January 2013, there was
a terrible massacre on the Aleppo River linking the liberated area and
the regime area: hundred bodies were found in the river.]{.underline}
They had their hands chained with a bullet in their heads. 70 to 80%
were recognized by their parents\[8\]. Bashar el-Assad considered
violence as necessary to avoid more violence, to protect the State from
the institutions of the insurrection. The Raison of State allowed him to
infringe fundamental human rights and moral principles. However,
intervening so unbalanced created an escalation. Bashar el-Assad was
unable to be virtuous enough to protect the State. Finally, the origin
of the Syrian civil war illustrated Robert Jervis's security dilemma,
when the use of violence to avoid violence can be a factor of incredibly
stronger violence and of the collapse of the State. Also, Michael Doyle
proposed to come back to Thomas Hobbes's theory of structuralism\[9\] to
study the conflicts. I[n his model, **states are functional similar
units** which are perpetually involved in a **war of "all against
all"**. This state of war is very close to the hobbesian state of
nature. Competition, diffidence and the search for glory drive the
actors to war. To restrict the conflicts, they can develop strategies of
cooperative security, but they will be confronted to hard dilemmas. The
wars are never completely prevented. The prisoner's dilemma will show
why two completely "rational" individuals might not cooperate, even if
it is in their best interest\[10\]]{.underline}. The stag-dilemma will
show that once you arme yourself to be prepared in case of war, you
paradoxically participate to the process which leads to war. Alliances
are prudent but often end in preventive wars because of those dilemmas.
More the international order is split between pols, more it is unstable
and facilitates war. There is no international law out of anarchy and
chaos. However, the State, as a Leviathan, needs to promote security in
any case. The contract made by the people is this security. It may leads
to war for national security. However, the best ways to distance the
conflict is to balance power inside and outside the alliances, and to
keep self-help. Thomas Hobbes also considered trade as a form of war. In
Syria, the civil war is the dissolution of the Syrian Leviathan. The
State has not been able to protect its citizens from violence, whether
it comes from the Islamic State, the Kurds, the kurdish parties of the
north or the International intervention. There have been 290.000 deads
since 2011\[11\] and around five millions have left the country\[12\].
[The groups involved on the civil war, especially the insurrection, are
so many it illustrates well **the chaotic state of nature**. Many actors
are involved in the all conflict making it impossible to build efficient
and durable cooperation. We talk obviously about the regime of Bashar
el-Assad, the groups of insurrection, the Syrian Kurdish Movement (PKK),
Jabhat al-Nosra, ISIS, and the very heterogeneous international
coalition.]{.underline} Syria is not at all self-help in a civil war
which is also fed by foreign interventions (funding, armees, logisitcs).
[The balance of power in Middle-East is impossible to build in this
epicenter of global conflicts where everyone has interests. One of the
solutions to go toward peace would be to **prevent foreign
interventions** whose first interest is rarely peace.]{.underline} Then,
Michael Doyle chose to categorize Rousseau's constitutionalism in the
realist theories. Rousseau was a democratic realist who believed in
states governed by free citizens according to a national interest.
Therefore, the state of war was considered as variable, depending on the
"social misery". He defined this as an unjust state with disunion
between force and law, where people must kill or be weakened.
International law is an illusion and peace through a collective security
is impossible because monarchs prefer the apparent interests, because
wars are a source of prestige for ministers and because the actors are
too many to cooperate. In Rousseau's theory, the State is an oppressor.
It is a place of "amour de soi" which has led people to a social
contract in favor of property, jealousy and violence. Though, they were
independent and felt compassion, "amour propre" and no fear in the state
of nature. Rousseau justifies a democratic revolution and a just social
contract (equality), as a rout to peace. For the international order, he
thinks in the democratic national interest to declare war only if
necessary and only against other states. In this way, Rousseau would
have defended the revolution in Syria considering the authoritarian
regime as an unjust contract. The revolt would be legitimate to achieve
a true equality between people. He tended to think that a democracy
would do less wars, and even less against noncombatants. Following him,
democracy would be the solution to move toward peace in Syria. However,
according to the size and the level of development of the country,
Rousseau recommended different behaviors. Small and agrarian countries
like Syria would build peace through isolationism and autarky, when the
large and develop countries should teach patriotism at school. [**All
these conceptions of realism** are however limited to understand the
contemporary civil wars. They tend to be too stato-centered to
completely differentiate the internal and external policies. They only
define the states as rational individuals and the national interest in
terms of power. Although the balance of power can be useful to think the
global order and hegemony\[13\], it is very limited in the case of war
occurring within the State, while it has concerned the majority of the
conflicts since the end of the Cold-War.]{.underline} Hans Morgenthau
defined power according to eight criteria (geography, natural resources,
industrial capacities, military preparation, population, national
character, national moral and quality of diplomacy)\[14\] whose
relevance is questionable. The indicators of stability proposed by
Michael Doyle to foresee the conflict considering realist variables
(army, distance) is of no help to understand the process of the Arab
springs. These theories remained very present until 2011, among
researchers, because a sociology of these Arab countries is very complex
in the civil war and authoritarian contexts[. The Arab Spring shook up
realistic theories about the Arab world. The "political games" of Graham
Allison showed the impossibility to keep **analyzing states as rational
units**\[]{.underline}15\]. Finally, Béatrice Hibou has also shown the
mechanisms used by the State to hold. More than coercion, they have used
mechanisms of privatization and "discharge" to build assents and
dependency links among the populations\[16\]. The constructivist
sociology of conflict has much to teach us.

#### ISIS aspiration at statehood explain ongoing violence.

International realism has many branches. Beginning with historical
thinkers such as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes, the realist
narrative has swept forward through time to practitioners such as
Richelieu, Bismarck, and Kissinger, and writers such as Morgenthau,
Waltz, and Mearsheimer. Analysts of realism have grouped contemporary
realists into different schools. These include classical realism,
traditional realism, neo-realism, neo-classical realism, structural
realism, liberal realism, left realism, offensive realism, defensive
realism and others (see e.g. Bew 2015; Elman and Jensen 2014). The
potential list of realisms seems limited only by the finitude of
adjectives. At the risk of contributing to further theoretical
overpopulation, we here present another variant: post-realism.
Post-realism begins by anchoring itself in the tenets of traditional
realism, and then adjusting them. It adapts historical realism to a
contemporary evolutionary path, appropriate for complex globalising
society. According to a standard realist narrative, [states are the
major actors in international relations. They are motivated mainly by
interests in maximising power. They extend their domestic monopolies of
violence onto anarchical international society through military actions
and war. Post-realism does not reject these elements but incorporates
them into a larger, more intricate story. Yes, states are substantial,
but there are other significant actors. Yes, interests and power matter,
but there are other motivations. Yes, military actions and war are
important, but there are other noteworthy forms of global
action.]{.underline} (cf. Legro and Moravcsik 1999; Beer and Hariman
1996, 2004). In any event, the essential realist narrative, as we
understand it, hardly reflects, or even guides, the actual practice of
most international relations scholars or the mechanics of actual
day-to-day governmental and non-governmental foreign policy operations
--- political, military, economic, social, cultural, or technological.
Here, professionals operate within their own regimes and disciplines,
epistemic communities and knowledge-based networks, private languages
and political bases. They have their own motivations and worlds of
meaning, exercising important policy influence very far from the direct
guidance of realist theory (cf. Cross 2013; Haas 1991). Instead of a
reduction to a few variables of states --- interests, capability to
project power, credibility, and the like --- post-realism directs
attention to those points where individual actors or the system as a
whole may appear less comprehensible or consistent through a traditional
realist lens. Post-realism aims to refocus realism with a higher
fidelity real-time picture: thicker description, more intricate
explanation, more nuanced prediction, and a better toolbox for
policy-makers trying to understand and navigate the multifaceted modern
world in which we live. Below, we illustrate post-realism's utility
using the example of ISIS. More than States Post-realism, like realism,
begins with states as actors. At the same time, it goes beyond states to
include a wide variety of non-state actors within the mix of players on
the world stage. These comprise various networks of governmental and
non-governmental actors combined in supra-national, national,
sub-national forms. [One set of such actors include militant groups such
as Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Hamas, Hezbollah, Shabab, the Taliban --- and
ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known by other names
including Daesh or ISIL]{.underline} (see Gerges 2016; Nance 2016, 20).
We focus specifically on this last group, to which we shall refer as
ISIS, which is a multidimensional, quasi-state/national actor. [It has
its own global, regional, and local networks with links to other
networks. It emphasises specific issues; it combines acts of violence
against enemies with social services to its clients. It has created a
distinctive presence in global media and discussions of foreign policy.
**ISIS aspires to be a state;** the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, the
Levant, and elsewhere. But it has much larger ambitions. The Caliphate,
if successful, would eventually expand to the ummah, the entire
community of the Islamic faithful. It harkens back to the past as it
points toward the future;]{.underline} it is thus pre-national and
post-national, pre-colonial and post-colonial, pre-realist and
post-realist. In this quest, ISIS aims at continuing the deconstruction
and reconstruction of the remains of the old empires. The most immediate
target includes the vestiges of the former Ottoman Sultanate. But ISIS
also aims to demolish the remains of the Sykes--Picot Agreement of 1916
between Britain and France, with the consent of Russia. This agreement,
together with the Balfour Declaration of 1917, from the United Kingdom's
Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Baron Rothschild, helped
establish the political framework ordering the Middle East. Ironically,
the successors to the old imperial European states have themselves
engaged in their own post-realist rebellion against the Westphalian
state system. They have simultaneously hoped to subsume themselves into
a larger European supra-national community, and to make all borders more
porous for flows of capital, labour, and information. [Tribal, national,
and post-national domains are thus parallel worlds for ISIS and other
actors where **post-realism is an emerging common sense.**]{.underline}

#### Actions line up corresponding to natural self-interest and a realist template.

Communication Studies at Northwestern University; 1-17-2018; \"Realism,

More than Interest and Power [Post-realism, like realism, suggests that
political actors are driven, if they are to survive, by national
self-interest defined primarily by considerations of power.
Post-realism, however, goes beyond self-interest and power to include
many other motivations, goals, and intentions implicit in economics,
society, and culture as well as multiple other frames --- metaphors and
narratives;]{.underline} [ideas, ideologies, and identities; mentalities
and cognitions; emotions and attitudes]{.underline} --- that surround
and give meaning to the actions of political leaders. It does so by
taking communication seriously: especially the discourses, images, and
public arts that constitute collective identity and public opinion.
These can be analysed not merely to identify self-interest and
perceptions of power and balance, but also to identify multiple other
drivers of political action (cf. Rice 2008). These extended --- but not
extrinsic --- [**elements** of consciousness **are evident in the
self-definition and scope of ISIS**. The organisation invests heavily
not only in military but also in media operations. It threatens others
not only by territorial conquest, but also through its persuasive reach
across continents to hundreds of millions of followers.]{.underline} It
is also an economic actor, supervising commercial activity in the
sectors that it controls, profiting from a range of industries from oil
to drugs, paying its civil servants and soldiers, though not always
well. [ISIS]{.underline} is finally a social, cultural, and theological
actor. It [aims at 'the restoration of an Islamic golden age and a
"glorious" new caliphate based on holy war' (]{.underline}Clarion
Project -- Harris, 2014). More than Military Actions Post-realism, like
[realism, includes military actions and war. In an **anarchic world,
violent capabilities** are unevenly distributed and there is no
universally accepted legitimate political order, no central authority,
no governmental monopoly of violence. Force remains a powerful
instrument of foreign policy, and ISIS certainly undertakes many
military actions that are consistent with the standard realist
narrative. Its massed attacks have seized and held territory such as
Mosul in Iraq and al-Raqqah in Syria, at least temporarily. Its suicide
bombers recall the Japanese kamikaze pilots of World War II. The Western
response to ISIS' use of force also has had a strong military component,
including advisors, special forces, drone strikes, conventional air and
missile bombardment, and military assistance to allied
groups.]{.underline} In domestic settings, standard and special police,
counterinsurgency, and intelligence units have conducted operations with
varying degrees of armed physical force (see, for example, Hayden 2016).
For post-realists, as for realists, [military action does not exist for
its own sake, but is necessarily embedded in a larger political
context.]{.underline} In the formulation of the Prussian strategist Carl
von Clausewitz (1984, 87), war is not 'a mere act of policy but a true
political instrument, a continuation of political activity by other
means.' Post-realism embraces a complex politics with a three-tiered
model of strategic analysis and political management. [First, l**eaders
must compete and cooperate** with other political actors to achieve
their aims. Second, they must also **maintain self-control**,
**managing** their own **political reputations** and identities before
many different audiences. Third, leaders must **juggle multiple
incommensurable political discourses** to balance and attain their
diverse objectives]{.underline} (Beer and Hariman 1996, 387-414).
Post-[realism includes more than military actions. Hard and soft power
coexist]{.underline} inside a wider envelope of smart power. The
leader's toolbox includes not only conflict but also cooperation, not
only physical but also verbal behaviour. Post-realism recognises the
need to adapt to the evolving political, economic, social, and
technological complexities of asymmetric interaction in physical and
media environments, and in cyberspace. A wide variety of modalities ---
military, political, diplomatic, economic, communicative, rhetorical,
and cultural --- are available for use. Diplomacy and Politics
[Post-realism follows realism in accepting the unavoidable existence of
carefully modulated and targeted military force in dealing with
ISIS.]{.underline} But, as Hans Morgenthau long ago emphasised,
diplomacy also remains essential in mobilising allies with common
interests and values in the Western and Arab worlds. Post-realism
follows this thread, but goes beyond it; to state diplomacy, it adds
public diplomacy. [Post-realism also asks how the fundamental
assumptions of military and political action may be changing. Military
action itself has increasingly become a form of politics.]{.underline}
As Simpson (2013, 1, 230, 243-4) suggests, war is increasingly a
military political hybrid. 'The use of armed force,' he says, 'seeks to
establish military conditions for a political solution.' At the same
time, armed force 'directly seeks political, as opposed to specifically
military, outcomes.' War is less compartmentalised than it used to be.
It is 'increasingly merging \[...\] with regular political activity.' As
'operational military ideas are invested with policy-like quality, we
are confronted with policy as an extension of war' rather than war as an
extension of policy. [War has become 'an interpretive structure, which
makes war "itself" a particular political instrument. War offers an
interpretive template which can be used \[...\] to persuade audiences to
understand conflict in a \[...\] "military" way.' Thus, post-realism
shifts from simple, reductive models of conflict to **understanding that
war and politics alike are structured** by conflicting category
interpretations]{.underline}.

#### Economic realism contributes to large parts of ISIS' actions.

**Beer et. al 18'** (FRANCIS A. BEER AND ROBERT HARIMAN; Professor
Emeritus of Political Science at University of Colorado and Professor of
Communication Studies at Northwestern University; 1-17-2018; \"Realism,
Post-Realism and ISIS\"; E-International Relations;
https://www.e-ir.info/2018/01/17/realism-post-realism-and-isis/;
accessed 7-20-2019; BF)

Economics [Post-realism's concern with more than military actions
certainly includes economic dimensions.]{.underline} In this, it follows
traditional realism's concern with the economic bases of power. In the
famous phrase from President Eisenhower's farewell address, the
military-industrial complex functions as a blended unit. Economic
capabilities seamlessly support military forces. In World War II, for
example, American production lines became the 'arsenal of democracy.'
[We have already referred to **ISIS' range of revenue generating
operations**. ISIS receives contributions from religiously oriented
actors. Further, ISIS is also a business conglomerate. Western military
operations --- for example, bombing oil facilities and supply lines
under ISIS control --- have aimed to degrade some of these
activities]{.underline}. Beyond this, however, economic sanctions and
embargoes have been an important tactical tool. [Western domination of
the global financial system has also restricted ISIS' capabilities. A
post-realist perspective also suggests the importance of economic
incentives in attracting ISIS recruits. Slow and uneven economic
development --- limited growth and economic inequality]{.underline} ---
in many parts of the Islamic and Western worlds has left behind a huge
mass of unemployed youth susceptible to jihadi appeals. Jihad is, among
other things, a jobs program. Like the Western military, it sucks up
unemployed youth, providing economic opportunity, group solidarity, and
a mission. Parts of the mission [evolve in lands directly under ISIS
control; other operations occur in third world or Western
territories]{.underline}. No Western strategy for dealing with ISIS can
possibly succeed over the long term without serious attention to
economic growth and employment --- particularly youth employment in
Islamic, developing, and Western worlds. Communication and Rhetoric
Post-realism, as a variant of realism, has a distinctive focus on
communication and rhetoric (cf. Pinkerton 2011; Der Derian 2009; Hanson
2008). [It strongly suggests that **realism is limited theoretically**
and strategically by inattention to discourse, not least its own
rhetorical habits.]{.underline} All global actors, including realists,
are also rhetorical actors engaged in constant communication with each
other. Military success will have limited value and duration unless the
many negotiations of cultural identity in the region are addressed, and
addressed while being well aware of the cultural and rhetorical problems
confronting any reassertion of Western norms. [Talk is not cheap. ISIS
is a rhetorical actor and a sophisticated user of social media. Its
messaging is highly structured, though subtly differentiated from other
groups like al-Qaeda. In a standard militant propaganda script, the
enemy is strong, numerous, homogeneous, evil and must be defeated. ISIS
suffers tremendously from the enemy in spite of the fact that its
leaders and members are virtuous, united, and pure. ISIS can hurt and
defeat the enemy by strict religious observance, unity, and violence
(]{.underline}see Cohen et al. 2016). ISIS also has its own rhetorical
sensitivities. Nance (2016, 428) suggests that 'there are some words
that they really hate.' In particular, they abhor the name Khawarij,
which is the name of 'the first Islamic cult group that the Prophet
Mohammed warned against.' And they have rhetorical weaknesses[: ISIS has
been less successful than some of its competitors in adapting to local
vernaculars and pushing a persuasive discourse to specific audiences.
Speaking of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,]{.underline} Elisabeth
Kendall (2015) suggests that: AQAP's staying power is explained, at
least in part, by its production of jihadist narratives that are
culturally attuned to their Yemeni context and adapted to prevailing
local conditions. ISIS, by contrast, has produced little narrative
\[...\] that is culturally specific to Yemen beyond savaging the
Houthis, tribesmen from Yemen's north who swept down through Yemen's
south in 2015. That said, ISIS also employs powerful rhetorical devices,
globally broadcasting its ideology and its actions to promulgate its
message and attract its followers.

#### Realist and Hobbesian philosophy account for the root cause of conflicts in the middle east

**Hinnebusch 15'** (Raymond; Professor at the School of International
Relations St Andrews United Kingdom; "The international politics of the
Middle East: Second edition";

The regional system: [conflict and order The character of the regional
order is the product of its original external imposition and the
collective interactions and conflicts of the states that contest or
defend it over time.]{.underline} That order, in turn, shapes the
character and behaviour of its parts, the states. [Roots of conflict
Conflict was literally built into the Middle East regional system, but
not simply because of the anarchy of a states system, as **neo-realism
holds**.]{.underline} Rather, it was [**the external imposition** of a
very flawed system that generated at least four durable sources of
conflict: **the struggle against imperialist control**, the
**frustration of identity** by the arbitrary **imposition of borders**,
the struggle over **Palestine** and the struggle over control of the
**region's oil.**]{.underline} The irredentism and [revisionism fostered
by these conflicts became pervasive in Middle Eastern societies and when
the power machineries of different states were captured by social forces
or identity groups on opposing sides of these issues, conflict was
institutionalised at the inter-state level.]{.underline} This took
exacerbated forms in the cases of settler states, with their built-in
expansionary impulses (Israel); artificial states, with their built-in
frustration (Iraq); and revolutionary states with their builtin ambition
to export their revolutions (Nasserist Egypt, Khomeini's Iran). Once, as
a result, war became a recurring feature of the regional system and
states were entangled in the security dilemma, wherein the attempt of
each to protect itself only made it a greater threat to its neighbours,
[a Hobbesian-like system was, indeed, 'constructed'. Such a system (its
insecurity, power imbalances) arguably becomes, itself, **a source of
war.** Today, there is not a single state that has not come to feel a
military threat from one or more of its neighbours.]{.underline}

## Warming Reps Good

### Warming Securitization Good 

#### **Climate change securitization is good -- it's an impact magnifier and the epistemology behind our evidence isn't state-centric meaning there is no threshold for a link.**

The first logic focuses on traditional security implications of climate
change such as its role as a threat multiplier and a source for violent
conflicts while the second logic focuses on human security implications
of climate change such as hunger, poverty, food insecurity and other
forms of human suffering. Although there are based on different logics,
these implications are interrelated. In most cases, [climate security
has direct implications for human security and these human security
implications result in traditional security issues]{.underline}. In this
study we divided the traditional and human security implications of
climate change for analytic clarity, but the interrelated security
consequences of climate change are also analyzed in the following part.
[Before looking at the discussion of different perspectives about the
securitization of climate change, the reasons of this securitization
should be stated]{.underline}. In the literature, two broad reasons for
the [securitization of climate change]{.underline} can be detected. The
first one [is "self-evident; **it is becoming increasingly clear that
future climate change threatens to exacerbate existing drivers of
conflict in a way that could roll back development across many
countries**]{.underline}."40 In addition to this reality, there is
[another reason]{.underline} that can be seen as pragmatic or political:
"[it is part of a clear process to invest the international debate with
greater sense of urgency]{.underline}."41 **[Climate
Change]{.underline}** is a Security Issue since it **[has Human Security
Implications]{.underline}** In 1994, the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) came up with the notion of human security. Human
security simply changed the focus of security from states to human
beings in order to alleviate their suffering stemming from existing
power asymmetries and processes.42 In line with this, the Commission on
Human Security (CHS) advanced the conceptualization of human security by
underscoring empowerment of human beings.43 From this wider
conceptualization, human security is defined as "moving away from
traditional, state-centric conceptions of security that focused
primarily on the safety of states from military aggression, to one that
concentrates on the security of the individuals, their protection and
empowerment."44 Therefore in human security the referent objects of
security are human beings. The possible [human security
threats]{.underline} are as follows: \[chart omitted\] The studies which
[approach climate change from the perspective of human security focus on
its consequences on the lives of individual human beings and their
well-being]{.underline}. Detraz and Betsill name this approach as
environmental security discourse.45 According to Nicole Detraz, the main
focus in the environmental security discourse is the human
vulnerabilities resulting from climate change. These include food
insecurity, health problems, and poverty.46 According to Joshi,
**[climate change helped us to realize that security should not be
understood as state-centric]{.underline}**. [The main referent object of
security has to be individuals and we need to re-conceptualize security
with regard to human security]{.underline}.47 Salami also argues that
[climate change is associated with human security related problems like
"food insecurity, increased poverty and reverse
development]{.underline}"48 Verbeke also argues that **[state-centric
security understanding is unsuitable for the context of climate change
and we need a broader concept of security]{.underline}**.49 According to
Denise Garcia, the human security implications of climate change are as
follows: [From a human security point of view, it is likely to aggravate
already precarious living conditions in low-lying countries and regions
struck by floods]{.underline}. [The public health
consequences]{.underline}, such as an increased risk of malaria and
other diseases, will [be noticeable, presenting an extra burden on poor
countries]{.underline}. Over a million children under age five die every
year from water-borne diseases. (...) [It can also affect other trends
that can diminish human security in the twenty-first century, such as
rising sea levels and migration]{.underline}, [internal population
displacement, loss of territory, crop failure, and many other unforeseen
but drastic weather events that may dramatically reduce human security
in many regions of the world]{.underline} (the second route of
securitization based on human security).50 The human security
implications of climate change are usually direct. For example, decrease
in the amount of rain-fed arable lands by climate change can directly
affect the well-being of people by leading food insecurity or rising of
sea level by the impact of [climate change can lead to]{.underline} the
replacement of many people especially in low lying coastal places. The
2007 UN Human Development Report outlined a number of risks that
threatened human development including: The [breakdown of agricultural
systems]{.underline}, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, leaving up to
600 million more people facing malnutrition; An additional 1.8 billion
people at risk from [water scarcity]{.underline} by 2080; Up to a third
of a billion people living in coastal regions [being displaced by
tropical storms and flooding]{.underline}; Hundreds of millions of
people [at increased risk from consolidating diseases]{.underline}, such
as malaria.51 [As the examples indicate, **the securitization of climate
change**]{.underline}, through the logic of human security **[focuses on
the security implications of climate change on the individual human
beings]{.underline}**. The next part analyzes the securitization of
climate change by the logic of the traditional security approach.
**[Climate Change]{.underline}** is a Security Issue since it has
Traditional Security Implications The traditional security approach,
which [**has Realist roots**, adopts a narrow definition of security in
which state is the main referent object and security agent]{.underline}
(provider of security), and security is achieved through the use of
force. Moreover, national independence, maintenance of territorial
integrity and sovereignty are the core values in this state-centric
understanding of the traditional security logic.52 Stephen Walt
describes security as "the study of the threat, use, and control of
military force."53 Additionally, Miller argues that "[threats to
national security are posed by other states; the nature of threats and
the way to deal with them require military responses]{.underline}."54
**[Scholars who tend to securitize climate change by the traditional
security logic focus on violent conflict and state
security]{.underline}**. Detraz and Betsill call [this logic of
securitization as environmental conflict discourse]{.underline}.[55
According to this logic, climate change can generate violent conflicts
or aggravate existing conflicts]{.underline}. **[The main focus in the
environmental conflict discourse is "the potential for violent conflict
over resources]{.underline}**."56 **[This understanding is based on the
idea that "when crops fail, people may take up a gun to make a
living]{.underline}**."57 In addition to violent conflicts,
[climate-induced scarcity may result in climateinduced destabilizing
migration and state instability]{.underline}.58 [Garcia also explains
this logic as follows: "**From a national security point of view, an
inability to pursue wealth will lead to instability and ultimately
failed states, which will in turn be breeding grounds for conflicts over
resources and large population movements**]{.underline}."59 Homer Dixon,
in his famous study titled "Environmental Scarcities and Violent
Conflict: Evidence from Cases," presents three areas in which
climate-induced scarcity generate security problems. In the first one,
scarcity simply leads to conflict between states. [Conflicts for water
or possible water wars between upstream and downstream states can be
given as an example for this area]{.underline}. In the second area[,
climate-induced scarcity causes migration, which in turn results in
identity-based conflict]{.underline}. In the final area [climate-induced
scarcity causes "economic deprivation, institutional disruption, and
civil strife." In this category climate change generates failed states,
civil war or insurgencies]{.underline}.60 **[It should be stressed that
there is no direct link between climate change and armed
conflict]{.underline}**. The link between climate change and conflict is
indirect or secondary: climate change generates scarcity (it is not the
only factor that generate scarcity) and scarcity generates conflict.
Moreover, in addition to climate-induced factors, there are also other
factors like political and ethnic tensions, which play a role in the
rise of a conflict. Brown et al. explains this indirect link as follows:
As the figure indicates, violent conflict itself has a feedback effect
for scarcity "since rival groups may increase their consumption of
resources to fund further conflict, and refugees fleeing areas of
violence may create new demands for resources elsewhere."61 In addition
to this main focus based on climate-induced scarcity and conflict, there
are other traditional security implications of climate change. The first
one is that **[climate change plays the role of threat
multiplier]{.underline}**. According to Delf Rothe, there is a consensus
among different actors of climate change that [climate change
plays]{.underline} (or can play) [the role]{.underline} of a threat
multiplier **[in which it "does not pose a security threat itself... but
it worsens a whole series of factors that are commonly associated with
conflicts]{.underline}**."62 Secondly, [the situation of low-lying small
islands also can be regarded within traditional security implications of
climate change]{.underline}. The [rise of sea levels]{.underline},
resulting from climate change, [threats the existence of these states
and **state survival is a traditional security issue**]{.underline}.
Climate-Induced Insecurities As expressed above, the human security
implications and traditional security implications of climate change are
mostly interrelated. In most cases climate change has primary human
security implications and secondary traditional security implications.
What's more, in the academic literature on the climate security, most
works analyze these implications together. This part will briefly
examine the security implications of climate change that are referred in
the literature on climate security. By that way, this part will present
the interrelated character of these security implications. [One of the
security implications of climate change is food insecurity]{.underline}.
According to Dupond and Pearman, there are several reasons of food
insecurity that are related to climate change. Firstly, [increasing
temperatures and unevenly distributed rainfall will result in
desertification and erosion in different areas]{.underline} and this
will diminish the arable lands. Secondly, [rising sea levels also will
make arable lands unusable]{.underline}. Finally, [extreme weather
events will drastically deteriorate the agriculture]{.underline}. **[All
of these impacts will result in food insecurity]{.underline}**. 63
Moreover, Brown and Crawford also argue that [diminishing arable lands
will result in reduction in agricultural production and this will lead
to food insecurity]{.underline}, [political instability]{.underline},
**[and conflicts on the control over arable lands]{.underline}**.64 In
addition to food insecurity, [climate change will generate water
scarcity]{.underline}. This also derives from uneven distribution of
rain because of climate change.65 Brown and Crawford argue that reduced
water supply is a climate-induced insecurity and it will lead to
increasing competition.66 Dupond and Pearman also argue that [both food
insecurity and water scarcity can also exacerbate existing tensions or
raise new ones]{.underline}, **[which may result in violent conflicts
for the control of resources]{.underline}**.67 Moreover, these
scarcities, with the help of "[temperature increases, extreme weather,
air pollution]{.underline}" [will lead to infectious
diseases]{.underline}.68 Another direct security implication of climate
change is emergence of weather related disasters because of warmer ocean
temperatures resulting from climate change.69 Low-lying coastal areas
and islands will also face severe insecurities including loss of whole
territory (or arable lands) because of rising sea levels.70 In addition
to this, fresh waters will get salted in these low-lying places because
of the rise of sea levels. As an indirect security implication, climate
change will also cause unregulated population movements deriving from
water scarcity, food insecurity, rising sea levels and devastating
natural disasters. These movements will lead to destabilization and
conflict within and between origin, transit and destination countries.71
[Other climate induced insecurities include disputes over ownership of
new energy resources in the arctic]{.underline}, passages to which will
be opened by rising temperatures; [increasing north-south tensions
related to the responsibilities and measures against climate
change]{.underline}; [increasing nuclear activity for eliminating the
use of fossil fuels.]{.underline} Moreover, [these]{.underline} impacts,
cumulatively, [will contribute to domestic political problems and
generate increasing number of failed states]{.underline}. 72 In addition
to these examples, climate security literature focuses also on the
climate related roots of contemporary conflicts. Two of the most
referred examples of these cases are the Darfur conflict and the
genocide in Rwanda.73 Even United Nations Secretary General Ban ki Moon
linked conflict in Darfur with climate change.74 More current than these
events, the emergence of ISIS and the conflict in Syria has also been
linked to the climate change. According to Kelley et al. [the
drought]{.underline} between 2007 and 2010 [in the Fertile
Crescent]{.underline} has [contributed to the emergence of "social
conflicts and ultimately the outbreak of war and the rise of the
'Islamic State']{.underline}."75

[show]{.underline} [that climate change poses a direct threat to the
basics of food, water, health and housing for hundreds of millions of
people around the world]{.underline}, but especially those living in
sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America. **[Developing
countries will bear an estimated 75% of the costs of climate
change]{.underline}**, the report noted, **[despite the poorest half of
the global population contributing just 10% of global carbon
emissions]{.underline}**. [Governments, corporations and even human
rights organizations]{.underline} (including the U.N.) [have been aware
of these climate-related threats for decades]{.underline}, Alston wrote,
**[but have failed to implement policies that could mitigate the likely
damage]{.underline}**. \"Somber [speeches by government officials have
not led to meaningful action]{.underline} and too many [countries
continue taking short-sighted steps in the wrong
direction]{.underline},\" Alston wrote. To illustrate this point, Alston
cited Brazil\'s President Jair Bolsonaro, who recently promised to allow
mining in the Amazon rainforest (one of the world\'s single largest
carbon offsets), and U.S. President Donald Trump, who \"presided over an
aggressive rollback of environmental regulations, and is actively
silencing and obfuscating climate science,\" the report said. While
policies like these move the world away from the U.N.\'s goal of
limiting global warming to 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius)
above preindustrial temperatures, Alston notes several [positive
developments]{.underline} in the climate fight, including lawsuits
against fossil fuel companies and the successful carbon emission
reductions in more than 7,000 cities around the world. Alston thinks
this positive pushback is just a start. To avert climate catastrophe,
this momentum [must be translated into the creation of a global
coalition of climate activists fighting for a \"deep social and economic
transformation,\"]{.underline} Alston wrote. **[To truly address the
threat of climate change, the world economy needs to \"decouple\" fossil
fuel production from massive profits, and instead focus on a shift to
policies that reward sustainability]{.underline}**. **[The task will not
be easy]{.underline}**, Alston wrote, **[but neither is it
impossible]{.underline}**. The first step, he said, is \"a reckoning
with the scale of the change that is needed.\" **[Radical changes in
policy]{.underline}**, **[and the immediate creation of a safety net to
help those individuals who will be most harmed by climate
change]{.underline}**, **[must follow]{.underline}**, he wrote.
**[Giving up on the challenge could not only doom millions to avoidable
death, but also shake the world\'s fundamental beliefs about what it
means to take care of one another]{.underline}**. **[Should the climate
be allowed to warm without restriction, \"human rights might not survive
the coming upheaval,\"]{.underline}** Alston wrote.

Major [studies]{.underline} have in the past few weeks [made it clearer
than ever that we are facing]{.underline}, in David Attenborough's words
at the opening of the summit last week, "[a manmade disaster of global
scale ... **our greatest threat in thousands of years**]{.underline}".
[First came a UN]{.underline} climate change special
[report]{.underline}, [which showed how we may have only 12 or so years
left]{.underline} [for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C,
beyond which the risks of floods, drought and extreme heat will
increase, and food shortages and poverty are likely for hundreds of
millions of people]{.underline}. [Then came a Global Carbon Budget
study]{.underline}, [which showed that]{.underline}, at current trends,
[the world is heading towards a catastrophic 3C of warming by
2100]{.underline}. **[To add gloom to the pessimism]{.underline}**, some
of the world's biggest investors issued a stark warning to governments
at the Katowice summit that failure to act urgently would result in
financial catastrophe. And the UN's World Meteorological Organization
has provisionally confirmed that the past four years have been the
hottest on record, and that **[extreme weather caused by manmade climate
change now affects all continents]{.underline}**. Taken together, these
reports show conclusively that [we are on the edge of climate
breakdown]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} that **[governments are
failing to prevent it]{.underline}**. **[Factor in the dramatic but
linked decline in biodiversity, and the potential for collapsed
ecosystems and mass extinctions, and we can see we are at an existential
crossroads, heading inexorably towards a fatally denuded
Earth]{.underline}**. Some leaders, such as the US president, Donald
Trump, and the incoming president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, say in
wilful ignorance that all this science is wrong and that nothing needs
to change -- indeed forests must be felled and fossil fuels be further
subsidised and promoted as "clean coal". Others, such as the Russian
president, Vladimir Putin, and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin
Salman, do not deny the science but coldly calculate how much they would
lose and try to water down commitments. In the middle at Katowice are
the 10,000 government negotiators and NGOs trying to make rich countries
reduce emissions and help poor countries adapt to inevitable climate
change. But these UN climate talks depend on the consensus of all
countries, so the progress appears incremental, even glacial. And
because they do not involve adversarial politicians, they are considered
unimportant by most of the world's media. Beyond Katowice, though, are
many millions of people who expect their leaders to act in the interests
of all, and who are increasingly dismayed that the global economic
system threatens everyone's future. We are now in a race against time to
address climate change. We have started late, the signs are not good,
and the gap between high-level rhetoric and action to reduce emissions
is widening. Fury is now building against governments, with the
Extinction Rebellion climate protest group taking non-violent direct
action, which has spread to 35 countries in just a few weeks. There are,
however, lots of reasons to believe we can meet the challenge. This
year, Trump's decision to pull the world's second-biggest carbon emitter
out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions has backfired. Not only did
US emissions fall in 2018, many US states, cities and businesses said
they intended to fulfil their Paris obligations. The transition to a
less carbon-intensive energy system is also gathering pace. The share of
renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by at
least one-fifth in the next five years . By 2020 it should be cheaper to
build new renewable energy plants in most countries than to keep coal or
fossil fuels burning. Countries can already save money by retiring coal
plants and substituting wind and solar. Soon only subsidies worth around
£5tn a year will keep coal alive in many countries. Even more
optimistically, the world's largest developing countries are now in the
forefront of the transition to lower emissions. India and China, with
nearly a third of the world's people, are at the forefront of the next
solar revolution and, like Europe, are firmly on the path to
decarbonisation. **[An unseen revolution is taking place in the way we
power the world]{.underline}**. **[From denial and inaction just two
decades ago, countries now dare to think big]{.underline}**. [China is
to build a giant solar park in the Gobi desert big enough to power 1
million homes]{.underline}; [a single project in India will be even
larger]{.underline}, covering 10,000 acres of Rajasthan, and one in the
desert near Aswan in Egypt should deliver as much power as two nuclear
power stations. [The world is full now of major
initiatives]{.underline}. Spurred by the commitments made at the Paris
climate meeting in 2015, [many countries]{.underline}, for example, [are
furiously planting trees]{.underline}; carbon capture and storage to
take the emissions of fossil fuels is becoming a reality; millions of
rice farmers have adopted the system of rice intensification which
halves the water needed and reduces methane emissions from rice
cultivation by up to 50%. These and many others are, so far, only
incremental initiatives, coming far too slowly to even brake the
warming. **[These are the seeds of change]{.underline}**, [lifting
ambition, inspiring hope and showing the potential for change on a
planetary scale]{.underline}. **[They also help politicians and bankers
understand that getting to net zero emissions in just 40 years is
technically and financially possible, and the best investment any
country can ever make]{.underline}**. By the end of the week, Britain
may have weathered another political storm and people may be able to see
a little clearer what is happening. Perhaps then our politicians will
lift their heads and turn to address the greatest challenge any
generation is ever likely to face. **[They will see that people are up
for the challenge. If they then don't respond with urgency, we are not
just metaphorically in the soup, we may literally be
cooked]{.underline}**.

#### Specific, individual and small steps towards solving the warming crisis are critical to solving warming.

**Simon 7/17/2019** (Matt Simon, staff science writer at WIRED, "CLIMATE
CHANGE IS VERY REAL. BUT SO MUCH OF IT IS UNCERTAIN",
https://www.wired.com/story/climate-change-is-very-real-but-so-much-of-it-is-uncertain/)micahw

ONE OF THE more terrifying elements of [climate change]{.underline} is
the uncertainty of it all. You start with the big picture of a warming
planet, but as you zoom in you find ever more climatic and geological
and biological systems interacting with one another---a complexity
unfathomable for the human mind. We're talking about a crisis that [is
affecting every organism and every square inch of this
planet]{.underline}. That makes calculating the carbon budget---the
amount of greenhouse gases humanity can emit globally while adhering to
certain goals---an unenviable task. (The goal of the Paris Agreement was
1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels; we're already at 1
degree.) Different teams of researchers have reached wildly diverging
conclusions, from "We can emit 1,000 gigatonnes more CO2 before we reach
1.5 degrees" to "Sorry, but we've already spent our carbon budget for
1.5." There is simply too much uncertainty in the models. But today in
the journal Nature, [researchers are proposing a new framework that aims
to bring clarity to this kind of work]{.underline}, [first by
reconciling differences in carbon budgets and second by reducing
uncertainty going forward]{.underline}. **[That's critical, because
climate policy hinges on the budget, and it's climate policy that'll
help us stave off global disaster]{.underline}**. For the past few
years, the main challenge with formulating a carbon budget has been
definitional. Do you, for instance, only incorporate global air
temperatures, or should ocean temperatures be part of the mix too? Also,
what greenhouses gases are we even talking about here? The two main
warming culprits, CO2 and methane, are very different beasts: Methane is
a far more powerful greenhouse gas, but it dissipates much faster in the
atmosphere, so is CO2 ultimately of greater concern? And as the models
improve, they grow ever more complex by incorporating ever more
planetary factors---what scientists call "unrepresented Earth system
feedback mechanisms." In the polar regions, for instance, permafrost is
thawing. When this happens, microbes convert carbon stored in the soil
into CO2 and methane, leading to further warming. If you're not pitying
climate scientists yet, consider just a handful more complicating
factors: Melting ice exposes dark land underneath, which absorbs more of
the sun's energy than white snow; plastics might be killing the bacteria
that are responsible for 20 percent of carbon capture on Earth;
deforestation removes trees that suck CO2 out of the air. [What the
Nature researchers have done is reconcile the thinking behind various
approaches to the carbon budget]{.underline}. Their holistic calculation
includes multiple types of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane
from thawing permafrost, and incorporates the most up-to-date estimates
of current warming. "It lifts the fog a bit on confusion that was there
before," says lead author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial
College London. Previously, lots of different carbon budget studies used
lots of different methods. "But when it comes to calculating the size of
the future carbon budget, the estimates from different methods don't all
agree," says Phil Goodwin, who studies Earth system dynamics at the
University of Southampton and wasn't involved in this work. "This study
does a really good job of explaining the possible reasons why different
studies have arrived at different estimates of the future carbon
budget." The research also provides a more unified framework to compare
different methodologies and their carbon budget estimates. And it spits
out its own carbon budget, too. Previous estimates have fallen along a
spectrum, with some suggesting that the 1.5-degree target is already out
of the reach and others assuring us we have 20 years to transition to a
low-carbon economy. The good news: The Nature team's carbon budget sits
pretty much in the middle of those extremes. Still, [why not just say,
Hey, let's all cut emissions as quickly as we can?]{.underline} The
problem with that, says Concordia University climate scientist Damon
Matthews, "is that '[as quickly as possible' means many, many different
things to different people]{.underline}." Matthews, who was not involved
in the Nature study, added that "**[we haven't even started to talk
about what might be 'possible' and are still mostly arguing about what
is 'feasible without compromising economic growth.]{.underline}**' These
are of course extremely different things, and the latter will not get us
anywhere near the 1.5 degrees C target." Piers Forster, director of the
Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds
and a coauthor on the new paper, agrees with Matthews. "**[You can\'t
just tell every country to cut emissions to zero as fast as
possible]{.underline}**," he says. When the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change was negotiating its most recent report, Forster adds,
"[we actually spent over 24 hours negotiating the paragraph on the
carbon budget, and that\'s because it\'s a really contentious
thing]{.underline}." **[This new framework may well help guide future
negotiations. And so researchers continue to chip away at the inherent
uncertainties of climate change, one complicated Earth system at a
time.]{.underline}**

### NoKo Aggression Real 

#### US approaches to constrain North Korea operate under the assumption of NoKo aggression

strategic choices and the North Korean threat,\" Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/research/endgame-a-reflection-on-u-s-strategic-choices-and-the-north-korean-threat/

This paper was presented at the 6th Brookings-Korea Research Institute
for National Strategy (KRINS) joint conference, "Strategy of the Kim
Regime and the ROK-U.S. Response in the Era of North Korea's Nuclear
Upgrades," in Seoul on January 17, 2018. [We may be moving closer to a
military conflict on the Korean Peninsula -- a conflict that could have
a nuclear dimension. As 2018 begins, the signs are ominous. Kim Jong
Un's New Year's speech marked the opening of a North Korean campaign to
gain acceptance for its status as a nuclear weapons power. Seoul's quick
and positive response to his overtures stood in sharp contrast to
Washington's strong negative reaction]{.underline}. The U.S. continues
to demand North Korean denuclearization, and has declared a
nuclear-armed North Korea "intolerable" and "unacceptable[." On its
part, Pyongyang has vowed never to give up its nuclear weapons and has
called for the United States to recognize the "reality" of a
nuclear-armed DPRK. The U.S. and the DPRK could be on a collision
course.]{.underline} Washington is hinting that military action may be
needed to prevent North Korea's acquisition of the capability to
threaten the United States with nuclear weapons. [The DPRK may believe
the U.S. is bluffing, and has promised to strengthen further its nuclear
deterrent and its ability to attack the United States. Washington's
flirtation with a "military option" is fueled by concern that North
Korea will soon be able to threaten the U.S. homeland with nuclear
weapons, and by the belief that the classic tools of U.S. security
strategy, including deterrence, are of no use against an "irrational"
North Korea. With tensions rising and the possibility of confrontation
looming, these and other assumptions need to be reexamined and tested to
avoid miscalculation]{.underline}. As the North Korea crisis moves to a
new and dangerous level, the time is ripe for a serious reassessment of
the military option, its dangers, and its potential to undermine
America's Northeast Asian alliances. Indeed, the moment could not be
better for a serious review of all three major remaining options and
their consequences, and for frank consultations with allies and
partners, as well as straight talk with the American people and allies
about U.S. intentions. This review must include answering the most
important question of all: How does this end?

Seoul, South Korea \-- [The North Korean regime has suggested it is

missile tests and other steps aimed at improving ties with the U.S. A
statement by the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday appeared aimed at applying
more pressure on the U.S. as the two countries attempt to resume nuclear
diplomacy]{.underline}. [The statement said upcoming regular U.S.-South
Korean military drills that [North

an invasion rehearsal were forcing it to rethink whether it should
remain committed to the promises it made to the U.S.]{.underline} The
North said President Trump had vowed to suspend military drills with
South Korea during his first and third meetings with North Korean leader
Kim Jong Un. The Foreign Ministry statement called a U.S. decision to go
ahead with the war games would be \"clearly a violation of the basic
spirit\" of the agreement between the two countries, and thus North
Korea\'s impetus to adhere to its own pledges was \"gradually
disappearing.\" Trump confronts nuclear threats from Iran and North
Korea The statement also said Pyongyang was not bound by any legal
documents to suspend nuclear and missile tests. [Despite an historic and
controversial visit paid by President Trump to North Korean territory
early this month, during which he [met Kim for about 45
minutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-meeting-dmz-sunday-2019-06-30/),
there has been scant indication of any real headway in the diplomatic
standoff between the two nations. Mr. Trump told reporters he and Kim
had agreed to restart negotiations on a deal to pave the way for the
complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula]{.underline}. The
president, who hailed his \"great relationship\" with the North Korean
strongman, invited Kim to the White House to continue their talks. Trump
makes history with visit to North Korea Thousands of U.S. forces have
remained in South Korea, mostly along the heavily fortified border with
the North, since open warfare ceased in the Korean War 1953. There still
has not been a treaty to officially end that war. Mr. Trump said shortly
before he met Kim that it was too soon to know whether he might hold a
third formal summit with Kim following an [unsuccessful meeting earlier

stories give us a glimpse into what that universe will look like, and
the problems we are going to face navigating within it. One, obviously,
is the Great Sony Hack Episode --]{.underline} and I'll get to that in a
minute. The other, which has gotten less attention \[though Jon Adler
did have [a pointer to it here on the
VC](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/12/24/north-korea-loses-in-d-c-circuit/)
last week\], is the DC Circuit's decision to enter a default judgment
against the government of North Korea in [Kim v Democratic Republic of
North
Korea.](http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DB1402FAB536627C85257DB70054D644/%24file/13-7147-1528848.pdf)
Though the two episodes are entirely unrelated (except for the identity
of the alleged wrongdoer in both cases), they make an interesting linked
pair. First, the Kim case. Reverend Dong Shik Kim is (or was -- it is
not clear whether he is still alive) a South Korean citizen, and a
permanent resident of the U.S. He was living for many years in
northeastern China, and was a well-known and vocal opponent of the North
Korean regime. From his base in China, he "provided humanitarian and
religious services to North Korean defectors and refugees who fled to
China seeking asylum." In 2000, he was abducted and taken to North Korea
for interrogation and imprisonment. Several of Kim's relatives sued the
government of North Korea in federal court, asserting (a) that the
government of North Korea was responsible for Kim's abduction, (b) that
Kim was tortured during interrogation and killed while in custody in a
North Korean prison. That they can bring this claim at all -- suing a
foreign government, in federal court, seeking a damage award against it
for conduct undertaken by that foreign government wholly outside the
borders of the United States -- is itself a noteworthy feature of the
new legal landscape. Ordinarily, foreign governments are immune from
suit -- "sovereign immunity" -- in US courtrooms; in US law, this is
embodied in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA -- 28 USC 1604),
which strips the federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain claims
against foreign States. That general rule is subject, though, to
exceptions, one of which is the recently-enacted "terrorism exception"
in 28 USC 1605A. That gives the courts jurisdiction in cases ". . . in
which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal
injury or death that was caused by an act of torture \[or\]
extrajudicial killing \[as defined elsewhere, in the Torture Victims
Protection Act\] . . . if such act . . . is engaged in by an official,
employee, or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope
of his or her office, employment, or agency." And not only does it give
the federal courts jurisdiction to hear such claims, it sets out a new
cause of action: if the foreign government in question has been
designated a "state sponsor of terrorism," US nationals (or members of
the US armed forces, or US government employees) may seek and obtain
damages for personal injury or death caused by such "acts of torture" or
"extrajudicial killings." It's a rather extraordinary little piece of
the US Code. The immunity of fellow-sovereigns from legal claims arising
out of their conduct is a pretty venerable concept -- indeed, it may be
implicit in the very notion of "sovereignty" itself. The US government
often objects to the notion that its actions (as sovereign) can be
subject to examination and punishment in a foreign forum -- and yet that
is what the "terrorism exception" is all about (at least as regards this
narrow slice of sovereign conduct that we deem to be particularly
heinous). So Reverend Kim's US relatives bring suit under this
provision. The government of North Korea does not respond to the suit,
so the Kims ask the district court for the entry of a default judgment
against it. \[Note to law students: if you're looking for a paper topic,
how about: Can a foreign government assert that the entry of a judgment
against it under the FSIA is unconstitutional on the grounds that the
court lacks personal jurisdiction over it?\] The statute, anticipating
that this might happen (i.e., that governments designated as state
sponsors of terrorism will not show up to defend themselves in a US
courtroom), includes a special provision regarding the entry of default
judgments: No judgment by default shall be entered . . . unless the
claimant establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence
satisfactory to the court." 28 U.S.C. § 1608(e). It's a kind of special
privilege accorded to the foreign government, a sign of
sovereign-to-sovereign respect; even though the foreign
government-defendant hasn't even shown up, the court will not enter a
default judgment against it (as it would, in the ordinary case of a
defaulting defendant) without undertaking an examination of the evidence
that plaintiff has to back up his claim, and satisfying itself that the
plaintiffs' evidence is sufficient to back up their allegations and to
satisfy their "burden of production." The Kims' problem is that they
don't have a great deal of evidence to back up their allegations -- a
classic Catch-22, of course, because, as the court put it, it is "the
defendant State itself \[that\] prevents any evidence from leaving its
borders." They don't "know" exactly what happened to Rev. Kim in North
Korea, or even whether he is dead or alive; their evidence consists
largely of persons "who claim to have heard second- or third-hand that
the Reverend died as a result of torture soon after he disappeared. But
no one---not the Kims, not the witnesses who submitted declarations on
their behalf, and not the district court---knows for certain what
happened." The district court -- not unreasonably -- declared that this
was not enough; how can we enter a judgment against a foreign State for
torturing and killing Rev. Kim when nobody can establish whether he was
ever actually tortured or killed? The appeals court -- also, not
unreasonably -- reversed. '\[P\]laintiffs like the Kims will find it
difficult to prove what happened behind the walls of a North Korean
labor camp because the government has made all but certain that that
evidence does not exist. But the Kims did have evidence, first, that the
North Korean government itself abducted Rev. Kim -- "compelling,
admissible evidence" in the form of a South Korean criminal proceeding,
in which a North Korean government agent was found guilty of the
abduction. They also had evidence (in the form of expert testimony and
individual declarations) that the North Korean government "routinely
tortures and kills the people it abducts." This, the court declared, was
sufficient -- at least for purposes of evaluating whether plaintiffs
have satisfied their burden of production -- to show that "the defendant
probably tortured and killed the victim." That South Korean criminal
case turned out to be critical to the court's reasoning: Our conclusion
would no doubt differ if we lacked confirmed evidence that the DPRK was
involved in Reverend Kim's disappearance. In that case, finding that the
regime tortured and killed him would arguably require too many logical
leaps. But that is not this case. Here, the Kims' evidence that the
regime abducted the Reverend, that it invariably tortures and kills
prisoners like him, and that it uses terror and intimidation to prevent
witnesses from testifying allows us to reach the logical conclusion that
the regime tortured and killed the Reverend. In other words, the Kims'
evidence is "satisfactory to the court." [Epistemologically, at least,
this strikes me as a pretty close question. Knowing that North Korea
abducted Rev. Kim, and that it "routinely tortures and kills the people
it abducts," certainly makes it more likely that Kim himself was
tortured and killed. But in ordinary conversation, I'm not sure I would
be comfortable saying that we "know," from these facts, what happened in
this specific instance, to Rev. Kim. But it is, after all, only a
default judgment -- and the "knowledge" standard is lower than it
otherwise might be in a different context: If the DPRK is unhappy with
that outcome and has evidence that it has not tortured and killed
Reverend Kim, it, like any defendant in default, may ask the district
court to vacate that judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
60(b). The same question -- what happened,, and how do we know what
happened?]{.underline} -- is, it seems to me, a fundamental part of the
Sony Hack discussion as well. Was it, as claimed, an action directed by
the North Korean government, or not? That matters, and it matters a
great deal. If a group of, say, rogue Sony employees was behind the
hack, that is still a serious matter (for Sony) but it presents a very
different question of public policy. There's a strong public interest,
to be sure, in protecting private corporate property from damage; but a
break-in at Sony headquarters by a band of rogue employees involves a
very different interest than a break-in at Sony headquarters by a band
of North Korean agents. This, of course, is what many people refer to as
the "attribution problem" -- how can we know who did what on the Net?
How certain can we be that specific messages, or destructive code,
originated in a specific place? What kinds of evidence increases, or
decreases, our uncertainty about that? These questions, too, are going
to be a prominent feature of the new landscape. The US government thus
far has said: we are convinced, on the basis of the data we have, that
the North Korean government is responsible. Here's [the FBI
statement](http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation):
As a result of our investigation, and in close collaboration with other
U.S. government departments and agencies, the FBI now has enough
information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible
for these actions. While the need to protect sensitive sources and
methods precludes us from sharing all of this information, our
conclusion is based, in part, on the following: Technical analysis of
the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other
malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed. For
example, there were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption
algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks. The FBI
also observed significant overlap between the infrastructure used in
this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has
previously linked directly to North Korea. For example, the FBI
discovered that several Internet protocol (IP) addresses associated with
known North Korean infrastructure communicated with IP addresses that
were hardcoded into the data deletion malware used in this attack.
Separately, the tools used in the SPE attack have similarities to a
cyber attack in March of last year against South Korean banks and media
outlets, which was carried out by North Korea. We [are deeply concerned
about the destructive nature of this attack on a private sector entity
and the ordinary citizens who worked there. . . . \[T\]he destructive
nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart.
North Korea's actions were intended to inflict significant harm on a
U.S. business and suppress the right of American citizens to express
themselves. Such acts of intimidation fall outside the bounds of
acceptable state behavior. The FBI takes seriously any attempt---whether
through cyber-enabled means, threats of violence, or otherwise---to
undermine the economic and social prosperity of our citizens. That's not
good enough -- just knowing that the FBI is convinced does not convince
me, and until they've released enough of the data so that people who
know more about this sort of thing than I do outside of and independent
of the government can look it over and give us all a sense of just how
strong it is, I don't think I will be convinced. But does it even matter
whether or not "we" are convinced? Well, the US government has -- again,
"apparently" -- taken retaliatory action against North Korea, in the
form of temporarily disabling the IP Address blocks assigned to the
North Koreans. That's a rather serious matter -- whether or not it is
technically an "act of war" under international law (which turns out to
be a knotty and difficult question), it's a serious interference with
another State's internal infrastructure, and I would think that before
my government undertook such a step it would let us all know the basis
upon which it is acting -- not just declaring that it has a basis for
acting, but explaining what it is. But wait -- maybe this all just
"espionage" and "counter-espionage"? The sort of thing that "goes on all
the time," necessarily out of public view? And how can we tell, these
days?]{.underline}

#### The most accurate and effective lens of viewing North Korea is through one of realism

Hee Jae **Shim**, 04-24-20**18**, \"The Dilemma of the North Korean
Nuclear Issue - Denuclearization or Coexistence,\"
https://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1728&amp;context=oa_theses

E. H. Carr argues that "there is no authority above the state capable of
imposing moral behavior on it."8 [The reality of international politics
is anarchy. Kenneth Waltz contends that in this anarchic reality a state
must take self-help measures to ensure its security by all means because
its security cannot be guaranteed by any other state.9 In other words,
individual sovereign states will increase their security assurance
capability through enhancing military forces and establish diplomatic
relations with other states to effectively deter external threats, and
to create a favorable external security environment. The realist view
provides the most intuitive understanding of the North Korean nuclear
issue.]{.underline} The basis of conflict on the Korean peninsula is the
confrontation between South Korea and North Korea, which has continued
since the Korean War in 1950. South Korea and North Korea have
threatened the survival of each other for more than 60 years. Each has
strengthened its military capabilities and maintained alliances with
powerful states, the US for South Korea and China for North Korea, to
secure its survival. In this context, it is a basic framework of the
North Korean nuclear issue that North Korea attempts to overcome the
tremendous difference in conventional forces with the US-South Korea
alliance by possessing nuclear weapons in order to secure its survival[.
However, if we consider the discussion so far to be a viewpoint of
defensive realism, another framework of analysis is needed to understand
the North Korean nuclear issue. If we look at the North Korean nuclear
issue only in the relationship between South Korea and North Korea, the
view of defensive realism is effective]{.underline}. However,
considering the US, which supports South Korea, and China, which
supports North Korea, a different view is needed. For the US and China,
the North Korean nuclear issue has not been a vital issue that threatens
their survival. John J. Mearsheimer, an aggressive realist, argues that
once a superpower becomes a hegemon in its region, it acts as an
offshore balancer to maintain balance of power in other regions.10 It is
the relic of the Cold War era that the United States is actively
intervening in the conflict situation on the Korean peninsula by keeping
US troops stationed in South Korea, but also the US wants to check China
that is growing rapidly. China strategically intends to defend North
Korea, which acts as a buffer between China and the US and also wants to
check the US in order to ensure its position of regional supremacy.

#### North Korea is offensive realist and poses a greater danger

Admiral Sandy **Winnefeld,** 7-20-20**19**, \"Realism and North Korea,\"
Cipher Brief,
https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/best-of-realism-and-north-korea

Every recent U.S. administration (Clinton, Bush, and Obama) has
confronted the problem of North Korea's (DPRK) nuclear weapons program.
While claiming their predecessors failed, successive administrations
have shared the same objective: completely roll back the DPRK's
development of a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and prevent
proliferation of a nuclear weapon or device to a third party -- both
without inducing a conflagration on or outside the Peninsula. After
working the problem, all three administrations came to the same
conclusion: [North Korea's strategic weapons program is a complex and
difficult issue with no simple solution. The Trump Administration
appears to be headed in the same direction. Some combination of the same
options has always been in play: negotiations, sanctions, the threat of
force, and pressure on China to use its influence with the North. None
of these tactics have worked. So why have we failed? The answer is
clear: A succession of paranoid and isolated regimes in the North,
incorrectly believing the U.S. intends to overthrow them, have seen
deliverable nuclear weapons as their principal deterrent to such
action.]{.underline} They have decided that bearing the costs of
possessing such weapons is well worth their efficacy in ensuring regime
survival. Moreover, North Korea has no interest in negotiating a
comprehensive deal with the U.S. because the regime needs the U.S. as an
enemy---the elimination of an external distraction and the increased
information flow accompanying a rapprochement could very well spell the
beginning of the end of the regime. So what should we do? We need to
change the fundamental objective of our policy, because North Korea will
never willingly give up its program. Washington's belief that this was
possible was a key mistake in our initial policy thinking. The U.S.
objective needs to shift from denuclearization to deterring the North
from ever using or proliferating its nuclear weapons. With this as the
objective, the first step is to understand what not to do. Most
important, do not threaten to use force to destroy the regime. It is
hubris to think that we could somehow control either a covert or overt
process of regime change in North Korea or that China would cooperate in
such a move. Given North Korea's purpose for having nuclear weapons in
the first place and because the leadership is rational, it stands to
reason that the only thing that would cause them to actually use nuclear
weapons would be a direct and imminent threat to their survival. This,
in turn, means making it clear we have no interest in regime change or
in the forceful reunification of the Peninsula, while still being fully
committed to defending South Korea. Also, it means in no way
capitulating to North Korea provocations by buying them off in some way
-- providing food, fuel, or any of their other demands. So, what does
this mean for policy? It begins with continuing to explicitly not
recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapons state. It continues with an
unstated "stew-in-your-own-juice-but-don't-dare-use-or-proliferate"
policy backed by the pillars of deterrence: denying the objectives of,
and imposing costs on, use or proliferation. This combination forecloses
potential acceptance to other nuclear aspirants, and it states the costs
of such ambition. The only tragedy in this approach is a human one,
namely the millions of North Koreans who will continue to live under
oppressive conditions. But that tragedy is the responsibility of the
North Korean leadership, not ours. There are five key pieces to this
policy approach. First, South Korea (ROK) is our ally, and we are
rightfully pledged to its defense, which requires maintaining a high
state of readiness. We should not scale back our existing readiness
exercises, though they should be conducted in a way that makes it clear
to the DPRK that they are only exercises and that they are defensive,
not offensive. Moreover, we should bolster our conventional defenses,
principally through more prepositioned equipment that the Army can
rapidly fall in upon in the event of a crisis (it is not politically
feasible to move troops out of U.S. congressional districts to Korea,
nor is it economical to permanently station additional troops in the
ROK). This would have two salutary effects. First, it would make it far
more likely that South Korea could be defended should a provocation
escalate into a conventional war. Second, it would constitute a new rung
on the escalation ladder---one that does not pose an immediate threat to
North Korea but that could be quickly generated if necessary, thus
helping to avoid the North's potential use of nuclear weapons. Second,
the North Korean regime needs to continue to pay the price for its
nuclear weapons program, if only to deter other nuclear aspirants such
as Iran. This implies continued sanctions with the potential for
escalating them. While far more are available, they need to be carefully
calibrated to ensure that each instance of sanctions bites but also
leaves more in the kit for future needs. Nor can our sanctions be so
strangling that the North concludes they are the key element of a policy
of regime change. More useful than economic sanctions against
individuals is pressure that greatly complicates North Korea's ability
to do business in the world. This could include a UN Security Council
resolution authorizing inspection of all goods transiting to and from
North Korea, including on the global commons, along with an enforcement
mechanism, none of which current resolutions permit, but that we might
obtain through skillful diplomacy and careful timing. This will throw
sand in North Korea's economic machinery, check their acquisition of
goods that support nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and more
importantly, make it more difficult for them to export finished weapons
technology. Here, solidarity, credibility, and political influence
within the UN are critically important. But of course every effort on
this front has traditionally been met with resistance from China.
Thus---and third---we should maintain pressure on China, but we should
also understand they are on the horns of a dilemma. The only thing China
dislikes---indeed, fears---more than a nuclear armed North Korea is a
destabilized nuclear-armed North Korea. The reasons are obvious: China
wants neither a massive stream of refugees nor a U.S. or ROK military
force on their border. And they certainly don't want the DPRK coercively
threatening to use nuclear weapons against the ROK or "loose nukes" in a
collapsing North Korea that could find their way into the wrong hands.
We want to avoid these things as well. As a result, China is only
willing to apply pressure on the DPRK regime to a point well short of
destabilization, which is not enough to induce the latter to give up its
program (in fact, it is possible that no amount of Chinese pressure will
get the North to give up its program). And, in any case, China will
apply pressure only under constant diplomatic, economic, and military
pressure from others. The first two types are straight forward, but what
do we mean by military pressure? Simple: it makes China very uneasy when
the U.S. takes actions required to defend against North Korea's
improving capability when China perceives that those actions impact its
own freedom of action in the region. A good example is U.S. deployment
of a THAAD battery to Guam in the wake of DPRK commencement of medium
range ballistic missile testing. China hates this because it wants to be
able to threaten Guam in the event of a conflict with the U.S. Recent
moves towards placing THAAD on the Korean Peninsula have dramatically
escalated this concern for China (even though they refuse to understand
that THAAD is not a threat to China). So be it. Fourth, this approach
would change the purpose and character of any future discussions with
the DPRK. A "stew-in-your-juice" policy implies that we will not get
involved in negotiations regarding the nuclear program since we know
that the North would not be serious players in such talks. If some kind
of talks do occur---presumably over other topics, or even in the
unlikely event they do decide to seriously negotiate on the nuclear
issue---we must do a better job negotiating than we have in the past. We
should continue to insist that any negotiations with the regime be in
some way multilateral in order to maintain solidarity with our allies
and partners and to prevent the DPRK from dividing us. Any negotiations
must be patiently and firmly conducted, not rushed to meet some
artificial political timeline. And they must be conducted from a
position of principled strength. Past negotiations have generally been
asymmetric, in which North Korea is offered something irreversible (such
as money, fuel, or food) in return for something reversible (such as
restraints on further development of some sort of nuclear capability),
only to go back on their word once the irreversible is pocketed and they
want more. Fifth, and finally, we have to strengthen the two pillars of
deterrence. "Denying objectives" includes solidifying our defense
against a DPRK ballistic missile threat. This means both "left of
launch" and "right of launch" capabilities. There are any number of
possible avenues for the former, which are not appropriate to discuss in
this forum. But selectively and periodically acknowledging such efforts
will inject additional uncertainty into Kim Jong-un's calculus. Right of
launch means continuing to advance regional and national ballistic
missile defense capability against this limited,
low-probability-but-high-consequences threat. Moscow and Beijing do not
like these deployments, because they believe, incorrectly, that the
defenses are aimed at them. The Russians and Chinese are just going to
have to understand our need for these limited defenses against the DPRK,
and we have to accept that Russia and China will take the steps they
consider necessary in order to assure the survivability of their nuclear
deterrent. More missile defense systems are only part of the answer;
system improvements, such as better detection and engagement capability,
provide huge leverage. Turning a phrase on its ear, quality has a
quantity all its own in this area: technical improvements decrease the
number of missiles we must launch against each threat, thereby
immediately increasing our own capacity. To fortify the "impose costs"
deterrence pillar, the regime should be reminded from time to time, both
publicly and privately, of our ability to execute a prompt nuclear
response if necessary. To make this explicit, we must declare to North
Korea: "we can and will defeat any attack you conduct on the U.S. or our
allies, and if you do attack with nuclear weapons, we will respond with
overwhelming force in whatever way is required to eliminate the imminent
threat." It is implicit that the North Korean leadership is part of that
threat. We must make a similar declaratory statement---hopefully in
cooperation with China and the rest of the UN Security Council---that
proliferation will result in a major retaliatory measure such as a
blockade. The first responsibility of a leader is to face reality.
Setting aside our previous belief that we can convince North Korea to
abandon its nuclear program will unlock the door to a different policy.
But there are still no easy answers. Indeed, a new policy requires even
more firmness and finesse---carefully calculated though it must
be---conducted across the full range of instruments of national and
international power to deter use and proliferation and to demonstrate to
other nations the high cost of commencing such a program.

shapes North Korea's foreign policy?,\" SAGE Journals,
https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/2233865916683602

[The theoretical framework of this research draws from a combination of
realism, liberalism, and constructivism to identify and examine possible
variables that affect North Korea's foreign policy behaviors. As realism
focuses on military power, allies, the international systems' structure,
and security concerns, it provides a powerful explanation of most
foreign policy choices for the Cold War politics. This is because
realists tend to see a state's foreign policy through the logic of
power-relationships evident during the bipolar competition of post-World
War II relations.]{.underline} That is, it sees states as "satisficers,"
willing to enact foreign policy in so far as it meets their
minimum-security needs, but no further. In contrast, [liberals prefer
the logic of "procedural legitimacy" because they are most interested in
psychological prosperity or pragmatic values, and constructivists tend
to use the logic of acceptability because they are most concerned with
the values of community]{.underline} ([Chittick,
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/2233865916683602):
14[). In order to analyze DPRK's foreign policy, liberal and
constructivist interpretations of domestic and ideational factors are
more appropriate to understand certain foreign policy priorities of
North Korea, especially, in the post-Cold War era.]{.underline} In this
paper, we attempt to examine the hypothesis of this study that North
Korea's foreign policy toward South Korea is determined by legitimacy
competition. [The paper will address this hypothesis again through the
use of a historical process-tracing method as well as content analysis.
This focus on domestic politics implies that while Pyongyang's foreign
policy may appear to be a response to changes in other powerful states'
foreign policy, in fact it reflects the domestic environment in a number
of areas.]{.underline} If one fails to consider how a leader and his/her
prevailing ideas or ideologies shape its foreign relations, one may draw
out an inadequate analysis that perpetuates misunderstandings and
misperceptions ([Kim,
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/2233865916683602)).
In this vein, the state behavior and outcome in world politics are
determined by the configuration of interdependent state
preferences.[1](javascript:popRef('fn1-2233865916683602')) In [North
Korea, decision-makers have sought to negotiate foreign policies
relatively based on their preferences (i.e. regime survival, economic
benefits), rather than by structural determinants such as balance of
power and national interests. Moreover, North Korea's foreign policy
analysis tends to rely on domestic policy determinants]{.underline}.
Herbert Simon argues that one needs to know where preferences originate
([Simon,
1985](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/2233865916683602)).
In this research, domestic priorities of foreign policies are based on
three basic human motives (power, achievement, and social affiliation),
determine what individuals know about foreign policy, and should also
shape how they make decisions. In foreign policy, these three
motivations are transposable as security, identity, and prosperity
[Chittick
(2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/2233865916683602):
17).[2](javascript:popRef('fn2-2233865916683602')) Therefore, this paper
shows that [North Korean foreign policy goals are motivated by three
domestic priorities or preferences: security, identity, and prosperity.
In North Korea, first and foremost, the regime wishes to ensure its own
survival. Once survival is assured, then, it is expected to pursue a
regime identity. Furthermore, North Korea seeks prosperity on the basis
of the establishment of survival and identity]{.underline} ([Hong,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/2233865916683602)).
This research assumes that this perceived threat to North Korean
national identity is the primary force in shaping The Democratic
People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) policies toward the Republic of
Korea. Based on the theoretical reasoning above, a testable hypothesis
can be derived that the DPRK's foreign policy toward the The Republic of
Korea (ROK) is determined by the goal of maintaining "national
identity."

[Pandemic preparedness and control is the responsibility of a host of
public (and private) actors, and in the EU and the US these actors are
distributed across multiple levels of governance]{.underline}.
Comparison between these two blocs is useful, in that each shares a
variety of theoretically relevant characteristics.10 In both systems,
[securitization has taken place at the highest political
levels]{.underline}. In Europe, this includes the EU-level of governance
where both national officials speak collectively and where leaders of
the EU institutions (especially the European Commission) have a
semiautonomous voice in European safety and security issues. Through
changes to the EU's governing treaties over the past decades, EU
governments have invested more authority at the supranational level to
coordinate national responses to health threats and to serve as a common
platform for political responses. This explains why evaluating EU-level
rhetoric, in addition to national statements, on pandemics offers a
useful indication of securitization processes in action. In [the US, the
federal level plays a major role in stipulating general frameworks for
action, setting standards, and allocating resources, thus giving
national officials -- ranging from the US Secretaries for Health and
Homeland Security to the US President -- authority to describe and frame
pandemics to the broader public.]{.underline} As we see below, the [US,
too, has taken part in securitizing the pandemic issue]{.underline}. In
both the EU and the US, the main operational [responsibility for public
health mostly lies at the local level.]{.underline} The supranational or
federal level plays an overarching, but typically indirect, role. In
between these layers of governance, states (in the US) and national
governments (in the EU) play various roles (with national governments in
Europe more powerful, holding the sovereign authority over public safety
and security, when compared to US states). [Thus each system consists of
multiple levels of authority and responsibility, with high level
political actors capable of making statements, assertions, and even
directives that must be (to varying degrees) digested and implemented at
lower levels.]{.underline} As we shall see, then, the two systems offer
a useful opportunity to compare the extent to which high level
intentions are carried out or dashed at lower levels. Finally, in both
the EU and the US, the exact distribution of authority and
responsibility between governance levels is not always clear. In times
of crisis, this is especially the case. The problem is exacerbated in
the EU, where the EU's common treaties offer only general indications of
the EU's role and stipulates public health as a "mixed competence" --
where the national level dominates but the supranational level has the
authority to issue binding legal instruments in some cases. Moreover,
the EU's role in public health per se is qualified by the sometimes
overlapping role of international bodies like World Health Organization
(WHO)-Europe and collaborative networks like the Global Health Security
Initiative and the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN), an
international team of experts in epidemiology. Despite these small
differences, governance efforts in both the EU and the US must contend
with shifting patterns of authority. Similar characteristics between the
EU and the US governance systems enables a fruitful comparison of the
extent to which words follow action, or more prosaically, the extent to
which high-level rhetoric is followed by actual implementation on the
question of pandemic preparedness and control. Of course, an article of
this length cannot fully explore this phenomenon, but the indicators we
sketch out below and the empirics presented allow us to make a
preliminary assessment. Making such an assessment has important
theoretical relevance. [Scholars focused on "securitization" are
concerned with process-oriented conceptions of security, including how
an issue is transformed by an actor into a security
question]{.underline}.[11 This process, which is carried out through
rhetoric, framing and other forms of social persuasion (largely
intentional, or at least opportunistically) by political leaders,
bureaucrats, governments, lobbyists and/or pressure groups must be
accepted by an audience as an "existential problem" if securitization is
to occur]{.underline}.12 Once securitization takes place, the theory
suggests, extraordinary means can be used in a seemingly legitimate way
to tackle the problem. According to Williams, this can include access to
new sources of financing, extra-legislative means of making policy, and
arms-length distance from democratic oversight.13 More specifically for
our purposes here, the act of securitization is linked to the process of
executive empowerment. Political leaders are typically in the center of
securitization efforts, the effects of which are to lend considerable
latitude to politicians in order to solve a perceived problem. The
effect, as many studies show, is to empower political leadership and
lend additional authority in exacting change.14 This includes
implementation,15 where "extraordinary means" may be formal edicts
(presidential directives, executive orders) but may also be less formal
acts including rousing speeches, high-profile agenda-setting and even
personal encouragement. **[The details of the means are less important
for our purposes than the theorized effect]{.underline}**: as Huysmans
argues, **[securitization can lend weight to new initiatives and
motivates subordinate officials into action]{.underline}**.16 From this
perspective, [securitization should enhance the likelihood of
implementation by concentrating minds and motivating extra effort by
administrative officials in other governance levels and
domains.]{.underline}17

[As demonstrated, and put simply, the evidence above suggests **a
considerable amount of "follow through" following political
prioritization**]{.underline} -- [and securitization]{.underline} -- [of
pandemic preparedness in both the EU and the US. On the question of
securitization, **political leaders**]{.underline} in both blocs
**[succeeded in prioritizing pandemics as a key security
challenge]{.underline}**. The EU and the [US expressed similar
perspectives on pandemics as an issue transcending "politics" and
traditional security-related disagreements]{.underline} (such as on the
question of Iraq, to use one notable example). As most authors agree
that [pandemics have been successfully securitized]{.underline} on both
sides of the Atlantic, the securitization finding is not surprising. One
pattern to note between the EU and the US is the rhetoric deployed in
their respective strategic documents. The US appeared more eager to
label pandemics a security threat earlier than did the EU. Both see the
synergies to be achieved by preparing for pandemics and preparing for
other largescale public health emergencies, such as an anthrax attack[.
What truly interests us here, however, is examining the reality of
moving from talk to action]{.underline}. [The securitization literature,
as discussed in the second section above, leads us to believe that a
securitized issue will lead to more forceful and deliberate
implementation in general terms. Our results seem to bear out this
expectation, with considerable progress in the areas of surveillance,
early warning, and control witnessed on both sides of the
Atlantic]{.underline}. Over the time period studied, EU and US leaders'
[intentions were carried out to a considerable degree, with new or
revised programs, new instruments, new forms of financial assistance,
and newly empowered bureaucratic organizations. The empirics presented
above demonstrate this development in a convincing fashion]{.underline}.

[Global health issues, and especially risks from disease outbreaks, have
risen ever higher on the international political agenda in the last two
decades. The harbinger for this change was the emergence in the 1980s of
HIV/AIDS, a novel communicable disease which at its height led to the
deaths of more than 2 million people a year, and threatened the
stability of states and the security of regions]{.underline}. [Since
then, outbreaks of other infectious diseases, such as severe acute
respiratory syndrome, SARS (2002--2003), Middle East respiratory
syndrome, MERS (2012), Ebola (2014-- 15) and Zika (2015--16), recurrent
alarms about pandemic forms of influenza such as avian flu (2005) and
swine flu (2009), and concerns over antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have
all appeared prominently on the international agenda. The UN General
Assembly has held multiple meetings on health issues since 2000,
including on HIV (2001, 2011, 2016), non-communicable diseases (2011,
2014), the Ebola response (2014) and AMR (2016); the HIV/AIDS pandemic
and the Ebola outbreak triggered resolutions by the UN Security Council
(nos 1308, 1983, 2176 and 2177), which declared that these outbreaks may
constitute risks to stability as well as to national and international
peace and security; and numerous new programmes]{.underline},
[organizations and initiatives have emerged at the global level, both
within the UN system (such as UNAIDS13 and the WHO Global Outbreak Alert
and Response Network14) and outside it, notably in the form of
public--private partnerships such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.1]{.underline}5
[This rise was accompanied by a new narrative under the slogan that
'health is global': that in the era of globalization]{.underline},
**[health problems are increasingly global in their effect and
consequently require global responses]{.underline}** (what is frequently
termed 'global health governance').16 **[Outbreaks of infectious disease
in particular were 13 newly identified as being a global
risk]{.underline}**, [given their potentially rapid spread between
states and across continents through accelerated travel and
trade]{.underline}. In 2002--2003, for example, the SARS outbreak
demonstrated how **[novel viruses could spread across continents within
weeks]{.underline}**. [Crucially, it also led to the WHO taking a
proactive leadership role, prompting]{.underline} David Fidler to
comment that health had moved into a 'post-Westphalian' phase.17
Although Fidler's claim was at best premature,18 the term '[global
health' drew new political attention to, and implied the need for new
political initiatives concerning, health.]{.underline} Not least of its
effects was [**that this discursive shift allowed health risks to be
constructed as shared between and across states.** The potential of
infectious diseases to spread quickly across the globe also meant that,
for the first time in several generations, high-income states appeared
vulnerable to outbreaks of infectious disease]{.underline}. At the same
time, [the increasing prominence of global health has brought with it an
increasingly prominent global health politics.]{.underline} While the
HIV/AIDS pandemic was portrayed as a risk to global stability and
security, it also revealed stark differences in how vulnerable
populations were to becoming infected and in their ability to access
[treatment. Different interests, perspectives and values have also
become apparent with regard to which health issues to prioritize in
global health governance, with many high-income countries focusing on
infectious disease outbreaks with pandemic potential and---more
recently---AMR, while low-income countries are often more concerned with
strengthening local health systems to address endemic diseases and the
many 'neglected' diseases that kill thousands of poor people every
day]{.underline}.19 Furthermore, the rise of global health politics is
also linked to a growing recognition that health issues have
implications beyond the physical and mental well-being of individuals
and communities. These include national and international security,
macroeconomic growth, international development, human rights, and
global commerce and trade. In January 2000, for example, at its first
meeting of the new millennium, the UN Security Council addressed the
international security implications of HIV/AIDS; later that year it
passed Resolution 1308, principally concerning the risks posed by the
disease to peacekeeping missions but also 'stressing that the HIV/AIDS
pandemic, if unchecked, may pose a risk to stability and security'.20
Also in 2000, the Millennium Development Goals recognized health, and
especially high-incidence communicable diseases such as HIV and malaria,
as risks to sustainable development and human rights; and in 2001, the
Report of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, chaired by
Jeffrey D. Sachs, identified poor health as a risk to macroeconomic
growth. More recently, in 2014 the Security Council passed Resolution
2177, identifying the west African Ebola outbreak as a 'threat to
international peace and security'. [Global health, then, is not a policy
silo, but has become part of the business of institutions outside the
narrowly defined field of international health organizations; and these
institutions bring their own interests, ideas and values to debates on
global health issues.21 Indeed, such is the contemporary fungibility
around the topic that interests, ideas and values from health have in
turn permeated thinking in other sectors, such as security and
trade]{.underline}.22

[While the rise of global health politics is intrinsically linked to the
rise of global health more generally]{.underline}, [there is a notable
tension between these two phenomena. Politics sits uneasily with both
the emphasis on the global nature of health problems and the tradition
of public health as a technical field grounded in positivism and
scientific rationality]{.underline}. [The implicitly cosmopolitan notion
of 'global' health establishes a normative expectation that health is
superordinate. But the idea that health issues are shared in an age of
globalization tends to obscure the facts that some populations are more
likely to be affected by health problems than others, that some health
issues are more relevant in some countries than in others, and that
policy responses tend to benefit some people more than others. The field
of global health and global health governance is also dominated by
policy-makers and experts with a background in public health,
epidemiology and medicine, long permeated by an ethos of positivism and
scientific rationality.]{.underline}23 In this tradition, rigorous
observation, high-quality data and the application of reason can
identify both the likelihood of infection and the best response to a
given problem: an approach seen across health policy and practice, from
the treatment of disease to the allocation of resources. [The idea is
that there is an optimal solution to a given problem]{.underline}, which
[can be arrived at through **the use of a robust empirical
methodology**. Risks can be scientifically assessed]{.underline} through
**[rigorous observation of events and the application of lessons derived
from deductive reasoning]{.underline}**. [Failures]{.underline} to
resolve global health risks---such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the west
African Ebola outbreak or the rise of AMR---[are therefore often
ascribed to either poor data, weak reasoning, inadequate resources or
interference in the scientific process by partial forces (often decried
as 'political' interference).]{.underline}

## Iran Reps Good

### Iran Bad 

#### Iran frequently takes irrational actions and are unpredictable even if there is some rationality behind their decisions.

**Singh 12** -- (Michael Singh is managing director at the Washington
Institute. He was senior director for Middle East affairs at the U.S.
National Security Council from from 2005 to 2008, "Is the Iranian regime
rational?",
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/02/23/is-the-iranian-regime-rational/>,
Published FEBRUARY 23, 2012, Accessed July 20, 2019, njt)

In a recent remark that has stoked considerable controversy, Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey said that it is. Dempsey
underscored the importance of this assertion when he said that it was
based on this conclusion --- that the regime is a \"rational actor\" ---
that he felt the current U.S. approach to Iran \"is the most prudent
path.\"

To determine whether Gen. Dempsey is right or wrong, it is important to
understand what it means for a government to act rationally. It does not
necessarily imply that the government sees the world the way we do, or
makes the decisions we would make. Simply put, there are two essential
criteria for rationality --- first, that decisions are arrived at
through a process of logical reasoning; second, that the decisions made
are the best ones given the choices available.

Most discussions of whether the Iranian regime is rational focus on the
first criterion. Does the regime make its choices by weighing costs and
benefits, or through a capricious process guided by whim and claims of
divine revelation? The U.S. intelligence community believes that it is
the former: for all of the regime's unhinged rhetoric, the regime is
calculating in its decisionmaking. The 2007 National Intelligence
Estimate on Iran's nuclear program puts it this way: \"Tehran's
decisions are guided by a cost-benefit approach rather than a rush to a
weapon irrespective of the political, economic, and military costs.\"

However, this conclusion raises a critical question --- what does the
Iranian regime see as costly, and what does it see as beneficial?

This leads to the second criterion for rationality: [a rational actor
makes the best decision given the choices available. But \"best\"
according to whose interests, and whose values?]{.underline} Whether an
action is costly or beneficial, and thus whether a decision is best,
depends vitally on the answers to these questions. Our own domestic
political experience --- witness the Democrat-Republican divide over the
national debt --- demonstrates that two rational actors, faced with the
same sets of facts and circumstances but holding different interests,
philosophies, or values, can reach very different conclusions about what
to do.

So [for a conclusion that the Iranian regime is rational to be useful in
predicting its behavior --- not to mention making and judging our own
policy --- we must assess how the regime perceives its interests.
Otherwise the \"costs\" we impose may not be viewed as costly by the
regime, and the \"benefits\" we offer may not be seen as
beneficial.]{.underline}

All indications are that the regime values its own survival above all.
This likely fuels its drive to obtain a nuclear weapon, which it may see
as a guarantee against external foes. To the extent the regime defines
its interests parochially rather than as national interests, it may also
discount the economic suffering of the Iranian people except to the
extent it leads to political turmoil. Thus, to be perceived as truly
\"costly\" by the regime, any sanctions or other measures imposed or
threatened by the U.S. and our allies must place at risk the regime's
interests, including its prospects for survival. What's more, they must
threaten those interests so much that the regime is willing to sacrifice
something it apparently values greatly --- a nuclear weapon.

Likewise, any benefit offered by the U.S. and our allies, if it is to
affect the regime's calculus, must be seen by the regime as advancing
its interests. [Many things the U.S. sees as \"carrots\" --- for
example, free trade or normal diplomatic relations --- may in fact be
seen as threatening to an authoritarian regime which is leery of the
West. Conversely, what the regime would see as beneficial --- for
example, assurances that the U.S. would cease its support for human
rights or democracy in Iran --- we are unlikely to be willing to
offer.]{.underline}

There are two other important points to consider about how the regime
decides which option facing it is best. First, [we must be aware that
there are other costs and benefits at play than simply the ones we
generate through sanctions or diplomatic appeals. Individuals in the
regime face their own incentives --- for example personal wealth
generated in the black markets that sanctions give rise to --- as well
as disincentives --- for example the possibility of ending up imprisoned
or worse for too vocally bucking the regime's line.]{.underline}

Second[, we must also be aware that the regime likely lacks complete
information or anything close to it.]{.underline} This is where the
assumption that Iran acts rationally runs into the most trouble.
[Decisions in Iran are made by]{.underline} one man --- Ali
[Khamenei.]{.underline} By all accounts, [he]{.underline} has not
traveled outside Iran since becoming Supreme Leader in 1989, [is likely
insulated by his aides from bad news or criticism, and depends on an
increasingly narrow and homogenous power base which may not expose him
to alternative opinions. One is unlikely to make a good decision if
ill-informed or unaware of all the options. Nor can the regime make
accurate judgments about U.S. intentions if we do not clearly
communicate our policies or red lines.]{.underline}

There are indeed examples that suggest rational cost-benefit
decisionmaking by the Iranian regime, including the one cited in the
2007 NIE --- the regime's apparent decision to suspend its nuclear
\"weaponization\" research in 2003 following the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
But other Iranian actions seem untethered from cost-benefit
considerations. For example, [why would Iran try to blow up a restaurant
in Washington in an effort to assassinate the Saudi ambassador, when
such an action could spark a war that Iran would surely lose? Or, why
would Iran not make a show of cooperation with the IAEA delegation that
recently visited Iran, if for no other reason than to delay an Israeli
military strike that seems increasingly likely?]{.underline}

More importantly, [even if we were to conclude that the Iranian regime
is a rational actor, we would not necessarily be able to predict its
decisions or behavior. We have a poor understanding of how the regime
sees its interests, what it perceives as costly and beneficial, what
information is available to its leader, and therefore what it would
consider the best decision in a given circumstance. And of course, even
otherwise rational actors are prone to the occasional --- and sometimes
very consequential --- irrational decision. And in an authoritarian
state with an aging and increasingly isolated leader, this risk goes up
exponentially.]{.underline}

#### Iran supports terror -- it's a threat to US interests.

Introduction In the course of twenty-five years of Islamic rule
(1979-2004), [Iran has appeared to be a state that supports a radical
foreign policy with no holds barred, including terror, in order to
export the Islamic revolution and facilitate its political
objectives.]{.underline} The use of terror as a tool to further
political interests is not exclusive or unique to Iran, but there is no
doubt that during the re- viewed period Iran was among the most
prominent countries to encourage terror and use it to realize its goals
on the international level. In a speech delivered in February 2002, U.S.
President George Bush de- fined Iran as a member of the \"Axis of Evil\"
that supports terror and is involved in an attempt to create weapons for
mass destruction. Since the beginning of the 1980s, Iran has appeared on
the U.S. State Department\'s list of states that support terror. Indeed,
since the Islamic revolution in 1979, Iran was one of the leading
countries to use terror to promote its objectives in the international
arena. This volume aspires to comprehend the motives behind Iran\'s
methodical use of terror as a tool to achieve its international goals,
and strives to elaborate the way that terror is actively integrated into
achieving of these goals. It discusses the issue of Iranian
state-supported terror from as wide an angle as possible, and does not
limit itself to the Israeli aspect and the connection to the
Arab-Israeli conflict. The study emphasizes that [Iran views terror as
an effective tool to further its objectives, as a substitute for or
supplementary measure to diplomatic processes, and that terror
constitutes a \"legitimate\" means in the Iranian regime\'s battle
against its external and internal rivals and enemies.]{.underline} From
an in-depth analysis of terror attacks perpetrated during the reviewed
period (1980-2003), based on data provided by research institutes and
publications in the media, it is possible to point to hundreds of
interna- tional attacks perpetrated by Iranian entities or
Shiite/PaIestinian-sponsored organizations (on an average, slightly more
than one attack per month over a period that exceeds twenty years). This
study analyzes the phenomenon of Iranian and Shiite terror according to
these characteristics: • The ideological and religious background
vis-a-vis the use of terror, and the Iranian intelligence and terror
agencies; The various categories of Iranian state terror (terror
perpetrated against foreign targets on Iranian soil, Iranian terror
worldwide, and particu- larly Iranian terror \"via proxy\"); The modi
operandi of the Iranian and Shiite terror (suicide attacks, attacks
against aviation targets, attacks via explosive devices, assassi-
nations, and the kidnapping of hostages; The targets of Iranian terror.
The following restrictions and reservations apply to the current study:
First, it is very difficult to provide a full description of Iranian and
Shiite terror due to the lack of official and recorded data and because
of attempts made by the perpetrators of terror attacks to cover their
tracks. Moreover, a police investi- gation of a terror incident
sometimes takes an extremely long time, and as a result, the identity of
the suspected perpetrators changes. In addition, during the Iran-Iraq
war, Iran and its proxies perpetrated hundreds of terror attacks against
Iraqi targets, but this activity was often incorporated within the ongo-
ing development of the war. Thus, the statistics in this study do not
include these activities, with the exception of terror activities
perpetrated against Iraq outside of its boundaries as well as terror
activity perpetrated in Iraq after the war. We will also refrain from
analyzing terror attacks perpetrated by the Hizballah organization
against the Israel Defense Forces during the period that it was
stationed in Lebanon. Nevertheless, the issue of Iranian and Shiite
terror against Israel is dis- cussed at length on four main levels:
Iran\'s approach to Israel and the Israel-Arab conflict; • Attacks
against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad; • Attacks against Israel
after its withdrawal from Lebanon (May 2000); Iranian and Hizballah
involvement in the Al Aksa Intifada (starting from September 2000). As
stated earlier, Iranian terror activity is perpetrated judiciously. Iran
en- deavors to leave no \"fingerprints\" that might identify it as the
force behind the terror activities. Moreover, in public declarations the
Iranian leadership ex- presses its reservations regarding terror and
condemns it; this is also true of sponsored organizations such as the
Hizballah. Iran\'s attempt to conceal the terror activities that it
perpetrates enables it to extract the maximum benefit from this
activity. On the one hand, this prevents the terror victim from retali-
ating, while on the other, Iran sometimes presents itself as a mediator
attempt- ing to achieve a compromise between the victim and the terror
organization. Using this method, Iran attains its goals from both
directions. Most of the information that has exposed Iran\'s involvement
in terror ac- tivities has come to light after perpetrators of acts of
terror were apprehended and brought to trial, as the result of
comprehensive intelligence investigations of terror attacks worldwide,
and following the perpetration of acts of terror where the claiming of
responsibility by the responsible organizations included declarations
and/or demands that clearly reflected an Iranian link between ter- ror
activity and Iranian foreign policy. Particularly evident is the
consistent and methodical usage of terror in order to force other
countries to accept Iranian demands after regular diplomatic channels
failed to achieve these goals. Never- theless, [although Iranian terror
policy may be portrayed as a rational and sober method to achieve
Iranian goals, it is important to point out several other phe- nomena
that have significant impact on the formulation of Iranian
policy:]{.underline} The use of terror in the international arena
constitutes a focal point for controversy in the higher echelons of the
Iranian regime, between the circles often termed \"moderate\" and those
considered \"radical,\" and which support the uncompromising struggle
against the enemies of the revolution. Thus, [to a significant degree
the scope of the use of terror and its objectives reflects the internal
power struggles inside Iran. Iran has often conducted an ambivalent
foreign policy, with the \"mod- erates,\" aspiring to negotiate and
reach compromise, while at the same time \"radical\" entities continue
to be involved in acts of terror]{.underline} (some- times with the aim
of \"torpedoing\" the steps initiated by the \"moder- ates\"). Iran\'s
ambivalent policy has provided it with flexibility in its political
course and has made it difficult for its adversaries to formu- late a
forceful policy that will provide an adequate response to Iranian
terror, due to the assumption that the moderate elements in the Iranian
regime must be encouraged vis-å-vis the extremists, as they are \"the
lesser of two evils.\" [Khomeini\'s theory, which calls for \"Shiite
activism\" and \"revolutionary violence,\" paved the way and provided
ideological and religious legitimiza- tion for the use of terror. Thus,
Iranian terror is motivated by a combination of religious and
ideological motives and political needs.]{.underline} The dilemma
regarding the issue of Iranian leadership (moderates versus extremists)
stems primarily from an observation angle and judgment formu- lated
according to Western norms and values. [A close examination of the deeds
and declarations of the Iranian leaders, both moderate and extremists,
leads us to the conclusion that in reality the more accurate
differentiation would be between radical and more radical
leadership.]{.underline} As long as Khomeini\'s theories serve as a
source for legitimization and as a guide for Iranian leadership, the
differences between the radical elements and the moderate ones will be
ex- pressed in varying approaches to achieving goals, but not in their
fundamen- tal essence. In general, Iranian involvement in terror can be
divided into three main eras; 1. The \"revolutionary\" period, during
Khomeini\'s regime---1979-1989, and the period of \"Khomieni\'s
successsors,\" which can be divided into two sections: 2. The period of
Rafsanjani\'s rule---1989-1997 3. The period of Khatami\'s
rule---1997-2003. This study indicates a significant difference between
the eras vis-ä-vis Ira- nian terror activity, which was at its most
intensive level during the Khomeini era but decreased significantly
during the reign of his successors. During Khatami\'s term as Iranian
president there has been a significant drop in Iran\'s involvement in
terror, with the exception of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Lebanese
and Palestinian arenas. [Iran was the first to introduce suicide terror
into the combat arsenal of the Mid-Eastern arena]{.underline} (see
further elaboration in chapter 3). In this regard, [its approach has not
changed since the 1980s, and even today it encourages the Palestinians
to use terror and suicide attacks as a strategic means in their struggle
against the State of Israel.]{.underline}

#### Depictions of Iran as a state sponsor of terror are empirically based in fact -- American deterrence is key to prevent war.

The [Iranian terror activity was implemented in a rational manner, with
Iran endeavoring not to leave fingerprints that would identify it as the
entity be- hind the terror activity]{.underline}. Moreover, in public
statements the Iranian leadership expressed its reservations regarding
terror attacks and condemned them, and this also applied to its
sponsored organizations, for example, the Hizballah. Iran\'s attempt to
conceal the terror activity that it perpetrated enabled it to derive the
maximum benefit from this activity---on the one hand, it barred the
terror victim from retaliating for its activity, and on the other, it
sometimes presented itself as a go-between striving to reach a
compromise between the victim and the terror organizations. This way it
was able to achieve its goals on both ends. [Most of the information
that exposed Iran\'s involvement in terror activity surfaced due to the
apprehension of the terror perpetrators and in their subse- quent
trials, following intensive investigations of attacks by law enforcement
and intelligence agencies in various places worldwide, and also as the
result of terror activity in which the entities\' claiming of
responsibility included decla- rations and/or demands that clearly
reflected Iranian interests. The most promi- nent milestones in this
connection are the investigation of the attacks in Argentina during the
years 1992 and 1994, the attack at al-Khobar in Saudi Arabia, the
Mikonos affair, and the capture of the Karin A.]{.underline} It is
possible to trace a strong connection between terror activity and
Iran\'s foreign policy. The consistent and systematic use of terror in
order to force Iranian wishes on other countries after a goal had not
been achieved through acceptable diplomatic means is conspicuous.
Typical examples are Kuwait and France, which during the 1980s were the
main targets for Iranian/Shiite terror activity, mainly due to their
positions regarding the Iran-Iraq war and the aid they offered to Iraq.
In most cases the terror weapon was activated in order to achieve a wide
range of Iranian objectives vis-å-vis the victim. For example, [Iran\'s
demands of France during the 1980s included the removal of its forces
from Lebanon, cessation of French military aid for Iraq, a change in its
stand vis-ä-vis the Arab-Israeli conflict, return of the Iranian funds
frozen in France, deportation of expatriates and Iranian opposition
organizations from French soil, and the release of Shiite terrorists
arrested in France. These objectives were achieved one after the other
through a series of various kinds of terror attacks (car bombs,
abduction of hostages, sabotage, and more), which ultimately led to
repeated French capitulations to most of the Iranian
demands.]{.underline} The timing of most of the terror attacks was
planned very carefully, and was meant to serve political processes by
negotiating with the victim or sometimes as a catalyst to launching the
negotiations. Although one might purportedly gauge the Iranian terror
policy as a ratio- nal and pragmatic policy aimed at achieving Iran\'s
goals, it is important to point out additional phenomena that also play
an important role in the formu- lation of Iranian policy: [The use of
terror in the international arena constitutes a central point of dispute
in the higher echelons of the Iranian regime between the circles that
are called \"moderate\" and the \"radical\" circles that support a ruth-
less struggle against the enemies of the revolution.]{.underline} Thus,
to a large extent the scope of the utilization of terror and its targets
also reflect the internal power struggles in Iran. Iran has often
advocated an ambivalent foreign policy, according to which the
\"moderates\" aspire to negotiate and reach compromises, while the
\"radicals\" continue with the terror activity (sometimes in order to
\"torpedo\" the steps taken by the moderates.) [Iran\'s ambivalent
policy has generally provided it with flexibility vis- å-vis its
political steps and has made it difficult for its adversaries to
advocate a tough policy which will provide a response to Iranian ter-
ror, mostly due to the assumption that the moderate entities within the
Iranian regime must be encouraged in their struggle against the radical
entities, from the aspect of the \"lesser of two evils.\"]{.underline}
There are several examples where Iranian willingness to sacrifice
political interests on the ideological altar is evident---the most
prominent example illustrating this issue is the Salman Rushdie affair.
By sentencing the British writer to death, Khomeini instigated a
confrontation with the Western democ- racies, as this issue placed the
Islamic values and principles opposite the values of the democratic
Western civilization. This affair gives us insight into the nature of
the Islamic leadership: First and foremost, this is one issue about
which there was a total consensus be- tween the radicals and the
moderates, that is, that Rushdie must die. Secondly, even after
Khomeini\'s demise, and under Rafsanjani and Khatami\'s leader- ship, it
was made unequivocally clear that the verdict would remain valid
(although Iran would not act to execute it). Thus, it is clear that
there are basic religious and ideological values about which there
exists a consensus in the Iranian regime, while in matters that are less
fundamental, the Iranian policy is pragmatic and is primarily motivated
by cost/benefit considerations. The dilemma regarding the nature of the
Iranian leadership (moderates or reformists opposite radicals) stems
mainly from the angle of observation and judgment according to Western
norms and values. [A close investigation of the deeds and statements of
the Iranian leaders, both moderate and radical, leads us to the
conclusion that a more accurate differentiation should be made be- tween
radical and more radical leadership]{.underline}. As long as Khomeini\'s
philosophy is maintained as the source of legitimization and as a guide
for Iranian leader- ship, the differences between the radical and
moderate elements will be ex- pressed in different approaches to achieve
goals, but not in their very essence. In the matter of Iran\'s control
over sponsored Shiite and Palestinian organi- zations, it is important
to note that throughout the entire reviewed period Iran demonstrated
control and influence over the sponsored organizations. But this
statement must also be qualified because the control and influence over
sponsored organizations are sometimes in the hands of entities that are
not necessarily at the head of Iran\'s official leadership. Thus, it
would be fair to say that the internal power struggles in Iran have a
significant influence on the sponsored organizations that follow the
orders of various factors in the Iranian regime. One must also stress
that the extent of Iranian control over its spon- sored organizations is
also influenced by its cooperation with its strategic ally, Syria. Let
us also keep in mind that the sponsored organizations have their own
goals and needs, which sometimes do not completely match the interests
of the \"patron.\" In this connection it is possible to observe that in
most terror attacks the Shiite and Palestinian terror organizations
raised demands that included the release of terrorists incarcerated in
various countries as well as ransoms (demands that first and foremost
serve the organizations themselves). The arrest of Shiite terrorists in
various countries over the world turned the latter into victims of
attacks although sometimes they were not initially planned to be the
target of terror activity (for example, Switzerland and Germany).
Attacks against these countries did not generally serve Iranian
interests, and were directed at bringing about the release of the
imprisoned terrorists. Many books and articles have been written about
how to contend with terror, and most argue that the capitulation to
terror invites additional acts of terror. The conclusions that I must
draw from this study do not fully validate this assumption. As stated
earlier, among the most prominent states that fell victim to Iranian
terror were France and Kuwait; France\'s policy was indeed characterized
by repeated capitulation to the demands of the Shiite and Ira- nian
terror organizations, and therefore the example of France verifies the
theory that submission to terror invites additional terrorist acts. But
on the other hand, Kuwait stood out due to its consistent policy not to
give in to terror extortion under any circumstances, but despite this
stand, or perhaps because of it, Kuwait suffered a particularly high
number of attacks. Therefore, [capitulation or non-capitulation to
terror is just one component out of a wide range of components that
ultimately determine if the terror will continue or cease, and it is
impossible to regard uncompromising refusal to give in to terror as a
\"wonder-formula\" to prevent terror. Moreover, in certain situations
this brought on even graver consequences. It appears that Iranian terror
is basically motivated by rational consider- ations (in addition to
ideological and other motives, which should not be dismissed
offhandedly). Thus, in most cases the use of terror is weighed ac-
cording to cost/benefit calculations, and the decision is an offshoot of
this reckoning.]{.underline} The main reason for this phenomenon stems
from rational calcula- tions on the part of the entities behind the
terror regarding risks and the ability to obtain achievements vis-ä-vis
the terror victim. In the overall balance Iran could (justifiably) have
reached the conclusion that terror pays off. The Iranian balance in this
issue testifies to a fairly impres- sive success rate in achieving
political targets in comparison to a relatively low price that it has
been made to pay, at least to date. But this picture has changed in the
aftermath of September I I, 2001, and the U.S. declaration of war
against global terror, events that constitute milestones and historical
turn- abouts in the way that the world contends with terror. The United
States de- fines Iran as one of the Axis of Evil countries and has made
it a central target in its struggle against terror. In light of the
determination that the United States has demonstrated in its fight
against terror in two campaigns that it has suc- cessfully fought to
date---in Afghanistan and in Iraq---and which ended with the toppling of
the pro-terror regimes and in the creation of a new regional and global
reality, Iran now faces an unprecedented challenge vis-ä-vis the terror
strategy that it has employed to date with great success. Iran, which is
experi- encing internal disputes between reformists and conservatives,
is also cur- rently facing American demands to introduce an essential
change in its policy regarding two main issues: • Cessation of support
for terror and terminating its utilization; • Shelving its plans to
acquire weapons for mass destruction and the means to launch them. These
American demands are backed up by the U.S. military presence on Iran\'s
borders with Afghanistan and Iraq, and by the increasing American
influence in the Muslim republics on Iran\'s northern border. The United
States is also taking determined action vis-ä-vis Syria---Iran\'s
strategic ally---and demanding that it cease its aid to Palestinian
terror organizations and to the Hizballah, and prevent the Hizballah\'s
terror activity from South Lebanon. (A similar demand was also made on
the Lebanese administration, along with the demand to deploy the
Lebanese army along the border with Israel instead of the Hizballah\'s
militia that is currently aligned there). A positive Syrian re- sponse
to the American demands will impair and significantly reduce Iran\'s
ability to aid the terror organizations supported by them today,
primarily the Hizballah and the Palestinian terror organizations, such
as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Jibril Front, the Hamas, and more.
Following the American steps to implement the peace initiative (The Road
Map) between Israel and the Palestinians, Iran has come up against
escalating problems in the Palestinian arena as well. Since the
beginning of the Al Aksa Intifada, Iran has been one of the strongest
supporters of the armed struggle against Israel, and directly and
indirectly has aided Palestinian entities that were involved in the
conflict. [Iran was one of the few countries that did noth- ing to
conceal its intention to bring about Israel\'s destruction, and it acted
to facilitate this concept by supporting the Palestinian armed struggle
and con- stantly eroding Israel\'s social and economic strength. But
when the United States succeeded in mobilizing most of the Arab world in
support of the Road Map during the Aqaba and Sharm-a-Sheikh conferences,
Iran remained iso- lated in its opposition to the growing
consensus]{.underline}. At first, Iran acted to torpedo the Road Map and
attempted to sabotage Abu-Mazen\'s efforts to form a gov- ernment. Avi
Dichter, head of the General Security Services (GSS), noted in this
connection that \"Iran is trying to fan the flames of terror in order to
make Abu-Mazen\'s assumption of his role more difficult.\" He noted that
\"Iran is placing pressure on the various terror organizations to act
against Abu-Mazen and not to consent to a ceasefire \"51 But,
subsequently, Iran was forced to fall into line, if only temporarily.
Reflection of Iran\'s distress in this connection can be seen in its
consent to the \"Hudna\" (cease fire) which was achieved between the
Palestinian factions, while even its closer protégés---the Palestin- ian
Islamic Jihad, the Hamas, and the factions in the Fatah that enjoy its
support---joined the agreement. Perhaps for the first time, Iran is
currently facing the need to introduce a strategic change in its
approach to the issue of the utilization of terror, and the Iranian
resolution will undoubtedly also be affected by the controversy that now
exists in Iranian society and within the higher levels of government,
between those who support the reformist approach and those who oppose it
At this point in time it is impossible to state what Iran\'s policy will
be changed regarding the issue of terror, but [there is no doubt that
Iran\'s ability to support the terror organizations acting under its
patronage has been impaired due to the massive American presence in the
Middle Eastern arena. An Iranian decision not to concede to the U.S.
demands may place it in a political and perhaps even military
confrontation with the United States, which is deter- mined to take
resolute action against global terror and the states that support
it.]{.underline} The ongoing \"chaos\" in Iraq is Iran\'s \"insurance
policy,\" for if there were peace and quiet in Iraq the Americans might
decide to pay more attention to Iran. The coalition\'s failure to
stabilize the situation in Iraq forces them to maintain a military
presence and they suffer from a growing number of losses and a reduced
legitimacy for their presence in Iraq. Iran\'s terrorist record
described above coupled with its operational and technological prowess
mean that Iran could become a serious threat to any opponent---even the
United States. Iran could act: • Against American allies • Against
American targets around the world • Against targets in the United
States. Iran could act directly through its revolutionary guard and
intelligence or indirectly through terrorist organizations. Iran has the
ability to attack its targets by means of conventional and
unconventional weapons. One must emphasize that lately most of the
attention in the United States and around the world is focused on Al
Qaida and its terrorism, but [one should take into account that an
Iranian decision to initiate an intensive terror cam- paign against the
United States would be a far greater challenge than one Al Qaida poses
today]{.underline} (Iranian cooperation with Al Qaida is also not out of
the question---especially joint ventures against American targets). [The
United States must aspire to create a situation in which it is able to
deter Iran from attacking American targets around the world and at home.
If, however, deterrence proves ineffective America must go on the
offensive or at least engage in operations designed to thwart terrorist
attacks outside of its borders or to exact a price from Iran that would
dissuade it from persisting in its terrorist camping. Terror supporting
countries, among them Iran, usually calculate potential gains and losses
and take into account the international response to their activities.
Each country sets the maximum price it is willing to pay for its
continued involvement in terrorism]{.underline}. The \"price range\"
differs from country to country as does the \"breaking point.\" This
means that countries combating terror have to exact a higher price from
countries that support terror---a price so high that these countries
will eventually decide that supporting terror is unprofitable. [The
possibility that Iran may renew its attacks was suggested by a senior
member of the Revolutionary Guard just a few months ago]{.underline}. In
a May 2004 article, the London-based Arabic daily al-Sharq al-Awsat
quoted senior Ira- nian officials regarding Iran\'s position vis-å-vis
the West, Israel, the war in Iraq, and suicide attacks. These statements
reflect, the current position of Iran \' s conservative elite. The
following is an excerpt from a speech by a senior member of the
Revolutionary Guard to student members of the \"Anassar Hizballah\"
organi- zation at Al-Hussein University. The west sees us terrorists and
describes our strategy as one of terror and oppression. If our youth
ever agreed to Khatami\'s edicts and commentary, he \[Khatami\] would
never fight the \[Western\] arrogance or protect the holy places,
because Khatami speaks Of lenience, reconciliation, tolerance and
opposition to terror, while we encour- age violence and warfare against
the enemies of revolutionary Islam. I am proud of my activities which
put fear into the Americans. Is it not true that the Jews and the
Christians further their goals by means of oppression and violence? We
have written strategy aimed at destroying Anglo-Saxon culture and
uprooting the Americans and the English. Our missiles are ready to
strike at their culture, and when the orders come from our leader (Ali
Khameini) we will launch our missiles at their cities and facilities.
Our motto during the Iraqi war was: \"Karbela we are coming, Jerusalem
we are coming,\" but because of Khatami \' s policies and his dialogue
between civilizations we have been forced to freeze our plan to free
Islamic cities. We are now ready, however, to proceed with the plan. He
added: The axis of blasphemy is an axis against Allah and the Muslims,
and we must do all in our power to strike at this axis by means of our
suicide attacks and our missiles. There are 29 sensitive sites in the
United States and the West. We have examined these sites and we know how
we\'ll attack them. The key to effectively facing the Iranian challenge
is adequate intelligence deployment which could provide at least some
warning of imminent attacks. Since the Iranian terrorist organizations
and Iranian-sponsored terrorist orga- nizations (such as the Hizballah)
are so effective and so compartmentalized, there is a dire need for more
human agents (\"Humint\") to gather information that would help thwart
attacks. [Since the Iranian terrorists infrastructure is global the
antiterrorist apparatus must be global as well. The terrorist attack-
ing American targets at home and abroad make sure to leave no \"Iranian
fingerprints,\" and the United States must have the global reach and the
neces- sary means to stop them.]{.underline}

#### Iran is a legitimate threat to the US.

The threat from Iran has changed to become \"more of a campaign\" than
previously, [according to]{.underline} General Joseph [Dunford, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staf]{.underline}f, with a \"perception that
activity would try to be synchronized in time.\" Dunford told a
Brookings Institution forum on May 29 that \"[we also saw in the
intelligence there was a question about both the will and capability of
the U.S. to respond\... Malign activity and threats to our forces by the
Iranians were not new, but a more widespread, almost campaign-like
perspective for the Iranians is.\"]{.underline} On May 28, the chief of
Iran\'s IRGC had echoed this, claiming Iran has \"experienced and
defeated all of the enemy's scenarios.\" Salami added that \"we have
been able to shatter enemy psyops and dry up the enemy's capacity for
war\... Iran's reach is no more confined to within its borders; Iran is
a robust power in the region\... We have received so many threats that
we are saturated.\" A day later, Iran\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas
[Araqchi said that \"Iran is prepared for the possibility of war with
the United States]{.underline}, we hope that we can start a dialogue,
but we are ready for war.\" Araqchi also claimed \"there are certain
elements and people who are trying to push the United States to war with
Iran for their own ends. However, we hope that wisdom will prevail in
Washington,\" adding that \"such a conflict would be catastrophic for
the entire Middle East.\" Araqchi\'s comments were later updated, to
deny that he had said he would welcome talks with the U.S. \"As we have
announced on repeated occasions,\" he clarified, \"there have been no
direct or indirect talks with the U.S.\" Araqchi was responding to
National Security Advisor John Bolton\'s claim that Iran was \"almost
certainly\" responsible for the sabotage of four oil tankers earlier in
the month. \"I think it is clear these \[attacks\] were naval mines
almost certainly from Iran,\" Bolton told reporters during a visit to
Abu Dhabi, adding that there had been a previously undisclosed attempted
attack on the Saudi Arabian port of Yanbu, although this was not
confirmed. \"Are there people who might like the United States to do
something?\" Dunford said. \"That speculation is out there, but I can
guarantee you, that\'s not going to inform the military advice I\'m
going to provide. I am very familiar with the consequences of going to
war and take the responsibility of providing military advice in that
regard seriously.\" \"Mr. Bolton and other warmongers,\" claimed a
spokesperson for Iran\'s Foreign Ministry, \"need to know that the
strategic patience, high vigilance and full defense readiness of the
Islamic Republic of Iran, which emanates from the strong resolve of its
great nation, will not let them fulfill their ominous schemes to create
chaos in the region.\" Bolton met Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Zayed on May 29 to discuss collaboration on counter-terrorism and
regional security, according to state media. Bolton also talked about
the broken nuclear deal which has been the cause of spiraling tensions
in recent weeks, suggesting that Iran\'s motivation for breaching its
obligations was down to atomic weapon aspiration: \"There's no reason
for them to do it unless it is to reduce the breakout time to nuclear
weapons,\" he told reporters. A German intelligence report published
this week appeared to back this up, claiming that Iran is \"making
efforts to expand its conventional arsenal of weapons with weapons of
mass destruction.\" The Bavarian Office for the Protection of the
Constitution, broadly equivalent to the FBI or MI5, defined this as
covering \"atomic bombs as well as biological and chemical weapons,\"
and claimed that \"in order to obtain the necessary know-how and
corresponding components, \[Iran, North Korea, Pakistan\] are trying to
establish business contacts to companies in highly technological
countries like Germany.\" In addition to the alleged attacks on Saudi
Arabia, [Iran also took the opportunity on May 29 of stirring further
tensions with Israel, America\'s other main ally in the region in
Iran\'s mind. Iranian President]{.underline} Hassan [Rouhani told
cabinet meeting that \"the Iranian nation has always helped other
nations, and we have helped the oppressed in Syria, Palestine, Lebanon,
Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen\... There was a time when the Palestinians
used to defend themselves only with rocks and stones, but today, they
have worked hard and developed a tool to give powerful responses to
Israelis".]{.underline} State media reported that \"Rouhani urged the
Iranian people to turn out en masse for Friday\'s \[Quds Day\] rallies
and to show their all-time support for the Palestinian nation in the
face of Israel until ultimate victory.\" \"The door of negotiations is
not closed,\" Rouhani said as regards the broader regional military
standoff, \"provided the U.S. lifts the sanctions and fulfills its
commitments.\" \"People can question the veracity of the intelligence,"
General Dunford said on May 29. \"All I would say is, since that
weekend[, there have been ships that have been hit with mines, there
have been \[drone\] strikes, there have been rocket strikes in the
proximity of the United States Embassy in Iraq]{.underline}. All since
the 3rd, 4th and the 5th \[of May\].\" [Forces deployed to the region,
Dunford said, \"were designed to enhance our force protection\...
accompanied by a message that this was not intended to be a provocation.
This is not intended to reinforce our offensive capability in the
region. This is designed to protect our people, much like the previous
force elements we sent in were designed to enhance our
deterrence.\"]{.underline} As ever, Iran\'s rhetoric servers multiple
audiences. [This week will likely see escalated tension and increased
bluster to incite public defiance in the eyes of the world\'s media. The
message that Iran is more up for a battle than its enemies has been
peddled for some time now. It is a theme that can be traced back through
recent weeks of military and political rhetoric from Iran\'s
leadership.]{.underline} And in poking at Israel and Saudi Arabia,
somewhere in the Teheran power structure this theory is being tested
out.

## Prolif Reps Good

### Critics Wrong 

#### Threat inflation critics fail to account for power-structures and empirircs. Their critique is just a self-indulgent discourse, divorced from the real world.

**Rythoven 16** (Eric Van Rythoven works for the Department of Political
Science at Carleton University. "The perils of realist advocacy and the
promise of securitization theory: Revisiting the tragedy of the Iraq War
debate", European Journal of International Relations 2016, Vol. 22(3),

The [failure of realist advocacy]{.underline}, despite its hegemonic
status within the discipline, [to curb the expansion of national
security agendas]{.underline} constitutes a genuine puzzle. Focusing
principally on the 2003 Iraq War debate, this article has leveraged the
tools of securitization theory to offer an explanation for this failure
centred around three contributions. First, [**by viewing the expansion
of the security agenda as a product of threat inflation** in the
marketplace of ideas, realists employed a liberal model of discourse
that stressed efficient economical reasoning over questions of
power]{.underline}. This was a model protected, in part, by the
incommensurability thesis. Second, [while generally competent
interlocutors in eyes of securitization theory, a closer examination of
realist advocacy reveals]{.underline} how ignoring identity and emotion
[ceded powerful cultural resources to their neoconservative
opponents]{.underline}. Third, the article sketched a common research
agenda for realism and securitization theory under the auspices of a
shared interest in the statecraft of threat construction. There is a
sense in which this argument is unfair to Walt and Mearsheimer, as well
as to other realists who opposed the 2003 Iraq War. Their advocacy may
have failed but so, too, did a host of other institutions (Kaufman,
2004), including a lacklustre political opposition, particularly among
elites, and an uncritical media. It may be more accurate to say that
this was a failure of the collective public sphere, rather than any one
actor or strategy (Tjalve, 2011). Yet, the significance of realist
advocacy cannot be dismissed. The fact that neoconservatives spent so
much time and energy engaging realist arguments, including agreeing to a
public debate with Walt and Mearsheimer in February Van Rythoven 503
2003, reflects how the intellectual architects of the war saw in realism
a trenchant and potent source of opposition. Equally important is the
concern that calling on realists to engage with the role of identity and
emotion in discourse challenges the traditional academia--policy divide.
In the Weberian view, appropriate scholarly activism entails 'entering
the debate in a nonpartisan way, and confining \[oneself\] to disclosing
"facts" rather than making pronouncements about "values"' (Jackson and
Kaufman, 2007: 95). Objectivity, in the Weberian sense, is crucial in
ensuring the authoritative nature of academic 'facts'. Yet, despite
their 'measured scholarly tones', such efforts can easily be read as
'obviously "political"' by the public and therefore be dismissed as
another partisan voice (Jackson and Kaufman, 2007: 99). This does not
mean that objectivity and, thus, authority are unimportant, but that
these concerns need to be balanced with a message sensitive to the
vicissitudes of power in discourse. Instead, it may be 'due to the very
subjectivity that some perceive as a liability' that some academics 'are
well positioned to issue the kinds of critiques that may resonate more
deeply' with popular audiences (Sucharov and Sasley, 2014: 177). Rather
than pursue a 'hygienic' objectivity, we might consider our attachments
to specific communities as reservoirs for thinking about richer forms of
public engagement. Finally, this critique of realist advocacy may appear
poorly timed. Recent patterns of relatively limited engagement and
restraint in the Middle East and Eurasia have left Stephen Walt (2014)
questioning whether Barrack Obama is more realist than he is.
Neoconservative criticism of the Obama administration has met with
significant public backlash over issues ranging from their contribution
to the rise of the Islamic State to their historical support for Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) torture programmes. Yet, there are a number of
reasons why asserting the ascendency of realism in US security policy
may be premature. First, despite a notable curtailment of large-scale
interventions, the underlying expansionary dynamic of US national
security remains, a point continually challenged by realists (e.g.
Mearsheimer, 2011a; Walt, 2010). Second[, for those instances where
restraint is exercised in threat construction, such as in viewing a
near-nuclear Iran as manageable through disarmament diplomacy rather
than preventive war, it is not evident that realist advocacy plays a
significant role]{.underline}. The reluctance of the public and the
foreign policy community to support further preventive war may be
attributable to a correction not in the underlying marketplace of ideas,
but in the shifting distribution of cultural resources. Collective
memories over the fallout of past preventive wars (e.g. the 2003 Iraq
War) may generate anxieties over reckless military interventions,
feelings that are likely to fall by the wayside if not sustained through
discursive or institutionalized practice. Finally, it is worth noting
that neoconservatives are not the only interlocutors that realists
engage with. As Mearsheimer (2011a: 19, 30) notes, 'liberal
imperialists' are among the central agents of threat inflation and are
highly influential in US foreign policy. Indeed, practices of liberal
humanitarian intervention often reflect a very particular kind of
securitizing move (Watson, 2011). Looking forward, this article has
sought to demonstrate that [tackling the challenges of advocacy cannot
be done within the narrow confines of contemporary US neorealism alone.
A re-engagement with the broader field of security studies is required
lest neorealism become 'diverted into a prolix and self-indulgent
discourse that is divorced from the real world']{.underline} (Walt,
1991: 223), especially concerning the practical problem of the
broadening of security. Yet, instead of making a trite call to scholarly
openness and engagement, 504 European Journal of International Relations
22(3) it may be more fitting to close with a comment regarding the
oracle of neorealism, Kenneth Waltz. In one of his last academic
pursuits, Waltz attended a conference on the 'Politics of
Securitization' at Copenhagen University in 2010.22 The event was a
stocktaking exercise on almost 20 years of securitization research. It
would be crude to suggest that Waltz's attendance reflects an eleventh
hour disregard for neorealism in favour of securitization theory. His
participation, however, can be interpreted as an act of engagement borne
out of curiosity and interest in roads less travelled in the discipline,
an act that we can all hope to emulate.

### Prolif Real 

#### The risk of nuclear prolif is REAL and higher than ever, says president of the Nuclear Threat Initiative. Prolif is the largest existential threat we have ever known.

Threat Initiative. Here, she is interviewed by NPR's Ari Shapiro. "The
Status Of Nuclear Weapons Around The World", NPR, February 28, 2019,

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Were surrounded by reminders that North Korea is not
the only nuclear threat. In Russia, Moscow says it\'s developing a
hypersonic missile that will someday be able to get past American
defenses. India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers, claim to have shot
down each other\'s fighter jets. It\'s their most serious confrontation
in years. To assess how dangerous this moment is, we\'re joined now by
Joan [Rohlfing]{.underline}. She worked on nonproliferation in the
Clinton administration, and she\'s now [president of the Nuclear Threat
Initiative]{.underline}. Welcome to the studio. JOAN ROHLFING: Thank
you - pleasure to be here. SHAPIRO: How many countries today could
actually use nuclear weapons if they wanted to? ROHLFING: So there are
[currently nine nuclear weapon state]{.underline}s that have the
capacity to use nuclear weapons today. There\'s the so-called permanent
five of the U.N. Security Council - [U.S., Russia, China, France, U.K.
And then]{.underline} in the category of newer, more recent nuclear
weapon states, we have [India, Pakistan, Israel, North
Korea.]{.underline} SHAPIRO: And when you look at the state of the world
on Thursday, February 28, what do you see as the brightest danger spot?
ROHLFING: So [there are several brightest danger spots]{.underline}. I
wish I could say there was only one danger spot. And as we\'ve seen so
much media focus on [North Korea]{.underline}, I would say we\'re
missing the broader picture. And two danger spots are the
[U.S.-Russia]{.underline} relationship as well as [India and
Pakistan]{.underline}. SHAPIRO: Well, let\'s talk about the U.S.-Russia
relationship. These countries have by far the largest stockpiles of
nuclear weapons, and the relationship between these two countries seems
to be near a low point. Why is this right near the top of your list of
concerns right now? ROHLFING: So the [U.S. and Russia have significant
arsenals on high alert, ready to go at a moment\'s notice against a
backdrop of a lot of friction and deteriorating relationship across a
range of fronts]{.underline} - over Ukraine, over Crimea, over Syria.
There are many ways in which you could imagine an accident or a
miscalculation happening. There are [dangerous military incidents that
**are happening with**]{.underline} some **[regularity]{.underline}**,
planes coming in close contact with each other. And for decades, we were
engaged in ongoing negotiations to manage the nuclear threat. Five years
ago, that effectively fell apart. And [for the first time in 50 years,
we have]{.underline} not [been]{.underline} talking about how we manage
this relationship and are potentially [allowing the guardrails, the
treaties that restrain nuclear weapons, to crater. So it\'s a very
troubling moment]{.underline}. SHAPIRO: You mentioned [the risk of an
accident or a miscalculation.]{.underline} How worried are you about
that as opposed to nuclear-armed countries deciding to go to war with
each other? ROHLFING: I worry about both. One of the complications is
[there are new technologies that make the nuclear threat more
complex]{.underline}. So think about the emergence of cyberattacks,
cyber vulnerabilities. The Defense Department in 2013 issued a report
that essentially said - and I\'m paraphrasing - there are no military
systems that are immune from the threats of cyberattack and cyber
vulnerabilities. SHAPIRO: And so a hacker could conceivably make it look
as though a nuclear attack was imminent or actually stage one. ROHLFING:
Indeed. Imagine if our command and control system were compromised so it
looked like there was a significant incoming attack and it prompted us
to react by retaliating with nuclear missiles or vice versa. SHAPIRO: So
when you put the danger of this moment in the context of the last 50
years, how worried are you right now? ROHLFING: [I\'m very worried. I
would say this is the most dangerous period since the Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.underline}, the current period. **[The risk is that
high]{.underline}**. And it\'s interesting. [As we see so much focus on
North Korea, this is a much broader threat**. It\'s an urgent threat**.
And it\'s **the biggest existential threat** that most people have never
heard of.]{.underline} SHAPIRO: What needs to change to move things in a
more positive direction? ROHLFING: I would say number one, we\'ve got to
get back to the negotiating table in particular with Russia. Other
states on a regional basis need to do this as well, notably India and
Pakistan. We have to talk to each other to figure out how we manage to
prevent nuclear crises. SHAPIRO: Joan Rohlfing, president of the Nuclear
Threat Initiative, thanks so much for coming in today. ROHLFING: Thank
you

#### The only way to stop prolif is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Any disagreeing theories fail to take into account that states do not always act rationally

[The nuclear optimists\' view that the spread of nuclear weapons will
produce stable deterrence is based on a rationalist assumption that new
proliferators\' behavior will reflect their interest in avoiding nuclear
war:]{.underline} new nuclear powers will avoid preventive nuclear wars,
develop survivable nuclear ar senals, and prevent nuclear weapons
accidents because it is in their obvious national interests to do so. I
have argued, in contrast, that [the actual behavior of new proliferators
will be strongly influenced by the powerful military organizations
within those states and that the common biases, rigid routines, and
parochial interests of these military organizations will lead to
deterrence failures and uses of nuclear weapons despite national
interests to the contrary]{.underline}. The concepts behind this more
pessimistic vision of proliferation are well-grounded in the rich
theoretical and empirical literature on complex organizations. My theory
makes less heroic assumptions about the rationality of states. It
provides useful insights into U.S. nuclear history during the Cold War
and points to key civilian interventions as a critical factor in
creating requirements of nuclear deterrence during the long peace.
Although the jury of history is still out on the consequences of further
nuclear proliferation, and will be for some time, the emerging evidence
from the proliferating world unfortunately supports this more
pessimistic view. assuming that all nuclear states will behave quite
rationally and will therefore take all the necessary steps to fulfill
the requirements of deterrence, Waltz and other [nuclear proliferation
optimists have confused prescriptions of what rational states should do
with predictions of what real states will do.]{.underline} This is an
error which the classical American realists rarely committed: Hans
Morgenthau and George Kennan believed that states should follow the
logic of balance of power politics, but their whole enterprise was
animated by a fear that the United States would fail to do so.1\"\' This
is also an error which Waltz avoided in Theory of International
Politics, where he noted that \"the theory requires no assumptions of
rationality . .. the theory says simply that if some do relatively well,
others will emulate them or fall by the wayside.\"\'112 Adding this
element of natural selection to his theory of international rela tions
put less of a burden on extreme rationality assumptions. My approach is
consistent with this vision[. Many proliferators may well behave
sensibly, but some will not and will then \"fall by the wayside.\"
Falling by the wayside, however, means in this case using nuclear
weapons and thus has very serious implications for the whole
international system]{.underline}. \"Realist theory by itself can handle
some, but not all the problems that concern us,\" Waltz correctly noted
in 1986. \"Just as market theory at times requires a theory of the firm,
so international-political theory at times needs a theory of the state.
\"113 Understanding the consequences of nuclear prolif eration is
precisely such a case. To predict the nuclear future, we need to utilize
ideas, building upon the theory of the firm, about how and when common
organizational behaviors can constrain rational reactions to the nu
clear revolution. If this analysis is correct, there is a great need for
more research and writing at the organizational level of analysis in
international relations. This approach was strongly represented in the
1970s, when Graham Allison, John Steinbruner, and Morton Halperin made
their seminal contributions. With the exceptions of studies of nuclear
command and control114 and weapons procurement,115 however, the field
languished in the 1980s and the study of international relations became
dominated by neorealist structural theorizing. Indeed, perhaps the most
influential book utilizing organization theory in security studies in
the mid-1980s, Barry Posen\'s Sources of Military Doctrine, was at least
in part a critique of organizational-level analyses, arguing that
neorealist \"balance of power theory is a slightly more powerful tool
than organization theory for the study of doctrine\" in Britain, France,
and Germany between the wars.116 In the 1990s, however, a new wave of
scholarship has used and contributed to organization theory in an effort
to understand major problems of inter national security. 117 Yet many
important questions remain unanswered. What is the eventual effect of
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on civil-military
relations in new states that acquire such technologies? Can military
organizations in the developing world learn vicariously from the
experience of other professional militaries, or will they have to learn
from their own successes and mistakes? Under what conditions will
military or ganizations accept downsizing, preferring to maintain their
\"essence\" with smaller forces on traditional missions; and under what
conditions will they actively seek out new non-traditional missions,
such as peace-keeping, di saster relief, and international drug control,
in order to enhance their size and power in a new security environment?
What is the impact of organiza tional rigidities and interests within
the state on the diffusion of international norms concerning the
acquisition and use of highly destructive weapons? Theoretical and
empirical research on such organizational level issues will be critical
to understanding international security in the post-Cold War world. What
are the policy implications of a more organizational approach to nuclear
proliferation? First, and most obviously, this approach suggests that
the United States is quite correct to maintain an active nuclear
non-proliferation policy. [**A world with more nuclear-armed states may
be our fate, but it should not be our goal**. It is highly unfortunate,
in this regard, that a growing number of defense analysts in proliferant
nations read the arguments of the U.S. nuclear optimists and now cite
that literature to legitimize the devel opment of nuclear arsenals in
their nations.]{.underline}118 It is fortunate, however, that U.S.
government officials have not been convinced of the merits of the
optimists\' views, and there is little evidence that U.S. policy is
going to move away from its strong opposition to the further spread of
nuclear weapons. Second, a more effective approach to nuclear
proliferation would add a larger dose of intellectual persuasion to our
current policy efforts, which are aimed primarily at restricting the
supply of materials and providing security guarantees to potential
proliferators.

### Tech = Prolif 

#### New technology increases the risk of proliferation, now more than ever. Although the neg tries to turn this thinking on its head, it is clear that proliferation means danger.

Proliferation risk and the need for non- proliferation. The dual purpose
of nuclear technology has been briefly mentioned, with the technologies
required for nuclear weapons programs existing at both the front and
back ends of the nuclear fuel cycle. Nuclear reactors themselves are not
directly a proliferation concern; rather the enriching and reprocessing
technologies can be directed away from civilian purposes and used for
weapons programs17 . As mentioned, reactor fuel consists of uranium
enriched to about 3-4% U-235; weapons grade uranium requires over 90%
and anything over 20% is referred to as highly enriched uranium (HEU).
Plutonium (Pu-239) can also be used for the production of nuclear
weapons if enriched to 93%; spent fuel contains typically 60-70% Pu-239.
Reprocessing technology allows enrichment of nuclear fuel, and although
the technology required to reach weapons grade exceeds that for normal
reprocessing, it is undoubtedly similar technology. Furthermore, [as
more nations acquire enrichment and reprocessing technology]{.underline}
[the verification of fissile material becomes more
difficult]{.underline}. Similarly [as more countries acquire more
facilities the resources of the IAEA are stretched further and further,
complicating the job of the watchdog]{.underline}. Put bluntly: \[T\]he
nuclear renaissance provides two additional challenges to the already
shaky non-proliferation regime: [as the use of existing civilian nuclear
technology increases, so does the **risk of** its diversion and
**weaponisation**; and the adoption of new technologies such as spent
fuel recycling and fast (breeder) reactors provide **new potential
sources of proliferation**]{.underline} (Ebinger and Massy, 2010 p85).
The need for non-proliferation is generally accepted. [Though some have
turned this line of thinking on its head]{.underline}18 , the general
consensus is that **[the less these weapons spread, the safer the world
will be]{.underline}** -- and vice versa.

### K2 Responsiveness 

#### The US must listen and respond to threats in order to preserve global liberal order. The US ignoring threats and retreating will lead to a collapse of liberal order.

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, members of the Committee, thank you
very much for inviting me to testify this morning. Since the end of the
Second World War, [American foreign policy has aimed at defending and
extending a liberal world order that conforms to American interests and
principles]{.underline}. It has done so not as a favor to others but
based on the hard-won understanding that [in the absence of such a world
order, both American interests and our cherished principles will
eventually be imperiled. This was the lesson that those]{.underline} who
were "present at the creation" of the American-led world [order learned
70 years ago, after two world wars and the rise of fascism and
totalitarian communism.]{.underline} **[If we are not vigilant, we will
have to learn that lesson all over again, and perhaps at even greater
cost.]{.underline}** Author Robert Kagan Stephen & Barbara Friedman
Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Project on International Order and
Strategy It has become common to say that the last 25-30 years of
American foreign policy have been a failure. This betrays both a lack of
historical memory and a lack of imagination. Which 25-year period of the
last century would we rather have: the first 25 years of the 20th
century, which gave us World War One, the breakdown of British-dominated
world order, the Bolshevik revolution, and the birth of fascism? The
second 25 years, which gave us the rise of Hitler and Stalin and
Imperial Japan, World War Two, the communist revolution in China, and
the imprisonment of half of Europe behind the Iron Curtain? The thirty
years between 1950 and 1980, which despite the extraordinary success of
the United States in establishing the secure basis of what used to be
called the free world and which eventually produced the liberal world
order we today enjoy, nevertheless also gave us the Korean War, the
Vietnam War, three major wars in the Middle East, the Arab oil embargo,
the Iranian Revolution, and the Iran hostage crisis? [The fact is that
for all the difficulties of the past 25-30 years, for all the errors, of
which there have been many---because this is the real world in which
failure is more common than success---for all the costs in lives and
treasure, this period has been by any reasonable historical measure one
of remarkable success.]{.underline} From the 1980s onward, we saw the
fall of Soviet communism and the Soviet empire, the liberation of
central and eastern Europe, the spread of democracy in Asia and Latin
America, a global prosperity unmatched in human history, and, very
importantly, no conflict between the great powers. Throughout much of
this period, in crises in the Balkans and in the Middle East, the United
States and its allies have operated effectively to stem humanitarian
disasters and put an end to brewing conflicts. Democratic government has
spread throughout Asia and Latin America, regions which were dominated
by dictatorships in previous decades. Despite the economic downturn
following the 2008 financial crisis, this is has been a period of
extraordinary prosperity by historical standards. These past 25-30 years
have also provided us a clear formula for success, a formula inherited
from those early years after World War Two. By building and maintaining
strong alliances with democratic nations and by supporting an open
global economy that allows those nations to prosper, and which lifts
billions of others in developing nations out of poverty, the United
States can best protect its own security and the well-being of its own
people. One need only think of the strong democratic alliances
maintained during the 1980s, the relationships between Ronald Reagan and
close allies like Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand,
and Yasuhiro Nakasone. Those bonds, together with a strong U.S. military
and strong U.S. economy, prevailed in the Cold War, convinced Soviet
leaders to concede peacefully, and established this extraordinary period
in the history of international relations. [It has not been perfect,
because perfection in human affairs is not possible. But by any
reasonable standard, this formula has been successful]{.underline}---and
successful for the American people. [It created a world order conducive
to American interests and American values.]{.underline} Related Protect
the Party: China's growing influence in the developing world 1958: When
America first went to war in the Middle East How can international law
regulate autonomous weapons? Today that order faces severe challenges,
both from without and from within. The external challenges are obvious
enough. Since 9/11 we have faced the threat of radical Islamic
terrorism, which has proved resilient and to which we have responded
inadequately. Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon, and to spread
its influence by military means throughout the Middle East and Persian
Gulf, have helped destabilize a region that remains strategically
relevant despite the declining American reliance on its oil. North
Korea's nuclear capabilities as well its ballistic missile capacities
are growing. Today, however, I would like to focus on what I believe to
be the greatest threats that we are going to face in the years and
decades, and those are threats posed by China and Russia. For while the
other threats I have mentioned pose serious challenges, and in the case
of terrorism obviously require the utmost vigilance, only these two
great powers have the capacity to upend the world order which has long
provided for Americans' security and well-being. The unmistakable
hegemonic ambitions of China and Russia threaten the stability and
security of the world's two most important regions, East Asia and
Europe. These regions are vital to the United States both economically
and strategically. They are the regions where two world wars originated
in the first half of the 20th century and would be the locus of the next
great war should the United States fail to play the role it has played
over the past 70 years in undergirding their security and stability. The
simple fact is, the era of great-power rivalries has returned. In the
past these great-power competitions have led invariably to great-power
wars. [Managing these rivalries, avoiding war, and doing so without
abandoning the liberal world order in the misguided belief that we will
be spared when it collapses, is the greatest challenge we face today and
in the years and decades to come. The simple fact is, the era of
great-power rivalries has returned. In the past these great-power
competitions have led invariably to great-power wars.]{.underline} Both
China and Russia have much in common. Both are classic revisionist
powers. Although both China and Russia have never enjoyed greater
security from foreign attack than they do today---Russia has never been
more secure from attack by its traditional enemies to the west, and
China has never been more secure from attack by its traditional enemy in
the east---both are dissatisfied with the current configuration of power
in the world. Both seek to restore a hegemonic dominance in their
regions that they enjoyed in the past. For China that means dominance of
East Asia, with nations like Japan, South Korea, and the nations of
Southeast Asia both acknowledging Chinese hegemony and acting in
conformity with China's strategic, economic, and political preferences.
For Russia, it means hegemonic influence in the areas of Central and
Eastern Europe which Russia has traditionally regarded as either part of
its empire or part of its sphere of influence. Both seek to redress what
they regard as an unfair distribution of power, influence, and honor in
the American-led postwar global order. Being autocracies, both feel
threatened by the dominant democratic powers in the international system
and by the democracies on their borders. Both regard the United States
as the principal obstacle to their ambitions, and therefore both seek to
weaken the American-led international security order which stands in the
way of their achieving what they regard as their rightful destinies. The
two great powers differ, so far, chiefly in their methods. China has
until now been the more careful and cautious, seeking influence
primarily through its great economic clout in the region and globally,
and using its growing military power chiefly as a source of deterrence
and intimidation. It has not resorted to the outright use of force yet,
although its actions in the South China Sea are military in nature and
carry the risk of producing military conflict. China's willingness to
use force cannot be ruled out in the future, and possibly in the near
future. Revisionist great powers with growing military capabilities
invariably make use of those capabilities when they believe the possible
gains outweigh the risks and costs. If the Chinese perceive America's
commitment to its allies and its position in the region to be weakening,
or its capacity to make good on those commitments to be declining, then
they will be more inclined to attempt to use the power they are
acquiring in order to achieve their objectives. Russia, on the other
hand, has already been far more aggressive. It has invaded two
neighboring states---Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014---and in both
cases has hived off significant portions of those two nations' sovereign
territory. It has also projected military force into Syria, lending its
military support to the Syrian regime's efforts to crush all opposition,
including by the aerial bombing and massacre of civilian populations.
Russia has also been aggressive in other ways. It has wielded its
control of European energy resources as a weapon. It has used
cyberwarfare against neighboring states. It has engaged in extensive
information warfare on a global scale. And it has interfered directly in
Western electoral processes, both to try to influence their outcomes and
more generally to discredit the democratic system. This past year,
Russia for the first time employed this powerful weapon against the
United States, heavily interfering in the American electoral process
with as yet unknown consequences. Although Russia, by any measure, is
the weaker of the two great powers, it has so far had more success than
China in accomplishing its objective of dividing and disrupting the
West. Its interference in Western democratic political systems, its
information warfare, and perhaps most importantly, its role in creating
increased refugee flows from Syria into Europe have all contributed to
the sapping of Europeans' confidence in their political systems and
their established political parties. Its military intervention in Syria,
contrasted with American passivity, has exacerbated already existing
doubts about American staying power in the region. China, until
recently, has succeeded mostly in driving American allies closer to the
United States out of concern for growing Chinese power. That could
change quickly, however, and especially if the United States continues
on its present trajectory. [We could soon face a situation where both
great revisionist powers are acting aggressively, including by military
means, which would pose an extreme challenge to American and global
security. The return of this great-power challenge has come just at the
moment when American and Western will, confidence, and capacity to meet
the challenge have been in decline.]{.underline} The present
administration has emphasized global retrenchment at the expense of
engagement and although its stated policy has aimed to "rebalance"
American foreign policy, the overall effect of its statements and
actions has been to raise doubts around the world about America's
staying power as the critical supporter of the present global order. Its
early attempt to "reset" relations with Russia was a first blow to
America's reputation as a reliable ally, partly because it came just
after the Russian invasion of Georgia and thus appeared to be almost a
reward for Russian aggression; partly because the "reset" came at the
expense of planned programs of military cooperation with Poland and the
Czech Republic that were jettisoned to appease Moscow; and partly
because this effort at appeasement came just as Russian policy toward
the West, and Vladimir Putin's repressive policies toward the Russian
people, were hardening. Then in 2014, the West's collective response to
the Russian invasion of Ukraine and seizure of Crimea, though better
than the Bush administration's response to the invasion of
Georgia---Europe and the United States at least imposed sanctions after
the invasion of Ukraine---still indicated reluctance on the part of the
U.S. administration to challenge Russia in what the American President
regarded as Russia's own sphere of interest. [In Syria, the present
administration practically invited Russian intervention, if only through
American passivity, and certainly did nothing to discourage it, thus
reinforcing the already prevalent impression of an America in retreat in
that region (an impression initially created by the unnecessary and
unwise withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq).]{.underline}
Subsequent Russian actions which increased the refugee flow from Syria
into Europe also brought no American response, despite the evident
damage of those refugee flows to European democratic institutions. The
overall impression given by the present administration has been that
none of this is America's problem. Related Books The Deer and the Dragon

Trade in an Interdependent World Economy By Robert D. Anderson, Nuno
Pires De Carvalho, and Antony Taubman 2018 In East Asia this
administration's otherwise commendable efforts to assert America's
continuing interest and influence have been undermined by a failure to
follow through with policies to support the rhetoric. The military
component of the so-called "Pivot" has been hollow due to inadequate
defense spending which has made it impossible to enhance the American
military presence in a meaningful way. The important economic component
of the pivot, meanwhile, represented most prominently by the
Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, was undermined this year when both
leading presidential candidates announced their opposition to the
agreement. [The general perception of American global retreat and
retrenchment, encouraged both by presidential rhetoric and by
administration policies, especially in the Middle East, has also been
noticed in Asia, where allies are left wondering how reliable the U.S.
commitment may be when facing the challenge posed by China, for
instance, in the continuing conflict over the South and East China Seas.
The perceived weakness and withdrawal of the United States as a result
of the present administration's policies and rhetoric has unfortunately
been greatly exacerbated by the comments of the president-elect and his
proxies during this year's campaign.]{.underline} Suggestions that the
United States might not come to the defense of NATO allies if attacked
by Russia, that it is not worth going to war over a country that is "in
the suburbs of St. Petersburg," that it is a "real problem" that the
United States has to come to Japan's defense if it is attacked, and in
general that the United States should fulfill its security commitments
to other nations only if it makes economic sense---**[all these have
only increased doubts about America's reliability as an ally and
partner.\[]{.underline}**1\]

## Politics Reps Good

### Pomo Refies Post-Truth 

#### Post-truth philosophers [reify]{.underline} the very structures they seek to [dismantle]{.underline} by [removing checks]{.underline} on [presidential jokes]{.underline} 

**Read,** PhD, **16** (Rupert Read, An academic and a Green Party

[Rorty was deeply worried]{.underline} by the widespread but in his view
fundamentally-mistaken [equation betwee]{.underline}n the [questioning
of traditional philosophy's 'quest for certainty']{.underline} on the
one hand [and the assumption of a truly 'post-truth' politics on the
other.]{.underline} For Rorty, [raising philosophical questions about
theories of truth]{.underline} (which he did, as did Derrida or
Baudrillard or Lyotard) **[by no means equated to putting a
question-mark in front of ordinary politics altogether]{.underline}**
(and on this point Rorty was antagonistic to most of the followers of
these French thinkers). Our whole culture and civilisation has features
which probabilify a tendency toward a notion that we live in
'post-truth' times. [Chief among these is consumerism]{.underline},
[which makes it seem as though one's opinions are one's
own;]{.underline} that one can 'buy' whatever subjective truth one
wants. [The problem with postmodernism is arguably that it **legitimates
this kind of tendency**, **rather than challenging it.**]{.underline}
But [Rorty would probably **distinguish between being**]{.underline}
**'**post-Truth' [**-** **post-metaphysical-theories-of-truth** - **and
being 'post-truth'** - post-truth altogether]{.underline}. He would
approve of the former (like the French apostles of post-modernism) but
disapprove of the latter. He once remarked to me that it was fine even
to call the Correspondence Theory of Truth
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth ) - the
classic boldest metaphysical theory of Truth - true... provided that one
recognised that all one was then doing was praising an un-cash-able
metaphor. [He thought that]{.underline}, really, [philosophical
'theories' were in most cases just metaphors pretending that they were
more than 'mere' metaphors.]{.underline} Rorty was all in favour of
being 'post-Truth', but solidly against being 'post-truth'. That's the
crucial difference between him on the one hand and the relativist or
subjectivist philosophies of our time (and Donald Trump) on the other.
[Rorty believed that the need for real social reform, for the tackling
of inequality, and for the reining in of out-of-control financial etc.
elites was not in the least undermined by giving up on excessively
ambitious philosophical aims.]{.underline} He thought that the
Enlightenment was on balance a philosophical failure - but that it was a
political success that badly needed defending. In other words: he
thought that [the philosophies of Kant and the other philosophical
'heroes' of the Enlightenment]{.underline} over-reached,
[posit]{.underline}ing [a kind of knowledge of Reality that was
unattainable]{.underline} or absurd - but that the political values that
emerged from these philosophies (of defending civil liberties, of
resisting arbitrary religious authority, and of democracy), ought to be
of enduring importance. I studied with Rorty at the School of Criticism
and Theory at Dartmouth, in the summer of 1992. Most of those in the
class with me (a mix of professors and grad students) were not
philosophers; most were from Literature Departments. The atmosphere in
the class was often not at all pleasant; only a handful of us were
interested in defending or even constructive criticism of Rorty's ideas.
And some defence they needed: because most of those in the class were
extremely hostile to Rorty's defence of anything like the traditional
Left, and to his deep questioning of where the obsession with cultural
politics was leading the English-speaking world. I remember one incident
particularly vividly. One of the students (a young, smart Literary
Theory Prof) quizzed Rorty about his attitude to Judith Butler's
(brilliantly clever) work (which we were studying in the class) on
gender and 'performativity'. Didn't he (Rorty) think that it was of
value for academics to bring out the radical potential of undermining
traditional norms as to the nature of gender? Rorty responded thus, with
a strong sense of irony and a hangdog look: "Yes; perhaps you are right;
perhaps in the current state of our society the most effective
subversive thing a male professor can do in the classroom is: once in a
while to wear a dress." What Rorty meant was: if this is true, then it
reflects somewhat badly on us and on the potential of our profession and
of our culture more generally. For what would be missing from a society
where that was the acme of radicalism was a sense of what needed
critiquing and changing in that society that would speak to the needs of
the ordinary mass of people coping with the aftermath of 12 years of
Republican cuts, of extreme levels of economic inequality, and so forth.
Yes; critiquing the idea of gender itself and exploring gender\'s
performative aspects is a valuable thing to do[. But the quest to be
ever-more \'subversive\' in this way misses the real radicalism: which
would be (for example) changing our intellectual and practical
priorities in such a way that the ideas of (for example) a Bernie
Sanders got taken much more seriously\...because he got put into the
Oval Office\...]{.underline} A question of real interest and importance
to the general public, now, is: how do we remain solid about politics,
true to sentiments on the doorstep, true to a basic sense of our
inhabiting a shared reality, serious about changing the world for the
better (or at least: stopping it from uncontrollably sliding into a
worse and worse situation, vis a vis politics, democracy, inequality,
climate, and more)... how do we do all this in a culture where we are
more than ever suspicious that what we are told may be untrue, and more
than ever suspicious about what it means for something to be true. Rorty
offers a possible way forward, vis a vis this crucial question. I once
asked Dick Rorty whether he would contemplate going into electoral
politics himself. [He answered strongly in the negative. It wasn't his
role at all, it wasn't his forte, he said to me. His role was that of
the public intellectual, trying to get people who were willing to think
about politics to think about how the aim of politics needed to
change,]{.underline} and how it needed to stay the same. Perhaps if
there had been just a little more such thinking, the 'Free World'
wouldn't now be 'led' by a man whose 'post-truth' rantings should make
some postmodernists more than a little ashamed of themselves.

### Democracy/Truth-Finding Good

#### Rejecting [truth entirely]{.underline} is a [perverse interpretation]{.underline} of post-truth theory -- upholding [democracy]{.underline} is our best shot at [staying on our toes]{.underline}

[The most surprising long-term effect of communicative abundance and the
spread of post-truth is arguably their reinforcement of the modern
questioning and rejection of arrogant beliefs in truth.]{.underline}
**[The possibility that post-truth politics is party to the "farewell to
truth" is poorly understood]{.underline}**, especially by critics of
post-truth, who invariably rally to the cause of what they casually call
truth. [Although the term is usually left undefined, their attachment to
truth helps explain why many academics, journalists and public
commentators typically accuse the "postmodernism" of recent decades of
being the unwitting accomplice or active foot servant of post-truth
politics.]{.underline} They are convinced that the "relativism" of the
postmodernists unhelpfully adds to the confusion surrounding "truth"
based on "evidence" and "facts". What is now urgently needed, they say,
is the recovery of truth. But what is truth? Truth is the antidote to
post-truth, they reply. It is observable. Truth is saying or writing or
visualising, somehow depicting things that correspond to "reality". The
champions of truth understood as adequation sometimes cite the
Polish-American mathematician Alfred Tarski, who famously put things
this way: the proposition that "snow is white" ("p") is true if and only
if snow is white ("p is true if and only if p"). It's seeing language as
a conveyor belt, as a medium for recording a "reality" that is external
to the observer. Tough versions of the orthodoxy insist that evidence is
evidence, reality is real and "brute facts" exist independently of
anyone's attitude toward them. It's not only philosophers who speak in
this fashion. Journalists, lawyers, more than a few academics, plenty of
environmental activists and data scientists are in the truth trade.
Believers in truth, a word that is usually left undefined, they have a
habit of supposing that reality is all around them, out there, within
arm's reach or just beyond arm's length, graspable and catchable through
redescription, for instance in the form of data. [Such conceptions of
"objectivity" fail to rethink the whole idea of truth as a necessary
condition of ridding the world of post-truth decadence.]{.underline}
Their [failure to cast doubt simultaneously upon both post-truth and
truth, to see them as partners rather than as opponents, ignores the
need for a new geography and history of truth]{.underline}. Truth varies
through space and time The geography of truth highlights the spatial
dimensions of truth-seeking and attempts to live the truth. What counts
as truth varies from place to place. The French Renaissance writer
Montaigne famously said that what is truth on one side of the Pyrenees
is falsehood on the other side. Foucault repeats the point in his
account of the birth of truth-telling (le dire vrai) within clinics and
prisons. Scholarly studies of the way cities (Escuela de Salamanca,
Chicago School of Economics, Copenhagen School) have shaped what counts
as knowledge push in the same direction. The geography of truth equally
matters within any given society, at any given time. The Pitjantjatjara
peoples of central Australia still today use a family of terms like mula
and mula-mulani and mulapa to refer to a "true story" that is inscribed
with both connotations of "a long time" and calls for agreement between
story tellers and listeners. When Pitjantjatjara peoples speak of truth,
they understand they are engaged in efforts to convince others of the
rightness of their tradition. They recognise what mainstream white
society usually forgets: that truth and trust are twins. [A new
geography of truth would also note that there are spaces of life that
either have little or nothing to do with truth]{.underline}, or where
references to truth are simply out of place (Bertolt Brecht once
remarked that if someone stood up in front of a group of strikers and
said 2+2=4 they would no doubt be jeered), or where telling the truth
has dangerous consequences, as when a Rohingya father lies to a Myanmar
army patrol hunting women to rape by telling them on his doorstep he has
no daughters[. What counts as truth varies not only through space but
also through time. Truth has a controversial history; truth has never
straightforwardly been truth.]{.underline} **[There is a history of
truth that shows that what counts as truth varies through time, but also
(the corollary) that what is today taken as truth has not always been
so.]{.underline}** Ancient Greek understandings of truth as aletheia, a
difficult word variously translated as "disclosure" or
"un-concealedness", are evidently different than Christian
understandings of "the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6) and
the imperative to tell the truth, shame the devil. The early modern
European period was marked by bitter struggles over the meaning of
religious "truth", calls for religious toleration and the deployment, by
believers in truth, of such tactics of deception as occultism, the
Catholic doctrine of mental reservation and Protestant casuistry. The
public controversies about truth among Christians encompassed Luther's
explosive, influential attack on popery as the sole interpreter of
scripture in An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German
Nation Concerning the Reform of the Christian Estate (1520). They
extended to Lessing's recommendation that we should thank God that we
don't know the truth ("Sage jeder, was ihm Wahrheit dünkt, und die
Wahrheit selbst sei Gott empfohlen" \["Let each person say what s/he
deems truth, and let truth itself be commended unto God"\]); and
Tocqueville's observation that the modern democratic revolution
powerfully calls into question so-called public truths about the
"natural" inferiority of slaves and women. [Democracy doubts both
post-truth and 'the truth' The public sense that truth claims are
contestable and mutable interpretations is undoubtedly bolstered by the
multi-media communications revolution, and by the advent of new forms of
monitory democracy featuring a plethora of mediated platforms where
power is publicly interrogated and chastened**. Monitory democracy
promotes the growth of public spaces where uncertainty, doubt,
scepticism, irony and modesty in the face of arbitrary power are
nurtured.**]{.underline} Wittgenstein's recommendation that saying "I
know" should be banned so that people would be required to say "I
believe I know" makes good sense under these conditions. [We could say
that post-truth politics is the dark and messy side of an unfinished
quantum shift in support of the pluralisation of people's lived
perceptions of the world. **Yes, talk of truth is not disappearing, or
dead**]{.underline}. Just as unbelievers continue to say "Lord help us"
and "Jesus Christ", and despite Copernicus people still speak of the
setting sun, so the language of truth lives on in people's lives. [Yet
nowadays tropes like "We hold these truths to be self-evident" arouse
public suspicions. The truth is out that truth has many faces. What
counts as "truthful information" is less and less understood by wise
citizens as "hard facts" or as indisputable "evidence" or as chunks of
"reality" to be mined from television and radio programs, or from
newspapers, digital platforms and "expert" authorities. In the age of
communicative abundance and monitory democracy, "reality" is multiple
and mutable. "Reality", including the lies and buffoonery and other
forms of gaslighting peddled by the powerful, comes to be understood as
always "reported reality", as "reality" produced by some for others --
in other words, as **messages that are shaped and reshaped and reshaped
again in the process of transmission and reception.**]{.underline}
**[This disenchantment of truth has everything to do with
democracy.]{.underline}** Considered as a universal norm liberated from
metaphysical foundations, as a whole way of life committed to the
defence of complex equality, freedom and difference, democracy in
monitory form is the guardian of a plurality of lived interpretations of
life. The radical originality of monitory democracy is its defiant
insistence that peoples' lives are never simply given, that all things
human are built on the shifting sands of space-time, and that no person
or group, no matter how much "truth" or power they presently enjoy or
want to claim, can be trusted permanently, in any given context, to
govern other people's lives. [Democracy is thus the best human weapon so
far invented for guarding against the "illusions of certainty" and
breaking up truth-camouflaged monopolies of power]{.underline}, wherever
they operate[. Democracy is not a True and Right norm. Just the reverse:
the norm of monitory democracy is aware of its own and others' limits,
knows that it doesn't know everything, and understands that democracy
has no meta-historical guarantees**. That is why it does not suffer
truth-telling dogmatists and fools gladly. Democracy is a living
reminder that truths are never self-evident, and that what counts as
truth is a matter of interpretation.**]{.underline} Recognising that in
political life "truth has a despotic character", democracy stands for a
world beyond truth and post-truth. This is not because all women and men
are "naturally" created equal. Rather, it's because democracy supposes
that no man or woman is good enough to claim they know the truth and to
rule permanently over their fellows and the earthly habitats in which
they dwell.

[Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election]{.underline}, as well as the UK's decision to leave the
European Union through "Brexit," [rattled public confidence in
polls.]{.underline} Since these two major world events occurred, [we
have been asked the same question]{.underline} when giving
presentations, on social media, in interviews, and from our own friends
and neighbors: "[Can we still trust polls?"]{.underline} Our new video
explains why well-designed polls can be trusted. **[Those who felt led
astray by surveys conducted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election
may be surprised to learn that national polling was generally quite
accurate]{.underline}**. [National pre-election polls in 2016 indicated
that Hillary Clinton would win the national popular vote by a 3-point
margin, and in fact she won by 2 points]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
major [problem was with state-level polls]{.underline}, [many of which
missed a late swing to Trump among undecided voters and did not correct
for the fact that their responding samples contained proportionally too
many college-educated voters]{.underline} (who were more likely to favor
Clinton). A silver lining is that [both of these problems can be
overcome]{.underline}, to some extent, **[by more rigorous survey
weighting and heightened attention to the possibility of late shifts in
voter preferences.]{.underline}** It's also important to remember that
[election polls are just one kind of poll, and that they're not the best
barometer]{.underline} for the accuracy of polling in general. Why not?
Because an election poll has an extra hurdle to jump: [It not only has
to measure public opinion, it also has to predict which of the people
interviewed are going to vote and how they will vote]{.underline} -- a
notoriously difficult task. So, if election polls aren't a reliable
measure of polling accuracy, what is? [There are a number of other ways
we can measure]{.underline} the [health of polling]{.underline}. [One is
to look at]{.underline} how polling on an issue tracks with real-world
events. For example, on [the issue of same-sex marriage]{.underline} in
the United States[, polls showed growing acceptance around the same time
that advocates were winning statewide referenda legalizing
it.]{.underline} The polls, in other words, were corroborated by
real-world events. There are also a number of high-quality,
government-funded surveys that provide us with quite accurate benchmark
estimates for a range of characteristics of the U.S. population.
Pollsters can ask the same questions these government surveys do to see
how their results compare. [In the case of Pew Research Center polls,
our trends track very closely with those of high-quality benchmark polls
on questions like religious identity and political
affiliation]{.underline}. This gives us additional confidence that the
trends we're recording are accurate. **[So, yes, we can still trust
polls. But it's important to be realistic about the precision they can
provide.]{.underline}**

[Facts hold a sacred place in Western liberal democracies]{.underline}.
Whenever democracy seems to be going awry, when voters are manipulated
or politicians are ducking questions, we turn to facts for salvation.
But they seem to be losing their ability to support consensus.
PolitiFact has found that about 70 percent of Donald Trump's "factual"
statements actually fall into the categories of "mostly false," "false"
and "pants on fire" untruth. For the Brexit referendum, Leave argued
that European Union membership costs Britain 350 million pounds a week,
but failed to account for the money received in return. The sense is
widespread: We have entered an age of post-truth politics. As politics
becomes more adversarial and dominated by television performances, the
status of facts in public debate rises too high. We place expectations
on statistics and expert testimony that strains them to breaking point.
Rather than sit coolly outside the fray of political argument, facts are
now one of the main rhetorical weapons within it. How can we still be
speaking of "facts" when they no longer provide us with a reality that
we all agree on? The problem is that the experts and agencies involved
in producing facts have multiplied, and many are now for hire. If you
really want to find an expert willing to endorse a fact, and have
sufficient money or political clout behind you, you probably can. The
combination of populist movements with social media is often held
responsible for post-truth politics. Individuals have growing
opportunities to shape their media consumption around their own opinions
and prejudices, and populist leaders are ready to encourage them. But to
focus on recent, more egregious abuses of facts is to overlook the ways
in which the authority of facts has been in decline for quite some time.
Newspapers might provide resistance to the excesses of populist
demagogy, but not to the broader crisis of facts. The problem is the
oversupply of facts in the 21st century: There are too many sources, too
many methods, with varying levels of credibility, depending on who
funded a given study and how the eye-catching number was selected.
According to the cultural historian Mary Poovey, the tendency to
represent society in terms of facts first arose in late medieval times
with the birth of accounting. What was new about merchant bookkeeping,
Dr. Poovey argued, was that it presented a type of truth that could
apparently stand alone, without requiring any interpretation or faith on
the part of the person reading it. Editors' Picks When N.Y.C. Is Your
Gym: Meet the Athletes Redefining Fitness in the City's Parks I Wanted
to Know What White Men Thought About Their Privilege. So I Asked. In the
centuries that followed, accounting was joined by statistics, economics,
surveys and a range of other numerical methods. But even as these
methods expanded, they tended to be the preserve of small, tight-knit
institutions, academic societies and professional associations who could
uphold standards. National statistical associations, for example, soon
provided the know-how for official statistics offices, affiliated with
and funded by governments. In the 20th century, an industry for facts
emerged. Market-research companies began to conduct surveys in the 1920s
and extended into opinion polling in the 1930s. Think tanks like the
American Enterprise Institute were established during and after World
War II to apply statistics and economics to the design of new government
policies, typically in the service of one political agenda or another.
The idea of "evidence-based policy," popular among liberal politicians
in the late 1990s and early 2000s, saw economics being heavily leaned on
to justify government programs, in an allegedly post-ideological age. Of
course the term "fact" isn't reserved exclusively for numbers. But it
does imply a type of knowledge that can be reliably parceled out in
public, without constant need for verification or interpretation. Yet
there is one much more radical contributor to our post-truth politics
that could ultimately be as transformative of our society as accounting
proved to be 500 years ago. [We are in the middle of a transition from a
society of facts to a society of data. During this interim, confusion
abounds surrounding the exact status of knowledge and numbers in public
life, exacerbating the sense that truth itself is being
abandoned]{.underline}. The place to start in understanding this
transition is with the spread of "smart" technologies into everyday
life, sometimes called the "internet of things." Thanks to the presence
of smartphones and smartcards in our pockets, the dramatic uptake of
social media, the rise of e-commerce as a means of purchasing goods and
services, and the spread of sensory devices across public spaces, we
leave a vast quantity of data in our wake as we go about our daily
activities. [Numbers are being generated much faster than we have any
specific use for. But they can nevertheless be mined to get a sense of
how people are behaving and what they are thinking**. The promise of
facts is to settle arguments between warring perspectives and simplify
the issues at stake.**]{.underline} [For instance, politicians might
disagree over the right economic policy, but if they can agree that "the
economy has grown by 2 percent" and "unemployment is 5 percent," then
there is at least a shared stable reality that they can argue
over]{.underline}. [**The promise of data, by contrast, is to sense
shifts in public sentiment.** By analyzing Twitter using algorithms, for
example, it is possible to get virtually real-time updates on how a
given politician is perceived. This is what's known as "sentiment
analysis."]{.underline} There are precedents for this, such as the
"worm" that monitors live audience reaction during a televised
presidential debate, rising and falling in response to each moment of a
candidate's rhetoric. Financial markets represent the sentiments of
traders as they fluctuate throughout the day. Stock markets never
produce a fact as to what Cisco is worth in the way that an accountant
can; they provide a window into how thousands of people around the world
are feeling about Cisco, from one minute to the next. [Journalists and
politicians can no more ignore a constant audit of collective mood than
C.E.O.s can ignore the fluctuations in their companies' share
prices]{.underline}. If the British government had spent more time
trying to track public sentiment toward the European Union and less time
repeating the facts of how the British economy benefited from membership
in the union, it might have fought the Brexit referendum campaign
differently and more successfully. [Dominic Cummings, one of the leading
pro-Brexit campaigners, mocked what he called outdated polling
techniques. He also asked one pollster to add a question on
"enthusiasm," and, employing scientists to mine very large,
up-to-the-minute data sets, to gauge voter mood and to react accordingly
with ads and voter-turnout volunteers**. It is possible to live in a
world of data but no facts**]{.underline}**.** Think of how we employ
weather forecasts: We understand that it is not a fact that it will be
75 degrees on Thursday, and that figure will fluctuate all the time.
[Weather forecasting works in a similar way to sentiment analysis,
bringing data from a wide range of sensory devices, and converting this
into a constantly evolving narrative about the near future.]{.underline}
However, this produces some chilling possibilities for politics. [Once
numbers are viewed more as indicators of current sentiment, rather than
as statements about reality, how are we to achieve any consensus on the
nature of social, economic and environmental problems, never mind agree
on the solutions? **Conspiracy theories prosper under such
conditions**]{.underline}. And while we will have far greater means of
knowing how many people believe those theories, we will have far fewer
means of persuading them to abandon them.

[Can we trust the polls? Under the best of circumstances, the answer is
\"Not necessarily]{.underline} without a fair amount of detailed
information about how they were conducted.\" [This general note of
caution applies at any time to any poll consumer]{.underline}. But
today, with polls proliferating in the media and with methodological
concerns increasing within the polling industry, caution is even more
warranted. [This is not to suggest that the general quality of polling
data is declining or that the problems facing pollsters have no
answers]{.underline}. Still, [consumers]{.underline} of polling data
[need to be more careful than ever.]{.underline} Proliferating Polls In
a period of rapidly advancing technology and falling costs for
computers, long-distance telephone service, and statistical software, it
is easier than ever for start-up companies to get into the polling
business. Because most polling now takes place on the telephone, it is
cheap and easy for someone who wants to get into the polling business to
buy a sample, write a short questionnaire for a Computer Assisted
Telephone Interviewing (CATI) application, buy interviewing services
from a field house, and receive a report based on the marginals for each
question and a limited set of cross-tabulations. As a consequence, [the
opportunity to see the results of a poorly conducted poll has become
more frequent, even if we can't assess exactly whether the probability
of seeing one has changed. **The problem is exacerbated because
journalists and others who report on public opinion are not generally
well trained in assessing poll results and thus cannot always weed out
\"bad\" poll results before they enter the news stream and become
\"fact**.\"]{.underline} So the risk is growing that local polls on
national or local issues may be less well conducted or less well
reported than those conducted by major national organizations. Related

evaluate polls on the basis of the standards of disclosure of poll
results adopted by organizations like the American Association for
Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and the National Council of Public Polls
(NCPP).]{.underline} And they should report any concerns they have about
such items. Information thus made available on details such as sampling,
question wording, field dates, and response rates is useful for the few
informed poll consumers who can interpret it. Declining Response Rates
Author M Michael W. Traugott [Falling response rates are a concern for
the entire survey research industry,]{.underline} whether academic
researchers, political consultants who work for candidates, or news
organizations. Recent compilations of response rates in telephone
surveys by the Council for Marketing and Opinion Research suggest that
studies with short field periods are now averaging about 10 percent,
although most media polls have response rates in the 30-45 percent
range. [Although analysts have identified many factors behind this
long-term trend---such as the negative impacts of telemarketers posing
as pollsters and the increased use of various call-screening
devices---we don't yet understand well how much each contributes to the
overall decline.]{.underline} Researchers are also beginning to
understand that declining participation rates probably affect different
kinds of political polls in different ways. [For preelection polls that
project the outcome of a race, preliminary research suggests that the
same factors that may lower participation in surveys may also lower
participation in elections]{.underline}**. [Declining response rates
thus do not seem to pose dangers to the accuracy of estimates of the
outcome of recent presidential elections.]{.underline}** More research
will help clarify whether declining participation will affect
preelection estimates in lower-turnout elections held in nonpresidential
years or whether over time it will have different effects on future
preelection estimates. Preelection polls are unusual in that their
accuracy can be checked against the outcome of the election itself.
(That characteristic may create a misplaced confidence in polling
generally, since similar external validations do not apply in many other
polling situations.) When it comes to polling on issues of general
government policy, we do not know the potential impact of declining
survey participation rates because we have no way to check the accuracy
of the polls. For example, when polls assess the public's response to or
appraisal of policies such as military action in Iraq or a proposed tax
cut, there is no equivalent independent way to measure the validity of
the measurements. There is, however, some suggestion that policy polling
results may reflect more conservative or Republican views than are
present in the population as a whole---a bias that would not be
surprising because Republicans have long been known to be more likely to
vote than Democrats (a fact accounted for in the likelihood estimators
used by most polling firms). Emerging Technology [Many polling
organizations embrace new technology as a way to cut costs and speed
data collection.]{.underline} Some new technologies also make it
possible to collect more types of data. Web-based surveys, for example,
can employ visual or audio stimuli that are not possible with other
questionnaire designs, making them an excellent way to evaluate
political commercials, especially when applied in a full experimental
design. Many organizations have also turned to Web-based surveys to
reduce the turnaround time between the design of a questionnaire and the
start of data analysis and production of a first report of results.
[Applied inappropriately, however, this technology offers several
potential pitfalls for data quality.]{.underline} [First and foremost
are sampling issues related to respondent selection. Pollsters obtain
respondents in three ways.]{.underline} They take \"volunteers\" who
self-select themselves to answer generally available questionnaires on a
Web site. They recruit volunteers, sometimes for a single survey and
sometimes for a panel from which subsequent samples will be drawn. And
they use a probability sample to select respondents on the telephone and
supply Internet access to those who need it. Because the availability of
Web connections is not uniformly or randomly distributed in society, the
existence of a "digital divide" can introduce one source of bias in
volunteer samples. [This technique,]{.underline} for example, [tends to
produce samples that are more Republican and with more conservative
leanings, as we have seen in such varied circumstances as post-debate
polls in 2000]{.underline} and more general public policy assessments
since. The resulting bias tends to favor the current Bush administration
and could work against a Democratic administration. [Other possible
problems include fatigue]{.underline} from the requirement to respond to
periodic and frequent surveys to maintain panel status---a requirement
that could even lead, in some circumstances, to "professional"
respondents. **[More research needs to be done on these issues, but at a
minimum a poll consumer ought to know about respondent recruitment and
selection for Web-based surveys]{.underline}**. Pollsters must also
contend with the rise of cell phones. Despite the increasing penetration
of these devices in the United States (approaching 75 percent), fewer
than 5 percent of Americans rely solely on a cell phone. But that share
is growing---and presenting pollsters with a new set of problems. First,
cell phone exchanges have no general directory, and they are excluded
from samples that most public polling firms can buy. Second, people who
rely on cell phones are more mobile than the rest of the population, and
many use phones provided by their business. If, as is likely, the
geographical correspondence between the phones' assigned area codes and
their owners' place of residence is poor, it may or may not be an issue
for firms conducting surveys with national samples, but it could be for
those conducting state or local surveys and effectively dialing out of
their target area. One further problem linked to new technology is
telephone caller ID. This screening device, which alerts households to
who is calling, makes it possible to avoid calls from "out of their
area" or from unfamiliar numbers. In response to citizens' pleas for
protection from telemarketers, the federal government is moving to
develop a "do not call" list[. Pollsters need not honor such list
membership now, but future abuses by pollsters or telemarketers could
change that. This technology too is exerting downward pressure on
response rates.]{.underline} New Voting Methods and Preelection
Pollsters Preelection pollsters face two relatively new problems, both
of which they can manage by devoting more financial resources to their
work. Whether firms will be willing to pay more to collect data with
less error or bias remains to be seen. For almost 10 years, new
administrative procedures have been allowing Americans to change the way
they cast their ballots. Increasingly, citizens are voting before
election day---or rather, as it is coming to mean, "Vote Counting Day."
Through procedures such as "early voting" (where machines are set up in
convenient locations such as malls or shopping centers as early as three
weeks before election day), voting by mail (where every registered voter
is sent a ballot up to 20 days before election day), and permanent
absentee registration (where voters can ask to be mailed a ballot in
advance of election day without indicating that they will be out of
town), more and more voters are casting ballots early. In the 2000
election, about one-sixth of the national electorate voted early, and
the share is growing. In selected states, the proportion can be much
greater. This trend is also facilitated by other administrative changes,
such as election day registration, whereby citizens can decide at the
last minute that they want to vote, even if they have not previously
registered[. These developments do not mean that preelection telephone
polls are outmoded or will fade away. They do suggest that telephone
pollsters will have to use hybrid designs that include different
screening questions]{.underline} (Have you voted yet? Are you registered
to vote in the upcoming election?). Voter News Service used such
techniques in past elections, as did firms in large states---such as
California, Texas, and Florida---with many early voters. Eventually
telephone polls may be supplemented by exit polls of voters leaving
early voting sites. Such problems are not insurmountable, but they imply
added expense as well as the need for more sophisticated designs, which
will likely complicate modeling the outcome of elections based on more
and more disparate data sources. A second issue for preelection
pollsters---one that cropped up in the 2002 election---is the
development by the Republican Party of 24-Hour Task Forces to counter
union-based get-out-the-vote campaigns. Volunteer recruits were
solicited on the Internet to make at least three calls in the final 72
hours of the campaign to encourage likely Republican voters to get to
the polls. The effectiveness of these efforts has not been analyzed
systematically, but they may have been of use in at least some states,
especially in the South[. The difficulty is that preelection
pollsters]{.underline}, especially those linked to newspapers,
[traditionally poll up through Friday or Saturday to produce a story for
Sunday's paper. Because their polling typically ends just as these
mobilization efforts get under way, their polls could underestimate the
Republican share of the vote]{.underline}. [Pollsters could counter the
problem by extending the period for preelection polling, even through
Monday evening, but that would defy a set of news-making norms about the
best time to publish stories about the campaign to reach the largest
audience]{.underline}. And it also would increase data collection costs.
Exit Pollsters Exit polls serve two distinct functions: they provide
information on who won the election, and they explain that success. Exit
polling was developed as a technique to intercept individual voters as
they left the polls in samples of precincts. Since the late 1960s, exit
polling has given electronic media a big edge in election coverage,
including the ability to produce news about outcomes long before all
votes have been counted. **[But the information collected and analyzed
by exit pollsters is useful not only for projecting races but also for
analyzing voter intent and behavior by attitudinal characteristics as
well as a full set of demographic factor]{.underline}**s. Much work
remains before the news media are prepared to use exit polling to
analyze voting in the 2004 presidential election. The work is crucial,
for the exit polls---in their explanatory function, not their predictive
one---have become an independent voice of the public in explaining what
happened and why. **[Without that voice, journalists and political
commentators will revert to the old style of political reporting,
relying on party officials and strategists to provide the causal links
and explanations for why one party or candidate succeeded over
another]{.underline}**. During the past two elections, the Voter News
Service exit poll operation was dogged by two problems. Each was
identified as part of the post-2000 reviews both internally and in
congressional testimony, and neither is yet solved. The first was
whether the administrative software and hardware that had been
supporting VNS (still a DOS-based system for a mainframe computer) were
up to the task. The second, one that still has not received much
discussion, was whether the statistical modeling of the VNS system was
adequate. For the VNS projections were based not only on exit poll
interviews, but also on statistical modeling that incorporated a
detailed history for each precinct, including information on turnout and
partisan division of the vote over time; prior estimates of the outcome
of each race, based on intelligence that included preelection polls and
a variety of expert assessments; and, in very close races, raw vote
totals. Although these models were conceptually appropriate, they did
not use the very latest statistical theories and models, as does, for
example, Britain's BBC. Soon after election day 2002, the networks began
another review, eventually deciding to disband VNS. In its place, they
have agreed to support a new exit poll operation, the National Elections
Pool (NEP), to be headed by Warren Mitofsky and Joe Lenski, two veterans
with both national and international experience. But more public
discussion is needed about whether to revise the statistical models for
the new operation. The task for Mitofsky and Lenski is not enviable. The
old VNS software system, whatever its current ownership and
availability, was not up to the task of handling large amounts of data
with current technology. And in 2002 VNS on its own was unable, even
with almost two years' notice, to develop a new system to produce
relatively few estimates for an off-year election. The coming
presidential caucuses and primaries give the new team less than a year
to develop another new system to produce a larger number of improved
estimates-though Mitofsky and Lenski were able to provide such a service
for CNN in 2002 for 10 states through their "RealVote" system. And
because the new team is likely to focus primarily on data collection and
processing, it will devote less time and effort to the estimation
models. Whatever happens, the new organization is still likely to
produce the only estimates of outcomes and explanations, and that too is
a problem. At least one other source should collect data independently
to produce another estimate of the outcomes. The other source should
also use a different questionnaire, in theory reflecting additional news
judgments about appropriate content. The two estimates together would
provide a fuller explanation and more reliable estimates of what
happened and why. The Internationalization of Polling The recent
military action in Iraq has increased news organizations' interest in
what foreign publics, especially those in the Middle East or in states
such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, think about the United States and its
policies. But the polling industry in these regions is not yet well
developed and typically relies on samples drawn from a few major urban
areas rather than countrywide. The National Council of Public Polls has
recently suggested that the issue may often be a pragmatic one for the
data collection firm. In addition to cutting travel costs, these simpler
designs may also reduce translation and language problems. But the
resulting data also require journalists wishing to report about what
others think of Americans to be careful about the level and type of
generalizations they draw. More Polls, More Problems Public opinion
polls, frequently conducted and with results that are widely
disseminated, are one distinguishing feature of a healthy democracy.
They provide a means for citizens to communicate with their elected
representatives, and vice versa. But their value in this regard depends
on the collection of high-quality data, well analyzed and appropriately
interpreted[. Of late there has been a step-function increase in the
availability of polls, accompanied by issues of potential reductions in
quality. Such developments are not unprecedented**: new technologies
have before, and will again, become available to produce data faster and
cheaper, while the resulting savings are not devoted to reducing various
kinds of error**]{.underline}**.** [No one yet fully understands what
the consequences might be of the various problems outlined above. Poll
consumers, as ever, have no recourse but to pay as much attention as
they can to where the data came from and how they were
analyzed.]{.underline}

of argument is morally troubling,]{.underline} since for a supporter of
immigration to accede to the threat of such a backlash
**[curtailment]{.underline}** in the formulation of immigration policy
is to allow this policy to be shaped by what he \[one\] regards as
morally disreputable (e.g., nativist or xenophobic) motives[. It also
seems to be a case of penalizing the]{.underline} (potential) [victims
of wrongfully exercised power,]{.underline} analogous to cases where one
is advised to move slowly in remedying past injustices. [If, however,
one holds that public policies ought to be guided by an \"ethic of
responsibility\", according to which all predictable
consequences]{.underline} (whatever their moral status) [are taken into
account]{.underline}, in order to achieve the best possible overall
results, **[then this kind of argument carries weight]{.underline}**,
and **[its validity depends upon the truth of its
predictions]{.underline}**. Surely the prudent course would be the right
course from the point of view of all future would-be immigrants, as
opposed to those currently seeking admission. [Concern to avoid a
backlash and the social tensions that might cause a backlash is of
course justifiable in terms of the national interest, and from this
point of view it might be a weighty consideration if these are genuine
threats.]{.underline}

This leads to my second case study, [alliance
relationships]{.underline}. In this area economists have addressed
several subtopics, including the division of labor within alliances or
\"burden sharing,\" [armaments cooperation, and the problem of
credibility of commitment]{.underline}. In what follows I use the
example of armaments cooperation in a way that enables an examination of
these other two issues of burden sharing and credibility as well. 63
Once again, it is useful to recall Hirshleifer\'s admonition that
game-theoretic models of international cooperation can lead to many
different outcomes, depending on the number of players and the game that
is played. In alliance theory, one game---the prisoner\'s dilemma---and
one outcome---free riding---have dominated much of the economics and
policy analysis. But even the PDG can produce different outcomes as the
number of parties is increased and assumptions about their motivations
are loosened or changed. In some models, for example, two weaker allies
may join to exploit a third, stronger ally. In others, the strong may
exploit the weak. Clearly, the richness of relations among the NATO
allies is not easily reducible to any single type of game, given the
presence of both domestic and international factors in shaping the
strategic interactions among the member states. Indeed, [a variety of
economic models have been used to address the alliance
relationship]{.underline}. Drawing on Hirshleifer\'s fundamental
insights with respect to resource allocation decisions, [nations must
choose between developing weapons domestically (\"arming\") and
importing defense equipment from friends and allies---or some
combination]{.underline} of the two. As James Morrow has written of
these choices, \"[Arming produces a more reliable improvement in
security\....Alliances produce additional security quickly but with less
reliability.]{.underline}\" 64 Whether to arm or import when it comes to
weapons procurement decisions presents an interesting puzzle for defense
economics. [Take the public goods approach to alliances]{.underline}, as
pioneered by Olson and Zeckhauser. Using the U.S. \[End Page 178\]
nuclear umbrella over Western Europe as their example, they assumed that
security was a single good, and that once this public good was produced
by the dominant member of an alliance, the smaller members would be able
to enjoy a free ride, spending little on their own defense. 65 Olson and
Zeckhauser\'s analysis was supported with data on defense spending among
NATO member states, which demonstrated the lopsided contribution made by
the United States [If this theory is accurate, however, why do the
allies spend any money at all on armaments]{.underline}? Recalling
Garfinkel\'s model of political economy, we know that from the purely
electoral standpoint of public officials, these funds could be used more
effectively for campaign purposes by investing in other public goods
such as schools, hospitals, and public pensions. Free riding should
always be the preferred strategy for decisionmakers in small states, but
it seems clear that most allies spend more on their defense than might
have been predicted by the public goods model. [A second influential
theory of alliance economics argues that allies should pursue free trade
as the basis of their procurement policies]{.underline}. Free trade
means that the allies should adopt a division of labor when it comes to
their security. As Sandler and Hartley have written, \"An optimal
alliance might\...be characterized by specialization based on
comparative advantage with the principle applied to both armed forces
and defense industries.\" 66 Scholars have argued that free trade would
bring in its train important benefits from a political, economic, and
security standpoint. Drawing on Albert Hirschman\'s fundamental insight
about the \"supply effects\" of trade, Joanne Gowa and Edward Mansfield
have emphasized that international commerce promotes \"security
externalities,\" meaning that the efficiency gains that come from trade
permit states to release more resources for defense than would otherwise
be possible; as a result, \"trade enhances the potential military power
of any country that engages in it.\" 67 For an alliance as a whole, free
trade would promote efficiency in weapons production, because each would
specialize in building what it does best. [The oft-expressed fear of
excessive dependence]{.underline} \[End Page 179\] [on a trading
partner, or of being abandoned]{.underline} (i.e., cut off) [during a
conflict, could be dealt with through such policies as the stockpiling
of weapons and **the diversification of arms imports**]{.underline},
issues that have also been addressed in recent years using economic
models. 68 Finally, from a political standpoint, [a NATO free trade
policy could help to strengthen alliance relationships]{.underline},
something that is sorely needed at a time when transatlantic tensions
seem to be running high. 69 According to Walt, U.S. officials, for
example, have asserted that **[\"increasing American arms transfers will
help \'revitalize American alliances.\'\"]{.underline}** 70 [Free trade
represents a political and economic signal that one ally can send to
another about the importance of their relationship. These benefits would
seem to argue strongly for a policy of free trade in weapons among
allies]{.underline}, and indeed that policy has its strong supporters in
certain quarters of the defense establishment. A 1999 study by a trio of
analysts at RAND asserted that \"the allies and the United States should
work toward open trade and investment in defense and information
technology\" so as to create a transatlantic market for promoting the
revolution in military affairs. 71 But that policy does not appear to
have much influence in the Pentagon or its alliance counterparts.
Instead, the allies maintain a whole series of import and export
controls that are targeted not just against third parties and President
George W. Bush\'s \"axis of evil,\" but against one another as well.
Both bureaucrats and members of Congress, for reasons not just of
national security but also domestic political economy, have supported
these controls as well. The Buy American Act of 1933, for example,
bolsters U.S. defense producers by giving them a cost advantage over
foreign firms in any Pentagon-sponsored procurement competition. In
fact, defense markets on both sides of the Atlantic remain protected
from competition by a web of formal and informal rules and regulations.
Why is that the case? David Lake draws on joint production or
transaction economics in seeking an answer in his book Entangling
Relations. 72 From his \[End Page 180\] perspective, advocates of free
trade miss out on something important when they focus their gaze too
narrowly on the efficiency gains that arise through adoption of the
division of labor. As a consequence, they fail to take into account the
costs that will also arise in free trade, for example with respect to
the monitoring and enforcement of agreements. In short, we return to the
problem of credibility of commitment. By way of illustration, imagine
that states A and B strike a free trade agreement, in which A
specializes in the production and export of guns and B of butter. While
adopting the division of labor delivers economic benefits to both sides,
A and B must also be confident that each country is sticking to its side
of the bargain, and that necessarily entails some monitoring costs. If A
continues to produce both guns and butter while B has gone ahead and
given up its guns, B may find itself in a vulnerable position (or left,
in game-theoretic terms, with a \"sucker\'s payoff\"); B will therefore
have an incentive to invest some of its gains from trade in monitoring
and enforcement technology (and similarly for A). Thus, [although
benefits certainly flow from adopting the division of labor, costs come
with ensuring that agreements are respected.]{.underline} It is, of
course, the role of institutions to structure arrangements that maximize
transaction benefits and minimize transaction costs. 73 In terms of
military relationships, Lake argues that [countries will weigh the costs
and benefits associated with defense alliances, cooperating to the point
where the costs (in economic, political, and security terms) outweigh
the benefits.]{.underline} This joint production model predicts that an
incomplete division of labor among security partners will emerge. The
division of labor is incomplete because [the costs of monitoring and
enforcing free trade will, at some point, outweigh the
benefits]{.underline}. Some joint production will occur, however,
because \"the cost of producing security can be enormous,\" and
countries \"may consume fewer resources by pooling efforts with
others.\" 74 Thus, even though the pressures generated by the
international system may make internal arming a country\'s preferred
acquisition strategy, the economic, political, and security costs of
autarky must not be overlooked or underestimated. Arming diverts
resources away from other societal goods, such as education, health
care, and infrastructure, which voters may prefer. Economically,
protection of the defense-industrial sector is \[End Page 181\]
inefficient and costly. Finally, in security terms, the choice for
internal arming may simply result in the production of poorer weapons
systems and less battlefield capability than imported systems would
deliver. The view of transaction or joint production economics,
therefore, creates the expectation that military allies will adopt some
mix of arming and import- ing.Further, in pursuing even a limited
division of labor, they will create institutions that will act to
maximize economic and security benefits while minimizing monitoring and
enforcement costs. By sharing information and decisionmaking authority,
for example, and by engaging in armaments cooperation, institutions such
as NATO may contribute to the \"locking-in\" of security commitments by
the member states. These initiatives are designed to promote the
credibility of commitment among states that is required if alliances are
to play a role in promoting the democratic peace. As these cases
demonstrate, economic models and methods have been used to address a
diverse set of issues in modern security studies, helping scholars to
sharpen arguments and to raise new and important questions with respect
to international conflict and defense policy. These models and methods
are hardly monolithic; economists disagree vehemently among themselves
over basic assumptions and modeling decisions, and that has also driven
developments in the field. Hirshleifer\'s work---alongside that of other
economists who pioneered the use of this body of theory to military
problems, notably Thomas Schelling and Mancur Olson---has animated much
of that contemporary literature, by introducing approaches to security
problems that have proved amenable to a progressive research agenda.
Still, much work remains to be done.

#### The arms trade can be explained by economic concepts like maximum utility

**Kapstein, Paul Dubrule Professor of Economics and Political Science,

Second, there has been little attention paid in the recent literature to
the economics of arms control agreements. To be sure, economists after
the Cold War did some work on conversion and the peace dividend, but
less on arms control agreements per se. [Arms control and disarmament
decisions would]{.underline}, prima facie, [fit nicely into the sorts of
models]{.underline} that Hirshleifer has [developed with respect to
resource allocation decisions]{.underline} and that have since been
extended by other scholars. The work of David Lake on the monitoring
costs associated with international agreements is relevant here as well.
Bringing these various approaches together to enhance academic
understanding of why states enter into arms control agreements has the
potential of bearing fruit, and again could complement scholarship in
this area that has focused, for example, on norms and the role of
epistemic communities. 77 [What role do economic calculations play in
arms control?]{.underline} Can a weapons agreement be usefully
conceptualized as a carrot given by a wealthier state to a poorer
one---a wealth-sharing device---in the hope of enhancing the rich
country\'s national security? These are questions that economists have
not yet tackled to any great extent. Third, with few exceptions,
[economists have not devoted much attention to the arms
trade]{.underline}. 78 As Paul Levine and Ron Smith put it, \"The arms
trade is interesting because **[it is where foreign policy concerns such
as security, human rights, and international order interact most
directly with economic concerns such as trade, jobs, and
profits]{.underline}**.\" 79 Within the political science literature in
security studies, [the arms trade]{.underline} has been a topic of some
importance since the Nixon Doctrine of the late 1960s, much of it
critical of U.S. policy, but this work has benefited little from
economic analysis. 80 \[End Page 184\] Indeed, the existing literature
[has hardly begun to settle the most basic debates]{.underline}. In a
recent study, for example, William Keller and Janne Nolan have asserted
that \"the motivations behind arms sales have become largely economic.\"
81 Yet in his classic study of the defense trade, Andrew Pierre says the
opposite: \"Arms sales must be seen, essentially, in political terms.\"
82 Surely, Levine and Smith are correct when they state, [\"Explanations
of the \[arms\] trade that emphasize just economics or just politics
must be unsatisfactory: both matter.\"]{.underline} 83 The problem,
then, is to model both the domestic interaction between economics and
politics, on the one hand, and the international or strategic
interactions among states between more arms sales or less, on the other.
As the reader can appreciate, the sorts of models discussed in this
essay are relevant to this set of issues. In recent work by Levine and
Smith, for example, governments set their defense expenditures and arms
sales in order to maintain the military production capacity that
optimizes a given domestic welfare function. 84 Consistent with the
security dilemma, however, [arming by one state increases military
expenditure by another, and so both states spend more on defense than
they would like.]{.underline} [Arms control agreements]{.underline},
including limits on overseas arms sales, would solve this collective
action problem by **[establishing an arrangement such that each side
maximizes its utility]{.underline}**, or its welfare- maximizing
combination of domestic and military production. But the two parties are
trapped inside a prisoner\'s dilemma game, from which they can be
liberated only if they find instruments designed to enhance their mutual
credibility of commitment or of treaty enforcement. This simple
discussion suggests the way forward for a progressive research agenda on
the arms trade and on arms control more generally. Because monitoring
and enforcement problems are so central to these sets of issues---and to
many others in security studies as well (and indeed, to very different
problems of international relations, such as enforcing global climate
change agreements) 85 ---theoretical breakthroughs in this area could
have wide-reaching effects for academic research. Economists motivated
by the commitment problem \[End Page 185\] might do well to examine the
arms trade and arms control, in so doing contributing both to security
studies and to topics of broader academic and public concern.

#### Don't buy their moral claims -- you can't be held morally responsible for failing to prevent an inevitable atrocity

Fischer and Ravizza, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the
University of California at Riverside and Associate Professor at Yale,
91 -- (John Martin and Mark, "Responsibility and Inevitability," The
University of Chicago, Ethics, Vol. 101, No. 2 (Jan., 1991), pp.
258-278, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2381863>) /ncp-AW

We believe that a different asymmetry thesis is true. This is the thesis
that [whereas an agent can be morally responsible for doing something
which he cannot avoid doing, no agent can be morally responsible for
failing to do something which he cannot do]{.underline}. That is. an
asymmetry exists between actions and omissions with respect to the
requirement of alternative possibilities.\' We have already presented
cases of moral responsibility for actions in which the agent could not
have done otherwise. so let us consider whether we could construct
parallel cases involving omissions. Consider, first, \"Sloth,\" which is
similar in some respects to \"Hero.\" In \"Sloth,\" \_\]ohn is walking
along a beach and he sees a child struggling in the water. john believes
that he could save the child with very little effort, but he is
disinclined to expend any energy to help anyone else. He decides not to
try to save the child and he continues to walk along the beach. 15 john
morally responsible for failing to save the child? Unbeknownst to john,
the child was about to drown when \_\]ohn glimpsed him and the child
drowned one second afterjohn decided not to jum p into the water. The
facts of the case exert pressure to say that john is not morally
responsible for failing to save the child: after all, the child would
have drowned even if john had tried to save it. john could not have
saved the child. John may well be morally responsible for deciding not
to try to save the child and even for not trying to save the child, but
he is not morally responsible for not saving the child. \"Sloth\" is no
different in this respect from a case exactly like it except that the
child would not have drowned immediately; rather, a patrol of sharks
which (unbeknownst to john) infested the water between the beach and the
struggling child would have eaten him had hejumped in. Imagine,
similarly, that Sue thinks that she can end a terrible drought by doing
a rain dance. Of course, Sue is deluded and she does not, in fact, have
the power to affect the weather. Suppose also that there are no clouds
in sight (and no clouds within hundreds of miles); atmospheric
conditions imply that it will not, in fact, rain for weeks. Now, Sue
happens to hate the local farmers and she would like to hurt them in any
way possible. While falsely believing that she could easily end the
drought immediately, she deliberately refrains from doing her rain
dance.\' Is Sue morally responsible for failing to cause it to rain
(i.e., for not ending the drought) in \"Rain Dance\"? Again, there is
pressure to say that whereas Sue might be morally responsible for not
doing the rain dance and for not trying to end the drought, she is not
morally responsible for not ending the drought. After all, Sue could not
have ended the drought. The cases presented above are cases in which an
agent omits to do something good. [We now turn to a similar case in
which an agent omits to do something bad.]{.underline} just as good and
bad actions are symmetrical with respect to the lack of a requirement of
alternative possibilities (for moral responsibility), **[omitting to
perform a good action and omitting to perform a bad action are
symmetrical with respect to the requirement of alternative
possibilities]{.underline}**. [Imagine that you are a small-time thug
strolling along a dimly lit street in a deserted pan of
town]{.underline}. Suddenly you spy a shiny, new Mercedes with a flat
tire stranded by the side of the road. The driver of the car is a
well-dressed, elderly gentleman with a bulging billfold in his breast
pocket. [You are tempted to hurry over to the car, assault the old man,
and steal his money. Fortunately, you decide against this]{.underline}
and you continue along your way. **[Are you morally responsible for
failing to rob the driver?]{.underline}** Well, un- beknownst to you
(and the driver of the car), the Mafia has put drugs into the trunk of
the car. Five mafioso thugs are watching the car from five other cars in
the neighborhood. They have strict instructions: if anyone threatens the
driver of the car, they are to shoot him with their Uzis. In these
circumstances, we can safely imagine that if [you had at- tempted to rob
the driver, you would have been killed]{.underline}. **[We believe that
you are not morally responsible for failing to rob the driver. You
might. be morally responsible for deciding not to rob the driver, for
not deciding to rob the driver, and for not trying to rob the
driver.]{.underline}** [But there is strong pressure to say that you are
simply not morally responsible for not robbing the driver, and this
pressure comes from the fact that you could not rob the
driver]{.underline}. In \"Flat Tire,\" you are not morally responsible
for failing to do a bad thing which you could not do. These cases
suggest that an agent cannot be held morally responsible for not
performing an action which he cannot perform. Thus, these cases, in
conjunction with \"Assassin\" and \"Hero,\" suggest that actions and
omissions are asymmetrical with respect to the requirement of al-
ternative possibilities. [That is, moral responsibility for an action
does not require the freedom to refrain from performing the action,
whereas moral responsibility for failure to perform an action **requires
the freedom to perform the action.**]{.underline} We hold individuals
morally responsible not just for actions and omissions but also for
consequences of these actions (and omissions). We now wish to turn to
some cases of moral responsibility for consequences.

### AT Securitizing China Bad 

#### Even if China isn't revisionist in the squo, it has the [potential]{.underline} to reform the world in its image -- BRI proves

**Wilson, Shelby Cullom Davis Professor of Russian Studies and Professor
of Political Science at Wheaton College, Research Associate at the Davis
Center of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard, 6/11** -- (Jeanne L.,
"Are Russia and China revisionist states?" Asia Dialogue,
<https://theasiadialogue.com/2019/06/11/are-russia-and-china-revisionist-states/>)
/ncp-AW

In the past few years, [Russia and China have increasingly been referred
to as revisionist powers]{.underline}. For example, both the United
States' 2017 National Security Strategy and the United States' 2018
National Defence Strategy identify Russia and China as revisionist
states. The concept of revisionism encompasses various meanings that
typically [distinguish between states that accept the status quo
distribution of power in the international system and those which seek
to alter it to their advantage]{.underline}. Here, I am primarily
concerned with the extent to which Russia and China challenge the
implicit assumptions that underpin the norms and values of what might be
referred to as the international community in the English School sense
of the term. I argue that **[Russia and China are not revisionist but
rather neo-revisionist states. However, it is China rather than Russia
that is more likely substantively to challenge the status quo and assume
the position of a full-blown revisionist power in the
future.]{.underline}** Both Western analysts and policymakers have
identified [a litany of Russian and Chinese behaviour that indicates
nonconformance to what is portrayed as universal norms and
values]{.underline}. In fact, [Russia and China contest]{.underline} a
set of neoliberal practices that have evolved in the post-World War Two
international order. Foremost amongst these is [the evolution of human
rights as a universal value]{.underline} that legitimizes intervention
in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state (although Russia has made
use of the rhetoric of the "responsibility to protect" to justify its
activities in the post-Soviet space). Russia and China similarly view
the West's elevation of [liberal democracy]{.underline} as a universal
ideal as a subterfuge for the fomenting of Colour Revolutions that seek
regime change in noncompliant targeted states. [At the same time, Russia
and China accept and in fact continuously reaffirm their commitment to a
number of fundamental precepts of the international order.]{.underline}
These include the primacy of state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, the importance of international law, and the centrality of
the United Nations, particularly with respect to the key role of the
United Nations Security Council. It must be acknowledged that [Russian
and Chinese promotion of these concepts does not necessarily provide a
reliable guide to their foreign policy behaviour]{.underline} (although
the same criticism can be lodged against countless other states). Russia
and China also actively participate in aspects of global governance,
placing an emphasis on the United Nations as the ultimate source of
international authority. Both states have signed a number of United
Nations Conventions and Covenants including the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights. They are members of a number of
multilateral and regional structures (although Russia has been suspended
from participation in the G-7). The two states stress their commitment
to the maintenance of global and regional security supporting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the non-militarization of space,
and the need to fight terrorism. Critically, Russia and China act as
rule takers rather than challengers in their participation in the global
financial institutions. China, in particular, has emerged as a vocal
supporter of globalization and free trade in conspicuous contrast to the
United States in the Trump administration. Russia and China's view of
the operation of the international system conforms in a large part to
Westphalian precepts, while rejecting the West's more recent adoption of
humanitarian and individualistic norms and values (which in fact exist
in a state of uneasy tension with the traditional assumptions of the
Westphalian order). **[In this sense, Russia and China are
neo-revisionist rather than revisionist states.]{.underline}** Under the
Xi Jinping leadership, **[China has adopted a more assertive foreign
policy that]{.underline}**, in contrast to the behaviour of past
leadership, **[confidently asserts China's status as a great
power]{.underline}**. On the one hand, this is reflected in [the State's
efforts to readjust China's role in international structures, as seen in
the attempt to expand its decision-making power within the
I]{.underline}nternational [M]{.underline}onetary [F]{.underline}und.
This sort of behaviour, however, takes place within the boundaries of
the contemporary international community. On the other hand, [China's
launching of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013]{.underline} can
be viewed as **[offering an alternative vision of global governance that
challenges the approach promoted by the hegemonic Western
powers]{.underline}**. Beijing has offered a number of rationales for
BRI which are in themselves at least in part persuasive. This massive
infrastructure project can be seen as a means of developing China's
Western regions, utilizing surplus capital and providing employment,
extending Chinese export markets, and securing domestic energy supplies.
Generally speaking, [the Chinese leadership has sought to downplay the
strategic and geopolitical implications of BRI.]{.underline} In fact,
the BRI is closely associated with two rather amorphous concepts: the
"Community of Common Destiny" (minyun gongtongti) and the "Silk Road
Spirit" (silu Jingshen). The Community of Common Destiny relies on a
sort of updating of Confucianism (that is also reminiscent of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) to stress mutual benefit,
friendship, equality, and win-win outcomes. The Silk Road Spirit
provides a parallel emphasis on inclusivity that emphasizes the right of
all states to choose their own social systems, a pointed rejection of
the democracy and human rights agenda of the hegemonic West. [Although
the initial focus of BRI and the Community of Common Destiny is
regional, the long-term implications are global. The BRI and the
Community of Common Destiny **potentially posit a Sinocentric global
community that locates China at its epicentre.** Whereas Russia lacks
the material capabilities to propose an alternative framework to the
contemporary global system, such restrictions do not apply to
China]{.underline}. To be sure, the success of the [BRI]{.underline} is
by no means assured but the project [has multiple adverse implications
to the continued ability of the West to set the rules of discourse and
behaviour in the international community]{.underline}. The Western
response to a rising China has largely been an effort to socialize China
into the norms and values of the US-led international order. But [China
increasingly possesses the potential ability to remake the international
community in its own image. To do so would indicate China's true status
as a revisionist power.]{.underline}

### AT China = Threat 

#### China is not a threat and its rise is inevitable -- accounts for SCS conflict, Spratly Islands, economic conflicts, human rights violations, CCP

**Mahbubani, Singaporean academic and former Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, 19** -- (Kishore, "What China Threat?" Harper's
Magazine, <https://harpers.org/archive/2019/02/what-china-threat/>)
/ncp-AW

**[Within about fifteen years, China's economy will surpass America's
and become the largest in the world.]{.underline}** As this moment
approaches, meanwhile, [a consensus has formed in Washington that China
poses a significant threat to American interests and
well-­being]{.underline}. General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), has said that "China probably poses the
greatest threat to our nation by about 2025." The summary of America's
2018 National Defense Strategy [claims that China and Russia are
"revisionist powers"]{.underline} seeking to "shape a world consistent
with their authoritarian model---gaining veto authority over other
nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions." Christopher
Wray, the FBI director, has said, "One of the things we're trying to do
is view the China threat as not just a whole-­of-­government threat, but a
whole-­of-­society threat . . . and I think it's going to take a
whole-­of-­society response by us." [So widespread is this notion
that]{.underline} when Donald [Trump]{.underline} launched his [trade
war]{.underline} against China, in January 2018, he [received support
even from moderate figures]{.underline} such as Democratic senator Chuck
Schumer. Two main currents are driving these concerns. One is economic:
that China has undermined the US economy by pursuing unfair trade
practices, demanding technology transfers, stealing intellectual
property, and imposing non-­tariff barriers that impede access to Chinese
markets. The other current is political: that China's successful
economic development has not been accompanied by the liberal democratic
reform Western governments, and particularly the United States, had
expected; and that China has become too aggressive in its dealing with
other nations. Reading about the imminent threat American officials
believe China poses, it is not hard to see why Graham Allison, in his
book Destined for War, reaches the depressing conclusion that armed
conflict between the two countries is more likely than not. Yet [since
China is not mounting a military force to threaten or invade the United
States, not trying to intervene in America's domestic politics, and not
engaged in a deliberate campaign to destroy the American
economy,]{.underline} we must consider that, **[in spite of the
increasing clamor about the threat China poses to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[it is still possible
for America to find a way to deal peaceably with a China]{.underline}**
that will become the number one economic, and possibly geopolitical,
power within a decade---and to do so in a way that advances its own
interests, even as it constrains China's. [America must first reconsider
a long-­held belief about China's political system.]{.underline} Since
the collapse of the Soviet Union, American policymakers have been
[convinced that it would only be a matter of time before
the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party [(CCP) followed the Soviet
Communist Party into the political grave]{.underline}. Politicians and
policymakers on both ends of the political spectrum
[accepted]{.underline}, implicitly or explicitly, [the famous thesis of
Francis Fukuyama that there was only one historical road to
follow]{.underline}. W**[hat we may be witnessing is]{.underline}** not
just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of
postwar history, but **[the end of history as such]{.underline}**: that
is, [the end point of]{.underline} mankind's ideological evolution and
the universalization of [Western liberal democracy as the final form of
human government]{.underline}. When Bill Clinton explained in March 2000
why he supported China's admission to the World Trade Organization, he
stressed that political liberation would inevitably flow from economic
liberalization, concluding that "if you believe in a future of greater
openness and freedom for the people of China, you ought to be for this
agreement." His successor, George W. Bush, shared the same conviction.
In his 2002 National Security Strategy, he wrote, "In time, China will
find that social and political freedom is the only source of that
national greatness." Hillary Clinton was more explicit. According to
her, by persisting with Communist Party rule, the Chinese "are trying to
stop history, which is a fool's errand. They cannot do it. But they're
going to hold it off as long as possible." It is worth considering the
conviction of American policymakers that they could so confidently
dispense political prescriptions to China. No other empire, of course,
has accumulated as much economic, political, and military power as the
United States has. Yet, [it has still been less than 250 years since the
Declaration of Independence was signed]{.underline}, in 1776. **[China,
by contrast, is considerably older, and the Chinese people have learned
from several thousand years of history that they suffer most when the
central government is weak and divided,]{.underline}** as it was for
almost a century after the Opium War of 1842, when the country was
ravaged by foreign invasions, civil wars, famines, and much else
besides. Since 1978, however, **[China has lifted 800 million people out
of poverty and created the largest middle class in the
world]{.underline}**. As Graham Allison wrote in an op-­ed for China
Daily, an En­glish-­language newspaper owned by the Chinese government,
["it could be argued that 40 years of miracle growth have created a
greater increase in human well-­being for more individuals than occurred
in the previous more than 4,000 years of China's history."]{.underline}
**[All this has happened while the CCP has been in power.]{.underline}**
And the Chinese did not fail to notice that [the collapse of the Soviet
Communist party led to a decline in Russian life expectancy, increase in
infant mortality, and plummeting incomes]{.underline}. In American eyes,
the contest between America's and China's political systems is one
between a democracy, where the people freely choose their government and
enjoy freedom of speech and of religion, and an autocracy, where the
people have no such freedoms. To neutral observers, however, [it could
just as easily be seen as a choice between a plutocracy in the United
States, where major public policy decisions end up favoring the rich
over the masses, and a meritocracy in China, where major public policy
decisions made by officials chosen by Party elites on the basis of
ability and performance have resulted in such a striking alleviation of
poverty]{.underline}. One fact cannot be denied. **[In the past thirty
years, the median income of the American worker has not
improved]{.underline}**: between 1979 and 2013, median hourly wages rose
just 6 percent---less than 0.2 percent per year. This doesn't mean that
the Chinese political system should remain in its current form forever.
Human rights violations---such as the detention of hundreds of thousands
of Uighurs---remain a major concern. [Within China today, there are many
voices calling for reforms.]{.underline} Among them is the prominent
liberal scholar Xu Jilin. And in Rethinking China's Rise: A Liberal
Critique, David Ownby has produced an excellent En­glish translation of
eight essays Xu has written over the past decade. [Xu lodges his
sharpest criticisms against his fellow Chinese scholars, and especially
against what he sees as their excessive focus on the nation-­state and
insistence on China's essential cultural and historical difference from
Western political models.]{.underline} He argues that this overemphasis
on particularism in fact marks a departure from [traditional Chinese
culture]{.underline}, which, as exemplified by its historical tianxia
model of foreign relations, [was a universal and open
system]{.underline}. [Criticizing the blanket rejection]{.underline} by
"extreme nationalists" among his Chinese academic peers of "anything
created by Westerners," Xu argues instead that **[China has historically
succeeded because it was open]{.underline}**. However, **[not even a
liberal like Xu would call for China to replicate the American political
system.]{.underline}** Instead, he argues that China should "employ her
own cultural traditions," through promoting a "new tianxia": on the
domestic front, "Han people and the various national minorities will
enjoy mutual equality in legal and status terms, and the cultural
uniqueness and pluralism of the different nationalities will be
respected and protected," while its relations with other countries "will
be defined by the principles of respect for each other's sovereign
independence, equality in their treatment of each other, and peaceful
coexistence." **[China's political system will have to evolve with its
social and economic conditions. And, in many respects, it has evolved
significantly, becoming much more open than it once was.]{.underline}**
When I first went to China, in 1980, for instance, no Chinese were
allowed to travel overseas as private tourists. Last year, roughly 134
million traveled overseas. And roughly 134 million Chinese returned home
freely. Similarly, [millions of the best young Chinese minds have
experienced the academic freedom of American universities. Yet, in 2017,
eight in ten Chinese students chose to return home.]{.underline} Though
the question remains: If things have been going well, why is Xi imposing
tighter political discipline on Communist Party members and removing
term limits? His predecessor, Hu Jintao, delivered spectacular economic
growth. But this period was also marked by a spike in corruption and
party factionalism led by Bo Xilai, the Chongqing party secretary who
tried to challenge Xi's rise to power, and Zhou Yongkang, the powerful
domestic security chief under Xi's predecessor. Xi believed these trends
would delegitimize the CCP and end China's successful rejuvenation.
Against these dire challenges, he saw no realistic alternative to
reimposing strong central leadership. Despite doing this (or, because he
did this), Xi remains hugely popular. [Many in the West have been
alarmed by the enormous power Xi has accumulated]{.underline}, taking it
as a harbinger of armed conflict. Xi's accumulation of power,
**[however, has not fundamentally changed China's long-­term geopolitical
strategy]{.underline}**. The Chinese have, for instance, **[avoided
unnecessary wars]{.underline}**. Unlike the United States, which is
blessed with two nonthreatening neighbors in Canada and Mexico, China
has difficult relations with a number of strong, nationalistic
neighbors, including India, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. Quite
remarkably, **[of the five permanent members of the UN Security
Council]{.underline}** (China, France, Russia, the United States, and
the United Kingdom), **[China is the only one among them that has not
fired a single military shot across its border in thirty
years]{.underline}**, since a brief naval battle between China and
Vietnam in 1988. By contrast, even during the relatively peaceful Obama
Administration, the American military dropped twenty-six thousand bombs
on seven countries in a single year. Evidently, **[the Chinese
understand well the art of strategic restraint]{.underline}**. [There
have, of course, been moments when China seemed close to
war.]{.underline} Richard McGregor's book, Asia's Reckoning, which
focuses on the strategic relationship between the United States, China,
and Japan since the postwar period, vividly documents the precarious
moments between China and Japan since 2012. After Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshihiko Noda "nationalized" the disputed Senkaku Islands in
September 2012, Chinese and Japanese naval vessels came perilously close
to each other. Yet [while many seasoned observers predicted a military
clash between the two countries in 2014, none came to pass]{.underline}.
**[Much has been made of the possibility of conflict in the South China
Sea,]{.underline}** through which roughly one fifth of all global
shipping passes each year, and where the Chinese have converted isolated
reefs and shoals into military installations as part of larger,
contested claims to sovereignty over portions of the waters. **[But
contrary to Western analyses, China, while undeniably more politically
assertive in the region, has not become more aggressive
militarily.]{.underline}** [The smaller, rival claimants to sovereignty
in the South China Sea, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and
Vietnam, control a number of islands in the waters. China could easily
dislodge them. **It has not done so.**]{.underline} When considering the
familiar narrative of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, it must
be remembered that [the United States itself has missed opportunities to
defuse tensions there]{.underline}. A former US ambassador to China, J.
Stapleton Roy, told me that in a joint press conference with President
Obama on September 25, 2015, Xi Jinping not only proposed an approach to
the South China Sea that included the endorsement of declarations
supported by all ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, but, more significantly, added that **[China had no intention
of militarizing the Spratly Islands]{.underline}**, where it had engaged
in massive reclamation work on the reefs and shoals it occupied. [Yet
the Obama Administration made no effort to pursue China's reasonable
proposal. Instead, the US Navy stepped up its patrols.]{.underline} In
response, China increased the pace of its construction of defensive
installations on the islands. Just as [careful diplomacy is]{.underline}
required in military matters, it is also [integral to America's economic
relations with China]{.underline}. Virtually no well-­known mainstream
economist agrees with Trump, or his top trade adviser Peter Navarro and
trade representative Robert Lighthizer, that America's trade deficits
are the result of unfair practices by other countries. Martin Feldstein,
the former chairman of Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, has
pointed out that America's global trade deficit is due to the fact that
its consumption outweighs its domestic production. Imposing tariffs on
low-­cost Chinese goods will not rectify this structural feature, but
will serve only to make many essential goods less affordable to ordinary
Americans. Trump's trade war against China has nevertheless won him
broad mainstream support. This is a result of a major mistake that China
has made. It has ignored growing perceptions and complaints, including
by leading American figures, that China has been fundamentally unfair in
many of its economic policies. "The US has a strong case" against China
in "alleg\[ing\] that China persists with discriminatory policies that
favour local companies and penalise foreign firms," as George Magnus
notes in Red Flags, recommending that the United States engage China in
a dialogue to encourage the latter to open up "market access in
non-­politically sensitive commercial and service-­producing sectors"
through avenues such as the US--China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.
Magnus's suggestion of [dialogue through existing institutions is a far
wiser route for America to take than Trump's trade war]{.underline}. If
the Trump Administration were to focus its economic campaign against
China on the areas of these unfair practices, it would generate a great
deal of global support for this campaign. Indeed, the WTO provides many
avenues to do so. Conceivably, [China may also privately acknowledge
mistakes made in these areas and alter its policies]{.underline}.
However, there is a growing perception in China and beyond that the real
goal of the Trump Administration is not just to eliminate these unfair
trade practices but to undermine or thwart China's long-­term plan to
become a technological leader in its own right. Although the United
States has the right to implement policies to prevent the theft of its
technology, as Martin Feldstein has indicated, this should not be
conflated with its efforts to thwart China's long-­term, state-­led
industrial plan, Made in China 2025, designed to make China a global
competitor in advanced manufacturing, focusing on industries like
electric cars, advanced robotics, and artificial intelligence. Both
Feldstein and Magnus agree that in order to maintain supremacy in
high-­tech industries like aerospace and robotics, the US government,
rather than pursuing tariffs, should invest in areas such as higher
education and research and development. In short, America needs to
develop its own long-­term economic strategy to match that of China. In
both policy and rhetoric, it is clear to see that [China's leadership
has a vision for its economy and people]{.underline}. Plans like Made in
China 2025 and the infrastructure projects undertaken in the Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI), such as the construction of high-speed railways,
demonstrate [China's efforts to become a global competitor in new,
advanced industries]{.underline}. At the same time, China's leaders have
emphasized that **[the country can no longer pursue GDP growth at the
expense of social costs such as inequality and environmental
pollution.]{.underline}** This Xi made clear when he declared in 2017
that the principal contradiction facing Chinese society is now "between
unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-­growing
needs for a better life." As Magnus sums it up, this means a shift in
focus to "improving the environment and pollution, lowering income and
regional inequality, and strengthening the social safety net." Although,
as Magnus writes, China's economy faces several important challenges,
China's leaders have, at the very least, taken steps to address them. It
is time for the United States to do the same. However, to work out a
long-­term strategy, America needs to resolve a fundamental contradiction
in its economic assumptions. Most sophisticated American economists
believe that government-­led industrial policies do not work, arguing
instead for free-market capitalism. If this American belief is correct,
Trump's main trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, should not oppose
China's 2025 government-­led plan to upgrade its technological
capabilities. Lighthizer should sit back and allow this Chinese
industrial initiative to fail, as the Soviet Union's economic plans did.
However, if Lighthizer believes that the 2025 plan could succeed, he
should consider the possibility that America should revisit its
ideological assumptions and, like China, formulate a long-­term
comprehensive economic strategy to match the Chinese plan. Even Germany,
arguably the world's leading industrial power, has such a strategy,
called Industry 4.0. It's obviously less intrusive than the Chinese
version of industrial policy, which, as Scott Kennedy of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies has described, involves the state
playing "a significant role . . . in providing an overall framework,
utilizing financial and fiscal tools, and supporting the creation of
manufacturing innovation centers." Why can't the United States formulate
a plan to match? Ironically, the best country that the United States
could work with in formulating such a long-­term economic strategy might
well be China. China is keen to deploy its \$3 trillion reserves to
invest more in the United States. Adam Posen, the head of the
influential Peterson Institute for International Economics, has already
noted that Trump's trade war with China and the rest of the world has
led net foreign investment in the United States to fall to nearly zero
in 2018. America should also consider participating in China's Belt and
Road Initiative, the Chinese governmental program launched in 2013 to
strengthen regional economic cooperation in Asia, Europe, and Africa
through massive investments in infrastructure. The countries currently
participating in BRI would welcome US participation, as it would help
balance China's influence. In short, there are many economic
opportunities America could take advantage of. Just as Boeing and GE,
two major American corporations, have benefited from the explosion in
the Chinese aviation market, firms like Caterpillar and Bechtel could
benefit from the massive construction undertaken in the BRI region.
Unfortunately, America's ideological aversion to state-­led economic
initiatives will prevent both mutually beneficial long-­term economic
cooperation with China and needed industrial strategies in the United
States. Dragon's Birthday, a mixed-media collage by XU ZHEN © The

mixed-media collage by XU ZHEN © The artist. Courtesy James Cohan, New
York City As China rises, America faces two stark choices. First, should
it continue with its current mixed bag of policies toward China, with
some seeking to enhance bilateral relations and others effectively
undermining them? On the economic front, with the exception of Trump's
latest trade war with China, American policies have consistently treated
China as a partner, while America's political and especially military
policies have most often treated China as an adversary. Second, can the
United States match China and develop an equally effective long-­term
strategic plan to manage the latter's rise? The simple answer is yes.
However, [if China is to be America's number-one strategic priority, as
it should be, the obvious question is whether America can be as
strategically disciplined as China and give up its futile wars in the
Islamic world and its unnecessary vilification of Russia.]{.underline}
It was rational for the United States to have the world's largest
defense budget when its economy dwarfed every other in the world. Would
it be rational for the world's number-­two economy to have the world's
largest defense budget? And if America refuses to give this up, isn't it
a strategic gift to China? China learned one major lesson from the
collapse of the Soviet Union. [Economic growth must come before military
expenditure]{.underline}. Hence, **[it would actually serve China's
long-­term interests for the United States to burn money away on
unnecessary military expenses.]{.underline}** If America finally changes
its strategic thinking about China, it will also discover that [it is
possible to develop a strategy that will both constrain China and
advance US interests]{.underline}. Bill Clinton provided the wisdom for
this strategy in a speech at Yale University in 2003, when he said, in
short, that the only way to manage the next superpower is to create
multilateral rules and partnerships that would tie it down. For example,
though China lays claim to reefs and shoals in the South China Sea, the
UN Law of the Sea Convention has prevented it from declaring the entire
South China Sea an internal Chinese lake. China has also been obliged to
implement WTO judgments that have gone against it. International rules
do have bite. Fortunately, under Xi Jinping, China is still in favor of
strengthening the global multilateral architecture the United States
created, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the
United Nations, and the WTO. China has contributed more UN peacekeepers
than the four other Permanent Members of the UN Security Council
combined. [Hence, there is a window of opportunity for cooperation
between America and China in multilateral forums]{.underline}. To seize
the opportunity, **[American policymakers have to accept the undeniable
reality that the return of China (and India) is
unstoppable]{.underline}**. Why not? From the year 1 to 1820, China and
India had the world's two largest economies. The past two hundred years
of Western domination of global commerce have been an aberration. As
PricewaterhouseCoopers has predicted, [China and India will resume their
number one and two position by 2050 or earlier.]{.underline} The leaders
of both China and India understand that we now live in a small,
interdependent global village, threatened by many new challenges,
including global warming. **[Both China and India could have walked away
from the Paris Agreement after Trump did so. Both chose not
to.]{.underline}** [Despite their very different political systems, both
have decided that they can be responsible global citizens.]{.underline}
Perhaps this may be the best route to find out if China will emerge as a
threat to the United States and the world. If it agrees to be
constrained by multiple global rules and partnerships, [China could very
well remain a different polity]{.underline}---­that is, not a liberal
democracy---­**[and still not be a threatening one.]{.underline}** This
is the alternative scenario that the "China threat" industry in the
United States should consider and work toward.

## Terror Reps Good 

### Terror Real 

#### Terrorism isn't overhyped-their authors don't account for unpredictability and new capabilities

When working abroad for the CIA in the early 1990s, I received a senior
officer from Washington on a mission to collect an important piece of
evidence to help identify the culprits behind the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103. As we sat in a restaurant sipping a glass of wine, \"Mike,\"
a veteran counterterrorism agent, enumerated the reasons why the
investigation was among the CIA\'s highest priorities. His eyes narrowed
as he recalled that the terrorist attack on the commercial airliner had
killed one of our own. \"Terrorism is deeply personal business,\" he
sighed. \"It will be around as long as there are people with scores to
settle.\" He continued, \"Terrorists embarrass politicians, and their
attacks are always painful for the families of their victims. But
terrorism isn\'t a strategic problem. It won\'t affect our way of life,
and it isn\'t a threat to our national security.\" That might have been
true at the time, but [on 9/11, Al Qaeda rewrote the terrorist playbook
by executing mass casualty attacks against strategic U.S. targets. In
essence, these attacks ended one era and ushered in a new one. It is an
age in which a few terrorists hold the means to alter the course of
history with a single blow.]{.underline} Having set a standard that
dares to change the world, [it is likely only a matter of time before
9/11 is eclipsed by an even more devastating event.]{.underline} So why
has it not happened yet? For starters, having pulled off such a complex
and successful operation as 9/11, Osama bin Laden may find it
problematic to settle on anything lesser-or riskier-that might damage
his movement\'s almost mythological standing in the annals of terrorist
lore. Al Qaeda is a conservative, risk-averse organization. The group\'s
leadership apparently recognizes that it is better to not attack at all,
than to do so in a way that falls short of the lofty goals they have set
for themselves. And for now at least, the Al Qaeda leadership may have
few credible options for making good on threats to disrupt the global
economy and to convince their adversaries that they are fighting a war
that cannot be won. [A further-and highly unsettling-explanation of Al
Qaeda\'s extraordinary patience is that group members think time is on
their side. They probably believe they have drawn the United States into
a deepening commitment to fight a protracted insurgency in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. Moreover, [Saddam Hussein was deposed, opening
up long-term possibilities for an Islamic theocracy in Iraq. Gen. Pervez
Musharraf is out of power in Pakistan, and the domestic instability
there is growing every day. These developments create opportunities to
change the global status quo. In other words, Al Qaeda may be waiting
for a perfect storm in the alignment of targets, opportunity, and timing
to launch another game-changing attack]{.underline}. [If they do so, it
will certainly be based on a calculation that the moment is ripe to try
to force Washington\'s hand in ways that favor Al Qaeda\'s long-term
goals]{.underline}. In this light, [the group\'s long-held intent and
persistent efforts to acquire nuclear and biological weapons represent a
unique means of potentially fulfilling its wildest hopes and
aspirations]{.underline}. [As bin Laden declared in 1998, it is his duty
to obtain WMD]{.underline}. He apparently understood at this early
juncture that using such weapons might become necessary at some stage of
his confrontation with the United States and its allies. [With this in
mind, Al Qaeda feverishly pursued nuclear and biological weapons
capabilities before 9/11. These efforts were managed by the group\'s
most senior leadership, with a sense of purpose and urgency that
suggests it was important to make progress on possessing WMD prior to
its 2001 attack on the United States]{.underline}. Yet in spite of bin
Laden\'s declaration and Al Qaeda\'s subsequent efforts to acquire
nuclear and biological weapons, the threat is not widely being treated
as a clear-and-present danger that requires an urgent response. [Nuclear
terrorism detractors point out that the threat has been
hyped]{.underline}. Unfortunately, it is true that some have used the
WMD threat to incite fear and to justify extreme tactics to combat
terrorism. Skeptics argue that there were no WMD in Iraq, so why should
people believe intelligence that terrorists are seriously trying to
acquire them? Plus, if terrorists have such a weapon, why haven\'t they
used it? They also argue that it is impossible for men in caves to
acquire and detonate a nuclear bomb. They acknowledge some nuclear
material may be missing from global stocks, but they exude confidence
that it is surely not available in sufficient enough quantities to
constitute a real threat, and that in any case, it is preposterous to
believe that primitive, unsophisticated terrorists might be able to
construct a bomb capable of producing a nuclear yield. Let us hope the
skeptics are right, because in terms of organizing the international
community to confront the threat posed by large-scale WMD terrorism, not
much has been accomplished. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies,
in the United States and abroad, have been slow to dedicate resources
and leadership to the problem. For example, there is a widespread
assumption that terrorists will employ small-scale, crude forms of
chemical, biological, and radiological weapons because they are easier
to acquire and use. But the weight of the evidence suggests the opposite
is true-i.e., terrorists choose weapons best suited for the targets they
intend to strike. The history of Al Qaeda strikes against the United
States bears this out. The group historically has utilized a remarkably
diverse arsenal of weapons in its attacks against the United States: The
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania were ground attacks; the U.S.S.
Cole bombing was a sea attack; and the World Trade Center and Pentagon
bombings were air attacks. It chose the desired weapons based on
operational considerations, most notably a weapon\'s capacity to destroy
the intended target. [Another dangerous bias in assessing the threat is
the belief that once terrorists obtain a nuclear bomb, they will use it.
Thus, the following argument is proffered: Since Al Qaeda has yet to use
a nuclear weapon, it does not possess one. This might comfort the
doubters, but terrorists may not agree that it is difficult to stash a
nuclear or biological weapon in a safe place for future use, without
fear of discovery. After all, it has proved exceedingly difficult to
find bin Laden and his lieutenant Ayman al-Zawahiri, and we have a
pretty good idea of where they might be hiding. Plus, nothing in Al
Qaeda\'s behavior suggests that its leaders follow predictable patterns
concerning the means and timing of attacks. But accepting that nuclear
terrorism can happen does not mean that it is inevitable]{.underline}.
The odds are stacked against a terrorist successfully acquiring a
nuclear bomb. That said, **[in a twenty-firstcentury world of rare and
unpredictable events, prudent risk management must prioritize threats
based on both the probability of an event and its potential
consequences]{.underline}**. Accordingly, **[terrorists must be denied
any possibility, however remote it might seem, from ever succeeding in
their quest to launch a nuclear or largescale biological attack on any
city]{.underline}**. Better still, [if we can anticipate how a nuclear
terrorist threat might unfold, it stands to reason that we might be able
to prevent such an attack from happening.]{.underline}

### [K2 Prevention]{.underline} 

#### Terrorism is a real threat and we need to talk about it to prevent it

and Non-Proliferation, 10-1-20**17**

(Anna, "Nuclear Terrorism: A Real and Preventable Threat"
<https://armscontrolcenter.org/nuclear-terrorism-real-preventable-threat/>,

I can't say I'd ever spent too much time thinking about nuclear
terrorism before former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry's class on
the issue. I have spent most of my life in America, so the alarming
scenarios that clutter my mind typically involve a mass shooting on the
public transit I use daily in Washington, D.C., or in one of the
hundreds of buildings with no discernible security I enter each year.
But I'm old enough to remember September 11 vividly --- life before it,
and how everything was suddenly different after it. Perhaps that means
[I should have been more aware of potential terrorist threats ever
since. After this week's lesson, I definitely am.]{.underline} This
week's coursework began with a video aptly titled "Dr. Perry's Nuclear
Nightmare." In it, terrorists --- those not working on behalf of any
particular state --- successfully enrich uranium, transfer it to a lab
to create a bomb and ship the bomb via civilian transit to the United
States. Once inside our borders, terrorists load the bomb into a truck,
and have an American citizen who is in on the plan pull the truck into
D.C. traffic to detonate it. It kills 80,000 people instantly, including
every top government official. The Senate Pro Tempore, fourth in the
order of succession, was in Minnesota undergoing treatment for cancer;
he is now president. Newsrooms nationwide receive messages that there
are five more bombs in different American cities, and that one will go
off every week for the next five weeks until all American troops
overseas are sent back to the U.S. There is widespread panic; all
communications networks are down; crime escalates and marshal law is
implemented. The video was terrifying, and not only because in this
scenario, I am instantly killed. Not only because my thoughts
immediately go to my family in Texas, who would be devastated (I think)
over losing me, and terrified of becoming victims of a future attack.
Not only because [I worry about the millions of people across the
country who would die even if they survived an attack because they
couldn't get needed prescriptions, food or shelter.]{.underline} And not
only because it would mean there was yet another moment by which
survivors would define their lives: pre-attack and post-attack. What
terrifies me most is the idea that [our government, our institutions and
the democracy we have painstakingly worked to preserve and improve over
the last 240 years could face so much destruction in such a short period
of time. Things we have built and torn down and rebuilt could now be
beyond repair.]{.underline} Dr. Perry notes that while hypothetical,
[the scenario is based on facts.]{.underline} **[And while we might not
want to think about such scenarios, we must. We must acknowledge the
possibilities of these scenarios so we can work toward their
prevention.]{.underline}** Thankfully, we have not had a nuclear terror
attack on an American city...yet. Other terrorist events involving
weapons of mass destruction have happened. One discussed in great length
this week was orchestrated by Aum Shinrikyo, an apocalyptic cult that
carried out a chemical attack in the Tokyo subway system in 1995,
killing a dozen people and injuring thousands. Margaret Crenshaw, senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at
Stanford University, said Aum Shinrikyo was able to pull off this attack
in orderly Japan because it was considered a religious group and
therefore free from government surveillance. It operated above-ground
and was legal. It actively recruited and hired scientists --- though not
great ones --- to help it acquire nuclear capabilities. After attempts
at acquiring the materials necessary to create a bomb were unsuccessful,
and as Aum Shinrikyo believed the apocalypse was quickly nearing, the
group opted instead for chemical weapons. They released sarin gas on the
subway and, while it was damaging and many were killed, the scientists
they hired produced a weak gas and hadn't identified a way to
disseminate it to maximize destruction. As bad as the attack was, it
could have been much worse. Dr. Perry said [groups like Aum Shinrikyo
haven't pulled off similar attacks in the United States because domestic
intelligence is quick to infiltrate groups as soon as they are
discovered]{.underline}. [I believe in the power of U.S. intelligence,
but it's important to acknowledge that things slip through the
cracks.]{.underline} As Dr. Crenshaw said, **[since 1993, 15 attacks
that could have been catastrophic to the United States were prevented
thanks to foreign intelligence]{.underline}**. That information leads me
to one obvious, but unfortunately increasingly unpopular opinion:
[Countries must continue working together to prevent disasters. Groups
like ISIS and Al-Qaeda are alive and well, and have engaged in chemical
attacks against their enemies. Now is not the time to isolate friends
and allies, to strain relationships over agreements that are working,
and to make (hopefully empty) threats to peace]{.underline}. Because
**[if a nuclear terrorism attack is even a small possibility, we'll need
all the help we can get to prevent]{.underline}** **[it]{.underline}**.
I have to hope that the survivors in the hypothetical video would all
strive to create a better world than they remembered before the attacks
--- a world in which such attacks weren't possible.

#### Talking about terrorism is important to literacy about the real world

**Morin,** licensed clinical social worker, psychotherapist, and college
psychology instructor, 10-6-20**17**

(Amy, "How to Talk to Kids About Terrorism"
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/201711/how-talk-kids-about-terrorism>,
LASA-IZP)

It can be difficult to explain terrorism to kids. After all, when such
acts of violence don't make sense to us, how on earth do you explain it
to children? [Unfortunately, terrorism is a reality in the world we live
in. And it's important to broach the subject]{.underline} with your
kids. Shouldn't We Protect Kids From Adult Problems? You shouldn't
burden children with adult issues just for the sake of toughening them
up. Your third-grader doesn't need to know Grandma's waiting on
important test results and your sixth-grader doesn't need to know the
neighbor was caught having an affair. But, your child is going to hear
about real-world issues like terrorism in one place or another. Whether
they catch a glimpse of the news or overhear kids on the bus talking
about it, most kids know when tragedies strike. It's best that they hear
about it from you. Then, you can ensure they are getting accurate yet
age-appropriate information. You can also provide emotional support and
use the experience as an opportunity to help your child learn how to
cope with difficult circumstances. Even if you think there's no chance
your kids will find out about a terrorist attack, it's still important
to talk about it. The conversations you hold will affect your child's
core beliefs about the world. [Many well-intentioned parents try to
convince their kids that nothing bad will ever happen. But bad things do
happen. That's part of life.]{.underline} So a healthier approach is to
help kids learn that while hardship is inevitable, they're strong enough
to cope with whatever life throws their way. Learning how to cope with
pain is an essential life skill. What to Say to Kids When it comes to
talking to kids about difficult subjects like terrorism, simple and
short is usually the best policy. Here are some examples of
age-appropriate things you might say to your children: Preschoolers --
"A bad person chose to hurt other people. Now, there are lots of people
helping the ones who got hurt and there are police officers working hard
to keep us safe." School-Age Kids -- "A bad person hurt some people and
some of them died. There aren't that many bad people in the world but
every once in a while, a bad person does something terrible.
Fortunately, there are a lot of police officers, doctors, and other
people who are helping to take care of people who got hurt and they're
working hard to keep us safe." Teenagers -- "There was another terrorist
attack. What have you heard about it?" Let your teen do a lot of the
talking. If you're going to talk about religious or political motives,
make sure you do so in a way that doesn't cause your teen to think
certain groups of people are all bad. No matter how old your child is,
[share specific steps that are being taken to keep everyone
safe]{.underline}. Additionally, talk about the kind acts that everyday
citizens engage in to help people who are victims of terrorism. You
might even get your kids involved in becoming helpers. Write a thank you
note to the police department, draw a picture for the first responders,
or send a card to the victims. Empower your kids to see how they can do
their part to make the world a better place. Teach Your Kids to Deal
With the Realities of Life [Rather than keep your children in a
protective bubble, teach them how to care for their emotional wounds in
a healthy manner. The best way to start that process is by engaging in
conversation about emotions.]{.underline} Assist your kids in
identifying specific strategies that help them cope with the discomfort.
While one child may enjoy writing in a journal, another one might find
going for a walk helps her manage her emotions. Become a mental strength
coach who guides---rather than protects---your children. Sharpen their
skills so they can grow up to become confident adults who trust in their
ability to face a challenge square in the eye. One of the 13 things
mentally strong parents don't do is shield kids from pain. So if you're
struggling to help your children turn their struggles into strength,
work on building your own mental muscle. Mentally strong parents raise
mentally strong kids.

#### Discussing terrorism is important-specifically among teenagers

USC Suzanne **Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, No Date**

("Talking to Children about Terrorist Attacks and School and Community
Shootings in the News"
<https://www.schoolcounselor.org/asca/media/asca/Crisis/Terrorism.pdf>,
LASA-IZP)

Children and [teenagers are better able to cope with upsetting news when
they understand more about the event]{.underline}. [They need
information just as adults]{.underline} [do]{.underline}. Begin by
asking what they already understand about what happened. They have
likely heard about it on TV, on the internet or social media, at school,
or from their friends. However, much of their information may not be
accurate. As they explain what they know about the event, you can figure
out what it is they don't already know or understand. Look for
misunderstandings or frightening rumors. [Tell the truth and do not try
to mislead them "for their own good]{.underline}." Children and youth of
different ages understand and react differently according to their
developmental age and unique personal experiences[. It is important to
remember that we cannot assume that children\'s worries are the same as
our own. When we listen to children and come to understand their
feelings and worries, we can better help them make sense of these
experiences and how they affect us all.]{.underline} The amount of
details that children will find useful will depend upon their age. [The
older the child is, the more details will likely be needed to answer
their questions and address their concerns. Provide the basic
information in simple and direct terms]{.underline} and then ask for
questions. Take your cues from children in determining how much
information to provide. [Older children may wish to discuss the larger
implications of the event]{.underline}. Provide reassurance whenever
possible[. Our government, police, and schools are taking steps to
protect us from something like this happening again and to keep us
safe]{.underline}. Children often look for reassurance that they are now
safe after such graphic reminders of danger and hatred. Terrorist acts
and school and community shootings remind us all that we are never
completely safe -- but now is the best time to reassure children that
they can and should feel safe in their school, in their home, and in
their community. While it is useful for children to know enough about
what has happened to feel that they understand what has occurred and
what they should do, it isn't helpful for children (or adults) to be
exposed to graphic images or information or continuous or repetitive
media coverage. Such images and details are often included in coverage
of the event on television, radio and print media, as well as in social
media and elsewhere on the internet. Limit the amount of exposure to
media coverage and discussion in social media. In the immediate
aftermath of a crisis event, it's a good time to turn off television,
computers, and smart phones and come together as a family and community
for discussion and support.

#### Terrorism is a real threat and ignoring it decks prevention

**Friedman,** staff writer at The Atlantic, covering national security
and global affairs, 6-6-20**17**

(Uri, "The Trouble With How Liberals Talk About Terrorism"
<https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/democrats-london-terrorist-attack/529125/>,
LASA-IZP)

[Shortly after three men with knives and a van spent eight minutes
murdering and maiming people at random on London Bridge, one of the
Democratic Party's leading voices on national security
responded]{.underline} on Twitter. Chris Murphy began [by criticizing
Donald Trump for sounding the alarms]{.underline}. "My god," he wrote.
"@POTUS has no idea that the goal of terrorists is to instill a level of
fear in the public disproportionate to the actual threat." [The
Connecticut senator tried to put the threat in proper
proportion]{.underline}. "Terrorism is a real threat," he acknowledged,
"but [remember that since 9/11, you have a greater chance of being
killed by a falling object than by terrorists]{.underline}." Murphy then
issued a five-point rebuttal to Trump's approach to terrorism. He did
not issue a five-point plan for defeating falling objects. Maybe Murphy
didn't do this because [falling objects are not equivalent to three men
ramming and hacking people to death on London Bridge]{.underline}.
[Terrorists attack not just individuals but society, which makes
mortality rates a poor measure of the danger terrorism
poses.]{.underline} Falling objects "attack" neither. The men behind the
carnage in London appear to have been inspired by ISIS, the same
organization that has recently motivated young Muslim men to mow down
civilians from Minya to Manchester, Berlin to Baghdad, Istanbul to
Orlando, and beyond. **[Telling people not to be frightened by such
acts]{.underline}**---that fear is what the terrorists want[**---does
not make those acts less frightening.** Many people are scared by
terrorism, despite the allegedly comforting statistics, because
terrorism is scary]{.underline}. It's designed to be. And [most
people]{.underline} recognize that while terrorism takes various forms,
one of the most virulent strains these days is extremist violence
committed in the name of Islam. They [distinguish]{.underline}, in other
words, [between wobbly furniture and jihadist terror.]{.underline} [In
the raw moments after a terrorist attack, people are often looking for
recognition of the horror and reassurance that they'll be kept safe, not
to be told that they're overreacting or to be soothed with unconvincing
arguments]{.underline}. Franklin Roosevelt famously told Americans
during the Great Depression that "the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself---nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror." Less famous is how
he contextualized that message. He listed the country's many "dark
realities"---the government deprived of revenue, families stripped of
their savings, the unemployed facing the "grim problem of existence,"
and so on. The good news, Roosevelt said, was that these were merely
"material things," and they could be regained. Before fear could be
feared, it had to be reckoned with. [Murphy's reaction to the London
attack captures a common line of reasoning, particularly on the left,
and it recalls some of the clinical rhetoric that Barack Obama used in
similar circumstances. In repeatedly resisting]{.underline} (with some
exceptions) [any language that associated terrorism with extremist
interpretations of Islam, the former president provided fodder to
right-wing critics who argued that he was misleading people about the
nature of the problem.]{.underline} And in his cerebral approach to
counterterrorism, Obama could come across as tone-deaf to the public
mood. After attackers killed 130 people in Paris , for example, Obama
scoffed at reporters' questions about whether the bloodshed would change
his ISIS strategy. My colleague Jeffrey Goldberg documented what
happened next on the president's overseas trip: Air Force One departed
Antalya and arrived 10 hours later in Manila. That's when the
president's advisers came to understand, in the words of one official,
that "everyone back home had lost their minds." Susan Rice, trying to
comprehend the rising anxiety, searched her hotel television in vain for
CNN, finding only the BBC and Fox News. She toggled between the two,
looking for the mean, she told people on the trip. [Later, the president
would say that he had failed to fully appreciate the fear many Americans
were experiencing about the possibility of a Paris-style attack in the
U.S. Great distance, a frantic schedule, and the jet-lag haze that
envelops a globe-spanning presidential trip were working against
him]{.underline}. [But he has never believed that terrorism poses a
threat to America commensurate with the fear it generates. Even during
the period in 2014 when ISIS was executing its American captives in
Syria, his emotions were in check]{.underline}. Valerie Jarrett, Obama's
closest adviser, told him people were worried that the group would soon
take its beheading campaign to the U.S. "They're not coming here to chop
our heads off," he reassured her. [Obama frequently reminds his staff
that terrorism takes far fewer lives in America than handguns, car
accidents, and falls in bathtubs do.]{.underline} Several years ago, he
expressed to me his admiration for Israelis' "resilience" in the face of
constant terrorism, and it is clear that he would like to see resilience
replace panic in American society. Nevertheless, his advisers are
fighting a constant rearguard action to keep Obama from placing
terrorism in what he considers its "proper" perspective, out of concern
that he will seem insensitive to the fears of the American people. Into
this emotional void stepped Donald Trump, who on terrorism is the id to
Obama's ego. He rails against political correctness, portrays "radical
Islamic terrorism" as a grave threat to the nation, and embodies the
fearful alarmism that terrorism can provoke. [Obama's stance on
terrorism also contained a contradiction. He argued that the terrorist
threat was much less severe than other challenges such as climate change
and gun violence. But he didn't scale back his counterterrorism policies
to reflect that assessment]{.underline}. After criticizing the excesses
of George W. Bush's war on terror, Obama launched a massive drone war
against suspected terrorists in several countries. He urged the
government to do more on gun violence, which is responsible for far more
deaths per year in the United States than terrorism is, while
simultaneously claiming that the U.S. government was right to "spend
over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire
agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil." Either Obama
never managed to invest in counterterrorism at the level he felt it
deserved, or he was tacitly acknowledging that terrorism is, in fact, a
big problem that statistics only partially capture. [Murphy faces a
similar dilemma. He has developed a counterterrorism strategy that
includes opposing Trump's travel ban, which he claims will alienate and
unfairly malign Muslims without reducing the terrorist threat;
de-emphasizing military solutions to terrorism in favor of
better-resourced diplomacy and a "new Marshall Plan" of economic
assistance to the Middle East and Africa; and withholding U.S. support
to Saudi Arabia unless it stops spreading fundamentalist Islam across
the Muslim world.]{.underline} "A progressive foreign policy isn't just
looking at the back-end of terrorism, but is also looking at the
front-end of terrorism," Murphy told me earlier this year. "And at the
front-end of terrorism is bad U.S. military policy in the Middle East,
is the Saudi funding of a very intolerant brand of Islam that becomes
the building block of extremism, and poverty and political instability."
Which is why it's perplexing that, around the time we spoke, during a
visit to Yale Law School, Murphy observed that Americans are more likely
to be killed in an elevator accident or by lightning than by terrorism.
Why ditch the Saudis and unveil a new Marshall Plan to solve a problem
that's less threatening than lightning?

#### Underestimating terror ruins counterterrorism measures

**Jennings,** Executive Director of the Australian Strategy Policy
Institute, 4-13-20**17**

(Peter, "The Counterterrorism Yearbook 2017: is terrorism an existential
threat?"
<https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/terrorism-existential-threat/>
LASA-IZP)

[It's often been claimed that terrorism doesn't present an existential
threat to the survival of the nation-state]{.underline}. Former vice
president of the United States, Joe Biden, took this view, which he
claimed helped to keep a sense of 'proportionality' about American CT
responses: '... terrorism is a real threat, but it's not an existential
threat to the existence of the democratic country of the United States
of America. Terrorism can cause real problems. It can undermine
confidence. It can kill relatively large numbers of people. But
terrorism is not an existential threat.' [Two arguments can be put
against Biden's view. The first is that widespread fear of terrorism
certainly contributed to system-changing political movements in 2016
that called into question the viability of some long-cherished
institutions, such as the EU and the EU's Schengen border-free area.
Terrorism has contributed to the rise of populist political movements in
France, Germany and other European countries, which may further
undermine the EU and bring an end to relatively liberal policies on
accepting refugees, close previously uncontrolled borders and weaken
multiculturalism.]{.underline} Although hardly the sole, or even a main
cause, fear of terrorism boosted Donald Trump's election campaign and
was surely an existential threat to the electoral prospects of the US
Democratic Party's candidate, Hillary Clinton. [In the Middle East and
North Africa, terrorism has certainly become an existential threat to
the balance of power that used to prevail in the region. It has led to
the destruction of Syria, Iraq and Yemen and continued to put a number
of established regimes under threat. Terrorism has been used as a
rationale for governments in Turkey, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere
to become internally more repressive and is being used by a number of
countries as a proxy means to weaken external rivals. A second argument
against Biden's view is that western **governments should still worry
about the possibility that terrorist groups will seek access to weapons
of mass destruction**]{.underline} (WMDs). [There's some limited
evidence to suggest that IS has tried to use WMD agents where it can. An
artillery round containing mustard gas was fired onto the Qayyara air
base south of Mosul in September 2016]{.underline}. What limited
evidence there is of WMD attacks using mustard gas or chlorine in Iraq
and Syria shows that the effect is limited, although terrible for the
individuals involved. US concern about the potential for nuclear
terrorism remains substantial, although it's based more on a theoretical
possibility than on strong evidence of terror groups trying to develop
such capabilities. At the fourth and possibly last Nuclear Security
Summit held in Washington DC in April 2016, the summit communiqué said
that ['the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism remains one of
the greatest challenges to international security and the threat is
constantly evolving.]{.underline}' It's a threat that particularly
galvanises India, whose leaders worry that 'insider threats' in the
Pakistan military might see a nuclear weapon transferred to terrorist
organisations threatening India. For all of the concerns in senior
political circles, if a radiological dirty bomb were detonated in a US
city, Joe Biden's claim would still hold that such an attack wasn't a
threat to the American system of government. Then again, President Trump
is now in the Oval Office. [We shouldn't underestimate the
system-changing power of terrorism and the fear of mass-casualty
attacks**. The implication behind dismissing terrorism as not being an
existential threat is that societies may just have to accept that some
level of risk is inevitable**]{.underline}. **[That's an unproductive
way of thinking about CT and one that may well have contributed to the
Obama administration's drift on this issue towards the end of its second
term.]{.underline}** The arrival of the Trump administration and the
half-completed fight to retake Mosul provide two natural reasons for CT
policymakers to pause briefly and reflect on what the priorities should
be for 2017. [The first task, surely, is to redevelop a sense of common
purpose among the Western and Middle Eastern partners in the military
campaign against IS.]{.underline} The US remains the decisive military
force in the campaign, and President Trump's appetite for a more
aggressive fight in Iraq and Syria will set the momentum for operations.
Consolidating Iraq's hold over all of Mosul will be an early critical
task, followed by the need to destroy pockets of IS support in other
parts of central and western Iraq. Syria is no closer to any viable
peaceful solution and, regrettably, violence there will continue. The
next high-priority task will be to prepare for what looks to be a much
more distributed and traditional CT fight around the world, from Paris
to the Sulu Sea. The IS network remains intact, is quite sophisticated,
is good at developing local support and has a large cohort of fighters
who have been through a hardening experience in Iraq and Syria. Putting
this diaspora down will be the major focus of CT in 2017. By comparison
with many countries, Australia's domestic position is good. As the Prime
Minister frequently says, our police and security agencies are among the
best in the world, our geography gives us some protection, and
successive governments have worked hard to have the necessary laws and
regulations in place to support modern CT practices. None of this offers
room for complacency. We'll need to redouble our efforts in CT
cooperation with the countries of Southeast Asia, and we're likely to be
called on to do more rather than less with our military presence in the
Middle East. For CT operators and policymakers, 2017 will be a demanding
year.

#### Underestimating terrorism makes it more dangerous-ISIL

**Berger,** fellow at the Brookings Institution's Project on U.S.
Relations with the Islamic World, 10-15-20**15**

(J.M., "How We Underestimated ISIL"
<https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/how-we-underestimated-isil-213362>,
LASA-IZP)

[Over the course of the past year, many analysts and policymakers have
struggled to pin down the terrorist capabilities of the Islamic
State]{.underline}. As an insurgency, it had proved resilient. As a
terrorist actor, projecting a threat outside its borders, it was
unproven. [Several phases of denial have played out. Initially, some
experts speculated that ISIL had no particular aspirations to execute
spectacular attacks outside its borders. Then, some argued that Al Qaeda
was more sophisticated than ISIL, and therefore posed the greater
threat]{.underline}. Finally, the focus shifted to so-called lone wolf
attacks, an area in which everyone eventually could agree ISIL excels.
[All of these hedged assertions looked reasonable when compared with
vague and irresponsible alarms from some quarters about the existential
threat ISIL allegedly posed to the American homeland and the West in
general. But in a few short weeks, ISIL has flexed its terrorist muscles
in an unambiguous manner]{.underline}. It claimed responsibility for the
October bombing of a Russian passenger plane that killed 224. The group
is also believed to have killed 44 people in a suicide bombing in Beirut
just days ago. And after Friday night's complex attacks in Paris---in
which three teams of operatives employing guns and suicide belts killed
at least 129 people and paralyzed the country---ISIL again took
responsibility. In the months preceding all of this, ISIL had struck
repeatedly around the world, in scores of small and large attacks,
including a synchronized suicide bombing in Sana'a, Yemen, that killed
more than 140 in March. There will be many lessons to unpack in the days
and weeks to come---and there are many details about the Paris attacks
that we don't yet know, including whether it was minutely directed from
ISIL's central command. But [the most important lesson may be how
fundamentally misunderstood ISIL's capabilities, behaviors and
intentions have been. While news reports in the wake of the Paris attack
have talked about ISIL's "escalation of capabilities," what we are
seeing is the deployment of assets that ISIL has held since it declared
its caliphate in June 2014, even as the very definition of terrorist
"capabilities" has become more and more diffuse. In March, my co-author
Jessica Stern and I argued in our book that we should not rule out the
possibility that ISIL might have the capability to carry out spectacular
attacks, even on the scale of 9/11, and I reiterated that warning during
Senate testimony in May. Our evaluation was not based on specific
intelligence but, rather, on simple accounting. While exact numbers are
elusive, ISIL has at least tens of thousands of fighters, most of whom
are battle-tested, including thousands of foreign fighters. That is a
far larger force of potential terrorists than Al Qaeda possessed when it
carried out 9/11 (likely well under 1,000). ISIL can easily staff a
spectacular attack; in fact, it has had that capability for well over a
year. ISIL also has money. Again, specific and credible estimates are
wanting, but based on its estimated peak wealth in 2014, the group today
is believed to have tens of millions of dollars in reserve, and more
likely hundreds of millions]{.underline}. In comparison, Al Qaeda
incurred about \$500,000 in direct costs for the 9/11 attacks, so
funding a spectacular attack is also within ISIL's reach, and has been
for well over a year. Since 9/11, the landscape has changed in other
ways as well. ISIL has expertise using the new technology of social
media, which allow it to sift through hundreds of millions of users in
search of a few thousand who will support and abet the group's
activities. Despite all of this, the question of skill, or
"sophistication" as the pundits like to call it, may have led astray
many analyses of ISIL. Al Qaeda was obsessed with ingenuity, following
in the footsteps of legendary jihadist bomb-maker Ramzi Yousef. The
clever design of Al Qaeda bombs and the group's propensity for intricate
plotting gave counterterrorism officials plenty of shiny objects to
chase. When Al Qaeda tried to deploy liquid bombs against U.S.-bound
airliners in 2006 (modeled after Yousef's designs), the United States
realigned airport security around the threat. Armed with technology and
a large line item in the homeland security budget, we chased the shoe
bomb and the underwear bomb and the printer bomb---all of them
ingenious, and all of them failures. Al Qaeda's love of elegance was a
distraction. Did ISIL have a diabolical genius like Ibrahim al Asiri,
the underwear bomb-maker of Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula? No? Then
perhaps AQAP was "the greatest threat to the U.S. homeland," as The
Heritage Foundation noted in January, and the American Enterprise
Institute argued in September, echoing a great many other assessments
from terrorism analysts and government officials. AQAP does present a
threat, of course, as amply demonstrated by the attack the group
spearheaded at the Charlie Hebdo offices in January. But in the
meantime, ISIL (we currently believe) was preparing to infiltrate an
insider at the airport at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, obviating the need to
disguise a bomb as a convincing houseplant: On Oct. 31, Russia-bound
Metrojet 9268 exploded and crashed, killing more airplane passengers in
one blow than AQAP managed in years of trying. [Terrorism is inherently
improvisational. An attack can be simple from start to finish, such as
ISIL supporters' lone wolf attacks in Canada in 2014. Or it can be
complex in its ambition but technically simple, incorporating guns and
using relatively well-established explosive technology, as currently
appears to be the case in the Paris attacks.]{.underline} Further
complicating matters, AQAP was also perceived as being the most
committed of all jihadist groups to attacking the West in general and
the United States in particular, in part because of its English-language
magazine, Inspire, which combined practical bomb-making advice with
ideological incitement. But in reality, AQAP carried out only a handful
of attacks, and at a languid pace, over the course of many years. It
spared one trainee for the failed underwear bomb plot on Christmas Day
2009 and two operatives for the Charlie Hebdo attack. It boasted of
spending just \$4,200 on the 2010 UPS bomb plot, in which a bomb
disguised as a printer toner cartridge was smuggled onto a cargo plane
and intercepted before detonation. This activity was far from trivial.
Much of it was lethal, and the plots that failed could have been
deadlier still. But all of this activity made use of a fraction of the
resources held by AQAP, one of the largest and best-funded Al Qaeda
affiliates. It was clear that AQAP was far more focused on its local
insurgency in Yemen than on the "far enemy." Of course, after ISIL
seized Mosul in June 2014, it similarly was perceived to be focused on
waging war at home and establishing its purported caliphate. While this
perception was not incorrect, it was incomplete. When the West took a
kinetic interest in ISIL's activities, in September 2014, the group
responded with provocations, starting with the grisly videotaped murders
of Westerners taken hostage in Syria. [There was scant reason to hope
these provocations would stop when ISIL's supply of hostages ran out. In
response to every threat, the group has responded with more and more
intense provocation. When Jordan joined the American-led coalition
against ISIL in September 2014, ISIL responded by burning a captured
Jordanian pilot alive. And when Russia began airstrikes in Syria earlier
this fall (albeit with more bark than bite), ISIL, it appears, took down
a Russian plane.]{.underline} As the group faces growing pressure on its
holdings in Iraq and Syria---losing Sinjar to Kurdish forces just hours
before the Paris attacks---ISIL will continue to seek ways to change the
conversation and preserve its image of strength. And if the coalition
succeeds in dislodging ISIL from its primary geographical strongholds,
it will free up thousands of fighters to take up new roles as terrorists
in more far-flung places, a prospect that most in the West are probably
not adequately prepared to face. We should also remember that while
advanced training and ample resources come into play in a terrorist
group's capabilities, perhaps the most important assets to a terrorist
plot or a mass murder are patience and discipline, qualities we can do
little to prevent people from developing. [These days, almost anyone has
the "capability" to kill and maim dozens of people with little or no
support---the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston, Dylann Roof in Charleston,
Adam Lanza in Newtown. The game-changing precedent was set in 2011, when
Norwegian right-wing extremist Anders Breivik managed to bomb a
government building and then slaughter 77 people, mostly children, all
by himself, without any outside funding or specialized training.
Spectacular terrorism no longer requires spectacular resources. A few
outliers in a world of 7 billion people can wreak tremendous havoc. When
those few can find like-minded people across wide geographies who
reaffirm and tangibly support their desire to kill, the stakes only
rise.]{.underline} The technology of killing may have vaulted past our
ability to process and understand the problem. Although ISIL is the
vanguard of this new style of organization, it will not be the last
extremist group to exploit these dynamics. Even as we try to measure the
proportionality of our response to an attack, our evaluation of
terrorist capabilities must open to an ever-wider array of possible
disasters from an increasingly diverse group of adversaries. It will not
be easy.

[Tribunals of accounting deal with questions surrounding combat-related
killings connecting to, for example, the appropriate use of violence,
with the question of the care taken when employing violence, and with
the question of responsibility in the case of wrongdoing.]{.underline}
These questions might be dealt with within a military logic or in light
of competing non-military logics. Dealing with alleged massacres, the
use of excessive force, \"friendly fire\" incidents, tribunals can be
legally formalized in the course of court hearings (see below:
KOLANOSKI, one-off purposive political inquiries (see LIVIO), or in
public debates and media controversies (see below: ADLER; COHEN; BELLMER
& EBERT). While distinct, [these settings take up the possibility of
learning from combat-relating killings, and can lead to the adjustment
of tribunal procedures]{.underline} (or the invention of new ones[) in
light of particular cases and the exigencies they bring to
light.]{.underline} \[19\] [Before political communities implement a
tribunal for recounting---including demands for military
accountability---a specific incident of \"combat-related killing\" might
be problematized in a public arena.]{.underline} While many such
incidents pass without comment, [others raise moral, political, and/or
legal concerns.]{.underline} BELLMER and EBERT show how [public debates
deliver \"first assessments\" on the question of whether legal
regulations have been violated or not.]{.underline} Legal assessment
outside the judicial system can fuel political controversy. In their
case study, BELLMER and EBERT analyzed the application of different
legal norms in initial political reactions to the Kunduz airstrike. They
showed how politicians and other players employed a strong distinction
between \"soft\" and \"hard\" law in order to be able to portray the
violations of certain rules as legitimate. \[20\] COHEN analyzed how the
Gaza Flotilla Raid (in 2010) was narrated in Israeli media compared with
official statements by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson\'s
unit. She argued that [different professional routines and constraints
led to differences in reporting: a journalistic mode of writing, on the
one hand, that is more \"emotional and dramatic, emphasizing moral and
mythopoetic\" forms of legitimation, with the IDF using, on the other,
mostly an unemotional and formal rhetoric, which included many direct
speech quotations.]{.underline} \[21\] DOR\'s paper presented a study of
newspaper editors\' work, presenting them as important mediators in
journalistic accounts of combat-related killings. His research question
examined what editors do when they detect contradictions between
reporters\' copy and their common sense presuppositions. DOR
demonstrated how the killing of four Palestinian children was reported;
suggesting the story as it eventually appeared did not challenge or
disturb Israeli \"common sense.\" In taking this line, he identified a
complex selection process whereby content is transformed from initial
reports to final articles. By doing so, editors align journalistic
content with the cultural hegemony. As DOR argues, they do so by
silencing and marginalizing opposing voices. In this way, they put
together streamlined reports fitting presumed mainstream sentiments.
They flatten the initially much more pluralistic and diverse accounts
that exist even in reporters\' pre-edited texts. \[22\] [It is not just
killings of civilians or of friendly forces that cause alarm among the
public on the \"home front.]{.underline}\" ADLER studied accounting for
the killing of Osama BIN LADEN. The official accounting turned
problematic when German chancellor Angela MERKEL expressed her
\"pleasure\" upon hearing about it. ADLER showed how doing a debate is
methodically and locally accomplished by participants within the
discourse through a \"media dialogical network\". [The dialogic
character of the debate developed from a \"clutter of voices\" into a
dynamic turn taking system and centered on moral obligations vis-à-vis
an enemy and what constitutes an appropriate and acceptable emotional
response to \"anybody\'s death\":]{.underline} Should the
chancellor---should \"we\"---be allowed to feel happy about anyone\'s
death? \[23\] The public consideration of combat-related killings
generally dismisses other military-related crimes. HYNDMAN called
attention to a widely disregarded phenomenon: the immense and growing
numbers of rape victims within the USArmy. 7 Victims are required to
report the incident to their military superiors---a procedure that often
causes more problems for the victims than it may for the perpetrators.
In relation to this problem, [media attention usually does not reach the
level necessary to prompt state investigations]{.underline}. Drawing on
this problematic, HYNDMAN developed her argument that next to an
epistemological critique of numbers (how to give a more appropriate
count) an ontological critique of the numbers is required: What/who
counts at all and what should be counted to turn a problem into a matter
of political concern? \[24\] [Media debates often collect a plurality of
accounts on combat-related killings. These reflect the conflictual
nature of these accounts.]{.underline} MINOR pointed out that and how
fundamental differences between the testimonies of soldiers, victims,
and NGOs , become apparent when expressed in numbers (see MINOR, 2013).
At times, estimated death counts oscillate massively depending on who
has made the count. MINOR presented data by an international
organization that records casualties caused by armed violence. [By
monitoring and analyzing media coverage, the organization attempts to
produce counts that meet the high standards that are usually required by
official investigations and committees. Their work, thus, intercedes in
what could be called public mass media tribunals and formal legal
procedures.]{.underline} In this respect, information in the mass media
itself seems insufficient to enter legal procedures as evidence. \[25\]
[The urge to launch a political investigation may turn topical in media
debates.]{.underline} In the cases dealt with in the workshop, the
formal committees were both preceded and accompanied by mass media
attention. Following \"public problematization,\" formal inquiries
function as democratic rituals in a DURKHEIMian sense: the public order
is restored, and that which is perceived as deviant is led back into the
common acceptance. \[26\] 4.2 Arenas II: weak or strong procedure Case
studies deal with more or less \"self-referential\" procedures.8 By
procedure, we mean a somehow formally-programmed process leading towards
a decision. 7 See an earlier study on the role of gender in conflict
zones in GILES and HYNDMAN (2004). 8 We refer to the study by SCHEFFER,
MICHAELER and SCHANK (2008) of the \"weak and strong\" procedural frames
that highlight the various ways in which discursive events/processes
make it possible to draw boundaries around a political or cultural
environment and through which they create/utilize knowledge,
membership-roles, and communicative styles in the course of their own
procedural history. By \"self-referential\" we mean a decision-making
process (including its communicative and epistemic grounding) that deals
with accounts only, if they derive from within its procedural course,
meaning under the auspices of its own personnel and within formats of
its staging.9 Here, case studies focus on the methods, techniques, and
resources drawn upon in debating, examining, and offering accounts of
some issue or event. Some highlight the hegemonic modes of thought that
come to the forefront in the course of an inquiry: the hierarchy of
voices and forms of knowledge it establishes and reproduces. LIVIO
demonstrated how the Israeli Turkel Commission10 managed to establish a
legitimizing account of the Gaza Flotilla Raid (in 2010) through
powerful contextualization. LIVIO focused on moments during the hearings
that he identified as \"contextual reconfigurations.\" In these moments,
participants changed the operational definition of what counts as the
relevant context, here most commonly historical context. While working
on the facts of the specific case, the committee board concurrently
mobilized the master narrative of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict.
Committee members interrupted eyewitness accounts of the flotilla raid
by instructing them to employ the \"right\" context. The investigations
thus showed all signs of a weakly self-referential procedure due to
countless importations of ready-made views, authorities, and versions.
Moreover, this weakness is reflected in the selection of committee
members, the allocation and proportional distribution of voices, and
rhetorical devices, all following readymade external definitions
\"transported\" from outside the proceedings. \[27\] Other case studies
focused on the efforts of committees to reconstruct an incident of
combat-related killing on the ground of military accounts. MAIR et al.
pointed to difficulties in coping with cockpit communication. As the
investigators already knew that the pilots involved had misidentified a
target later on, they had problems understanding the enfolding
meaningfulness of the action prior to this misidentification. Everything
had to lead to the misidentification. [KOLANOSKI showed how different
human rights lawyers relate to military video material in order to argue
that civilians have been illegally killed in the Kunduz
airstrike]{.underline} (Afghanistan). Her two case studies point to
interrelations of fact-making and norm-making in legal processes. In
light of the lawyers\' references to the (same) video material,
KOLANOSKI can contrast two variants of interrelated fact- and
norm-making: 1. In the criminal case, the victims\' representatives
argued that the photos were so poor that they did not provide sufficient
ground to discriminate between insurgents and civilians. Through an
exhaustive interpretation of humanitarian law, they explicated legal
obligations of combat soldiers. In this line of argument, the video
material ought to prove that the soldiers in charge failed to take
legally required measures: They should have gathered more information
before the actual airstrike. 2. In the civil case, the lawyers for the
victims used the pictures differently. They argued that on the basis of
the visual material \"a reasonable soldier\" could have identified
civilians. Taking up this argument, the respective court hearing was set
up to test this substantial empirical claim. In a 9 An example would be
the criminal procedure that would accept evidence only, if it has been
delivered by an eye-witness statement within a court hearing (see
SCHEFFER, 2010). 10 The commission was appointed by the government to
investigate the events surrounding the killing of nine international
activists on board what was labeled \"the Gaza Flotilla.\" Towards an
Understanding of the Cultural Capacities to Deal with Matters of War
(Conference Essay) public event, judges and lawyers came together to
watch the videos and to discuss their interpretation. The session was
complemented by expert testimonies (two military experts and one
Afghanistan expert). By doing so, the court declared itself
\"sufficiently competent\" to see what any professional military man was
able to see. [The participants entered a quest for signs that would
positively display civilians as civilians. The related legal obligations
ascribed to any combat soldier were rather straightforward with no need
for further interpretation: Do everything to avoid bombing civilians
that you know of! \[28\] These studies of formal procedure and how these
procedures produced or validated claims to knowledge in relation to the
cases to be placed in front of them touched upon what Michael LYNCH
discussed by reference to the notion of \"prima facie
evidence.\"]{.underline} LYNCH raised the question of how \"leaked,\"
\"disclosed,\" \"mobilized\" natural data gets taken up in political and
judicial efforts to recount \"combat-related killings.\" A lot of hope
has been invested in this form of data. It seems to offer \"proof\" of
\"what really happened after all\" (GARFINKEL, 1967) and, therefore,
seems to make it far easier to actually pinpoint responsibilities and
guilt, particularly among government and military officials. LYNCH
linked this point to an enumeration of the counterstrategies governments
adopt when facing the disclosure of prima facie evidence. Even if
disclosure cannot be avoided, discredited, or punished, there are more
problems than expected when it comes to actually using this evidence as
actual proofs. It is, in other words, hard to put the finger on alleged
\"wrongdoings.\" What then, is the role of experts in reinterpreting
data that had been claimed to be readily understandable by \"anyone\"?
The role of experts was discussed in detail in a data session on the
Rodney King trial. In another data session, the workshop discussed the
Wikileaks\' categorical editing of the military footage of a shooting in
Iraq, later known as the \"collateral damage\" video. \[29\] In general,
up to this point in the workshop, accounts of combat-related killings
had been moved to the fore and shown to be part and parcel of the
application as well as the development of criminal, civil, and
international law. Legal examinations and judgments, in turn, were shown
to renew the regulations for troops-in-combat including the accounting
requirements and calculations surrounding their combat activities in the
first place. Whether cases serve as precedent or shift the normative
grounds is an empirical question, both for scholars as well as for
members. \[30\] 5. Cultural Representations Military accounts and the
many public, legal, and political tribunals have farreaching (often
unexpected) effects, concerning the cultural representations and shared
memorization of combat-related killings. The representations and
collective memories materialize in school books, in maps, in official
histories, in movies, in documentaries and in semantics and
\"categorization devices\" (SACKS, 1992). As some papers demonstrated,
cultural representations themselves become objects of fierce debates and
conflicts (again). Others might have gained, for some periods, the
status of historic facts. The same is true aesthetic products that
provide the collective images and imaginaries for specific cases such as
a given combat, conflict, or war. \"[Lessons learned\" from military
conflicts can be considered to be another object of cultural
sedimentation, within militaries themselves or in relation to the place
and status of the military within (imagined) political
communities.]{.underline} BELLMER and EBERT showed how, [in the public
debate over Kunduz among government and opposition politicians, shared
assumptions implied that the \"Germans\" had a higher degree of
awareness because of their \"disastrous\" national
war-history.]{.underline} \[31\] Four contributions dealt with the
memorization of combat-related killings, some on the micro level of
biographical work, some on the cultural level of shared or contested
convictions. JENKINGS in addition to his observations of friendly-fire
accounts encountered during JENKINGS and WOODWARD\'s study of \"The
Social Production of the Contemporary Military Memoir\" (see JENKINGS &
WOODWARD, 2014a, 2014b; WOODWARD & JENKINGS, 2010, 2012a, 2012b),
offered an account of his personal memory of a blue-and-blue incident
that he witnessed as a British Soldier on the Falkland Islands. The talk
set up a discussion on the use of personal memoirs for scientific
purposes. BERGMANN pointed to the different practical epistemologies of
accounts given during the event (logics-in-use) and in subsequent
accounts (reconstructed logics). Discussion ensued on how did JENKINGS\'
memories, and that of other soldiers\' autobiographic accounts of their
combat experience, develop over time? Does spatiotemporal distance
matter? How does repetition matter? How does the overhearing audience
matter? [BERGMANN suggested studying the transformation of the story
along a \"telling history\": \"fresh\" stories, second stories,
\"prepared\" stories, and \"stale\" stories, as part of different kinds
of stories, routines and traditions. It was agreed that these
memorizations, especially in the form of published memoirs, could be
significant in a cultural analysis of \"accounting for combat-related
killings.\" \[32\]]{.underline}

#### Recording civilian casualties plays an indispensable role in accountability and providing info for humanitarian aid- this knowledge helps prevent future deaths

**Dardagan**, Codirector of Every Casualty, **15**

(Hamit, <https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h5041.full>, DG)

[The impulse to create a permanent record of a war, including those who
died in it, is far from new.]{.underline} The Louvre's curators believe
that the museum contains the remains of the oldest known historical
document, and certainly its oldest war memorial, the Stèle des Vatours,
so named because of its representations of vultures feasting on the
corpses.[1](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-1)
Dating from around 2450 BC the Sumerian memorial "commemorates not the
glorious dead of the victors but their victory and the sorry fate of the
vanquished, who are shown on the stele lying piled one upon the
other."[2](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-2)
Herodotus records 192 Athenians killed in the Battle of Marathon in 490
BC, an exact number that could be verified as much as 600 years later by
the ancient Greek geographer Pausanias, who saw the stele inscribed with
their names at their burial mound. Tellingly, the rounded number of 6400
Persians killed, estimated by the Greek victors, remains a matter of
historical
debate[3](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-3)---even
today any record of casualties that is unable to name the dead faces
this risk to its credibility. Such customary records either exult in the
scale of victory or pay tribute to the common sacrifice of soldiers, or
both. Contemporary equivalents would include military successes measured
in enemy deaths (still prevalent despite the occasional
denial[4](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-4))
or the many respectful and often beautiful war memorials listing
soldiers by name (but generally limited to one side in the conflict).
[Move to include details of civilians Another way of recording
casualties has developed, however, that is based largely in civil
society and is represented in conflict regions across the
globe.[5](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-5)
It is both more universalist in its values and more reflective of the
information age in which we live.]{.underline} And [its starting point
is concern with the impact of war on people.]{.underline} [These
projects always include civilians]{.underline}, whom they also try to
name, [as is only fitting for a record of human losses.]{.underline}
Using readily available databases, they systematically store, organise,
and classify as much accompanying detail as they can about each victim
and their manner of death. The key variables are name, demographic
details, cause of injury, and time and location of death. The end result
of this sometimes
dangerous[6](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-6)
and always painstaking work is structured data that can be studied. In a
linked article Debarati Guha-Sapir and colleagues analyse such data on
the Syrian conflict to reveal particular vulnerabilities and patterns of
harm among population groups (p
000).[7](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-7)
The database for their study was compiled by the Syria based Violations
Documentation Center (VDC), a human rights monitoring group that, like
several other civil society organisations in the country, has been
publishing a continuously updated list of documented and reported
casualties in the civil war that broke out in 2011. All such projects
(and their counterparts in other countries) have their limitations---and
there remains much room for improvement in this fast evolving field.
Crucial to Guha-Sapir and colleagues' study is that VDC's project takes
pains to distinguish between combatants and civilians. [War and armed
violence may be the result of human actions, but that doesn't mean we
fully understand its effects (or, for that matter, its causes). One
major gap in our knowledge is the large scale effects that various
weapons have on civilian men, women, and children.]{.underline}
Conventional weapons of war might be designed to kill or wound enemy
combatants, as those who design, manufacture, and sell them will be
ready to explain[. But what effect do they have on civilian populations
when used where they live?]{.underline} How much more likely are
children to be killed by certain classes of weapons than others? These
are among the questions that Guha-Sapir and colleagues set out to
investigate through careful statistical analysis of VDC's dataset.
[Their findings should give pause to anyone who thinks there can be a
safe hiding place for women and children when high explosives are being
used in populated areas, or who imagines that Syria's many bombed-out
apartment blocks must have first been emptied of civilians. Their
analysis also underlines the urgency of growing moves to ban the use of
such indiscriminate weapons in populated
areas.[8](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-8)
A movement for more detailed, consistent, reliable, and useful recording
of casualties is gaining momentum and high level support, including from
the secretary general of the United
Nations[9](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-9)
and various of its agencies.]{.underline} [This is]{.underline} partly
[because of growing recognition that recording casualties can provide
critical and timely information for humanitarian relief work and have an
indispensable role in post-conflict truth and accountability
processes.]{.underline} The range of good practices in casualty
recording is becoming increasingly well
understood,[10](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-10)
and steps are well underway to establish globally recognised standards
so that casualty datasets
improve.[11](https://www-bmj-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/351/bmj.h5041#ref-11)
We may wish that it were no longer true, but [recording deaths in war
remains a necessity in the 21st century. If treated seriously, the
knowledge we gain from doing so may help us prevent further
deaths.]{.underline}

### AT Util Reps Bad 

#### Utilitarian representations of civilian casualties are valuable- generate empathy and are key to decreasing public support for maintaining intervention in conflicts

Leeds, **17**

<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002717729733>, DG)

[In identifying likely moderators of public reactions to civilian
casualties, it is useful to contrast what might be called utilitarian
and social psychological models.]{.underline} The first describes the
kind of [cost--benefit analysis]{.underline} approach that [has become
the dominant framework for understanding]{.underline} not only [public
reactions to military casualties]{.underline} ([Larson
1996](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider);
[Gelpi, Feaver, and Reifler

but also support for war in general]{.underline} ([Jentleson
1992](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider);

[The latter portrays citizens as more influenced by affective
considerations, for example, the extent to which casualties are
humanized or perceived as "innocent."]{.underline}
[2](javascript:popRef('fn2-0022002717729733'))[Friedrich and Dood (2009,
2549)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)
help to illustrate the distinction via two priming conditions used with
the economics students in their first experiment. In the introduction to
the survey, half of the participants heard themselves characterized "as
someone who is receiving formal training in cost-benefit
decision-making"; the other half heard a reference to their community
service activities and, as such, were primed to think in more humanistic
terms. [At the heart of the utilitarian model is the number of civilian
casualties. More casualties mean a costlier war and so, with the
benefits held constant, should mean reduced public
approval.]{.underline} This simple equation contrasts with the detailed
debate about the relationship between military casualties and support
for war, involving disputes about whether that relationship is linear or
loglinear and whether cumulative or marginal casualties matter more
([Mueller
1973](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider);
[Gartner
2008b](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
While that debate was driven by aggregate time series analysis of
casualty rates and opinion poll trends, our study is based on survey
experiments allowing only limited manipulation of civilian casualty
numbers. As such, we cannot draw precisely the functional form of the
relationship between civilian deaths and public support, but we can
address some basic questions about that association. Most simply, [how
responsive is support for force to increasing numbers of civilian
casualties?]{.underline} Are there signs of numbing, whereby large
numbers begin to have diminishing effects because people cannot process
the implications of these statistical aggregates ([Slovic
2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider))?
Meanwhile, at the lower end, does responsiveness only begin at a certain
point because a certain number of civilian casualties are
regarded---consciously or otherwise---as acceptable or inevitable?
[Another core term in the utilitarian model is the perceived success of
military action. Gelpi et al. conclude that "beliefs about the
likelihood of success matter most in determining the public's
willingness to tolerate US military deaths in combat"]{.underline}
([2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider),
8). Insofar as [citizens also show aversion to foreign civilian
casualties,]{.underline} we can expect likelihood of success to have a
similar moderating effect. This "success" could be defined in various
ways, both by the elites proclaiming it and by their public audience
([Berinsky and Druckman
2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)),
but the point remains the same. The more convinced is the public that
military action will deliver the expected benefits, the readier it is to
pay the costs in terms of foreign civilian casualties. [Conversely,
especially when the anticipated civilian death toll is very high, any
skepticism about the success of military action may erode public support
for war.]{.underline} We turn now to the social psychological model, in
which a first likely moderator of casualty aversion is the perceived
similarity of the foreign civilians under threat ([Riek, Mania, and
Gaertner
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
While their mere foreignness introduces one obvious source of
difference, there are also potential sources of similarity and thus
in-group status. Religion is one obvious example, particularly pertinent
in a post-9/11 era in which, as [Smidt
(2005](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider),
246) puts it, "militant Islam may well have replaced the Soviet Union in
the eyes of most Americans as the object of opposition in American
foreign policy" (see also [Kalkan, Layman, and Uslaner
2009](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
Two recent studies found the US and British public more willing to use
force against Islamic than against Christian countries ([Johns and
Davies
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider);
[Lacina and Lee
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)),
which at the very least suggests that the public might be more averse to
Christian than to Muslim civilian
casualties.[3](javascript:popRef('fn3-0022002717729733')) The same pair
of studies also highlighted adversary regime type as a factor
influencing support for war (see also [Tomz and Weeks
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider))
and so it is at least worth examining whether the public is also more
concerned about civilian deaths in democratic than in autocratic states.
On that front, however, there are also grounds for doubt. [Regime type
is a rather less human or personal basis for in-group status than is
religion.]{.underline} Moreover, civilians in an autocratic state might
be regarded as innocent victims of their government's aggressive foreign
policies, reducing hostility against them ([Falomir-Pichastor et al.
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
While not explicitly manipulating regime type, [Gelpi et al.
(2009](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider),
256) compared reactions to North and South Korean civilian casualties
and found public support for war to fall by the same margin. [Mention of
innocence highlights the framing of civilian deaths as another important
moderator of casualty aversion.]{.underline} What we refer to here is
not the kind of numbers-in-context frame examined by [Boettcher and Cobb
(2006)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)

in the case of military casualties---those are more like modifications
of the cost--benefit model. [Our concern instead is with the way that
civilian casualties are described or presented. The phrase civilian
casualties is itself rather bowdlerized in two ways: the reference to
"civilians" rather than to "people" or some other more humanizing term;
and, as also with the military, the euphemistic use of "casualties"
rather than deaths.]{.underline} Various alternatives--mentioning deaths
more explicitly, describing civilians as "ordinary people," using an
"innocent bystanders" frame--seem likely to generate more empathy and,
in turn, perhaps to erode support for the military action that puts
civilians at risk. [The striking effect of civilian casualties in

experiment may be due at least in part to the cueing word "innocent" in
the treatment. Another cue for innocence, more indirect but still
powerful, is the gender and age of casualties ([Carpenter
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
This could be a matter of framing---that is, simply reminding the public
that women and children are likely to be among the casualties---or a
case of providing concrete information about actual female or juvenile
deaths.]{.underline} In the context of military casualties, [Gartner
(2008a](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider))
finds that the loss of servicewomen does have a disproportionate effect
on public opinion but only if what he calls primary casualty
information---numbers and trends in overall casualties---is unclear.
This implies that a utilitarian model has the potential to trump a
social psychological model. It is hard to know whether these findings
can be extrapolated to the case of civilian casualties. Nonetheless,
since "women and children" have traditionally been deemed to deserve
particular protection from the consequences of war---that is, to be the
paradigm instances of noncombatant immunity (although see [Sjoberg
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider))---then
it seems likely that public support for military action will be
inhibited should they be explicitly mentioned as likely civilian
casualties. [A final component of the social psychological model is the
identifiability of civilian casualties. Studies of the "identifiable
victim" effect ([Jenni and Loewenstein

indicate that the key to humanizing casualties is to highlight the
plight of particular individuals or families.]{.underline} Such
"exemplars" are a stock means by which the media illustrate statistical
arguments ([Brosius and Bathelt

and are more likely than is quantitative information to activate
affective reasoning ([Small, Loewenstein, and Slovic

information.]{.underline} [[Gartner

shows that the images accompanying coverage of military casualties can
influence support for the conflict, and again there is reason to suppose
that the same is true with civilian casualties.]{.underline} [Parry
(2011)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)identifies
several ways in which photographs of casualties may vary, many of which
fall under the heading of "graphicness" (see also [Silcock, Schwable,
and Keith
2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
One such is the degree of physical alteration to the victim: that is,
the extent to which injuries are highly visible ([Fahmy
2005](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
However, the relationship between graphicness and impact is not
straightforward. While the portrayal of injuries and suffering may help
to generate empathy, graphic photographs can also have an anaesthetizing
effect ([Sontag
2003](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717729733?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
A more "normal" photograph of a foreign civilian while alive and well
may do more to encourage humanization. The utilitarian and social
psychological models of civilian casualty aversion are to some extent
compatible. [Public support for force could respond to all of the
factors mentioned above.]{.underline} One way of comparing the two
models is simply to assess the relative importance of cost--benefit and
more affective considerations. A subtler means is to test for
interactions between the two. The social psychological model would
predict that responsiveness to casualty numbers depends heavily on how
those casualties are seen and felt by the public. [However, if support
for war dwindles as the civilian death toll rises, regardless of factors
like similarity, framing, or identifiability, then that would support
the utilitarian model.]{.underline}

#### US hypocrisy ultimately doesn't matter- there's no course of action if every administration has to be morally consistent

Witwatersrand, **06**

If currency in ordinary language is the measure, there is no difficulty
in attributing moral agency to a state. [The American state, for one,
has been accused of hypocrisy by countless critics. Equally the laws of
many countries attribute moral personality to
organisations.]{.underline} They do so properly, since organisations
carry out actions that have consequences for people. These actions are
often the product of organisational processes -- rules, rituals,
cultures, collective action effects -- rather than of single or
particular individuals. [Where an actor needs to be held accountable for
them, it may thus be an organisation, not persons. This stricture holds
true for the US.]{.underline} Even so, vesting moral agency in an
organisation is not unproblematic. An organisational vice may be an
outcome of disparate inputs, some perhaps virtuous, others not. [The
state's internal diversity blurs its moral identity in ways especially
problematic for the charge of hypocrisy. During a given administration
the president, advisers or indeed departments might be morally
consistent in themselves, yet in combination may seem hypocritical.
Equally, administrations might be consistent in themselves, yet
inconsistent with previous administrations.]{.underline} There is
plentiful evidence of intra-bureaucratic, partisan and personality
factionalism, as well as of executive-Congress tension, in the making of
American foreign policy.4 [There have unsurprisingly also been
significant foreign policy shifts across time.]{.underline}5 [None of
this matters if we take to its logical conclusion the view that the
state is nevertheless the resultant of these disparate elements. The
problem with going all that way is that it leaves unclear how current
state personnel are meant to act in light of the hypocrisy charge. Must
one official refrain from publicly advocating global democracy because
other officials support authoritarian overseas allies? If an incumbent
administration acts idealistically, is it morally improving the state or
rendering it still more historically inconsistent?]{.underline} While
the state is in some ways unitary and collective, in [others it is
multiple and individuated.]{.underline} For a charge against an
organisation to carry morally constructive force, [it must have
identifiable implications for individual as well as organisational
behaviour. We can rescue the state's moral agency provided that we
specify (1) what individuals can do to escape or act on a corporate
accusation and (2) what can by done (by individuals or systemically) to
enable the organisation as a whole to escape or act on an accusation. In
the case of state hypocrisy, requirement (1) can be met by affirming
that individuals or organs within a hypocritical state are not
necessarily hypocritical themselves.]{.underline} Individual politicians
and bureaucrats can avoid the charge provided they act
non-hypocritically during their own tenure and across the whole of their
jurisdiction. They are moreover not disqualified from doing good, or
personally opened to the charge of hypocrisy, by the inconsistency of
their praiseworthy action with the words and actions of predecessors or
personnel outside their control. Those levelling the hypocrisy charge
ought, on their side, to specify the accused more clearly, even if
victims of injustice are excused the obligation to draw finer
distinctions. I am directing my own charge of hypocrisy against the US
as an organisation, though it seems applicable to all recent US
administrations separately. How, to satisfy (2), can a state cease to be
hypocritical? [For one, it must act morally consistently at a given
time, where that time coincides with the present and encompasses at
least, say, a single presidential administration in the US (or as much
of it as has played out). In addition, the current government must
renounce the contradicting actions of predecessors and officials and,
indeed, to do so in some sense on behalf of the state.]{.underline}
Renunciation by the state of bad actions requires that it issue official
apologies, redress injustices, provide compensation, undertake
institutional reforms to guard against repeat offending, change the way
issues are taught in public schools, initiate a process of glasnost
including the declassification of information, and acknowledge past
errors in everyday public rhetoric. When in 1999 President Clinton
issued an apology for past American dealings in Central America, urging
that the US not repeat its mistakes in the region,6 he fulfilled just
one requirement of (2). In addition to showing that states can be moral
actors it is also necessary, I indicated earlier, to demonstrate that
American actions are inconsistent with US public value commitments. The
task of illustrating a disparity between the two falls to the next two
sections. The more intriguing and central question of whether hypocrisy
is bad enough to disqualify a military intervention, and if so why and
when, will be addressed after that. Since at least 1917, when President
Wilson enunciated his Fourteen Points, the US has publicly committed
itself to supporting democratic self-government and human rights both at
home and abroad. The US has frequently chided others for violating one
or both; and considers itself a beacon for these principles in the
world, advancing their cause everywhere against various kinds of
opposition, including Communist, authoritarian-nationalist, Nazi and
Islamic fundamentalist. Thus Wilson, facing German militarism, promised
to 'make the world safe for democracy', President Truman 'to support
free peoples' against Communism and the United States National Security
Strategy of 2002 to 'extend the benefits of freedom across the globe' in
the wake of the al Qaeda attacks of September 11th 2001. [A number of
writers have emphasised the centrality of moral ideals to America's
sense of self, suggesting that it has given a peculiar slant to
America's projection of itself abroad.]{.underline}7 The content of
America's creed of freedom has shifted in certain ways. It was initially
more liberal than democratic, for example. I will take as my own
yardstick the US's later-developing commitment to both liberalism and
democracy in the shape of liberal democracy, though the democracy and
rights elements will be addressed separately in my demonstration of US
theory-practice discrepancy. Some of what the American creed has come to
include will not be drawn into my demonstration, above all the belief in
the intimate connection between democracy and markets.8 While America's
positive moral evaluation of capitalism may help explain its Cold War
prioritisation of anti-leftism over democracy (I return to this later),
I will not document inconsistencies in US practice with respect to
marketadvocacy (such as President Bush's recent steel tariffs, now
rescinded, and his farm subsidies). My concern here is with America's
(in)consistency as a promoter of liberal and democratic principles
outside the realm of economic exchange. Radical democrats have long
criticised as thinly formalistic the model of democracy operative in the
US and elsewhere in the West. Recently they have taken the US to task
for promoting a similarly 'low-intensity' or 'polyarchic' model of
democracy abroad. This model, these radicals argue, privileges free
elections over social equality, economic democracy and popular
participation.9 I will make some critical remarks of my own about the
quality of domestic American democracy. My focus in respect of US
foreign policy, however, will be on flagrant breaches of democratic and
human rights values. While the practice of elitist democracy is arguably
hypocritical for a country that trumpets its democratic superiority, it
is not obvious that in operating or exporting polyarchy the US is
breaching publicly affirmed values. It is against US support for
authoritarian and crudely oppressive forces that the charge of hypocrisy
is most readily laid. Instances of the latter predominate in the charge
sheet that follows. It should be acknowledged that if the US does not
always promote liberty and democracy, nor does it always preach them.
Influential American 'realists' have insisted that global relationships
are necessarily governed by the interplay of selfinterested states.
While differing in their prescriptions for the US -- for example, on
whether it should be cautious or aggressive abroad -- they have shared a
scepticism about universalistic schemes for promoting democracy and
rights.10 To the extent that realism has prevailed in American foreign
policy counsel, some might argue, the charge of hypocrisy is irrelevant,
since realists do not pretend to virtue in the first place[. I concede
something to this point: the hypocrisy charge sticks better to the more
preachy American politicians.]{.underline} Still, a manipulative realist
might feign belief in liberal-democratic values the better to advance
American interests, and that would count as hypocrisy.11 More
importantly, [the realist strand in US foreign policymaking has not
prevented a considerable continuity in US public advocacy of freedom and
democracy, whether sincerely meant or not.]{.underline} That fact is
sufficient to establish one of the coordinates of the hypocrisy charge:
that America preaches certain principles at home and abroad. The realist
strand in American foreign policy is usefully juxtaposed to another that
sets up the US rather well for moral consideration: the religious.
Powerful biblical religious impulses run through American public
culture. These lend a Manichaean cast to many US foreign policy
pronouncements.12 Presidents like Wilson and G. W. Bush have appeared to
view the US as divinely chosen to battle global evil[. In its advocacy
of freedom and democracy the US thus sometimes literally seems to
preach.]{.underline}
