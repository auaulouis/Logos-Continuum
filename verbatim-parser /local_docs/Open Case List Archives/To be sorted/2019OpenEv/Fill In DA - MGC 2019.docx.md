**[The Trump Administration is hoping to]{.underline}** **[boost the
export prospects]{.underline}** **[for American weapons
systems]{.underline}** to allied countries by modifying policies and
streamlining the bureaucratic process. The Trump Administration
announced a revised conventional arms transfer policy in April, but that
is just the first step. There are more policy changes coming down the
line. "The new policy reflects the priorities of the president's
National Security Strategy," Ambassador Tina Kaidanow, Acting Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, said on Aug. 8 at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Which are, namely, to
preserve peace through strength by reforming regulations to facilitate
the exports of U.S. military equipment; to strengthen partners and
allies; to facilitate U.S. economic security and innovation." Under the
new policy, **[the United States hopes to make its export bureaucracy
more proactive and cut red tape in the process]{.underline}**. "These
steps are among the first in what we hope will be a series of efforts to
streamline the arms transfer process," Kaidanow said. "I can assure you
that my colleagues and I at the State Department, but also again more
broadly in the USG, will continue exploring ways to cut red tape and
give U.S. industry every advantage in an increasingly competitive global
marketplace, while continuing to ensure the responsible export of arms."
**[The United States is making these policy changes with]{.underline}**
**[great power competition with China and Russia]{.underline}** **[in
mind]{.underline}**. **["We're trying to improve our ability to compete
with our adversaries by providing our partners with viable alternatives
to foreign products in order to maintain influence in key regions
throughout the world,"]{.underline}** Laura Cressey, Deputy Director for
Regional Security and Arms Transfers at U.S. Department of State, said.
"We're going to be working with our partners and allies to identify
critical capability requirements that they have and then trying to
expedite transfers to support these essential foreign policy and
national security objectives." However, writing the policy guidance is
the easy part. Implementing the policy will be far more challenging.
**["The release of the new policy was only the first step]{.underline}**
**[in a series of what we believe will be very practical results-focused
initiatives to transform the way that the U.S. government works to
support and]{.underline}** **[grow our defense industrial
base]{.underline}**," Kaidanow said. "Through that memorandum, the
president also directed the secretary of state, in coordination with the
secretaries of defense, commerce, and energy, to submit an
implementation plan within 60 days." As part of the effort, the United
States is looking at reforming export hurdles such as the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations, which has been a vexing problem for the
defense industry for decades. "We'll look at streamlining the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, and also continuing
to revise the U.S. Munitions List and the Commerce Control List,"
Cressey said. Additionally, **[the State Department and Defense
Department will try to speed up the bureaucratic processes involved in
weapons exports]{.underline}**. "We will also be looking at the
day-to-day processes to ensure that we are as efficient, as streamlined,
and as effective as possible," Cressey said. "So some of the things that
we're looking at, and that folks in industry and associations have asked
us to look at, is: establishing milestones and timelines for the foreign
military sales process; improving and speeding up our contracting
process -- processes within the Defense Department; trying to increase
the competitiveness of U.S. defense items and systems by building in
exportability to the design and development; and also by expanding
support for what we call non-program-of-record systems. **[We're looking
into potential financing options that could]{.underline}** **[make our
systems more attainable]{.underline}** **[for our foreign
partners]{.underline}**. And we're also examining existing polices to
ensure that they don't unnecessarily detract from our ability to compete
in international -- in the international marketplace." **[Without the
changes]{.underline}**, **[the United States is]{.underline}**
**[increasingly in danger]{.underline}** **[of losing its market share
as China]{.underline}**, in particular, **[increasing develops and
produces evermore-capable weapons for the export market]{.underline}**.
One example is the Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) market, which the
United States dominates, but which is also threatened by Chinese
competition and by Washington's tight export regulations. **["By
removing some of the previous administration's artificial barriers to
the transfer of arms to critical partners]{.underline}**, the UAS export
policy being one example, **[this administration is both strengthening
our hand in the ongoing strategic competition while also stimulating
economic growth at home]{.underline}**, as well as job creation," Alex
Gray, Special Assistant to the President for the Defense Industrial
Base, said. "It should be noted that the **[U.S. aerospace and defense
industries contribute almost \$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy
and they support about 2.5 million American jobs]{.underline}**. Just as
one point, the international -- UAS export market alone is estimated to
be worth more than \$50 billion a year within the next decade. Those are
the stakes we're competing for." **[Those nations that are unable to
purchase American weapons could find that China or Russia]{.underline}**
**[are]{.underline}** **[more than willing]{.underline}** **[to supply
them with]{.underline}** **[comparable systems]{.underline}**. **["We
are witnessing China]{.underline}** -- as an example, not alone -- but
China **[filling voids the U.S. left with a denial to a friend or
ally]{.underline}**," Keith Webster, president of the Defense and
Aerospace Export Council at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said. **["The
consequence of a denial filled by China or others is]{.underline}** as
follows: **[The U.S. loses market share that is not easily recaptured,
and in some cases will never be recaptured. The U.S. loses control of
the capability. The U.S. loses the opportunity to train, influence, and
maintain a military relationship with foreign forces, who now are
introducing into their inventory a Chinese]{.underline}** -- Korean,
Israeli, et cetera -- **[capability]{.underline}**." **[There
are]{.underline}** some **[immediate examples]{.underline}** that
Webster said he could point to. **["We never answered India's request
for ballistic missile defense]{.underline}** capability." "That ask of
the U.S. went unanswered for a number of years. **[And now,
India]{.underline}** has been forced to consider and has -- **[may
potentially go buy]{.underline}**, potentially, **[the Russian S-400
system]{.underline}**. Similar to what Turkey's buying---or said they
were going to buy. **[Now we are rushing to put together a proposal for
BMD for India to counter that situation]{.underline}**."

#### Failure to contain China and Russia sparks warfighting and nuclear proliferation that results in extinction

Michael **Mandelbaum** (Christian A. Herter Professor Emeritus of
American Foreign Policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies) March/April **2019** \["The New Containment"
Foreign Affairs. Mar/Apr2019, Vol. 98 Issue 2, p123-131. 9p, loghry\]

**[The weakest link in the chain may be the most powerful
country]{.underline}** itself. There are reasons to expect the American
public to support a leading role in the **[containment of Russia,
China]{.underline}**, and Iran. The United States has a long history
with such a foreign policy. The approach **[has geopolitical logic
behind it, promising to protect American interests in crucial parts of
the world]{.underline}** at a reasonable price. But there are also
reasons for skepticism. Today's threats appear less urgent, coping with
them will be more complicated, and the country's attitude toward foreign
entanglements has understandably soured over the last two decades. The
United States was pulled into both world wars by external attacks, and
Americans gave their support to a foreign policy of global reach during
the Cold War because they were persuaded it would head off yet another
world war. After the Soviet collapse, many of the Cold War arrangements
persisted through inertia and gained support because they seemed to
entail little expense or risk. Now that the expenses and risks of such a
policy have increased, many Americans may reconsider their support. The
skepticism has deepened because of the county's recent misadventures
abroad. The interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya turned out
poorly, and the public has little taste for more. This view has much to
recommend it. But it need not threaten the prospects of a new
containment, because that course is quite different from the failed
crusades of recent decades. Those involved efforts to transform the
internal politics and economies of weak states. Containment involves the
opposite, checking the external conduct of strong states. If national
leaders can appreciate and explain the difference, they may be able to
bring the public along. The resurgence of populism, finally, makes any
such project more difficult. The essence of populism is hostility to
elites, and the design and conduct of foreign policy are elite
activities. The foreign policy establishment favors a robust American
role in the world. That may be a good enough reason for
antiestablishment rebels, including the populist in chief now residing
in the White House, to oppose one. So the future direction of American
foreign policy is unclear. **[Washington might forgo leading coalitions
to contain]{.underline}** the three **[revisionist powers, in which
case]{.underline}** **[their strength will increase]{.underline}**.
**[Emboldened by the American abdication, they may]{.underline}**
**[grow aggressive]{.underline}** **[and try to]{.underline}** **[coerce
their neighbors]{.underline}**. **[Those neighbors currently rely on the
American nuclear arsenal to protect them; if they come to doubt the
credibility of American security guarantees, they may follow Israel and
opt to develop or acquire their own arsenals in order to protect
themselves. An American retreat would thus make the world]{.underline}**
**[more dangerous]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[nuclear
proliferation more likely]{.underline}**. Thanks to the size, geography,
and power of the United States, Americans for many generations have been
able to pay less attention to American foreign policy than have the
citizens of other countries, whose lives and fortunes that policy has
more immediately and directly affected. **[Should the country turn
decisively away from its global role and allow the revisionist
challenges to advance unchecked]{.underline}**, however, **[Americans'
happy detachment from the world beyond their borders may disappear. And
by the time they realize what they need to protect, it may
be]{.underline}** **[too late]{.underline}** to do so
**[without]{.underline}** great difficulty and **[high
cost]{.underline}**.©

**[The best way to avoid great power clashes is to make the U.S.
position clear from the outset]{.underline}**. That position should be
that the United States welcomes competition of a certain kind. Great
powers compete across multiple planes---economic, ideological, and
political, as well as military. **[Competition in most spheres
is]{.underline}** necessary and even **[healthy]{.underline}**. Within
the liberal order, China can compete economically and successfully with
the United States; Russia can thrive in the international economic order
upheld by the liberal powers, even if it is not itself liberal. **[But
security competition is different]{.underline}**. **[The security
situation undergirds]{.underline}** **[everything else]{.underline}**.
It remains true today as it has since the Second World War that **[only
the United States has the capacity and the unique geographical
advantages to provide]{.underline}** **[global security]{.underline}**.
**[There is no stable balance of power in Europe or Asia without the
United States]{.underline}**. And while we can talk about soft power and
smart power, they have been and always will be of limited value when
confronting raw military power. Despite all of the loose talk of
American decline, **[it is in the military realm where U.S. advantages
remain clearest. Even in other great powers' backyards, the United
States retains the capacity, along with its powerful allies, to deter
challenges to the security order]{.underline}**. But **[without a U.S.
willingness to use military power to establish balance in far-flung
regions of the world, the system will]{.underline}** **[buckle under the
unrestrained military competition]{.underline}** **[of regional
powers]{.underline}**.

#### Cessation of sales to Saudi Arabia wrecks relations and causes Russian and Chinese diversification, locking the United States out of the region

loghry\]

In sum, **[more restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or
outright embargos are unlikely to succeed in policy
coercion]{.underline}**. **[While arms transfers provide an avenue of
influence, embargos often]{.underline}** **[lead to
diversification]{.underline}**, **[not desired policy
changes]{.underline}**. Additionally, fears of technology transfer and
direct offsets creating a competitor out of every client are generally
unfounded in the high-end market in which the United States generally
deals. Finally, while the large domestic market provides the United
States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political
influence, sometimes economics do matter, particularly when it comes to
saving a production line for future flexibility. These conclusions
should therefore inform U.S. policy on Saudi Arabia. The intent here is
not to argue the moral or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in
responding to Saudi Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the
war in Yemen. It is natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and want
to take any actions necessary to stop it. However, **[I ultimately argue
against a Saudi embargo.]{.underline}** This is not because, as the
president has argued, it might cost a few billion dollars and some
hundreds of defense industry jobs. As others have pointed out, the
economic impact of Saudi arms purchases on the U.S. defense industry is
relatively small. Rather, **[embargoing Saudi Arabia is unlikely to
fundamentally alter Saudi policies, but likely to further damage U.S.
ties with Riyadh]{.underline}**. **[In the near-term, Saudi Arabia can
substitute other weapons]{.underline}**, such as the Eurofighter and
Tornado, and "dumb bombs" **[instead of U.S.-built "smart weapons." The
Saudis can also rely more heavily on their Emirati and Egyptian partners
using non-U.S. produced arms. In the medium to long term, such an
embargo is likely to push the Kingdom to]{.underline}** **[greater arms
diversification]{.underline}**. If history is any guide, **[the United
States will eventually lift any potential arms embargo with little
change in Saudi behavior, but only after having provided an opportunity
for adversary states such as]{.underline}** **[Russia and
China]{.underline}** **[to gain a strategic foothold in
Riyadh]{.underline}**. Some might counter that it would be extremely
difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis to
significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case. However, costly does not mean
impossible. Less wealthy states have already done it. Egypt is one
example above; but others such as Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait ---
frustrated at years of U.S. approval delays --- have significantly
diversified their arms acquisitions. In other words, **[with the money
and options available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a
stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the
Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions over time
in response to a U.S. embargo]{.underline}**. Thus, while **[a U.S.
embargo]{.underline}** might be morally compelling and emotionally
satisfying, it **[is unlikely to create meaningful change for those most
at risk or be strategically beneficial to the United
States]{.underline}**. In the absence of a compelling, evidence-based
case that an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia might produce desired changes
in behavior, policymakers should look elsewhere for solutions to their
Saudi problems.

#### Losing power competition with China and Russia risks collapsing the global order

Michael **Mandelbaum** (Christian A. Herter Professor Emeritus of
American Foreign Policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies) March/April **2019** \["The New Containment"
Foreign Affairs. Mar/Apr2019, Vol. 98 Issue 2, p123-131. 9p, loghry\]

The quarter century following the Cold War was the most peaceful in
modern history. The world's strongest powers did not fight one another
or even think much about doing so. They did not, on the whole, prepare
for war, anticipate war, or conduct negotiations and political maneuvers
with the prospect of war looming in the background. **[As U.S. global
military hegemony persisted, the possibility of developed nations
fighting one another seemed ever more remote.]{.underline}** Then
history began to change course. In the last several years, three
**[powers have launched active efforts to revise security arrangements
in their respective regions. Russia has invaded Crimea]{.underline}**
and other parts of Ukraine and has tried covertly to destabilize
European democracies. **[China has built artificial island fortresses in
international waters,]{.underline}** claimed vast swaths of the western
Pacific, and moved to organize Eurasia economically in ways favorable to
Beijing. And the Islamic Republic of Iran has expanded its influence
over much of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen and is pursuing nuclear
weapons. **[This new world requires a new American foreign
policy]{.underline}**. Fortunately, the country's own not-so-distant
past can offer guidance. During the Cold War, the United States chose to
contain the Soviet Union, successfully deterring its military aggression
and limiting its political influence for decades. **[The United States
should apply containment once again, now to Russia,
China]{.underline}**, and Iran. The contemporary world is similar enough
to its mid-twentieth-century predecessor to make that old strategy
relevant but different enough that it needs to be modified and updated.
While success is not guaranteed, a new containment policy offers the
best chance to defend American interests in the twenty-first century.
Now as before, the possibility of armed conflict exerts a major
influence on the foreign policies of the United States and countries
throughout Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The Cold War divided the
world into rival camps, with regions and even countries split in two.
Today, similar cleavages are developing, with each revisionist power
seeking its own sphere of influence separate from the larger U.S.-backed
global order. Now as before, **[the revisionist powers are dictatorships
that challenge]{.underline}** American values as well as **[American
interests. They seek to overturn political, military, and economic
arrangements the United States helped establish]{.underline}** long ago
and has supported ever since. **[Should]{.underline}** Vladimir Putin's
**[Russia succeed in reasserting control over parts of the former Soviet
Union]{.underline}**, Xi Jinping's **[China gain control over maritime
commerce in the western Pacific]{.underline}**, or Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei's Iran dominate the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf, **[the
United States, its allies, and the global order they uphold would suffer
a]{.underline}** **[major blow]{.underline}**.

However, it is the two great powers, **[China and Russia]{.underline}**,
that **[pose the greatest challenge to the]{.underline}** relatively
peaceful and prosperous **[international order created and sustained by
the United States. If they were to accomplish their aims of establishing
hegemony in their desired spheres of influence, the world would return
to the condition it was in at the end of the 19th century,
with]{.underline}** **[competing great powers clashing]{.underline}**
**[over]{.underline}** inevitably intersecting and **[overlapping
spheres of interest]{.underline}**. **[These were the]{.underline}**
unsettled, disordered **[conditions that produced the fertile ground for
the]{.underline}** two destructive **[world wars]{.underline}** of the
first half of the 20th century. The collapse of the British-dominated
world order on the oceans, the disruption of the uneasy balance of power
on the European continent due to the rise of a powerful unified Germany,
combined with the rise of Japanese power in East Asia all contributed to
a highly competitive international environment in which dissatisfied
great powers took the opportunity to pursue their ambitions in the
absence of any power or group of powers to unite in checking them.
**[The result was an unprecedented global calamity]{.underline}**. **[It
has been the great accomplishment of the U.S.-led world order in the 70
years since the end of the Second World War that this kind of
competition has been held in check and great power conflicts have been
avoided]{.underline}**. **[The role of the United States]{.underline}**,
however, **[has been critical]{.underline}**. Until recently, **[the
dissatisfied great and medium-size powers have faced]{.underline}**
considerable and indeed almost **[insuperable obstacles to achieving
their objectives. The chief obstacle has been the power]{.underline}**
and coherence **[of the order itself]{.underline}** and of its principal
promoter and defender. The American-led system of political and military
alliances, especially in the two critical regions of Europe and East
Asia, has presented China and Russia with what Dean Acheson once
referred to as "situations of strength" in their regions that have
required them to pursue their ambitions cautiously and in most respects
to defer serious efforts to disrupt the international system. The system
has served as a check on their ambitions in both positive and negative
ways. They have been participants in and for the most part beneficiaries
of the open international economic system the United States created and
helped sustain and, so long as that system was functioning, have had
more to gain by playing in it than by challenging and overturning it.
The same cannot be said of the political and strategic aspects of the
order, both of which have worked to their detriment. The growth and
vibrancy of democratic government in the two decades following the
collapse of Soviet communism have posed a continual threat to the
ability of rulers in Beijing and Moscow to maintain control, and since
the end of the Cold War they have regarded every advance of democratic
institutions, including especially the geographical advance close to
their borders, as an existential threat---and with reason. The continual
threat to the basis of their rule posed by the U.S.-supported order has
made them hostile both to the order and to the United States. However,
it has also been a source of weakness and vulnerability. Chinese rulers
in particular have had to worry about what an unsuccessful confrontation
with the United States might do to their sources of legitimacy at home.
And although Vladimir Putin has to some extent used a calculated foreign
adventurism to maintain his hold on domestic power, he has taken a more
cautious approach when met with determined U.S. and European opposition,
as in the case of Ukraine, and pushed forward, as in Syria, only when
invited to do so by U.S. and Western passivity. Autocratic rulers in a
liberal democratic world have had to be careful. **[The greatest check
on Chinese and Russian ambitions]{.underline}**, however, **[has come
from the combined military power of the United States and its allies in
Europe and Asia]{.underline}**. **[China]{.underline}**, although
increasingly powerful itself, **[has had to contemplate facing the
combined military strength of the world's superpower]{.underline}** and
some very formidable regional powers linked by alliance or common
strategic interest, including Japan, India, and South Korea, as well as
smaller but still potent nations like Vietnam and Australia. **[Russia
has had to face the United States and its NATO allies]{.underline}**.
**[When united, these military powers present a daunting challenge to a
revisionist power that can call on no allies]{.underline}** of its own
for assistance. Even were the Chinese to score an early victory in a
conflict, they would have to contend over time with the combined
industrial productive capacities of some of the world's richest and most
technologically advanced nations. A weaker Russia would face an even
greater challenge. **[Faced with these obstacles, the two great
powers]{.underline}**, as well as the lesser dissatisfied powers,
**[have had to hope for or if possible engineer a]{.underline}**
**[weakening of the U.S.-supported world order]{.underline}** from
within. This could come about either by separating the United States
from its allies, raising doubts about the U.S. commitment to defend its
allies militarily in the event of a conflict, or by various means wooing
American allies out from within the liberal world order's strategic
structure. For most of the past decade, the reaction of American allies
to greater aggressiveness on the part of China and Russia in their
respective regions, and to Iran in the Middle East, has been to seek
more reassurance from the United States. Russian actions in Georgia,
Ukraine, and Syria; Chinese actions in the East and South China seas;
Iranian actions in Syria, Iraq, and along the littoral of the Persian
Gulf---all have led to calls by American allies and partners for a
greater commitment. In this respect, the system has worked as it was
supposed to. What the political scientist William Wohlforth once
described as the inherent stability of the unipolar order reflected this
dynamic---as dissatisfied regional powers sought to challenge the status
quo, their alarmed neighbors turned to the distant American superpower
to contain their ambitions. The system has depended, however, on will,
capacity, and coherence at the heart of the liberal world order. **[The
United States had to be willing and able to play its part as the
principal guarantor of the order, especially in the military and
strategic realm]{.underline}**. The order's ideological and economic
core---the democracies of Europe and East Asia and the Pacific---had to
remain relatively healthy and relatively confident. In such
circumstances, **[the combined political, economic, and military power
of the liberal world would be too great to be seriously challenged by
the great powers, much less by the smaller dissatisfied
powers]{.underline}**.

**[The rivalry between America and China has seen both sides step up
international arms sales]{.underline}** and transfers as they seek to
strengthen military ties with key allies, according to a report
published on Monday. The study by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), which examined the volume of international
transfers of major weapons between 2008 and 2017, showed **[China's arms
exports represented 5.7 per cent of the world's share of arms
exports]{.underline}** between 2013-17 -- **[up by more than a
third]{.underline}** from the 4.6 per cent recorded between 2008-12. The
report was published a week after China unveiled an 8.1 per cent
increase in military spending over a three-year period, although China's
state media defended the rise as proportionate and low, adding that it
would not lead to an arms race with the United States. **[The
administration of]{.underline}** US President Donald **[Trump has dubbed
China as a "rival"]{.underline}**, and **[the latest SIPRI report shows
how the US has used arms transfers as a foreign policy tool to offset
Beijing's growing influence]{.underline}**. For example, **[US arms
deliveries to India grew by 557 per cent between 2008 and 2017, the year
China and India became embroiled in a protracted border
dispute]{.underline}** over the Doklam region in the Himalayas. "This
development is part of the growing strategic partnership between the two
countries under which the USA has begun to supply India with advanced
military equipment," the report said. 'No arms race with US': China
defends military spending rise as low **[The US has also started to
increase its security cooperation with Vietnam, which is embroiled in a
dispute with Beijing over the South China Sea]{.underline}**. In 2017 it
delivered one patrol ship, the USS Morgenthau, to Vietnam -- the first
major US arms transfer to that country. Tensions between China and Japan
in the East China Sea also saw Japan moving closer to the US, the report
said. It said Tokyo turned to the US for several types of advanced
weapons between 2013 and 2017, including the first batches of a total of
42 combat aircraft. Japan also ordered advanced air and missile defence
systems from the US in the same period. But **[in cases where US
relations with other countries had deteriorated the result was a fall in
arms transfers]{.underline}**. For example, the report said that
**[Venezuela, which once relied on the US as its main arms supplier, had
rebuilt its armed forces with]{.underline}** **[weapons from
China]{.underline}** and Russia **[after ties with Washington
soured]{.underline}** following the Hugo Chavez's election as president

**[Even though the Chinese defense industry is "pretty monolithic" there
is a "lot of competition inside each sector,"]{.underline}** Bitzinger
said. As an example, within AVIC, there are two major combat builders,
Shenyang and Chengdu, and "they frequently compete with aircraft
projects, such as the J-8 vs. J-10 and J-20 vs. J-31." This is China's
traditional approach to reducing the technological risks caused by the
weakness of the domestic industrial base, Kashin said, which has a
history of simultaneously developing two systems. Kashin said that the
first one would be a high-risk project, usually expensive, innovative
and involving imported components. The second, a less ambitious low risk
project suits the minimal requirements of the PLA, which can be
accomplished without external help. As a result, the PLA would get the
new systems even if the external supply chain is disrupted or the
project fails. Even if the propagation of so many weapons is a
calculated government strategy or evidence that the military-industrial
complex has "run amok," it has potential to cause chaos on the
international scene, said Robert Haddick at the Mitchell Institute for
Aerospace Studies, Air Force Association. Top **[Chinese]{.underline}**
government **[leaders see themselves in competition with the United
States for influence in key countries around the world. They see the
large U.S. presence in arms exports to vital countries in Africa, Asia,
Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, as a form of U.S. global
influence that China needs to counter]{.underline}**, he said. **[If
China displaces the United States as the preferred arms supplier that
would shift economic and diplomatic influence from Washington to
Beijing. China's military industry might think it is "mature enough to
take on the U.S. defense industry and prevail,"]{.underline}** Haddick
said. Chris Pocock, another Zhuhai Airshow veteran and UK-based
aerospace specialist, said **[the Chinese have no moral scruples about
exporting to renegade, corrupt and unstable states that the West will
not supply. China is a dream for despots, as China provides "low
acquisition costs and, of course, cheap loans."]{.underline}** Giarra
believes that **[China is in a "race with the United States and the rest
of the world."]{.underline}** In the past, this would have been known as
an arms race, but it really does take some competition for it to be a
race, he said.

**[So what is left? Waning empires. Religious revivals. Incipient
anarchy. A coming retreat into fortified cities. These are the Dark Age
experiences that a world without a hyperpower might quickly find itself
reliving. The trouble is, of course, that this Dark Age would be an
altogether more dangerous one than the Dark Age of the ninth century.
For the world is much more populous]{.underline}**---roughly 20 times
more---**[so friction between the world\'s disparate "tribes" is bound
to be more frequent. Technology has transformed production; now human
societies depend not merely on freshwater and the harvest but also on
supplies of fossil fuels that are known to be finite. Technology has
upgraded destruction, too, so it is now possible not just to sack a city
but to obliterate it.]{.underline}** For more than two decades,
globalization---the integration of world markets for commodities, labor,
and capital---has raised living standards throughout the world, except
where countries have shut themselves off from the process through
tyranny or civil war. **[The reversal of globalization---which a new
Dark Age would produce---would certainly lead to economic stagnation and
even depression.]{.underline}** As **[the United States]{.underline}**
sought to protect itself after a second September 11 devastates, say,
Houston or Chicago, it **[would inevitably become a less open society,
less hospitable for foreigners seeking to work, visit, or do
business.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, as Europe\'s Muslim enclaves grew,
Islamist extremists\' infiltration of the EU would become irreversible,
increasing trans-Atlantic tensions over the Middle East to the breaking
point. An economic meltdown in China would plunge the Communist system
into crisis, unleashing the centrifugal forces that undermined previous
Chinese empires. Western investors would lose out and conclude that
lower returns at home are preferable to the risks of default abroad.
**[The worst effects of the new Dark Age would be felt on the edges of
the waning great powers. The wealthiest ports of the global
economy]{.underline}**---from New York to Rotterdam to
Shanghai---**[would become the targets of plunderers and pirates. With
ease, terrorists could disrupt the freedom of the seas, targeting oil
tankers, aircraft carriers, and cruise liners, while Western nations
frantically concentrated on making their airports secure. Meanwhile,
limited nuclear wars could devastate numerous regions, beginning in the
Korean peninsula and Kashmir, perhaps ending catastrophically in the
Middle East. In Latin America, wretchedly poor citizens would seek
solace in Evangelical Christianity imported by U.S. religious orders. In
Africa, the great plagues of AIDS and malaria would continue their
deadly work. The few remaining solvent airlines would simply suspend
services to many cities in these continents; who would wish to leave
their privately guarded safe havens to go there? For all these reasons,
the prospect of an apolar world should frighten us today a great deal
more than it frightened the heirs of Charlemagne. If the United States
retreats from global hegemony]{.underline}**---its fragile self-image
dented by minor setbacks on the imperial frontier---**[its critics at
home and abroad must not pretend that they are ushering in a new era of
multipolar harmony, or even a return to the good old balance of
power.]{.underline}** Be careful what you wish for. **[The alternative
to unipolarity]{.underline}** would not be multipolarity at all. It
**[would be apolarity---a global vacuum of power. And far more dangerous
forces than rival great powers would benefit from such a not-so-new
world disorder.]{.underline}**

**[U.S. restraint also limits the spread of technology, which dampens
global arms races and slows the spread of dangerous advanced weapons
technology, which will eventually diffuse to American adversaries. And
of course, it prevents the emergence of competitors, which makes good
economic sense]{.underline}** as well. Historically, the United States
has practiced "unilateral restraint" by foregoing exporting its
highest-capability weapons to a region until a viable competing product
emerges; for example, refusing to deliver advanced medium-range
air-to-air missiles to Asian states until China purchased the Russian
equivalent R-77. More broadly, the United States, more than any other
exporter, jealously guards against the spread of weapons know-how even
to its closest allies (often arms exporters themselves). **[A case in
point is Turkey's effort to acquire foreign long-range air and
anti-missile defense systems, hoping to acquire the underlying
technology and eventually become a major arms exporter itself. The
U.S.-made Patriot system was eliminated from consideration because most
of its technology would not be given to Turkey. Announcing the ultimate
deal with Russia, Turkey's presidential spokesman was frank: "The price
difference could have been manageable. But the issue of technology
transfer was more important. On this issue, our allies, including the
United States, caused a big disappointment." The United States, again
because of its market power, can afford this restraint in order to
maintain its global technological dominance]{.underline}**.

### 2nc -- Russia Impact Pivot

#### Russia is revisionist, and only credible deterrence solves

**Satter '16** - senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a fellow of
the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies,
visiting professor @ U of I-Champaign (David, "Trump and Russia,"
*National Review*,
<https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/08/donald-trump-russia-policy-dangerously-na-ve-about-vladimir-putin/>)

Trump has indicated that he is open to lifting sanctions against Russia
imposed after the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine and to cooperating
with Russia in Syria, ostensibly against the Islamic State. He has
suggested that the NATO alliance is passé and that, if elected, he would
not necessary abide by the U.S. commitment under NATO to defend the
Baltic republics. Trump's Russia policy, however, has no chance of
leading to an improvement in relations between the U.S. and Russia or to
greater world stability. The reason is that although the U.S. wants
Russia as a friend, **[Russia's leaders need the U.S. as an
enemy]{.underline}**. **[Only in this way, can the anger of the Russian
people be directed against the West]{.underline}** instead of against
them. The **[leaders of post-Soviet Russia use wars to achieve internal
political objectives]{.underline}**. **[The first Chechen war was "a
small victorious war" that was calculated to raise the popularity
of]{.underline}** President Boris **[Yeltsin]{.underline}**, which fell
because of the suffering caused by market "reforms" in the 1990s. **[The
second Chechen war was started to save]{.underline}** the
**[Yeltsin]{.underline}** entourage **[from prison]{.underline}** or
worse **[and assure Vladimir Putin's rise to power. Four apartment
buildings in Buinaksk, Moscow, and Volgodonsk were blown up in 1999,
killing 300 people; the attack was blamed on Chechen terrorists. In
fact, there is overwhelming evidence that the bombings were carried out
by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB]{.underline}**), the
successor to the Soviet-era KGB. This evidence includes the fact that
FSB agents were caught after placing a bomb in a fifth building in
Ryazan southeast of Moscow and that Gennady Seleznev, the speaker of the
Russian Duma, announced the bombing in Volgodonsk on September 16, 1999
--- three days before it occurred. **[The bombings were used to justify
a new invasion of Chechnya and success in that war brought Putin to
power]{.underline}**. In other words, **[there is overwhelming evidence
that Putin rules as a result of an act of terror against his own
people.]{.underline}** The leaders of post-Soviet Russia use wars to
achieve internal political objectives. **[The war in Ukraine was also a
diversion.]{.underline}** It was **[launched to distract the Russian
people from]{.underline}** the lessons of **[the Maidan
revolt]{.underline}** in Ukraine, specifically that it is possible for a
people to organize spontaneously and overthrow a kleptocratic regime.
**[The war in Syria]{.underline}**, in turn, **[was undertaken in order
to distract attention from the lack of success in
Ukraine]{.underline}**. The ambitious plans to carve out a "New Russia"
from sovereign Ukrainian territory were at least temporarily frozen in
the face of Western sanctions and stiff Ukrainian military resistance.
**[Trump's call]{.underline}** for a grand bargain with Russia is
therefore naïve and misguided. It **[will not inspire Russia to
cooperate with the U.S. for the common good but instead serve as an open
invitation to further aggression with potentially serious
consequences]{.underline}**. **[The following are a few]{.underline}**
of them: **[Ukraine]{.underline}**: At the present time, Russian troops
are massing in areas of occupied Crimea adjacent to mainland Ukraine.
The Ukrainians expect an offensive by the Russian Army at any time.
Meanwhile, the Ukrainians report that the Russian-separatist forces in
eastern Ukraine on August 8 attacked Ukrainian army positions 61 times
in 24 hours. The Russian-separatist army, built up by Russia on
Ukrainian territory, consists of an estimated 40,000 fighters --- 12,000
of whom are regular Russian troops. Leadership and coordination are
provided by Russia. This force is equipped with multiple rocket
launchers, anti-aircraft systems, and more tanks than many members of
NATO. It is supported by another 50,000 Russian troops stationed just
over the border on the Russian side. There has been a lull in the
fighting in recent months which removed Ukraine from the world's
headlines. But **[statements by U.S. politicians that undermine faith in
the American will to react to aggression will encourage the Putin regime
to intensify its efforts to destabilize Ukraine]{.underline}** with a
new offensive whether Trump is elected or not. The
**[Baltics]{.underline}**: **[Russia cannot defeat the U.S. or NATO in
an all-out war but it has strategic superiority in the Baltics where it
could provoke a conflict]{.underline}** and then threaten to use nuclear
weapons, **[presenting NATO with a choice of escalation or backing
down]{.underline}**. **[The Russians are clearly ready to take
risks]{.underline}**. On April 14, **[a Russian]{.underline}** SU-27
**[fighter]{.underline}** jet **[flew]{.underline}** dangerously close
to a U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea. It came
**[within 50 feet of]{.underline}** the **[American plane and conducted
a barrel roll]{.underline}** starting from the left side of the
aircraft, going over the aircraft, and ending up on the aircraft's
right. **[This incident came two days after a simulated]{.underline}**
Russian **[aerial assault against the]{.underline}** guided-missile
destroyer **[USS Donald Cook]{.underline}** in the Baltic Sea. One of
the **[jets flew within 30 feet]{.underline}** of the warship. **[This
was the most reckless flyover]{.underline}** of an American ship by a
Russian jet **[since the Cold War]{.underline}**. The **[Russians
are]{.underline}** clearly **[ready to take risks]{.underline}**. **[The
Russian leaders are not fanatics]{.underline}**. The effort that they
have invested in amassing personal fortunes attests to this. **[They
will not risk their hold on power on behalf of a conflict they know they
will lose. But they could miscalculate, which is why statements such as
Trump's that question U.S. treaty commitments are likely to invite a
crisis rather than avoid one.]{.underline}** **[Indiscriminate
violence]{.underline}**: **[The Russian authorities act with a complete
disregard for human life. In Syria, the Russian bombing is
indiscriminate]{.underline}**. According to the Violations Documentation
Center, which seeks to document the attacks by all sides, the civilian
death toll from Russian strikes in six months until mid-March was over
2,000. In January, according the Syria Network for Human Rights, another
monitoring organization, Russian air strikes killed 679 civilians. This
exceeded the number of civilians killed during that period by the Syrian
Army, which is also guilty of indiscriminate bombing, as well as by ISIS
(98 killed) and the al-Nusra Front (42 killed). **[In light of the
dangers that the present Russian regime represents, what matters is
deterrence]{.underline}**. The bombing of civilian targets in Syria,
including bakeries and hospitals, also increases the flow of refugees
toward Turkey and Europe, exacerbating internal tensions in those
regions and creating pressure to accept a resolution of the Syrian
crisis on Russian terms. Americans have not been immune to Russian
aggression. An American was among the victims when on July 17, 2014,
Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine killing
all 298 persons on board. The Dutch Safety Board confirmed that MH17 was
destroyed by a missile fired from a Russian made BUK anti-aircraft
battery. The Putin regime, in complete disregard for the safety of
innocent international air travelers, had transferred missiles capable
of shooting down planes flying at over 30,000 feet to a quickly
assembled army fighting in an area traversed by one of the busiest
commercial air corridors in the world. There was also an American
victim, Sandy Booker of Oklahoma, in the 2002 Moscow theater siege in
which the Russian authorities flooded a theater with lethal gas. In all
cases, the Russian leaders will respect civilian lives, including those
of Americans, only to the degree that they fear that they may be called
to account. If an American leader like **[Trump]{.underline}** responds
to reports of Russian crimes by saying, "we kill plenty of people too,"
he **[is removing what little restraint Russians are likely to exercise
in military conflicts and increasing the risks to uninvolved Americans
as well]{.underline}**. COMMENTS Trump has expressed concern for Putin's
attitude for him. He said that he believes that Trump respects him and
wonders if Putin likes him, as if this was in some way relevant. Carter
Page, an adviser to Trump on Russia policy, blamed the tensions between
the U.S. and Russia on the "often hypocritical focus on ideas such as
democratization, inequality, corruption, and regime change." **[In light
of the dangers that the present Russian regime represents, however, what
matters is deterrence, which always has a strong psychological element.
Restraining the behavior of the Putin regime requires creating the
impression in both word and deed that violations will meet with a
serious response]{.underline}**. **[If Trump]{.underline}** becomes
president, he will, of course, have access to intelligence information
that may change some of his impressions. But if he
**[persists]{.underline}** in his shallow opinions, **[the consequences
could be felt by everyone]{.underline}**.

#### U.S.-Russian war causes extinction.

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, **[even in an all-out
nuclear war between the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and Russia]{.underline}**, despite horrific casualties, **[neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed by the direct
effects of the blast]{.underline}**, fire, and radiation.8 **[The
aftermath could be much worse]{.underline}**: the
**[burning]{.underline}** of **[flammable materials could send massive
amounts of smoke into the atmosphere]{.underline}**, which would absorb
sunlight and cause sustained global cooling, severe ozone loss, and
agricultural disruption -- **[a nuclear winter]{.underline}**.

According to one model 9 , **[an all-out exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}**10 **[could lead to a drop in global temperatures
of around 8°C, making it impossible to grow food for]{.underline}** 4 to
**[5 years. This could leave some survivors]{.underline}** in parts of
Australia and New Zealand, **[but they would be in a very precarious
situation and the threat of extinction from other sources would be
great. An exchange on this scale is only possible between the US and
Russia who have more than 90% of the world's nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads each,
although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that
even **[a small regional nuclear war involving 100 nuclear weapons
would]{.underline}** produce a nuclear winter serious enough to **[put
two billion]{.underline}** people **[at risk]{.underline}** of
starvation,12 **[though this]{.underline}** estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 **[Wars on this scale are unlikely to lead
to]{.underline}** outright **[human extinction]{.underline}**, but this
does suggest that conflicts which are around an order of magnitude
larger may be likely to threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised
that there is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large
nuclear war on global climate. This remains an area where increased
academic research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a
better understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt,
would have high returns.

**[It is]{.underline}** very **[difficult to precisely estimate the
probability of existential risk from nuclear war]{.underline}** over the
next century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence
intervals. According to many experts, **[the most likely nuclear
war]{.underline}** at present **[is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}**.14 **[However, given the relatively modest size
of their arsenals, the risk of human extinction is plausibly greater
from a conflict between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia]{.underline}**. Tensions between
these countries have increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable
to rule out the possibility of them rising further in the future.

The latest report on global arms transfers from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) shows that, **[during the
latest five-year study period (2014--2018), arms transfers rose 8 % from
the previous period]{.underline}** (2009--2013). Three-quarters of
global arms transfers involved the United States (36 %), Russia (21 %),
France (7 %), Germany (6 %) and China (5 %). **[The volume of China's
arms transfers in 2014--2018 rose by less than 3 % from the 2009--2013
period. The figures suggest growth in China's arms exports has slowed
radically from the boom years at the start of this decade. The number of
customer countries, however, increased]{.underline}** from the previous
five-year period from 41 to 53 countries, even if arms supplies
continued to focus on Pakistan (37 % share), Bangladesh (16 %) and
Algeria (11 %). **[China's arms export possibilities are limited by
political reluctance in many countries to purchase Chinese
arms]{.underline}**. SIPRI notes that, among the world's top 10 arms
importers, India, Australia, South Korea and Vietnam do not buy any arms
from China. Asia and Oceania account for 70 % of Chinese arms exports,
Africa 20 % and the Middle East 6 %.

2008 to \$1.13 billion in 2017]{.underline}**.1 **[The lion's share of

### Russia

#### Russia influence and arms sales massively declining, need new markets to shore up dominance

5/5/**2019** \["Russia Makes Some of the Deadliest Weapons on Earth (But
There Is a Problem)" online @
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-makes-some-deadliest-weapons-earth-there-problem-55812>,
loghry\]

Russia\'s defense industry is face to face with a major foe, but it\'s
not a foreign military power. **[The Kremlin has been striving to
modernize all branches of the Russian military, but the country\'s
defense industry is struggling thanks to decreasing volumes of
orders]{.underline}**, difficulties in attracting high-skilled talent
and limits to its technological capabilities. According to recent
figures, the performance of Russia\'s aerospace sector is declining
precipitously. In 2018, for instance, Russian aircraft and spacecraft
makers produced 13.5 percent less than in 2017. And there\'s been no
letup in 2019 either: In the first two months of the year, aerospace
output plummeted 48 percent year on year.

**[The decline in Russia\'s defense output raises concerns about the
competitive strength of Russia\'s defense industry in general, whose
health is critical if the country is to project itself as a military
power in the longer term]{.underline}**. Russian Deputy Prime Minister
**[Yuri Borisov attributed the reduction in output to a slowdown of
orders for military systems, but projections suggest the slowdown is not
just a short-term fluctuation; in fact, it\'s expected to become even
worse in the future.]{.underline}** The downturn in oil prices has taken
a bite out of Russia\'s bottom line, squeezing spending for the military
--- all at a time when the country\'s arms manufacturers have lost their
competitive edge in the global arms market. Together, these factors
ensure that Russia\'s defense industry will struggle to get out of its
funk.

Suffering From a Dearth of Funds

This dire picture stands in stark contrast to Russia\'s frequent
presentation of sensational new platforms. **[In reality,]{.underline}**
however, **[just a few of the big-ticket weapon systems --- such as the
T-14 main battle tank or the Su-57 fighter aircraft --- find buyers, as
the rest remain mere prototypes]{.underline}**. **[Russia has
prioritized some hardware]{.underline}**, **[such as the Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline}**, due to their
strategic relevance to the country\'s overall military posture, but
**[Moscow has failed to fully develop other programs or only introduced
them on a limited scale.]{.underline}**

Under pressure from a limited government budget, **[the Kremlin even
started reducing its military spending in 2017]{.underline}** --- **[a
strong indicator that]{.underline}**, **[despite the modernization push,
Russia\'s financial challenges are taking a toll]{.underline}** on the
country ambitions. Economically, the plunge in oil prices at the end of
2014 hurt Russia\'s bottom line, depriving the country of essential
revenue and forcing it to dip into its reserves to bridge the gap.
**[Today,]{.underline}** more than four years on, **[Russian oil
revenues are rising, yet the country is continuing to deal with the
consequences of the lean years. Beyond that, low revenues from
taxes]{.underline}**, which have forced Russia to raise taxes and the
retirement age, **[and Western sanctions]{.underline}** over Moscow\'s
activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, **[have shrunk the financial pool
available to military planners]{.underline}**.

But the Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there. **[In the past, Russia has
benefited from its position as a major global arms exporter to fuel
further military development]{.underline}**. During the 1990s, for
example, such sales were critical to the country as it faced severe
economic hardship. **[While Russia remains the world\'s second-largest
arms exporter]{.underline}** (only the United States sells more), **[the
actual value of those exports has been decreasing
significantly]{.underline}**. **[Between 2014 and 2018, their total
value dropped by as much as 17 percent. Again, budgetary limits
are]{.underline}** somewhat **[to blame:]{.underline}** **[In the past,
Russia frequently used arms exports as a political tool, offering
weapons at a heavy discount]{.underline}**, if not entirely free. But
**[with Russia no longer able to offer customers a good deal on its
fighter jets and other defense products, the country is losing
business.]{.underline}**

**[And Russia\'s arms industry faces an even greater problem in the
years to come: reduced competitiveness. Russia has long dominated some
of the market by offering affordable military equipment without
attaching any conditions]{.underline}** regarding human rights, **[but
the rise of China\'s military industry]{.underline}**, as well as
**[several smaller producers around the world, has made it much more
difficult to compete for contracts.]{.underline}**

Ultimately, **[the loss of export opportunities not only complicates
Russia\'s efforts to finance its defense industry, it also reduces the
scale at which the defense industry produces, which, in turn, decreases
scale-dependent savings that accompany higher levels of production. In
effect, this means that the more Russia fails to find foreign customers
for specific weapon systems, the more it will become burdened with a
higher relative cost per unit as it seeks to meet its own needs. The
conundrum, in turn, will further limit Russia\'s ability to
competitively price weapons systems for export, thereby perpetuating the
effect.]{.underline}**

**[U.S. arms exports rely on a simple bargain: Clients join an
American-dominated global supply chain in return for better value
weapons, larger orders of subcomponents from local firms, and access to
leading-edge weapons technology]{.underline}**. **[These smaller states,
in turn, surrender to the United States large swathes of their foreign
and defense policies, including]{.underline}** **[foregoing sales to
regimes that threaten U.S. interests]{.underline}**. The process is
characterized by hard bargaining and by a considerable degree of
coercion by the United States, such as when it temporarily kicked Israel
out of the Joint Strike Fighter program for selling unmanned aerial
vehicle parts to China. Sovereign states are of course reluctant to hand
over their foreign policy, but **[the United States can use financial
incentives]{.underline}** (thereby reducing the economic benefit at

the formidable missile defense complex the United States is trying to
create in South Asia among itself, Japan, and South Korea. Trump has
suggested that, contrary to current agreements, South Korea pay for the
THAAD missile defense system, at a billion dollars a battery, deployed
in North Gyeongsang province: "We're going to protect them. But they
should pay for that, and they understand that." But South Korea has
already paid a heavy price for deploying THAAD due to Chinese economic
retaliation. And there are massive security spillovers if South Korea
continues to participate. Japan and South Korea's participation in the
Aegis system, for example, pulls two states loath to cooperate with each
other bilaterally into something resembling a collective-security
network. If economic concessions on THAAD or a possible \$1.7 billion
Aegis missile purchase are necessary to bring South Korea into this

#### \*\*Continued liberalized arms sales crucial to shoring up allies investments in the arms market and choking Russia and China out. The plan sets an international precedent and provides opportunities for hostile states to gain market strength and undermine U.S. interests.

A smart **[arms transfer policy would strangle both
Russia]{.underline}**, the number two exporter, **[and
China]{.underline}**, which is trying to take its place.
**[Russia]{.underline}** in particular **[needs arms exports to fund its
aggressive but underfunded military modernization plans]{.underline}**
(not to mention hard currency for its weak economy). **[It is in
America's interests to choke off as large a percentage of the Russian
export market as possible]{.underline}** in favor of the products of
more closely aligned countries. In terms of both American influence and
curbing proliferation, **[it is better for countries like Malaysia and
Indonesia to buy German or South Korean submarines than Russian. This
will have the added benefit of diminishing the quality and, eventually,
raising the price of the products Russia will export to states, such as
Syria, that cannot buy arms from anywhere else]{.underline}**. In the
spirit of bolstering potential partners and limiting the reach of
Russian weapons, **[the United States can directly compete against
Russia in one important market. India]{.underline}** accounts for a
stunning 39 percent of Russia's recent arms exports (SIPRI). Indian
orders might be big enough to provide some meaningful economic benefits
to the United States, but more importantly, **[U.S. sales would cut into
Russia's market share]{.underline}**. Tying India and the United States
closer, even if it means allowing most production, jobs, and even some
technology transfer to go abroad, should be a central goal of U.S. arms
transfer policy. Lockheed Martin's offer to transfer the F-16 production
line to India appears a step in this direction. **[America should accept
that Saudi Arabia is going to buy a lot of U.S. weapons, but avoid
coddling the Kingdom.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia (and its Gulf State
allies) will remain an important customer largely because the country is
desperate to keep the United States involved in the region. **[The Saudi
military is almost entirely American equipped and trained and most of
its military capability requires continued American support to function
for more than a couple of days]{.underline}**. A few additional jobs may
result from selling more arms to the Kingdom, but this may not justify
giving up the leverage over Saudi and its allies' policies towards
Yemen, Syria, and Qatar that do not necessarily advance American
interests. The United States should encourage, but steer, Europe. Since
the Cold War the United States has used its economic and political clout
to systematically inhibit an independent European defense production
capability. This has certainly increased U.S. market share, but
continued efforts come at the expense of more important political goals.
It would be much easier to ask NATO allies to spend 2 percent of their
GDP on defense if more of this money would go into indigenous
industries. The United States should recognize that European global
competitiveness in the arms trade can serve American interests (and
perhaps provide competition for its own sheltered defense industry).
This will relieve pressure on Europe to export to countries embargoed by
the United States, which undermines the influence of U.S. arms transfer
policy. When the United States placed real restrictions on arms
transfers to Egypt's al-Sisi regime, other states quickly attempted to
fill this gap. As one French policymaker cynically noted, "Obama was the
\[French fighter jet\] Rafale's best salesperson." Overall, from
2012-2015 the export agreements of major European sellers to Egypt have
gone up forty-seven-fold over the previous four-year period. That said,
**[Europe has by and large cooperated with successful arms embargoes
against Russia and China]{.underline}** (although Europe does sell
nearly \$400 million of dual use equipment to China each year).
**[Maintaining and even tightening these key sanctions must be the
highest priority of any defense cooperation policy with Europe. More
broadly, fixation on "buying American" misses tremendous opportunities
for leading coordinated action with like-minded states in Europe and
elsewhere]{.underline}**. This is feasible given that the United States,
NATO members, South Korea, Israel, and a few other allies account for a
whopping 62 percent of total global arms exports (SIPRI). To this end,
**[the United States should liberalize its own market]{.underline}**.
Much as when "foreign" automotive firms build their cars in the United
States, acquiring products from abroad may create more jobs than selling
weapons internationally. **[The U.S. Air Force's current \$16 billion
fighter-trainer contract has been largely narrowed down to three
candidates with foreign connections]{.underline}**: a Lockheed
Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries version of Korea's T-50; a new design
from a Boeing-Saab team; and an entirely foreign offering from Leonardo.
**[Winning such a contract will give one of three like-minded
states]{.underline}** (South Korea, Sweden, or Italy, respectively) **[a
boost in other international competitions against less scrupulous
dealers. And the United States can still shape these exports for its
political interests]{.underline}**, such as when it recently vetoed the
T-50's export to Uzbekistan. America is Like No Other Arms Exporter and
Should Act Like It **[The United States]{.underline}** --- by dint of
its huge military budget, massive defense R&D, and long dominance of the
global arms market --- **[can use arms transfers in ways beyond the
dreams of its competitors]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[many competitors
recognize this]{.underline}**, albeit grudgingly. I have interviewed
**[officials in multiple countries]{.underline}** (both clients and
competitors of the United States) **[claim]{.underline}**ing **[they
will defer to U.S. wishes on arms exports]{.underline}** if they trust
it is done for political rather than economic reasons. **[Many of
America's closest allies]{.underline}**, who are also arms export
competitors, **[look to the United States for leadership on
controversial importers such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. And, the
Trump administration should be given due credit for exercising
discretion, given, for instance, its recent unilateral embargo on arms
transfer to South Sudan. In fact, one administration official stated
flatly that sales "will not come at the expense of human rights." In no
small part, U.S. domination of the global arms trade is based on the
world's belief that the United States uses its clout to advance its
political ends, not economic gain. Destroying this reputation will do
little to bring jobs to the United States, while doing much to damage
American influence abroad.

online @

loghry\]

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. The United
States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second place
Russia remains a distant 23 percent), and has more than 40 defense
companies in the top 100 globally. However, with civilian deaths caused
by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at between 16,000 and 50,000 by
the end of 2018, **[calls for the United States to suspend arms sales to
its largest client --- Saudi Arabia --- have understandably gained
traction in both Congress and the public]{.underline}**. More generally,
several authors have penned articles in these virtual pages calling for
more selective U.S. arms export decisions or outright embargos, governed
less by economic motivations and more by concern about blowback, human
rights, dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. I respectfully
disagree with all of these recommendations. **[Whether it is delayed
approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase, an outright embargo,
like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, or denial of technology transfer, as in the
2016 Turkish Patriot missile request[, using the withholding of arms
sales as a blunt force instrument of coercion is unlikely to produce
desired strategic benefits and often backfires]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[Arms exports are best used for maintaining or strengthening
relationships while]{.underline}** **[limiting adversary access to
client states]{.underline}**; **[a tool of nuanced
influence]{.underline}**, not outright coercion. In fact, **[threatening
to withhold arms sales to coerce a state into changing its behavior
often has the opposite effect, leading clients to diversify their arms
sourcing instead of shifting course]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Similarly,
calls to restrict technology transfer and worries about demands for
direct offsets mistake what is known as "design technology transfer" for
the much more difficult "capacity" level of transfer. Both are explained
in more detail below, but for now it is worth noting that design
transfer, the level at which most of these offsets occur, does not lead
to the creation of an independent defense industry, but instead provides
the United States with a source of political power. The United States
should not fear technology transfer, but with the appropriate end-user
controls, encourage it. Additionally, while a large domestic market
provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for
political influence, sometimes economics do matter; especially when it
comes to preserving complex production lines for future flexibility.
Finally, **[the United States should not look to use an arms embargo to
coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but simply because
it is unlikely to work]{.underline}**. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting
Arms **[[Arms sales are useful tools for]{.underline}]{.mark}**
maintaining communication, strengthening relationships, and **[[keeping
potential adversary states at bay]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Conversely, as
a blunt instrument of coercion (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend
Y), they are likely losers. Senior U.S. government officials involved in
the arms transfer process that I interviewed over the past year during
the course of my research have echoed similar sentiments. **[This is
also borne out by previous research providing evidence that using arms
transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful]{.underline}**. Interestingly, **[coercion attempts using
arms transfers are least likely to be successful when used as a
punishment or threat against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**. Instead, **[punishments in the form of an embargo
can often push a client to]{.underline}** **[diversify sourcing rather
than to change behavior]{.underline}**.

### China -- Generic

#### Decreasing arms sales opens a vacuum that China will fill in. Has the capability and will use increased exports to further challenge the U.S.

Transformations Program at the S Rajaratnam School of International
Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore) 4/16/**2019**

Admittedly, **[China remains a smallish arms exporter, compared to the
United States]{.underline}**, which dominates the global arms bazaar,
typically capturing 35% to 40% of the market. Moreover, **[Beijing
is]{.underline}** still **[overwhelmingly dependent on sales to just a
few countries]{.underline}**, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh. **[It
also]{.underline}** still **[relies on countries]{.underline}** either
**[too poor to buy Western armaments or who have been subjected
to]{.underline}** **[arms embargoes]{.underline}**. Few big-spending
arms importers -- such as the oil-rich Gulf states -- have ever been
interested in Chinese arms (other than armed drones). Iran used to be a
major consumer of Chinese arms, but it has not placed a new order with
Beijing in several years. **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, **[China's
growing, cumulative political, economic, and military rise is reshaping
global as well as regional geopolitics, including strategic alliances
and balances of power -- and arms exports are a critical ingredient in
this remaking]{.underline}**. While Chinese arms exports may have had
their beginnings in mostly economic rationales -- such as profits and
support for the domestic arms industry -- increasingly **[overseas arms
sales are being used as a tool to]{.underline}** **[advance Beijing's
strategic interests]{.underline}**. **[This is self-evident
in]{.underline}** the growing range of Chinese arms sales -- especially
to Africa and Latin America -- and in **[Beijing's readiness to sell its
most advanced weapons systems with no political strings attached and
generally at prices below those of Western competitors]{.underline}**.
As such, **[arms exports will]{.underline}** also **[increasingly
figure]{.underline}** **[in the growing strategic competition with the
United States]{.underline}**. The arms competition between these two
countries -- both in East Asia and increasingly globally as well -- is
synonymous with their emerging great-power rivalry. In this regard,
**[China has a growing capability to shape the direction and character
of this arms competition -- not only through its military-technological
development and diffusion of arms exports, but]{.underline}** more
importantly, **[through its strategic choices that influence the
contours of alliances and military advantage in different geographic
areas]{.underline}**.

**[Chinese arms sales appear to be more transactional than an instrument
of foreign policy]{.underline}**. For instance, there has been no uptick
in Chinese arms deliveries to core Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
partner countries since this initiative was announced in 2013. Indeed,
out of the 74 countries that are directly linked to BRI projects, only
23 of them --- 31 per cent --- have received Chinese major weapon
systems since 2013. **[Further evidence of China's transactional arms
exports is the arms diplomacy that China and Taiwan have tried to apply
to woo allies on the world stage]{.underline}**. While economic
incentives have been widely used to influence changes in diplomatic
recognition from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China, China has
not, in the past five years, transferred any major conventional weapons
systems to countries that recognise or used to recognise Taiwan. Both of
**[these examples reflect the fact that arms sales are not a
straightforward foreign policy tool to manoeuvre]{.underline}**. Arms
sales take place if and only if recipient states have the need for new
weapons systems and have a preference for Chinese products. **[China
still traditionally sells to states where Western exporters will not
sell due to sanctions]{.underline}** (like Iran), **[states that cannot
afford to purchase Western weapons systems]{.underline}** (like Zambia)
**[and states that fall into both categories]{.underline}** (like Sudan
and Venezuela). **[The only niche market where China has been able to
make inroads into traditional Western export markets such as Gulf
countries has been that of UAVs. This again was possible because Western
exporters, in this case the United States]{.underline}**, **[refused to
sell]{.underline}** **[their own systems]{.underline}**.

argues that the Arab World may have found a willing partner for years to

nature of arms deals. **[China is the world's third largest exporter of
arms, behind the United States and Russia]{.underline}**, representing
around 6.2% of global trade for conventional major arms. **[In the
Middle East, China currently ranks fifteenth]{.underline}** on the arms
suppliers list, while the U.S. remains the largest provider. **[As China

Europe. Unlike the US and Russia, Chinese arms deals have traditionally
focused on commercial, rather than political purposes. Despite this, the
growing influence of China on the world stage begs the question as to
what strategic role Chinese arms sales will play in one of the world's
most volatile regions.

Although **[the total volume of major arms flow from China to Africa is

Russia]{.underline}**. Between 2013--17, Russia sold major arms to 14
Africa countries, compared to the 23 of China. This "blanket" style of
selling does not typically fit with the notion of linking targeted arms
sales with foreign policy objectives. **[The diversity in the types of
weapons and of arms recipients]{.underline}** (e.g., from Algeria to
South Africa and Kenya to Cote d\'Ivoire) **[suggests a
more]{.underline}** **[demand and supply relationship]{.underline}**.
**[As China continues to develop its arms industry, any international
buyer will help expand its network, offer important developmental
feedback, and improve weapon quality and company
profitability]{.underline}**. **[The fall in export of Russian made
weapons to Africa corresponded with the rise in Chinese exports,
potentially due to the availability of more cost-effective
options]{.underline}**. This is especially the case in Algeria, where
import of major Chinese arms increased by 46-fold between 2008-2012 and

**[Some of the world's largest arms buyers are in Asia]{.underline}**.
According to SIPRI, during the period 2013 to 2017, five of the ten
biggest arms importers were in the region: India, China, Indonesia,
Australia and Pakistan. Vietnam, South Korea, and Taiwan were among the
top 15 largest arms importers. India alone accounted for 12 per cent of
all arms transfers during this period, maintaining its position as the
world's largest arms buyer for the past several years (just ahead of
Saudi Arabia). Its arms imports increased by 24 per cent between the
periods 2008 to 2012 and 2013 to 2017. **[All these arms purchases have
been enabled by a continuing upward trend in military spending in the
region]{.underline}**. According to SIPRI, defence expenditures in Asia
and Oceania in 2017 was up 3.6 per cent over 2016 and 59 per cent higher
than a decade earlier. So there is plenty of money available for new
weaponry. Two of the biggest beneficiaries of this rise in Asian arms
imports are the United States and China. According to SIPRI data, the US
captured 34 per cent of the global arms market for the period from 2013
to 2017, easily beating Russia, the world's second largest arms exporter
(which took only a 22 per cent share). **[US arms transfers in 2017 were

**[Russia remains a major player in the global defense
market]{.underline}**. Various estimates are available on the size of
Russian arms exports (more on that later)---but all **[leading market
monitors agree that Russia is currently the world's second-largest arms
supplier]{.underline}** after the United States. **[Arms exports
are]{.underline}** an **[important]{.underline}** source of earnings
**[for the Russian economy]{.underline}**. In 2016, Russia exported
\$285.7 billion1 worth of goods and services; according to the Federal
Service for Military and Technical Cooperation (FSMTC), defense hardware
and services accounted for 5.2 percent of that figure (\$15 billion in
absolute terms).2 But **[Russia's overall exports rely
disproportionately on raw materials and
minerals]{.underline}**---especially hydrocarbons, which account for 62
percent of the total.3 **[If we exclude energy from the tally, arms
exports become even more important]{.underline}** for the Russian
economy. For example, **[they make up over 60 percent of Russian
machinery exports]{.underline}** (\$15 billion of \$24.4 billion).4 In
other words, **[arms exports are one of the very few success stories in
the Russian high-tech sector]{.underline}**, along with the exports of
nuclear technologies and materials. **[Arms exports are
important]{.underline}** to Russia not just economically, but **[also
politically and militarily]{.underline}**. President Vladimir Putin once
famously said at a sitting of the Commission for Military and Technical
Cooperation5 : "Effective military and technical cooperation is a potent
instrument of promoting our national interests, political as well as
economic."6 **[The Kremlin may also see major arms contracts as part and
parcel of its long-standing and developing]{.underline}** political and
economic **[relationships]{.underline}**, for instance **[with China,
India, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and many other
countries]{.underline}**. **[Another notable development in this regard
is the growing noncommercial arms deliveries to Russia's allies in the
Collective Security Treaty Organization]{.underline}** (CSTO),
especially Belarus and Armenia, and to non-CSTO member Syria. These
deliveries are a major instrument of Russian foreign policy. **[They
help to strengthen Russia's closest allies that serve as buffer states
along its borders]{.underline}** (Belarus, Armenia), and to suppress the
terror threat--- mostly in Syria, but also in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
Furthermore, **[arms exports are an important indirect factor
contributing to domestic stability]{.underline}**. This is because,
according to the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, **[the defense
industry employs more than 1.3 million people]{.underline}**.7 **[Since
exports account for about a third of Russia's defense
output]{.underline}** (more on that in the "Other factors of stagnation"
section), **[the livelihood of roughly 400,000 Russian engineers,
scientists, and technicians, as well as members of their families,
directly depends on defense exports]{.underline}**. As a rule, **[these
people form a conservative and patriotically minded electorate that is
staunchly loyal to the Putin administration. As an election strategy,
the Russian president and his United Russia party indirectly support
this electorate through arms export stimulus packages]{.underline}**
(credit financing, government-issued guarantees, etc.). **[Russian arms
exports]{.underline}** and defense relations with other countries also
**[serve as important propaganda instruments]{.underline}**. Russia's
state-owned and pro-government media outlets offer regular and generous
coverage of the latest achievements of Russian defense suppliers in
foreign markets. Such achievements include large contracts signed with
foreign customers and participation of Russian companies in
international arms expos. **[The rapid growth of Russian defense exports
in the 2000s is highlighted as a major achievement of the Putin
era]{.underline}**.8 The media often emphasize the personal role played
in that success story by President Putin himself and by Sergey Chemezov,
head of Rostec (the parent company of the Russian arms export
intermediary Rosoboronexport), who has been a close friend of Putin
since the latter's days as a Soviet agent in East Germany.9 Until
recently, the upbeat picture painted by Russian propaganda was backed by
figures. For example, during the Putin presidency, Russian arms exports
skyrocketed by 440 percent, from \$3.4 billion in 1999 (when Vladimir
Putin became acting prime minister) to a peak of \$15.7 billion in
2013.10 In recent years, however, that growth has slowed and then
stalled completely. The focus of this paper is on the current dynamics
of Russian arms exports, the reasons for their steady growth in the
2000s and early 2010s, their current stagnation, and the outlook for the
coming years.

Asia]{.underline}**. From 2000 to 2016, almost a fifth of Russia's arms
exports went to the MENA region.2 To put this in perspective, **[in
2009, Moscow sold approximately \$9 billion worth of arms to this
region. In 2016, it sold \$21.4 billion.3 Many of these sales are
upgrades to existing packages]{.underline}**.4 Since 2000, **[Moscow
also diversified from traditional Soviet-era regional
clients]{.underline}**. Since officially coming to power in May 2000, if
not before, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to restore Russia's
image as a Great Power in the context of zero-sum anti-Westernism--- for
Russia to win, the West had to lose. His approach to the Middle East is
the extension of former Russian prime minister Evgeniy Primakov's vision
of a "multipolar world," driven by desire to prevent the West from
dominating any region, and curb Western support for democratization
efforts in other countries. **[For the last 17 years, Putin worked to

Russia's defense industry is a major source of
employment.]{.underline}** Russian President Vladimir Putin renewed his
emphasis on modernizing the armed forces, especially the navy, on May 7,
2012, on the same day as he took office as president for a third time.6
**[Internationally, the Russian defense industry is a source of
important revenue]{.underline}**. Thus, Putin lamented in February 2012
about Iraq and countries undergoing the Arab Spring, "Russian companies
are losing their decades-long positions in local commercial markets and
are being deprived of large commercial contracts."7 As Sergei Chemezov,
chief of the powerful state industrial holding Rostec, said in February
2015, "As for the conflict situation in the Middle East, I do not
conceal it, and everyone understands this, the more conflicts there are,
the more they \[clients\] buy weapons from us. Volumes are continuing to
grow despite sanctions. Mainly, it is in Latin America and the Middle
East."8 Yet, **[arms sales entail far more to the Kremlin than mere
financial gains. They are also Moscow's tactical foreign policy tool for
wielding political influence and changing power balance
dynamic]{.underline}**s. Indeed, in July 2012, Putin said that arms
exports are "an effective instrument for advancing \[Moscow's\] national
interests, both political and economic."9 **[In December 2013, Deputy
Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said that Russia's arms sales are the most
important element of Moscow's relations with other
countries.]{.underline}**10 **[And Moscow's chief goal---regime
survival, which it hopes to achieve through reduction of Western
influence---runs counter to Western interests]{.underline}** and values.
**[Thus, in the MENA region, Moscow courts virtually everyone, and
competes with the West whenever an opportunity arises. Arms exports are
a major component of these efforts.]{.underline}**

**[Since Moscow's demonstration]{.underline}** of strength (with Iran's

### Russia -- India 

#### Continued sales to India crucial to lock out Russia over the long term, ending sales now risks Russian dominance

**[As for Russia, SIPRI calculates that its share of the global market
has slipped]{.underline}** (to about 22% in 2013-17). But it offers a
blend of tried-and-tested hardware and, to a few customers, superb
know-how, especially in air defence. **[That creates a dilemma for
America, which hopes soon to sell weapons worth \$6bn to India, but is
dismayed by that country's determination to acquire S-400 air-defence
systems from Russia]{.underline}**: missiles that could ward off
potential threats from China or Pakistan. Other countries intent on
continuing to buy Russian include Indonesia and Vietnam. Jim Mattis,
America's defence secretary, has implored Congress not to be too harsh
with Russia's customers, so long as they pledge gradually to reduce
their reliance. In a letter leaked in July to Breaking Defense, a
specialist news service, he told a congressman: "**[We are faced with a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to decrease Russia's dominance in key
regions." But that could only happen if America were free to sell its
own weapons]{.underline}**. For customers, that means that for the
foreseeable future they can keep both American and Russian weapons in
their arsenals. It is telling that **[India has recently been admitted
to the Missile Technology Control Regime, a group of countries which
promises not to help pariah states obtain ballistic missiles. That will
make it easier for both America and Russia to sell long-range rockets to
India]{.underline}**. The two arms-sales giants, who do not agree on
much else, have welcomed India into the club.

### China -- A2: No Capacity 

#### China poised and capable of massive arms exports

**[Beijing continues to build its stature as a global arms
exporter]{.underline}**, according to the Pentagon's annual report to
Congress on the military and security developments of the People's
Republic of China (PRC). Per Department of Defense research, **[China
completed over \$25 billion worth of arms sales between 2013 and 2017,
thereby rising to the level of world's fourth-largest arms
supplier]{.underline}**. This largely mirrors an earlier report released
by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in March
which noted that **[China ranked among the world's top-five largest
exporters of defense-related hardware, behind the U.S., Russia, France
and Germany]{.underline}**, with 5.7 percent of the global total from
2013 to 2017. **[The rise of China's defense budget, aided by decades of
strong economic growth, has fed the development of military industrial
capabilities. This]{.underline}**, in turn, **[has elevated the profile
of China as a regional and global arms supplier]{.underline}**. **[For
most of its history, the PRC has been a net importer of military
materiel]{.underline}**, relying on the former Soviet Union to help it
develop its own military-industrial complex in its early years. **[As
its defense industrial sector has matured, China has placed a premium on
domestic innovation and production. Over time this has allowed the
country to reduce its dependency on arms imports]{.underline}**, the
array of which remain limited due to bans enacted following the
communist regime crackdown on Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protesters
in 1989.

#### \*\*China poised to fill in any gaps in the arms market -- weapons more likely to enter third party conflicts

**CSIS** (Center for Strategic & International Studies -- China Power
Project) 4/26/**2018** \["How dominant is China in the global arms
trade?" online @ <https://chinapower.csis.org/china-global-arms-trade/>,
loghry\]

That said, **[Chinese weaponry is becoming increasingly attractive due
in part to its cost-effectiveness]{.underline}**. Although Chinese arms
are often less advanced than those sold by other countries, the DOD
notes that **["Chinese arms are less expensive than those offered by the
top international arms suppliers... \[but still\] have advanced
capabilities."]{.underline}** For example, the low-cost K-8 jet trainer
is estimated to make up 80 percent of all jet trainer aircraft in
Africa. **[China is actively working to]{.underline}** **[strengthen its
foothold]{.underline}** **[in certain markets]{.underline}**, such as
Algeria. China's exports to the North African country totaled \$483
million between 2008 and 2014, but jumped to \$247 million in 2015 alone
and peaked at \$499 million in 2016 as several weapon orders were
fulfilled. These procurements included three C-28A frigates, which were
ordered by Algeria in 2012. Although not a member of the Missile
Technology Control Regime, a non-proliferation agreement targeted at
missiles and systems capable of delivery weapons of mass destruction,
Beijing is generally compliant with international protocols. The 2002
Regulations on the Export Control of Missiles and Missile-related Items
and Technologies, for instance, outlines measures to safeguard against
proliferation. In June 2017, China published a draft of the Export
Control Law, which if enacted will update existing legislation and
establish a comprehensive export control regime. **[Beijing has been
quick to adapt its domestic regulations to account for emerging
technology. This has enabled it to]{.underline}** **[fill the void left
by other suppliers]{.underline}**. **[The US, which has long been at the
forefront of]{.underline}** unmanned aerial vehicle (**[UAV)
development, has purposely restricted the export of its UAVs.
Regulations that until recently characterized long-range unmanned aerial
systems as cruise missiles, have also limited overseas access of
American UAVs. These factors have created a]{.underline}** **[ripe
market opportunity for China]{.underline}**, **[which has made its UAVs
available to countries]{.underline}** such as Nigeria and Egypt. It is
worth noting that **[Chinese weapons have found their way into various
conflict zones]{.underline}**. Reports indicate that **[Chinese arms
have been used during conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan, and Somalia]{.underline}**. In July 2014, **[China

9,000 automatic rifles, and 24 million rounds of ammunition to the South
Sudanese government, whose actions have been widely criticized by the
international community]{.underline}**.

### China -- A2: Exports Inevitable 

#### Chinese exports not inevitable

**Forecast International** (Defence Web, defence news portal)
5/13/**2019** \["China's arms exports on the rise" online @
<https://www.defenceweb.co.za/daily-news/international-news/chinas-arms-exports-on-the-rise/>,
loghry\]

**[That China should reach this level of global success may seem
inevitable from a 21st century lens, but during the embryonic stage of
its military-industrial development in the 1950s, such a leap would not
have appeared foreordained]{.underline}**. At that time, Chinese weapons
exports were largely driven by ideological concerns. China delivered
low-tech, largely obsolete weaponry to strategically aligned communist
regimes and communist-inspired "national liberation" movements in the
developing world. Because China's defense-industrial base was still
primitive and reliant upon Soviet technological assistance and weapons
deliveries, communist China mainly acted as an intermediary for the
Soviets in theaters of war such as Vietnam. By the late 1960s, China had
forged a close strategic alliance with Pakistan, with massive Chinese
arms sales and deliveries to Islamabad providing a crucial cornerstone
for burgeoning Sino-Pakistani ties. Through these weapons exports, China
was able to cultivate a crucial regional relationship that continues to
this day (and Pakistan remains China's largest weapons export market).
The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) provided Beijing with yet another opening
into new markets. With both sides requiring fresh influxes of weapons
and ammunition, China's no-strings-attached export policy suited both
combatants as they increasingly found themselves marginalized on the
international market. The war marked the rise of China as a large
weapons supplier on the global market and secured Iran as a lucrative,
long-term export market for Chinese defense products. Today **[China's
primary export market remains Asia]{.underline}** (including Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Myanmar, among others), **[but it has successfully and
steadily penetrated parts of the developing world, including Africa,
Latin America, and the Middle East]{.underline}**.

### Russia -- A2: Training Barrier 

#### \*\*Russia tech in Middle East won't cause training barrier

**Borshchevskaya '17** \[Anna Borshchevskaya is a Senior Fellow at The
Washington Institute, focusing on Russia\'s policy toward the Middle
East and is also a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University; In

Middle East," 12/13/17,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/opeds/Borshchevskaya20171222-Jamestown.pdf>\]

Another practical consideration is that **[many local military personnel
in the MENA region have trained on Russian weaponry and feel comfortable
operating it. As one American source familiar with the situation
explained it, "If you have an AK-47, why change to an
M-16?"]{.underline}**16 **[For example, helicopters are especially
crucial to Egypt's anti-Islamist campaign; and according to first-hand
pilot accounts, Russia' less expensive helicopters fit Egypt's needs
well]{.underline}**. Overall, Russian attack helicopters are not
necessarily superior technologically, but they bring heavy firepower to
a fight. They may fare worse in a contested air space, but the Sinai
airspace is not contested**[. The Russian MiG-29 is a highly advanced
aircraft, easier to maintain than an American one, and cheaper than an
F-2217 (which the US is currently not even exporting).]{.underline}**

### Russia -- A2: No Demand 

#### There will be demand for robust, innovative, and cost-effective Russian tech

**Borshchevskaya '17** \[Anna Borshchevskaya is a Senior Fellow at The
Washington Institute, focusing on Russia\'s policy toward the Middle
East and is also a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University; In
addition, she is a fellow at the European Foundation for Democracy and

Middle East," 12/13/17,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/opeds/Borshchevskaya20171222-Jamestown.pdf>\]

When countries prefer Russian weaponry over American systems, it is
usually for evident reasons. **[The US will not sell weapons to many of
Russia's clients]{.underline}** for a variety of reasons. **[Russian
weaponry is relatively inexpensive and]{.underline}**, generally
speaking, **[often more robust than comparable American
systems]{.underline}**. **[In some areas, Moscow's]{.underline}**
systems lag severely behind the US in terms of quality and capabilities,
but in others, it is **[a near-peer competitor]{.underline}**. For
instance, **[Moscow is quite good at building anti-aircraft
missiles,]{.underline}** such as the S-300 and S-400 systems, based on
lessonslearned from the Kosovo Air War. The American F-35 joint strike
fighter can likely currently beat an S-400 (although there is no way to
know for sure unless they engage in direct combat). However, **[Moscow
is developing the next generation, the S-500]{.underline}**, whose full
capabilities are unknown. **[Russian current-generation aircraft and
ballistic missile defenses are on par with those of the US in terms of
defense technology. Some Russian missiles have as long a range as
American missiles]{.underline}**, a few of them even longer. 14 In
addition, **[the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system is very slow,
bureaucratic and cumbersome, while Moscow takes less time to deliver
after a contract is signed.]{.underline}** Moscow is weak when it comes
to follow-up support of sales, and **[Russian weaponry is]{.underline}**
not always as technically advanced as America's, but it is **[good
enough for the needs of many markets, and is often far better than what
the purchasing countries can build themselves]{.underline}**. **[Russian
weaponry is also a good choice for states on a budget]{.underline}**.
Moscow advertises this fact. For example, in early October 2015, days
after Russia's Syria intervention, Moscow fired 26 cruise missiles from
primarily small corvettes in the Caspian Sea to hit targets in Syria.15
Moscow made a public display of the event, not only to demonstrate
Russia's own might but also to show other countries they need not
purchase a large expensive warship to achieve strong naval capabilities,
and that Moscow would be happy to help them achieve this goal.

#### Even if the tech is less desirable, demand will be high because Russia places far fewer regulations and preconditions on its sale

**Borshchevskaya '17** \[Anna Borshchevskaya is a Senior Fellow at The
Washington Institute, focusing on Russia\'s policy toward the Middle
East and is also a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University; In
addition, she is a fellow at the European Foundation for Democracy and

Middle East," 12/13/17,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/opeds/Borshchevskaya20171222-Jamestown.pdf>\]

Beyond these advantages, **[Russian weaponry comes with few strings
attached, in contrast to arms sales from Washington.]{.underline}**
**[Moscow, unlike the US, does not prohibit secondary arms
sales]{.underline}**. This means, for example, that when the US sells
weapons to Egypt, the weapon must stay in Egypt.18 But **[in Egypt's
context, buying a Russian weapon it can easily resell to someone else
for profit may be a preferable option]{.underline}**. **[Moscow also
does not burden arms sales with preconditions]{.underline}**, such as
mandated improvements of human rights. In addition, **[many in the MENA
find Russia easier to deal with]{.underline}**---no one needs to worry
about falling afoul of a theoretical Russian equivalent of the US
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, for example. **[Thus, countries turn to
Moscow when they wish to signal to Washington that they have other
options if they do not like the United States'
pre-conditions]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[some]{.underline}**
Arab **[states are genuinely interested in diversifying supplies away
from the US]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[after the 1991 Gulf War, several
GCC states bought Russian systems]{.underline}**. The West should not
discount Arab countries making such decisions. Russia, unlike the
America, invests effort across the MENA region to sell weapons systems.
Western analysts tend to point out Russia could never replace the United
States. Nevertheless, such views discount another option: **[Moscow does
not have to replace the US. Other authoritarian leaders can choose to
move closer to Russia because the Kremlim offers]{.underline}** Arab
states **[different advantages including quicker delivery and better
negotiating terms.]{.underline}** When it comes to arms sales in the
MENA region, **[Moscow has made major inroads during the Putin era with
Iran, Syria, Egypt, Libya and Algeria, and to a lesser extent with
Turkey, Iraq, and elsewhere in the Arab Persian Gulf. It is also making
small inroads with Tunisia and Morocco.]{.underline}**

### Russia -- A2: Sanctions Prevent Sales 

#### Sanctions won't hamper Russian fill-in

**Tlis '19** \[Fatima Tlis, "Russian Prime Minister Claims Country's
Arms Exports Not Affected by Sanctions," 4/23/19, Polygraph -- Partially

cs\]

Speaking to the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, on
April 17, **[Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the international
sanctions imposed on Moscow beginning in 2012 had no negative effect on
the country's arms trade. He claimed Russia's military exports totaled
\$54.5 billion and went to more than 100 countries]{.underline}**.
**[Medvedev is correct in stating that the arms industry is the sector
of the Russian economy least affected by sanctions]{.underline}**,
**[including the U.S. restrictions targeting Russia\'s Defense industry
and EU arms embargo imposed in 2014.]{.underline}** **[Russia remains
second largest seller of arms]{.underline}** globally, **[with a 21
percent share of the international market]{.underline}**, behind the
United States. Russia's arms exports apparently benefited from a
horrific act \--the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) in
July 2014, which killed all 298 civilians aboard the jetliner. The Joint
Investigation Team said Russia was responsible, and identified the
Russian Buk missile, and the Russian military unit to which the
individual missile was assigned. In the years following the 2014
downing, the maker of the Russian Buk TELAR surface-to-air missile,
enjoyed a boost in global sales. A Defense News ranking in 2018 found
the maker of the missile, JSC Almaz-Antey, scored a 39% increase from
\$6.58 billion in 2016 to \$9.1 billion in 2018. Still, the numbers
cited by Medvedev are not verifiable independently. **[The \$ 54.5
billion]{.underline}**, Medvedev cited as the value of Russia's military
exports \-- **[is not confirmed]{.underline}** by independent sources.

### China -- Internal -- Heg 

#### Chinese exports to the middle east undermine U.S. power projection

Latifa A. **Al Saud** (graduate student in the Department of Political

Relations and her research interests focus on the political and security
factors of East Asia-Middle East relations) 12/3/**2018** \["China's
Arms Sales Philosophy in the Arab World" online @

loghry\]

**[China's commercial motives do not suggest a]{.underline}** complete
**[lack of interest in influencing the region]{.underline}** and
maintaining political stability. China is the world's largest oil
importer of Saudi oil, and as such, **[stability in the Middle East is
critical to China]{.underline}**. Chinese arms sales to the region is
arguably motivated to maintain oil flows from friendly leaders from Arab
oil exporting states and a necessary tool for China to foster and
enhance energy ties. **[It is no coincidence that the major oil
exporting countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, and
Iran, are all purchasing weapons from China]{.underline}**. The
commercial nature of Chinese arms sales gives it short-term and
long-term advantages. Commercially, arms sales not only foster stronger
economic ties with Arab states, to which China remains dependent on
their oil exports, but also give China a chance to ask for a decrease in
the cost of importing energy from the region. China has the ability to
use arms sales as leverage to receive low oil prices and/or concessions,
an important tool given its significant growth in oil demand and
dependency on imports. U.S. and **[Western policymakers]{.underline}**
and scholars **[view increased Chinese arms sales to the region
as]{.underline}** not merely economically motivated, but also
**[intended for China's own]{.underline}** **[power
projection]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[mitigation of U.S.
power]{.underline}** **[in the region]{.underline}**. China often
criticizes U.S. interference in Middle East affairs, including the
strong presence of U.S. forces in the Gulf (and beyond). The primary
objectives for the US, from China's view, are to maintain, control, and
ensure access to energy resources in the region. Chinese actions to
cooperate with both U.S. and non-U.S. allies, like Iran and Syria, are
intended to, at least in part, exert its own influence. In 1991, the
Chinese provided Iran with sophisticated dual use nuclear technology and
natural uranium under the umbrella of nuclear "cooperation." This, among
other factors, allowed China to build up its image as an attractive and
easy to deal with arms provider, serving an entry point to its long-term
strategic presence without appearing to have an interest in picking
sides. Arms sales are part of China's win-win cooperation and
strategy-based foreign policy. Doing so is a rather unconventional
approach to international arms sales, as they have traditionally been
used as a political tool, with the United States as the top player.
China's approach can help its long-term strategic posture in the region
by promoting stronger ties with the Arab states, ensuring oil flows, and
opening a door to economic expansion in the Middle East through
investments and Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). **[Although there are
no recent instances of China using arms sales to exert influence in the
Middle East, this does not mean that the commercial nature of Chinese
arms sales is not also linked to national security interests. The
Chinese government's arms exports philosophy stems from its interest to
maintain strategic relations with the Arab states in order to best
increase its prospects for securing its business and energy interests in
the region]{.underline}**, regardless of the recipients' country's
intensions. It can therefore be said that PRC arms sales are exemplified
in Xi Jinping's overall win-win, cooperation-based foreign policy and
can in turn have key implications to understanding the global arms trade
of this century.

### Russia -- Impact -- Baltics

#### If U.S. Leadership declines, Putin invades the Baltics

**Wilson '15** -- MPA @ Princeton, American foreign policy advisor and
the current executive vice president at the Atlantic Council of the
United States, Deputy Director of the Private Office of the NATO
Secretary General, decorated by the Presidents of Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia and Poland for his efforts to advance transatlantic relations
(Damon, "A Transatlantic Strategy to Deter Putin's Aggression," *US
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and
Regional Security Cooperation*, Lexis)

This crisis began long before Crimea. Indeed, **[Russia\'s annexation of
Crimea was the natural outcome of a clear, consistent policy dating back
years]{.underline}**. I detail this record in my full testimony. Second,
**[Putin will not stop until he encounters serious
pushback]{.underline}**. Third, **[only the United States can galvanize
Europe]{.underline}** and the international community around an
effective strategy to **[deter Putin]{.underline}** for the **[long
term]{.underline}**. Fourth, any strategy should urgently and decisively
back Ukraine, as well as other vulnerable states with significant
economic and military assistance in the short term, while keeping the
door open to the European Union or NATO. And fifth, we should neither
abandon the Russian people nor the vision that a democratic Russia one
day can find its peaceful place within a Europe whole and free.
**[Putin\'s strategy has been to use this crisis to consolidate his own
hold]{.underline}** at home through greater oppression of civil society
and independent media even as he fuels nationalist fervor. He has
created an environment of fear and intimidation fostering the
circumstances that led to the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. Putin, of
course, is also seeking to dominate his neighbors, to drain them of
resources to fuel his kleptocracy, and to restore a sense of Russia\'s
greatness in the only way a bully knows. He aims to prevent his
neighbors from joining either NATO or the EU, **[achieving this through
coercion when possible and by dismemberment and occupation when
necessary]{.underline}**. Ultimately **[Putin knows that the best check
on his power is a united transatlantic community]{.underline}**, **[and
he has sought to divide Europe]{.underline}**, undermining the resolve
for sustained sanctions. But the most tempting objective for Putin is to
call into question the credibility of NATO\'s Article 5 mutual defense
commitment as doing so would effectively end NATO. **[A Russian move
against an ally]{.underline}**, such as **[a Baltic State, cannot be
ruled out. Putin has demonstrated time and again that if he senses an
opportunity to act he will]{.underline}**, **[convinced that the West
lacks the will or the ability to take decisive action]{.underline}**.
That is why today\'s situation is dangerous. We have seen repeatedly
that **[Putin\'s objectives expand with success and contract with
failure.]{.underline}** This means that **[the best determinant of his
action is Western action]{.underline}**. There is a tendency, however,
to argue that the Europeans should take the lead on Ukraine. After all,
we have our hands full with ISIS and other global responsibilities. But
the Ukraine crisis is a Russia crisis, and Russia is too big, too
strong, and too scary for Europe to resolve this without us. **[Without
U.S. leadership, Europe may feel forced to accommodate a revanchist
Russia, and we have seen throughout history this is a dangerous
formula]{.underline}**. **[The United States has the ability to rally
its allies and international partners around a comprehensive strategy
that not only deters Putin\'s aggression, but avoids an unstable gray

articulating what we want to achieve. We should more decisively increase
the cost to Russia, including by enacting sectorial sanctions and
targeting Gazprom and Putin directly.

#### EU-Russia war [escalates]{.underline} and goes [nuclear]{.underline} 

**Drury '17** -- journalist for VICE, citing Ian Shield, associate
lecturer in international relations at Anglia Ruskin University,
Vladimir Zhirinovsky who is a Russian lawmaker, Keri Giles, associate
fellow with the UK foreign-policy think tank Chatham House, a RAND study
(Colin, "What Would Happen if Russia and Europe Went to War?," VICE,
<https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xe5a3/what-would-happen-if-russia-and-europe-went-to-war>)

But **[peace is not inevitable]{.underline}**. If you think Europe
can\'t descend into a bar fight like drunks at closing time again, know
you\'re not the first to believe it. Some people dreamed something
similar during the Concert of Europe---a system put in place to uphold
the balance of power in the mid-19th century---and again in the four
decades of calm that followed the 1870--71 Franco-Prussian conflict. The
second period ended with WWI. So they misjudged that. Could we also have
misjudged the proximity of mass conflict in the 21st century? Some say
so. Security experts are increasingly investigating scenarios where a
stronger Russia on one side and Europe\'s NATO allies on the other go
from diplomatic tensions to full on slapping each other. This, they
stress, is unlikely. But if global events have taught us anything, it\'s
that **[unlikely doesn\'t mean impossible]{.underline}**. In fact, the
above could happen in three simple steps. One: Donald Trump makes good
on his hints and pulls the US out of NATO. Two: An emboldened Vladimir
**[Putin decides to help himself to the Baltic
states]{.underline}**---Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia---**[he has long
believed should be part of Russia]{.underline}**. Three: **[Given these
states have been NATO members since 2004, the rest of the alliance---the
UK, Germany, France, and others---go to their aid]{.underline}**. **[The
result? \"Hiroshimas and Nagasakis everywhere]{.underline}**,\" reckoned
the Russian lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky when discussing the
possibility last year. So that\'s not ideal. But could Russia and Europe
really go to war? And if they did, how would that work out? Be warned:
As Keir Giles, associate fellow with the UK foreign-policy think tank
Chatham House, that is a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization based
in London tells me, \"There\'s not much good news.\" WATCH: The Special
Ops Olympics---War Games 1. Tensions Rise **[Tensions between Russia and
Europe are always high. Even so, the present unease is
ominous.]{.underline}** On one hand, **[Russia has been holding major
nuclear drills for 40 million citizens, sending submarines into the
territorial waters of other nations and running mock bombing
missions]{.underline}** on the edge of British airspace. Forcibly
annexing part of another country, This behavior isn\'t generally viewed
as good neighborliness, either. Yet NATO isn\'t entirely averse to
mucking things up. The alliance has almost 10,000 troops in countries
that border Russia, while a two-week war game featuring thousands of
personnel and 50 aircrafts is being held in Scotland right now. The
enemy state in such rehearsals is often given a somewhat unambiguous
name: the Reds. 2. The Flash Point It\'s not wildly anti-Russian to say
the current administration favors the countries that border the Baltic
Sea---Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Putin believes these former Soviet
states should never have become independent: Each has a large Russian
population and strategically excellent sea ports. He\'s certainly not
keen on them being NATO members and sees the alliance---not without
rationale---as encircling Russia. \"If you compress a spring,\" he
warned in 2014, \"eventually it will snap back.\" With America gone,
that snap back could happen instantly. \"They would move on the Baltic
states more or less immediately,\" says Giles, who is also director of
the Conflict Studies Research Center in Oxfordshire. \"Putin believes
Russian security requires the Baltic states under its domain. But you
need to look further. It\'s hard to put a definitive border on how far
**[ambitious Russians think the frontier should expand. But certainly
you\'re looking at Poland and Finland too]{.underline}**.\" 3. Internet
Down! Shots Fired! Photo by Sean MacEntee via Flickr In 2015, a study by
research institute the RAND Corporation concluded **[it would take just
60 hours for Russia to overrun Lithuania]{.underline}**, Latvia, and
Estonia. Giles, however, believes the signs would be there sometime in
advance. \"**[There would be a noticeable rise in Russian diplomacy and
media focusing on issues that could give rationale for an armed
intervention,\"]{.underline}** he says. **[On some pretense, such as a
peacekeeping mission, thousands of troops would gather on the
border]{.underline}**. In the days before any invasion or attack, **[the
target\'s internet would be shut down]{.underline}** or disrupted by
specialist telecommunications soldiers. Power supplies would fail, and
ATMs would stop functioning. Cellphones and TV signals would be jammed.
Perhaps most ominously, **[personalized texts would be sent direct to
opposition officials, soldiers, and citizens, creating
confusion]{.underline}** and panic. In some cases, these texts would
appear to come from someone already in the recipient\'s phone book. \"In
the right circumstances, this could be enough,\" says Giles. \"Russia
doesn\'t need to roll tanks across a border. They can stage an attack
without a military presence. **[Misinformation and civil disorder could
lead to regime change with a client government of Moscow taking
charge]{.underline}**. That would meet Russia\'s security and economic
objectives.\" And if no such regime change happened? Think hybrid
warfare: all the above combined with the sudden movement of troops into
the country. \"We don\'t know how exactly an occupation would look, but
**[Russia does practice this scenario]{.underline}**,\" says Giles.
\"What we do know is it would be over pretty swiftly.\" 4. NATO: Fight
or Fall Once diplomacy fails, the hard fact is that a US-less NATO
almost certainly doesn\'t have the firepower to win a war with Russia.
We\'ll ignore nuclear weapons for now and keep things conventional.
Russia has more men (the reserves alone are 2.5 million strong) and
hardware. As a single country, its chain of command is better
streamlined. Soldiers are battle-hardened from Ukraine and Syria. After
a decade of \$40 billion-a-year military upgrades, its weaponry---such
as the Pantsir-S1, a tank that can literally destroy cruise
missiles---is superior too. It\'s also possible some NATO members would
withdraw---in particular Turkey, given the warm relationship between
President Putin and President Recep Erdoğan. That\'s 600,000 men---the
second-biggest contingent after the US---gone. The result would be the
last of NATO facing an existential decision: Fight and probably lose,
or, in this scenario, cut the Baltic states loose. Or, as Ian Shield,
associate lecturer in international relations at Anglia Ruskin
University, puts it: \"The choice would be between reneging on the
treaty---which would certainly lead to the disintegration of NATO and
probably, by extension, the whole European order---or participating in a
cataclysmic war extending up to nuclear weapons.\" Rock and a hard
place, basically. 5. War on the Ground Ballistic short range missiles.
Photo via Wikimedia Let\'s carry on gaming, though, and say NATO engages
Russia. How does that go? Not well for either side, says Shields: \"On
any battlefield, **[there would be
annihilation]{.underline}**---although these wouldn\'t be battlefields
like we have previously known. Missiles and artillery have far greater
range and precision, meaning enemy posts, infrastructure, armories, and
even entire towns could be destroyed from within home territory. What
you have is fewer individual battles but far greater destruction. If
neither side backed down, **[entire swathes of
Europe]{.underline}**---it\'s impossible to know where---**[would be
reduced to rubble. The death tolls would be
unimaginable]{.underline}**.\" **[Britain wouldn\'t be
safe]{.underline}**; the English Channel has become a hopelessly
outdated moat. \"Russian aircrafts wouldn\'t need to even enter British
airspace,\" says Shields. \"They could land precision strikes from well
outside.\" **[Both sides would wrestle for control of the seas around
Scandinavia. Cyber attacks, meanwhile, could shut down transport
infrastructure, hospitals, media, and utilities]{.underline}**.
Russia\'s main advantage amid the carnage would be two-fold. First,
because it has more weaponry and men, it can, essentially, keep blasting
away longer. Second, its sheer landmass means it could better absorb the
devastation: NATO could wipe out every single structure hundreds of
miles into its adversary\'s territory, and Moscow wouldn\'t even be
scratched. 6. Going Nuclear As any history student knows, it doesn\'t
matter if you have 7,000 nuclear weapons (Russia) or 200 (Britain and
France); their cataclysmic qualities level things up. The thought goes
that the pressing of the red button means MAD: mutually assured
destruction. **[If one side starts throwing warheads about, the other
responds in kind]{.underline}**. Both adversaries are wiped out. Right?
Wrong. \"What Russia has in its arsenal that the West doesn\'t is
tactical nuclear weapons,\" explains Giles. \"These are not big
city-leveling nukes, but ones that can destroy battlefields or
neighborhoods. The West had these weapons but got rid of them. So its
only response to a tactical nuclear strike would be a full nuclear
attack. Which is self-defeating because it would also ensure their own
destruction. The West is missing several rungs on the escalation ladder
that Russia has built into its strategy.\" Nonetheless, **[once things
go nuclear, it all becomes unpredictable: cities wiped out, millions
dead. At this point, even the most advanced strategists tend to stop
plotting possible paths]{.underline}**. 7. But Cheer Up If the US
leaving NATO is a gateway to Armageddon, the good news is it seems
increasingly unlikely. Trump probably won\'t ditch the alliance. That\'s
because it doesn\'t only keep the US secure; it\'s also politically and
economically advantageous. It gives Washington influence in Europe and
protects a vast and prosperous continent that---and this is
important---spends much of its wealth with American companies. That
said, maybe **[it\'s still worth remembering peace here really does hang
by threads]{.underline}**. Maybe go out and play more.

**[The United States has the most diverse export portfolio in the
world]{.underline}**. In the past five years, **[it has delivered
weapons to nearly 100 countries]{.underline}**. **[Its best
customer]{.underline}** over this period, **[Saudi Arabia, only bought
13 percent of all U.S. arms exports]{.underline}** (all data from
SIPRI). By contrast, **[58 percent of Russia exports go to just three
countries]{.underline}** (India, China, and Vietnam). **[For China, it's
64 percent]{.underline}** (Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Algeria). Strong
domestic demand also mitigates the pressure on a country to export. From
2010 to 2015 the United Kingdom, France, and Germany all exported about
half of their defense production, while Russia exported 39 percent. The
United States on average exports only a quarter of the arms produced by
its firms. **[This combination of strong domestic demand and a diverse
portfolio of client states makes America's market power stronger than
that of any other exporter]{.underline}**. **[The United States is so
economically advantaged in making and selling weapons that it can limit
conventional-weapons proliferation, technology diffusion, and corruption
in contracting arrangements (and maintain a robust defense industrial
base) while retaining its commanding market position. Less powerful

production to pursue any goals besides increased sales. There are a
number of ways in which America's leverage in the area of arms sales ---
and, therefore, its ability to exercise restraint --- can further its
foreign policy goals]{.underline}**.

WASHINGTON \-- **[The United States remained far and above the rest of
the world as the globe's leading arms exporter, with Russia
a]{.underline}** **[distant second]{.underline}**, a leading research
group says. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)
said in a March 11 report that **[the gap between the United States and
the rest of the world]{.underline}** **[widened further]{.underline}**
**[in the most recent five-year period]{.underline}** of 2014-18, with
American exports rising to 36 percent of the global total from 30
percent in the previous period. **[\"The U.S.A. has further solidified
its position as the world's leading arms supplier,"]{.underline}** said
Aude Fleurant, director of the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure
Program. **[\"\[It\] exported arms to at least 98 countries in the past
five years]{.underline}**; these deliveries often included advanced
weapons such as combat aircraft, short-range cruise and ballistic
missiles, and large numbers of guided bombs.\" The report highlighted
the widening gap between Washington and Moscow in arms exports. **["U.S.
exports of major arms were 75 percent higher than Russia's in the
2014--18 period, while they were only 12 percent higher in
2009-13]{.underline}**," SIPRI said in its report of global arms
transfers. "More than half (52 percent) of U.S. arms exports went to the
Middle East in 2014-18," it added. SIPRI said Russia's arms exports fell
17 percent in the 2014-18 period, with a reduction in arms imports by
India and Venezuela the major factors in the decline. The report said
**[France]{.underline}** (6.8 percent of the world total) **[was the
third-highest arms exporter, followed by Germany]{.underline}** (6.4
percent), **[and China]{.underline}** (5.2 percent).

### Both -- Feasibility 

#### Countries can't just switch to new arms suppliers -- transition costs in training and materiel just too high

While **[it's true that Russia and China are]{.underline}** indeed
**[major exporters of armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily
be replaced by other suppliers is not]{.underline}** -- at least not in
the short term. First, **[once a country is "locked in" to a specific
kind of weapons system]{.underline}**, such as planes, tanks or naval
vessels, **[the cost to switch to a different supplier can be
huge]{.underline}**. **[Military personnel must be retrained on new
equipment, spare parts need to be replaced, and operational changes may
be necessary]{.underline}**. **[After being so reliant on U.S. weapons
systems for decades, the transition costs to buy from another country
could be prohibitive]{.underline}** even for oil-rich Saudi Arabia. The
second problem with Trump's argument is that **[armaments from Russia,
China or elsewhere are simply not as sophisticated as U.S. weapons,
which is why they are usually cheaper]{.underline}** -- though the
quality gap is quickly decreasing. To maintain its military superiority
in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase virtually all of
its weapons from American and European companies.

**[and]{.underline}**, if done indiscriminately, **[undermine what
should be the central goal of the nation's arms transfer policy:

States, while some of the most lucrative, job-creating arms deals can
undermine U.S. interests]{.underline}**.

### China -- Post Brink

#### The U.S. has squandered its arms sales lead -- China already cornering the market for most sought after exports: drones.

Jakob **Reinmann** (contributor to Foreign Policy In Focus)
2/18/**2019** \["China is Flooding the Middle East With Cheap Drones"
online @ 2, loghry\]

**[The last great revolution on the world's battlefields began with the
advent of the drone era]{.underline}**. Particularly in the Middle East,
**[the drone became the symbol of the U.S. empire operating in a legal
vacuum]{.underline}**. In the first decade and a half of the "War on
Terror," the U.S. still had a virtual monopoly on the risk-free
execution from thousands of meters above --- but once the genie is out
of the bottle, every attempt to squeeze it back in is notoriously doomed
to failure. And so, **[quickly other countries in the region aspired
after the financially --- and politically --- cheap execution by
drone]{.underline}**. The number of armies with their own drone fleet is
growing rapidly. A multi-billion-dollar market with astronomical growth
rates opened up --- demand that's essentially served only by one actor:
China. **[The U.S. has squandered its lead The appearance of the Rainbow
CH-4 --- the driving force of Chinese combat drones --- is almost
identical to the notorious Reaper drone of the U.S.]{.underline}** arms
manufacturer General Atomics. While the CH-4 lags behind the Reaper in
most performance parameters, it can keep up with or even outperform its
competitor in some of them. Also, the CH-4's weaponry, the AKD-10
warhead, is almost identical to the Reaper's Hellfire missiles. **[The
striking similarity follows a strategy of Chinese engineering well-known
from cell phones or cars: the look of a world-famous Western branded
product is copied with an inferior but sufficiently good quality
compared to that of the original]{.underline}** --- but at significantly
less cost. Chinese drones are 50 to 75 percent cheaper than the
originals from the U.S. A late 2015 article published in the Asia Times
suggests that this copying of U.S. technology is likely rooted in
Beijing's data theft. According to records by world-famous NSA
whistleblower Edward Snowden, by 2010 alone "Chinese hackers had
conducted more than 30,000 cyber attacks" on Pentagon computer networks
and other U.S. military agencies in order to "exfiltrate \[data on\]
sensitive military technology." Although there is no final proof that
data on drones were skimmed off too, Asia Times quotes then NSA director
Gen. Keith Alexander, who suggests that **[it is highly likely that the
Reaper blueprints were part of the Chinese data hack, while military
experts and analysts largely share this view]{.underline}**. With the
latest model --- the CH-7, which is still in the development phase ---
**[China could possibly pull ahead the U.S. for the first
time]{.underline}**, military journal Defense One explains. **[The CH-7
"will be the sole option for buyers wanting to field stealth combat
drones,"]{.underline}** it predicts. **["The United States had a
decade-plus head start on \[drone\] technology,"]{.underline}** says
military expert Paul Scharre, **["and has unfortunately]{.underline}**
**[squandered that lead]{.underline}**."

### China -- Alt Cause -- Drones

#### China is the leader in armed drone sales already, which is sufficient to trigger the DA's impacts

Jakob **Reinmann** (contributor to Foreign Policy In Focus)
2/18/**2019** \["China is Flooding the Middle East With Cheap Drones"
online @ 2, loghry\]

China captures the market **[For a long time, it was only the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Israel that had combat drones and used
them to execute alleged terrorists]{.underline}** --- something that has
changed dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, **[the number of
countries with combat drones has swelled to at least 29,]{.underline}**
as research organization New America identifies. **[And 10 countries
have demonstrably used them to kill suspected enemies]{.underline}**; in
addition to the three mentioned, there is Iran, Azerbaijan, the UAE, as
well as Nigeria, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey (the last four countries
drone-killed people on their own soil). Historically, Israel is the
largest drone exporter, with a market share of over 60 percent in the
last three decades. More recently, from 2008-2017, China exported a
total of 88 drones to at least 12 countries, ranking third among the
world's drone exporters behind the United States (351) and Israel (186).
However, **[while the vast majority of U.S. and Israeli exports are made
up of unarmed reconnaissance drones, China's sales focus on armed
drones]{.underline}**. During the mentioned period, China exported 68
combat drones, putting it ahead of the U.S. (62) and Israel (56).
Foreign Policy thus recently titled rightly: "China Has Already Won the
Drone Wars." All of the armed forces of the Chinese military have large
fleets of various drones, but Beijing has used them so far only for
disaster relief, surveillance of domestic critics, and military
reconnaissance --- not to kill. (In 2013, Beijing considered executing
by drone a Myanmar drug baron wanted in the murders of 13 Chinese
sailors, but eventually caught and tried him.) Rather, **[Beijing
appears to be establishing a norm permanently prohibiting lethal drone
strikes in East and South Asia. However, this no-shoot dogma does not
prevent the Chinese arms industry from exporting their drones to states
that are patently using them for killing elsewhere]{.underline}**.

### Russia -- Uniqueness Answers

#### UQ Overwhelms -- Russia arms sales high globally now

**Kruglov '19** \[ALEXANDER KRUGLOV, 4/21/19, "Business booming for
Russia's arms traders," Asia Times,
<https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/04/article/business-booming-for-russias-arms-traders/>,
cs\]

In a high-profile spat, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has
acknowledged he is buying S-400 missile defense systems, a deal that has
put Ankara on a collision course with Nato and Washington and
complicated the country's deal to buy F35 stealth jets from the United
States.

**[This Ankara-Washington stand-off]{.underline}** over the sale of
Russian missiles and Erdogan's obvious commitment to go ahead with the
deal **[make clear how Moscow's aggressive arms trade is offering the
Kremlin new opportunities to strengthen its position, influence and
foothold the world over. Turkey is only one of the
markets]{.underline}** for Moscow's arms traders. According to the
latest annual report by The Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) for 2018, **[Russia has surpassed Britain as the
number two arms producer and trader in the world, behind perennial
number one, the US. Combined sales]{.underline}** of Russia's arms and
military services **[rose 8.5%]{.underline}** from a year earlier,
**[reaching an unprecedented US\$37.7 billion.]{.underline}** Also,
according to SIRPI, the largest arms-producing company in Russia,
**[state-owned Almaz-Antey, for the first time entered the top 10 in the
global arms sales ranking.]{.underline}** 'Arsenal of communism'
Russia's leading export is energy, its second is weaponry. The USSR, as
the "arsenal of communism," was long a maker of classic weapons, from
the T34 -- the outstanding tank of World War II -- and the Katyusha
multiple rocket launcher to the Kalashnikov assault rifle and MIG and
Sukhoi warplanes. Following the break-up of the USSR, Russia's military
budget shrank six-fold. Potentially catastrophically, arms makers lost
many of their top customers -- the Eastern European member states of the
Warsaw Pact. That forced producers to refocus on global sales. Even so,
old partnerships in other parts of the world endured. Russia's
manufacturers of effective and reliable arms have been given a powerful
shot in the arm by President Vladimir Putin. The macho national leader's
injection blends industrial policy, R&D policy and foreign policy with
personal testosterone. With Putin an arms fetishist himself -- he has
been filmed watching tanks going through their paces at proving grounds,
firing pistols, visiting the Kalashnikov factory, interacting with fully
geared-up special forces, even cruising in a jet fighter in full
paraphernalia -- Russian arms manufacturers benefit from a highly
prominent global marketer like no other. The main focus is on Asia and
the Middle East. **[Russia sells 43.1% of its weapons to Asia and more
than 20% to the Middle East.]{.underline}** Chinese market The top
priority is China. While Chinese troops used Russian arms as early as
the Korean War in the 1950s, the roots of current Moscow-Beijing
cooperation in the sector date back to the turbulent early 1990s. China
was Russia's largest client between 1999 and 2006, accounting annually
for 34% to 60% of Russia's weapon exports, according to Russia's Far
East Institute. **[In 2015]{.underline}**, after years of negotiations,
**[Beijing-Moscow cooperation ramped up a level when Russia finally
agreed to sell China some of its most advanced arms: 24 Sukhoi Su 35
combat aircraft and four S-400 SAM systems for approximately \$7 billion
within the next five years.]{.underline}** Then there's Asia's other
rising demographic superpower, **[India]{.underline}**, which
**[acquires 62% of all its arms from Russia]{.underline}**. Russia is
providing a range of equipment, from tanks to fighter aircraft to
frigates. India has now overtaken China as the largest buyer of Russian
weapons in the world, having purchased more than \$4 billion worth of
arms in 2017, according to Russia's Oriental Studies Institute. But
**[the emerging]{.underline}** Asian **[market for Russian hardware is
Southeast Asia, where, from 2006 to 2015, military spending rose by an
average of 57%]{.underline}**, according to Aseantoday website. Arms for
Asean **[As soon as Air Marshall Yuyu Sutisna was sworn in as
Indonesia's new Air Force Chief of Staff last year, he announced the
purchase of 11 new SU-35s. And that's just the beginning.]{.underline}**
The Russians are anticipating future great deals. **[Vietnam, Indonesia
and Cambodia more than doubled their military purchases.]{.underline}**
Vietnam increased spending on arms seven-fold from 2006 to 2016. Now
Hanoi is the eighth biggest arms importer globally. "All that is a
response to national security threats of countries in the region,"
explained Petr Brigin, a Vietnam expert at Vostochnaya Politika, a
Moscow think tank. "Vietnam, for example, is spending heavily on naval
weaponry -- in response to China's moves in the South China Sea. **["In
Thailand]{.underline}**, dealing with an insurgency in the south of the
country, **[there's a strong demand for land-based arms -- so the Royal
Thai Armed Forces placed an order for new AK rifles."]{.underline}**
Between 2000 and 2016, Vietnam imported more than 80% of its arms from
Russia, rejuvenating an old partnership -- the country deployed Warsaw
Pact weapons in its struggle against the United States. The Vietnamese
military, facing off against China in the South China Sea, recently
purchased 12 SU-35 fighter-jets and boosted its navy with highly
advanced Russian-Indian Brahmos cruise missiles and six diesel
submarines. **[Myanmar and Laos bought between 60% and 80% of their
weapons from Russia]{.underline}**. Why buy Russian? **[Because not only
are these weapons technologically advanced, they are cheaper and don't
require the political sign off that arms from Moscow's main rival
do.]{.underline}** Human rights criteria must be met before the US
Congress approves arms sales, but Russian weapons come with no such
baggage. **[In 2016, the Philippines placed an order for 26,000
automatic rifles from the US. Those rifles never arrived,]{.underline}**
as Congress refused to approve the sale over suspicions that President
Rodrigo Duterte might use the weapons against his own people in his war
on drugs. **[As a result, Moscow stepped in and supplied the Philippines
with 5,000 AK-74M rifles, one million items of ammunition and 20
trucks.]{.underline}** "Selling weapons to Asian countries perfectly
fits Putin's foreign policy objectives," said Alexei Sidorov, an
independent Moscow-based analyst who specializes in Southeast Asia.
"Putin is trading weaponry with rivals in the South China Sea," he
added, a reference to the fact that both Hanoi and Beijing were
customers of Moscow's armorers. "This gives Moscow more leverage and
political influence in the region." The Syrian showcase
**[The]{.underline}** ever-troubled, oil-rich **[Middle East is also
high on Moscow's agenda]{.underline}**. It is a promising market --
**[arms imports by Middle Eastern states rose 87% over the last four
years]{.underline}**, accounting for 35% of global arms imports,
according to SIPRI. Russia has been trying to make inroads into the
prosperous Gulf states, a market dominated for decades by US arms
producers. More than half of all US weapons sold go to the Middle East.
**[To win over new customers from the Gulf, Russian companies in recent
years have boosted their presence at the major airshows and defense
exhibitions in the Middle East]{.underline}**, like IDEX in Abu Dhabi
and the Dubai Airshow. In the region, Moscow deploys a special sales
pitch. The Russian military has showcased the best it has to offer in
its largely successful military intervention in Syria, a theater that
has provided a proving ground for the weaponry. Between 60 and 200
weapons have been tested in Syria in real combat. These include the
supersonic strategic bomber the Tu-160, the Su-34 fighter-jet and the
first Russian stealth fighter, the Su-57. Older generation T-90 tanks
and Ka-52 attack helicopters have also proven their worth. **[Egypt is
traditionally a leading buyer of Russian arms]{.underline}**. Moscow has
actively sought to upgrade relations with Cairo, through subtle
diplomacy and high-profile official visits -- in 2015, Putin was the
first major leader to meet with President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi after he
assumed office. During Putin's second visit in 2017, several landmark
agreements were signed. Nowadays, Cairo is the leading Russian arms
buyer in Africa, with annual weapons purchases estimated at more than
\$1.3 billion, according to data from Moscow University's Asian-African
Institute. Long-range arms sales **[Moscow arms players also boast a
strong foothold in Latin America]{.underline}**. Many regional nations
-- particularly those aligned against the United States -- are familiar
with Soviet weapons from the Cold War days and are drawn by low price
tags. **[Cuba, Peru, Venezuela and Nicaragua are at the top of the list
for Russian arms sales companies.]{.underline}** According to SIPRI,
**[between 2000 and 2017, the Russian share of arms sales to Latin
America was about 20%, on par with the US share.]{.underline}**
Nicaragua is central. Since 2000, Russia has supplied 100% of Nicaraguan
weapons' needs. Venezuela is also heavily dependent on Russian arms
supplies, which make up about 69% of Venezuela's arms purchases --
aircraft, transport and combat helicopters, anti-tank missiles,
anti-aircraft systems, rocket artillery and mortars. **[Russia also has
a foothold in Brazil]{.underline}**, where about 7% of arms sales are
Russian. Since 2010, Russia has delivered Mi-35M combat helicopters and
SA-24 portable surface-to-air missiles. Sometimes Russian arms sales are
found in unexpected places. Recently, following the ouster of Sudanese
dictator Al-Bashir, it was reported in Moscow press that Russia had been
selling arms to the regime for more than 20 years.

cs\]

MOSCOW \-- **[Russia is ramping up its weapons sales to Southeast and
South Asia]{.underline}**, with Moscow **[overtaking Britain as the
world\'s second-largest exporter. The Kremlin\'s aggressive sales
campaign has raised fears of an arms race in]{.underline}** Canberra and
**[Washington]{.underline}**, where the Trump administration has
unveiled its own \"buy American\" effort to sell more U.S. weapons
systems worldwide. **[The Asia-Pacific is a theater of intensifying
rivalry between the two military superpowers]{.underline}**, partly
fueled by countries buying arms to counter security threats from Chinese
naval expansion in the South China Sea but also from international
terrorist groups. **[Russia \-- the largest arms exporter to the region
\-- is supplying missile defense systems, tanks and fighter jets to
countries ranging from India to Laos and Vietnam]{.underline}**. Russia
was the largest supplier of arms for the region from 2013 to 2017,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In
January, Russia delivered four Yak-130 fighter jets to Laos based on a
contract signed in 2017. In addition, Laos is being supplied with tanks,
lightly armored vehicles and other types of weapons, the Russian defense
ministry said. **[Russia was home to 10 of the world\'s 100 largest
weapons manufacturers in terms of sales in 2017]{.underline}**,
according to data released in December by SIPRI. **[Moscow\'s combined
sales amounted to \$37.7 billion, an 8.5% rise from the previous year
and representing 9.5% of overall global arms sales, which totaled
\$398.2 billion]{.underline}**. Russia\'s weapons shipments surpassed
Britain\'s \$35.7 billion, making it the second-largest arms seller,
after the U.S. Russia sold \$19 billion worth of weapons in 2018,
according to Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Rostec, the government-owned
industrial group that includes Russia\'s monopoly arms exporter in its
vast portfolio. \"Today Russia confidently holds second place in the
world by volume of military and technical cooperation,\" Chemezov was
quoted by Russia\'s Tass news agency as saying. He said that in 2018 the
country sold nearly 25% more in arms than the year before. **[Russian
military experts say the country\'s weapons carry lower price tags than
those from their Western counterparts]{.underline}**. It is believed
that Russia\'s military intervention in the civil war in Syria was
partly motivated by Moscow\'s desire to test and demonstrate the
performance of Russian arms. **[Even after international economic
sanctions were imposed on Russia]{.underline}** in response to its
invasion of Ukraine in 2014, **[arms exports have remained a steady
revenue]{.underline}** source for Moscow. **[Russia is prioritizing
Asia]{.underline}** in its arms export expansion drive. The region
absorbs over 60% of Russia\'s arms shipments, with most of them going to
Southeast Asia. Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of Vietnam\'s
Communist Party, visited Russia in September and struck a \$1 billion
arms deal with Moscow. President Vladimir Putin met with Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi in India in October and agreed to sell the
sophisticated S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system to the South
Asian country in a deal worth \$5 billion. **[Washington is concerned
that sales of Russian weapons systems, like the S-400 to India and other
countries in the region, could lead to U.S. military secrets being
leaked]{.underline}** to the Kremlin. The Countering America\'s
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act was introduced in 2017, aimed at
punishing Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections and
its actions in Ukraine. It prohibits any country from signing
\"significant\" defense deals with Russia. In September 2018, the U.S.
imposed secondary sanctions on the Chinese military for buying fighter
jets and S-400 system-related equipment from Russia. The Trump
administration\'s \"buy American\" policy aims to boost arms exports
worldwide. American arms sales to foreign governments rose 13% to \$192
billion in fiscal 2018 ended Sept. 30, according to the State
Department. Alexey Muraviev, associate professor of national security
and strategic studies at Curtin University in Australia, discussed
regional tensions in a commentary published in The Conversation, an
independent source of news and views sourced from academic and research
communities. **[\"After years of decline and neglect, Russian military
power in the Asia-Pacific region is making a major leap forward,\"
Muraviev wrote.]{.underline}** \"Russia is making its presence felt in
the region for the benefit of its regional allies and clients, and as a
form of deterrent to its geopolitical rivals,\" he said. \"The time has
come for us to appreciate a power north of the Great Wall,\" Muraviev
wrote.

### Russia -- Link Answers -- Middle East

#### No risk of country fill-in in the middle east -- too locked into particular systems

**Bershidsky '19** \[Leonid Bershidsky is the founding editor of the
Russian business daily Vedomosti and founded the opinion website

cs\]

**[Global arms sales are on the increase]{.underline}**, consistent with
the growing number of conflicts and deaths brought about by them. **[The
U.S. and its allies have been the main beneficiaries]{.underline}**.
**[Russia, by contrast, is on the decline]{.underline}**, a sign that
Vladimir **[Putin's geopolitical bets aren't turning into long-term
influence.]{.underline}** The world has grown significantly less violent
since 1950, but **[there has been an marked uptick in the number of
armed conflicts in recent years.]{.underline}** The emergence of Islamic
State, hostilities in eastern Ukraine, and the persecution of the
Rohingya in Myanmar are just some examples. The number of fatalities has
increased even more dramatically, according to the Uppsala Conflict Data
Program. Between 2011 and 2017, the average annual death toll from
conflict neared 97,000, three times more than in the previous seven-year
period. **[That helps to explain the 7.8 percent increase in
international arms transfers from 2014 to 2018 compared with the
previous five-year period]{.underline}** seen in the latest data from
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the global
authority on the weapons trade. **[The Middle East has been absorbing
weapons]{.underline}** at an alarming pace: **[The flow of armaments to
the region rocketed by 87 percent in the last five years.]{.underline}**
**[Russia took an active part in the bloodiest of the conflicts, but it
doesn't appear to have been able to convert this into more
sales]{.underline}**. **[It was the only one of the world's top five
exporters]{.underline}**, which together account for 75 percent of the
business, **[to suffer a major loss in market share]{.underline}**. It
remains the world's second-biggest arms exporter. SIPRI has its own,
rather complicated, system for calculating transfer volumes based on the
military value of the equipment traded rather than on its market price.
But **[in dollar terms, too, Russia trails the U.S.]{.underline}** Yury
Borisov, **[Russia's deputy prime minister in charge of the defense
industry, said]{.underline}** last month that **[Russia "steadily
reaches" \$15 billion]{.underline}** in arms exports a year **[and hopes
to retain that]{.underline}** amount. **[This suggests officials believe
sales have hit a ceiling.]{.underline}** By contrast, the U.S. closed
\$55.6 billion of arms deals in 2018, 33 percent more than in 2017,
thanks to the Trump administration's liberalization of weapons exports.
**[According to the SIPRI figures, U.S. exports were 75 percent higher
than Russia's in 2014 through 2018 -- a far wider gap than in the
previous five-year period.]{.underline}** For the U.S., Middle Eastern
countries have been especially important -- particularly Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest arms importer, and its major irritant, Qatar.
**[Some 52 percent of U.S. weapons sales were to the Middle East in the
last five years]{.underline}**. Under President Donald Trump, the
relationship with Saudi Arabia became even more lucrative for the
defense industry. **[For Russia, the Middle East accounted only for 16
percent of its weapons exports over the same period]{.underline}**, with
most going to Egypt and Iraq. Its major trade partners were India, China
and Algeria -- but sales to India dropped significantly as its
government sought to diversify suppliers and bought more from the U.S.,
South Korea and, most painfully for the Kremlin, Ukraine. **[Russia has
been losing key aircraft tenders in India to the U.S. This, along with
the economic collapse of another major client, Venezuela, and the
current potential for regime change in Algeria, all makes a rebound in
Russian sales look unlikely. Arms sales are perhaps the best reflection
of a major military power's international influence]{.underline}**.
**[The market isn't all about price and quality competition; it's about
permanent and situational alliances. The growing gap between the U.S.
and Russia in exports shows that Putin's forays into areas such as the
Middle East are failing to translate into Russian influence in the
region.]{.underline}** Although Putin's warm **[relations with Egyptian
President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi and his alliance with
Iran]{.underline}**, which has a lot of influence over Iraq, are paying
off to some extent, they **[can't]{.underline}** quite **[compensate for
ground lost elsewhere]{.underline}**. The **[U.S.'s allies, France,
Germany and the U.K. among them, have been rapidly increasing their
market share, too]{.underline}**. That's a rarely mentioned way in which
the security alliance with Washington is paying off for the Europeans.
All the ethical objections to selling arms to countries such as Saudi
Arabia notwithstanding, European Union member states need markets for
their defense industries, which employ about 500,000 people. Being under
the U.S. umbrella opens doors where Russia and China are less desirable
partners -- that is, in most of the world. Many tears have been shed in
the U.S. about the collapse of the American-led global order. But **[if
you take arms sales as a proxy for influence, the U.S.'s global
dominance looks to be resilient. In a more conflict-prone, competitive
world, America is doing rather well while its longstanding geopolitical
rivals stumble.]{.underline}**

Asked for a response, Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher, Arms and
Military Expenditure Programme at the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (Sipri), told IPS: "**[If]{.underline}**, \[very
hypothetical\] **[the USA]{.underline}** and the UK **[would stop
supplying arms to Saudi Arabia, this would be a major problem for Saudi
Arabia, in military and financial terms]{.underline}**." He pointed out
that **[Saudi Arabia would find it very hard to maintain the US and UK
weapons its armed forces largely rely on without the support of the
large numbers of US and UK service personnel in the country right
now]{.underline}**. The Saudi military might be able to keep the weapons
going for a while, but presumably at a much lower operational level. He
said **[it will not only be very costly for Saudi Arabia to replace the
expensive existing equipment --- which is supposed to be in service for
decades --- but it also means that Chinese and Russian weapons will not
be of as high quality as what Saudis now receive from the
US]{.underline}** and Western Europe. And New York Times roving
correspondent Nicholas Kristof says, "**[some Saudis kept trying to
suggest to me that if we block weapons sales to Riyadh, the kingdom will
turn to Moscow]{.underline}**." "**[That's absurd]{.underline}**. **[It
needs our spare parts and, more important, it buys our weapons because
they come with an implicit guarantee that we will bail the Saudis out
militarily if they get into trouble with Iran]{.underline}**."

### Russia -- Impact Defence

#### Baltic Adventurism Defense -- No WWIII

**Stangl '19** \[Maxwell Stang is a research assistant in the Department
of Military & Strategic Studies at the U.S. Air Force Academy, 5/13/19,
"Russia Won\'t Start a (Conventional) War in the Baltics," National
Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-wont-start-conventional-war-baltics-57317\]

**[Russia is simply not prepared or properly positioned to execute a
well-coordinated, conventional attack on the Baltics]{.underline}**.
**[The amount of Russian units in close proximity]{.underline}** to make
a rapid assault **[is limited, and most of these formations would take
significant time and resources to mobilize]{.underline}**. It **[would
require a large and complex movement]{.underline}** of troops, vehicles,
and equipment to successfully plan **[and]{.underline}** execute such an
operation. **[Such activity would]{.underline}** surely **[catch the eye
of NATO members, alerting them]{.underline}** to a likely invasion.
Instead, Russian posture is best suited for hybrid warfare against these
neighboring countries. A Glimpse of the Bear With the Baltic States on
Russia's Western border, the Western Military District (WMD) \[Западный
военный округ\] would be ultimately responsible for Russian military
operations in that region. These districts are similar to the United
States geographical combatant commands such as European Command (EUCOM)
and Central Command (CENTCOM), which have separate units and command
structures from multiple branches across specific regions. Russia's WMD
contains all units permanently present in the western-most part of the
country while also including the enclave of Kaliningrad bordering Poland
and Lithuania. Although it is comprised of naval, air, ground, cyber,
electronic, and nuclear capabilities, the number of assets in the region
and their locations simply do not lend themselves to making a surprise,
conventional assault on the Baltics. For instance, 2017 figures show
that there are twenty-two combat brigades and over 1,200 aircraft within
the vicinity of the Baltics, making it a very capable force. However,
these numbers do not tell the full story. **[Hypothetically, if Russia
were to conduct a combined-arms invasion of the Baltic States tomorrow,
only a small number of forces would be properly
positioned]{.underline}** to attack. There are plenty of armored and
mechanized units nearby, however, **[the only truly capable and quick
reaction military unit available for a surprise assault would be the
76th Guards Air Assault Division]{.underline}** (GAAD). Based in Pskov
only twenty miles from the border of Estonia, they could utilize cargo
aircraft (e.g. Il-76), and helicopters (e.g. Mi-8, Mi-17, and Mi-24) for
airborne operations, striking the Baltics with little warning.
Additionally, it is reported that the GAAD has recent combat experience
in Ukraine. This is an overlooked aspect when talking about the
effectiveness of armed forces. Size and equipment is not the only thing
that determines a unit's effectiveness. Recent tactical combat
experience can also increase lethality, something the GAAD now excels
in. **[Although speed and experience is great]{.underline}**, especially
in a hypothetical Baltic campaign, **[these air assault units simply do
not have the heavy weaponry, equipment, or logistics to maintain an
offensive posture against NATO combat units]{.underline}**. **[They are
outfitted for quick and rapid deployments rather than sustained fighting
with a superior force such as a U.S. Army Armored Brigade Combat Team.
To counter this, Russia would have to mobilize their armored and
mechanized forces, turning the conflict into an even bigger conventional
conflict]{.underline}**, **[something Putin knows would not fare well
against American/NATO airpower.]{.underline}**
