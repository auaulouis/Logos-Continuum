BDS means Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel -- it is a movement with
large support from Palestinians, western left intellectuals, marxists
and anti-colonialists and black radicals. This begins with a liberal
call for rights by demonizing the whole of Israel. AB strategy rests
upon criticizing the demand upon the nation state through non violence.
Cap strategy rests upon criticizing the demonization of all of Israel
instead of demonizing the ruling class.

### Philic Nationalism Link

#### The BDS campaign is a rallying cry for left leaning liberals who prey upon philia and recouperation of the nation state -- this results in inevitable capital colonial exploitation -- radical critique not tied upon the nation state is the only way to articulate a new world

**Sperber 16** (Joshua Sperber is a doctoral candidate in the political
science department at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate
Center. JOURNAL OF PALESTIAN STUDIES, VOL. 45 2015/16,

To return to the question posed above, why then do so many critics
abandon their conventional analytic frameworks for interpreting the
world when it comes to Israel? I argue that such interpretations result
from a convergence of two phenomena: the existence of generally
unquestioned yet problematic liberal-left ontologies and a widespread
erroneous perception of Israel's uniqueness. Broadly speaking, the Left
promotes concepts that are neither designed nor intended to advance its
interests. For instance, Judith [[Butler has
written]{.underline}]{.mark}, "[[The BDS movement has
become]{.underline}]{.mark} the most important contemporary alliance
[[calling for an end to forms of citizenship based on racial
stratification]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[insisting on rights
of]{.mark}]{.underline} political
[[self-determination]{.underline}]{.mark} for those for whom such basic
freedoms are denied or indefinitely suspended,
[[insisting]{.underline}]{.mark} as well [[on]{.underline}]{.mark}
substantial ways of [[redressing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[rights]{.underline}]{.mark} of those forcibly and/or illegally
dispossessed of property and land." \[33\] But [[one need only examine
the]{.underline}]{.mark} contemporary [[world to
doubt]{.underline}]{.mark} the merits of
[[citizenship]{.underline}]{.mark}.While [[it is undeniably oppressive
to be excluded from citizenship]{.underline}]{.mark} (the production of
a defining outside is part and parcel of citizenship's raison d'être),
[[Jewish Israeli citizens are subject to]{.underline}]{.mark} the same
domination, vulnerability, and [[exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark} that
nearly all members of modern states are. Not merely neoliberalism but
[[capitalism has maintained the existence of an exploited Jewish Israeli
working class that has to appease]{.underline}]{.mark} bosses [[at the
threat of hunger and]{.underline}]{.mark} landlords at the threat of
[[homelessness]{.underline}]{.mark}. \[34\] Proactively
[[demanding]{.underline}]{.mark} such a [[status for
all]{.underline}]{.mark} does little other [than [subordinate notions of
liberation to a]{.mark}]{.underline} fetishized [[regressive
egalitarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Further, the historically and
explicitly tractable nature of rights does not prevent Butler from
demanding that they be restored to Palestinians. But [[who
grants]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[rights]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
first place, and who has the power to restore them? [[And who retains
the power to suspend them again if they see fit]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
they are suspended now[[?]{.underline}]{.mark} Articulating a
historically grounded skepticism of rights, Giorgio Agamben has
suggested that: It is time to stop regarding declarations of rights as
proclamations of eternal, meta-juridical values binding the legislator
(in fact, without much success) to respect eternal ethical principles,
and to begin to consider them according to their real historical
function in the modern nation state. The same [[bare
life]{.underline}]{.mark} that in the ancien régime was politically
neutral and belonged to God as creaturely life . . . now fully enters
into the structure of the state and even [[becomes the earthly
foundation of the state's legitimacy and
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}. \[35\] While [[the
Left]{.underline}]{.mark} tends to invoke citizenship and rights as
defenses against institutional power, it by contrast generally
[[acclaims democracy as an unquestioned good]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
the Left's indignation concerning Israel arises from, as much as any
other factor, the fact that Israel, notwithstanding restricted Arab
representation in the Knesset, is not democratic. Israel, besides having
declared itself "a light unto nations," is one of the last liberal
states to grant formal rights to its predominantly European-descended
majority while denying these rights (from property and marriage rights
to the right of return) to its predominantly indigenous minorities
(namely, Arabs and other non-Jews) who constitute 25 percent of the
Israeli population proper. The resemblance between this de facto and de
jure legal, political, and social discrimination and nineteenth-century
European colonialism, as well as apartheid South Africa and the Jim Crow
South, encourages the anti-racist Left to view Israel as a particularly
hypocritical and offensive relic of an unacceptable and bygone era. [[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark} precisely [[this relationship between a ruling
group of predominantly white and biologically defined Jews and an
excluded group of mainly Muslim people of color that makes Israel
salient in the Left imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are numerous
reasons [[why there have not been prominent leftist protests of Saudi
Arabia or Chad]{.underline}]{.mark}, countries with horrendous social
divisions and oppression, but chief among them is that [[in these
countries the rulers by and large look]{.underline}]{.mark}---at least
[[to]{.mark}]{.underline} most [[observers in the Global North---like
the ruled]{.underline}]{.mark}. And it is in part the [[largely
unquestioned fealty to]{.underline}]{.mark} the concept and practice of
[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[prevents the Left from composing
a genuinely radical critique of the world, and a fortiori Israel, as it
exists today]{.underline}]{.mark}. That the desire for democracy is
ubiquitous should, but apparently does not, raise concern among leftists
whose protest chant of "This is what democracy looks like" comfortably
coexists with warmongering presidents' vows to bring democracy to the
Middle East. While leftists are enamored with the notion of the demos
ruling themselves, they spend less time examining the content and
purposes of this rule. Fixated on the who and the how rather than the
what and the why, leftists valorize mere proceduralism, a form without
content. The devastating, if not absurd, consequences of the Left's
fixation on democracy were recently on display in Greece, where the
left-wing coalition, Syriza, was seen as scoring a partial victory over
the European Union (EU) when the latter permitted the socialists to
self-manage the EU's austerity program, which of course does nothing to
challenge poverty as such and on the contrary ideologically reinforces
it as an unavoidable fact of life. And [[leftists]{.underline}]{.mark}
of course frequently [[compare Israel to South Africa and invoke
apartheid's demise as an inspiring model to
emulate]{.underline}]{.mark}. It need not defend racist South African
rule, however, to note that **[[South African poverty is as devastating
today as it has ever been, but because this poverty is administered by
putative representatives of the majority
population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[the Left, and the world as a whole,
take far less notice]{.underline}]{.mark}. That leftist supporters of
Palestinian nationalism invoke such models of self-administered poverty
as examples of radical politics indicates that the Left, beholden in
spite of itself to a form of identity politics, has in effect adopted
the economic and political interests of a Palestinian ruling class that
is eager to exploit Palestinian workers without external interference.
At best, such a stance reveals a fatal paucity of political imagination.
\* \* \* However, problematic liberal-left assumptions are ubiquitous
and therefore cannot of themselves explain the Left's idiosyncratic
treatment of Israel. This treatment results, I argue, from the
convergence of these liberal-left presuppositions with a prevailing
perception of Israeli nationalism itself, a perception that should be
distinguished from the prosaic material reality of the historical
development of Zionism and the Israeli nation-state. The modern project
of the nation-state fuses the two institutions that compose its name,
but while states, whether dynastic, monarchical, or papal, have existed
for millennia, the concept of the nation did not develop until the late
eighteenth century. And whereas the state is a territorial fact, the
nation is socially constructed, an "imagined community" that bases its
legitimacy and authority on an ancient "tradition" that paradoxically
could only have been "invented" under modernity. The inherently
contrived nature of the nation was perhaps best evinced by Massimo
d'Azeglio's well-known pronouncement following Italy's 1862 unification,
"We have made Italy. Now we must make Italians." Nevertheless,
throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, nationalism, defined
as real, became "real in its effects." Nationalism both produced and
articulated the collective self-identification and political aims of,
most prominently, independence movements that defined themselves in
opposition to the multinational Hapsburg, Ottoman, and Romanov empires
that collapsed following World War I and the European and Japanese
colonial empires that collapsed following World War II. Notwithstanding
the role of key economic factors, these national independence movements
evolved politically in part as reactions to rule by perceived
interlopers in particular geographic areas, whether in Serbia, Kenya,
Vietnam, or India. It is not difficult to view Zionism as being distinct
in this regard. A minority nearly everywhere but a majority nowhere,
Jewish nationalists did not fight for control of any of the lands where
they resided except for late Mandatory Palestine, where most Jews were
relative newcomers. Instead of constructing a national identity within
the context of a localized and concrete struggle with a dominant power
that they sought to win independence from, Zionism invoked a globally
diffused religious-ethnic-cum-national identity whose demand for a state
(whether in Argentina, Uganda, or ultimately Palestine) was initially
distinct from any single, ongoing, territorially specific struggle. That
is, instead of adopting nationalism as the language of its political
struggle, Zionism sought a specific and winnable political struggle that
would enable it to implement its nationalism. This was a nationalism
that, instead of defining itself against the Habsburgs, French, or
British, sought in this respect to define itself far more abstractly
against all. \[36\] Zionism in fact exploited this imagined abstractness
in order to mystify its ethnic cleansing of indigenous Palestinians whom
it universalized as "mere" Arabs. \[37\] Whereas the contemporary Left
indeed criticizes Zionism for having achieved its national independence
at the expense of the indigenous population, I am suggesting that it is
this notion of Zionism's abstractness that ironically helps account for
the perceived precariousness of Zionism's legitimacy outside of the
conservative biblical imagination. Such abstractness was only reinforced
by the explicit contingency accompanying Israel's creation. Israeli
statehood was dramatically established with the UN's 1947 vote, which
was influenced by sympathy from the "international community" (more
accurately, the Great Powers) for what remained of European Jews
following the Nazi genocide. The problem with such a "gift," however, is
that everyone knows that gifts can be withdrawn, a perception that to
some extent characterizes Israel as an anomalously tenuous member of the
"family of nations." There was a revealing presumptuousness in the Great
Powers' resolution of the Jewish Question at the expense of, not
European Christians who had historically persecuted Jews as such, but,
Muslim Arabs who had historically been far more tolerant of Jews whom
they either treated as one minority among others or respected as a
fellow "People of the Book." As Israel's abuse of Palestinians has
become more visible and abhorrent, it is difficult for its critics not
to wonder whether Israel is forfeiting the goodwill that enabled it to
become a state in the first place. To be sure, the Zionist lesson of the
Judeocide at first glance appears convincing, although not in the manner
in which the defenders of a Jewish state imagine. If there is a common
denominator in the Nazis' conceptions and persecution of Jews it is that
of nationless-ness. The Nazis conceived of Jews as, in the
pseudo-scientific language of the day, an unassimilable "virus" that
attacks not merely the "host" but the "host's" very "immune system."
\[38\] More specifically, Nazi ideology conceived of the Jews as less of
an "actual" race than an "anti-race" existing outside of the Nazis'
carefully constructed racial hierarchy. \[39\] Simultaneously, the Nazis
feared Jews as the personification of Judeo-Bolshevism, a historical
force that was understood as an existential threat to Germany's borders,
national identity, social relations, and statehood. The common
characteristic uniting these seemingly disparate categorizations is that
they both define the Jew as intrinsically international or, more
precisely, nationless. I argue that it is only through examining the
Nazis' dread of nationless-ness that we can reconcile the apparent
contradiction in the Nazis' description of the Jew as both international
communist and global capitalist. Similarly, it is only through the idea
of nationless-ness that we can adequately account for the Nazis'
ferocious persecution of their second-most hated enemy: the Gypsies, of
whom half a million were murdered. And Nazism, lest we forget,
represented nationalism par excellence. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark}
then mindless if not [[cruel to conclude]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} appropriate [[response to the Nazis' genocide
is the creation of]{.underline}]{.mark} yet [[another state rather than
the radical criticism of nationalism and the system of nation-states
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the creation of Israel has not only led
to the oppression of non-Jews but has also failed to protect the
security of its Jewish citizens; Netanyahu's exhortations to European
Jews to immigrate to their supposed haven are belied by his perpetual
warnings of an impending Iranian nuclear attack. Moreover, it is not
only [[Jews]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[have been destroyed by
nation-constructing]{.underline}]{.mark} or empire-building states but
[[also]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Native Americans and
Armenians]{.underline}]{.mark} in addition to a great [[many
others]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this regard, the "lesson of the
Holocaust" is more relevant to the terrible vulnerability of the
stateless and putatively unassimilable Palestinians than it is to
Israel, which in the final analysis is defined less by any supposed
Jewish essence than by the economic and political demands that confront
all states. As Nicholas De Genova has asserted, "The heritage of the
Holocaust belongs to the Palestinian people. The State of Israel has no
claim to the heritage of the Holocaust. The heritage of the oppressed
belongs to the oppressed, not the oppressor." \[40\] But if it is
unreasonable to suggest that the solution to Jewish suffering is a
Jewish state, [[it is just as unreasonable to suggest that the solution
to Palestinian suffering is a Palestinian state]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Expressing a weariness of the notion that the only alternative to being
a victim is to become a persecutor, Jean Genet has asserted, "[[The day
when the Palestinians become institutionalized . . . I will no longer be
at their side]{.underline}]{.mark}. The day the Palestinians become a
nation like the other nations, I will no longer be there." \[41\] [[Such
a stance hardly entails inaction]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the contrary,
it expresses an understanding **[that [human liberation will result not
from joining the very institutions that are responsible for mass
suffering but from criticizing their fundamental purposes and, through
this criticism, articulating a world worth fighting
for]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Link -- Non violence/Black Silence

#### The 1ac replicated the call found at so many liberally minded universities for BDS to challenge the settler colonialist state of Israel through non-violent means -- their failure to locate anti-blackness at the center of their analytical understanding undermines true radical resistance within Palestine and fuels global anti-blackness -- we cannot unquestionably endorse the BDS -- we can only unquestionably criticize anti-blackness

The black is off the map, and it is from this void that I encounter the
discourse around the recent passing of a resolution by the American
Studies Association in support of the international boycott, divestment,
and sanctions ([[BDS) movement]{.underline}]{.mark} against the Israeli
occupation of Palestine. In spite of good intentions it must be said
frankly that the ASA [[resolution arises from an anti-black calculus
that must be called out and dealt with]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Anti-blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} may seem like a secondary concern,
a voided subject to avoid, but for the duration of this piece [[the
shadow of this conversation around Israel will get center
stage]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[the shadow]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
void [[will speak back]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[it is imperative to
listen]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the debate that has emerged around the
resolution, there is a deafening silence, one that screams at me every
time I read an article either for or against the resolution. [[The
resolution is the]{.underline}]{.mark} result of ASA voting to, in some
measure, meet the [[call]{.underline}]{.mark} of Palestinian civil
society [[to employ]{.underline}]{.mark} forms "[[nonviolent punitive
means" to get Israel to end its human rights
violations]{.underline}]{.mark} against the Palestinian people. The
boycott of Israel has been discussed in ASA since at least 2006. From
then on there have been deliberative and systematic steps to understand
all the relevant issues on the table, including panels and meetings
specifically geared towards this subject. After a discussion involving
more than 700 members that allowed 44 people to speak at this year's ASA
meeting, the ASA overwhelmingly voted to support this resolution to
support the Palestinian BDS movement (to see the entire resolution,
click here). In spite of its general criticism of Israel's human rights
violation[[, the absence that screams louder than this progressive
stance is the utter lack of any mention of Israel's history of
anti-black policies and violent aggression against African
immigrants]{.underline}]{.mark}. Considering the context of the
resolution, the absence of Israel's anti-black policies and mob-violence
is not peculiar --- it was to be expected. And yet [[what is to be
expected should not be accepted]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially from an
organization acting in the stated interest of "justice." Its silence
occurs in an especially unethical time. Within the last few months,
Israel's anti-black immigration policies and the recent mob-led riot
against African immigrants have exploded into international news (with
headlines such as "Violent Anti-African Race Riot Rocks Israel, Black
Men and Women Beaten" or "Israel Passes Law aimed at deterring African
Migrants"). [[The ASA resolution]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore does
double damage: it [[simultaneously ignores the importance of
anti-blackness to the Israel's colonial regime and]{.underline}]{.mark}
actually **[[acts to cover it up by moving critical academic attention
away from the current anti-black crisis towards the well-defined
contours of an Israel-Palestine debate that]{.mark} [always circles
around anti-semitism versus settler colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[What falls out is how anti-blackness exists as its own singular
formation of violence that operates in excess of --- and simultaneously
in concert with --- the logic of racism or settler
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}. The response to this may be that even
if the plight of African immigrants is dire, to bring it up in the
context of the Israel/Palestine conflict is at best in poor taste and at
worst a vulgar form of opportunism. This response is inadequate for a
multitude of reasons. First, [[there is a growing movement
of]{.mark}]{.underline} Palestinian [[activists]{.underline}]{.mark}
(and activists for the Palestinian cause) [[who recognize the centrality
of anti-blackness to understanding the Israeli colonial regime and also
desire to move towards a greater solidarity with blackness through
calling out the anti-black violence endemic to their own
culture]{.underline}]{.mark} (notable example, "Confronting Anti-Black
Racism in the Arab World"). Second, connected to the last point, is that
**[[the reluctance to deal with Israeli anti-blackness is emblematic of
the larger inability for black suffering in the Middle East and North
Africa to become a discernible international
scandal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Black suffering exists as a consistent
heartbeat of the region, as its repressed absent center through which
the other conflicts take place on top of from the sixth century onward.
**[[What remains unthought and unmentioned]{.mark}]{.underline}** in all
of these moves towards solidarity is that in spite of all their
differences, both **[[Israel and Palestine (and much of the Arab world)
mutually bond over anti-black violence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[In
order to deal with anti-blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} in this region,
[[one would have complicate]{.underline}]{.mark} all terms of
[[solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark} and reveal the nuanced networks of
violence that hold the conflict together. In other words,
[[anti-blackness becomes a subject that could implode the entire
conversation and reveal]{.underline}]{.mark} an eery, yet essential
consensus between the warring factions who fight in solidarity with
[[Israel or Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[neither wants to
centralize and deal with anti-blackness in the
region.]{.underline}]{.mark} Third, if we can agree it is politically
and ethically vacuous to ignore the connection between Israeli
anti-blackness and its colonial relationship to Palestine, then what is
the reason to not, at least, mention it in the list of offenses of the
resolution? Is it because of the threat that blackness will take over
the conversation and distract from the true issue[[? If we are
boycotting Israel for their human rights violations, it would seem their
consistent violations of the human rights of Black people should be a
part of the "true issue" at least]{.underline}]{.mark}. More to the
point, the continued plight of black people wherever they are in the
globe is reflective of the fact that we need a radical overhaul of our
ideas of the "true issue" --- it shows we need a better understanding of
the paradigm that drives the relation between disparate forms of
violence in different regions in the world. Let us make no mistake here,
this is not an issue of ignorance or miseducation. The American Studies
Association is filled with nothing but experts on the history of this
region, people who could run laps around me in terms of understanding
the socio-historical facts or the on-the-ground situation. Knowledge of
both are essential, and yet having the knowledge and pursuing the
question into its troubling conclusion --- straight into the void --- do
not necessarily follow one after the other. One could know nothing but
the simple fact that no matter where in the globe we are, there will be
black people being treated like shit and take up this question. Or one
could know every fact about the area and still not even gesture toward a
mention of the black suffering occuring on the ground --- the latter is
what happened with the ASA resolution. [[Any reason for **not
mentioning** Israeli anti-black violence is inadequate and represents a
problem much **bigger than ignorance**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it is a
question of political and ethical proportions.]{.underline}]{.mark}

A new boycott campaign has been gaining an echo within the Palestinian
solidarity movement. This campaign is known as "Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions", BDS for short. Sometimes it is referred to as the campaign
against Israeli Apartheid. We truly believe that the supporters of this
campaign are acting from a genuine desire to end the suffering of the
Palestinian people. However, we have to frankly say that we do not
believe that the methods of this campaign can defeat Israeli
imperialism. What is notable about this campaign is that it ignores the
question of class in both Israel and Palestine. We believe that only a
working class approach can put an end to Israeli imperialism.

What is BDS and who supports it?

The campaign for [[B]{.underline}]{.mark}oycott,
[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}ivestment and [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}anctions
[[was launched]{.underline}]{.mark} on 9th July, 2005
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} a \"unified call\" drawing together more than
one hundred Palestinian organizations. Amongst these are the Ramallah
[[Chamber of Commerce]{.underline}]{.mark}, some PLO popular committees,
the Palestinian General Federation of Trade
[[Unions]{.underline}]{.mark}, the General Union of Palestinian
Teachers, the Federation of Unions of Palestinian University Professors
and Employees, the Palestinian Engineers' Association, the Palestinian
Lawyers\' Association, [[and an alphabet soup of NGOs and \"civil
society\" groups]{.underline}]{.mark} in the occupied territories and
Israel itself.

[[These groups have elected a \"Boycott National
Committee]{.underline}]{.mark}\", which has been entrusted to lead the
campaign as well as manage the official website, BDSmovement.net.

The campaign has been able to gain the support of some trade unions in
Canada, such as the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and the Fédération
Autonome du Collégial teachers\' union in Quebec. It also has an
extensive list of supporters worldwide.

[[Its demands on the Israeli state are laid out in the original
call]{.underline}]{.mark}:

\"1. [[End]{.underline}]{.mark}ing its [[occupation]{.underline}]{.mark}
and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall;

2\. [[Recognizing]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[fundamental rights
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to

institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one
racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with
the intention of maintaining that regime". The concept of apartheid
became central to the BDS movement's framing of the conflict. Whereas
the Palestinian Authority sought to accentuate its autonomy and
state-like characteristics, the BDS movement underlined the PA's
subservience to Israel. For proponents of the two-state model, the PA
was a nationalist project working toward eventual independence, while in
the apartheid framework it was merely an Israeli satrap. BDS leaders
emphasised the de facto "one-state reality" of Israel-Palestine -- which
had become a common trope even among Israel's supporters, many of whom
were dismayed at the possibility that the country could eventually be
forced to enfranchise the Palestinians living under occupation and
thereby cease to be a Jewish state. Increasingly among both Israel's
centre-left friends and its enemies, the idea of a single state was not
a plan for the future -- to be sought or averted -- but an accurate
description of the reality on the ground, which was becoming more and
more difficult to disentangle. [Jews were already a
minority](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/army-presents-figures-showing-arab-majority-in-israel-territories-1.5940676)
in the territory under the control of Israel, which regulated the
Palestinians' borders, exports and imports, customs revenues and permits
for travel and work. Legally, commercially and administratively, the
Jewish and Palestinian populations were interlaced.

### Academic Freedom Link

#### The affirmatives embracement of the possibility of academic freedom is exactly at odds with academic fugitivity -- the correct framing of BDS would reject freedom in place of an opportunity to criticize sources of power

**Moten 16** (Fred Moten's Statement in Support of a Boycott of Israeli
Academic Institutions,
<https://mlaboycott.wordpress.com/2016/09/07/fred-motens-statement-in-support-of-a-boycott-of-israeli-academic-institutions/>,
accessed 3/19/19, jmg)

But this raises the question of whether or not Israeli academic
freedom---or, for that matter, any state-sanctioned, state-protected
academic freedom but also [[the very idea of academic
freedom]{.underline}]{.mark} insofar as it [[must be state-sanctioned
and state-protected if it is to exist]{.underline}]{.mark}---should be
subject to constraint. What if [[academic freedom is
defined]{.underline}]{.mark} precisely [[by the fact that
it]{.underline}]{.mark} is a thing that [[can be enjoyed by peoples such
as the Israelis and not by peoples such as the
Palestinians?]{.underline}]{.mark} What is academic freedom that it can
be exercised by Israelis and not by Palestinians and why would
Palestinians, and those in solidarity with them, want it? Corollary, but
absolutely subordinate, to that question is the question concerning the
cost of academic freedom that Israelis are asked to pay. Like the evil
song says, [[freedom isn't free]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[What does
academic freedom cost those who are said to enjoy
it?]{.underline}]{.mark} This is a question that is, again, corollary
and secondary to the question concerning the cost of academic freedom
that is meted out upon the ones whose oppression brings it into
existence and relief. This problematic of cost is, of course,
inseparable from a set of questions concerning benefit. [[We assume the
benefits that accrue to academic freedom without considering the
benefits that accrue to intellectual fugitivity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Academic freedom is a matter of state]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It's
unclear what business it is of those of us who are, and/or may choose to
be, stateless]{.underline}]{.mark}. Perhaps we should be moving and
thinking against state-sanctioned, terror-defined academic freedom,
intellectual normativity's oxymoronic mode of being, which is only
instantiated by way of exclusion and honored always and only in its
non-observance, which (neo-)liberal defenders of it administer
constantly through any number of vicious and brutal forms of evaluative
regulation. Consider the profound structures of unfreedom within which
students everywhere, and of every age, must operate. [[Academic freedom
is the condition under which the intellectual
submits]{.underline}]{.mark} [[herself to the normative model of the
settler]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Academic freedom is a form of violence
perpetrated by academic bosses who operate under the protection and in
the interest of racial state capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark} Recognize
that as a form of violence it is *reactive and reactionary* in its
brutality. It responds to the anoriginary counter-violence of thought
and of imagination. It seeks to regulate thought's capacity and
imperative to (over)turn. It is left to us not only *not* to assert a
right to this irreducible violence of thought and *poesis* but also, and
rather, *to* assert that its existence is before rights, before the
state that constructs and guarantees rights by way of a range of
modalities of exclusion that can only be ours to refuse. This is all to
say that [[the call to solidarity that the movement for BDS has been
trying to answer]{.underline}]{.mark} [[gives]{.mark}]{.underline} MLA
members---and indeed all American
intellectuals---[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}nother unmatched and unmatchable
[[gift]{.underline}]{.mark} which allows and requires us [[to think
about how to live and what to do]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Solidarity Link/Alt

#### Solidarity is not a yes no question -- orientation has to come first -- then appropriate solidarity builds -- their refusal to center anti-blackness creates the worse forms of solidarity -- an alternative which relishes in blackness is the only possibility for a world beyond

[[The question]{.underline}]{.mark} being [[raised from the void of
blackness is not]{.underline}]{.mark} one of either saying [["yes" or
"no" to solidarity, but instead explodes the bounds through which
choices issue from]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is not a question for how to
be with or against Israel, but instead demands we rethink how we can
form solidarity in an infinitely more complex and violent situation. And
no, it is not an adequate answer to say Frantz Fanon or Malcolm X or any
other figure believed in a natural solidarity between Arabs and Blacks.
They had their ways of answering this question, and yet the [[question
still remains]{.underline}]{.mark} to be posed [[because of the
perpetuation of the African slave trade in the region, the anti-black
solidarity between Israel and the Arab nations, the black flesh that is
beaten, burned, murdered]{.underline}]{.mark}. No, there is no easy
answer to this question --- it is a question that demands to be handled
as the singularity it is[[. Shout outs to different activists working on
the frontlines of the Palestinian struggle that recognize the centrality
and singularity of anti-blackness in this entire
affair.]{.underline}]{.mark} It is by meeting ya'll that this question
that I have always felt, from the days I cut my teeth as a young teenage
activist on the question of Palestine, but did not know how to pose has
percolated further in my mind now. The ASA resolution emerges directly
out of an obfuscation of this work that is currently happening between
certain activists on both sides. [[If solidarity is
important]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [[all cards must be laid on the
table at all times]{.underline}]{.mark}, never swept under the rug
strategically to make things easier. [[This is not about
intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [[instead is a question of paradigm
and what concepts **center one's analysis**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
ASA resolution's [[silence speaks louder than]{.underline}]{.mark} any
individual's [[intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The statement reflects
an organization that looked into the abyss of black suffering and patted
it on the head saying, "Its not your time. Maybe it was before, and
maybe it will be later. But it will not be now." We already know that
[[the question of blackness can never arrive on
time]{.underline}]{.mark}, its question is always posed too late to be
considered or too early to be anything other than a nuisance. Contrary
to the feeling of some, [[there has never been a black
time]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[only an anti-black world where black people
exist as its absent center, always too loud, needing to be silenced, yet
always remaining unthought and hyper-present]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is
for this reason that I cannot remain silent, the question that has been
posed before must be re-posed incessantly, interminably, endlessly. It
may never be a good time, but that is exactly why the time to pose the
fundamental question of black suffering is right now. The time is now
for ASA to answer for its omission. [[The time is now for all of us to
answer to the centrality and singularity of black suffering, against the
academic mode of analogization]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The time is now
to take up a new rubric for understanding anti-blackness, one that
exceeds an anti-racist, marxist, feminist, or decolonial
framework]{.underline}]{.mark}. No matter the context, the political
issue, or social movement the question must be posed [[in order to force
open a world where Black Lives can actually matter. It is the
unflinching articulation of the unthought question stated loud, proud,
and enraged that can obliterate the anti-black world]{.mark} ---
anti-blackness understood as something shared between reactionary and
radical forces --- and institute a new world, [a Blackened world, a
Black Era]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The interconnections between [[Black and Palestinian
struggles]{.underline}]{.mark} have been well established. Consider the
[[framing]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[asserts these are "similar

African American and Palestinian experiences with [similar
forms](http://www.ebony.com/news-views/why-black-people-must-stand-with-palestine-402#axzz3bHlxfPzM) of
systematic state violence, military occupation, and mass incarceration

[[asserting]{.underline}]{.mark} either "similarity" or a "[[shared
enemy]{.underline}]{.mark}" ([[capitalism, imperialism,
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}, etc[[.) cannot sustain long-term
Black-Palestinian solidarity and has]{.underline}]{.mark} (intentionally
or unintentionally) [[produced "transactional" forms of
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a U.S. context where simply
asserting a Palestinian narrative (of dispossession, struggle, etc.) is
a battle of its own[[, the transaction model establishes "solidarity" in
exchange for legitimacy or visibility]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[many
Palestine solidarity activists have struggled with and against the
opportunistic short term move of reaching out to Black liberation
movements in ways that do not do much more than legitimizing our
struggle or broadening our base]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**\**
We can turn to long-standing examples where "joint struggle" work
extends beyond the "already converted" solidarity activists. Consider
the relationships between Palestinian, Black, and Latino communities
established between 1991 and 2012 in Chicago through the SWYC. SWYC had
three after school youth centers and a Community Organizing Initiative.
Their vision, work, and structure had communities working together
across cultural/racial/ethnic boundaries and they were intentional about
centering the different surrounding local communities. Day to day
connections brought about an organic coalitional consciousness whereby
those involved understood and addressed the many connected forms of
racism, solidarity with Palestinians, etc. Recently, members of Greater
Detroit's Z Collective have been discussing a plan for hosting private
women\'s circles to talk within Arab American communities not only about
issues impacting "Arabs," but also about the connected issues of
anti-Black racism in light of the hierarchical and fraught context of
Arab-Black relations in Greater Detroit. \
\
Yet many collaborative initiatives lack a long-term agenda; have failed
to bring to life "joint struggle" on the ground; and have been short
lived. Since we do not exist outside racial capitalism, this painful and
exhausting work requires (for Arab Americans) challenging anti-Black
racism in our own communities \--in the intimate spaces of our
neighborhoods and living rooms and standing up when inter-racial
marriages are banned or when racial tensions become inflamed. We need to
show up for each other when *any* of us are colonized, sexually
assaulted, intimidated, brutalized, or killed. And as recipients of the
racist-imperialist corporate media and education system, Black and Arab
communities generally need to do something about the limited knowledge
and misinformation many of us carry about each other's histories,
traditions, and politics. The "big events" and the "photo ops" are
important, but while we are organizing the next rally, let's also focus
on long-term joint campaigns and analyses and let us build life-long
relationships.

### Empathy Bad

Anti-blackness is the tacit or explicit use of Blackness to mark what is
undesirable, disposable, and not valued on a sliding scale of humanness,
and it includes all of the pleasures and subtle benefits of that marking
for those who do it. The impulse to deny anti-Blackness as a lived
encounter and socially legitimized practice gives some clue about its
acceptance and the work that goes into protecting it. Anti-blackness
emerges from a robust set of interlocking legacy institutions that
legitimize segregation and black invisibility, weaponized visibility,
and ultimately black death to secure and prioritize white supremacy,
renamed as a drive for 'safety'. Rather than focus on a crisis of
empathy for black death, anti-Blackness probes our political imagination
to historicize the ways black disappearance, torture, devaluation, and
the racialized optics of terror congeal into inevitability. As a result
anti-Blackness reframes the question of how we die. Instead of viewing
black death as a demographic issue that affects a particular population,
it signals the importance of blackness as a predicate that releases
those who kill black people from responsibility. The challenge
organizers face in addressing spectacularly racialized state violence
and vigilantism, is to resist the urge to metaphorize slain black bodies
as the master sign of disposability. We can then think of anti-blackness
as a way of naming the operating assumption that Black people can be
killed with impunity and instead of reinforcing that as an enduring
fact, offer a broader prompt to reimagine our political futures beyond
an exclusive claim to humanness premised on the disappearance or
marginalization of blackness.

**\**
Theorizations of anti-blackness produce a critique of identity politics
and multiracial coalitions, as [[any]{.underline}]{.mark} [[politics of
recognition ultimately claims inclusion in civil society and humanity,
masking complicity with structures of
anti-blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} (see for example Sexton 2010,
Wilderson 2010). Similarly, settler colonialism is a permanent structure
of native elimination (e.g. Wolfe 2006), but the ontological position of
the Native articulates with that of the Slave only when s/he claims
genocide. When the Native does not claim a radical politics of refusal,
but rather, some form of liberal inclusion, s/he too capitulates to the
structure of white supremacy. [[Anti-blackness is formative of the
Israeli settler colonial state]{.underline}]{.mark} and consequently[[,
the structural position of the Palestinian native is shaped by
anti-black animus]{.underline}]{.mark}. The settler colonial regime's
inscription of terror against the Palestinian native's body and home
space has been the precondition for the life and 'safety' of the Jewish
settler polity since the Nakba. It is thus that Palestinian suffering
and death, in both its "exceptional" and mundane forms, must not be seen
as an aberration to, but rather formative of the settler colonial state.
If we take this analysis to its logical conclusion, [[understanding that
there is no integration for the Palestinian native into the Israeli
settler state]{.underline}]{.mark} (to do so, she would have to cease
being Palestinian), [[calls for a political project that goes **beyond
any state solution**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[towards]{.mark}]{.underline} a project of [[settler
decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Engaging the logic of
anti-blackness forces]{.mark} us to reckon with [a decolonization
project that is not reducible to]{.mark} some [form of native
sovereignty wedded to the nation-state]{.mark} form]{.underline},
[[but]{.mark} one that [seeks a far more radical break with Western
epistemology]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and the construction of a new
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Anything less is merely a deferred form
of genocide for native Palestinians, and complicity with the structure

### Link - Settler Colonialism Link

#### Foregrounding settler colonialism fuels violent Zionist reactions -- stops a class based struggle that ends colonial and capitalist violence

**SSM 16** (Socialist Struggle Movement (CWI Israel-Palestine) The
necessity of a class approach and a socialist alternative,
<https://www.socialistalternative.org/2016/04/30/israelpalestine-marxist-left-national-conflict-palestinian-struggle/>,

The approaches of sections of the international [[left who adopt a
narrow national approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to the problem and propose
to [[ignore the fears of millions of Israeli Jews]{.underline}]{.mark}
and their will for national self-determination, [[do not represent any
serious road for a solution]{.underline}]{.mark}. The catastrophic
process of occupation, expropriation and oppression of the Palestinians
by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel does not negate the fact
that masses of Jewish refugees from European countries and from Arab and
Muslim countries were cynically exploited by the world powers and by the
nationalist Zionist elite. [[The simplistic nationalist reference to all
Israeli Jews as 'settlers' ignores]{.underline}]{.mark} among other
things the fact that [[the majority]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [[are
country-born, without any affinity to another
country]{.underline}]{.mark}. Considering the history of the Holocaust,
the persecution of Jews and the anti-Semitic threats of reactionary Arab
and Islamist forces in the Middle East, a programme that would propose
that millions of Israelis simply give up national independence will be
perceived as an 'annihilation' plan**[[. It will push the Israeli
working class more strongly into the hands of the Israeli right-wing and
for a 'survival war' by any means, including nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More than this, even in a hypothetical
bloody scenario in which an external force subdues Israel militarily,
then millions of Israelis Jews would become an oppressed national
minority and the national conflict would continue in a terrible new
form. True, [[the Zionist movement]{.underline}]{.mark} and the State of
Israel have implemented and [[implement]{.mark}]{.underline} until this
day a [[colonialist policy]{.underline}]{.mark} striving for the pushing
aside and expropriation of the Arab-Palestinian population in favour of
the Israeli-Jewish population. This policy includes not only the history
of uprooting the Palestinian population and the settlements enterprise
today in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but also organised plans of
the state for the 'Judaization' of territories within the Green Line,
particularly in the Negev and Galilee. The [[Israeli ruling class sees
the expropriated Palestinian masses as an existential threat for the
future of its rule]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Israeli capitalist regime,
which is still in a conflict with the Palestinian population and with
the Arab and Muslim populations in the region, strives to base its
existence on mobilising support from the Jewish population in Israel and
through collaborations with the imperialist policy of the capitalist
powers, especially the US, as well as with autocratic regimes which are
willing to do business with it. Not by accident it supported and even
was mobilized for imperialist wars in the region; assisted the Jordanian
monarchy to crush the 1970 Black September uprising; was one of the last
partners the Apartheid regime in South Africa maintained; has assisted
for decades the armament and military training of dictatorships around
the world, including the former military dictatorship in Chile and the
militias which committed the genocide in Rwanda; and symbolically it
offered the Egyptian autocrat Mubarak political asylum. Against this
background, [[there are currents]{.underline}]{.mark} in the left
[[opposing the 'right of existence' of Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of
course the Marxist left opposes all regimes of oppression in the region
and globally. But on this basis one could allegedly oppose also the
'right of existence' of the United States, Germany, Britain or France,
which as major imperialist powers have caused the greatest horrors in
history. There are those who claim that specifically the right of
existence of Israel should be opposed [[because it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} a nation state 'made up' and
[[established]{.mark} [under]{.mark}]{.underline} the sponsorship of the
[[capitalist powers]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to serve their
imperialist policy in the Middle East, and because it's been established
through the expropriation of the Palestinian masses. However, generally,
the national borders in the Middle East, which the civil wars in Iraq
and Syria undermine now, were dictated to a large extent by the
imperialist powers, through the Sykes-Picot agreement signed secretly a
hundred years ago and a series of following imperialist agreements. The
claim in regards to national states which the imperialist powers created
de facto or nurtured for their benefit can serve also against the right
of existence of a series of other states in the world, including in the
former USSR territories, the Balkans, the Baltic area, Pakistan or
Taiwan, for example. Aside from that, although the process of
establishment of the State of Israel had unique features and although
the Marxist left had warned about the expected destructive repercussions
of the Partition Plan and opposed it, it should be taken into account
that a long list of national states were created in a tragic manner as a
result of occupations, mass uprooting of populations, colonial
expropriation and nationalist policy striving to change the demographic
composition in favour of the ruling national-ethnic group. However,
[[the important question]{.underline}]{.mark}, also in relation to the
US for example, is [[how]{.underline}]{.mark} it's possible
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark} from a reality
of oppression and robbery [[to a solution to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
fundamental problems and for the [[establish]{.underline}]{.mark}ment of
[[a new]{.underline}]{.mark}, democratic and equal
[[society]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The Marxist left]{.underline}]{.mark}
cannot suffice in pointing to the reactionary character of regimes and
their bloody history -- it [[needs to show how capitalist and
imperialist nations are based on contradictions, how they could split on
a class basis and how it would be possible to get over the
calamities]{.underline}]{.mark} of the capitalist and imperialist era in
that way. Thus the State of Israel as well is not only a
settler/colonial state, ruled by one nationality and expropriating
another -- it is also a capitalist state of class exploitation and
oppression in a crisis-ridden class society. Parts of the international
[[left tend to adopt a nationalist attitude to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
millions of Israeli [[Jews, as one block]{.underline}]{.mark} of
reaction, [[a society of settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which the
fundamental contradiction is allegedly not a class one but a national
one, and in which the masses have no real interest in ending the
oppression of the Palestinians, in social liberation or in socialist
change. [This]{.underline} is a [crude abstraction]{.underline}, to say
the least, of the concrete reality. As such it [is]{.underline} actually
blurring, and not sharpening, the picture of the forces of reaction in

masses for the crimes of "their" ruling classes and regimes. [[Such an
approach reduces]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, [[the responsibility of
generals, tycoons and nationalist parties for the horrors they help
create]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[befogs the

Palestinian families within the Green Line, [[and millions of exploited
and]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively [[impoverished workers who suffer
from Israeli capitalism and from the ongoing national
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is an approach which depicts Israeli
society in a non-dialectical fashion and almost as one without internal
contradiction. Although the national antagonism is usually the most
prominent one and restraining the development of the class struggle on
the side of the workers, [[the class antagonism is nevertheless the
fundamental internal contradiction which undermines 'national unity' and
represents the potential for getting beyond Israeli capitalist society
and building a new society]{.underline}]{.mark}. Objectively, and
regardless of the moods and reactionary perceptions which are widespread
at the current stage, the Israeli working class has a key role to fulfil
in the struggle against Israeli capitalism and for the socialist change
of society.

The real question is: \"[[is this the method that can overthrow Israeli
imperialism?]{.underline}]{.mark}\" The answer from the [[BDS
activists]{.underline}]{.mark} [[always returns to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the experience of [[South Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. How was South
African Apartheid Really Overthrown? In the Western media and academia,
there is a myth that the sanctions against South Africa were the weapon
that brought down the apartheid regime. Nothing could be further from
the truth. [[Sanctions]{.mark} [played]{.mark}]{.underline} a relatively
[[little role in undermining the white regime]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[which merely passed on the privations to the black working
class]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It was not pressure from above, but fear
of revolution from below, that led the South African ruling class to
adopt "democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}". Faced with horrendous
exploitation and oppression the [[black workers developed powerful mass
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Congress of South African Trade
Unions ([[COSATU), and the South African Communist
Party,]{.mark}]{.underline} in alliance with the African National
Congress, all stood for the eradication of capitalism and the
institution of a socialist society. Together these mass organizations
encompassed millions of workers. COSATU [[launched onto the road of
strikes and class struggle and played a decisive role in uniting the
working class.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The strategists of capital came to
the conclusion that if there was not reform from above, there would be
revolution from below]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They did a deal with
Mandela]{.underline}]{.mark} and the ANC leadership to end "white rule"
in government as long as the capitalists continued to rule the economy.
[[South African apartheid was overthrown by the mass struggle of the
black working class]{.underline}]{.mark}, who produced all of the
products of South African society, and therefore held enormous power in
their hands once united. [[It was this threat of socialist revolution
from below that forced the granting of concessions from
above]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it should not be forgotten either that
[[it was a bittersweet victory]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The masses could
have easily overthrown capitalism and taken power; instead they continue
to live the same misery as before, but with a black
president.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the new South Africa, the gap between
the black working class and the bourgeoisie has become even wider than
it ever was under apartheid. The only difference now is that the ANC
leaders who betrayed the workers' real aspirations of a decisive change
and carried out this abortion have been rewarded handsomely for their
services. They have all raised themselves above the masses. A layer of
black bourgeoisie has arisen, and black bosses sit on the boards of
directors of major corporations. For them, life is spectacular. For the
black masses, nothing has changed. [[Apartheid enforced by law and
repression has been replaced by economic apartheid and we are seeing a
new wave of class struggle in South Africa today.]{.mark} [This
underlines the need for a working class solution. Without it, and within
the confines of capitalism, there is no way
forward]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Intifada and Palestinian self-defence [[The Palestinian movement has
gone through the entire spectrum of tactics---from guerrilla war,
to]{.mark}]{.underline} plane hijackings, kidnappings, [[terrorism,
bourgeois compromises, and now, boycott]{.underline}]{.mark}. Throughout
the past decades, [[while the Palestinian
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}
already [[moving towards]{.underline}]{.mark} some kind of
[[deal]{.underline}]{.mark} with the state of Israel, [[something was
developing beneath the surface in Palestinian
society]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first Intifada burst forth in 1987.
[[The revolution did not wait for]{.underline}]{.mark} the Palestinian
[[leaders; it came despite their failures]{.underline}]{.mark}, and did
its work without them. The Palestinian masses threw up councils of
revolutionary action to organize their struggle throughout the occupied
territories, and even in Palestinian-Israeli neighbourhoods.
Spontaneously, and with a leadership thrown up on the ground within the
neighbourhoods and with sheer determination and spirit drove the
movement forward. The councils mushroomed, the expression of the
collective activity of downtrodden masses flooding onto the stage of
history for the very first time. In contrast to the corrupt methods and
stale tactics of the isolated groups that had, until then, dominated
political activity, the movement was truly democratic and put forward
concrete demands. Some [[councils organized mass boycotts of Israeli
taxes, which were collected by the army]{.underline}]{.mark}. General
strikes arose and barricades were constructed. [[This was a political
earthquake]{.underline}]{.mark}, and achieved what all the tactics of
the established Palestinian leaders could not achieve in decades: [[fear
gripped the Israeli ruling class]{.underline}]{.mark}. The repression
and intensified house demolitions were only spurring the movement on.
The exploited Israeli working class watched its sons sent to the front
lines to kill fearless stone-throwing children; the capitalists
rightfully feared the effect this would have on their consciousness. The
Israeli capitalists' worst fears were that Israeli workers would make
the connection between cuts to their wages and services, and to the
attacks on the Palestinian masses. [[A general strike in Israel, in
solidarity with the Palestinian masses and their popular insurrection,
would have spelled the beginning of the end of Israeli
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the Israeli workers' leaders
were tied to the Israeli bosses and worked with them to sell out the
struggles of the workers. They did everything possible to support the
Israeli regime in its hour of need. US imperialism led the efforts to
negotiate a compromise that could offer a more secure order in the
territories. The Israeli imperialists found willing servants in the
nascent Palestinian bourgeoisie. In effect, a privileged Palestinian
elite was given the task of policing the Palestinian masses, and
profited from the occupation. Palestinians worked for Israeli companies,
crossing into Israel and returning home at night, but also worked for
other Palestinians who built bottling plants and booming capitalist
operations. [[The Palestinian petty-bourgeois leadership developed into
a bourgeoisie and got comfortable and corrupt]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Fatah evolved from an organization that at least talked of socialism and
revolution into the party of the capitalists and super rich in the
occupied territories. [[The BDS campaign claims a rejection of violence,
**but that is not the point**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[self-defence
of the Palestinian people is justified and
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}; if anything[[, the Intifada taught the
neighbourhood councils that they needed arms to defend the revolution,
prevent the massacres, and inflict defeats on the Israeli army when it
enters Palestinian territory. But]{.underline}]{.mark} this revolution
[[had nothing in common with the tactics of suicide attacks, or firing
rockets on Israeli working class]{.mark}]{.underline} neighborhoods.
Such desperate actions are no threat to the Israeli state; they only
terrorize the Israeli workers. The first suicide attack in Palestinian
history came on 16th April 1993, and can be viewed as a result of
desperation due to the failure of the revolution and the onset of
reaction in Palestinian society. This revolution also heightened the
yearning for a solution by the Israeli workers and brought them closer
to the Palestinian masses, unlike the rockets and bombings, which have
had the opposite effect.

Against the blanket boycott of Israel - for a working class solution For
a working class approach The working class has proven, time and again,
its power when united[[. Only organized working class action will help
liberate the Palestinian masses]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[not vague
consumer boycotts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Palestinian masses have
shown amazing heroism, enough to put through a dozen revolutions, but
the reality is that only [[one force can overthrow Israeli
imperialism---the Jewish and Arab Israeli working class.]{.mark}
[Without their work, not a single gear moves in the factories of
Israel]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israeli imperialism is built on the myth
that the Israeli worker and boss share a common interest and should
stand together for mutual defence. Our task is to explode this myth, and
our tactics must take this into account. Something must be done, on this
we agree. What kind of tactics would a working class campaign undertake?
There is [[only one kind of boycott]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[was
effective during]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[South African
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}: the [[targeted union
boycott]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Workers\' unions on the docks refused to
load any arms shipments destined for South Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} is a very clear
[[method]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[relies not on petitioning
corporations, or]{.underline}]{.mark} appeals to the [[tricksters in the
UN]{.underline}]{.mark} or in parliament[[, but on immediate and
vigorous implementation by the working class]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Activists should launch a campaign, based on union affiliation, where
armaments workers, transport workers, and postal workers refuse to fill
weapons orders meant for Israeli imperialism. The Canadian Union of
Postal Workers has signed on to BDS. Instead of calling on its workers
to boycott Israeli goods, the union should call on its members to refuse
to deliver any mail to SNC-Lavalin or similar weapons companies so long
as they build weapons for Israeli capitalism.
[[Alongside]{.mark}]{.underline} this union campaign, [[mass
demonstrations]{.underline}]{.mark} can be organized [[against visiting
representatives of Israeli imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Current
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was given a spectacular welcome by
thousands of protesters when he attempted to speak at Concordia
University in 2003. This is correct; such criminals and apologists for
Zionism should be shut down. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of
[[tactics, which differentiate between the Israeli workers and their
ruling class, are the kinds of]{.underline}]{.mark} working class
[[methods that]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[help the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Israeli and [[Palestinian working masses overthrow Israeli
imperialism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Class unity and the fight for
socialism **[[There is no force on Earth other than the Israeli working
class that can destroy Israeli imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Unity
between the Israeli proletariat and the Palestinian toilers and
fallaheen (farmers) is the first necessity for carrying out a revolution
that will end the bloodshed once and for all. The movement in solidarity
must be based on that unity. We reject the perspective of \"Jews to the
sea\". [[The solution will not come without working class Israeli
Jews]{.underline}]{.mark}; they will play the central role! [[This is
why we reject the BDS campaign as counter-productive, and a campaign
that strengthens bourgeois Zionism.]{.mark}]{.underline} We reject any
attempt to place blame on the Israeli workers for the crimes of their
ruling class, no less than we reject attempts to blame the Palestinian
masses for the blood spilt by Hamas and Fatah. The blame rests squarely
on the shoulders of the Israeli and Palestinian bourgeoisies, and the
capitalist classes in the US, Canada and the rest of the western world.
This is why the workers and youth in the advanced capitalist countries
cannot stop at solidarity[[. This fight must be linked to the fight for
socialism at home.]{.underline}]{.mark} Our imperialists profit from
these wars, and [[the only solution is a movement to throw them out here
as well]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Capitalism worldwide must be
overthrown.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [[Jewish and the Palestinian
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[have a strong socialist and
revolutionary history]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[With help from the
international workers' and solidarity movement]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[they will]{.underline}]{.mark} be able to find the way back to these
traditions and [[throw nationalism and fundamentalism on both sides to
the trash pile]{.underline}]{.mark}. Freed from fratricidal warfare and
the meddling of imperialism, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Palestinian and
Israeli working [[masses would be]{.underline}]{.mark} able to unite in
a voluntary socialist union of both peoples as [[the first step
towards]{.underline}]{.mark} a Socialist Federation of the Middle
East[[: liberating]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} and using them [[for human need instead
of for profit]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to rapidly develop in common and
rise out of the collective misery. Therefore, we appeal to all those who
fight for the liberation of the Palestinian peoples to adopt the
following course of action: Abandon the blanket boycott of Israel, which
pushes the Israeli workers into the arms of the imperialists. Adopt a
workers' boycott that targets the Israeli state and representatives of
the regime. Promote strategies that build solidarity between Jewish and
Arab workers. Fight for socialism, both at home and in the Middle East.

How BDS strengthens Zionism Israeli capitalism, no less than South
African capitalism, rests on the exploitation of a working class
majority by a bourgeois minority. Only in this case, the working class
is made up of Jewish-Israelis, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship
(20% of Israeli citizens), and Palestinians living in the occupied
territories. [[BDS essentially takes the approach]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[Israel is one monolithic reactionary bloc]{.underline}]{.mark},
Jewish workers and bosses all happily united in the oppression of the
Palestinian people. This, however, is an over-simplification of the real
position. It is true that the Israeli ruling class for historical
reasons has succeeded in rallying the majority of the Jewish workers in
Israel behind the banner of the defence of the Israeli state against the
"Arab threat". But [[the difference between the ruling class and the
workers is that the Israeli working class]{.underline}]{.mark} --
objectively speaking -- [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} absolutely [[no
interest in oppressing the Palestinian masses]{.underline}]{.mark}.
While the [[bourgeoisie makes billions of]{.underline}]{.mark} dollars
off of the production of [[weapons and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[slaughter]{.underline}]{.mark} of innocents, [[the working class has
to watch its]{.underline}]{.mark} (((*[[CHILDREN]{.underline}]{.mark}*))
INSERTED BY CARD CUTTER )sons and daughters sent off to [[die in wars
for profit]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the profits soar, homelessness,
unemployment, and tuition fees continue their ascent. While the
[[millionaires]{.underline}]{.mark} in Tel Aviv
[[build]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[tower]{.underline}]{.mark}ing office
building[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} to turn it into a \"financial centre\",
[[working class Jews are]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly finding
themselves [[expelled]{.mark}]{.underline} from that city
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} political and deliberate [[rent
increases]{.underline}]{.mark}. Just as in the West, war expenditure is
used in Israel as an excuse to cut back on social security and decent
conditions for public sector workers. Like in any other country in the
world, there are [[contradictions]{.underline}]{.mark} developing within
Israeli society that [[are deepening the class divide and under certain
conditions may express themselves through a rise in the class
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}. The bourgeoisie is attempting to play a
demographics game to force working class Israeli Jews out of the cities
and into the countryside, where there is a danger that Arab-Israeli
citizens will become a majority. This has led to a struggle, and
culminated in a massive increase in support in the Tel Aviv municipal
elections (November 2008) for the Israeli Communist Party---a party
started by Palestinian-Israelis. The bosses, as always, attempted to
play up national hatreds, playing up the fact that the ICP stands for
the right of return for Palestinian refugees. It did not work. The ICP
received the same amount of council seats as the ruling party and
received 35% of the vote for mayor, a historic breakthrough. (see:
[http://www.marxist.com/israel-tel-aviv-municipal-elections-2008.htm](https://www.marxist.com/israel-tel-aviv-municipal-elections-2008.htm))
These event in the largest city in Israel cannot be dismissed as
irrelevant and shows the potential for policies not based on religious
or ethnic hatred but the common interests of the Jewish-Israeli and
Palestinian-Israeli workers. [[There have also been a series of recent
general strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}, during which [[the unity of
Arab-Israeli and Jewish-Israeli workers has been on marvelous
display]{.underline}]{.mark}. In these strikes, [[Palestinian-Israelis
have often been in the forefront,]{.underline}]{.mark} leading the way
with radical tactics such as public sector workers directly collecting
taxes in order to receive their backlog of unpaid wages. [[These
developments are incredibly dangerous to the capitalist
class]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is the real reason behind the wars in
Lebanon and Gaza: distraction and division. The bourgeoisie, faced with
the danger of a united proletariat, conjures up fears and hatreds to sow
division and distract the working classes from their common interests
and common enemy: the Israeli capitalists. [[Zionism is the ideology
used by the Israeli capitalists to draw the workers behind their bosses,
and cut across the class divide through \"national unity\" against the
external threat. They perpetually underline the fear of the Israeli
masses of being an isolated people, surrounded by enemies on all
sides]{.underline}]{.mark}. They opportunistically play on the
historical memory of the holocaust to convince the Jewish-Israeli
working class that they are universally hated and their only allies are
the Israeli bourgeois. [[BDS attempts to achieve its demands by actively
seeking to make that isolation a reality]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore -- against the wishes of those who
support it as a useful tool to weaken Zionism -- [[useful for
solidifying Zionism.]{.underline}]{.mark}

forward, at that time) and explained the importance of those formations
also appealing to white workers and involving them in the struggle --

prejudices and racist views. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} was done with
the purpose of [[help]{.underline}]{.mark}ing to [[split and undermine

manner which, in fact, [[undermined the basis for an ethnic civil

adopted by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the

[[For Jewish Zionists in the diaspora]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether

it is tragic that 80% of the Palestinian residents within what would

state, full stop. They support the right of Palestinian refugees to
return to the state of Palestine, not to Israel. This is among the
primary reasons that they are so troubled by the prospect that there
will never be a West Bank-Gaza state[[: few dispute that refugees have a
right to return to their homeland]{.underline}]{.mark} -- this is, after
all, the founding idea of Zionism -- but with no Palestinian state there
is no good liberal answer to where Palestinians should return to.

### Alt solves BDS Demands

#### Class based resistance only hope for to address economic and political violence -- political solutions that fail to foreground class guarantee failure -- alt results in the rights BSM asks for

necessity of a class approach and a socialist alternative,

Our organisation on the national and international level is fully
committed to promoting internationalist solidarity with the struggle of
the Palestinian masses for liberation from national oppression, and is
committed also to contribute to the discussion in relation to the way in
which this struggle could win.

Generally, and particularly given the moods today and the brutal
intensification of repressive measures used against the Palestinians,
[[would it be not right to promote]{.underline}]{.mark} today a
programme of '[[two states']{.mark}]{.underline} to solve the conflict?
But in the context of the capitalist Middle East today [[the meaning of
this demand is indeed the founding of a neo-colonial puppet state for
the Palestinians, and not genuine national
independence]{.underline}]{.mark}. The fundamental problems of the
Palestinian masses would not be solved and the bloody conflict would
continue.

Moreover, the idea of a bi-national state is completely utopian in a
capitalist context -- the decisive majority of both nationalities are
not interested in giving up national independence and [[sharing a single
state, and even if such a state would be coerced somehow, it would be
based on inequality and a deep national schism.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This fact underlines that at this stage, even while the slogan of 'two
states' in itself comes into increased suspicion, the idea of a solution
based on two national states -- although in a socialist context -- is
still necessary. At this stage, advancing a programme which proposes a
solution in the form of one joint state for both nationalities, even a
socialist state, is not capable of supplying a basic answer to the
fears, suspicions and the intense yearning for national independence on
the part of both national groups. Nevertheless, the role of the Marxist
left is also to explain that working class layers and the masses of all
national groups have an interest, at root, in a united struggle around a
programme for socialist change.

Although significant struggles could definitely gain important
achievements before, [[only on a socialist basis will it be possible to
equate the living conditions of the Palestinians to those of the
Israelis]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and [[to raise]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
fact, the general [[living standards far beyond the
best]{.underline}]{.mark} conditions that could possibly be achieved
under [[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[[guarantee a complete equality of rights in all
spheres]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Only that way would it be possible to
make sure that all resources in society serve rationally and
democratically the welfare of the masses, and also allow the necessary
investment of resources for the Palestinian
refugees]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a just solution which requires a
struggle to guarantee conditions of welfare and equality in the region,
and advancing of direct dialogue and consent, which would include
recognition of the historic injustice and the right to return. In these
circumstances, the diminishing of mutual loathing and national schism
may prepare the ground also for a joint socialist state.

A new boycott campaign has been gaining an echo within the Palestinian
solidarity movement. This campaign is known as "Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions", BDS for short. Sometimes it is referred to as the campaign
against Israeli Apartheid. We truly believe that the supporters of this
campaign are acting from a genuine desire to end the suffering of the
Palestinian people. However, we have to frankly say that we do not
believe that the methods of this campaign can defeat Israeli
imperialism. What is notable about this campaign is that it ignores the
question of class in both Israel and Palestine. We believe that only a
working class approach can put an end to Israeli imperialism. What is
BDS and who supports it? The campaign for
[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}oycott, [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}ivestment and
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}anctions [[was launched]{.underline}]{.mark} on
9th July, 2005 [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} a \"unified call\" drawing
together more than one hundred Palestinian organizations. Amongst these
are the Ramallah [[Chamber of Commerce]{.underline}]{.mark}, some PLO
popular committees, the Palestinian General Federation of Trade
[[Unions]{.underline}]{.mark}, the General Union of Palestinian
Teachers, the Federation of Unions of Palestinian University Professors
and Employees, the Palestinian Engineers' Association, the Palestinian
Lawyers\' Association, [[and an alphabet soup of NGOs and \"civil
society\" groups]{.underline}]{.mark} in the occupied territories and
Israel itself. [[These groups have elected a \"Boycott National
Committee]{.underline}]{.mark}\", which has been entrusted to lead the
campaign as well as manage the official website, BDSmovement.net. The
campaign has been able to gain the support of some trade unions in
Canada, such as the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and the Fédération
Autonome du Collégial teachers\' union in Quebec. It also has an
extensive list of supporters worldwide. [Its demands on the Israeli
state are laid out in the original call]{.underline}: \"1.
[End]{.underline}ing its [occupation]{.underline} and colonization of
all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall; 2. [Recognizing]{.underline}
the [fundamental rights of]{.underline} the Arab-Palestinian citizens of
Israel to [full equality]{.underline}; and 3[. Respecting, protecting,
and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their
homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.]{.underline}\"
[The BDS]{.underline} campaign is an international campaign for consumer
and academic boycotts, pressure tactics to push corporations and
universities to take investments out of Israeli companies and companies
with major Israeli interests, and a broader call for economic sanctions
against the Israeli state. It is also accompanied by \"cultural\" and
\"sports\" boycotts. Furthermore, even though some less informed
supporters may claim a more targeted approach, the consumer [[boycott
is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[clearly intended to be a blanket boycott
of all Israeli goods, as pointed out on the official BDSmovement.net
website]{.underline}]{.mark}: "Raise awareness among consumers about the
consequences of buying Israeli goods and services. Pressurize
supermarkets and shops into removing goods with barcode 729 - denoting
Israeli origin - from their shelves. Encourage companies who make use of
Israeli technology and components to find alternatives and join the
boycott. Focus the attention of the world on Israeli occupation and
apartheid and expose those who bankroll the Israeli regime; and to
foster an environment in which it is unacceptable to promote Israeli
policies." Many young activists are supporting this campaign because of
an honest feeling that something must be done. In discussions with BDS
activists, when the point has been raised that [[this
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} [[does nothing to weaken Israeli
imperialism and in fact pushes Israeli workers and youth into the arms
of imperialists]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the response has been \"well, at
least the campaign has raised awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}\". We are
prepared to concede this point; the campaign has received much media
attention. However, [[not a single Palestinian family has ever been
saved from having their house knocked down thanks to a letter to the
Toronto Star or the Montreal Gazette]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[People were
also aware of the Iraq war]{.underline}]{.mark}. 50 million people
demonstrated worldwide in March 2003. But this [[awareness]{.mark} did
not stop US imperialism]{.underline}. [[Neither will it stop Israeli
imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}. What we need is an approach that can
defeat imperialism.

#### BDS movement only fuels Zionism -- it is seen as too extreme which drives away the centrists needed

But whereas the [[BDS movement is betting that this exposure will lead
people to conclude that Zionism is fundamentally racist and should be
rejected]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Kuperwasser]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
one, [[is convinced it is the Palestinians who will be
unmasked]{.underline}]{.mark}. "The Palestinians are taking a very big
risk," he said. "Because, in my mind, [[there is a good chance that the
world will deny their conceptual framework]{.underline}]{.mark}. People
will say: '[[This is what the Palestinians want?! We are totally against
it ...]{.underline}]{.mark} They are crazy; [[they want Israel to
disappear]{.underline}]{.mark}.'" If that happens, he added, the
Palestinians won't even get a West Bank-Gaza state, which he believes
the PLO still sees as merely the first stage toward liberating all of
Palestine.

#### Undermining capitalism is a precondition to undermine the settler colonialist project -- the aff's activism gets spun by the media to cause the public to FEAR PALESTINIANS -- not an indictment of Israel

**Shupak 9/29** (Greg Shupak teaches media studies at the University of
Guelph in Canada. He is the author of the upcoming book, [The Wrong

To understand why Western [[news outlets proffer narratives about
Palestine-Israel that favor Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is necessary
to consider these media outlets' political function. Joseph
Uscinski [explains](https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=i1cTCgAAQBAJ&q=There+is+no+doubt+that+systemic+economic+forces+such+as+the+need+to+sell+advertising+space+and+manage+expenditures%2C+determine+the+actions+of+news+firms#v=snippet&q=There%20is%20no%20doubt%20that%20systemic%20economic%20forces%20such%20as%20the%20need%20to%20sell%20advertising%20space%20and%20manage%20expenditures%2C%20determine%20the%20actions%20of%20news%20firms&f=false) that,
"There is no doubt that [[systemic economic forces such as the need to
sell advertising space]{.underline}]{.mark} and manage expenditures,
[[determine the actions of news firms]{.underline}]{.mark}." Multiple
studies demonstrate that the [[commercial
orientation]{.underline}]{.mark} of news media
[[shapes]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[content]{.underline}]{.mark}. An
early 1990s [academic
survey](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4188851?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
of editors at daily newspapers finds that just under 90 percent reported
that advertisers attempted to influence the content of stories appearing
in their papers and 90 percent of them had advertisers apply economic
pressure to them because of their reporting; 37 percent admit to
capitulating to advertiser pressure. Another academic survey of daily
newspapers, this one [published in
2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/JOA0091-3367360208),
finds that there are "fre­quent conflicts between the business side and
the journalism side of newspaper operations" and that "advertising
directors are will­ing to appease their advertisers, and are also willing
to positively respond to advertisers' requests." The survey suggests
that this problem is particularly acute at chain-owned newspapers, which
are especially prone to compromising editorial integrity to either
please their advertisers or keep from offending them. A similar problem
exists in television, where
[polls](https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=i1cTCgAAQBAJ&q=There+is+no+doubt+that+systemic+economic+forces+such+as+the+need+to+sell+advertising+space+and+manage+expenditures%2C+determine+the+actions+of+news+firms#v=onepage&q&f=false)
of network news correspondents say that nearly one-third feel directly
pressured to report certain stories and not others because of owners' or
adver­tisers' financial concerns. When coverage of Palestine-Israel is
viewed in the context of commercial media, it is no surprise that
narratives about the issue that are favorable to Israel are as prevalent
as they are. The [[outlets covering Palestine-Israel are embedded in a
system of global imperialist capitalism built around US
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}, of which [Israel is an important
feature](https://monthlyreview.org/2007/03/01/israel-in-the-u-s-empire/).
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} overall func­tioning of the international
capitalist system of which the com­mercial media are a part is
[guaranteed by the US

**[[[American

strategy for dominance of the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The
millionaire and billionaire owners of media outlets and of the
advertisers that fund them are unambiguously part of the ruling
class]{.underline}]{.mark}. The same is true, at least in the case of
major national or international news organiz­ations, of editors and
often, as Faiza Hirji [points
out](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?8828809&uuid=66118fa0-f60f-40df-88e1-2d789f6096bb),
journalists themselves, who "belong to a societal elite" and
"contribute, however, unconsciously to reinforcing existing notions
about the way the world is." One could add that such ideological
administration also involves shaping beliefs about how the world should
be and is capable of being. The stories of Palestine-Israel examined in
my book suggest that elites involved in the news-making pro­cess believe
that the [violent
oppression](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/israels-nation-state-law-netanyahu)
of Palestinians and the permanent consigning of them to the status of
refugees and state­less persons is no great injustice, and that American
stewardship of the Middle East is necessary and desirable. The
Palestine-Israel narratives discussed throughout my book are case
studies in the harmful effects of the capitalist character of news
media. Uscinski
[describes](https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=i1cTCgAAQBAJ&q=There+is+no+doubt+that+systemic+economic+forces+such+as+the+need+to+sell+advertising+space+and+manage+expenditures%2C+determine+the+actions+of+news+firms#v=onepage&q&f=false)
the commercial orientation of news media as a "market failure" with a
signifi­cant "negative externalit\[y\]." "Low-quality news," he writes,
"provides a low-quality information environment for democrat­ic
decision-making." The three widespread narratives about Palestine-Israel
discussed throughout my book are, as I have shown, highly misleading. An
accurate rendering of the story would tell of Israel
[violently](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/04/israel-palestine-gaza-occupation-protests)
colonizing Palestine, with vital US support, and functioning as a
garrison for US-led imper­ialist capitalism. Instead news media outlets
present [fables in which both Israelis and
Palestinians](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/07/a-plague-on-one-house)
have subjected each other to comparable wrongs and are blameworthy to a
similar extent for the unresolved status of Palestine. Readers are also
offered [disorienting accounts saying the problem is that
extrem­ists](http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/wrong-story-palestine-israel-and-media)
are driving events in Palestine-Israel rather than moderates. Equally
unhelpful are the tales the news tells about Israel's [sup­posed "right
to defend
itself."](http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/how-media-denies-palestinians-their-humanity-1875505188)
[[Providing the public with]{.mark}]{.underline} such "[[low-quality
information"]{.underline}]{.mark} about the issue [[distorts "democratic
decision-making"]{.mark}]{.underline} by **[[decreasing the likelihood
of portions of the populations of America and other Western countries
substantial enough to compel policy changes coming to recognize that
their governments' support for Israeli settler-colonial capitalism has
devastating consequences for the Palestinians and proliferates war in
the Middle East.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The social role of commercially
oriented media, by which I mean news organizations that exist to make a
profit and even those that do not but seek advertising revenue, is to
advance ruling class interests. The Western media is managed by the
Western ruling class and tells stories that steer the public toward
attitudes favorable to that ruling class. As Hirji explains, "If there
is a dominant narrative about a particular story or group, that
nar­rative is likely informed by power relations: who has it, who does
not have it, who wants to keep the status quo." Such dominant narratives
include perspectives on Palestine-Israel amenable to a situation wherein
the US ensures that Israel remains the domin­ant military power in the
region because that benefits US political and economic objectives.
Stories hospitable to the ruling class proliferate in a media climate
[characterized by](http://javnost-thepublic.org/article/2014/3/1/) a
"commercial system ... \[that\] favors content that serves commercial
inter­ests. Markets favor speech that favors markets." As [Entman
argues](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/43/4/51/4160153?redirectedFrom=fulltext),
moreover, framing "plays a major role in the exertion of political
power, and the frame in a news text is really the imprint of power ---
it registers the identity of actors or interests that com­peted to
dominate the text." The way in which an issue is framed and the stories
that arise from that framing have to be considered in the context of
elite ownership over Western media. That [[the Western ruling class
controls the media and is deeply invested in Israeli settler-colonial
capitalism but has no comparable interests in Palestinian
liberation]{.underline}]{.mark} is crucial to grasp­ing why Western news
outlets circulate narratives favorable to Israel. The people in charge
of these outlets do not necessarily hatch conscious plots to trick the
population into believing mis­leading tales about Palestine-Israel. The
institutional orientation of news organizations steers them toward
consistently framing issues in ways beneficial to the class to which
they belong whether the topic is Palestine-Israel or any number of other
subjects. [[**For the question of Palestine to be resolved**, **the
Western ruling class** will have to be prevented from backing Israel as
a means of dominating the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}. Because of
Western mili­tary, financial, and political support for Israel, public
opinion in Western societies has a role to play in bringing a just,
de-colonial peace across historic Palestine. [[Western states will not
undertake the massive policy shifts necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} for
that to happen unless mass pressure compels them to do so. Yet [[the
structure of Western news media suggests it is unlikely to begin telling
stories about Pales­tine-Israel that are less weighted in Israel's favor,
which means that this formidable barrier to building the popular
sentiments necessary to stop Western imperialism will remain in place
for the foreseeable future]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Case if Anti-Blackness

#### Intra state anti-black violence

#### BDS will mirror South African Anti-Apartheid tactics

The [[BDS movement unabashedly]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[taken a page
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the successful playbook of the [[South African
anti-apartheid movement]{.underline}]{.mark}. Like Israeli Jews today,
the vast majority of South Africa's white population opposed a
democratic state and clung to their domination over the Black population
until the bitter end. But the domestic resistance of Black South
Africans combined with the pressure from the international
anti-apartheid movement led to a total loss of legitimacy of the
apartheid regime. Like today, some argued that the boycott would harm
the very people the movement aimed to help. Yet then as now, the
indigenous population was both the initiator and defender of the call
for boycott, divestment, and sanctions. Today, [[some of the same
figures who led the South African movement are speaking out against
Israel's apartheid and advocating BDS]{.underline}]{.mark}. "The same
issues of inequality and injustice today motivate the divestment
movement trying to end Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian
territory and the unfair and prejudicial treatment of the Palestinian
people by the Israeli government ruling over them,"^27^argues South
Africa's Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]{.underline}]{.mark}. South African
anti-apartheid activists [[Suraya Dado]{.underline}]{.mark} and Muhammed
Desai insist a debt of gratitude is owed: "It is our duty as South
Africans to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people."^28^ The
fake shanty towns that college students set up on their campuses to
portray the segregation and misery of life in South Africa's Black slums
has an echo in the mock checkpoints BDS activists set up to dramatize
daily conditions for Palestinians trying to travel from home to work.
The days-long teach-ins of the South African anti-apartheid movement
have their match in the annual Israeli Apartheid Week, which celebrated
its tenth year this winter. The phony apartheid passbooks identifying
people by their race that students made in the eighties have their
counterpart in the faux eviction notices passed under dormroom doors to
educate students about what the IDF does before violently driving
Palestinians from their homes. The examples are growing as an older
generation shares its experiences with their young peers in the
movement, and [[workshops on lessons from the South African
anti-apartheid movement have become de rigueur at BDS
conferences]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### This Hides internalized anti-black violence -- there are black bodies on both sides of the Palestinian Israeli and South Africa conflicts -- their historical understanding promoted in the 1ac and among advocates mystifies anti-black violence

To speak of blackness as "unthought" is not to speak of ignorance then,
nor is it even to mean unconsidered. We can say very definitively that
[[black suffering]{.underline}]{.mark} is not simply unknown, but
actually [[remains a central metaphor for how people
understand]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[solidarity against
Israel.]{.underline}]{.mark} People's statements of support are full of
similes: [["this is like the boycott of South
Africa..."]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[Israeli occupation is like
segregation..."]{.mark}]{.underline} etc. [[Black suffering becomes the
gold standard of evaluating other people's suffering and the foundation
for our moral outrage]{.underline}]{.mark} and political maneuvering.
What is tragic here is that the metaphor was unnecessary, for [[**the
metaphor elides the existence of black bodies on the ground on both
sides of the wall catching hell from both sides of this conflict**.
Black flesh exists as the unknown term in the Israel/Palestine conflict,
the void off the map of political contestation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[success of BDS in]{.underline}]{.mark} the

[[is]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark}:

1.  Unprecedented [[exposure of Israel's brutal

    Operation Cast Lead in the winter of 2008--09 and the 2010 massacre
    of nine unarmed civilians aboard a humanitarian aid vessel in
    international waters, the Mavi Marmara.

2.  The leadership of what may be called Generation Palestine^7^, mostly
    young Arab-Americans and Muslims, but also many young Jews and
    others, who came of age in the atmosphere of heightened Islamophobia
    and anti-Arab racism in the post--9/11 United States.

3.  The [[application of methods used in the successful South African
    anti-apartheid movement that spread to US campuses and reached a
    crescendo in the 1980s]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Arguably, each of these developments discussed below is a result of and
leads to many more, but these appear to be three [[key catalysts in the
rising US BDS movement]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Travel is not the only serious limitation faculty would face. A
significant number of American, Israeli, and Palestinian faculty are
involved in interinstitutional research projects funded both by their
own universities and by grants they administer. These critical
collaborations would collapse under a boycott regime. Butler says she
has "no problem collaborating with Israeli scholars and artists as long
as we do not participate in any Israeli institution or have Israeli
state monies support our collaborative work." Refusing such financial
support is a good deal easier for a philosopher than a scientist or an
engineer who requires lab space, equipment, and staff to carry out
research. Academic freedom includes the right to pursue the research of
your choice, including collaborative research, and the right to pursue
the funding necessary for that work. Butler dismisses the limitations a
boycott would impose as a mere "inconvenience," but faculty members who
find their collaborative research projects on desalinization or solar
energy torpedoed are certain to use stronger language.

[[Nearly all]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [[corporate and student-led
divestments have been selective]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[they have not
targeted Israel as a whole, but only settlements and
occupation]{.underline}]{.mark}. A number of them had little to do with
the BDS movement itself. But [[both the Israeli government and the BDS
movement]{.mark}]{.underline} have tended to [[obscure
this]{.underline}]{.mark} fact. Doing so has helped the BDS movement
appear to rack up victories, and it has helped the Israeli government to
discredit cautious bureaucratic initiatives to adhere to international
law, casting them instead as unhinged, demonising efforts by BDS
radicals.

[[Conflating boycotts]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
settlements [[with opposition to Israel's existence has been a central
element of the government's policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, reflecting a
desire not just to protect settlements but to stem the tide of selective
boycotts that could spread to Israel as a whole. "We are saying there is
no difference between a settlement boycott and a boycott of Israel,"
Yossi Kuperwasser said. "If you want to promote the boycotting of
Israel, any part of Israel, you are not a friend of Israel. You are
actually an enemy of Israel. So we have to deal with you."

The government has passed a law that bars entry to foreigners who have
publicly supported a boycott of Israel "or an area under its control".
Its minister of strategic affairs has called for imposing financial
penalties on Israeli organisations, companies and in some cases
individuals who advocate boycotts of either Israel or the settlements.
After Hagai El-Ad, the head of the Israeli human rights organisation
B'Tselem, addressed the UN security council and called on it to take
action against Israel's occupation, the chairman of the governing
coalition called to revoke his citizenship and to create a bill that
would do the same to any Israeli who calls on international bodies to
take action against Israel.

Israel and its allies have pursued the same strategy abroad. In 2014,
Netanyahu convened a meeting of top Israeli ministers to discuss
possible counter-BDS measures, including, according to the Israeli daily
Haaretz, "legal suits in European and North American courts against
\[BDS\] organisations", "legal action against financial institutions
that boycott settlements", and "whether to activate the pro-Israel lobby
in the US, specifically Aipac, in order to promote legislation in
Congress". Since then, major banks around the world have shut down the
accounts of pro-BDS groups. In 24 US states, bills and orders that
stifle free speech by discouraging, penalising or restricting support
for boycotts of Israel or of settlements have been passed, and have been
challenged in two states so far by the ACLU. Following Hurricane Harvey,
last summer, the city of Dickinson, Texas required residents who wanted
relief to [certify that they do not and will not boycott
Israel](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/texas-hurricane-aid-dickinson-israel-boycott-pledge-harvey-financial-help-free-speech-a8011141.html),
a demand the ACLU's Texas legal director called "an egregious violation
of the first amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths". A
federal anti-boycott bill supported by Aipac has also met with
opposition by the ACLU, which argues that "political boycotts are fully
protected by the first amendment", regardless of whether the boycott is
of Israel or the settlements.

This deliberate elision of Israel and the settlements has caused no
small amount of consternation among the state's more liberal supporters
in the American Jewish community. For years they have sought to protect
Israel itself from sanction, by arguing that only boycotts of
settlements are legitimate. Now they feel themselves under attack not
just from BDS, on the left, but the Israeli government, on the right,
both of which disdain the centre-left notion of being "pro-Israel and
anti-occupation", and both of which reject the position that wine
produced in West Bank settlements should be boycotted while the
government that created, financed and maintained the settlements should
not.

Israel's strategy has been to force a choice on companies subjected to
pressure to withdraw or divest: stay in Israeli-controlled territory and
ignore the boycott campaign, or accede to its demands and face potential
lawsuits and losses in much bigger markets in Europe and the US. Given
that choice, Kuperwasser said, most companies would be very reluctant to
withdraw from Israel or the settlements: "But if it's going to happen,
there are going to be more laws around the world that are going to make

#### BDS victories just cause Israeli crackdowns not success

To Israeli liberals, the gravest threat from BDS is that it has induced
in their government a reaction so reckless and overreaching that it
resembles a sort of auto-immune disease, in which the battle against BDS
also damages the rights of ordinary citizens and the organs of
democracy. Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs has utilised the
intelligence services to surveil and attack delegitimisers of Israel. It
called to establish a blacklist of Israeli organisations and citizens
who support the nonviolent boycott campaign, created a "tarnishing unit"
to besmirch the reputations of boycott supporters, and placed paid
articles in the Israeli press. Leftwing Israeli Jews have been summoned
for interrogation or stopped at the border by agents of the Shin Bet,
Israel's internal security agency, who described themselves as officers
working against delegitimisation. Israel has banned 20 organisations
from entry for their political opinions, including the American Friends
Service Committee, a Quaker group that won a Nobel peace prize for
helping Holocaust refugees and that now supports self-determination for
Israelis and Palestinians while also endorsing BDS. To Israeli liberals,

### Israel focus bad

#### Targetting Israel won't work -- most of anti-BDS campaigns are carried on outside of Israel

The [[Ministry of Strategic Affairs]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[outsourced much of its anti-BDS activity in foreign
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[helping to establish and finance front
groups and partner organisations]{.underline}]{.mark}, in an attempt to
minimise the appearance of Israeli interference in the domestic politics
of its allies in Europe and the US. Kuper said that anti-BDS groups were
now "sprouting like mushrooms after the rain". He and a number of other
former intelligence and security officials are members of one of them,
Kella Shlomo, described as a "PR commando unit" that will work with and
receive tens of millions of dollars from the Ministry of Strategic
Affairs. In 2016, Israel's embassy in London sent a cable to Jerusalem
complaining that the strategic affairs ministry was endangering British
Jewish organisations, most of which are registered as charities and
forbidden from political activity: "'operating' Jewish organisations
directly from Jerusalem ... is liable to be dangerous" and "could
encounter opposition from the organisations themselves, given their
legal status; Britain isn't the US!" Last year, al-Jazeera aired
undercover recordings of an Israeli official working out of the London
embassy, who described being asked by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs
to [help establish a "private company" in the
UK](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/israeli-diplomat-shai-masot-plotted-against-mps-set-up-political-groups-labour)that
would work for the Israeli government and in liaison with pro-Israel
groups like Aipac.

### Solidarity Bad???/AT: Perm

#### Unequivocal solidarity justifies Palestinian anti-blackness

**\**
There is always a moral or ethical reason to stand with the oppressed,
and many do so accordingly, but for true solidarity to be present there
must be a common goal, for Blacks in the US and for Palestinians, we are
fighting systems of dehumanization which both invoke and advance white
supremacy. I often think of the heavily cited James Baldwin quote "To be
a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a
rage almost all the time".\
\
[[Although we can make argument for the moral, strategic, and passionate
justification for]{.underline}]{.mark} this
[[solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[there are Palestinians who are
anti-black]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is difficult to name a community
that is not since the subjugation of Blacks is definitive of U.S.
society. [[Some are anti-black because of their intention to assimilate
into whiteness; other factors add into this dynamic as
well]{.underline}]{.mark}. In January 2015, the Dream Defenders
organized a delegation to Palestine. In part, the purpose was to expose
oppressed communities in the U.S. to the Palestinian struggle, and its
relation to, and implications for, life in the heart of the U.S. empire.
It was also also a moment to show Palestinians that these communities
identify with our struggles. None of our communities can do this alone,
so Palestinians should know that there are those in the belly of the
beast who are just as hungry for true liberation.

It's really more than a competing history of oppression. Blackness is
the constant creation of death in order to allow the potential of life
and living power of others. And this is what we see today, it is a
continuous death. Analytically if you discuss something that is dead it
is no longer there; legally you have to have a death certificate,
medically you need to have a dead body but it's this fear of the living
power of the Palestinian body and the fear of the Black dead body and
living body that puts us in the same category. It's a part of the
necropolitical framework, one that reflects the political economy of
life and death in its everydayness, in its intimacy, its sexuality, its
economic gains, and its geopolitical scope.\
\
Solidarity is about death and social death. We are talking about two
groups that are globally perceived as living dead. As a Palestinian, I
see clearly, that on a global level, Palestinians do not have a right to
exist. Israelis have a right to exist because of a Biblical right and in
that narrative we are invaders and are disturbing a world order. This is
where I see solidarity between Blacks and Palestinians because the
political economy of Blackness is the political economy of
Palestinianness whereby there is other-ization and being perceived in
zoological terms, in the Fanon sense. Consider the Balfour Declaration-
therein we are not even people to be consulted. And the same can be said
of Blacks- who are slaves and should not be consulted. They are not
there to be consulted, we are not even people.
