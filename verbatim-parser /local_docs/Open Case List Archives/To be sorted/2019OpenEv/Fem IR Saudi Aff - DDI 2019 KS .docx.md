### Plan

#### Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce arms sales by prohibiting Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales from the United States to the State of Israel.

### Advantage: Settler-Colonialism

#### US Arms are used continuously by the Zionistic Israeli police state to murder innocent Palestinians, placing the American people and government in immediate implicity to destruction and violent takeover of culturally and historically significant Palestinian land, storied now by fake settler imagination. This turns into cyclical perpetuation of settlement and colonialism, exacerbated by "back-scratching" and special privilege leveraged between America and Israel, covered up by Trumpian rhetoric, excused by the American military industrial complex, and turned deadly on a genocidal scale by arms exports.

Basic Law of 1980](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/520) and the
[Jerusalem Embassy Act of
1995](http://time.com/5049019/jerusalem-embassy-history/) were highly
controversial because of their timing and their political and legal
implications,]{.underline}** according to [Michael
Zank](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/629170/summary), a professor at
Boston University. Both laws were enacted during times when the
international coalition was making progress with the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations. U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Egyptian President
Anwar al-Sadat had signed the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty with
Israel and Egypt in 1979; consequently, the Jerusalem Basic Law
endangered the peace process and negatively impacted the ongoing
negotiations. The Jerusalem Embassy Act was signed into law shortly
after the Oslo Accords were concluded and greatly affected the final
status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that
were held at Camp David in 2000. Both these legislative acts created a
binding relationship between Israel and the U.S which ultimately changed
the status quo. **[But [to fully conceptualize the U.S.-Israel special
relationship we need to unpack the]{.mark} the preferential [arms trade
agreements]{.mark} that allows for this relationship to continue at the
expense of the indigenous population in the occupied
territories.]{.underline}** Max Ajl, a PhD candidate in development
sociology at Cornell University,
[writes](http://inthesetimes.com/article/19479/the-israeli-aid-package-10-more-years-of-the-special-relationship):
***["U.S. 'military assistance,' [more accurately understood as a
circular flow through which U.S. weapons firms profit off the
colonization of Palestinian land and Israeli destabilization of the
surrounding states]{.mark}, is a long-term structuring element of the
U.S.-Israel 'special relationship.]{.underline}**'*" **[U.S. military
[loans](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-u-s-foreign-aid-to-israel)
started arriving in Israel in November 1971]{.underline}**, when the
Nixon administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel to
build up its domestic industrial-arms sector through technical and
manufacturing assistance. **[Grants started to replace loans in
1974]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. government shortly afterwards started
to permit Israel to spend 26% of the annual military grant on purchases
in Israel]{.underline}** -- a unique arrangement, since by U.S. law
recipient countries must spend all of their foreign military financing
in the U.S. According to Ajl, "**[[the Israeli military industry often
relies on U.S. technological inputs, and the U.S. forbids Israel from
manufacturing crucial heavy weaponry, such as fighter jets, in order to
maintain control over Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [U.**S. military
grants to Israel were often quid pro quo, as Israel increasingly took on
the work for which the U.S. could not publicly take responsibility,
given popular unease in the States over aid to fascist
dictatorships.**]{.underline} As the International Jewish Anti-Zionist
Network noted in their
[report](http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/israels-worldwide-role-in-repression-footnotes-finalized.pdf),
Israel's Worldwide Role in Repression, **[in the 1970s, Israel armed the
brutal military regime of the Argentinian junta]{.underline}** that
imposed seven years of state terrorism on the population. **[Israel also
provided most of the arms that Nicaraguan dictator]{.underline}**
Anastasio **["Tachito]{.underline}**" Somoza used in the last year of
his dictatorship to oppose the revolution, **[a conflict that killed
tens of thousands of Nicaraguans in the 1970s]{.underline}**. By the
2000s, **[[the Israeli military-industrial
complex]{.underline}]{.mark}** had produced an industry capable of
competing in small-arms and high-end security technology on a worldwide
scale. Israel **[[started to export arms that have been refined through
high-technology colonial policing of the Palestinian population]{.mark},
especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank]{.underline}**. In recent
years, Israel has risen to one of the [top 10 arms
exporters](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5174345,00.html)
in the world. Last May Haaretz
[reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-defense-export-sales-exceed-record-9-billion-1.6052046),
"Israel's defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an
all-time record and whooping 40% increase over 2016 -- when
defense-related transactions totaled \$6.5 billion." **[The Obama
administration adjustments to [Israel's military aid
package](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-statement/u-s-israel-sign-38-billion-military-aid-package-idUSKCN11K2CI)
came amidst a shifting geopolitical environment]{.underline}**, both
within the U.S. and Israel. There was **[[a shift in original
MOU]{.underline}]{.mark}** that would slowly phase out the provisions
through which Israel could spend up to 26% of its funding package within
Israel, to Israel spending more of this funding on the advanced military
capabilities that only the United States can provide -- as much as \$1.2
billion per year, according to Ajl. In addition, this MOU locked in
\$500 million annually for missile defense.The MOU **[[mandates Israel

[investment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-lands-23-billion-pentagon-contract-1542237634)

States.]{.underline}** **[Not only does U.S. foreign policy and

region.]{.underline}** The firm establishment of **[Israel's military
defense industry]{.underline}** also **[provides an excuse to sell
ever-more-sophisticated weapons to other regional U.S.

**[Israel thus is the spark plug for an entire region-wide weapons

suggests that **[one of reasons the United States pushed
throug]{.underline}**h this **[MOU before Obama left office is the
rising discontent within the U.S. population over ongoing support for
Israeli colonization]{.underline}** of historic **[Palestine and the
surrounding region]{.underline}**. Frida Berrigan, author of Made in the
U.S.A.: American Military Aid to Israel,
[writes](http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/feature/71588/focus%3A-u.s.-aid,-companies-fuel-israeli-military.html)
that a major barrier to any shift in American policy towards
Palestine-Israel is "financial pressures from a U.S military industrial
complex accustomed to billions of dollars in sales to Israel and other
Middle Eastern nations locked in a seemingly perpetual arms race with
each other by all buying American and using Foreign Military Financing
(FMF) to pay the bills." The United States is the primary source of
Israel's far superior arsenal. Israel's
[dependence](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2018/03/understanding-military-aid-israel-180305092533077.html)
on the U.S. for aid and arms means that the Israeli military relies on
spare parts and technical assistance from the U.S. to maintain optimum
performance in battle. **[During the Bush administration]{.underline}**,
**[from 2001 to 2005]{.underline}**, Israel had actually received more
in U.S. military aid than it has in U.S. arms deliveries. Over this time
period, **[[Israel received \$10.5 billion in FMF]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- the Pentagon's biggest military aid program -- **[[and \$6.3 billion
in U.S. arms deliveries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to Berrigan,
**[the most prominent of those deals was a \$4.5 billion sale of 102
Lockheed Martin F-16s to Israel.]{.underline}** Unlike other countries,
Israel [receives](https://www.mepc.org/node/4789) its Economic Support
Funds in one lump sum early in the fiscal year rather than in four
quarterly installments. While other countries primarily deal with the
Department of Defense when arranging to purchase military hardware from
U.S. companies, Israel deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast
majority of its military purchases in the United States. Other countries
have a \$100,000 minimum purchase amount per contract, but Israel is
allowed to purchase military items for far less, according to Berrigan.
**[Today, [Israel has been the beneficiary of approximately \$125
billion in U.S. aid]{.mark}]{.underline}**. An unimaginable sum, **[more
than any other country since World War II.]{.underline}** **[[U.S. aid
is projected to further increase to \$165 billion]{.mark} by the end of
the new 10-year package]{.underline}**, in 2029, according to [Charles
D.
Freilich](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential),
a former Israeli deputy national security adviser. **[U.S. aid
constitutes some 3% of Israel's total state budget and about 1% of its
GDP, a highly significant sum]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[U.S. aid
constitutes some 20% of the total defense budget, 40% of the budget of
the Israel Defense Forces, and almost the entire procurement
budg]{.underline}**et, according to Freilich. **[Israel's dependence on
the U.S. is not limited to financial aid and weapons
sales]{.underline}**. According to Freilich, **[the U.S. provides
technologies for the development of unique weapons systems that Israel
needs]{.underline}**, such as the Iron Dome and the Arrow rocket and
missile defense systems. It mans the radar deployed in Israel, which is
linked to the global American satellite system. Fredilich writes,
"**[There is simply no alternative to American weapons,
and]{.underline}** our **[dependence on the United States is almost
complete; the bitter truth is that without the United States, the IDF
would be an empty shell]{.underline}**." The United States is Israel's
largest trading partner, at least partially due to their [bilateral free
trade
agreement](https://thedefensepost.com/2019/04/08/libya-haftar-fighting-tripoli-africom-relocates-forces/),
the first the United States signed with any country. **[[The U.S.-Israel
special relationship is rooted in preferential arms trade agreements as
a way to]{.mark} subsidize the U.S. military industry and [reinforce
support for Israeli colonialism]{.mark}. This special relationship is
locked into an arms trade cycle where [both the Israeli and American
elite class benefits, at the expense of the indigenous
population]{.mark}. The [U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over
occupied territories provides a boost for Israeli colonialism]{.mark}.
We must ask ourselves, "If Trump has consented to Israeli illegal
seizure of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem, why not also the West
Bank?"]{.underline}** Prime Minister **[Netanyahu has

to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he is
re-elected,]{.underline}** which will likely be considered as the final
blow to the so called possibility of a two-state solution. The Trump
administration is expected to announce his ["ultimate
deal"](https://www.timesofisrael.com/snap-elections-may-put-trumps-peace-plan-on-back-burner-until-summer/)
following the Israeli elections and after a new government is formed.

follow suit **[and

Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, which will drive the final nail
into the coffin of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and
solidify Israeli apartheid.]{.underline}**

#### **[And, Israeli modeling of the United States has lead to the formation of an inescapable Israeli "matrix of control," dedicated to pacifying Palestinian natives and global critics until colonization has run its course]{.underline}**

**[Falk 4/7]{.underline}** -- Richard, international law and relations
scholar who taught at Princeton for over 40 years. "[Reading Jeff
Halper's 'War Against the People: Israel, the Palestinians and Global
Pacification,'](https://richardfalk.wordpress.com/2016/04/07/reading-jeff-halpers-war-against-the-people-israel-the-palestinians-and-global-pacification/)
<http://inthesetimes.com/features/israel-palestine-killings-us-aid-military-weapons.html>

This **[long experience of [coping with Palestinian resistance has given
Israel]{.mark} continuing [field experience with]{.mark} tactics and
[weapons]{.mark} [useful]{.mark} [to subdue a non-state
adversary]{.mark}, including convincing demonstrations of what works and
what doesn't. In fundamental respects [the work of pacification is never
finished, and]{.mark} so [Israel]{.mark} continuously [modifies its
weapons mix to take account of battlefield lessons]{.mark} and
technological innovations]{.underline}**, and this is of great value to
governments that were seeking to choose among several alternatives to
meet the requirements of their particular security challenges. **[Israel
can claim both the reliability of its weaponry through their field
testing in response to varying conditions and success in adapting to
ever changing tactics of Palestinian resistance]{.underline}**. No other
country has achieved this mastery over the hardware and software of a
pacification approach to internal security.

Halper also makes us aware that **[[pacification is what]{.mark} also
[best explains the hegemonic ambitions of America's securitizing
approach to world order]{.mark}. [What Israel has achieved on a small
scale, the United States is managing on a large
scale]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words the several hundred
American foreign military bases together with navies patrolling all of
the world's oceans, further reinforced by satellite militarization of
space for purposes of intelligence and possible attack are the coercive
infrastructure of both **[[neoliberal globalization]{.mark} and American
global leadership]{.underline}**. The objective is to **[[keep those
dissatisfied with this established order under sufficient
control]{.mark} [so]{.mark} that trade, investment, and basic [security
relations]{.mark} [are not]{.mark} deeply
[disturbed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Part of Halper's argument is that
**[Israel understands the dynamics of an effective regime of global
pacification better than any other country]{.underline}**, and has done
its best to be useful to the United States and Europe by providing niche
support in terms of weaponry (say for border barriers, surveillance, and
control) and doctrine (say targeted assassinations by drone strikes and
collective blockades).

Matrix of Control

Halper relies upon an illuminating style of conceptualization to develop
his basic analysis. For instance, one of his important contributions is
to specify global pacification by reference to a "Matrix of Control."
**[The basic argument of the book is that [the most defining "wars" of
our times involve using state violence against a mobilized
population]{.mark} that mounts threats against the established economic
and political order. [The matrix of control is the complex interaction
of weapons, policies, practices, and ideas that make this project a
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The paradigmatic case is the Israeli
pacification of the Palestinians, which is less than their defeat or
annihilation, but something other than sustained warfare; it is doing
enough by way of forcible action to punish, terrorize, and suppress
without clearly crossing the line drawn by legal prohibitions on mass
atrocity and genocide. It is damping down the fires of Palestinian
resistance into a smoldering mass of tensions and resentments that every
so often bursts into flames, offering pretexts for launching a new
campaign of devastation. **[The pattern of periodic onslaughts against
Gaza since 2008 is indicative of the broader policies, with three
massive attacks every 2-3 years, what Israeli officials are comfortable
describing as "mowing the lawn" (146), which incidentally stimulates a
new round of arms sales.]{.underline}**

**[[The Israeli matrix of control]{.underline}]{.mark}** (143-190)
**[[is specified by reference to its]{.mark} various [main components,
forming]{.mark} an integrated and distinctive form of]{.underline}**
what Halper describes as "**[[urban warfare]{.mark}" [resting on the
premise of "domestic securitization]{.mark}," that [is]{.mark},
[conceiving]{.mark} of [the enemy as]{.mark} mainly [operating within
the]{.mark} boundaries of the [state]{.mark}, ultimately to be contained
rather than defeated]{.underline}**. **[Such an integrated approach
relies on walls to keep the unwanted from entering, surveillance,
fragmenting the population to be controlled, periodic and punitive
violent suppression designed to prevent, preempt, and demoralize, and
proactive intelligence that seeks to gain access to the inner circles of
militant opposition forces]{.underline}**. **[[Such a matrix of control
both deploys a mixture of traditional counterterrorist measures and the
latest innovations in sophisticated technology]{.mark}, including armed
robotics, drones, and a variety of overlapping surveillance
techniques]{.underline}**. **[The approach relies on a vertical layering
of security measures that rests on redundancy to ensure effective
control.]{.underline}** **[What is original about this approach is its
conscious realization that "victory" over hostile subjugated forces is
not an acceptable or realizable policy option, and what works best is a
system of permanent control sustained by a mix of coercive and
psychological instruments.]{.underline}**

#### U.S. Israeli military affiliations are the primary barrier to Israeli-Palestinian peace

Peace in the Middle East,\" Nation,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/washingtons-military-aid-israel/>) AT

[Today, Secretary of State John Kerry is leading a push for a renewed
round of the interminable [American-led peace process in the
region]{.mark} that has been underway since the mid-1970s. It's hardly a
bold prediction to suggest that this round, too, [will
fail]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Israeli minister of defense, Moshe
Ya'alon, has already publicly
[mocked](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.568868) Kerry in his quest for
peace as "obsessive and messianic" and added that [[the]{.mark} newly
[proposed]{.mark} framework for this round of [negotiations]{.mark} is
"[not worth the paper it's printed on]{.mark}." Other [Israeli high
officials blasted Kerry for his]{.mark} mere [mention of the]{.mark}
potential negative [consequences to Israel of a global boycott if peace
is not achieved]{.mark}]{.underline}. But why shouldn't Ya'alon and
other Israeli officials tee off on the hapless Kerry? [After all, [the
defense minister knows that Washington will wield no stick]{.mark} and
that bushels of carrots are in the offing, whether Israel rolls back or
redoubles its land seizures and colonization efforts]{.underline}.
President Obama has boasted that the US has never given so much military
aid to Israel as under his presidency. On January 29, the House Foreign
Affairs Committee
[voted](http://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/press-release/us-%20percentE2%20percent80%20percent93-israel-strategic-partnership-bill-unanimously-passed-house-foreign-affairs)
unanimously to upgrade Israel's status to "major strategic partner."
[[With Congress and the president guaranteeing that unprecedented levels
of military aid will continue to flow, Israel has no]{.mark} real
[incentive to change its behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Usually such
diplomatic impasses are blamed on the Palestinians, but given how little
is left to squeeze out of them, doing so this time will test the
creativity of official Washington. [Whatever happens, in the
post-mortems to come there will be no discussion in Washington about the
role its own policies played in undermining a just and lasting
agreement]{.underline}. How much longer will this silence last? [[The
arming and bankrolling of a wealthy nation committing ethnic cleansing
has something to offend]{.mark} conservatives, progressives and just
about [every]{.mark} other [political grouping in America]{.mark}. After
all, [how often in foreign policy does strategic self-interest
align]{.mark} so neatly [with human rights]{.mark} and common
decency]{.underline}? Intelligent people can and do disagree about a
one-state versus a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. People
of goodwill disagree about the global BDS campaign. But [it is hard to
imagine what kind of progress can ever be made toward a just and lasting
settlement between Israel and Palestine until Washington quits arming
one side to the teeth]{.underline}. ["[If it weren't for US support for
Israel, this conflict would have been resolved a long time
ago]{.mark},"]{.underline} says Josh Ruebner. Will we Americans ever
acknowledge our government's active role in destroying the chances for a
just and lasting peace between Palestine and Israel?

comes amid reports that **[the Pentagon has approved the immediate

a US stockpile pre-positioned in Israel, and]{.underline}** follows **[a
shipment of 4.3 tons of US-manufactured rocket motors, which arrived in
the Israeli port of Haifa on 15 July. These deliveries add to more than
US\$62 million worth of munitions]{.underline}** - including guided
missile parts and rocket launchers, artillery parts and small arms -
already exported from the USA to Israel between January and May this
year. Shipments included nearly \$27million for "rocket launchers",
\$9.3 million of "parts of guided missiles" and nearly \$762,000 for
"bombs, grenades and munitions of war". The USA is by far the world's
largest exporter of military equipment to Israel. Since 2012, it has
exported \$276 million worth of basic weapons and munitions, a figure
that excludes exports of military transport equipment and high
technologies (see the table at <http://bit.ly/UE089K>). The news on 30
July that **[the USA had allowed [the resupply of munitions to Israel
came the same day the US government condemned the shelling of a UN
school in Gaza]{.mark} which killed at least 20 people]{.underline}**,
including children and UN humanitarian workers. Brian Wood, Head of Arms
Control and Human Rights at Amnesty International, said: "**[It is
deeply cynical for the White House to condemn the deaths and injuries of
Palestinians]{.underline}**, including children, and humanitarian
workers, when [i**[t knows full well that the Israeli military

displaying a callous disregard for lives being lost in the conflict on
all sides." **[Amnesty is calling on the UN to immediately impose a

### Framework

#### Solidarity as a movement is key to decolonization- only a radical reframing of politics can solve 

**Tabar & Desai 17** (Linda Tabar is a Visiting Assistant Professor in
International Studies at Trinity College. Situated in the field of
anti-colonial, anti-racist feminist scholarship, her work focuses on
settler colonialism. Dr. Chandni Desai is an Assistant Professor in the
Equity Studies Program at the University of Toronto.)

Complicating solidarity, Elia shows that whiteness and the hegemony of
the Zionist narrative in the west mediate relations between feminists
across the Americas to Palestine which obstruct the formation of genuine
feminist alliances. She interrogates the way **[white liberal feminists
impose a micro-level analysis of the sexism and gender violence
experienced by Palestinian women that disconnects these realities from
the macro-level of settler colonialism, militarism and racism.
S]{.underline}**he argues that these **[liberal feminists adopt a white
savior complex to "save" their less fortunate sisters and perceive
Palestinian women as trapped by 'backward traditions' and 'Islamic
fundamentalism.]{.underline}**' **[This is linked to the specificities
of Palestine and the way that progressives in the west continue to
identify with Israel and therefore shield the settler colonial state
from criticism]{.underline}**. Her contribution puts forward an analysis
of solidarity that is not parallel but intersectional through which
feminists can come "together at various nodes" where solidarity is
reciprocal as "a long-term movement, not a **[moment". She challenges
global north feminists (including women of colour) to enact solidarity
with Palestine that furthers a [decolonial praxis]{.mark}, which [is
only possible if that solidarity is committed to ending]{.mark} Zionist
[settler colonialism]{.mark}. We recognize that while solidarity can
become a problematic site for the re-enactment of racist, colonial power
relations that are invested in normative subjectivities and notions of
superiority, it [is]{.mark} still [necessary to build a decolonial
solidarity across difference, that centers the voices and demands of the
oppressed and builds ethical relations of accountability]{.mark} to
these communities and defers to the leadership of their respective
movements.]{.underline}** Also in a time when identity politics are
deployed in ways that obscures a structural analysis of power, Kelley
(2016) reminds us that "**[[solidarity ought to be understood as a
political project]{.mark}]{.underline}** rather than some kind of
natural alliance. Solidarity is a political stance, not a racial
imperative" (Para 3). Our contributors theorize and enact modes of
solidarity that are internationalist in their political practices and
their understandings of the global formations of power. Because of the
intrinsic interlocking ways that land dispossession, capitalist
accumulation and systemic violence are linked globally, Jamal Juma'
suggests it is necessary to "unify our struggles**[" and go beyond
solidarity by ["working towards a joint global struggle for people's
rights of Palestinians]{.mark}, Africans, Latin Americans, Asians and
Indigenous people worldwide." This suggests that [solidarity goes beyond
tactical alliances and transactional exchanges between movements and
should entail a deeper formidable process of global transformation in
imagining and making a better world]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
unification of struggles that Juma' is calling for in the present, has
long been considered dangerous by those in power. As Delgado and Childs
note, as "long as Native Americans and African Americans were in
proximity they constituted a dreaded threat of anti- colonial alliance"
(2005, p. 77). Our special issue mobilizes a global memory in which
different forms of internationalism, specifically with Palestine (which
have posed a threat to systems of power), have enabled us to interpret
and connect the different ways state violence, settler sovereignty,
racial capitalism work together, while at the same time, rupturing how
these ideologies separate and divide oppressed peoples of the world.
Moreover, this special issue utilizes this global memory of past and
present connections, to **[theorize and [think about decolonization in a
global context]{.mark}. In many ways, solidarity encapsulates the
various themes this special issue puts forward. As Johanna Fernandez
notes, "[solidarity promises to enlarge our global vision, foster
communal values and restore our humanity]{.mark}." [Solidarity is a
space where ethical relationships and strategic political alliances can
be built; colonial and capitalists structures]{.mark} and categories
[can be contested; and different modes of radical thought and
relationships can be envisioned and enacte]{.mark}d. Solidarity,
therefore, is not only a terrain in which movements can stand together
and take risks in opposing power, but also a transformative process that
can prefigure a different world.]{.underline}** As Neferti Tadiar
suggests, "to be involved in the struggle of Palestinians is to resist
and transform the conditions of their own dispossession and
disposability\...and also participate in the remaking of global life"
(2012, para 4). This is precisely because colonial, capitalist and
imperialist systems and apparatuses conjoin in producing and reinforcing
dispossession and disposability of lives all over the world. It is these
complexities and performative processes that our contributors theorize
and discuss. By centering Palestine they broaden intellectual, political
debates and activism from which Palestine has often b een left out of,
expanding ways of thinking about anti- colonial thought and processes
from the Americas to Palestine and the rest of the Third World.

#### Advocacy for solidarity reproduces important epistemological framing of settler-colonialism in Palestine. Breaking down these barriers through analytical policy discussion is the first step towards destroying ancient colonial structures and ending the oppression of Palestinians.

**[a sophisticated matrix of [apartheid policies]{.mark} against
Palestinians everywhere, not just in the territories occupied in
1967]{.underline}**... At the American Studies Association Conference in
Autumn 2015, a panel took stock of settler colonialism as an emerging
field of academic study.[\[1\]](https://www.jadaliyya.com/%22#_ftn1\%22)
Panelists and audience members raised many pertinent issues, including
the distinction between settler colonialism as an analytic and as a
political discourse. Panelists and audience members spoke of the ways in
**[which as an analytic, settler colonialism is being constructed into a
new legible field of study within Western academe and described how the
constitution of a field in this sense is at the same moment a boundary
drawing exercise]{.underline}**. The results, inevitably, are
exclusions. What is identified as "settler colonial" scholarship and
what is left out? Several participants commented about the politics of
producing knowledge in this emergent field. A politics of citation is
developing that reinscribes different forms of gender-race privilege. It
often marginalizes scholars who have been writing about the effects of
settler colonialism for decades, but perhaps not using the analytic of
settler colonialism to describe the colonization and occupation of their
land. One can glimpse a similar form of intellectual amnesia in the
contemporary resurgence of work on "intersectionality." Such writing
often omits reference to the [decades of feminist
scholarship](http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/aguilar120412.html/)
that addressed the same themes using different conceptual tools. At
issue are not the specific authors that are often cited in more recent
scholarship on settler-colonialism within Palestine Studies (for
example, Patrick Wolfe or Lorenzo Veracini), rather it is the loss of
the rich scholarship by Indigenous scholars which does not fit neatly
into scholarly boundaries. In the context of using the settler colonial
paradigm to analyze and understand the occupation of Palestine, these
concerns have a particular resonance. In some instances, recent
discussions of Israel as a settler colony tend to ignore the rich
historical scholarship on the colonization of Palestine and reference
only the most recent accounts. Indeed, **[early Zionists from the late
nineteenth century onwards were explicit about characterizing their
endeavors in Palestine as settler colonial in form and substance. [The
strength of using a settler-colonial framework in Palestine Studies, is
precisely its ability to historicize the colonization of Palestine as a
process]{.mark}]{.underline}** that began long before the 1948 Nakba.
Such historicization can account for and build upon the earlier
scholarship of, for example, [Maxime Rodinson

assert that **[the settler colonial paradigm has largely fallen into
disuse in Palestine studies in the wake of the Oslo accords. This both
reflects and exacerbates a tendency towards a "piecemeal approach to the
establishment of some kind of sovereignty under the structure of the
Israeli settler colonial regime."]{.underline}** In turn, they set out
an optimistic agenda that centers on the promise of a revivified
engagement with the settler colonial analytic for Palestine studies,
politically and intellectually (Salamanca, Qato, Rabie and Samour,
2012). To their credit they point in the introduction to **[the long
history of scholarship that analyzed Israel as a settler colonial
project.]{.underline}** We share their view that **[[the settler
colonial analytic is an essential lens]{.mark} [to understand]{.mark}
the myriad forms of [dispossession experienced by
Palestinians]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the late nineteenth century.
However, despite these efforts, several of the Palestine focused
academic conferences and discussions we have attended over the past five
years in the United Kingdom and Palestine, have reinforced certain myths
about the realities of settler colonialism in Canada, Australia, the
United States and elsewhere, establishing a temporal distinction that
posits settler colonialism in Canada, for example, as something that
happened to First Nations, and continues to happen in Palestine. Thereby
presenting Israel as the exceptional and "unfinished" settler colonial
project. That somehow their "past" is Palestine's "present." **[We argue
that a "comparative" approach must attend to the political-economic and
juridical formations that subtend colonization as a process and benefit
from the nuanced scholarship on the realities of settler
colonialism]{.underline}** in Canada, the United States, Australia, and
for that matter, Palestine by Indigenous scholar-activists. Taking up
the settler colonial analytic in a 'comparative' perspective: academic
practice and political praxis **[The clearest scholarship on Israel's
status as a settler colony, when placed in a comparative perspective,
should draw on detailed analysis of the history and ongoing
colonization]{.underline}** of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the
United States. Informed scholarship can thus challenge the colonial
trope of the "dead Indian" or the notion that First Nations were for the
most part eliminated, along with, presumably, their cultural practices,
legal systems, languages, and forms of self-governance...
**[Beyond]{.underline}** delegations to Palestine which have generated
**[very important discussions among academic-activists over the last few
years]{.underline}**, **[[political practices that create meaningful
forms of solidarity often go unexplored in academic settings]{.mark}.
But developing a settler colonial analytic ought not to be merely an
academic comparative exercise]{.underline}**. The misunderstanding of
current realities and struggles across settler colonial contexts and the
internalization of the discourse of the "defeated Indian" hinders
solidarity between Palestinians and other Indigenous communities. As the
above quote from Mahmoud Darwish highlights, Columbus "is carrying out
his deadly war even from the grave." Settler colonial projects function
precisely by erasing the struggles of Indigenous peoples, by pronouncing
their defeat as they are continuing to resist colonialism. Some
Palestine scholars continue to insist on the exceptionalism of Israel as
the only "unfinished" settler colonial project, and some activists
proclaim Palestine the "last colonial occupation." However, Indigenous
communities in other settler colonial contexts continue to assert their
rights in myriad ways, and continue to be subject to the violent and
brutal mechanisms of settler colonialism, including struggling for
sovereignty over their lands. In Canada, **[Palestinian and Palestine
solidarity activists tried to build solidarity with Indigenous
communities and activists]{.underline}**. On 28 February 2006, the Six
Nations of the Grand River community engaged in a land reclamation near
Caledonia, Ontario. **[The Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid (CAIA),
an umbrella organization of Palestine solidarity groups]{.underline}**
based in Toronto and other Palestine solidarity organizations from
across Ontario, supported the Six Nations of the Grand River. CAIA
**[raised funds for the reclamation, cooked meals for those on the
blockade, organized support delegations to the site, and engaged their
contacts in the trade union movement for support]{.underline}**. Within
the first week, and at the request of the community, a Palestinian flag
was flying at the reclamation site. **[During various Israeli Apartheid
Week events, organizers invited Indigenous speakers to speak on their
struggles. Palestinian delegations]{.underline}** visiting Canada on
speaking tours went to the reclamation site and met with Indigenous
activists. They had open discussions about the Apartheid Wall in
Palestine, the similarities of land encroachment mechanisms, the role of
the prison system in both places and importantly the impact of cultural
oppression on children in Indigenous communities and in Palestine.
**[[This organizing was an intentional attempt to go beyond]{.mark} the
[mainstream focus on "big actions" by Indigenous communities, to foster
an understanding of the daily resistance practices within
communities]{.mark} that include creative elements of cultural
preservation...]{.underline}** There was hesitation on the part of
Palestinian community organizations (some funded by the Canadian state)
to openly support Indigenous land reclamations for fear of government
reprisal. This fear was not unfounded. The Canadian state often targeted
Palestinian community organizations by slashing their funding and
through police intimidation of leading activists. In practice, joint
organizing and public support was not a given -- activists who fought
for it cultivated this form of joint struggle. They had witnessed how
the settler colonial project is perpetuated by segregating Indigenous
communities and marginalized migrant communities from one another. It is
crucial we counter this segregation by rejecting the idea that
Indigenous struggles are a thing of the past, by seriously studying
multiple settler colonial contexts and forging solidarity with First
Nations and Indigenous communities. It is Indigenous and women of color
activists who are patiently and persistently doing this work. Between
the language of indigeneity and nativity? The politics of using the
settler colonial analytic in the legal realm The language of
indigeneity, as explored above, has important political currency in
creating meaningful solidarity movements. The recent deployment of
indigeneity in the legal realm raises a host of political challenges for
the "comparative settler colonial" studies approach. At a recent
presentation in London, Adalah lawyer Suhad Bishara spoke cogently and
critically of attempts to use the Indigenous rights paradigm as the
basis for Bedouin land claims in the Naqab. She pointed out that the
legal definition of Indigenous people (as established in the UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) and the concept of
Aboriginal title (as established in caselaw such as [Mabo v Queensland
(No.2) \[1992\] HCA
23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr1.html?stem=0&synonyms=0&query=~mabo\)),
might ultimately reinforce a fragmentation of Palestinian political
identity. The claim for the legal recognition of Indigenous rights may
not be appropriate for Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip,
Jerusalem or elsewhere. Other settler jurisdictions have acknowledged
Indigenous rights to land in the form of Aboriginal title (in Canada and
Australia, and in the post-colonial context India, and in the
post-apartheid context, South
Africa).[\[2\]](https://www.jadaliyya.com/%22#_ftn2\%22) It may thus be
tempting to set Israel apart from these examples since that is not the
case there. In recent adjudication, the Israeli Supreme Court [refused
to acknowledge any Bedouin ownership
interests](http://972mag.com/israel-supreme-court-bedouin-have-no-indigenous-rights/107171/)
over their land, or for that matter, the fact that the claimants have a
long historical and contemporary presence on the land that at a minimum
warrants their consideration. While it is true in a prima facie sense,
that settler colonial states such Canada and Australia have recognized
Indigenous rights to land and resources whereas Israeli courts have
refused any such acknowledgments, the conclusion that Israel is
exceptional in its steadfast denial of Palestinian land rights ignores
the cunning of recognition evident in this growing jurisprudence of
aboriginal rights. It has developed on the basis of denying First
Nations' sovereignty and reaffirming Crown (colonial) sovereignty. In
the Australian context, this amounts to recognizing the "radical
underlying title" of the Crown. The "jurisprudence of regret" that
characterized the Australian High Court's decision in Mabohas developed
into a "regrettable jurisprudence" as [Alex
Reilly](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MurUEJL/2002/50.html/)
argues, with the political potential of native title increasingly
limited by subsequent judgments. It took many decades of litigation and
political struggle in Canada before advocates achieved an actual
declaration of Aboriginal title. Consider that only in 2014, was the
[Tsilhqot'in First
Nation](http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14246/index.do/)
in British Columbia recognized as holding Aboriginal title to a portion
of their traditional territory While not diminishing this important
political and legal victory, it should be noted that the Canadian
Supreme Court recognized that titled based on forms of [customary land
use](https://www.academia.edu/17273825/Critical_Legal_Studies_and_The_Politics_of_Property/)
within the world of the somewhat suspect anthropological category of the
'semi-nomad'. That is to say, even when recognizing forms of land use
that exceed the boundaries of Anglo-Canadian concepts of property, it
takes place on the basis of a western anthropological discourse of
nomadism. Perhaps the category of the "native" as Fanon, Césaire, and
other anti-colonial writers critically deployed, avoids the strictures
and weight of the juridical language of indigeneity. It could be that
using the dichotomy of the colonizer/colonized is more closely attuned
to histories of political solidarity between the Palestinian Liberation
Organisation (PLO), the National Iberation Front -- Algeria (FLN) and
and the African National Congress (ANC). Yet perhaps the similarities in
colonial techniques of dispossession between Australia, Canada, and
Israel/Palestine render the language of indigeneity potentially useful
as a political language in which to articulate resistance. Patricia
Monture-Angus, a renowned Indigenous scholar and activist, preferred to
use the name of the Nation she belonged to, the Mohawk First Nation, to
describe herself. She believed that the terms "native," "Aboriginal "
and "Indigenous" were all colonial impositions. In any case, Bishara
seemed to be rejecting the use of the language of indigeneity, more than
anything else, on the same political basis that Monture-Angus, and some
Bedouin, and some First Nations in Canada, have rejected the need for
colonial recognition of their rights to their land. It is their land and
the recognition of a settler legal and political system of their
"Indigenous" title and rights has no bearing on this fact. Settler
Colonialism and Racial Capitalism **[The forging of a new academic field
of settler colonial studies risks potentially creating unnecessary
binaries between studies of colonialism and settler-colonialism. It is
clear that techniques of colonial dispossession traveled throughout
networks of trade and leisure established during and throughout the
British Empire. Such tools include the surveillance and criminalization
of colonized populations, land appropriation, resource extraction, the
perversion or indeed, attempted erasure, of native legal systems, and
control over the mobility and political citizenship of colonized
populations]{.underline}**. English colonial administrators and
freelance entrepreneurs traveled, during the nineteenth century, between
the Indian subcontinent, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Caribbean,
the United States, the African continent, and of course the United
Kingdom. They imported and exported the legal and political
infrastructures required for colonial modes of expropriation. **[With
the advent of the Mandate system, Palestine became another scene of
exchange and implementation of European colonial modes of governance

the settler colonial analytic is that between the colonizer and
colonized.]{.underline}** While **[adopting a settler colonial framework
is critical to analyzing Israel's modus operandi as a colonial power,

amongst Palestinians]{.underline}**. Ella Shohat's [critical
work](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118475683.ch16/summary/)
on the racial hierarchy within Israel's settler society is a strong
example that highlights the historical marginalization of the Mizrahim,
Jews of Arab origin. Racialized immigrants occupy both the position of
settler in relation to Indigenous communities and the subaltern in
relation to the dominant place of the white European settler. Some
scholars in North America, and particularly in
[Hawai'i](http://www.amazon.com/Asian-Settler-Colonialism-Governance-Everyday/dp/0824830156/)
have grasped how **[the racialization of particular immigrant
communities in settler states complicates the settler colonial
framework]{.underline}**. On the other hand, a settler colonial
framework must also contend with the emerging class differences in
Palestinian society exacerbated by the impact of the Oslo Accords. This
is especially relevant when contending with the question of how
Palestinians can challenge the logic of the Oslo process while the
Palestinian Authority, adhering to a fundamental neoliberal agenda
([Hanieh 2013](http://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/Lineages-of-Revolt/)),
remains intact. The Palestinian Authority continues to formulate
Palestinian liberation in terms of truncated statehood on small sections
of Palestinian land and celebrates symbolic acts such as raising the
Palestinian flag at the United Nations while prospects of Palestinian
sovereignty over land continue to diminish daily. Sadly, the PA's focus
continues to be building a neoliberal state apparatus as a way to
"convince" Israel and international donors that Palestinians are able to
run their affairs. For all intents and purposes, **[Israel has succeeded
in outsourcing its military occupation to a segment of Palestinians -
this is evident in the relatively large budgets of the security forces
of the PA and the continued security coordination with Israel. In our
view, such differences within both the settler society and the colonized
need to be brought out and fully incorporated into the settler colonial
analytical framework. Racially inscribed dispossession and the
capitalist modes of accumulation that subtend expropriative practices
have developed in spatially and temporally differentiated ways in the
colonies, as elaborated by scores of post-colonial theorists. In other
words, capitalist development in the colonies has not mirrored the
transition from feudal economies to capitalist ones in
Europe]{.underline}**. The terms "postcolonial capitalism" and "racial
capitalism" both denote ways of understanding capitalist forms of
dispossession that profit from, and reinforce class hierarchies,
patriarchal formations, and racist ideologies lodged in colonial
imaginaries that persist into the present. These terms do not neatly fit
into a settler-colonial framework and yet are critical to understanding
the political-economic, juridical and social complexities across various
sites of inquiry. **[Forcing them into a single analytical category
risks losing this richness and undermining forms of political solidarity
across colonized spaces.]{.underline}** Darwish's masterful poem, ["The
Red Indian's Penultimate Speech to the White
Man"](http://harvardreview.fas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/private/36_Darwish_Joudah.pdf/)
begins with an epigram from the Duwamish Chief Seattle. The
dispossession of native land that Columbus' ill-fated voyage
inaugurated, binds together the fates of Native Americans and
Palestinians, who resist colonial dominance over land, time, history,
memory, and place. As Chief Seattle asserts, "there is no Death here,
there is only the change of worlds." We in turn are looking for our own
counter-narration, a language to explain the ongoing violence of
dispossession in multiple contexts. We are reminded of the words of
[Mike Krebs and Dana
Olwan](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2201473X.2012.10648846/):
**[[We want to build solidarity without reproducing and enacting the
same colonial logics]{.mark} and asymmetric relationships of power on
which settler colonialisms hinge. We believe that our futures are
connected and that [we are especially powerful when we enact
solidarity]{.mark} by words and actions. To expect solidarity, we must
be willing to give it, share it, and maintain it. To do otherwise is to
risk producing solidarity on the very colonial terms that our movements
seek to challenge and undo.]{.underline}** If this sounds easy and
obvious, then my writing has failed you. Listen: you will need to
remember this when you are accused of destruction. **[[Attach a
pacemaker to the heart of those machines you hate; make it pump for your
decolonizing enterprise; let it tick its own countdown. Ask how, and how
otherwise, of the colonizing machines. Even when they are
dangerous]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### And these Incursions and Interventions in current epistemology needs to remain ongoing -- starting with the debate space is key to solvency

[**Medina 11**(José Medina, October 2011, professor of philosophy at

But how can ‚a white epistemology of ignorance‛ be destabilized and
resisted? There is no untainted standpoint of absolute epistemic
innocence from which white ignorance and its companion epistemological
principles of cognitive interaction can be subverted. But there are
always **[multiple points of resistance, multiple possible struggles to
initiate or continue from interested and biased standpoints with their
own forms of racial lucidity and racial blindness grounded in their own
power/ knowledge-ignorance structures.]{.underline}** What the guerrilla
pluralism of the Foucaultian ge- nealogical method can help produce is
not complete epistemic liberation (as Mills and other epistemologists of
race often seem to want), but rather, only **[[pointed critical]{.mark}
incursions and [interventions in epistemic economies,]{.mark} that is,
epistemic insurrections that [have to be constantly renewed and
remain]{.mark} always [ongoing]{.mark} in order [to keep producing
epistemic friction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Insurrectionary
genealogies]{.underline}**, understood in the way I have sketched in
this essay as grounded in a guerrilla pluralism, **[are invaluable
critical tools for denouncing the epistemic exclusions and
stigmatizations that sustain white privilege and white
ignorance.]{.underline}** In this sense, Foucaultian genea- logy
qualifies as the kind of critical theory that Linda Alcoff argues is
needed in contemporary epistemology of ignorance. In ‚Epistemologies of
Ignorance,‛ (2007) following Max Horkheimer, Alcoff **[characterizes
white ignorance as a ‚loss of critical rationality‛ characterized by
‚the atrophied ability to resist or critique]{.underline}**.‛77 If ‚the
project of critical theory‛ is, as Alcoff puts it, ‚to bring to
consciousness the link between the social production of knowledge and
the social production of society,‛78 Foucault can certainly be recruited
to participate in that project and to extend it to cover the social
production of ignorance and its power/knowledge effects. But Foucault
has something more radical to offer than Horkheimer or Mills: an
epistemological insurrection[. **[A critical epistemology of
ignorance]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[informed by a Foucaultian guerrilla
pluralism [can achieve a kind of epistemological insurrection that goes
beyond]{.mark} a [mere inversion of white epistemology,]{.mark} that is,
beyond an epistemology of the victims.]{.underline}** Mills has argued
that since **[white ignorance has produced an inverted epistemology that
protects it (i.e. a white epistemology]{.underline}**), the critical
task is to re- invert the inverted epistemology of the privileged into
an epistemology of the op- pressed. But is this enough? Alison Bailey
(2007) has argued that re-inversion stra- tegies do not work because
they reinscribe the logic of purity, failing to acceptduplicities,
multiplicities, and, in short, the complexities of our epistemic lives.
As she puts it: Re-inversion strategies are the only solutions purity
has to offer. However, I do not think re-inverting inverted
epistemologies will have radical long-standing effects. Under purity,
inverted epistemologies can only be re-inverted and not shat- tered.79
Drawing on María Lugones (2003),80 Bailey **[urges us to abandon the
logic of purity and to shift to a curdled logic that can accommodate
radical differences and the multiplicitous nature of our subjectivities.
[This curdled logic brings ignorance and epistemic oppression under a
different light]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} it [opens up new possibilities of
resistance]{.mark} and critique: ‚a curdled reading of ignorance will
offer us a more relational understanding of ignorance by revealing the
ways in which people of color have strategically engaged with white
folks' ignorance in ways that are ad- vantageous.]{.underline}**‛81 As
Bailey puts it, curdled resisting subjects are those who ‚take hold of
the double meaning of their actions‛82 and navigate ‚a world where both
dominant and resistant logics are present.‛83 Curdling is a way of
keeping alive the duplicities and multiplicities of our practices and of
ourselves, finding opportunities for resistance within them. This
curdling is very congenial with the guerrilla plu- ralism I have
described as animating insurrectionary genealogies. The **[forms of
epis- temological resistance that insurrectionary genealogies can offer
go well beyond a mere re-inversion of epistemic
relations]{.underline}**. But this should be taken as an extension of
---or even simply as a friendly amendment to---the critical project of
the episte- mology of ignorance that Mills has formulated for us. Bailey
herself seems to recognize this when she writes: ‚If we examine Mills's
'epistemology of victims' through a curdled lens we see that it also
includes an epistemology of resistance.‛84 And, as I have argued,
Foucault offers the theoretical resources for an epistemology of
resistance that goes beyond a mere re-inversion of relations of
epistemic sub- ordination and is capable of producing more complex
epistemic subversions--- perhaps even the shattering of epistemic
economies---through insurrections of sub- jugated knowledges. This
**[insurrectionary epistemology of resistance and the guer-rilla
pluralism in which it is grounded are the central contributions that
Foucaultian genealogy can make to contemporary epistemologies of
ignorance]{.underline}**.85

#### Operating within a utilitarian framework reinforces oppression and systematic destruction of the indigenous, creating an idea of necessity. Reject global war, nuclear holocaust, climate destruction impacts etc. because they model settler fear of decolonization through the excuse of "extinction."

Author of "The deaths of settler colonialism: extinction as a metaphor
of decolonization in contemporary settler literature," a journal article
on a post-colonial world and the psycho-analytics of settler
"extinction"

**[[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their own
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**; to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come. This tendency is widely
prevalent in English-language representations of settler colonialism
produced since the 1980s**[: the possibility of an ending -- the
likelihood that the settler race will one day die out -- is a common
theme]{.underline}** in literary and pop culture considerations of
colonialism's future. **[Yet it has barely been remarked how surprising
it is that this theme is so present]{.underline}**. **[F[or settlers, of
all people, to obsessively ruminate on their own finitude is
counterintuitive]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for **[[few modern social
formations have been more resistant to change than settler
colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** With a few exceptions (French
Algeria being the largest), the settler societies established in the
last 300 years in the Americas, Australasia, and Southern Africa have
all retained the basic features that define them as settler states --
namely, the structural privileging of settlers at the expense of
indigenous peoples, and the normalization of whiteness as the marker of
political agency and rights -- and they have done so notwithstanding the
sustained resistance that has been mounted whenever such an order has
been built. **[Settlers think all the time that they might one day end,
even though (perhaps because) that ending seems unlikely ever to
happen.]{.underline}** The significance of this paradox for
settler-colonial literature is the subject of this article.
**[[Considering the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to
traditional analyses of settlercolonial narrative]{.mark}, which
typically examine settlers' attitudes towards history in order to
highlight a constitutive anxiety about the past -- about origins.
Settler colonialism, the argument goes, has a problem with historical
narration that arises from a contradiction in its founding
mythology]{.underline}**. In Stephen Turner's formulation, the settler
subject is by definition one who comes from elsewhere but who strives to
make this place home. The settlement narrative must explain how this gap
-- which is at once geographical, historical, and existential -- has
been bridged, and the settler transformed from outsider into indigene.
Yet the transformation must remain constitutively incomplete, because
the desire to be at home necessarily invokes the spectre of the native,
whose existence (which cannot be disavowed completely because it is
needed to define the settler's difference, superiority, and hence claim
to the land) inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating the
gap between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to efface.1
**[[Settler-colonial narrative is thus shaped around its need to erase
and evoke the native, to make the indigene both invisible and present in
a contradictory pattern that prevents settlers from ever moving on from
the moment of colonization]{.mark}.]{.underline}**2 As evidence of this
constitutive contradiction, critics have identified in settler-colonial
discourse symptoms of psychic distress such as disavowal, inversion, and
repression.3 Indeed, the frozen temporality of settler-colonial
narrative, fixated on the moment of the frontier, recalls nothing so
much as Freud's description of the 'repetition compulsion' attending
trauma.4 As Lorenzo Veracini puts it, **[because: 'settler society' can
thus be seen as a fantasy where a perception of a constant struggle is
juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can never be reached,
settler projects embrace and reject violence at the same
time]{.underline}**. The settler colonial situation is thus a
circumstance where the tension between contradictory impulses produces
long-lasting psychic conflicts and a number of associated
psychopathologies.5 Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on
settler-colonial narrative's view of the past, asking how such a
contradictory and troubled relationship to history might affect
present-day ideological formations**[. [Critics have rarely considered
what such narratological tensions might produce when the settler gaze is
turned to the future]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Few social formations
are more stubbornly resistant to change than settlement, suggesting that
a future beyond settler colonialism might be simply
unthinkable]{.underline}**. Veracini, indeed, suggests that
**[[settler-colonial narrative can never contemplate an ending: that
settler decolonization is inconceivable because settlers lack the
metaphorical tools to imagine their own demise]{.underline}]{.mark}**.6
This article outlines why I partly disagree with that view. I argue that
the narratological paradox that defines settler-colonial narrative does
make the future a problematic object of contemplation. But that does not
make settler decolonization unthinkable per se; as I will show, settlers
do often try to imagine their demise -- but they do so in a way that
reasserts the paradoxes of their founding ideology, with the result that
the radical potentiality of decolonization is undone even as it is
invoked. I argue that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis, **[there is
a metaphor via which the end of settler colonialism unspools -- [the
quasi-biological concept of extinction, which, when deployed as a
narrative trope, offers settlers a chance to consider and disavow their
demise, just as they consider and then disavow the violence of their
origins]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This article traces the importance of
**[the trope of extinction for contemporary settler-colonial
literature,]{.underline}** with a focus on South Africa, Canada, and
Australia. **[It explores variations in how the death of settler
colonialism is conceptualized, drawing a distinction between
historio-civilizational narratives of the rise and fall of empires, and
a species-oriented notion of extinction that draws force from public
anxiety]{.underline}** about climate change -- an invocation that adds
another level of ambivalence by drawing on 'rational' fears for the
future (because climate change may well render the planet uninhabitable
to humans) in order to narrativize a form of social death that, strictly
speaking, belongs to a different order of knowledge altogether. As such,
my **[[analysis is intended to draw the attention of settlercolonial
studies toward futurity and the ambivalence of settler
paranoia]{.mark},]{.underline}** while highlighting a potential point of
cross-fertilization between settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches
to contemporary literature. That 'extinction' should be a key word in
the settler-colonial lexicon is no surprise. In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7
**[settler colonialism is predicated on a 'logic of elimination' that
tends towards the extermination -- by one means or another -- of
indigenous peoples.8 This logic is apparent in archetypal settler
narratives]{.underline}** like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the
Mohicans (1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the
melancholia and triumph that demarcate settlers' affective responses to
the supposed inevitability of indigenous extinction**[. Concepts
like]{.underline}** 'stadial development' -- by which societies progress
through stages, progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and
'**[fatal impact]{.underline}**' -- **[which names the biological
inevitability of strong peoples supplanting weak -- all contribute to
the notion that settler colonialism is a kind of 'ecological process' 9
that necessitates the extinction of inferior races]{.underline}**. What
is surprising, though, is how often the trope of extinction also appears
with reference to settlers themselves; it makes sense for settlers to
narrate how their presence entails others' destruction, but it is less
clear why their attempts to imagine futures should presume extinction to
be their own logical end as well. The idea appears repeatedly in
English-language literary treatments of settler colonialism. Consider,
for instance, the following rumination on the future of South African
settler society, from Olive Schreiner's 1883 Story of an African Farm:
It was one of them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those
pictures there. He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make
something, so he made these. \[...\] Now the Boers have shot them all,
so that we never see a yellow face peeping out among the stones. \[...\]
And the wild bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we
will be gone soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at
everything like they look now.10 In this example, the narrating settler
character, Waldo, recognizes prior indigenous inhabitation but his
knowledge comes freighted with an expected sense of biological
superiority, made apparent by his description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow
face', and lack of mental self-awareness. What is not clear is why
Waldo's contemplation of colonial genocide should turn immediately to
the assumption that a similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar
presumption of racial vulnerability permeates other late
nineteenthcentury novels from the imperial metropole, such as Dracula
and War of the Worlds, SETTLER COLONIAL STUDIES 3 which are plotted
around the prospect of invasions that would see the extinction of
British imperialism, and, in the process, the human species. Such
**[anxieties draw energy from a pattern of settler defensiveness that
can be observed across numerous settler-colonial
contexts]{.underline}**. Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of
the emergence of transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical
fact that **[while white male settlers have been arguably the most
privileged class in history]{.underline}**, they have routinely
perceived themselves to be 'under siege', **[threatened with destruction
to the extent that their very identity of '[whiteness was born in the
apprehension of imminent loss']{.mark}. 11 [The fear of looming
annihilation serves a powerful ideological function in settler
communities, working to foster racial solidarity, suppress dissent, and
legitimate violence against indigenous populations who, by any objective
measure, are far more at risk of extermination than the settlers who
fear them]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Ann Curthoys and Dirk Moses have
traced this pattern **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** Australia and
**[[Israel-Palestine, respectively]{.mark}.]{.underline}**12 This
**[[scholarship suggests that narratives of settler extinction are acts
of ideological mystification, obscuring the brutal inequalities of the
frontier behind a mask of white vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
an argument with which I sympathize. However, this article shows how
there is more to settler-colonial extinction narratives than bad faith.
I argue that **[we need a more nuanced understanding of how they encode
a specifically settler-colonial framework for imagining the future, one
that has implications for how we understand contemporary literatures
from settler societies, and which allows us to see extinction as a
genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage social change]{.underline}**. In
the remainder of this paper I **[consider extinction's function as a
metaphor of decolonization.]{.underline}**

#### On the debate space level, big impact disads rely on multiple internal link chains and unlikely scenarios. You should start with a presumption of ZERO risk -- this is key to taking claims about structural violence and oppressive colonialism in the status quo seriously.

Why? Oddly, this is the unreasonable result of a reasonable part of
debate: the burden of refutation or rejoinder, the responsibility of
debaters to "beat" arguments. **[If I introduce an argument, it starts
out at 100 percent---you then have to disprove it.]{.underline}** That
sounds like a pretty good idea in principle, right? Well, I think so
too. **[But [it's really tough to refute something down to "zero"
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a team would need to completely and
totally refute an argument. That's obviously tough to do, especially
since the other team is usually going to have some decent arguments and
pretty good cards defending each component of their disadvantage---even
the ridiculous parts. So **[[one of the most fundamental assumptions
about debate]{.mark} all but [ensures a meaningful risk of nearly any
argument]{.mark}---even extremely low-probability, high magnitude
impacts, sufficient to outweigh systemic impacts]{.underline}**. There's
another even more subtle element of debate practice at play.
Traditionally, the 2AC might introduce 8 or 9 cards against a
disadvantage, like "non-unique, no-link, no-impact," and then go for one
and two. **[Yet in reality[, disadvantages are underpinned by dozens or
perhaps hundreds of discrete assumptions]{.mark}, each of which could be
contested]{.underline}**. By the end of the 2AR, only a handful are
under scrutiny; the majority of the disadvantage is conceded, and it's
tough to bring the one or two scrutinized components down to "zero." And
then there's a bad understanding of probability. **[If the affirmative
questions four or five elements of the disadvantage, but the negative
was still "clearly ahead" on all five elements, most judges would assess
that the negative was "clearly ahead" on the disadvantage. In reality,
the risk of the disadvantage has been reduced
considerably]{.underline}**. If there was, say, an 80 percent chance
that immigration reform would pass, an 80 percent chance that political
capital was key, an 80 percent chance that the plan drained a sufficient
amount of capital, an 80 percent chance that immigration reform was
necessary to prevent another recession, and an 80 percent chance that
another recession would cause a nuclear war (lol), then there's a 32
percent chance that the disadvantage caused nuclear war. I think these
issues can be overcome. First, I **[think [teams can deal with the
"burden of refutation" by focusing on the "burden of proof,"]{.mark}
which allows a team to mitigate an argument before directly
contradicting its content]{.underline}**. Here's how I'd look at it:
**[[modern policy debate has assumed that arguments start out at "100
percent]{.mark}" until directly refuted. [But few, if any, arguments are
supported by evidence consistent with "100 percent."]{.mark} Most cards
don't make definitive claims.]{.underline}** Even when they do, they're
not supported by definitive evidence---and any reasonable person should
assume there's at least some uncertainty on matters other than few true
facts, like 2+2=4. Take Georgetown's immigration uniqueness evidence
from Harvard. It says there "may be a window" for immigration. So, based
on the negative's evidence, what are the odds that immigration reform
will pass? Far less than 50 percent, if you ask me. That's not always
true for every card in the 1NC, but sometimes it's even worse---like the
impact card, which is usually a long string of "coulds." If you apply
this very basic level of analysis to each element of a disadvantage, and
correctly explain math (.4\*.4\*.4\*.4\*.4=.01024), the risk of the
disadvantage starts at a very low level, even before the affirmative
offers a direct response. **[[Debaters should also argue that the
negative hasn't introduced any evidence]{.mark} at all [to
defend]{.mark} a long list of unmentioned elements in [the "internal
link chain]{.mark}." The absence of evidence to defend the argument
that, say, "recession causes depression]{.underline}**," may not
eliminate the disadvantage, but it **[does raise
uncertainty]{.underline}**---and it doesn't take too many additional
sources of uncertainty to reduce the probability of the disadvantage to
effectively zero---sort of the static, background noise of prediction.
Now, I do think it would be nice if a good debate team would actually do
the work---talk about what the cards say, talk about the unmentioned
steps---but I think debaters can make these observations at a meta-level
(your evidence isn't certain, lots of undefended elements) and
successfully reduce the risk of a nuclear war or extinction to something
indistinguishable from zero. It would not be a factor in my decision.
Based on my conversations with other policy judges, it may be possible
to pull it off with even less work. They might be willing to summarily
disregard "absurd" arguments, like politics disadvantages, on the
grounds that it's patently unrealistic, that we know the typical burden
of rejoinder yields unrealistic scenarios, and that judges should assess
debates in ways that produce realistic assessments. I don't think this
is too different from elements of Jonah Feldman's old philosophy, where
he basically said "when I assessed 40 percent last year, it's 10 percent
now." Honestly, I was surprised that the few judges I talked to were so
amenable to this argument. For me, just saying "it's absurd, and you
know it" wouldn't be enough against an argument in which the other team
invested considerable time. The more developed argument about accurate
risk assessment would be more convincing, but I still think it would be
vulnerable to a typical defense of the burden of rejoinder. To be blunt:
I want debaters to learn why a disadvantage is absurd, not just make
assertions that conform to their preexisting notions of what's realistic
and what's not. And perhaps more importantly for this discussion, I
could not coach a team to rely exclusively on this argument---I'm not
convinced that enough judges are willing to discount a disadvantage on
"it's absurd." Nonetheless, I think **[this is a useful "frame" that
preface a following, should more robust explanation of why the risk of
the disadvantage is basically zero---even before a substantive response
is offered]{.underline}**. There are other, broad genres of argument
that can contest the substance of the negative's argument. There are
serious methodological indictments of the various forms of knowledge
production, from journalistic reporting to think tanks to quantitative
social science. Many of our most strongly worded cards come from people
giving opinions, for which they offer very little data or evidence. And
**[even when "qualified" people are giving predictions, there's a great
case to be extremely skeptical without real evidence backing it up. The
world is a complicated place, predictions are hard, and most people are
wrong]{.underline}**. And again, this is before contesting the substance
of the negative's argument(!)---if deemed necessary. So, in my view,
**[the low probability scenario is waiting to be eliminated from
debate]{.underline}**, basically as soon as a capable team tries to do
it. **[That would open to the door to all of the arguments, previously
excluded]{.underline}**, de facto, **[by the prevalence of nuclear war
impacts. [It's been tough to talk about racism or gender violence, since
modest measures to mitigate these impacts have a difficult time
outweighing a nuclear war]{.mark}. It's been tough to discuss ethical
policy making, since it's hard to argue that any commitment to
philosophical or ethical purity should apply in the face of an
existential risk. It's been tough to introduce unconventional forms of
evidence, since they can't really address the probability of nuclear
war]{.underline}**.

#### We control the scale of violence -- the aff frames structural violence in a way that selectively revalues human lives in order to psychologically prime for macro-level conflict

**Scheper & Hughes 4**\[Nancy, Prof of Anthropology, UC Berkeley;
Philippe, Prof of Anthropology UPenn "Introduction: Making Sense of
Violence, in Violence in War and Peace, pg. 19-22\]

This large and at first sight "messy" Part VII is central to this
anthology's thesis. It encompasses everything from the routinized,
bureaucratized, and utterly banal violence of children dying of hunger
and maternal despair in Northeast Brazil (Scheper-Hughes, Chapter 33) to
elderly African Americans dying of heat stroke in Mayor Daly's version
of US apartheid in Chicago's South Side (Klinenberg, Chapter 38) to the
racialized class hatred expressed by British Victorians in their
olfactory disgust of the "smelly" working classes (Orwell, Chapter 36).
In these readings violence is located in the symbolic and social
structures that overdetermine and allow the criminalized drug
addictions, interpersonal bloodshed, and racially patterned
incarcerations that characterize the US "inner city" to be normalized
(Bourgois, Chapter 37 and Wacquant, Chapter 39). Violence also takes the
form of class, racial, political self-hatred and adolescent
self-destruction (Quesada, Chapter 35), as well as of useless
(i.e.  preventable), rawly embodied physical suffering, and death
(Farmer, Chapter 34). [Absolutely central to our approach is a blurring
of categories and distinctions between wartime and peacetime
violence. Close attention to the "little" violences produced in the
structures, habituses, and mentalites of everyday life shifts our
attention to pathologies of class, race, and gender
inequalities.]{.underline}More important, it interrupts the voyeuristic
tendencies of "violence studies" that risk publicly humiliating the
powerless who are often forced into complicity with social and
individual pathologies of power because suffering is often a solvent of
human integrity and dignity. Thus, in this anthology we are positing a
violence continuum comprised of a multitude of "small wars and invisible
genocides" (see also Scheper- Hughes 1996; 1997; 2000b) conducted in the
normative social spaces of public schools, clinics, emergency rooms,
hospital wards, nursing homes, courtrooms, public registry offices,
prisons, detention centers, and public morgues. [The violence continuum
also refers to the ease with which humans are capable of reducing the
socially vulnerable into expendable nonpersonsand assuming the license -
even the duty - to kill, maim, or soul-murder.]{.underline}We realize
that in referring to a violence and a genocide continuum we are flying
in the face of a tradition of genocide studies that argues for the
absolute uniqueness of the Jewish Holocaust and for vigilance with
respect to restricted purist use of the term genocide itself (see Kuper
1985; Chaulk 1999; Fein 1990; Chorbajian 1999). But we hold an opposing
and alternative view that, to the contrary, [it is absolutely necessary
to make just such existential leaps in purposefully linking violent acts
in normal times to those of abnormal times.]{.underline}Hence the title
of our volume: Violence in War and in Peace. If (as we concede) there is
a moral risk in overextending the concept of "genocide" into spaces and
corners of everyday life where we might not ordinarily think to find it
(and [there is), an even greater risk lies in failing to sensitize
ourselves, in misrecognizing protogenocidal practices and sentiments
daily enacted as normative behavior by "ordinary" good-enough citizens.

in the United States (Waquant, Chapter 39), [constitute the "small wars
and invisible genocides"]{.underline}to which we refer. This applies to
African American and Latino youth mortality statistics in Oakland,
California, Baltimore, Washington DC, and New York
City. [These are"invisible" genocides not because they are secreted away
or hidden from view, but quite the opposite.]{.underline}  As
Wittgenstein observed[, the things that are hardest to perceive are
those which are right before our eyes and therefore taken for
granted.]{.underline}In this regard, Bourdieu's partial and unfinished
theory of violence (see Chapters 32 and 42) as well as his concept of
misrecognition is crucial to our task. By including the normative
everyday forms of violence hidden in the minutiae of "normal" social
practices - in the architecture of homes, in gender relations, in
communal work, in the exchange of gifts, and so forth - Bourdieu forces
us to reconsider the broader meanings and status of violence, especially
the links between the violence of everyday life and explicit political
terror and state repression, Similarly, Basaglia's notion of "peacetime
crimes" - crimini di pace - imagines a direct relationship between
wartime and peacetime violence. [Peacetime crimes suggests the
possibility that war crimes are merely ordinary, everyday crimes of
public consent applied systematically and dramatically in the extreme
context of war]{.underline}.Consider the parallel uses of rape during
peacetime and wartime, or the family resemblances between the legalized
violence of US immigration and naturalization border raids on "illegal
aliens" versus the US government- engineered genocide in 1938, known as
the Cherokee "Trail of Tears." Peacetime crimes suggests that everyday
forms of state violence make a certain kind of domestic peace
possible.  Internal "stability" is purchased with the currency of
peacetime crimes, many of which take the form of professionally applied
"strangle-holds." Everyday forms of state violence during peacetime make
a certain kind of domestic "peace" possible. It is an easy-to-identify
peacetime crime that is usually maintained as a public secret by the
government and by a scared or apathetic populace. Most subtly, but no
less politically or structurally, the phenomenal growth in the United
States of a new military, postindustrial prison industrial complex has
taken place in the absence of broad-based opposition, let alone
collective acts of civil disobedience. [The public consensus is based
primarily on a new mobilization of an old fear of the mob, the mugger,
the rapist, the Black man, the undeserving poor. How many public
executions of mentally deficient prisoners in the United States are
needed to make life feel more secure for the affluent? ]{.underline}What
can it possibly mean when incarceration becomes the "normative"
socializing experience for ethnic minority youth in a society, i.e.,
over 33 percent of young African American men (Prison Watch 2002). In
the end [it is essential that we recognize the existence of a genocidal
capacity among otherwise good-enough humans and that we need to exercise
a defensive hypervigilance to the less dramatic, permitted, and even
rewarded everyday acts of violence that render participation in
genocidal acts and policies possible]{.underline}(under adverse
political or economic conditions), perhaps more easily than we would
like to recognize. [Under the violence continuum we include,
therefore, all expressions of radical social exclusion, dehumanization,
depersonalization, pseudospeciation, and reification which normalize
atrocious behavior and violence toward others. A constant
self-mobilization for alarm, a state of constant hyperarousal is,
perhaps, a reasonable response to Benjamin's view of late modern history
as a chronic "state of emergency"]{.underline}(Taussig, Chapter 31). We
are trying to recover here the classic anagogic thinking that enabled
Erving Goffman, Jules Henry, C. Wright Mills, and Franco Basaglia among
other mid-twentieth-century radically critical thinkers, to perceive the
symbolic and structural relations, i.e., between inmates and patients,
between concentration camps, prisons, mental hospitals, nursing homes,
and other "total institutions." [Making that decisive move to recognize
the continuum of violence allows us to see the capacity and the
willingness - if not enthusiasm - of ordinary people, the practical
technicians of the social consensus, to enforce genocidal-like crimes
against categories of rubbish people. There is no primary impulse out of
which mass violence and genocide are born, it is ingrained in the common
sense of everyday social life.  The mad, the differently abled, the
mentally vulnerable have often falleninto this category of the unworthy
living, as have the very old and infirm, the sick-poor, and, of
course, the despised racial, religious, sexual, and ethnic groups of the
moment.]{.underline}Erik Erikson referred to "pseudo- speciation" as the
human tendency to classify some individuals or social groups as less
than fully human - a prerequisite to genocide and one that is carefully
honed during the unremark- able peacetimes that precede the sudden,
"seemingly unintelligible" outbreaks of mass violence[. Collective
denial and misrecognition are prerequisites for mass violence and
genocide.]{.underline}But so are formal bureaucratic structures and
professional roles. The practical technicians of everyday violence in
the backlands of Northeast Brazil (Scheper-Hughes, Chapter 33), for
example, include the clinic doctors who prescribe powerful tranquilizers
to fretful and frightfully hungry babies, the Catholic priests who
celebrate the death of "angel-babies," and the municipal bureaucrats who
dispense free baby coffins but no food to hungry families.  [Everyday
violence encompasses the implicit, legitimate, and routinized forms of
violence inherent in particular social, economic, and political
formations.]{.underline}It is close to what Bourdieu (1977, 1996) means
by "symbolic violence," the violence that is often "nus-recognized" for
something else, usually something good. Everyday violence is similar to
what Taussig (1989) calls "terror as usual." All these terms are meant
to reveal a public secret - the hidden links between violence in war and
violence in peace, and between war crimes and "peace-time crimes."
Bourdieu (1977) finds domination and violence in the least likely
places - in courtship and marriage, in the exchange of gifts, in systems
of classification, in style, art, and culinary taste- the various uses
of culture. Violence, Bourdieu insists, is everywhere in social
practice. It is misrecognized because its very everydayness and its
familiarity render it invisible. Lacan identifies "rneconnaissance" as
the prerequisite of the social. The exploitation of bachelor sons,
robbing them of autonomy, independence, and progeny, within the
structures of family farming in the European countryside that Bourdieu
escaped is a case in point (Bourdieu, Chapter 42; see also
Scheper-Hughes, 2000b; Favret-Saada, 1989).  Following Gramsci,
Foucault, Sartre, Arendt, and other modern theorists of power-vio-
lence, Bourdieu treats direct aggression and physical violence as a
crude, uneconomical mode of domination; it is less efficient and,
according to Arendt (1969), it is certainly less legitimate.  While
power and symbolic domination are not to be equated with violence - and
Arendt argues persuasively that violence is to be understood as a
failure of power - violence, as we are presenting it here, is more than
simply the expression of illegitimate physical force against a person or
group of persons. Rather, we need to understand violence as encompassing
all forms of "controlling processes" (Nader 1997b) that assault basic
human freedoms and individual or collective survival. Our task is to
recognize these gray zones of violence which are, by definition, not
obvious. Once again, the point of bringing into the discourses on
genocide everyday, normative experiences of reification,
depersonalization, institutional confinement, and acceptable death is to
help answer the question: What makes mass violence and genocide
possible? In this volume we are suggesting [that mass violence is part
of a continuum, and that it is socially incremental and often
experienced by perpetrators, collaborators, bystanders - and even by
victims themselves - as expected, routine, even justified]{.underline}.
The preparations for mass killing can be found in social sentiments and
institutions from the family, to schools, churches, hospitals, and the
military. [They harbor the]{.underline}early "warning signs" (Charney
1991), the ["priming"]{.underline}(as Hinton, ed., 2002 calls it), or
the "genocidal continuum" (as we call it) [that push social consensus
toward devaluing certain forms of human life]{.underline}and lifeways
from the refusal of social support and humane care to vulnerable "social
parasites" (the nursing home elderly, "welfare queens," undocumented
immigrants, drug addicts) to the militarization of everyday life
(super-maximum-security prisons, capital punishment; the technologies of
heightened personal security, including the house gun and gated
communities; and reversed feelings of victimization).

## Harms and Solvency

### More harms and US links

#### Aids packages, special favors, circumvention and lack of US accountability all make Americans complicit in Israeli atrocities

Illegally,"

**[ISRAEL IS THE RECIPIENT OF THE LARGEST ANNUAL PACKAGE of Foreign
Military Financing, the grant program that allows foreign countries to
purchase U.S.-made weapons.]{.underline}** The current terms, signed
under the Obama administration and implemented by President Donald
Trump, give Israel \$38 billion in U.S. military aid in the next 10
years, an increase of \$8 billion over the previous decade. **[This
includes \$5 billion for missile defense]{.underline}**.

**[Israel is one of a handful of countries that can use Foreign Military
Financing grants to buy directly from private U.S. weapons corporations,
a process with much less U.S. oversight than Foreign Military Sales,
where the U.S. government coordinates the purchase of
weaponry]{.underline}**. **[And in a unique arrangement, Israel can use
about 25 percent of its U.S. military aid to buy equipment made by
Israeli companies]{.underline}**. (This arrangement will end over the
next decade.)

It's a lucrative deal for U.S. weapons manufacturers. According to a
State Department report, the U.S. authorized the shipment of almost \$3
million in firearms last year---like the Ruger sniper rifle that killed
Obeid. But it's unclear how much a particular company like Ruger is
profiting; the U.S. government does not break down the purchases by
manufacturer. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth
Ahronoth [reported](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4349902,00.html) that
**[in 2011, the Israeli military bought over \$27 million worth of
equipment in preparation for West Bank protests. The shipments included
Ruger rifles and tear-gas canisters]{.underline}**.

**[Foreign Military Financing money is not supposed to flow with no
strings attached]{.underline}**. In 1998, Congress passed what came to
be known as **[the Leahy Law]{.underline}**, authored by Sen. Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.). The legislation **[bans U.S. military aid and training
from going to foreign security units that commit human rights
abuses,]{.underline}** unless the secretary of state determines that the
foreign country is holding members of the unit accountable. **[The law
is rarely exercised]{.underline}**. According to a 2017 [RAND
Corporation study](http://file/Users/marco/Downloads/RAND_RR1737.pdf),
of 180,000 units and individuals vetted by the U.S. government each year
under the Leahy Law, only 0.3 percent are rejected for U.S. assistance,
in countries such as Colombia, Honduras and Nigeria.

Because the Leahy Law is narrow---it only bars assistance to particular
military units that commit rights violations, rather than the entire
foreign army---**[Palestinian rights advocates working in Washington see
enforcement against Israel as an achievable goal that could curb
civilian deaths.]{.underline}**

"**[The Leahy Law being implemented would not end violations, but I
think it would seriously constrain \[them\],"]{.underline}** says Brad
Parker, international advocacy officer and staff attorney at [Defense
for Children International-Palestine](https://www.dci-palestine.org/).
"Israeli officials would have to scrutinize military decisions and the
use of force in a way that would ultimately increase protection for
Palestinian civilians."

The State Department did not answer questions from In These Times about
whether any Israeli army units have been barred from receiving U.S.
weapons under the Leahy Law or whether the State Department has acted on
specific evidence of Israeli soldiers misusing U.S. arms. **[A State
Department official told ]{.underline}**In These **[Times in a statement
that the department "continues to apply the Leahy Law across the board,
including in Israel, as it has for years. ... We take seriously any
credible information of a gross violation of human rights, and we review
alleged violations utilizing standardized criteria
worldwide.]{.underline}**"

**[This statement is disputed by Bill Harper]{.underline}**, chief of
staff to Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), **[who has emerged as the
leading congressional critic of Israeli human rights abuses. "They
cannot credibly make the claim that they enforce the law equally,"
Harper says. "We enforce it where we want and ignore it where we
don't."]{.underline}**

In a February 2016 letter,
Leahy [wrote](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/patrick-leahy-senate-israel-egypt-state-221366) to
Secretary of State John Kerry about his concerns that the State
Department is not adequately monitoring the use of U.S. military aid to
Israel, and asked for an investigation into whether Israel committed
extrajudicial executions with U.S. weapons. "**[There have been a
disturbing number of reports of possible gross violations of human
rights by security forces in Israel or Egypt---incidents that may have
involved recipients, or potential recipients, of U.S. military
assistance,]{.underline}**" Leahy wrote. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu [responded](http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-pans-us-senators-call-to-probe-extrajudicial-killings/?fb_comment_id=965724690207812_967351856711762) that
Israeli soldiers "are not murderers" and act in a "moral manner."

In meetings and conversations with the State Department from 2012 to
2015, Mike Coogan, then the legislative coordinator for the U.S.
Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, says he brought up a [2009 Human
Rights Watch
report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/03/25/rain-fire/israels-unlawful-use-white-phosphorus-gaza) on
**[U.S.-supplied white phosphorus]{.underline}** that **[killed
Palestinians in Gaza]{.underline}**. He also communicated with officials
about **[a [2014 Amnesty International
report](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/002/2014/en/) document]{.underline}**ing
**[U.S.-made tear gas canisters killing Palestinian
protesters.]{.underline}**

"State said we'll look into it and we'll get back to you," Coogan says.
"But they never got back to us."

Brad Parker told In These Times that, in meetings about the Leahy Law
during the Obama administration's second term, State Department
officials said they do not track where weapons go once they are sent to
Israeli units, making it difficult to assess whether the weapons are
being misused.

One former U.S. official familiar with how the Leahy Law is implemented
(who requested anonymity out of concern about losing their current job,
which involves working with State Department officials), says that the
State Department doesn't "have much of a record of understanding where
material assistance flows."

The former official believes that an **[unwillingness to challenge
Israel is one reason the broader lack of monitoring goes unaddressed.
"Getting more fidelity on specific instances of assistance to, say,
Nigeria or Kenya ... raises the defenses of a number of different
pockets of support for Israel, who are concerned that our support for
Israel will be in question or at risk."]{.underline}**

**[Support for Israel on Capitol Hill is driven by a multi-pronged
machine: the weapons industry, which makes money from U.S. military aid
to Israel; donors, who give to pro-Israel politicians, both Democrats
and Republicans; Christian evangelicals, who see support for Israel as
part of biblical prophecy and make up a large part of the Republican
base; and Israel's lobbyists, who continually push Washington to ramp up
support.]{.underline}**

The current State Department official interviewed for this story also
describes a general reluctance to confront allies: "We never want to
deliver bad news to them. \... The implementation of the Leahy Law is
where you see the downsides of that."

**[UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, which has fully thrown its support
behind Israel's right-wing government, resistance to enforcing the Leahy
Law remains.]{.underline}**

In leaked
emails [published](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/16/trump-ambassador-israel-scrutiny-military-human-rights-david-friedman-650383) by Politico in
June 2018, **[U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedm]{.underline}**an
(who, before his appointment, fundraised millions of dollars for Israeli
settlements) **[pushed back against State Department efforts to improve
how U.S. military aid to Israel is monitored.]{.underline}** According
to Politico, Friedman wrote in October 2017 that **[he did "not believe
we should extend" these efforts]{.underline}**, in the form of
guidelines on how to better vet military aid, "to Israel at this time."
Friedman went on to say that "Israel is a democracy whose army does not
engage in gross violations of human rights" and that limiting U.S.
military aid to Israeli units would be "against national interests."

While the rhetoric against enforcing the Leahy Law more strictly against
Israel may have hardened under Trump, **[there has been no policy change
from Obama to Trump]{.underline}**, according to Raed Jarrar, an expert
on the Leahy Law.

"The difference is the mask has fallen, like many other things with
Trump," Jarrar says. "**[When it comes to the policies on the ground ...
there's no difference. There was no attempt to hold Israel accountable
in the past, and there is no attempt to hold Israel accountable now,
either."]{.underline}**

**[Meanwhile, as the Israeli occupation grinds on and Congress continues
to sign off on U.S. aid and arms to Israel, Palestinians are left to
fume at the fact that U.S. weapons companies, purchased with U.S.
taxpayer cash, are supplying Israel with the arms that are killing
civilians.]{.underline}**

"I hope they taste the same pain we feel for our children," says Asmaa
Shaheen, Sabaa Obeid's mother. "They're responsible for the blood that's
shed."

THE
[VIDEO](https://www.btselem.org/video/20170613_killing_of_sabaa_ubeid_in_nabi_saleh)
SHOWS A FAMILIAR WEST BANK SCENE. As a Palestinian flag in Nabi Saleh
flutters in the wind on a spring day in 2017, two Palestinians with
slingshots launch stones at Israeli soldiers. About a dozen others stand
to the side, behind the ruins of a demolished house, calmly observing.
Then, a young man wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, alone, is seen
heading up a slight slope toward the house. The camera jerks for a
second, and the youth disappears from the frame. A single shot rings
out. The observers duck. The young man, back in the frame, is running
toward the others, holding his stomach. Then he falls. The screams for
an ambulance begin. **[The young man's name was Sabaa
Obeid]{.underline}**, a 22-year-old from Salfit, a town about 13 miles
north. **[He]{.underline}**, too, **[had been throwing
stones]{.underline}**. **[Shot by one of the Israeli soldiers, he was
declared dead later that day]{.underline}**. Witnesses to the
confrontation say **[the armed soldiers were never in life threatening
danger from the stones, which were flung from hundreds of feet away. No
Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian stone-thrower at a
protest]{.underline}** in the past 18 years, according to statistics
compiled by Israeli human rights group
[B'Tselem](https://www.btselem.org/). (The Israeli military did not
return requests for information.) "Stone-throwing poses little or no
serious risk to Israeli soldiers, who are generally too far away for the
stone-throwers to have any chance of hitting them,"
[wrote](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/8000/mde150022014en.pdf)
Amnesty International in a 2014 report. "**[Israeli forces frequently
respond to such stone-throwing protests using grossly excessive
force]{.underline}**." **[The soldier who killed Obeid
used]{.underline}** a Ruger sniper rifle, **[a weapon
manufactured]{.underline}** by Sturm, Ruger & Co., **[the third biggest
gun company in the United States. U.S. taxpayer dollars likely paid for
it]{.underline}**. Israel must spend roughly 75 percent of its [annual
military aid from the United
States](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)on U.S.-made
weapons. **[The shooting of Obeid with a U.S.-made weapon was not an
isolated incident. Human rights groups have recorded dozens of incidents
of the Israeli military using U.S.-made weapons in unlawful ways to
injure and kill Palestinian civilians]{.underline}**. During weekly
demonstrations in Gaza last spring, for example, Amnesty International
[documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/israel-arms-embargo-needed-as-military-unlawfully-kills-and-maims-gaza-protesters/)
Israeli snipers injuring unarmed Palestinian protesters using weapons
manufactured by Remington, the U.S.'s second largest gun corporation.
**[Taken together, witness testimony, video evidence and human-rights
reports paint a picture of U.S. arms flowing to an Israeli army that
recklessly uses live ammunition on civilians who pose little threat, in
apparent violation of international law]{.underline}**. "Theoretically,
**[you're only allowed to use live ammunition in very extreme cases of
grave danger to life]{.underline}**," says Sarit Michaeli, the
international advocacy officer for B'Tselem. "**[The \[Israeli\] army
has a much broader definition, \[with\] all of these specific
descriptions---but none of them apply to a demonstration where some
youth are throwing stones." Israel's army has long deployed U.S. weapons
to kill Palestinian civilians]{.underline}**. An In These Times survey
of detailed **[reports published by the United Nations, Israeli human
rights group B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International]{.underline}** **[revea]{.underline}**ls that, since 2009,
**[at least 272 Palestinians appear to have been killed by U.S.-made
weapons used by Israeli forces.]{.underline}** Fourteen of these
killings occurred during law enforcement situations (outside of an
active war zone), such as during demonstrations. Some of these incidents
have been captured on video. In [one video from
2016](https://www.btselem.org/video/20160324_soldier_executes_palestinian_attacker_in_hebron),
for example, an Israeli soldier, armed with a U.S.-made M4 assault
rifle, executed an injured Palestinian who was lying still on a Hebron
street after he stabbed a soldier. **[The full death toll of
Palestinians killed by U.S. weapons is likely far higher]{.underline}**,
since many reports are not able to identify the weapon used. It's not
supposed to be this way. **[U.S. arms exports to Israel (and other
countries) are governed by laws placing restrictions on sales to nations
that abuse human rights]{.underline}**. Campaigns to cut U.S. military
aid to Israel have latched onto a particular measure, known as **[the
Leahy Law]{.underline}**. The **[law prohibits U.S. assistance or
training from flowing to foreign military units that have committed a
gross violation of human rights]{.underline}**, unless the foreign
government has held that unit accountable. **[But]{.underline}**
interviews with human rights advocates, congressional aides and former
and current U.S. officials reveal that **[enforcement of the Leahy Law
in Israel is lax, with no tracking of which army units receive U.S.
weapons]{.underline}**. **[Human rights advocates]{.underline}** say
they **[have brought the State Department evidence of specific crimes
committed by soldiers who clearly used U.S. weapons, only to have that
evidence brushed off]{.underline}**. A current U.S. official, who asked
for anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press and
could be fired as a result, told In These Times that they are not aware
of any time when an Israeli unit was cut off from U.S. assistance under
the Leahy Law. **[This lack of enforcement allows Israel to get away
with extrajudicial executions of Palestinian]{.underline}**s, human
rights advocates say. Maria LaHood, deputy legal director at the [Center
for Constitutional Rights](https://ccrjustice.org/), says **[the United
States' "unparalleled support for Israel" gives it leverage to end these
extrajudicial killings if it chooses]{.underline}**. "**[Our government
does not lack the legal tools to put an end to Israel's human rights
violations,"]{.underline}** she says**[. "It lacks the political
will.]{.underline}**"

[[**Israel does n**o**t**]{.underline} **[need foreign
aid]{.underline}**]{.mark}---it is a wealthy nation with a booming
hi-tech sector. Weaknesses elsewhere in the economy are largely
self-inflicted through collectivist economic practices. Moreover, Israel
is a regional military superpower. If anything, the transfers should run
in the other direction. **[However, the]{.underline}** **[Senate is
considering]{.underline}** legislation **[to extend \$9 billion in loan
guarantees and]{.underline}** provide more **[military
support]{.underline}**. Rather than reflect warming ties, however, the
extra cash indicates an election-year financial raid. Israeli
politicians enjoy having more American money to spend while U.S.
politicians enjoy spending more American money to win votes. Yet even
some **[Israelis doubt that American "assistance" is so good for their
nation]{.underline}**. Last year, Yarden Gazit of the Jerusalem
Institute for Market Studies wrote a study that warned "a good many
people do not appreciate the real costs of America's assistance to
Israel." His analysis suggests that true friendship for Israel would be
to set it free. Washington has provided more than \$110 billion in aid
over the years, not counting loan guarantees. Last year, figured Gazit,
American support accounted for 1.5 percent of Israel's GDP, 4 percent of
the government's budget and 24 percent of security outlays. Since
2008**[[, all U.S. aid has been for the military]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
but money is fungible. **[[Israel receives \$3 billion annually,
three-quarters of which must be used for the purchase of U.S.
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Gazit noted: "While on the face of it,
three billion dollars of annual assistance seems fully advantageous, a
closer look reveals not a few shortcomings." Money from America has
conditions, most notably the requirement that **[Israel purchase U.S.
weapons, which raises Israeli acquisition costs]{.underline}**. Gazit
estimated that **[America's "gift" may cost around \$600
million]{.underline}**. That's a fifth of the nominal "foreign aid."
That money, at least**[, is primarily a subsidy to U.S. arms
makers.]{.underline}** Washington also links aid between Israel and
Egypt. The latter typically receives two-thirds of whatever Israel
collects. The transformation across the Nile could upend the
arrangement, especially if Cairo abandons peace with Israel, but so far
the relationship continues. Jordan, too, receives bountiful American
subsidies---about \$700 million last year. Although the Egyptian and
Jordanian grants are a mix of economic and military support, again,
money is fungible. And that means American aid frees up resources for
Egyptian and Jordanian military use. While the danger of either country
attacking Israel remains small, Gazit pointed out that Israel "must be
prepared for any eventuality---even one of very low probability---of a
defensive war on either the Egyptian or the Jordanian front." Thus, the
more money given by America to Egypt and Jordan, the more Israel must
spend on its military.Added Gazit: "With **[Israel's comparative
disadvantage in terms of relative population]{.underline}** (over ten
Egyptians for every Israeli), **[maintaining]{.underline}** a
qualitative advantage in **[equipment and weaponry is
critical]{.underline}**." Gazit cited researcher Erez Raphaeli in
asserting that every extra dollar to Egypt requires an Israeli
expenditure of \$1.30 to \$1.40 to maintain the military balance. In
this way, complained Gazit, "[**[Not only does]{.underline}**
**[American assistance not provide Israel with an economic advantage, it
requires Israel to expend additional amounts from its own internal
security reserves]{.underline}**]{.mark}." There's another problem with
U.S. aid. **[While bilateral defense cooperation has helped boost the
Israeli arms industry, the conditions on American aid do the
opposite.]{.underline}** Since in some cases the Israeli government has
to go with U.S. weapons even if the domestic products were better,
cheaper or both, efficient Israeli producers lose government contracts
and consequent economies of scale. **[Israeli companies]{.underline}**
also **[have to purchase American raw materials, which raise the costs
of Israeli weapons]{.underline}** in world markets. Further, notes
Gazit: "Due to Israel's reputation as a military power, any acquisition
choice of Israel's will instantly increase the demand for that product
on the international market. When a foreign country contemplates a
purchase from an Israeli arms manufacturer, the question of whether
Israel's own army uses that product often plays into the decision."
Thus, if the Israeli government buys American instead, Israeli companies
may lose contracts abroad. Washington even uses its leverage to limit
Israeli overseas arms sales. For instance, in 2000 Congress threatened
to reduce aid if Israel provided weapons to China. "**[[American
assistance places pressure on Israel in this area, with the resulting
economic loss]{.underline}]{.mark}**," says Gazit. Another impact of
foreign aid on Israel is the same as elsewhere---a disincentive to be
efficient. **[The guaranteed payment irrespective of Israel's defense
needs "leaves the system with no incentive to become more
efficient,"]{.underline}** warns Gazit. Former prime minister Ehud
Olmert argued that Israel could cut its military outlays with no harm to
its security but that American money reduces the pressure to do so.
Perhaps even worse is how **[U[.S. "assistance" further inflates
Israel's]{.mark} already [bloated government]{.mark}.
Government-to-government "aid" has expanded the]{.underline}**
overbearing, money-wasting regulatory **[state]{.underline}** around the
globe. Israel is no different. Explains Gazit: **[[Without this
aid]{.mark},]{.underline}** it stands to reason that **[[the government
would]{.mark} be forced to reduce the public sector in size, through
defense budget cuts,]{.underline}** restructuring **[and increased
efficiency]{.underline}** in other frameworks**[. This would
[direct]{.mark} many]{.underline}** more **[[resources
to]{.underline}]{.mark}**ward the private sector, which would be
motivated to seek creative and **[[growth-oriented solutions, involving
personnel, financing, as well as land]{.mark}]{.underline}** and other
resources currently **[held by the government]{.underline}***.*
Encouraging a larger and less efficient government naturally reduces
Israel's economic strength, which is necessary to maintain an effective
defense. More broadly, he argues, "the Government of Israel's reliance
on the American taxpayer sets a negative example which acts to encourage
a culture of dependence."

### US policy fuels colonizing

#### United States Arms sales are complicit in the death of Israeli-Palestinian peace -- current U.S. policy specifically fuels Israeli settlerism

**[Tolan 16]{.underline}** (Sandy Tolan, 10-18-2016, \"American Weapons
Are Blocking True Peace Between Israel and Palestine,\" Nation,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/american-weapons-are-blocking-true-peace-between-israel-and-palestine/>)
//AT

[The military alliance between the United States and Israel has long
been at odds with the stated intentions of successive administrations in
Washington to foster peace in the Holy Land. One White House after
another has preferred the "solution" of having it both ways: supporting
a two-state solution while richly rewarding, with lethal weaponry, an
incorrigible client state that was working as fast as it could to
undermine just such a solution]{.underline}.

This ongoing duality seemed at its most surreal in the last few weeks.
First, President [Obama announced the new military deal, with its
promised delivery of fighter jets and other hardware, citing the
"unshakable" American military alliance with Israel]{.underline}. The
following week, at the United Nations, he declared, ["Israel must
recognize that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian
land."]{.underline} Next, he flew to Israel for the funeral of Shimon
Peres, and in a tribute to the Nobel Prize--winning former Israeli
president, spoke of a man who grasped that "the Jewish people weren't
born to rule another people" and [brought up the "unfinished business"
of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process]{.underline}. (Peres is
remembered quite differently by Palestinians as an early pioneer of
settlement building and the author of the brutal Operation Grapes of
Wrath assaults on Lebanon in 1996.) Not long after the funeral, [the
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brazenly approved a new
settlement deep in the West Bank, prompting the State Department to
"strongly condemn" the action as "deeply troubling]{.underline}."

Such scolding words, however, shrivel into nothingness in the face of a
single number: 38 billion. [With its latest promise of military aid, the
United States has essentially sanctioned Israel's impunity, its endless
colonization of Palestinian land, its military occupation of the West
Bank, and its periodic attacks by F-16 fighter jets and Apache
helicopters using Hellfire missiles on the civilians of
Gaza]{.underline}.

Yes, Hamas's crude and occasionally deadly rockets sometimes help
provoke Israeli fire, and human rights investigations have found that
both sides have committed war crimes. B[ut Israel's explosive power in
the 2014 Gaza war, fueled in large part by American military aid and
political support, exceeded that of Hamas by an estimated
1,500-to-1]{.underline}. By one estimate, all of Hamas's rockets,
measured in explosive power, were equal to 12 of the one-ton bombs
Israel dropped on Gaza. And it loosed hundreds of those, and fired tens
of thousands of shells, rockets and mortars. In the process, [nearly 250
times more Palestinian civilians died than civilians in
Israel]{.underline}.

[Now, with Gaza severed from the West Bank, and Palestinians facing new
waves of settlers amid a half-century-long military occupation, the
United States has chosen not to apply pressure to its out-of-control
ally, but instead to resupply its armed forces in a massive
way]{.underline}. This means that we've finally arrived at something of
a historic (if hardly noticed) moment. [After all these decades, the
two-state solution, critically flawed as it was, should now officially
be declared dead---and consider the United States an accomplice in its
murder]{.underline}. In other words, the Obama administration has handed
Israel's leaders and the neoconservatives who have long championed this
path the victory they've sought for more than two decades.

Zank](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/629170/summary), a professor at

Both laws were enacted during times when the international coalition was
making progress with the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. U.S.
President Jimmy Carter and Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat had signed
the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty with Israel and Egypt in 1979;
consequently, the Jerusalem Basic Law endangered the peace process and
negatively impacted the ongoing negotiations.

The Jerusalem Embassy Act was signed into law shortly after the Oslo
Accords were concluded and greatly affected the final status
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that were held
at Camp David in 2000. Both these legislative acts created a binding
relationship between Israel and the U.S which ultimately changed the
status quo.

**[But to fully conceptualize the U.S.-Israel special relationship we
need to unpack the the preferential arms trade agreements that allows
for this relationship to continue at the expense of the indigenous
population in the occupied territories.]{.underline}**

Max Ajl, a PhD candidate in development sociology at Cornell
University, [writes](http://inthesetimes.com/article/19479/the-israeli-aid-package-10-more-years-of-the-special-relationship):
***["U.S. 'military assistance,' more accurately understood as a
circular flow through which U.S. weapons firms profit off the
colonization of Palestinian land and Israeli destabilization of the
surrounding states, is a long-term structuring element of the
U.S.-Israel 'special relationship.]{.underline}**'*"

**[U.S.
military [loans](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-u-s-foreign-aid-to-israel) started
arriving in Israel in November 1971]{.underline}**, when the Nixon
administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel to build
up its domestic industrial-arms sector through technical and
manufacturing assistance. **[Grants started to replace loans in
1974]{.underline}**.

**[The U.S. government shortly afterwards started to permit Israel to
spend 26% of the annual military grant on purchases in
Israel]{.underline}** -- a unique arrangement, since by U.S. law
recipient countries must spend all of their foreign military financing
in the U.S.

According to Ajl, "**[the Israeli military industry often relies on U.S.
technological inputs, and the U.S. forbids Israel from manufacturing
crucial heavy weaponry, such as fighter jets, in order to maintain
control over Israel]{.underline}**."

**[U.S. military grants to Israel were often quid pro quo, as Israel
increasingly took on the work for which the U.S. could not publicly take
responsibility, given popular unease in the States over aid to fascist
dictatorships.]{.underline}**

As the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network noted in
their [report](http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/israels-worldwide-role-in-repression-footnotes-finalized.pdf),
Israel's Worldwide Role in Repression, **[in the 1970s, Israel armed the
brutal military regime of the Argentinian junta that imposed seven years
of state terrorism on the population]{.underline}**. **[Israel also
provided most of the arms that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio "Tachito"
Somoza used in the last year of his dictatorship to oppose the
revolution, a conflict that killed tens of thousands of Nicaraguans in
the 1970s]{.underline}**.

**[By the 2000s, the Israeli military-industrial complex had produced an
industry capable of competing in small-arms and high-end security
technology on a worldwide scale. Israel started to export arms that have
been refined through high-technology colonial policing of the
Palestinian population, especially in the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank]{.underline}**. In recent years, Israel has risen to one of
the [top 10 arms
exporters](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5174345,00.html) in

"**[Israel's defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an

Israe]{.underline}**l. **[There was a shift in original MOU that would
slowly phase out the provisions through which Israel could spend up to
26% of its funding package within Israel, to Israel spending more of
this funding on the advanced military capabilities that only the United
States can provide]{.underline}** -- as much as \$1.2 billion per year,
according to Ajl.

**[In addition, this MOU locked in \$500 million annually for missile
defense. The MOU mandates Israel update its fighter aircraft fleet,

<http://inthesetimes.com/features/israel-palestine-killings-us-aid-military-weapons.html>

Israel as Arms Merchant and Pacification Ideologue

Without exaggeration, War Against the People, is really three books in
one. It is first of all **[a comprehensive and detailed look at the
elaborate Israeli arms industry, including the extensive network of
private companies engaged in arms production.]{.underline}** Halper
**[explores how Israel managed to become such a valued producer of
sophisticated weaponry that so many governments have come to depend
upo]{.underline}**n. Part of **[Israel's success in the highly
competitive international arms market is to identify and develop niches
for itself in the wider global arms market that allows it to compete
successfully for market share]{.underline}** with companies backed by
several of the world's largest states by supplying specific kinds of
weaponry that outperform the alternatives available for purchase. By so
serving as an arms merchant to no less than 130 countries gives Israel a
powerful unacknowledged source of leverage throughout the entire world.
**[An aspect of Israel's success is to be apolitical in its operations
as an arms supplier, provided only that the foreign government poses no
security threat to Israel.]{.underline}**

Secondly, the book is **[a detailed examination of the specific ways
that Israel has adapted its security doctrine and practice to the
varieties of Palestinian resistance over the decades]{.underline}**. The
Israeli approach **[rests on adopting a goal toward internal security
that seeks to achieve a tolerable level of "pacification" of the
Palestinian population]{.underline}**. **[As such it does not seek to
"defeat" the Palestinians]{.underline}**, including even Hamas, **[and
is content with keeping violent resistance contained so that Israelis
can go about their lives with reasonable security and the economy can
prosper]{.underline}**. At the same time, the threat of violent
resistance never entirely disappears or is absent from the political
consciousness and experience of Israeli society, and the fear factor
keeps Israelis supportive of oppressive internal policies.
P**[acification in the face of a potentially very hostile minority
Palestinian presence in pre-1967 Israel has presupposed a fusing of
Israel's military, paramilitary, police, and intelligence capabilities,
but also a less understood Israeli politics of restraint.]{.underline}**
**[The capabilities to sustain pacifications must be continuously
updated and adapted to evolving circumstances, including shifts in
Palestinian tactics of resistance]{.underline}**.

**[This mental shift from "victory" over the natives to their relentless
"pacification" to some extent reflects the ethical orientation of a
post-colonial world. In many respects Israel represents a species of
settler colonialism, but it takes the form of seeking some kind of
imposed accommodation with the native population rather than their
extinction or spatial marginalization. Actually, as Israeli politics
have moved further and further to the right, the tactics of pacification
have become more coercive and brutal, and do seem to push the original
dispossession of the nakba toward some kind of "final solution" by way
of settlement expansion]{.underline}** as likely supplemented at some
point by population transfer and by periodic massive military operations
of the sort that have occurred in Gaza in 2008-2009, 2012, and 2014.
**[In other words, pacification as conceived in the 1950s has become
quite something more ominous for the Palestinians in the twenty-first
century as "Palestine" shrinks in size and diminishes in threat while
Israel's territorial ambitions continue to expand and seem to be within
reach]{.underline}**.

The Israel/Palestine encounter is certainly unique in several of its
aspects, yet it bears sufficient similarity to a range of threats facing
many governments in the world to allow the Israeli government to serve
as an exemplary practitioner of counterinsurgency war/politics. It is
precisely the generality of contemporary security challenges situated
within society that makes the Israeli experience seem so valuable to
others, especially when reinforced by the widespread impression that
Israel's security policies have succeeded in the face of difficult
challenges over an extended period. This combination of considerations
gives Israel's weapons, training programs, and security doctrines their
global resonance. Especially in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the
long-term character of the Israeli experience became a strong credential
on the arms market and among strategy-minded think tanks. **[Israel's
perceived counterinsurgency record has even led other governments to
mute or even abandon their criticisms of the manner in which Israel
suppresses Palestinians and flaunts international law. In this way, the
Israeli network of arms sales arrangements has not only functioned as
direct sources of influence and economic benefit to Israel, but also
contributed a political payoff by weakening motivations at the
UN]{.underline}** and elsewhere in the world to exert meaningful
pressure on Israel to modify its policies and uphold its obligations
under international law. What Halper helps us to understand is **[this
rarely discussed relationship between the arms trade and what might be
called an international diplomacy of pacification. In effect, Israel has
quietly bought off most of its potentially most dangerous governmental
adversaries by making itself an invaluable collaborator in the security
domain]{.underline}**, **[which is given priority by every government
when it comes to shaping its foreign policy. The reach of this weapons
diplomacy is further extended due to Israel's willingness to do arms
deals discreetly with the most repressive of regimes around the world
even while at the same time it takes great pains to substantiate the
claim that Israel remains the only democracy in the Middle
East.]{.underline}**

### 2AC: Decol k2 to self-determination

#### Decolonization allows for Palestinian self-determination -- egalitarian bi-nationalism stifles Zionism, fosters cooperation, and protects ethnic boundaries

//AT

Our contention is that [egalitarian bi-nationalism, as a paradigm which
recognises and promotes the existence of two national groups with equal
rights to self-determination, offers far more fertile ground for
envisioning decolonisation in Israel/Palestine]{.underline}. Egalitarian
bi-nationalists and liberal one-staters agree that [partition and
segregation are infeasible and normatively undesirable]{.underline}
(e.g. [Benvenisti,
2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4);
[Said,
1999](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4)).
However, we argue that [the former's willingness to reckon with the
national question is better able to account for the socio-political
significance of national attachment]{.underline}. It [is also better
poised to turn this into a positive resource with which to found a
polity grounded in the principles of equality and justice, negate the
oppressive and dehumanising aspects of colonialism and establish
relationships of parity and mutual recognition]{.underline} between
Palestinians and Jews. [We view bi-nationalism as a multilayered and
complex relational construct. It does recognise difference and Othering
but seeks to view it as productively disruptive]{.underline}. In other
words, it transforms 'otherness' from a problem to be disposed of into a
moral and emotional challenge (e.g. [Bashir and Goldberg,
2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4)).

As an alternative political arrangement, de jure bi-nationalism is not a
new proposition in Palestine/Israel ([Bashir,
2016a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4);
[Farsakh,
2016a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4);
Hermann, 2005a). During the British Mandate in Palestine, marginal
non-statist Zionist groups such as Brit Shalom ('Covenant of Peace') and
Ihud ('Union') opposed partition and called for the creation of a
bi-national state in which the two national groups enjoy equal rights
and representation in a democratically elected council regardless of
their relative size. The aim of these Jewish Zionist advocates of
pre-1948 bi-nationalism was to protect and strengthen the Jewish
minority through granting it national rights and representation equal to
the Arab majority and was likewise rejected by the Palestinians as
settler colonial. While the popularity of bi-nationalism dramatically
declined after 1948, the very different material conditions associated
with the consolidation of the Israeli state, [the collapse of the Oslo
peace process and the ongoing expansion of Israeli settlements in
occupied Palestinian territory have compelled a tiny amount of Israeli
civil society organisations (e.g. [Halper and Ephstain,

the context of decolonisation and Palestinian rights]{.underline} (e.g.

Bi-nationalism diverges most from the liberal one-state paradigm in its
assessment of national identity, as we have mentioned. Whereas
one-staters are more likely to regard nationalism as an oppressive,
violent and volatile force that significantly increases the possibility
of conflict, bi-nationalists adopt a more nuanced perspective wherein
nationalism may be both conservative and progressive depending on
context. Likewise, if one-staters believe that 'nations', as relatively
recent historical inventions, are malleable and open to significant
rearticulation, [bi-nationalists are more inclined to point to the
enduring nature of certain national markers (e.g. language, religion) as
well as the highly affective dimension of national
identity]{.underline}, a divergence that in some ways replicates the
split between 'modernists' and 'primordialists' in nationalism
scholarship ([Busbridge,
2018b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4)).
This naturally has consequences for how resolution is imagined. As
[Woods et al.

6) suggest, a more malleable view of nations as social constructs might
see one favour approaches that foster interethnic cooperation, whereas
[a more enduring view might translate to structural approaches like
consociationalism that seek to protect ethno-national
boundaries]{.underline}. While a context of ethno-national conflict like
the Israeli--Palestinian might make the former a more appealing moral
and ethical vision, it also arguably makes it harder to achieve --
conflicting groups are rarely willing to give up on hard-fought elements
of their identity, the boundaries of which are in turn typically starkly
demarcated (see [Woods et al.,
2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4)).
The argument that Palestinian identity and nationalism have the cultural
and political resources to be inclusive and rights-based rather than
ethnically and religiously based ([Abunimah,
2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032321718767029?icid=int.sj-related-articles.citing-articles.4):

26), for example, appears to presume a path of integration for Israeli
Jews that is hardly accessible after decades of conflict and antagonism.
Certainly, while there were territorially inclusive versions

## Framework 

### 2AC: Solidarity + Gov't Action Key

#### Solidarity AND gov'tal solutions in tandem are uniquely key to breaking down Israeli murders and placing pressure on the colonialist state, Britain shows

**Rizvi 16** ( Husna Rizvi is a New Internationalist staff writer
covering global affairs and has previously written for Prospect
Magazine.
<https://newint.org/features/2018/09/27/freezing-arms-sales-israel-just-first-step>)

**[Solidarity with Palestinians means intervening in Britain's arms
industry]{.underline}**, says War on Want campaigner Ryvka Barnard to a
crowded room at The World Transformed, Momentum's fringe festival at the
Labour Party Conference. **[After the Labour Party accepted a motion to
freeze its arms sales to Israel]{.underline}** this week, campaigners at
the festival urged the party to go one step further and end the trade
all together**[. Even though the government has a licensing criteria
restricting weapons sales to any entity that might use them against
civilians, [£350m worth of military grade hardware has been
sold](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/27/british-arms-exports-israel-new-record)
over the past five years to Israel, despite its [well-documented human
rights
violations.](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/40-dead-5-511-wounded-un-figures-on-casualties-in-gaza-mass-protests-1.6030556)]{.underline}**
Ryvka explains that **[there's no political will in parliament to
enforce those rules]{.underline}**, as complying with them would amount
to a de-facto arms embargo on Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and India.
'Sniper rifles, assault rifles, small arms ammunition, grenade
launchers, pistols... are used daily against Palestinians -- at the
checkpoints, shooting at protestors -- so \[form a\] regular part of the
daily life of what occupation looks like,' she says. 'Other exports
include naval combat vessels that are [used in the shelling of
Gaza](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/revealed-britain-s-role-in-arming-israel-9643902.html)
but also to shoot at Palestinian fisherfolk and destroy their machinery
-- undermining their food security.' Alia Malak, a Palestenian activist
and refugee, said that **[Britain's military support is a natural
consequence of its active and colonial involvement in historic
Palestine. After the First World War, Britain]{.underline}** established
a mandate -- what Hazem Jamjoum, a PhD candidate at NYU calls
'essentially a colony' -- and **[helped political Zionist militias expel
Palestinians from the territories]{.underline}** -- **[70 per cent of
whom have not secured the right to return since 1948]{.underline}**.
'Today, Britain presents itself as an uninvolved observer, when, in
fact, the very same laws which hold Palestinians and their children in
administrative detention without charge, are the same ones established
by the British in 1945,' says Alia. '**[The British are more than
historically complicit. Through these sales, they are actively involved
in the violent occupation of Palestine to this day]{.underline}**,'
Hazem says. Today, he says, **[Britain supports a two-state solution as
a 'fake way to show solidarity' that can't be reconciled with 'the
crucial issue of our right to return']{.underline}**. 'Partition never
works,' he says. Hazem explains that Palestinians don't need a
nation-state per se, but the right to return to their lands from 1948 --
a two state solution, by definition would only guarantee Palestinians
citizenship in a portion of historic Palestine. '**[We're so used to
thinking in terms of national frameworks that our solidarity is framed
in that way too.]{.underline}** Personally, I'm a no-state solution kind
of guy'. A resolution to independently investigate the sale of arms to
Saudi Arabia was defeated in parliament in 2016 after a Saudi coalition
airstrike on a Yemeni funeral [killed at least 140
people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/saudi-led-coalition-admits-to-bombing-yemen-funeral).
Nonetheless, **[Britain continues to supply arms to violent regimes,
under the notion of]{.underline}** what Ryvka calls **['geopolitical
influence' and 'necessary avenues for job creation']{.underline}**.
Despite the recent shift in political will in the Labour Party, the arms
trade shows no sign of slowing down. Ryvka confesses that 'we can't
dismiss the question about jobs' but equally, 'we must create jobs that
don't rely on the destruction of other people's lives.' She says:
'There's a rich conversation happening about how to re-purpose these
factories and re-skill workers in order to work in jobs other than ones
in the arms industry. To think about the literal details like, "What can
this factory make other than parts for drones?" and it could mean
engines for refrigerators. 'It's heartening that this issue is being
picked up by the Labour leadership right now. But **[there are going to
be blocks. Because the way that it's presented to us is though it's a
zero-sum game ­-- either jobs in the arms industry or human rights -- you
choose]{.underline}**. Especially in light of Brexit, it's been
presented to us as though that's the decision and we can say actually
no, there's a different conversation to be had.' Still, that doesn't
address the issue of what Hazem says is 'fundamental' to the Palestine
cause -- the right of return. '**[We are accustomed to a certain mode of
solidarity, which is concerned with showing up to marches only if the
death toll is a high enough number, or else it's too cold outside for it
to be worth it]{.underline}**.' Alia agrees that international interest
and visible public support for the right of return, particularly [during
the Great Return
March](https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2018/05/14/nakba-us-embassy-Jerusalem),
appeared to be waning. She pins this on Britain's anti-terror Prevent
legislation, saying it elicited 'genuine fearfulness from people to
speak publicly about Palestine'. This also follows the Labour Party's
decision to officially adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance definition of anti-Semitism for the purpose of disciplinary
rulings, which defines claims such as 'the state of Israel is a racist
endeavour' as tantamount to the denial of Jewish self-determination.
Speaking of the adoption of the IHRA definition, the Palestine
Solidarity Campaign said: '**[The reality of the Palestinian people's
ongoing dispossession belongs to the public space]{.underline}**:
Palestinian people have the right to impart information about these
present and past injustices, as every British citizen has the right to
hear this information, along with the ideas and arguments that emerge
directly from it.' Despite this controversy, there are '**[multiple
points of intervention both locally and nationally when it comes to
dismantling the arms trade to stand in solidarity with Palestinians,'
Ryvka says. 'Things don't change because politicians just because
suddenly decide to stop selling arms, but because of us, because we
collectively agitate for those outcomes]{.underline}**.'

### Support symbolism reverses thru solidarity

#### The United States presence in Israel is a symbol of support of the violence inflicted by Israelis- Israeli government creates emergencies for recourses that are now not going to the US 

**Bennis 16** (Phyllis Bennis is the director of the New
Internationalism project at the Institute for Policy Studies.
<https://ips-dc.org/record-38-billion-military-aid-israel-statement-absolute-support-israeli-occupation/>)

the Obama administration has said that Israeli's occupation of Palestine
is not sustainable. But it becomes sustainable, Bennis said**[, when the
U.S. finances billions in American tax dollars, "more than has been
given to any other country for military assistanc]{.underline}**e,
including even Iraq in the ten years of the Iraq War, from 2003 to
2011." Bennis called the amount of money "outrageous," for the 23rd
wealtlhiest country in the world. She also said that to call the
stipulation that **[Israel must spend some of the aid on the U.S. war
industry rather than building their own a concession]{.underline}**
"simply doesn't stand up," as that standard applies to all of the other
countries the U.S. provides aid to. As for the provision that Israel is
not to ask for more money unless there's an emergency, Bennis said, "As
we know, **[Israel creates the emergencies. Israel is the one who goes
to war against Gaza and then demands that the U.S. send more bullets
when they use them up, or more planes or more bombs."]{.underline}**
Independent journalist Rania Khalek said it's "stunning" that **[Israel
is prioritized over the interests of Americans during a time when "our
government seems to be incapable of providing basic services in parts of
this country, like clean drinking water and like functioning
schools."]{.underline}** "We're able to always come up with **[this
money to spend to not only enable but literally fund Israel's ongoing
destruction of Palestinian families and communities,"]{.underline}**
Khalek said. This comes at a time when, Khalek said, the current Israeli
government is the most racist government that's been elected in Israel's
history. She said government officials have called for beheadings of
disloyal Palestinians, "ISIS language," and slaughtering mothers in
their beds to prevent them from birthing 'little snakes,' "the language
of genocide." "**[We're arming this government and giving them the
weapons they need to commit absolute savagery against a totally
defenseless population]{.underline}**," Khalek said. Bennis says Obama
is "seriously misreading" where the American people are on the
Palestinian question. "The public discourse on this question has
shifted," she said. "**[There is massive opposition to Israeli actions
in the United States today, particularly importantly in the Jewish
community, where there's been an enormous shift in that
discourse."]{.underline}** Obama has had public confrontations with
Netanyahu, Bennis explained, but **[if the administration continues to
give billions in military aid every year to Israel, and continue to
"provide absolute impunity at the United Nations, using their veto or a
threat of veto or a threat of other punishments to make sure that Israel
is never held accountable for its potential war crimes,]{.underline}**
that's what matters in the U.S.-Israeli relationship, and all the rest
is just words."

### Ethics Impacts Only

#### As a judge, the only thing that should matter to you is ethics. The failure to prioritize ethics results in "value-neutral" educators who don't problematize the things we learn, which only produces technocratic scholars who replicate problematic practices. The aff presents a core set of ethics that we must prioritize

**Kidder 2001**\[Rushworth M., (former professor of English at Wichita
State University), "'There's Only Ethics . . .'", keynote speech
presented to the Human Services Council of Northeast Florida, an
organization of nonprofit entities, in Jacksonville on October 1, 1992.
Revised January 2001 by the Institute for Global Ethics, AX\]

It would appear, then, that there is at least one universal moral
element out there: Culture by culture, people by people, there is
profound agreement that stealing is wrong. That constitutes, it seems,
at least one solid piece of ethical common ground. Yet [much of the
so-called "ethics" taught]{.underline}in the last 30 years [was done in
ignorance]{.underline}of this apparent fact. It was [done under a regime
described by educators as **"values neutral education."**The
teacher]{.underline}, in this regime, [is supposed to have no particular
point of view--to be asort of moral blob who leadsthe students into
"clarifying" their own values withoutin any way suggesting that there
are sets of values that the teacher]{.underline}himself or herself holds
and [operates under, or that are widely accepted as standards. The fact
that we have produced an educational system in which our teachers have
regularly been told that it is not correct for them to take a stand
onsome of those fundamental moral principlessuggests the depth of the
problem we are facing.Yet all is not lost]{.underline}.I remember
talking to [a fifth-grade teacher]{.underline}in Pennsylvania. She [had
shown her students a videotape of]{.underline}the news coverage
of [the riotsfollowing the Rodney King verdict in Los Angeles in
1992. When she askedher students how many]{.underline}of them [would
have broken into storesand stolen stuff]{.underline}if they had been
there, [every hand went up.]{.underline}She was taken aback, but [she
used that moment to engagethem]{.underline}in what she felt was a really
good discussion of property rights, respect for others, and the Golden
Rule. But the point of the story, as she was telling me, was the comment
she made later to her principal. She told him that she was so grateful
that [her school had a character education program that allowed her to
talk about valuesin the classroom]{.underline}--a program that had just
been launched, after full discussion with the community, the year
before. [Why did that matter? ]{.underline}Because, as she said to
him, ["If this had happened in my classroom last year, the only thing I
would have dared to say would have been]{.underline},
"[Well]{.underline}, kids, [if that's the way you
feel]{.underline},let's get out our arithmetic books and talk about
subtraction--because [I'm not allowed to talk about this in
class!" Whatwould have kept her from having that discussion? **The false
notion that you can't teach values because "whose values will you
teach?"**]{.underline}Fortunately, the community had answered that
question for her. They had agreed on a set of core values that is so
widely shared by every culture that they would raise no difficulties if
a teacher worked with it in the classroom. [What's needed, then, is a
recognition that there is a core set of values that can be and must be
taught.]{.underline}What are they? We've found one--the idea of not
stealing. Are there others? Well, what about the Golden Rule?

### Util Bad

#### Util policymaking collapses on itself-justifies countermeasures which end up creating worse impacts

**Weizman 11**(Eyal, Prof of visual and spatial cultures @ Goldsmiths, U
of London, *The Least of All Possible Evils: Humanitarian Violence from
Arendt to Gaza*, p. 8-10)//UM

[The theological origins of the lesser evil argumentcast a long shadow
on the present.]{.underline}In fact [the idiom has become so deeply
ingrained, and is invoked insuch a staggeringly diverse set of contexts
-- from individual situational ethics and international
relations, toattempts to govern the economics of violencein the context
of the 'war on terror' and the efforts of human rights and humanitarian
activists to manoeuvre through the paradoxes of aid -- that it seems to
have altogether taken the place previously reserved for the 'good'.
Moreover, the very evocation of the 'good' seems to everywhere invoke
the utopian tragedies of modernity, in which evil seemed lurking in a
horrible manichaeistic inversion.]{.underline}If no hope is offered in
the future, all that remains is to insure ourselves against the risks
that it poses, to moderate and lessen the collateral effects of
necessary acts, and tend to those who have suffered as a result. [In
relation to the 'war on terror,' the terms of the lesser evil were most
clearly and prominently articulated by**former human rights scholar and
leader of Canada's Liberal Party Michael **Ignatieff]{.underline}. In
his book *The Lesser Evil*, [Ignatieff suggested that in 'balancing
liberty against security' liberal statesestablish mechanisms to regulate
the breach of somehuman rightsand legal norms, and allowtheir security
services to engage in forms of extrajudicial violence -- which he saw as
lesser evils-- in order tofend off or minimize potential greater evils,
such as terror attacks on civilians of western states]{.underline}.11 If
governments need to violate rights in a terrorist emergency, this should
be done, he thought, only as an exception and according to a process of
adversarial scrutiny. '[Exceptions']{.underline}, Ignatieff states, '[do
not destroy the rule but save it, provided that they are temporary,
publicly justified, and deployed as a last resort]{.underline}.'12 [The
lesser evil emergeshere as apragmatistcompromise, a 'tolerated sin' that
functions as thevery justification forthe notion of exception. State
violence inthis model takes part in a necro-economy in which
various types of destructive measure are weighed in a utilitarian
fashion, not only in relation to the damage they produce, but to the
harm they purportedly prevent and even in relation to the more brutal
measures they may help restrain. In this logic, the problem of
contemporary state violence resembles indeed an all-too-human version of
the mathematical minimum problem of the divine calculations previously
mentioned, one tasked with determining the smallest level of violence
necessary to avert the greater harm]{.underline}. For the architects of
contemporary war this balance is trapped between two poles: keeping
violence at a low enough level to limit civilian suffering, and at a
level high enough to bring a decisive end to the war and bring peace.13
More recent works by legal scholars and legal advisers to states and
militaries have sought to extend the inherent elasticity of the system
of legal exception proposed by Ignatieff into ways of rewriting the laws
of armed conflict themselves.14[Lesser evil argumentsare now used
to defendanything from targeted assassinationsand mercy killings, house
demolitions, deportation, torture]{.underline},15 [to the use of
(sometimes) non-lethal chemical weapons, the use of human
shields, andeven 'the intentional targeting of some civilians if it
could save more innocent lives than they cost]{.underline}.'16 [In one
of its more macabre moments it was suggested that the atomic bombingsof
Hiroshima might also be tolerated under the defence of the lesser evil.
Faced with a humanitarian A-bomb, one might wonder what, in fact, might
come under the definition of a greater evil.]{.underline}Perhaps it is
time for the differential accounting of the lesser evil to replace the
mechanical bureaucracy of the 'banality of evil' as the idiom to
describe the most extreme manifestations of violence. Indeed, [it is
through this use of the lesser evil that societies that see themselves
as democratic can maintain regimes of occupation and
neo-colonization]{.underline}. Beyond state agents, those practitioners
of lesser evils, as this book claims, must also include the members of
independent nongovernmental organizations that make up the ecology of
contemporary war and crisis zones. The lesser evil is the argument of
the humanitarian agent that seeks military permission to provide
medicines and aid in places where it is in fact the duty of the
occupying military power to do so, thus saving the military limited
resources. [The lesser evil is often the justification of the military
officer who attempts to administer life (and death) in an 'enlightened'
manner; it is sometimes, too, the brief of the security contractor who
introduces new and more efficient weapons and spatio-technological means
of domination, and advertises them as 'humanitarian technology'. In
these cases the logic of the lesser evil opens up a thick political
field of participation belonging together otherwise opposing fields of
action, to the extent that it might obscure the fundamental moral
differences between these various groups. But, even according tothe
terms of an economy of losses and gains, the conception of the lesser
evil risks becoming counterproductive: less brutal measures are also
those that may be more easily naturalized, accepted and tolerated -- and
hence more frequently used, with the result that a greater evil may be
reachedcumulatively,]{.underline}Such observations amongst other
paradoxes are unpacked in one of the most powerful challenges to ideas
such as Ignatieff's -- Adi Ophir's philosophical essay *The Order of
Evils*. In this book [Ophir developed an ethical system that is
similarly not grounded in a search for the 'good' but the systemic logic
of an economy of violence -- the possibility of a lesser means and the
risk of more damage -- but insists that questions of violence are
forever unpredictable and will always escape the capacity to calculate
them. Inherent in Ophir's insistence on the necessity of calculating is,
he posits, the impossibility of doing so. The demand of his ethics are
grounded in this impossibility]{.underline}.17

#### Discourse over large scale impacts directly trades off with focus on structural issues

**[Jackson 12]{.underline}** Director of the National Centre for Peace
and Conflict Studies, the University of Otago. Former. Professor of
International Politics at Aberystwyth University (8/5/12, Richard, The
Great Con of National Security,

national-security/) EL

It may have once been the case that being attacked by another country
was a major threat to the lives of ordinary people. It may also be true
that there are still some pretty serious dangers out there associated
with the spread of nuclear weapons. For the most part, however**[, [most
of what you've been told about national security and all the big
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** which can supposedly kill you **[[is one
big con designed to distract you from the things that can really hurt
you]{.mark}, s[uch as the poverty, inequality and structural
violence]{.mark} of capitalism, global warming, and the manufacture and
proliferation of weapons]{.underline}** -- among others.

The facts are simple and irrefutable: you're far more likely to die from
lack of health care provision than you are from terrorism; from stress
and overwork than Iranian or North Korean nuclear missiles; from lack of
road safety than from illegal immigrants; from mental illness and
suicide than from computer hackers; from domestic violence than from
asylum seekers; from the misuse of legal medicines and alcohol abuse
than from international drug lords. And yet, **[[politicians]{.mark} and
the servile media [spend most of their time]{.mark} talking
[about]{.mark}]{.underline}** the threats posed by terrorism,
immigration, asylum seekers, the international drug trade, the nuclear
programmes of Iran and North Korea, computer hackers, animal rights
activism, [the threat of
China](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-model-for-a-future-war-fans-tensions-with-china-and-inside-pentagon/2012/08/01/gJQAC6F8PX_story.html?wpisrc=emailtoafriend),
and a host of other issues which are all about as equally unlikely to
affect the health and well-being of you and your family. Along with this
obsessive and perennial discussion of **[so-called 'national security
issues', [the state spends truly vast sums on security measures which
have]{.mark} [[virtually no impact]{.mark} on the
actual](http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=7.1.16) risk of dying from
these threats, and then engages in massive displays of 'security
theatre' designed to show just how seriously the state takes these
threats --]{.underline}** such as the x-ray machines and security
measures in every public building, surveillance cameras everywhere,
missile launchers in urban areas, drones in Afghanistan, armed police in
airports, and a thousand other things. This display is meant to convince
you that these threats are really, really serious.

And while all this is going on, the **[[rulers]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
society **[[are hoping that you won't notice that increasing social and
economic inequality in society]{.mark}]{.underline}** leads to increased
ill health for a growing underclass; that suicide and crime always rise
when unemployment rises; that workplaces remain highly dangerous and
kill and maim hundreds of people per year; that **[there are
[preventable diseases]{.mark} which plague the poorer sections of
society; that [domestic violence]{.mark} kills and injures thousands of
women and children annually; and that globally, [poverty]{.mark} and
preventable disease kills tens of millions of people needlessly every
year]{.underline}**. In other words, they are hoping that you won't
notice how much [structural
violence](http://www.structuralviolence.org/structural-violence) there
is in the world.

More than this, **[[they are hoping that you won't notice that while
literally trillions of dollars are spent on military weapons]{.mark},
foreign wars and security theatre]{.underline}** (which also arguably do
nothing to make any us any safer, and may even make us marginally less
safe), that domestic violence programmes struggle to provide even
minimal support for women and children at risk of serious harm from
their partners; that underfunded mental health programmes mean long
waiting lists to receive basic care for at-risk individuals; that drug
and alcohol rehabilitation programmes lack the funding to match the
demand for help; **[that [welfare measures aimed at reducing inequality
have been inadequate for decades]{.mark}; that health and safety
measures at many workplaces remain insufficiently
resourced]{.underline}**; and that measures to tackle global warming and
developing alternative energy remain hopelessly inadequate.

The problem of the second method is that it is very difficult to
\"calculate\" politically unacceptable losses. If the riskof
terrorism is defined in traditional terms by**[probability
andpotential loss]{.underline}**, then the focusondramaticterror attacks
leads to **[the marginalization of probabilities]{.underline}**. The
reason is that even the highest degree of improbability becomes
irrelevant asthe measure of loss goes to infinity.50 The mathematical
calculationof the risk of terrorism thus tends to overestimate and to
dramatize the danger. This has consequences beyond the actual risk
assessment for the formulation and execution of \"risk policies\": If
one factor of the risk calculation approaches infinity(e.g., if a case
of nuclear terrorism is envisaged), then there is no balanced measure
forantiterrorist efforts, and risk management as a rational endeavor
breaks down. Under the historical con- dition of bipolari ty, the
\"ultimate\" threat with nuclear weapons could be balanced by a similar
counterthreat, and new equilibria could be achieved, albeit on higher
levels of nuclear overkill. Under thenew condition of uncertainty,
nosuch rational balancing is possible since knowledge about actors,
their motives and capabilities, is largely absent. The second form
of security policythat emerges when the deterrence model collapses
mirrors the \"social probability\" approach. It **[represents a logic of
catastrophe]{.underline}**. In contrast torisk management framed in line
with logical probability theory, the logic of catastrophe does not
attempt to provide means of absorbing uncertainty. Rather, it takes
uncertainty as constitutive for the logic itself; uncertainty is a
crucial precondition for catastrophes. In particular, catastrophes
happen at once, without a warning, but with major implicationsfor the
world polity. In this category, we find the impact of meteorites, Mars
attacks, the tsunami in South East Asia, and 9/11. To conceive of
terrorism ascatastrophe has consequences for the formulation of an
adequate security policy. Since catastrophes happen**[irrespectively of
human activity]{.underline}**or inactivity, **[nopolitical action
couldpossibly prevent them.]{.underline}**Of course, there are
precautions that can be taken, but the framing ofterrorist attack as
a catastrophe points to spatial and temporal characteristics that are
beyond \"rationality.\"Thus, political **[decision makers are exempted
from]{.underline}**the **[responsibility]{.underline}**to provide
security - as long as they at least try to preempt an
attack.Interestingly enough, 9/11 was framed as catastro- phe in various
commissions dealing with the question of who was responsible and whether
it could have been prevented. This makes clear that under the condition
of uncertainty, there are no objective criteria that could serve as an
anchor for measur- ing dangers and assessing the quality of political
responses. For ex- ample, as much as one might object to certain
measures by the US administration,it is almost impossible to \"measure\"
the success of countermeasures.Of course, there might be a subjective
assessment of specific shortcomings or failures, but there is no
\"common\" cur- rency to evaluate them. As a consequence, the framework
of the securitydilemma fails tocapturethe **[basic
uncertainties]{.underline}**. Pushing the door open for the security
paradox, **[themain problem]{.underline}**of security analysis
then **[becomes]{.underline}**the question **[how to integrate
dangers]{.underline}**in risk assessments and security policies **[about
which simply nothing is known]{.underline}**. In the mid 1990s, a Rand
study entitled \"New Challenges for Defense Planning\" addressed this
issue arguing that \"most striking is the fact that we do not even know
who or what will constitute the most serious future threat.\"51 In order
to cope with this challenge it would beessential, another Rand
researcher wrote, to break free fromthe \"tyranny\" of plausible
scenario planning. The decisive step would be to create
\"**[discontinuous scenarios]{.underline}**\... in which there is**[no
plausibleaudit trailor storyline from current events]{.underline}**\"52
These nonstandard scenarios were later called \"wild cards\" and became
important in the current US strategic discourse. They justified the
transformation from a threat-based toward a capability- based defense
planning strategy.53 The problem with this kind of risk assessment is,
however, that **[even the most absurd scenarioscan gain
plausibility]{.underline}**. By constructing a chain of
potentialities,improbable events are**[linked]{.underline}**and brought
into the realm of thepossible, if not even
the **[probable]{.underline}**. \"Although the likelihood of the
scenario dwindles with each step, the residual impression is one of
plausibility.\"54 This so-called Othello effect has been effective in
the dawn of the recent war in Iraq. The connection between Saddam
Hussein and AI Qaeda that the US government tried to prove was disputed
from the very beginning. False evidence was again and again presented
and refuted, but this did not prevent the administration from presenting
as the main rationale for war the improbable yet possible connection
between Iraq and the terrorist network and the improbable yet possible
proliferation of an improbable yet possible nuclear weapon into the
hands of Bin Laden. As Donald Rumsfeld famously said: \"**[Absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence.]{.underline}**\" This sentence
indicates that under the condition of genuine uncertainty, different
evidence criteria prevail than in situations where security problems can
be assessed with relative certainty.

### Land Connection xt

#### Solidarity promotes land connection and erases invented settler imaginaries on the land's history. This is key to destroying settler-colonialism

**Tabar & Desai 17** (Linda Tabar is a Visiting Assistant Professor in
International Studies at Trinity College. Situated in the field of
anti-colonial, anti-racist feminist scholarship, her work focuses on
settler colonialism. Dr. Chandni Desai is an Assistant Professor in the
Equity Studies Program at the University of Toronto.)

**[decolonization is about imagining modes of life and futures that are
rooted in indigenous Palestinian epistemologies, memory and relations to
land, place and the body]{.underline}**, and not solely just about
replacing the colonial state and racial economy. Our contributors
emphasize **[the centrality of land and memory in this
process.]{.underline}** In his interview, Jamal Juma', **[describes how
Palestinians living relationship to the land underpins the way they put
their bodies on the line on the frontier spaces that the settler state
attempt(ed)(s) to clear and eliminate Palestinians from.]{.underline}**
He describes how a Palestinian peasant, Abu Nidal, whose land was being
confiscated by Israeli occupation forces, began to speak the land during
a direct action, while simultaneously mocking the settlers inability to
comprehend the living relationship Palestinians have to land. **[For
many Palestinians, solidarity is not only limited to political
relationships with other movements, but it is also expressed to the
land. It is through protecting, knowing and taking care of the land that
some Palestinians]{.underline}** like Abu Nidal and Jamal Juma' **[enact
solidarity with the land, and teach future generations of that
responsibility.]{.underline}** It is these embodied ties and practices
of resistance that enable Palestinians to enact a decolonial process on
a daily basis, one that constructs a present and a future beyond settler
sovereignty and the "imagined geography" (Said, 1978) that it imposes on
the land1. **[The reproduction of the Zionist settler colonial
enterprise depends on the ongoing erasure of Palestinian geographies,
culture, history and life on the land, via replacement with the settler
imaginary. It is for this reason that Palestinian embodied practices,
living ties to place and presence on the land are such powerful forms of
resistance]{.underline}**. They invoke the anxieties of the settler
colonizers and destabilizes their mythologies and claims to land.
Palestinian memory also plays a significant role in rupturing the
colonizer's ideology and the material edifice of the settler colonial
project. More importantly, in the midst of this continued dismemberment,
memory mends, repairs and keeps alive relations to place and enables a
continuity of history, culture and future. These living memories - in
storytelling, resistance culture, daily transmissions and texts - are
part of Palestinian worldviews that articulate decolonization through
their intellectual and political traditions beyond the colonial system
and its ideological apparatus.

**[a two-state solution rests on the idea that national
self-determination is best expressed territorially in the form of a

understandings of decolonisation as a moment of
transition[4](javascript:popRef('fn4-0032321718767029')) from foreign
rule and occupation to constitutional independence. **[From this
perspective, the decolonising appeal of a two-state solution is
clear]{.underline}**. As much as it represents a limiting of Palestinian
territorial aspirations, as a compromise it allows for a relatively
defined shift to a self-determining polity, where Palestinian national
symbols would find state-based expression. **[However, several scholars
have argued that the salience of the colonial paradigm drastically
declined post-1993, with mainstream Palestinian political and scholarly
discourse largely concerned with state-building and economic development

its associated two states instead maintain colonial structures of
domination, inequalities and dispossession while enforcing neoliberal
policies and promoting the illusion of post-conflict parity and

### AT: Intervening Actors

#### Intervening actors response to the plan does not make us responsible for negative impacts-it obscures ethics and is used to silence progressive movements

**Gewirth 83 **(Alan, philosopher, Human Rights: Essays on Justification
and Applications, p 230-231)

A third distinction is between respecting other persons and avoiding bad
consequences.  [Respect for persons isan obligation so
fundamentalthat it cannot be overriddeneven to prevent evil
consequences]{.underline}from befalling some persons.  [If such
prevention requiresan action whereby respectis withheld from persons,
then that action must not be performed, whatever the
consequences]{.underline}. One of the difficulties with this important
distinction is that it is unclear.  [May not respect be withheld from a
person by failing to avert]{.underline}from him [some evil
consequence?]{.underline}  How can Abrams be held to respect the
thousands of innocent persons or their rights if he lets them die when
he could have prevented this? The distinction also fails to provide for
degrees of moral urgency.  One fails to respect a person if one lies to
him or steals from him; but sometimes the only way to prevent the death
of one innocent person may be by stealing from or telling a lie to some
other innocent person.  [In such a case, respect for oneperson may lead
to disrespect of a more serious kind from some otherinnocent
person]{.underline}. 7. None of the above distinctions, then, serves its
intended purpose of defending the absolutist against the
consequentialist.  They do not show that the son's refusal to tortures
his mother to death does not violate the other persons' rights to life
and that hes is not morally responsible for their deaths.  Nevertheless,
the distinctions can be supplemented in a way that does serve to
establish these conclusions.  [The required supplement isprovided by the
principle of the intervening action]{.underline}.  According to this
principle, [when there is a causal connection between some
person]{.underline}A['sperforming some ]{.underline}**action(or
inaction**[)]{.underline}X [and some
otherperson]{.underline}C's [incurring a certain harm]{.underline}Z,
A's [moral responsibility]{.underline}for Z [is removed if]{.underline},
between X and Z, [there intervenes some other action]{.underline}Y of
some person B who knows the relevant circumstances of his action and who
intends to produce Z or show produces Z through recklessness. [The
reasons for this removal is that B's intervening
action]{.underline}Y [is the moredirect or proximate
cause]{.underline}of Z [and]{.underline}, unlike A's action (or
inaction), Y [is the sufficient condition]{.underline}of Z as it
actually occurs. An example of this principle may help to show its
connection with the absolutist
thesis.  [MartinLuther King]{.underline}Jr. [was repeatedly toldthat
because he led demonstrations in support of civil rights, he was morally
responsible forthe disorders, riots, and deaths that
ensued]{.underline}and that were shaking the American Republic to its
foundations.  [Bythe principle of the intervening action, however, it
was King's opponents who were responsiblebecause their intervention
operated as the sufficient conditions of the riots and injuries.  King
might also have replied that the Republic would not be worth saving if
the price that had to be paid was the violation of the civil rights of
black Americans.  As for the rights of the other Americans to peace and
order, the reply would be that these rights cannot justifiably be
secured at the price of the rights of blacks.]{.underline}

#### Plan focus is good \-\-- theorizing subversion of settler technologies is historically successful and necessary for decolonization

Even When They Are Dangerous

**[Everywhere land resists]{.underline}** and refuses---whales that
destroy ships, bees that refuse to work, bombed islands that
reconstitute themselves. The land also resists in the form of people;
**[Indigenous peoples' resistance is the land's resistance. Indigenous
people continue to subvert legal and capitalist technologies as part of
that resistance. And technologies and technological beings resist
too.]{.underline}**

**[Patent law is patently designed to favor corporations,]{.underline}**
a legal technology whose colonizing functions are particularly evident
when considering how **[Monsanto and other GMO producing giants are
patenting seeds and genes they "find" throughout the
world.]{.underline}** Yet **[Indigenous communities are fighting this
biopiracy by refusing the systems that permit corporations to patent
life]{.underline}** and that document knowledge for expropriation in the
first place, by creating digital libraries of traditional knowledges,
and sometimes **[by subverting patent law to claim rights to their own
life worlds and knowledges]{.underline}**.\[35\]

**[Treaties are technologies of colonial coercion and yet also of
Indigenous survivance]{.underline}**. As Scott Lyon says, an x-mark that
signs **[the treaty "is a sign of consent in a context of
coercion]{.underline}**. . . . And yet **[there is always the
possibility of slippage, indeterminacy, unforeseen consequences, or
unintended results; it is always possible]{.underline}**, that is,
**[that an x-mark could result in something good]{.underline}**. Why
else, we must ask, would someone bother to make it?"\[36\] Since 1948,
**[the Oneida Indian Nation has pursued restoration of
sovereignty]{.underline}** over historical reservation lands
**[via]{.underline}** a complex set of avenues involving **[treaty
law]{.underline}**, U.S. **[courts, casinos, and excise taxes, resulting
in a landmark 13,004 acres of land taken into trust]{.underline}** by
the Department of the Interior in 2014.\[37\]

Sometimes **[settlers return land to Indigenous tribes and
nations]{.underline}**. Hopefully, they/we might do so without
conditions. As I write, **[the Kashia Band of Pomo Indians are getting
back 688 acres of coastal lands]{.underline}** in California.\[38\] I am
not saying wealthy settlers who return land are decolonizing. I am
saying that some **[colonizing technology has been
hotwired]{.underline}**; something scyborg is happening.

**[The]{.underline}** truth is that any **[return of land]{.underline}**
is not just due to the good graces and benevolence of wealthy settlers;
it **[is a scyborg possibility foretold by an x-mark]{.underline}**.
About Hollywood star Johnny Depp's purported promise to buy land for
Comanche, Sonny Skyhawk, a Sicangu Lakota actor and founder of American
Indians in Film and Television, said, "If it's from the heart, we accept
it. If it's not from the heart, we'll accept it anyways."\[39\]

Developed as weapons of surveillance and assassination, drones are hard
to imagine as decolonizing instruments; yet these machines we hate may
serve a function before we discard them. Originally a wind-powered
device similar to the childhood wind toys of its Afghani creator Massoud
Hassani, the Mine Kafon drone "can autonomously map, detect, and
detonate land mines" and could contribute to demilitarizing mine-filled
lands within a generation.\[40\] Dynamite, which left Alfred Nobel rich
and many dead, and which abetted in U.S. westward imperial expansion,
blew up the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams and restored the Elwha
River.\[41\] A giant, autonomous artificial coastline could assist the
ocean to clean herself of the great Pacific Garbage Patch.\[42\] Oysters
made "plantable" by farming technologies detoxify the Hudson and so
become too poisonous to eat, but because of them, the frogs will
return.\[43\] Wind-powered strandbeests---originally devised to restore
Dutch beaches---now roam almost autonomous, almost free.\[44\] Toxic and
explosive and wind-willed machine animals, you, scyborg, might read
about and feel some odd sense of recognition.

**[Figure out how technologies operate]{.underline}**. Use a wrench.
**[Technologies can be disrupted and reorganized]{.underline}**---at
least for a machine cycle. **[Rather than thinking of ourselves as just
subjects of those technologies, think about how]{.underline}** we are
the drones, the explosives, the toxified, the operative parts of those
technologies---and ideally, how **[we might operate on]{.underline}**
ourselves and other **[technologies and turn these gears into
decolonizing operations.]{.underline}**

cannot ignore Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and blockade
of [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza) where a combined

appears to be a creeping annexation]{.underline}**. **[In America, views

which revealed that **[79% of Republicans say their sympathies lie more

of Democrats are more sympathetic to Israel.]{.underline}** [Another
study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/)
revealed that, while a large majority of Democrats see Israel as a
strategic asset, **[55% of Democrats also see Israel as a strategic
burden,]{.underline}** and **[60% of Democrats believe the United States
should impose sanctions or take serious action in response to Israeli

illustrates the partisan divide. **[In 2015 there was a Democratic

and American rightwing parties was reinforced by Netanyahu's recent

supposedly showing Iran's previous nuclear ambitions, which was just
days later
[referenced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-speech-iran-deal.html)
by Donald Trump as justification for violating the deal. The same goes
for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump is backing Netanyahu's
government with hardly a critical word of Israeli activity towards the
Palestinians. The embassy move is a case in point -- it gains nothing
for the United States, makes it impossible for the Palestinians to view
this administration as a neutral mediator for peace talks, and stoked
violence. Israel has genuine security concerns, and the second intifada
left deep scars on the Israeli psyche. For Israelis who remember
wondering each day if their children were going to be killed by a
suicide bomber on the way to school, **[the occupation allows Israelis
to keep the Palestinians out of sight and out of mind.]{.underline}**
This is no small part of the reason why rightwing parties promising But
**[Israel cannot remain a democracy in the long run while continuing to
rule millions of Palestinians who do not have any say in their

Israel is good at solving short-term problems -- say, protecting Israeli
settlers -- it is not good at figuring out long-term solutions, like
preventing Israel from becoming a perpetual occupier. As one Israeli
journalist told me in response to a discussion of the myriad challenges
facing Israel, "we'll schlep through"]{.underline}**. Surely, the
US-Israel relationship will also schlep through -- but what kind of
relationship will it be? On my trip, I repeatedly heard the claim that
fewer American Jews support Israel because they are moving away from
[Judaism](https://www.theguardian.com/world/judaism), not because of
Israeli policies towards Palestinians. As an American Jew who strongly
supports Israel, but not necessarily Israel's policies, this deeply
offended me. Instead of criticizing American Jews for how they choose to
live their personal lives, Israelis should recognize that, whatever the
reason, falling support for Israel among a younger generation of
American Jews will fracture the US-Israel relationship. security have
run Israel for almost two decades now. Fueling the fire in America are
radicals such as [Sheldon

who funds the largest Israeli daily newspaper "Israel Today" to support
a rightwing agenda, and who has
[offered](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/23/republican-donor-sheldon-adelson-jerusalem-embassy/366223002/)
to pay for the new US embassy in Jerusalem. The Trump administration

speakers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/robert-jeffress-pastor-us-embassy-embassy-donald-trump-mitt-romney)

"Mormonism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism -- they lead people to an eternity
of separation from God in hell." There are no obvious perfect solutions.
But if the United States and Israel don't work together to confront
longer-term trends, the relationship could become unrecognizable, with a
hyper-partisan segment of America supporting an Israel that has lost
much of its claim to democracy. And that would be devastating for both
countries.

Against the plethora of concerns stimulated by the persecution of Jewish
people, particularly under Tsarist rule in Russia, **[Zionism emerged as
a political philosophy that demanded for Jews the right to national
self-determination]{.underline}**. Zionism was first developed as a
coherent political philosophy by Theodor Herzl in The Jewish state (Der
Judenstaat) (1896). **[According to Herzl's proposal]{.underline}**, the
Jewish people's bond with the land of Palestine was sui generis, the
Arab inhabitants of Palestine were not a separate nation but part of a
greater Arab nation, and **[the Jewish people had a historical right to
Palestine whereas the indigenous Arab population had mere residential
rights]{.underline}** (Finkelstein 1995, 14). Herzl's plan was followed
by a gradual continuous migration (aliyah) of the Jews to Palestine,
which was heightened with the Nazi regime's systematic persecution of
Jews in Germany and elsewhere in Europe during World War II. Just after
the end of the British Mandate Administration, on 14 May 1948, the
establishment of a Jewish state, to be known as the State of Israel, was
declared. Th**[e Israeli proclamation claims explicit international
recognition for the historic connection of the Jewish people with
Palestine and their right to reconstitute their national
home.]{.underline}** **[As with the general Zionist approach to
Palestinian Arabs during the 1930s, the founders of the State of Israel
also ignored Palestinian Arabs' claims,]{.underline}** but by offering
this olive branch attempted to convince them to give up their claims for
independence. **[The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948
brought about the issue of political security]{.underline}**. **[Within
this context, the 1948 Arab -- Israeli war in particular,]{.underline}**
and Arab hostilities against Israel in general, **[drew the contours of
the Israeli security discourse. Particularly the establishment of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and its leaders'
statements]{.underline}** underlining the impossibility of the
recognition of, and coexistence with, the State of Israel **[paved the
way for the Zionist securitization of the Palestinian Arabs as a threat
to the political security of the State of Israel]{.underline}**. Besides
the Palestinians' insistence on the incompatibility between the
statehood claims of the Jews in Palestine and the Palestinian Arabs'
rights, Palestinian leaders' securitization of the issue of Palestinian
refugees constituted the main themes of the Israeli security discourse.
For a long time, **[Israeli governments tried to deal with the
Palestinian refugee problem that emerged after the 1948 war based on the
assumption that as Palestinians formed a part of a larger entity, Arab
or Syrian, they could be absorbed into the surrounding Arab
countries.]{.underline}** **[From the initial days of Zionism, Zionists
considered the existence of Palestinian Arabs as something to be
avoided, or denied.]{.underline}** **[A distinct Palestinian Arab entity
was not accepted by the Zionist leadership. As claimed in the
traditional Zionist narrative, Israel had no active responsibility for
the Palestinian refugee problem during the 1948 war. By launching the
war and by encouraging Palestinians to leave, it was the Arabs who were
responsible for the refugee issue. According to this claim, since
Palestinians left voluntarily because of the war, Israel has no moral or
practical responsibility for the consequent situation]{.underline}**. As
Michal Ben-Josef Hirsch argues, **[this narrative prevailed in the
political and historical arguments from 1948 until the 1990s and any
counter-narrative was considered taboo]{.underline}** (Hirsch 2007,
242). **[As was experienced in the pre-1990 Israeli security discourse,
taboo subjects are avoided and they are beyond societal debate. In
Israel, the taboo status of the Palestinian]{.underline}** **[refugee
problem helped set the terms of the security discourse and the
boundaries of identity. In general, a taboo is avoided because it is
securitized as dangerous and threatening.]{.underline}** **[In the
Palestinian refugees' case, the repatriation of Palestinian refugees
poses a threat to Israel, since the return of a large number of
Palestinians would change the demographic balance and threaten the
Jewish character of the State of Israel]{.underline}**. **[Hence, the
return of Palestinian refugees was not acceptable under any
conditions]{.underline}** (Frid 2001, 12). As discussed here,
**[Israel's existential predicament is rooted in its pursuit of life and
liberty among the predatory Arab--Muslim environs, which is something
reinforced by historical narrative.]{.underline}** **[The Zionist
national historical narrative is rooted in the goals of the Zionist
movement]{.underline}**. **[A crucial aspect of the Zionist movement
is]{.underline}** to link Jewish national revival to the historic nation
in Eretz Israel (Zerubavel 1995, 17 --22; Kimmerling 1995), **[the
promise of 'a land with no people for the people with no
land']{.underline}** based on the early Zionist scholars' claims. For
example, **[the empty land and the nuisance of the Arab populations of
Palestine were portrayed by Herzl in Altneuland2]{.underline}** (2007
\[1902\]). **[Similarly, the notion of the 'few against many' along with
the perception of 'a nation under siege' became major elements in the
Israeli security discourse.]{.underline}** In spite of Israel's victory,
**[Zionist leadership interpreted Israel as the victim of the
Arab]{.underline}** **[-- Israeli wars]{.underline}**. Speaking of the
1948 and the 1967 wars, the early **[Zionist authors]{.underline}** and
contemporary Zionists, such as Michael Oren (1992) and Avraham Sela
(1998), **[have all presented Israel as the victim of acute strategic
insecurity. The Arab -- Israeli wars were interpreted as wars by a
united Arab front against Israel which aimed at tightening the Arab
siege against Israel and posed a threat to Israel's very existence (Sela
1998). As discussed throughout this section, the Israeli national ethos
that was recreated by Israeli Zionist historians and the official
Israeli accounts of the Arab and/or Palestinian Arab threat to the
existence of Israel mutually reinforced each other and drew the contours
of the Israeli securitization of the Palestinian national
movement]{.underline}**. **[Both through official statements and the
works of Zionist authors, a historical narrative that reinforced the
security discourse to securitize the Palestinians as a threat was
created.]{.underline}** On the other hand, Arab historians and other
scholars who have written Palestinian points of view addressed the same
events and issues from a totally different perspective.
