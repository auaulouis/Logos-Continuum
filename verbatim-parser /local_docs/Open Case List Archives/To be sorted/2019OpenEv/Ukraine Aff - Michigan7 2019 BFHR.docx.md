#### US sales to Ukraine cause an [escalatory spiral]{.underline} of commitments with [zero battlefield]{.underline} benefit \-\-- only a [prohibition on lethal arms sales]{.underline} solves

America's recent decision to authorize the sale and delivery of Javelin
anti-tank missile systems to Ukraine was shortsighted and dangerous to
all parties involved.\[1\] The provision of the Javelin weapons system,
in particular, serves as little more than a symbolic gesture. In the
end, the authorization will likely prove a maneuver in optics, not
strategy. Furthermore, recent developments suggest the Ukrainian
government, in an effort to secure the deal, may have interfered with
the ongoing special counsel investigation in the United States.\[2\] The
following delineates the reasoning behind this conclusion, puts forward
some of the stronger arguments in favor of the authorization, and
describes why they are misguided. [Amid the fraught U.S.-Russia
relations of late, it is vital for American policymakers to consider
each geopolitical decision with the utmost care]{.underline}, ensuring
the best interests of the United States and her allies are always kept
in mind.\[3\] [An **appropriate policy** would include **forgoing any
further sale of lethal weaponry**]{.underline}, [replacing it instead
with]{.underline} increased [funds and]{.underline} non-lethal [materiel
such as]{.underline} counter-electronic warfare ([EW]{.underline})
technology [and]{.underline} the deployment of additional [troops on a
strictly train-and-advise basis]{.underline}. The conflict in Eastern
Ukraine has claimed over 10,000 lives and forced over a million more to
flee their homes.\[4\] Taking these figures into consideration, it is
evident that decisive action is necessary; thus far, however, the United
States has taken the wrong approach. [Arming Ukraine]{.underline} with
Javelin anti-tank missiles [runs the risk of reigniting what has become
a relatively static engagement between the Ukrainian Army and
Russian-backed separatists]{.underline}.\[5\] Skirmishes occur on a
daily basis, and casualties continue to accrue, but [a sudden injection
of Western munitions into the hands of the Ukrainian Army is likely to
prompt a disproportionate response from the side of the Russians, a
reaction not without historical precedence]{.underline}.\[6\] Assuming
the Russians respond not in kind, but with asymmetric force, where does
that leave the United States? Is the United States to perpetually
provide [bigger and better arms]{.underline} as the process [persists
in]{.underline} [some]{.underline} sort of [vicious]{.underline}
iteration of Robert Jervis's [spiral]{.underline} model?\[7\] For now,
Russia has far more at stake in this conflict. With his population's
support and at least six more years at the helm, Vladimir [Putin can and
will broaden his country's efforts in the region if need
be]{.underline}.\[8\] [Even if the United States were committed to meet
every response with more firepower, the Russians have the overwhelming
advantage of geography]{.underline}. Russia's shared border with
Ukraine, one that is reportedly near-impossible to effectively monitor,
enables expedited resupplies.\[9\] Putin's relative autonomy in terms of
foreign policy decisions also adds to the potential for a rapid
response. Furthermore, [it is prudent to consider how Ukrainians may
interpret the signaling of receiving lethal arms from
America]{.underline}. [Inspired by the renewed and augmented support of
the Americans, this move could embolden Ukrainians to begin launching
assaults, thus producing an **avoidable escalation
scenario**]{.underline}. Many like to frame the conversation as
providing so-called defensive weapons rather than offensive, but in
reality, there is no logical distinction between the two.\[10\] [The
Ukrainians using these weapons to go on an offensive, making the U.S. an
indirect accomplice in violating the Minsk Agreement, remains a real
possibility and a real concern]{.underline} of those monitoring the
situation closely.\[11\] [From a purely practical standpoint, providing
Ukraine with Javelins makes little sense]{.underline}. While the
provision of such weapons would certainly generate substantial
repercussions due to the symbolism of the action, their usefulness on
the battlefield would be virtually imperceptible. In fact, former
commander of U.S. Army Europe remarked in 2015 that the Ukrainian Army
having Javelin missiles "would not change the situation strategically in
a positive way."\[12\] Ukraine has no need for Javelin missiles, as it
already produces its own comparable varieties of anti-tank
weaponry.\[13\] [The Ukrainian Army is well-equipped for situations that
require anti-tank capabilities, thus it is redundant]{.underline} to
provide them with more. [Furthermore, the conflict has largely steered
away from tank warfare]{.underline}, further highlighting the
superfluity of Javelin sales.\[14\] [The provision of other lethal arms
in general is similarly excessive]{.underline}. Since the outbreak of
the conflict, the Ukrainian Army has improved its capabilities in almost
every aspect of warfare by orders of magnitude. Ukraine's current air,
land, and sea means are unrecognizable in comparison to those of
2014.\[15\] If anything, the United States should be increasing support
to help Ukraine counter the innovative electronic warfare the
Russian-backed separatists are waging in the east.\[16\] An electronic
warfare package would be immensely more advantageous to the effort in
Ukraine. The package could include products such as the THOR III, CREW
jammer, or MODI II systems, as well as a contingent of U.S. electronic
warfare specialists to train Ukrainian soldiers using a strategy akin to
the one released by the Pentagon in 2017.\[17\] This recent Department
of Defense approach lays emphasis on the integration of burgeoning
electronic warfare capabilities throughout the gamut of military
operations, the use of cost-effective technology in lieu of conventional
arms, and the coordination of preparedness training for the rigors of
conflict in the electromagnetic spectrum.\[18\] These systems, among
others, could make a genuine difference in an electronic warfare space
currently dominated by the Russians.\[19\] As an added benefit,
Ukrainian troops could later be debriefed by their American counterparts
on how the technology fared in real-world application against the
current leader in electronic warfare tactics, providing valuable insight
to be used in future strategic planning. To further assist, the United
States could take the advice of a February 2018 Carnegie report, which
suggests the problem the Ukrainian Army faces now is not one of
hardware, but of structure, and a key component of successful reform is
the expansion of Western training efforts.\[20\] It is also imperative
to acknowledge the likelihood of American-made weapons systems winding
up in the hands other than those for whom they were intended. Time and
again, U.S.-supplied weapons are either stolen from the anticipated
beneficiary or never make it there in the first place. In just the last
decade, this happened in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia,
Yemen, and Mexico.\[21\] In Ukraine, the worry would be that the
Javelins provided by America could make their way into the arms of
either some sort of extremist Ukrainian militia such as the Azov
Battalion or the very same Russian-backed separatists the weapons were
meant to combat.\[22\] The Ukrainian Army has lost control of countless
weapons that have then found their way onto the streets and online
marketplaces.\[23\] In one instance, Ukrainian Army vehicles were taken
by separatists in broad daylight and subsequently paraded about.\[24\]
More importantly, non-lethal U.S. military equipment, such as
mortar-tracking radar technology given to Ukraine in 2015, was stolen by
the separatists not long after delivery.\[25\] Assuming such a risk with
lethal weaponry is needless and should, under present circumstances, be
avoided. [The advocates of arming Ukraine cite a number of
well-intentioned]{.underline}, [yet]{.underline} nebulous and, in some
cases, [erroneous motives for their position.]{.underline} [The primary
argument is that the United States must support the independence of a
democratic, potential future NATO member]{.underline}.\[26\] [The
problem with this particular belief is that the United States is and has
been supporting the independence of Ukraine for
years]{.underline}.\[27\] [Since the outset of the conflict, the United
States has provided over \$1.3 billion in monetary assistance, training,
and non-lethal materiel such as radar, surveillance, and
vehicles]{.underline}.\[28\] As argued above, [there is no practical
need for the provision of lethal arms, so the support for Ukrainian
independence is, in effect, being realized]{.underline}. [Another
argument for arming Ukraine is that doing so strengthens NATO; however,
one can argue persuasively that Ukraine is doing just fine without
American anti-tank missiles]{.underline}.\[29\] [In the same vein as the
strengthening NATO argument, champions for the arming of Ukraine insist
that lethal arms from America will enhance European
security]{.underline}. **[European allies of the United States tend to
have a different opinion]{.underline}**.\[30\] [Representatives of
countries located within Europe]{.underline}, such as the former
president of France, Francois Hollande; German Chancellor, Angela
Merkel; and U.K. national security official, Mark Sedwell, [have
publicly stated their qualms with a U.S.-provided lethal arms package,
echoing the concerns outlined above]{.underline}.\[31\] Also coming from
within Europe, [the European Council on Foreign Relations has published
objections to the idea]{.underline}.\[32\] In a broader sense, current
French president Emmanuel Macron has recently called for Europe to
achieve greater defense autonomy and rely less on the United States. In
his remarks, he suggested a move towards security cooperation with the
Russian Federation if the situation in Donbas deescalates.\[33\] [There
is no rational basis for providing Ukraine with]{.underline} Javelin
missile systems, or any other [lethal weaponry]{.underline}. [Such a
move has no positive effect for the Ukrainians on the
battlefield]{.underline}. [Instead, the United States is undertaking
several wholly preventable risks with the prospect of realizing zero
strategic ends. The Ukrainian armed forces are capable of sustaining
their mission domestically. Arming Ukraine is symbolically moral, but
chances an **increase in hostilities** that could **devolve into a
tit-for-tat proxy war**, or worse]{.underline}.

#### Putin will escalate with heightened aggression \-\-- goes nuclear

The last several days have seen the once dormant debate---whether or not
the U.S. should start supplying weapons to Ukraine---reignite. The
debate was revived by the release of a joint report by a group of
ex-U.S. officials affiliated with [three prominent American think
tanks]{.underline}, which [recommended that Washington urgently
supply]{.underline} anti-tank missiles, counter-battery radars, and
other [military hardware to the Ukrainian armed forces so that the
latter can deter Russia from escalating the conflict]{.underline} in
Donbass. I don't dispute that [the Ukrainian army would become stronger
if the U.S. delivers the recommended weapons. But]{.underline} the truth
is, [these weapons would not end the conflict]{.underline}. Moreover,
[these deliveries may actually prompt Russia to **increase** its
involvement in the conflict, dragging the U.S. into a **vicious cycle**
of escalating commitments]{.underline}. [Chances that the U.S. would
prevail in such an escalation are quite low.]{.underline} [Whatever U.S.
authorities would be realistically willing to do to help Ukraine
militarily can be]{.underline} matched, if not [exceeded]{.underline},
[by]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}, which is much more interested in
the outcome of the current stand-off and has resources on the ground. In
addition to escalating in Ukraine, [Russia could also respond to the
U.S. arming of Ukraine by adopting a more aggressive posture vis-à-vis
the U.S. in the realm of strategic nuclear deterrence]{.underline}, as
well as acting as a spoiler to undermine U.S. vital interests in such
spheres as countering proliferation of nuclear weapons and managing
China's rise. [Even some of Putin's critics in Western Europe admit that
the consequences of arming Ukraine]{.underline} will not be limited to
the conflict there. "It **[could lead to a nuclear war]{.underline}**,"
Polish statesman Lech Walesa said last year when asked whether the
Europeans should send weapons to Ukrainians. [The report]{.underline}
now [argues that a better-armed Ukrainian army would be able to inflict
greater casualties on Russian "volunteers"]{.underline} in Ukraine [and
that prospects of such casualties should help to deter Russia. Not
really]{.underline}. Yes, Vladimir Putin remains sensitive to casualties
among active-duty Russian personnel in the conflict, but only as long as
he maintains that Russia is not a party to the conflict. [The delivery
of U.S. arms could give Putin a pretext to either order a preemptive
strike to destroy]{.underline} the delivered [weapons, or even to send
troops to Ukraine openly]{.underline} in order to accomplish what the
Kremlin would describe as a just cause of protecting ethnic Russian
compatriots from the Ukrainian army that the Russian president has
already described as a "NATO legion." Once (and [if]{.underline}) [the
Russian army gets officially involved in the conflict, the Russian
population will become more tolerant toward casualties, and so will
Putin]{.underline}. The experience of the second Chechen war shows that
while the [Russian public's tolerance for casualties]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} not limitless, it can be [quite high]{.underline} as
long the Russians believe their army is fighting to defend the country's
interests and stands a fair chance of prevailing in the conflict. That
the Russian army will be able to win the military phase of the conflict
in Ukraine with relative ease is clear from Ukrainian commanders' own
confessions that they took a beating when Russian regular forces
allegedly moved in. [Ukraine will be destroyed militarily if the West
supplies weapons to Kiev]{.underline}, according to an article penned by
a member of Russia's Security Council Advisory Board for the next issue
of the Russia in Global Affairs journal. I should also note that the
U.S. government has already supplied counter-battery radars that the
report recommends sending to Ukrainian armed forces, but that those
supplies didn't lead to significant changes on the ground. It is also
unclear to me why a country which designs and manufactures an entire
line of armored vehicles, including APCs and MBTs, would need Humvees,
which do not really offer much protection from artillery or tank guns.
Among ex-Soviet republics, Ukraine's defense industry is second only to
Russia's, producing not only tanks, but also missiles and planes.
[Post-Soviet Ukraine]{.underline} also [has]{.underline} had such [a
surplus of arms]{.underline} that it has been selling them actively to
Georgia and other countries, netting more than \$1 billion a year from
exports of both used and new weaponry. [If the U.S. really wanted to
significantly alter the Russian-Ukrainian military balance, it would
have to supply game-changing systems. But we all know Washington is not
going to deliver the most advanced of its weaponry systems, and even if
it did, it would take a long time to train Ukrainians to operate those,
giving Russia time to carry out a preemptive strike]{.underline}. What
Ukraine needs more than any weapons is greater quantities of
professionally trained soldiers. Helping Ukraine to train and maintain a
larger professional army would accomplish much more in enhancing its
deterrence and combat capabilities than supplies of UAVs or Humvees ever
would. Only after such a professional army is formed can one think start
thinking about arming them with state-of-the-art weapons and systems,
the mastering of which would require a high level of basic knowledge
that conscripts lack. But again, Ukraine cannot afford such an army and
I have very strong doubts that the U.S. government will be willing to
spend the billions of dollars that would be needed to train, arm, and
maintain a force that would be armed and numerous enough to fight
Russian armed forces to a standstill. Such core members of NATO as
Germany and France have already stated they have no plans to participate
in arming Ukraine. When weighing whether to accept the report's
recommendations, [U.S. policymakers should not lose sight of the bigger
picture]{.underline}. And the bigger picture is that integration of
Ukraine, which is located thousands of miles away from the U.S. and
which 84% Americans cannot locate on the map, into the Western economic
and military architecture doesn't represent a U.S. vital interest.
[America has somehow survived without a Western-integrated Ukraine, and
it can easily continue to prosper without becoming a de-facto
military-technical ally of Ukraine]{.underline}, which is what the U.S.
would become if the report's recommendations are fulfilled. In
comparison, even if we were to acknowledge that Ukraine occupies a
special place in Russian history, it is in contemporary Russia's vital
interest to ensure that that its Slav neighbor is at least neutral, if
not friendly, to Russia. [Yes, the conflict in Ukraine has done serious
damage]{.underline} to the non-proliferation regime, given that Russia
has violated its Budapest Memorandum obligation. [But that damage has
already been done and should be treated as what economists describe as
"sunken costs."]{.underline} [It is]{.underline} also [extremely
important for the U.S. to ensure the alliance's ability to defend
itself. But deterring Russia from challenging NATO's Article V
obligation]{.underline}, covertly or overtly, [requires **strengthening
the alliance itself rather than arming a neighbor that is bound to
lose**]{.underline}, no matter how many arms it gets, [if Russia decides
to stage an open military intervention]{.underline}.

#### Arms sales cause Russian revisionists to win the [internal Kremlin debate]{.underline}\-\--nuclear war

not arm Ukraine," *Women in International Security*,

[Hawks in Washington are arguing that the West should deliver lethal
defensive weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces]{.underline}. At a
moment of political uncertainty in Moscow, [their view is that the NATO
alliance should show the Kremlin it is not feckless when faced with
Vladimir Putin's aggression]{.underline}. [Such a policy would certainly
make the congressional Rambos feel good]{.underline}. [But flooding
Ukraine with advanced weapons which its troops have not been trained to
use would be dangerous and almost certainly lead to an escalation that
would play to Russia's]{.underline} local military [superiority while
failing to bolster Ukraine's capabilities]{.underline}. [There are three
reasons]{.underline} for this. [First]{.underline}, [sending lethal
weapons to Ukraine could **sleepwalk the world into its first nuclear
war**, at a time when the rules of restraint worked out by the
superpowers in the original Cold War have expired]{.underline}. [Second,
it ignores the fact that Ukraine]{.underline}, once the war smithy of
the Soviet Union, [is the world's tenth largest arms
exporter]{.underline}. It would be far cheaper to send ten executives on
sabbatical from Boeing to Kyiv to advise Ukraine on modernizing its own
heavy weapons production. [Third, given Ukraine's history of corruption,
deliveries of billions of dollars of weaponry could tempt Ukrainian
oligarchs to revert to business as usual]{.underline} as the shock of
Russia's year-old attack wears off. [Western arms injections could
hardly save Ukraine from further dismemberment]{.underline}, given the
ratio of Ukraine's 121,000 active servicemen to Russia's 771,000 and
just over 2,000 Ukrainian tanks to Russia's 20,000. Indeed, [a
demonstrative influx of western arms into Ukraine would simply force
**any risk-averse demurrers** in the Kremlin to **join in common
defiance** of the American bogey\[person\]]{.underline}man [with the
ultranationalists whom Putin has empowered]{.underline}. [Hawks in the
West tacitly admit that Moscow holds 'escalation dominance' in its own
backyard by barring any western boots on the ground]{.underline}. As
Antony Blinken, the US deputy secretary of state, explained in defending
Barack Obama's scepticism about funnelling weapons to Kyiv: '[Anything
we did as countries in terms of military support for Ukraine is likely
to be matched and then]{.underline} doubled, tripled and
**[quadrupled]{.underline}** [by Russia]{.underline}.' [Russia, the
regional military giant, can instantly trump each western military
initiative in any upward spiral]{.underline}. [Its claim to an
existential geopolitical interest in neighbouring Ukraine also trumps
the distant West's half-hearted, peripheral interest]{.underline}.
[Where western hawks fail the sobriety test is in their refusal to
specify how they would respond]{.underline} in the next weeks [if a game
of chicken proceeds on Russian rules and Moscow keeps raising the stakes
all the way up to the **nuclear level**]{.underline}. **[This is not
idle speculation]{.underline}**. [Putin has said that he was **ready to
put nuclear forces on alert** to defend his original takeover of
Crimea]{.underline} a year ago.

#### This conflict goes nuclear, even if neither side initially intends to

**Mearhseimer 15** - professor of political science at the University of
Chicago (John, "Don\'t Arm Ukraine," *New York Times*,

The Ukraine crisis is almost a year old and Russia is winning. The
separatists in eastern Ukraine are gaining ground and Russia's
president, Vladimir V. Putin, shows no signs of backing down in the face
of Western economic sanctions. Unsurprisingly, [a growing chorus of
voices in the United States is calling for arming Ukraine]{.underline}.
A recent report from three leading American think tanks endorses sending
Kiev advanced weaponry, and the White House's nominee for secretary of
defense, Ashton B. Carter, said last week to the Senate armed services
committee, "I very much incline in that direction." [They are wrong.
Going down that road would be a huge mistake for the United States, NATO
and Ukraine itself]{.underline}. [Sending weapons to Ukraine will not
rescue its army and will instead lead to an escalation in the fighting.
Such a step is especially dangerous because Russia has thousands of
nuclear weapons and is seeking to defend a vital strategic
interest]{.underline}. There is no question that Ukraine's military is
badly outgunned by the separatists, who have Russian troops and weapons
on their side. [Because the balance of power decisively favors Moscow,
Washington would have to send large amounts of equipment for Ukraine's
army to have a fighting chance]{.underline}. [But the conflict will not
end there. Russia would counter-escalate]{.underline}, [taking away any
temporary benefit Kiev might get from American arms]{.underline}. The
authors of the think tank study concede this, noting that "even with
enormous support from the West, the Ukrainian Army will not be able to
defeat a determined attack by the Russian military." In short, [the
United States cannot win an arms race with Russia over Ukraine and
thereby ensure Russia's defeat on the battlefield]{.underline}.
[Proponents of arming Ukraine]{.underline} have a second line of
argument. The key to success, they [maintain, is not to defeat Russia
militarily, but to raise the costs of fighting to the point where Mr.
Putin will cave]{.underline}. The pain will supposedly compel Moscow to
withdraw its troops from Ukraine and allow it to join the European Union
and NATO and become an ally of the West. [This coercive strategy is also
unlikely to work, no matter how much punishment the West inflicts. What
advocates of arming Ukraine fail to understand is that Russian leaders
believe their country's core strategic interests are at stake in
Ukraine]{.underline}; they are unlikely to give ground, even if it means
absorbing huge costs. [Great powers react harshly when distant rivals
project military power into their neighborhood]{.underline}, much less
attempt to make a country on their border an ally. [This is why the
United States has the Monroe Doctrine, and today no American leader
would ever tolerate Canada or Mexico joining a military alliance headed
by another great power]{.underline}. [Russia is no exception in this
regard]{.underline}. Thus Mr. [Putin]{.underline} has not budged in the
face of sanctions and [is unlikely to make meaningful concessions if the
costs of the fighting in Ukraine increase]{.underline}. [Upping the ante
in Ukraine]{.underline} also [risks **unwanted escalation**. Not only
would the fighting in eastern Ukraine be sure to intensify, but it could
also spread to other areas]{.underline}. [The consequences for
Ukraine]{.underline}, which already faces profound economic and social
problems, [would be disastrous]{.underline}. The possibility that Mr.
Putin might end up making nuclear threats may seem remote, but [if the
goal of arming Ukraine is to drive up the costs of Russian interference
and eventually put Moscow in an acute situation]{.underline}, it cannot
be ruled out. If Western pressure succeeded and Mr. [Putin]{.underline}
felt desperate, he [would have a **powerful incentive to try to rescue
the situation by rattling the nuclear saber**.]{.underline} Our
understanding of the mechanisms of escalation in crises and war is
limited at best, although we know the risks are considerable. [Pushing a
nuclear-armed Russia into a corner would be **playing with
fire**]{.underline}. Advocates of arming Ukraine recognize the
escalation problem, which is why they stress giving Kiev "defensive,"
not "offensive," weapons. Unfortunately, there is no useful distinction
between these categories: All weapons can be used for attacking and
defending. The West can be sure, though, that Moscow will not see those
American weapons as "defensive," given that Washington is determined to
reverse the status quo in eastern Ukraine. [The only way to solve the
Ukraine crisis is diplomatically, not militarily]{.underline}. Germany's
chancellor, Angela Merkel, seems to recognize that fact, as she has said
Germany will not ship arms to Kiev. Her problem, however, is that she
does not know how to bring the crisis to an end.

#### Deterrence fails\-\--Russia is motivated by fear [not]{.underline} ambition

**Walt 15** -- PhD, Professor of International Affairs @ Harvard
(Stephen, "Why Arming Kiev Is a Really, Really Bad Idea: Washington
pundits are jumping on a proposal to send weapons to Ukraine. Here\'s
why they all need to take a deep breath.," *Foreign Policy*,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/09/how-not-to-save-ukraine-arming-kiev-is-a-bad-idea/)//BB>

[Should the United States start arming Ukraine]{.underline}, so it can
better resist and maybe even defeat the Russian-backed rebels in its
eastern provinces? A lot of seasoned American diplomats and foreign
policy experts seem to think so; a task force assembled by the Brookings
Institution, the Atlantic Council, and the Chicago Council on Global
Affairs wants the United States to send Ukraine \$1 billion in military
assistance as soon as possible, with more to come. The Obama
administration is rethinking its earlier reluctance, and secretary of
defense nominee Ash Carter told a Senate hearing he was "very much
inclined" to favor this course as well. Unless cooler heads prevail,
therefore, [the United States seems to be moving toward raising the
stakes in Ukraine]{.underline}. This decision is somewhat surprising,
however, because [few experts think this bankrupt and divided country is
a vital strategic interest and no one is talking about sending U.S.
troops to fight]{.underline} on Kiev's behalf. So the question is: [does
sending Ukraine a bunch of advanced weaponry make sense?]{.underline}
The answer is **[no]{.underline}**. [One reason to be skeptical of the
report from the three think tanks is the track record of its like-minded
members]{.underline}. [The task force wasn't made up of a diverse set of
experts seeking to explore a wide range of options and find some
creative common ground]{.underline}. On the contrary, [its members were
all people who have long backed NATO expansion and have an obvious
desire to defend that policy, which has played a central role in
creating the present crisis]{.underline}. After all, [these are the same
people who have been telling us since the late 1990s that expanding NATO
eastwards posed no threat to Russia and would instead create a vast and
enduring zone of peace in Europe]{.underline}. **[That prediction is now
in tatters]{.underline}**, [alas]{.underline}, [but these experts are
now doubling down to defend a policy that was questionable from the
beginning and clearly **taken much too far**]{.underline}. As the
critics warned it would, [open-ended NATO expansion has done more to
poison relations with Russia than any other single Western
policy]{.underline}. [Those who favor arming Ukraine are]{.underline}
also [applying "deterrence model" remedies to what is almost certainly a
"spiral model" situation]{.underline}. In his classic book Perception
and Misperception in International Politics, political scientist Robert
Jervis pointed out that states may undertake what appear to be
threatening actions for two very different reasons. [Sometimes states
act aggressively because their leaders are]{.underline} greedy, seeking
some sort of personal glory, or [ideologically driven to
expand]{.underline}, and are not reacting to perceived threats from
others. The classic example, of course, is Adolf Hitler and Nazi
Germany, and in such cases accommodation won't work. [Here the
"deterrence model" applies: the only thing to do is issue warnings and
credible threats]{.underline} so that the potential aggressor is
deterred from pursuing its irrevocably revisionist aims. [By contrast,
the "spiral model" applies when a state's seemingly aggressive policy is
motivated primarily by fear or insecurity]{.underline}. [Making threats
and trying to deter or coerce them will only reinforce their fears and
make them even more aggressive, in effect triggering an action-reaction
spiral of growing hostility]{.underline}. [When insecurity is the
taproot of a state's revisionist actions, making threats just makes the
situation worse]{.underline}. [When the "spiral model" applies, the
proper response is a diplomatic process of accommodation and
appeasement]{.underline} (yes, appeasement) [to allay the insecure
state's concerns]{.underline}. [Such efforts]{.underline} do not require
giving an opponent everything it might want or removing every one of its
worries, but it does [require a serious effort to address]{.underline}
the [insecurities]{.underline} that are motivating the other side's
objectionable behavior. The problem, of course, is that [responses that
work well in one situation tend to fail badly in the other]{.underline}.
Applying the deterrence model to an insecure adversary will heighten its
paranoia and fuel its defensive reactions, while appeasing an
incorrigible aggressor is likely to whet its appetite and make it harder
to deter it in the future. [Those who now favor arming Ukraine clearly
believe the "deterrence model" is the right way to think about this
problem]{.underline}. In this view, Vladimir Putin is a relentless
aggressor who is trying to recreate something akin to the old Soviet
empire, and thus not confronting him over Ukraine will lead him to take
aggressive actions elsewhere. The only thing to do, therefore, is
increase the costs until Russia backs down and leaves Ukraine free to
pursue its own foreign policy. This is precisely the course of action
the report from the three think tanks recommends: in addition to
"bolstering deterrence," its authors believe arming Ukraine will help
"produce conditions in which Moscow decides to negotiate a genuine
settlement that allows Ukraine to reestablish full sovereignty." In
addition to bolstering deterrence, in short, giving arms to Kiev is
intended to coerce Moscow into doing what we want. [Yet the evidence in
this case suggests the spiral model is far more applicable. Russia is
not an ambitious rising power like Nazi Germany or contemporary China;
it is an aging, depopulating, and declining great power trying to cling
to whatever international influence it still possesses and preserve a
modest sphere]{.underline} of influence near its borders, so that
stronger states --- and especially the United States --- cannot take
advantage of its growing vulnerabilities. [Putin & Co. are also
genuinely worried about America's efforts to promote "regime change"
around the world]{.underline} --- including Ukraine --- a policy that
could eventually threaten their own positions. [It is lingering
**fear**, **rather than relentless ambition**, that underpins Russia's
response in Ukraine]{.underline}. Moreover, the Ukraine crisis did not
begin with a bold Russian move or even a series of illegitimate Russian
demands; it began when the United States and European Union tried to
move Ukraine out of Russia's orbit and into the West's sphere of
influence. That objective may be desirable in the abstract, but Moscow
made it abundantly clear it would fight this process tooth and nail.
U.S. leaders blithely ignored these warnings --- which clearly stemmed
from Russian insecurity rather than territorial greed --- and not
surprisingly they have been blindsided by Moscow's reaction. The failure
of U.S. diplomats to anticipate Putin's heavy-handed response was an act
of remarkable diplomatic incompetence, and one can only wonder why the
individuals who helped produce this train wreck still have their jobs.
If we are in a "spiral model" situation, [arming Ukraine will only make
things worse]{.underline}. [It certainly will not enable Ukraine to
defeat the far stronger Russian army; it will simply intensify the
conflict and add to the suffering of the Ukrainian people]{.underline}.
[Nor is arming Ukraine likely to convince Putin to cave in and give
Washington what it wants]{.underline}. Ukraine is historically linked to
Russia, they are right next door to each other, Russian intelligence has
long-standing links inside Ukraine's own security institutions, and
Russia is far stronger militarily. [Even massive arms shipments from the
United States won't tip the balance]{.underline} in Kiev's favor, and
[Moscow can always escalate if the fighting turns against the
rebels]{.underline}, as it did last summer. [Most importantly, Ukraine's
fate is much more important to Moscow than it is to us]{.underline},
which means that Putin and Russia will be willing to pay a bigger price
to achieve their aims than we will. [The balance of resolve as well as
the local balance of power strongly favors Moscow in this conflict.
Before starting down an escalatory path, therefore, Americans should ask
themselves just how far they are willing to go. If Moscow has more
options, is willing to endure more pain, and run more risks than we are,
then it makes no sense to begin a competition in resolve we are unlikely
to win]{.underline}. And [no, that doesn't show the West is irresolute,
craven, or spineless; it simply means Ukraine is a vital strategic
interest for Russia but not for]{.underline} us. Efforts to resolve this
crisis are also handicapped by the U.S. tendency to indulge in
"take-it-or-leave it" diplomacy. Efforts to resolve this crisis are also
handicapped by the U.S. tendency to indulge in "take-it-or-leave it"
diplomacy. Instead of engaging in genuine bargaining, American officials
tend to tell others what to do and then ramp up the pressure if they do
not comply. [Today, those who want to arm Ukraine are demanding that
Russia]{.underline} cease all of its activities in Ukraine, withdraw
from Crimea, and let Ukraine join the EU and/or NATO if it wants and if
it meets the membership requirements. In other words, they expect Moscow
to [abandon its own interests in Ukraine, full stop]{.underline}. It
would be wonderful if Western diplomacy could pull off this miracle, but
how likely is it? [Given Russia's history]{.underline}, its proximity to
Ukraine, and its long-term security concerns, [it is hard to imagine
Putin capitulating to our demands without a long and costly struggle
that will do enormous additional damage to Ukraine]{.underline}. And
[let's not forget the broader costs of this feckless policy. We are
pushing Russia closer to China]{.underline}, which is not in the
long-term U.S. interest. We have brought cooperation on nuclear security
with Russia to an end, even though there are still large quantities of
inadequately secured nuclear material on Russian soil. And we are surely
prolonging the suffering of the Ukrainian people. The solution to this
crisis is for the United States and its allies to abandon the dangerous
and unnecessary goal of endless NATO expansion and do whatever it takes
to convince Russia that we want Ukraine to be a neutral buffer state in
perpetuity. We should then work with Russia, the EU, and the IMF to
develop an economic program that puts that unfortunate country back on
its feet. [Arming Ukraine]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is a
**recipe for a longer and more destructive conflict**. It's easy to
prescribe such actions when you're **safely located in a Washington
think tank**, but destroying Ukraine in order to save it is hardly smart
or morally correct diplomacy]{.underline}.

#### Independent of Russian escalation, the US will face [credibility concerns]{.underline} that cause the US to overreact

**Menon 15** -- professor of political science at City College of New
York and a senior research fellow at Columbia\'s Saltzman Institute of
War and Peace Studies (Rajan, "Want to arm Kiev? Better have a Plan B,"
*LA Times*,
<https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-menon-arming-ukraine-20150205-story.html)//BB>

To say that the truce in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed breakaway
\"republics\" are battling the pro-Western Kiev government, isn\'t
holding is like saying the Titanic sprung a leak. The cease-fire signed
in September is a dead letter. There\'s a full-blown war afoot. And
whatever Moscow may claim, Russia is deeply involved, and not just as a
source of \"volunteers.\" So [should the West arm the embattled
Ukrainians? Yes, according to a new report released by the Atlantic
Council]{.underline}, the Brookings Institution and the Chicago Council
on Global Affairs. Washington notables involved in the report include
Michele Flournoy, until recently a senior official in the Defense
Department; Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of State in the Clinton
administration; and two former U.S. ambassadors to Ukraine. Their
proposal to funnel defensive weapons (the offensive-defensive
distinction is in fact hardly clear-cut) to Ukraine must be taken
seriously. It calls for \$1 billion in arms to Ukraine for 2015, and the
same in 2016 and 2017. [The thoughts of these Beltway power brokers
could shape U.S. policy]{.underline}. Moreover, their prescriptions have
made a splash at a delicate moment. The Obama administration appears to
be under pressure from hard-liners inside Congress and from various
policy wonks to do, at minimum, what this group recommends. [That a
cluster of people with clout has offered one answer doesn\'t mean it\'s
the right one]{.underline}. [In fact, it\'s not; the report is flawed,
even **dangerous**]{.underline}. [The group assumes that sending Ukraine
arms will send Russian President Vladimir Putin a clear
message]{.underline}. Just so. [But what message exactly? They assume
that Putin will recalculate and wind down the war once he sees that the
United States is serious about backing Ukraine]{.underline} and that
victory will be costlier, bloodier and more uncertain than he\'d
anticipated. Well, that\'s one possibility. But it\'s not the only one.
[Putin\'s main defense for his war has been that the West is actively
undermining Russia\'s security by drawing into its orbit what from the
Russian standpoint is a critical country. Arming Ukraine]{.underline},
therefore, probably [would prompt Putin to **scale up** the war. He
would send the secessionists more troops, advisors and
arms]{.underline}. [The Russian people would approve.]{.underline}
Whatever we may think of Putin\'s war, it has deep support in Russian
society, and so does he. And, no, it\'s not just because of government
propaganda. [The arrival of American arms and advisors in Ukraine won\'t
weaken Putin politically. It would]{.underline}, despite the economic
crisis, **[bolster him]{.underline}**. There\'s a bigger problem.
[Western sanctions have created colossal problems for Russia\'s
economy]{.underline}. But the 50% collapse in the price of oil is a body
blow. [Yet there\'s **not a shred** of evidence that Putin has changed
course in Ukraine]{.underline}. [To the contrary]{.underline}.
[Moscow\'s backing for the separatists has increased]{.underline},
enabling them to regain some of the land lost to Ukraine\'s
counteroffensive. [The presumption that Putin will back off once Kiev
gets U.S. weaponry is **not based on evidence but hope**. And hope is
not a strategy]{.underline}. [Then there\'s the Plan B problem. There\'s
a basic axiom in war: Don\'t take a big step]{.underline} (or even a
small one) [without having thought hard, and planned for, what you will
do if it doesn\'t have the intended effect]{.underline}. **[There is no
Plan B]{.underline}** in the report. [We\'re simply to assume that
Putin\'s response will be the one the experts anticipate]{.underline}.
Given what\'s at stake, what amounts to a \"trust us\" approach won\'t
do. But [here\'s the plan\'s biggest flaw. Imagine that a Ukrainian army
beefed up with American weaponry suffers serial defeats]{.underline}.
This is not a fanciful scenario. Russia has a lot more at stake than the
U.S. does and will fight hard. Moreover, it knows the terrain and
players in eastern Ukraine a lot better, and it\'s a lot closer. What
then? You won\'t find an answer in the notables\' report. Following the
counsel of this all-star conclave would put the United States in a
position that even those with a rudimentary grasp of strategy know to
avoid. [We would have to retreat or wade in deepe]{.underline}r. [If
things don\'t go according to plan]{.underline}, [solemn warnings from
hawks about the loss of American credibility would **inevitably
follow**]{.underline}. [There would be calls to up the ante. Heeding
that counsel could put us at **war with Russia --- on its
doorstep**]{.underline}.

#### That's particularly true in a Black Hawk Down scenario

**Rumer** and Graham **15** -- \*former national intelligence officer
for Russia and Eurasia at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, is a
senior fellow and the director of Carnegie's Russia and Eurasia Program.
\*\*PhD in Politics @ Harvard, Senior Fellow, Yale Jackson Institute for
Global Affairs (Eugene and Thomas, "Arm Ukraine and You Risk Another
Black Hawk Down," *Carnegie Endowment*,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2015/02/03/arm-ukraine-and-you-risk-another-black-hawk-down-pub-58946)//BB>

[The logic is misguided, but it is easy enough to grasp]{.underline}.
Ukraine's poorly equipped army cannot on its own inflict enough pain on
the Russian-backed separatist insurgency to force an effective ceasefire
that might lead to a negotiated truce. So [America should help by
sending defensive weapons, and some lethal ones too. Once body bags
start arriving in Russian towns]{.underline} ([the theory
goes)]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin will relent]{.underline},
fearing a backlash from a public already unnerved by soaring inflation.
This is the case made by a group of former senior US officials, and it
is reportedly being discussed within the Obama administration. [It
is,]{.underline} however, [deeply mistaken. Intended to help a stricken
country, it could instead prolong Ukraine's agony and distract it from
the vital task of reconstruction]{.underline}. [It is highly unlikely to
knock]{.underline} Mr [Putin off his destructive course]{.underline}.
And [it would bring the US a step closer to direct military
confrontation with Russia]{.underline}. [Russians support]{.underline}
Mr [Putin]{.underline}. The Kremlin has blamed the economic crisis on
western sanctions, and it will blame military casualties on the west,
too. There is nothing to suggest that Russians do not believe the
Kremlin narrative. [They are unlikely to abandon]{.underline} Mr [Putin
in his struggle against the west]{.underline}. There are practical
questions, too. [It is pointless to send weapons to troops not trained
in their use]{.underline}. Will the [US]{.underline} and its allies send
[trainers]{.underline} to eastern Ukraine? If they do, they [will
be]{.underline} sending Americans [in]{.underline}to [a war zone with
Russia as the enemy]{.underline}. [It will be hard to pretend then that
the US is not a party to the conflict]{.underline}. What, realistically,
are the chances of making sure that only regular Ukrainian troops, and
not private militias, have access to western-supplied weapons? If a
western non-combatant in uniform is captured by the separatists, does
the US try to rescue them? Mark Bowden's **[Black Hawk
Down]{.underline}** chronicled the perils of such an operation in
downtown Mogadishu. Imagine what [could happen **10 miles from the
Russian border**, in an area **controlled by Russian
personnel**]{.underline}. Finally, imagine the response. What do we do
if Russia continues to escalate the conflict? Or if the Kremlin launches
a cyber attack against an American financial institution, destroying
data about asset ownership? Does America then inch closer towards war?
It is not a kindness to kindle unrealistic hopes. [Of course Ukraine is
a victim of aggression]{.underline}. But, short of a campaign like that
fought by the US and its allies in the Balkans in the 1990s --- which no
one now advocates --- [no amount of US]{.underline} or Nato [assistance
can alter the fact that Russia has the upper hand]{.underline}. In
August, and again in January, Mr Putin chose to escalate rather than
allow the separatists to be defeated. Ukraine will need help rebuilding
its army, and the US should provide it. But it will take years, and
cannot be done in the middle of a war with a more powerful neighbour. In
contrast to this bold proposal to send arms to Ukraine, western economic
assistance for the country has so far been timid. The US has promised
\$3bn in loan guarantees, a fraction of the tens of billions the country
needs. In part, that is because Washington still suspects rampant
corruption in Kiev. Will the military function better than the
government it serves? [Ukraine cannot win this conflict now. It must be
frozen]{.underline}. Ukraine's leaders should be told as much. [It will
deepen the tragedy if soldiers are sent to fight a hopeless battle. A
free and independent Ukraine]{.underline}, a solid defence of the
European order and a firm rebuff of Russian aggression [are worthy
goals. But they do not absolve us of our responsibility to consider the
consequences of our actions. The current proposal to arm Ukraine does
not meet that standard]{.underline}.

#### Once a [minor conflict]{.underline} starts, it escalates \-\-- neither side has de-escalation measures in place, and both leaders are conflict-prone

**Wood 17** - senior military correspondent for The Huffington Post. His
second book, What Have We Done: the Moral Injury of Our Longest Wars,
based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on veterans of Iraq and
Afghanistan, was published by Little, Brown in November 2016. (David,
"THIS IS HOW THE NEXT WORLD WAR STARTS,"
<https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/trump-russia-putin-military-crisis/)//BB>

[Putin's favored tactic]{.underline}, intelligence officials say,
[is]{.underline} known as "[escalation dominance]{.underline}." [The
idea is to]{.underline} push the other side until you win, a senior
officer based in Europe explained---to "[escalate to the point where the
adversary stops]{.underline}, won't go farther. [It's a very
destabilizing strategy]{.underline}." Stavridis cast it in the terms of
an old Russian proverb: "Probe with a bayonet; when you hit steel
withdraw, when you hit mush, proceed." Right now, he added, "the
Russians keep pushing out and hitting mush." This mindset is basically
the opposite of how both American and Soviet leaders approached each
other during the Cold War, even during periods of exceptional stress
such as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Having endured the devastation of
World War II, they understood the horror that lurked on the far side of
a crisis. "When things started to get too close, they would back off,"
said Miller, the retired Pentagon official. The term of art for this
constant recalibration of risk is "crisis management"---the "most
demanding form of diplomacy," writes Sir Lawrence Freedman, an emeritus
professor of war studies at King's College London. Leaders had to make
delicate judgments about when to push their opponent and when to create
face-saving off-ramps. Perhaps most critically, they had to possess the
confidence to de-escalate when necessary. Skilled crisis management,
Freedman writes, requires "an ability to match deeds with words, to
convey threats without appearing reckless, and to offer concessions
without appearing soft, often while under intense media scrutiny and
facing severe time pressures." A recent textbook example came in January
2016, when Iran seized those 10 U.S. Navy sailors, claiming that they
had been spying in Iranian waters in the eastern Persian Gulf. President
Barack Obama's secretary of state, John Kerry, immediately opened
communications with his counterpart in Tehran, using channels
established for negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran. By the next
morning, the sailors had been released. The U.S. acknowledged the
sailors had strayed into Iranian waters but did not apologize, asserting
that the transgression had been an innocent error. Iran, meanwhile,
acknowledged that the sailors had not been spying. (The peaceful
resolution was not applauded by Breitbart News, headed at the time by
Stephen Bannon, who is now Trump's chief White House strategist. Obama,
a Breitbart writer sneered, has been "castrated on the world stage by
Iran.") [Neither Putin nor Trump, it's safe to say, are crisis managers
by nature. Both are notoriously thin-skinned, operate on instinct, and
have a tendency to shun expert advice]{.underline}. (These days, [Putin
is said to surround himself not with seasoned diplomats but cronies from
his old spy days]{.underline}.) [Both are unafraid of brazenly lying,
fueling an atmosphere of extreme distrust on both sides]{.underline}.
[Stavridis, who has studied both Putin and Trump]{.underline} and who
met with Trump in December, [concluded that the two leaders "are not
risk-averse. They are risk-affectionate]{.underline}." Aron, the Russia
expert, said, "I think [there is a]{.underline} much more [cavalier
attitude by Putin toward war in general and the threat of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. He continued, "He is not a madman, but [he is much
more inclined to use the threat of nuclear weapons in]{.underline}
conventional \[[military]{.underline}\] [and political confrontation
with the West]{.underline}." Perhaps the most significant difference
between the two is that Putin is far more calculating than Trump. In
direct negotiations, he is said to rely on videotaped analysis of the
facial expressions of foreign leaders that signal when the person is
bluffing, confused or lying. [At times, Trump has been surprisingly
quick to lash out at a perceived slight from Putin]{.underline},
although these moments have been overshadowed by his effusive praise for
the Russian leader. On December 22, Putin promised to strengthen
Russia's strategic nuclear forces in his traditional year-end speech to
his officer corps. Hours later, Trump vowed, via Twitter, to "greatly
strengthen and expand" the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal. On Morning Joe
the following day, host Mika Brzezinski said that Trump had told her on
a phone call, "Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every
pass and outlast them all." And in late March, the Wall Street Journal
reported that Trump was becoming increasingly frustrated with Russia,
throwing up his hands in exasperation when informed that Russia may have
violated an arms treaty. [Some]{.underline} in national security circles
see Trump's impulsiveness as a cause for concern but not for panic. "He
can always overreact," [said]{.underline} Anthony Cordesman, senior
strategic analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
and a veteran of many national security posts throughout the U.S.
government. "\[But\] [there are a lot of people \[around the president\]
to prevent an overreaction]{.underline} with serious consequences."
Let's say that Trump acted upon his impulse to tell a fighter pilot to
shoot a jet that barrel-rolled an American plane. Such a response would
still have to be carried out by the Pentagon, Cordesman said---a process
with lots of room for senior officers to say, "Look, boss, this is a
great idea but can we talk about the repercussions?" And **[yet that
process is no longer as robust as it once was]{.underline}**. [Many
senior policymaking positions at the Pentagon and State Department
remain unfilled]{.underline}. A small cabal in the White House,
including Bannon, Jared Kushner and a few others, has asserted a role in
foreign policy decisions outside the normal NSC process. It's not yet
clear how much influence is wielded by Trump's widely respected national
security adviser, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. [When lines of
authority and influence are so murky, it increases the risk that a minor
incident could boil up into an unintended clash]{.underline}, said
retired Marine Corps General John Allen, who has served in senior
military and diplomatic posts. [To complicate matters further, the
relentless pace of information in the social media age has destroyed the
one precious factor that helped former leaders safely navigate perilous
situations: time]{.underline}. It's hard to believe now, but during the
1962 Cuban missile crisis, for instance, President Kennedy and his
advisers deliberated for a full 10 weeks before announcing a naval
quarantine of the island. In 1969, a U.S. spy plane was shot down by
North Korean jets over the Sea of Japan, killing all 31 Americans on
board. It took 26 hours for the Pentagon and State Department to
recommend courses of action to President Richard Nixon, according to a
declassified secret assessment. (Nixon eventually decided not to
respond.) Today, thanks to real-time video and data streaming, the men
in the Kremlin and White House can know---or think they know---as much
as the guy in the cockpit of a plane or on the bridge of a warship. The
president no longer needs to rely on reports from military leaders that
have been filtered through their expertise and deeper knowledge of the
situation on the ground. Instead, he can watch a crisis unfold on a
screen and react in real time. [Once news of an incident hits the
internet, the pressure to respond becomes even harder to
withstand]{.underline}. "[The ability to recover from early missteps is
greatly reduced,]{.underline}" Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has written. "[The speed of war
has changed, and the nature of these changes makes the global security
environment even more unpredictable, dangerous, and
unforgiving]{.underline}." And so in the end, [no matter how cool and
unflappable the instincts of military men and women]{.underline} like
Kevin Webster, [what will smother the inevitable spark is steady,
thoughtful leadership from within the White House and the
Kremlin]{.underline}. [A recognition that first reports may be wrong; a
willingness to absorb new and perhaps unwelcome information; a thick
skin to ward off insults and accusations]{.underline}; an acknowledgment
of the limited value of threats and bluffs; and [a willingness to
recognize the core interests of the other side]{.underline} and a
willingness to accept a face-saving solution. **[These qualities are not
notably on display in either capital]{.underline}**.

#### [Only]{.underline} U.S.-Russian war causes extinction

Lecturer in Mathematics at Oxford, Research Associate at the Future of
Humanity Institute; "Existential Risk: Diplomacy and Governance,"

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
nuclear war between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Russia]{.underline}, despite horrific casualties, [neither country's
population is likely to be completely destroyed **by the direct effects
of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The aftermath could
be **much worse**]{.underline}: the [burning]{.underline} of [flammable
materials could send massive amounts of smoke into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and cause sustained
global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption -- **[a
nuclear winter]{.underline}**. According to one model 9 , [an all-out
exchange of 4,000 weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop in global
temperatures of around 8°C, making it **impossible to grow food
for**]{.underline} 4 to [**5 years**. This could leave some
survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, [but they
would be in a very precarious situation and the **threat of extinction
from other sources would be great**. An exchange on this scale is **only
possible between the US and Russia** who have more than 90% of the
world's nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500
warheads each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some
models suggest that even [a small regional nuclear war involving 100
nuclear weapons would]{.underline} produce a nuclear winter serious
enough to [put two billion]{.underline} people [at risk]{.underline} of
starvation,12 [though this]{.underline} estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale are **unlikely to lead
to**]{.underline} outright **[human extinction]{.underline}**, but this
does suggest that conflicts which are around an order of magnitude
larger may be likely to threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised
that there is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large
nuclear war on global climate. This remains an area where increased
academic research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a
better understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt,
would have high returns. [It is]{.underline} very [difficult to
precisely estimate the probability of **existential risk from nuclear
war**]{.underline} over the next century, and existing attempts leave
very large confidence intervals. According to many experts, [the most
likely nuclear war]{.underline} at present [is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given the relatively modest size of
their arsenals, the risk of human extinction is **plausibly greater**
from a conflict between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and Russia]{.underline}. Tensions between these countries have
increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

#### Ending arms sales [caps the conflict]{.underline} \-\-- they should not be used for negotiation or pressure

**Semchuk** 3-27-20**19** -- MPhil in Comparative Government @ Oxford,
PhD Candidate in Politics, University of Oxford (Liana, "Ukraine: US
arms sales making big business money while ordinary people pay the
price," *The Conversation*,
<https://theconversation.com/ukraine-us-arms-sales-making-big-business-money-while-ordinary-people-pay-the-price-114238)//BB>

[Selling lethal weapons to Ukraine is the equivalent of pouring
**kerosene onto a flame**]{.underline}. But ongoing
[hostilities]{.underline} between Ukraine and Russia -- including the
Kerch strait crisis, which began late last year when Russia intercepted
three Ukrainian vessels and took 24 crew members captive --
[are]{.underline} also [a]{.underline} [major business opportunity
for]{.underline} the world's largest [defence contractors]{.underline}.
[Despite the risk of serious escalation, these companies continue to
provide Ukraine with lethal aid]{.underline} so it can defend itself
against Russia -- for a price, of course. The US special representative
for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt [Volker, stated recently]{.underline}
that Washington remains committed to providing support to Ukraine and
its military, including anti-tank systems. He even hinted that [the US
is considering expanding the types of lethal aid that it could begin
selling to Ukraine, saying: "We also need to be looking at things like
air defence and coastal defence]{.underline}." [This is a troubling
prospect]{.underline}. In March, US army general Curtis Scaparrotti said
that the US could also bolster the Ukrainian military's sniper
capabilities. Speaking to the Senate Armed Services Committee, he said:
There are other systems, sniper systems, ammunition and, perhaps looking
at the Kerch Strait, perhaps consideration for naval systems, as well,
here in the future as we move forward. [This]{.underline} comment has
been widely underreported and [has not received nearly as much attention
as it deserves considering the potential consequences]{.underline}. At
worst, [more lethal aid could **escalate** the conflict
further]{.underline}. At best, it will continue to keep alive a conflict
that has already claimed more than 10,000 lives. Finding a
straightforward policy alternative is difficult, but [sending more
lethal aid to achieve the unattainable goal of Ukraine defeating Russia
is **certainly no solution**]{.underline}. Impact Despite attempts by
Volker and Scaparrotti to market the proposition as a way to help
Ukraine defend itself against Russia, the immediate benefits seem
clearer to America's weapons manufacturing sector than to Ukrainian
civilians, who will undoubtedly get caught in the crossfire. The
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported that the US is
home to five of the world's ten largest defence contractors. Lockheed
Martin, by far the largest in the field, in 2017 had an estimated
US\$44.9 billion in arms contracts globally. \*image removed, caption
kept\* [More weapons will likely only inflame the conflict]{.underline}.
Shutterstock The company was also contracted (with Raytheon) in 2018 to
provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. The US Pentagon said:
"The Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense
capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to
meet its national defense requirements." But Lockheed Martin likely
profited handsomely from the deal. Meanwhile, the company's financial
reports showed fourth quarter 2018 net sales of US\$14.4 billion,
compared to US\$13.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. This year,
the company is expecting sales to grow by as much as 6%. This is
unlikely to be the case if the number of conflicts around the world
declines. It's clear why Washington wants to sell more weapons to
Ukraine. But whether Ukraine remains receptive and willing to continue
buying them may hinge on the outcome of the upcoming presidential
election, which is scheduled for March 31. Presidential candidate
Volodymyr Zelensky, who is currently leading in the polls, seems to
offer hope that Ukraine may change its current strategy. This is
reflected in a statement Zelensky made in March in which he emphasised
the need to negotiate with Russia in order to "save people's lives". Is
there a solution? As well as better diplomacy, [Zelensky also sees
direct democracy as a way to resolve the crisis]{.underline}. Rather
than pursuing the same ineffective policy, which has achieved absolutely
nothing except for a greater death toll and growing human misery, [he
proposed a referendum on the outcome of his negotiations with
Russia]{.underline} on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. [This approach
might not]{.underline} lead to a quick fix or [immediately restore
peace]{.underline} in the region -- [but it is more likely to succeed
than simply supplying more weapons with which to prolong the
fighting]{.underline}. [The West should not abandon its rhetoric of
support for Ukraine's territorial integrity]{.underline}. [But
policymakers and society more broadly should be careful not to assume
that simply selling more weapons to Ukraine will yield a]{.underline}
definitive [victory over Russia]{.underline} and its separatist allies.
While the ongoing war in the eastern Donbas region and the recent Kerch
incident offer an opportunity for big businesses to make a profit, it's
ordinary people who will pay the price. [The current approach to
deescalating the conflict needs to be dramatically reevaluated -- and
**lethal weapons must be taken off the negotiating table**]{.underline}.

#### The plan leads to [effective diplomacy]{.underline} and makes Ukraine stable enough to [independently]{.underline} fend off Russian aggression

Why is the United States once again considering the provision of lethal
defensive weapons to Ukraine? We last had this debate in 2015, when the
struggle between Kyiv and Russian-supported separatists was raging with
Russian forces themselves directly engaged, including on the ground in
the Donbas. It was uncertain how far Moscow wanted to push into Ukraine,
whether there was substance behind the talk of Novorossiya or a land
bridge to Crimea. [Supplying lethal weapons, proponents argued, would
cause Moscow to reconsider and pull back from its aggressive
designs]{.underline}. President [Obama]{.underline} ultimately [decided
against supplying the weapons]{.underline}, [convinced]{.underline} that
Ukraine was a top priority for Moscow and thus [arming
Ukraine]{.underline} was needlessly provocative. It [would only lead
Moscow to escalate the conflict to Ukraine's loss]{.underline} -- even
the best-equipped Ukrainian forces would have been no match for the
Russians -- and neither the United States nor its European allies had
any attention of inserting their own forces into the fray. [Obama's was
the right decision. It remains the right decision now, for if anything
the situation has changed in ways that make the provision of lethal
weapons only more provocative and less relevant to the struggle in the
East and the future of Russia's relations with the West and
Ukraine]{.underline}. [The conflict is]{.underline} for all practical
purposes [frozen]{.underline}, despite constant skirmishing along the
line of contact. [No significant amount of territory has changed
hands]{.underline} [since]{.underline} the battle for Debaltseve in
February [2015]{.underline}. [Moscow appears disinclined to raise the
temperature today]{.underline}. Putin's proposal for inserting UN
peacekeepers along the line of contact may be unacceptable. But at worst
it would reinforce the status quo, and [the West might yet be able to
reshape it in ways that advance a satisfactory resolution of the
crisis]{.underline}. At the same time, Ukraine remains a high priority
for Moscow, much higher than it is for the West. So what purpose is
supplying lethal defensive weapons supposed to serve? [Advocates offer
two broad reasons. First,]{.underline} as argued before, [the provision
of arms would change Moscow's calculus, eroding its position in the
Donbas and making it more amenable to serious negotiations]{.underline}
to end the conflict. [It is hard, however, to see why that would be so,
unless, contrary to all evidence, Moscow intends to push further
militarily into Ukraine or an emboldened Kyiv decides to launch an
offensive against the separatists]{.underline}, whom Moscow has no
intention of abandoning. Why else would Ukraine need to use the weapons?
But [Russian forces would easily outclass the Ukrainians.]{.underline}
[It is not even clear that Russian casualties would mount, as the
advocates insist, and certainly not to levels that would give Moscow
pause, given the stakes]{.underline}. [Second, advocates now also argue
that the provision of weapons would help build up Ukraine's capabilities
against a continuing Russian threat over the longer term. This is
undoubtedly true]{.underline}. Ukraine does need to raise a better
trained and equipped military to deal with Russia and other threats.
[But it does not necessarily need US weapons for that
purpose]{.underline}. [Ukraine has one of the largest defense-industrial
sectors in the world]{.underline}, a legacy of the Soviet period, [and
it ranks among the world's top ten arms exporters today]{.underline}.
What the sector needs is investment to enhance its efficiency and expand
the range of equipment it manufactures. Under the circumstances, it
would make more sense -- and prove less provocative -- to help Ukraine
expand and modernize the defense-industrial sector so that it could
supply the military with most of what it requires from domestic sources.
[In short, the reasons for arming Ukraine are not
compelling]{.underline}. And if the issue has emerged again it has less
to do with the situation in Ukraine than with the growing anti-Russian
animosity in the United States, fueled by Russian interference in the
2016 presidential election and concern about President Trump's fondness
for President Putin. Along with the harsher sanctions regime passed by
Congress this past summer over Trump's objections, [the provision of
lethal arms is intended to inflict more severe punishment on Russia for
its aggression and violation of international norms]{.underline}.
Whether it helps change Russia's calculus enough to bring the Ukraine
crisis to a satisfactory resolution is a secondary question for the many
who believe that punishing Russia a moral obligation. [The practical
task, however, remains solving the West's and Ukraine's Russia
problem]{.underline}. [The immediate challenge is negotiating a
resolution]{.underline} of the Donbas conflict that restores Ukraine's
sovereignty over that region and reintegrates it into Ukraine. The Minsk
Agreement provides the elements of a resolution, but by all accounts it
is unimplementable in its current form. This situation calls for a
different diplomatic approach, not one that necessarily abandons Minsk,
but rather one that disaggregates its elements and provides for an
easing of sanctions in parallel with each concrete step Moscow takes to
fulfill its part of the agreement. The diplomatic approach should also
consider a politically-binding long-term moratorium on Ukraine's
membership in NATO or the EU to dampen the geopolitical contest over
Ukraine. [As tensions in the East ease, more attention could then be
focused **building a competent and efficient Ukrainian state**, which
is]{.underline}, as history demonstrates, **[the best long-term
guarantee against any aggressive Russian designs]{.underline}**. Much
progress has been made since the Revolution of Dignity four years ago,
but much more remains to be done. In particular, the oligarchic-clan
system that has dominated politics since reemergence of an independent
Ukraine in 1991 needs to be replaced by a more open and less corrupt
system. [Needlessly arming Ukraine only **escalates tension in the
region** and **distracts attention** from the tasks that are indeed
critical to Ukraine's future]{.underline}.

If the rumors are true, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will visit
Russia in May during a commemoration of World War II in Moscow. Russian
Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora also recently confirmed
that "Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin exchange messages on a regular
basis." [On the surface it seems that a revitalized Russian--North
Korean alliance could be in the offing]{.underline}. Observing this
trend, many strategists have argued that Russia's interests in North
Korea are overwhelmingly economic, including a transcontinental railroad
and gas pipeline that would run through the nation. [But Russia's
dalliance with North Korea also fits a geopolitical pattern reminiscent
of the Cold War's early days: Great power competition with the United
States drives Russia's North Korea strategy, and diplomatic niceties
between these former communist allies disguise Russia's true
motivations.]{.underline} When U.S.--Russian relations are hostile and
confrontational, Russia moves closer to North Korea. During amicable
periods in U.S.--Russian relations, Moscow maintains a healthy distance
from Pyongyang. [U.S. policymakers interested in imposing costs on
Russia for its expansionist behaviors by **sending arms to Ukraine**
must thus recognize that **Russia's geopolitical chessboard** is
**neither limited to the Ukrainian conflict**, **nor to Europe** at
large.]{.underline} Russia will not go to war to defend North Korea in
the face of military escalation, but if U.S.--Russian relations remain
on hostile footing---which seems likely---[Russia **may return** to its
old **Cold War tactics** on the **Korean Peninsula**.]{.underline}
Russia can (and has) frustrated the United States there before, and
could easily do so again in the wake of current economic sanctions.
VINTAGE POWER POLITICS In 1968 U.S.--Soviet relations were
confrontational, yet stable. By that time, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson
was several years into a strategy of building bridges to the Soviet
Union's Eastern European client states through economic and cultural
programs intending to sever Soviet influence. [In January that year,
North Korean naval forces seized the USS Pueblo, a U.S. intelligence
collection vessel, along with its surviving 81-man crew]{.underline}.
When Secretary of State Dean Rusk approached his Soviet counterpart to
request Soviet mediation to resolve the crisis, Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko rebuffed his request. [When the United States brought the
Pueblo's seizure to the UN Security Council for action, the **Soviet
Union used its veto power to block any resolution**]{.underline}. [And
as the United States sent military reinforcements into the Korean arena,
including the USS Enterprise Carrier Strike Group, the Soviet Union
complicated matters by responding with the mobilization of Soviet
warships into the Sea of Japan, compelling Johnson to withdraw the
Enterprise]{.underline}. The United States would eventually resolve the
Pueblo crisis, but only after a year of direct negotiations with North
Korea in which it conceded to the demands that Pyongyang had laid out at
the beginning of the affair. [Against the backdrop of the Cold War
rivalry, the Soviets seemed to take a certain glee in U.S. frustrations
with North Korea]{.underline}. By contrast, as U.S.--Soviet relations
started to thaw in the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union became a crucial
partner in U.S. policy toward the Korean Peninsula. North Korea joined
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985 only because the Soviet
Union, at the United States' request, pressured it to do so. Following
improved U.S.--Soviet relations in the late 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev began improving relations with South Korea, eventually
denouncing the Soviet Union's 1961 alliance treaty with the North. By
1991, it was evident that North Korea was operating a clandestine
nuclear program, which pushed Russia to become a tacit ally with the
United States, even threatening to place its own sanctions on North
Korea if the nation did not cooperate with International Atomic Energy
Agency inspectors. During the George W. Bush administration, a period
when U.S.--Russian relations were steady and generally positive, Russia
played a constructive---if peripheral---role in the various
configurations of regional dialogue to denuclearize North Korea. As U.S.
and Russian interests increasingly diverged---from Russia's 2008 war
with Georgia to conflicts in Libya, Syria, and now Crimea---pragmatic
cooperation eventually gave way to strategic competition and renewed
rivalry. A NEW "GREAT GAME" U.S.--Russian relations are more hostile
today than at any time since the Cold War. [The United States again
finds itself debating whether and how to confront Russian aggression,
imposing economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Crimea, and
seeking to reinvigorate NATO. A public debate has ensued about whether
the United States should **send arms to Ukraine**.]{.underline} U.S.
defense intellectuals, and some within the Obama administration, have
become vocal advocates of this option. [It is within this context that
Russia is suddenly expressing an economic interest in North Korea,
increasing political exchanges between the two nations, and planning
military exercises with the North for the first time in
decades]{.underline}. Yet again, great power dynamics are driving
Russian calculations on the Korean Peninsula. [**Russian strategy toward
Asia**---and especially North Korea---is not predetermined but
**contingent upon** the country's larger relationship with the **United
States.**]{.underline} Put simply, the Cold War rivalry pattern has been
renewed: Russian relations with North Korea are good because relations
with the United States are bad. Arguments suggesting Russia's current
posture toward North Korea is driven by economic incentives alone
overlook this pattern, as economic relations with North Korea have only
flourished during periods of U.S.--Russian hostility. At any rate, North
Korea's deadbeat debtor reputation, moribund economy, and low-skill
labor pool---to say nothing of political risk and horror stories of
Chinese investments gone awry---all cast a shadow of doubt on claims
that Russia's motivations in North Korea are purely
economic[.]{.underline} [As the United States invests time and political
capital in isolating North Korea internationally, Russian debt
forgiveness, currency exchange, and trade give Pyongyang a lifeline that
**alleviates international pressure**]{.underline}. North Korea has an
interest in diversifying its external relations too, since Beijing has
started to grow weary of the nation's irresponsible international
behavior. [Putin has extended an invitation to Kim Jong Un to visit
Russia and cancelled \$10 billion of North Korean debt, as the logic of
Russia's geopolitical rivalry with the United States demands. As North
Korea's conventional military capabilities have gradually rusted away,
**Russian military aid** offers the prospect of
**rejuvenation**]{.underline}. [Russia may even see potential for North
Korea to **open up a new front of crisis** or limited conflict that
draws U.S. attention away from what it does on its European
periphery]{.underline}. Should the United States be concerned over a
renewed Russian--North Korean friendship? Yes and no. Russia's interests
in Korea are purely instrumental, and are not driven by Russia's
insecurity or ethno-historical claims to Crimea and other parts of its
near abroad. We should therefore expect a rational limit to Russia's
willingness to spend blood and treasure on North Korea. Even if Russia
formally rekindles an alliance with North Korea, which seems unlikely,
Russia can offer no credible extended deterrence because North Korea's
significance to Russia is mostly limited to being a thorn in the United
States' side. A Putin promise to fight the United States on behalf of
the North would be laughable under current circumstances. [Still, Russia
does not have to risk much in order to play **the role of spoiler** in
U.S. strategy toward Asia, of which North Korea is a major
part]{.underline}. [Russia's position in Asia, both geographically and
politically, provides it opportunities to **oppose and even undermine
the region's precarious liberal order**. On the Korean Peninsula, Russia
has a long history of disruption through **economic aid**, the
**provision of military arms**, and the **training and deployment** of
foreign military forces throughout the Cold War---minor costs if the
result is a humbled, restrained adversary]{.underline}. As U.S.
policymakers weigh whether to arm Ukraine, Russian--North Korean history
urges them to judge the benefits and risks not simply in terms of NATO,
the European theater, or the costs that Russia may pay in diplomatic and
financial capital for its actions in Crimea. [Russia's borders are not
limited to Europe, and neither are its abilities to hamper U.S.
interests, which are arguably greater in Asia than in
Ukraine.]{.underline} [Putin might be using North Korea to distract and
stoke the ire of Washington, but given the success of this strategy in
the past, it would be unwise to underestimate its
significance]{.underline}.

"It's long past time for the United States to provide Ukraine the lethal
defensive assistance it needs to deter and defend against further
Russian aggression," said Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) in August---and
not for the first time. McCain is arguably the most influential person
in Congress on national security matters, so his words carry weight. But
his is hardly a lone voice. Others, including John Herbst, who was U.S.
ambassador to Ukraine from mid-2003 to mid-2006, and Alexander Vershbow,
an experienced American diplomat and deputy general secretary of NATO
from early 2012 until October 2016, agree with McCain. So do former
President Bill Clinton's deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, and
a cluster of diplomatic and national security luminaries, who came out
of the gate early on this issue in a report released in 2015. The
efforts of these individuals haven't been in vain. U.S. President Donald
Trump will soon decide whether to implement their proposal, and key
members of his national security and military team favor doing so,
according to recent statements from General Joseph Dunford, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Kurt Volker, Trump's top negotiator on
the Ukraine crisis. Defense Secretary James Mattis has confirmed that
the option was being "actively reviewed." [Those who call for sending
lethal arms to Ukraine]{.underline} ([the United States and some of its
NATO allies already train Ukrainian troops, and the United States has
been providing nonlethal arms]{.underline} to Ukraine to the tune of
\$300 million in 2016 alone) [claim that American weaponry will
strengthen Kiev's hand and compel]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin to negotiate a just political settlement]{.underline}
that ends the war in Ukraine's Donbas region. **[They're
misguided]{.underline}**. [Worse, their proposal could be **dangerous**,
for Ukraine and the United States]{.underline}. [Arming Ukraine won't
make Putin cry uncle]{.underline}. [Past
experience]{.underline}---notably Moscow's stepped-up intervention to
save its Donbas clients in the battles for Ilovaisk and Novoazovsk in
2014 and 2015 and Debaltseve in 2015---[suggests that Putin will
continue to reinforce Russia's proxies, especially if they suffer
setbacks at the hands of better-armed Ukrainian troops]{.underline}.
Because Russia and Ukraine share a border, [Putin can send forces and
weapons to the battlefield far faster than the United States can
resupply Ukraine]{.underline}. Most importantly, [Ukraine matters far
more to Russia than to the United States]{.underline}. Indeed, even the
advocates for arming Ukraine disavow any intention to send American
troops to fight for the Ukrainians, knowing full well that such a
recommendation would doom their efforts. By contrast, Putin hasn't
hesitated to order Russian troops into battle in the Donbas, where many
have been killed. His popularity ratings nevertheless remain sky-high.
Eighty-seven percent of Russians support his handling of foreign
affairs---about the same as did in 2014. [There is no evidence that the
war in Ukraine has dented Putin's popularity, let alone enabled
opposition leaders to mobilize support against his
government]{.underline}. [Yet proponents of providing Ukraine lethal
arms suggest]{.underline} that because of the bite of Western sanctions
and Russians' mounting unhappiness with the [war, Putin desperately
wants to escape]{.underline} what they portray as [the Donbas
quagmire]{.underline}. In fact, [although Russia has now endured
political isolation and Western economic penalties for over three
years]{.underline} as a consequence of [Putin's]{.underline} annexation
of Crimea and instigation of the war in eastern Ukraine, he has [not
made a single significant concession or shown any inclination to
sacrifice the Donbas insurgents.]{.underline} Instead, he has stuck by
them and, as his military escalations in 2014 and 2015 show, bailed them
out when necessary. [The proposition that Putin won't be provoked by a
U.S. decision to send lethal arms to Ukraine amounts to a hunch. It's
not supported by evidence, and Putin's past behavior contradicts
it]{.underline}. This is not a minor point: if he does ramp up the war
and the Ukrainian army is forced into retreat, the United States will
face three bad choices. First, Washington could pour even more arms into
Ukraine in hopes of concentrating Putin's mind; but he can easily
provide additional firepower to the Donbas insurgents. Second, it could
deepen its military involvement by sending American military advisers,
or even troops, to the frontline to bolster the Ukrainian army; but then
Russia could call America's bluff. Third, the United States could decide
not to respond to Russia's escalation given the geographical
disadvantage and the limited strategic interests at stake. That would
amount to backing down, abandoning Ukraine, and shredding the
oft-repeated argument that American and European security hinges on the
outcome of the Donbas war. Proponents of arming Ukraine say that things
will never reach this point because their goal is merely to force a
political settlement that's acceptable to Ukrainians and ends a war that
has killed some 10,000 people. The point, they insist, isn't to empower
Kiev to crush the Donbas rebels, and they dismiss the possibility that
an American-armed Ukraine might be emboldened to attempt just that. Yet
in a speech at West Point in September, Ukrainian President Petro
Poroshenko declared that his intent was precisely to retake the Donbas
(a point that he also made earlier in July and again in October), and he
noted that American weapons would help him succeed. Surely, Poroshenko's
words matter more than breezy assurances from those pushing to arm
Ukraine. The supporters of arming Ukraine also shortchange that
country\'s military capabilities. The Ukrainian army has nearly doubled
in size, from 130,000 in 2014 to 250,000 today, and is now one of
Europe's largest. In 2018, Ukraine's military spending will increase by
a quarter to \$6.3 billion (or five percent of GDP), more than double
the 2014 figure. In addition to the increases in defense spending and
the size of its army, Kiev has taken other steps to beef up its
security. The draft was reinstituted in 2014. Ukraine has been improving
its command, control, surveillance, and intelligence network and
acquiring more, and better trained, special operations forces. With help
from NATO's Comprehensive Assistance Package, which was adopted in 2016,
it is revamping the administration of its armed forces. True, there are
many obstacles to transforming Ukraine's military, corruption among
them. The goal of bringing it up to NATO standards by 2020 may amount to
wishful thinking. And progress will be slow under the best of
circumstances. Yet the Ukrainian army of today is certainly not what it
was in 2014---a shell. What's more, Ukraine is no slouch in building
weapons. Ukroboronprom, the state weapons manufacturer, employs 80,000
people and oversees 21 affiliates, and there are some 36 private
Ukrainian defense firms besides. Ukraine makes advanced tanks, armored
amphibious vehicles, aerial refueling tankers, transport aircraft,
laser-guided anti-tank missiles (which get top billing in proposals to
arm Ukraine, never mind that Ukraine makes the Corsar and Stugna-P
laser-guided ATGMs), and long-range early-warning radars. Moreover,
Ukraine was the world's ninth-largest arms exporter from 2012 to 2016.
It earned over \$500 million selling arms last year and a total of \$11
billion since it became an independent country. In short, the clamor to
arm Ukraine may have less to do with its dire need for weapons than with
drawing the United States deeper into the conflict. Supporters of arming
Ukraine insist that this move is also essential for reassuring NATO and
preserving Europe's peace. Yet the proposition that the United States
should risk getting enmeshed in a war on Russia's doorstep to soothe its
skittish NATO states makes no sense. Article V of the pact's treaty
already provides that a member that comes under attack will be defended,
with military force if needed. Moreover, although Trump declared NATO
"obsolete," he later reversed himself, and there is every reason to
believe that his administration remains committed to the transatlantic
alliance. If NATO truly seeks to become stronger and Europe is indeed so
vulnerable and edgy, the alliance's wealthy European members should take
some big steps at home, such as boosting defense spending. Although some
have, many have not. The alliance's figures show that only five of its
27 European states now spend two percent or more of their GDP on
defense, the target accepted in 2006. NATO's European members also have
much work to do on other fronts. These include reducing duplication in
the production of major armaments and increasing inter-operability and
the capabilities for the rapid deployment of forces to the battlefield.
Substantial progress in these areas, not reassurances about Washington's
dependability as demonstrated by the dispatch of American arms to
Ukraine, are what the alliance needs. [The case for arming Ukraine also
tends to be **made in a vacuum**, never mind that what the United States
does in Ukraine **could determine what Russia does
elsewhere**]{.underline}. [Moscow could respond by]{.underline} putting
more pressure on the Baltics, [acting as a spoiler in **North
Korea**]{.underline} or Iran, or even arming the Taliban (that would be
an ironic turn: in the 1980s, the United States bled the Soviets by
arming the Afghan mujahideen). [If these outcomes seem impossible,
consider the United States' awful record in foreseeing the effects of
its military moves. In Vietnam, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya,
adversaries didn't respond the way Washington anticipated, or there were
dangerous unintended consequences]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline},
for its part, [surprised the United States by sending its troops into
Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and Syria in 2015]{.underline}.

All in all, [the plan to pressure Putin by providing Ukraine lethal arms
is strategically flawed]{.underline}. Worse, [it could prove
reckless]{.underline}.

long-standing interests on the Korean Peninsula and its substantial
leverage, Russia is going to **play an active role** in the ongoing
drama centered on North Korea]{.underline}. The question is what kind of
a role it will be. Most likely, Russia's behavior will gravitate to one
of the following scenarios: Scenario 1. Russia obstructs international
efforts to deal with North Korea. [This scenario is likely if Russia's
relations with the United States **become even worse** than they stand
now, with the two countries entering a new edition of a bitter Cold
War]{.underline}. In order to punish the West, rather than joining in
the US-led efforts to reign in the Kim regime, [**Moscow will extend
Pyongyang a lifeline** that **alleviates international
pressure.**\[25\]]{.underline} In extremis, [Russia can even **resume
weapons deliveries** to the DPRK, something that **Pyongyang has long
been seeking from Moscow**]{.underline}. Some elements of this scenario,
albeit in less extreme varieties, can also materialize if Russia feels
that it is being sidelined or ignored as a major player on the Korean
Peninsula. [Consider Russia's reluctance to give immediate consent to
the UNSC draft resolution imposing stiff sanctions on North Korea that
was negotiated bilaterally by the US and China in late February 2016.
Moscow expressed its displeasure over the fact that Russia's interests
were not taken into account and delayed the adoption of the
resolution]{.underline}.\[26\] Russia secured an important concession in
the final version of the resolution adopted by the UNSC on March 2,
whereby coal originating outside the DPRK (from Russia and Mongolia) and
transported for export through the North's port of Rajin is exempt from
the general coal trade ban.\[27\] This will ensure continued operation

- (from Jamestown Global Institute) Alexander Nemets is a Russian
  researcher based in the United States who specializes in Russian and
  Chinese developments in defense and military reform as well as the
  Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)

[In two articles published online this week, Moscow analyst Aleksandr
Nemets details the evidence many have assembled showing that **Moscow is
heavily involved in both the rocket program** of North Korea and
Pyongyang's **"aggressive plans"** to use it against other countries
(see "Зато они 'делают' ракеты" and "Системный подход").]{.underline}
[It is absolutely essential, he says, that South Korea, Japan and the
United States understand that everything that is now brewing in the
region is what Moscow or more precisely Putin wants" and not some rogue
action by Kim Jong Un as many imagine]{.underline}. [In the first of
these articles, Nemets traces the history of Russian deliveries of
missiles to North Korea in recent decades and the ways in which,
apparently with some Russian assistance, Pyongyang has modified
them,]{.underline} and then offers three main conclusions: First of all,
he says, "the development of the relatively primitive ballistic rocket
Hwasong-10, one that corresponds to the level of Soviet rockets of the
1960s, from the beginning in 1992 until the series of tests in 2016,
lasted 24 years." [What the North Koreans came up with was "a copy of
the Soviet R-27 rocket." Soviet R-27 (SS-N-6 Serb) SLBM and North Korean
Hwasong-10 also known as BM-25 and Musudan In some ways, it was not even
as good, but it is important to note that the Hwasong-10 does not
contain anything original," a pattern that speaks to 'the low
scientific-technical potential of North Korea,"]{.underline} [Nemets
argues. Second, he continues, "even this primitive result **would have
been impossible without very intensive Russian assistance**, especially
in 2015-2016.]{.underline} Why did Moscow feel compelled to provide
this? Obviously not for money ... Beyond any doubt, Moscow's goal was
the infliction of maximum harm on America." North Korean missile launch
with Kin Jong Un watching And third, "the Hwasong-12 ballistic rocket,
which was successfully tested in May 2017 and which has a range of more
than 4000 kilometers and is capable of striking Guam and Alaska, is a
much-improved version of the Hwasong-10, although it is based
fundamentally on the very same technologies." [Taken together, Nemets
says, all this shows that "it is **absolutely excluded** that **the weak
industrial** and scientific-technical system of North Korea could have
created the Hwasong-12 in any case so quickly. If the Russian share in
the Hwasong-10 was conditionally more than 80 percent, then in the case
of the Hwasong-12, it approached 100 percent."]{.underline} [In the
second article, the Moscow analyst broadens his focus in order to
suggest that the timing of North Korea's actions, **its missile launches
and threats** in particular, reflects less a Pyongyang calendar than a
Moscow one intended by Putin to do maximum harm to the United States.
Nemets argues that the **North Korean actions happened precisely as**
Russian-American relations were deteriorating, when **Moscow's
expectations** for a new deal with Donald Trump were replaced by a
recognition **that Washington was going to take a hard line** against
Russia for its interference in American elections and **its aggression
in Ukraine.**]{.underline} Ukrainian officials have pointed to these
links, but their words have been dismissed by many who believe that Kyiv
is simply trying to blacken Russia's reputation (and respond to Moscow's
claims that North Korea's missiles came from Ukrainian factories) in
order to win more support from the West, the Moscow analyst suggests.
But now a Russian official has implicitly made the connection between
Moscow's intentions and Pyongyang's actions, Nemets says. Sergey
Ryabkov, Russia's representative to the United Nations, said that "the
government of the Russian federation had been forced to react to the
additional dislocation of (powerful) American THAAD complexes in South
Korea and Japan that are capable of intercepting ballistic rockets." Put
in more normal language, the Moscow analyst says, this shows that
"Moscow, infuriated by the fact that \[North Korea's\] neighbors don't
approve \[Pyongyang's\] nuclear and thermonuclear tests and the launch
of rockets flying over the territory of Japan, was simply forced to do
something."

#### Further NoKo nuclear development results in a destabilizing cycle that is immune to deterrents -- that causes [Korean war]{.underline}

//Lex RA

My growing concern for years now is that [the more nuclear missiles
North Korea acquires]{.underline} (read this on just how many and when),
[the more they threaten South Korea]{.underline}'s very existence. To
date, North Korea's missile and nukes have generally been understood as
a tool for regime security -- to prevent an American 'regime change'
attack -- or as a gangsterish way for NK to shake-down SK, Japan, and
the US for concessions. As Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton both noted,
the Norks are great at selling and re-selling their nuclear program for
aid. [But, if NK gets dozens, or even hundreds, of]{.underline} nuclear
[warheads]{.underline} and missiles, then [the NK nuclear program is no
longer about regime security]{.underline} or blackmail. **[It would then
have grown into an existential threat to SK]{.underline}** as a state
and society. This is why I am such a strong supporter of THAAD. [NK is
moving from being a]{.underline} frightening [rogue state obsessed with
survival, **to a major threat**]{.underline} to the constitutional order
and even physical survival of the ROK (and Japan). To be sure, [the USSR
and US were that to each other in the Cold War]{.underline}, [but both
developed technologies]{.underline} (SLBMs mostly) [that allowed them to
survive]{.underline} (or 'ride out' in nuclear parlance) [even a massive
first strike and still retaliate]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
'assured second strike' capability [dramatically reduced the incentive
for either side to strike first]{.underline}, so stabilizing the nuclear
competition despite the huge size of the arsenals. [By contrast, neither
NK nor SK have assured second strike]{.underline} (SK might because of
the American alliance, but that's not entirely clear) **[which therefore
incentives attacking first.]{.underline}** Further, [both NK and SK are
very vulnerable to a first strike, so]{.underline} again the [incentives
to move first are high]{.underline}. [NK cannot hide its nuclear
weapons]{.underline}; it is too small and US satellite coverage too
intrusive. Nuclear [facilities are big and vulnerable, and a obvious
temptation for an allied preemptive strike]{.underline}. **[This creates
a 'use-them-or-lose-them' dilemma for Pyongyang. And this dilemma
worsens as Pyongyang builds more]{.underline}** and more, [and spends
more]{.underline} and more. [The more nukes North Korea deploys, the
greater the allied temptation to destroy them before they could be
used]{.underline} (this was American thinking during the Cuban Missile
Crisis too). [This vulnerability, in turn, **incentivizes NK to use
them** before they're struck. **It's a nasty spiral of paranoia.** SK
too is vulnerable, which again incentivizes moving first]{.underline}.
[SK cannot ride out a serious nuclear assault]{.underline}, because it
is a small, highly centralized state with a highly concentrated
population defenseless against missile attack. [It would not take
many]{.underline} nuclear [strikes to destabilize the
Republic]{.underline} (unlike the US or USSR in the Cold War). [As Nork
nukes move from a few for security, to many as a state-]{.underline} and
society-[breaking threat to SK]{.underline} (and even Japan), [the
incentives to preemptively destroy them first will grow
also]{.underline}. This is a classic nuclear security dilemma, straight
out of the Cold War in the 1950s. The best way out of this nasty,
worsening game would be nuclear restraint on the NK part (a pipe-dream,
that), and/or robust missile defense on the SK side. THAAD is really,
really important to slow the security dilemma paranoia that accompanies
arms build-ups, especially nuclear ones. The Chinese ought to think
about that before they come out so strongly against THAAD: If South
Korea is entirely 'naked' or 'roof-less' against missile attack, when NK
has 100+ nuclear missiles -- a capability that could destroy South Korea
in just a few minutes -- what does Beijing think will happen? That Seoul
will just sit back and do nothing because of trade with China? I doubt
it. [No SK president could tolerate such a stark, **asymmetric threat**
to the ROK's very existence]{.underline} just to keep the Chinese
mollified. That would border on dereliction of duty. [Even if SK did not
want to strike]{.underline} North Korea's nuclear sites (which I don't
think it does), [it might feel compelled to out of sheer
fear.]{.underline} These ideas were first fleshed out at The Diplomat
here. That essay is re-posted below and repeats the above discussion:
"As North Korea continues to develop both nuclear weapons and the
missile technology to carry them, the pressure on South Korea to take
preemptive military action will gradually rise. At some point, North
Korea may have so many missiles and warheads, that South Korea considers
that capability to be an existential threat to Southern security. [This
is the greatest long-term risk to security and stability in Korea,
arguably more destabilizing than a North Korean collapse.]{.underline}
If North Korea does not arrest its nuclear and missile programs at a
reasonably small, defensively-minded deterrent, then Southern elites
will increasingly see those weapons as threats to Southern survival, not
just tools of defense or gangsterish blackmail. During the Cold War, the
extraordinary speed and power of nuclear missiles created a bizarre and
frightening 'balance of terror.' Both the Americans and Soviets had
these weapons, but they were enormously vulnerable to a first strike.
Under the logic 'use them or lose them,' there were enormous incentives
to launch first: if A did not get its missiles out of the silos quickly
enough, they might be destroyed by B's first strike. One superpower
could then hold the other's cities hostage to nuclear annihilation and
demand concessions. This countervalue, 'city busting' temptation was
eventually alleviated by 'assured second strike' technologies,
particularly submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM). SLBMs ensured
the survivability of nuclear forces; hard-to-find submarines could ride
out an enemy first strike and still retaliate. So the military value of
launching first declined dramatically. By the 1970s, both the US and the
USSR had achieved enough survivability through various 'hardening'
efforts that nuclear bipolarity was relatively stable despite the huge
number of weapons in the arms race. The Korean nuclear race does not
have this stability and is unlikely to ever achieve it. Nuclear Korea
today is more like the cold war of the 1950s, when nuclear weapons were
new and destabilizing, than in the 1970s when they had been
strategically integrated, and bipolarity was mature. Specifically,
[North Korea will never been able to harden its locations well enough to
achieve assured second strike.]{.underline} [North Korea is too small to
pursue the geographic dispersion strategies the Soviets
tried]{.underline}, and too poor to build a reliable SLBM force or
effective air defense. [Further US satellite coverage makes very hard
for the North to conceal anything of great importance.]{.underline}
[North Korea's nuclear weapons will always be highly
vulnerable.]{.underline} [So North Korea will always face the 'use it or
lose it' logic that incentives a first strike.]{.underline} On the
Southern side, its small size and extreme demographic concentration in a
few large cities makes the Republic of Korea an easy target for a
nuclear strike. More than half of South Korea's population lives in
greater Seoul alone (more than 20 million people), and Seoul's suburbs
begin just thirty miles from the demilitarized zone. This again raises
the temptation value of a Northern strike. Both the Soviet Union and the
United States were so large, that only a massive first strike would have
led to national collapse. In South Korea by contrast, nuking only about
five large cities would likely be enough to push South Korea toward
national-constitutional breakdown. Given its extreme urbanization and
centralization, South Korea is extremely vulnerable to a WMD and/or
decapitation strike. [While]{.underline} large-scale North Korean
offensive action is highly unlikely -- [Pyongyang's elites most likely
just want to survive]{.underline} to enjoy their gangster high life --
[nuclear weapons do offer a conceivable route to Northern military
victory for the first time in decades]{.underline}: [a
first-strike]{.underline} mix of counterforce detonations [to throw the
Southern military into disarray]{.underline}; limited counter-value city
strikes to [spur social and constitutional break-down]{.underline} in
the South; followed by an invasion and occupation before the US military
could arrive in force; [and a standing threat to nuke Japan or the
United States as well should they intervene]{.underline}. Again, this is
unlikely, and I still strongly believe [an allied victory is likely even
if the North were to use nuclear weapons. But the more nukes the North
builds, the more this threat, and the 'use it or lose it' first strike
incentives, grow.]{.underline} It is for this reason that the US has
pushed South Korea so hard on missile defense. Not only would missile
defense save lives, but it would dramatically improve Southern
national-constitutional survivability. (Decentralization would also help
enormously, and I have argued for that repeatedly in conferences in
Korea, but it is unlikely.) A missile shield would lessen the
military-offensive value of North Korea's nuclear weapons, so reducing
both first-strike temptations in Pyongyang and preemptive air-strike
pressure in Seoul. Unfortunately South Korea is not hardened
meaningfully to ride-out Northern nuclear strikes. Missile defense in
South Korea has become politicized as a US plot to dominate South Korean
foreign policy (yes, really) and provoke China. (Although opinion may,
at last, be changing on this.) Air drills are routinely ignored. And no
one I know in South Korea knows where their shelters are or what to do
in case of nuclear strike. Ideally North Korea would de-nuclearize. And
we should always keep talking to North Korea. Pyongyang is so dangerous
that freezing it out is a bad idea. Talking does not mean we must be
taken advantage of by the North's regular bargaining gimmicks. But we
must admit that North Korea seems unlikely to give up its nuclear
weapons. The program goes back decades, to the 1960s. Rumor has it that
Pyongyang devoted more than 5% of GDP in the last two decades to
developing these weapons. The program continued through the 1990s, even
as more than a million North Koreans starved to death in a famine
resulting from post-Cold War economic breakdown. The North has
repeatedly lied and flim-flammed to outsiders like the ROK government
and the IAEA to keep its programs alive clandestinely. Recently Kim Jong
Un has referred to nuclear weapons as the "nation's life." [We
could]{.underline} even go a step further and [admit that a few Northern
nuclear missiles are tolerable.]{.underline} If we put ourselves in
Pyongyang's shoes, [a limited nuclear deterrent makes
sense]{.underline}. Conventionally, [North Korea is falling further and
further behind.]{.underline} No matter how big the North Korean army
gets quantitatively, it is an increasingly weak shield against high-tech
opponents. [US regime change in the Middle East has clearly incentivized
despots everywhere in the world to consider the ultimate security which
nuclear weapons provide.]{.underline} The North Koreans have openly said
that nuclear weapons ensure their post-9/11 regime security. As
distasteful as it may be to us, there is a logic to that. [A small,
defensive-minded deterrent]{.underline} -- say five to ten
warhead-tipped missiles that could threaten limited retaliation against
Southern cities -- [would be an objectively rational hedge]{.underline}
against offensive action by the US or South Korea. Indeed, this is
almost certainly what Pyongyang says to Beijing to defend its program to
its unhappy patron. [But this is the absolute limit]{.underline} of
responsible Northern nuclear deployment and probably where the DPRK is
right now. [**Further nuclear and missile development** would exceed
even the most expansive definition of North Korean security and takes us
into the realm of **nuclear blackmail, highly dangerous proliferation**,
and an **offensive first-strike capability.**]{.underline} Pyongyang
does not need, for example, the ICBM it is supposedly working on. In
this context, my greatest fear for Korean security in the next two
decades is North Korean nuclearization continuing apace, generating
dozens, perhaps hundreds of missile and warheads, coupled to rising
South Korean paranoia and pressure to preemptively strike. [There is no
possible national security rationale for Pyongyang to keep deploying
beyond what it has now]{.underline}, and if they do, expect South Korean
planners to increasingly consider preemptive airstrikes. North Korea
with five or ten missiles (some of which would fail or be destroyed in
combat) is terrible humanitarian threat, but not an existential one to
South Korea (and Japan). South Korea could ride out, perhaps, five urban
strikes, and Japan even more. [But a North Korea with dozens of nuclear
missiles]{.underline}, [possibly one hundred, some of them on
submarines, would constitute a state- and society-breaking,
constitutional threat]{.underline} to South Korea and Japan in case of
conflict. That in turn will incentivize pre-emptive airstrikes. [This
spiral of paranoia]{.underline} between North Korea nuclearization, [and
pressure]{.underline} on Seoul (or even Tokyo) to preemptively defang
North Korea before it can threaten state-destruction, is entirely
predictable -- and the reason why everyone, even China and Russia, wants
North Korea to stop building. Let's hope they listen (but they won't)."

#### That's sufficient to trigger nuclear winter

**Hayes** **9** (Peter; Professor of International Relations -- RMIT
University AND Michael HAMEL-GREEN ; Dean and Professor of Arts,
Education and Human Development -- Victoria University, "The Path Not
Taken, The Way Still Open: Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and
Northeast Asia,"
<http://www.nautilus.org/projects/A-J-disarm/research-workshop/drafts/hayes-hamel-green.pdf>)

The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by
the [[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} developments, and related
political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast
Asian region but also for the whole international community. At worst,
there is the possibility of nuclear next-use1 or even an actual nuclear
exchange, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident. On
the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are relatively
close, well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is
likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a
population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border)
11 million, and Japan over 130 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange
would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. But the
catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New
research is indicating that [even a limited nuclear [war]{.mark} in the
region [would **rearrange**]{.mark} **our [global climate]{.mark} far
[more quickly than global warming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Westberg draws
attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear
exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by
comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys
warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads
equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies
indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease
in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8
years.3 In Westberg's view: That is not global winter, but the nuc[[lear
darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during
the last 1000 years]{.underline}]{.mark}. The temperature over the
continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A
decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow...The period
of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production
than 5% and it will continue for many years\...[hundreds of
[millions]{.mark} of people [will die]{.mark} from
hunger]{.underline}...To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke
injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the
Earth's protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only
consequences. Whoever uses nuclear weapons in Korea, and especially the
first-user, is doomed to possibly win a battle but will certainly lose
the political and psychological war, especially among Koreans. Reactors
might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation
effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear
next-use. [Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. [The
direct impacts]{.mark}, and the follow-on impacts [on the global
economy]{.mark} via ecological and food insecurity, [could make]{.mark}
the [present]{.mark} global financial [crisis]{.mark} pale by
comparison]{.underline}. How the great powers, especially the nuclear
weapons states respond to [[such a crisis]{.mark},]{.underline} and in
particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear
first-use, [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} make or [[break]{.mark} the
global [non prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} and disarmament
[regimes]{.underline}. [[There could be]{.mark} many unanticipated
impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent
[nuclear breakout]{.mark} and geopolitical turbulence]{.underline},
including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in
the chaos of nuclear war, [and aftermath chain-reaction affects
involving other potential proliferant states]{.underline}. The Korean
nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global
one that warrants priority consideration from the international
community.

#### The internal link is reverse causal \-\-- Russia can either [spoil or facilitate]{.underline} negotiations

**Economy 18** -- PhD @ U Michigan, Senior Fellow and Director for Asia
Studies @ CFR (Elizabeth, "Russia's Role on North Korea: More Important
than You Might Think," Council on Foreign Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/russias-role-north-korea-more-important-you-might-think)//BB>

[In the context of resolving the North Korean nuclear
challenge]{.underline}, Russia rarely makes the news. South Korea is the
reverse image; China is the enabler; the United States is the tough guy;
and Japan is a one-man band seeking the return of its abductees. [What
role]{.underline}, then, [does Russia play?]{.underline} In fact,
[Russia plays a **critical** role as a behind-the-scenes negotiator,
spoiler, and unholy ally]{.underline}. **[It is]{.underline}** not front
and center, but it is **[central]{.underline}**. The Negotiator:
[Moscow's greatest strength is its relatively equal relationship with
both North Korea and South Korea]{.underline}. While the United States,
Japan, and China maintain closer ties with one side of the demilitarized
zone (DMZ) or the other, [Russia has maintained steady economic and
political relations with both sides of the DMZ]{.underline}. Over the
years, as journalist Samuel Ramani has noted, [Moscow has sought to
carve out its own unique role in the negotiation process, encouraging
inter-Korean diplomacy as the primary means of resolving the
conflict]{.underline}. Like China, Russia has called on South Korea to
downgrade its military relations with the United States, advocating that
Seoul reject deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
missile system and referring to it as a threat to Russian security. At
the same time Putin has publicly proclaimed North Korea's nuclear
program a "threat to security in North-east Asia" and has urged the DPRK
to refrain from provocative actions. While there is no evidence that
[Russia]{.underline}'s negotiation efforts have proved decisive at any
juncture, at the very least, it [appears to have the ear of both
parties]{.underline}. The Spoiler: Its efforts to help bring about
resolution through inter-Korean diplomacy notwithstanding, Russia also
pursues its own interests, even when they are at odds with other major
actors. It has been a relatively unenthusiastic participant in
sanctioning North Korea. As President Trump pushed ever-tougher
sanctions through the United Nations Security Council, he accused Russia
of violating the sanctions to aid North Korea. Russia watered down UN
sanctions that sought to repatriate North Korean workers in order to
shut down the flow of money back to the DRPK; and some of its companies
have been sanctioned for attempting to evade sanctions on the provision
of energy to Pyongyang. Russia's aversion to sanctioning North Korea
likely has several sources: it does not believe that the sanctions will
produce change in the DPRK's behavior; it does not want to be seen as
simply following the lead of the United States; and, as the target of
international sanctions itself, it does not want to support sanctions as
matter of policy. The Unholy Ally: Ultimately, Russia's most important
and often overlooked role with regard to North Korea may be its shared
willingness to use chemical weapons. While the United States and the
rest of the world have focused attention on addressing the nuclear
threat posed by North Korea, North Korea's stockpile of chemical weapons
and failure to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention also pose a
significant threat to global security. In what was widely suspected to
be a DRPK government plot, VX nerve agent was used in the killing of Kim
Jong-un's half-brother in Malaysia; and Russia, itself, stands accused
of using chemical weapons as a means of individual assassinations
(despite being a signatory to the treaty). In addition, over the past
two years, Russia has backed the Syrian government in its denials of
chemical weapons use, and worked assiduously to prevent UN condemnations
or western military action in response. As President Trump and Chairman
Kim meet in Singapore, Russia is unlikely to be leading cheers from the
sidelines. Like China, it has its own set of complicated interests with
regard to North Korea that do not align fully with those of the United
States. Yet **[Moscow cannot be ignored]{.underline}**. [Despite its
relatively low public profile as a player in the North Korea
negotiations, Russia's behind-the-scenes ability to throw a wrench in
the process **should not be underestimated**]{.underline}. And perhaps
even more important, it will be an essential player in any future
discussions around North Korea's chemical weapons stock.

## SOLVENCY

### S

#### Strategic restraint solves escalation without triggering absolute appeasement

**DePetris 18** -- MA in Political Science @ Syracuse, fellow at Defense
Priorities (Daniel, "It is a mistake to arm Ukraine," Defense News,
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/03/12/it-is-a-mistake-to-arm-ukraine/)//BB>

[After a lengthy policy review]{.underline} and a considerable amount of
discussion, [the White House decided]{.underline} in December
[to]{.underline} [overturn the previous administration's position on
U.S. weapons sales to Ukraine]{.underline}, an arms exporter.
[Washington would now approve lethal defensive weapons systems to Kiev
ostensibly in order to improve Ukraine's ability to defend itself
against Russian-backed separatists]{.underline} operating in the east of
the country. The State Department announced the first significant sale
March 1 of 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launchers with an
estimated value of \$47 million. Some leaders in Washington have
advocated for the sale of missiles to damage or destroy Russian tanks in
eastern Ukraine ever since Moscow intervened in its neighbor's affairs.
[These weapons]{.underline}, however, [will have no impact on the
fighting beyond a front line that has been mostly static for
years]{.underline}. [Beyond the battlefield, however, this will further
**poison** whatever bilateral relationship the U.S. has left with
Russia]{.underline} --- [and that is bad]{.underline} for America.
[Sending arms to Ukraine is far more likely to escalate a conflict whose
outcome is vital to Russia's national security interest and, at best,
peripheral to America's]{.underline}. While deterring more violence in
eastern Ukraine may be the stated objective, [shipping advanced weapons
into a conflict zone is bound to end up badly for Ukrainians --- who
simply want the violence to end --- and for the United States, a country
that should not be plunging into another tangential foreign policy
commitment]{.underline}. [At every point in the conflict when Kiev's
army was advancing]{.underline} on the ground, Russian President
Vladimir [Putin responded by pouring more military equipment, money and
Russian military personnel into the Donbass on behalf of the
separatists]{.underline}. The reason Moscow has responded in such a way
to prevent a complete separatist collapse is realpolitik, plain and
simple: [Ukraine's political loyalties are immensely important to
Russia]{.underline}. [It is simply inconceivable for Putin to allow a
large neighboring state]{.underline} --- that has historically been a
connective tissue to the old Russian empire and the Soviet Union --- [to
drift closer to Europe and act antagonistic toward Moscow. This is a
strategic vulnerability for Russia]{.underline}, and one that he relies
on as a buffer from perceived encroachment by liberal internationalists.
Many in the West scoff at the idea that Russia's desire for pliant
neighbors or a strategic sphere of influence justifies its violation of
Ukraine's territorial integrity. And indeed, these voices certainly have
a point; was it not for Moscow's military support in the form of
hundreds of tanks, armor, air defense systems and intelligence assets,
Ukraine's war would likely be over and the Ukrainian military would be
combing the Donbass today and reasserting Kiev's control. Policymakers
in the West rightly disapprove of Russia's actions, and we should not
excuse Moscow's policy. But [our responsibility is to understand why the
Russians are doing what they are doing so we can make informed,
strategic decisions about how and where we must push back against them
--- the answer is not everywhere and always]{.underline}.
[Moscow]{.underline}, like Washington, [wants to be the dominant power
in the region]{.underline}. [Weapons shipments to Kiev]{.underline}, in
the view of the Kremlin, [are a hostile act designed to jeopardize
Moscow's national security and pressure Russia]{.underline}. [To the
extent that this view continues to prevail, the Kremlin will react
forcefully and retaliate. This fundamental truth must factor into
Washington's decision-making]{.underline}. At its heart, [international
politics is about strategic competition]{.underline} between states. It
is a cutthroat game that forces all countries, including the United
States, to make wise, informed decisions about which battles are in the
national interest to fight and which are left for the region itself to
manage. [Picking a fight with a declining, nuclear power over Ukraine is
**the exact opposite** of wise]{.underline}; remember, [Ukraine is not
an ally. Russia has so much more at stake in the outcome than the U.S.,
so the former will always be more willing to make the necessary
sacrifices to achieve its desired political end state.]{.underline} In
many respects, the Trump administration's decision to send anti-tank
missiles to Kiev is a perfect example of Washington's reactionary,
rather than strategic, foreign policy. [Sometimes it is appropriate for
the United States to respond harshly to Russian behavior, notably when
the malignant behavior conflicts with our vital interests]{.underline}
--- our security, prosperity and our republic. [When no vital interests
are at stake, however, it is more appropriate to collaborate with Moscow
in an attempt to resolve a dispute diplomatically.]{.underline} And in
still other areas --- strategic arms control, for instance --- the U.S.
and Russia have a responsibility to work together in order to promote
mutual understanding between the two nations. [The bipartisan foreign
policy establishment in Washington ought to adopt a page out of the
realist textbook]{.underline}: [Intervening in peripheral conflicts that
are separate from America's core national security interests is a drain
on America's limited resources and a **dangerous step toward unnecessary
confrontation**]{.underline}. **[It's]{.underline}** past **[time to
start]{.underline}** taking advice from those who counsel more
**[restraint]{.underline}** in national security decision-making.

\*\*\*Chrzanowski says 'forgo\[\] any future sale' but keep electronic
warfare and advise-and-train. If they say 'you don't do the other 2/3 of
the recommendation,' these cards say that the other 2/3 are the squo.

#### Electronic warfare commitments remain after the aff

**Roblin 18** -- Sebastien, "Why Is the Trump Administration Selling
Giant Sniper Rifles to Ukraine?," *War Is Boring*,
<https://warisboring.com/why-is-the-trump-administration-selling-giant-sniper-rifles-to-ukraine/>

However, [Trump did not want to "give" weapons to Ukraine as aid---he
saw it as a means for U.S. manufacturers to make a sale]{.underline}.
However, while Kiev would eagerly accept a donation of hundreds of
arguably the best anti-tank missiles available, it wouldn't want to pay
for a lot of top-shelf hardware as the government is strapped for cash,
and more cost-efficient missiles will likely suffice. Indeed, Ukraine is
attempting to ramp up manufacturing of heavier Stugna and more portable
Corsar anti-tank missiles, which can be produced at much lower cost.
These factors may explain the odd decision to approve the export
licenses for small quantities of arms. The Trump administration, always
looking for ways to undo Obama-era policies, was keen to demonstrate its
willingness to flout his predecessor's caution and provide lethal
weapons to Kiev, but didn't want to to give enough to seriously change
the balance of power and possibly elicit Russian retaliation. However,
the M107 license was too obviously of marginal consequence to be
credible, which may explain why a few days after announcing the M107
deal while excluding the Javelin, the administration apparently reversed
itself and also issued a Javelin license---even though it was curtailed
to just 35 launcher-units. Because importing Javelins had been accorded
such symbolic importance, Kiev was willing to pay for a small quantity
of pricey anti-tank missiles in the hopes it will encourage other NATO
countries to provide lethal military assistance. For example, Canada has
also green-lit arms sales to Ukraine. In the end, [the U.S. was already
and is still giving "free" training and non-lethal hardware---namely,
electronic warfare and communications systems as well as counterbattery
radars]{.underline}---[which are much more desperately
needed]{.underline} by the Ukrainian military according to most
commentators. [While providing big guns]{.underline} like the M107
[draws attention]{.underline}, and even arguably has a certain tactical
rationale, [it's]{.underline} likely [less important than **ongoing
transfers** intended to enable Ukrainian troops to resist Russian
jamming, hacking and drones]{.underline}.

[U.S. special operations forces have also been deeply involved in
training their Ukrainian counterparts]{.underline}. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst
said during the hearing that she recently traveled to the country to
spend time with [Ukraine's "brand-new special operations
forces]{.underline} that just [graduated from their Ukrainian Q Course,
which is run by our American special operations forces]{.underline}."
Ernst visited a training center in Berdychiv, Ukraine, [where U.S. and
Ukrainian SOF work closely to improve recruitment, retention, training,
and overall military tactics,]{.underline} according to a statement from
her offices regarding the February trip. The EUCOM commander said that
[Ukraine has been asking for help in other areas, as well]{.underline},
including support for counter-battery systems to defeat enemy indirect
fire, sniper systems, grenade launchers, ammo and even help developing a
secure communications network. "[They've asked us for help in
communication at an operational level]{.underline},\" Scaparrotti said.
\"And they do have a distinct need for that because while we focus on
the line of contact, their chief of defense is also focused on other
areas of the country that are a threat."

### S -- AT US gives

#### Trump won't let that fly

[The United States completed its shipment of Javelin anti-tank
missiles]{.underline} to Ukraine on Monday, [finalizing a sale that
was]{.underline} reluctantly [approved by]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} in November. The deal was widely reported as a
rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who annexed Crimea and
invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014. "This decision ... reflects our
country's longstanding commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing
Russian aggression," Republican Senator Bob Corker said late last year.
But the terms of the arrangement show it may be more bark than bite. The
weapons "have been delivered to a secure facility in Ukraine, not on the
line of conflict," Kurt Volker, the U.S. Special Representative for
Ukraine, told me. He did not elaborate further, but The Wall Street
Journal reported in January that the weapons would be stored in training
centers in western Ukraine that will be monitored by American soldiers.

Trump has said repeatedly that "no one is tougher on Russia" than him.
But his critics have accused him of challenging Putin only
superficially. Shortly after the Trump administration expelled 60
Russian diplomats in March---48 of whom were actually intelligence
officers, according to a State Department spokesperson---the State
Department acknowledged that the Kremlin would be allowed to refill the
vacated positions. The Treasury Department recently sanctioned more than
three dozen Russian oligarchs, officials, and entities who "profit" from
Russia's "malign activity" and "corrupt system." But many of the
sanctioned oligarchs had four months' notice to move their money, thanks
to a list of Russia's wealthiest individuals released by the Treasury in
January. That money might already be back in Russia. "As they say, 'a
barking dog cannot hinder a caravan's journey,'" Putin told Russia's
TASS news agency at the time. He mocked his own absence from the list.
When UN Ambassador Nikki Haley announced new sanctions against Russia
over its support for embattled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, she was
contradicted by the White House hours later. "There is confusion about
the Putin-Trump relationship," Major General Volodymyr Havrylov,
Ukraine's defense attaché to the U.S., told me last month. "And an
element of unpredictability. But we believe in checks and balances in
the United States." Former National-Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed for Trump to approve the lethal
weapons sale to Ukraine, according to Havyrlov and another U.S. official
familiar with the deal who requested anonymity to discuss it freely.
Trump was convinced, at least in part, by the fact that President Barack
Obama---to whom Trump frequently compares himself---had balked at the
sale. The official relayed a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian
President Petro Poroshenko last year in which Trump asked why Obama had
"done nothing when Russia invaded Crimea." (Obama sanctioned Russia over
the incursion in 2014.) [Trump, ever transactional, also wanted to make
sure he was **not giving away something for nothing**]{.underline}. [The
U.S. official said it was emphasized to the president that this would be
a sale, not a gift]{.underline}, and Poroshenko won favor with Trump by
facilitating an \$80 million coal deal---the first between the U.S. and
Ukraine---that was politically expedient for both leaders. In February,
Ukrainian Railways signed a \$1 billion locomotive deal with GE
Transportation. Trump had promised during the campaign to revitalize the
U.S. rail industry. "The Trump administration is very much focused on
jobs creation," said Daniel Vajdich, the president of the strategic
advisory firm Yorktown Solutions. "So, naturally, Ukraine has thought
about its ability to help create jobs for Americans in the context of
creating leverage by feeding into Trump's policy desires." A
Ukrainian-American lobbyist who spoke to me on condition of anonymity
put it more bluntly: "Poroshenko has become a hostage of Trump," he told
me.

### S - AT new prez solves peace

#### Absolutely not

Adam **Lammon 6/27**/19, assistant managing editor at the National
Interest, graduate of George Washington University\'s Elliott School of
International Affairs, "Will Ukraine Begin a New Dialogue With Moscow?",
National Interest, June 27 2019,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/will-ukraine-begin-new-dialogue-moscow-64606

[Is there a possibility for a fresh start in Ukraine that would push
for]{.underline} a fight against corruption, reforms, and a [dialogue
with Moscow]{.underline}---all of which polls indicate are backed by the
vast majority of voters who supported the candidacy of Volodymyr
Zelensky for the presidency? A luncheon discussion at the Center for the
National Interest on Thursday surveyed whether Zelensky will indeed be
able to translate his electoral success into a breakthrough on
negotiations with Russia. [The panelists were Samuel Charap, a senior
political scientist at the RAND Corporation who has served on the Policy
Planning staff during the Obama administration, Keith Darden, an
associate professor at American University's School of International
Service, and Jacob Heilbrunn, the editor of the National
Interest]{.underline}. The [event was moderated by George Beebe, vice
president and director of studies at the Center for the National
Interest, and a former chief Russia analysis at the CIA as well as a
White House aide during the George W. Bush administration.]{.underline}
While a **[settlement currently remains a distant
aspiration]{.underline}**, the panelists had mostly good news to share
about Europe's most fractious conflict. It is "remarkable," said Keith
Darden, that, after five years of war, Ukraine is "not dealing with a
Balkans scenario, where war has polarized the Ukrainian population and
has made reconciliation impossible." He continued: "In many ways, this
election put the lie to the caricature that was circulating about
Ukraine both here and in European capitals, which was that a country
that was united in its resistance to Russia---engaging in consensual
nation-building, reviving its national language, creating a unified
Orthodox church that was autocephalous and separated from Moscow, and
working as hard as it possibly could to separate itself from the Russian
Federation and unwilling to yield . . . on its territorial integrity or
on any matters of potential compromise with the Russian aggressors."
Instead, Darden said, what we are seeing is that "the Ukrainian people
have positive attitudes toward Russia," and retain "brotherly"
sentiments towards the Russian people. To support this assertion, as
well as to lend credibility to Zelensky's push for reconciliation with
Russia, Charap referred to public polling in Ukraine that suggested a
softening of views among the Ukrainian people. According to Charap, a
May poll found that "75 percent of Ukrainians are in favor of direct
negotiations with Russia for restoring peace to the Donbass" and "55
percent are in direct negotiations with separatist leaders for the same
purpose." Further polling reported that "65 percent of respondents said
that Ukraine should make compromises in order to restore peace and
return lost territories" to Ukraine and that "about 50 percent of
Ukrainians support giving autonomy to the separatist regions in order to
achieve a settlement," which Charap noted is "one of the conditions of
the Minsk agreements." [Yet while Zelensky was elected on a platform of
compromise with Russia and public support seems to be firmly on his
side, other **problems restricting his political latitude
remain**]{.underline}. Referring to an incident where the [Ukrainian
foreign minister rejected a Russian proposal to negotiate over Ukrainian
sailors detained in the Kerch Strait]{.underline} crisis without
informing the president, [Charap said that Zelensky "**doesn't really
have full control over his own government**."]{.underline} This
sentiment extends beyond the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
the Ukrainian parliament, known as the Verkhovna Rada, as well. Since
this Rada was elected under the previous president, Petro Poroshenko, in
the immediate aftermath of the Euromaidan protests in 2014, Darden
contends that it is now "completely unrepresentative of the population
and popular attitudes at this point and are almost universally going to
be thrown out of their seats" during the next election on July 21. Thus
far, these [internal dynamics have made Zelensky less effective than he
could otherwise be, **creating the perception in Moscow that the
Ukrainian leader is not in a position to negotiate fundamental
changes**]{.underline} to the status quo, even if he could be later in
the summer. Furthermore, Charap observed, [Russia is **aware** that on
most key foreign-policy issues, Zelensky's positions are "**largely the
same" as those of his more anti-Russia predecessor**]{.underline}. Under
Zelensky, [Ukraine has neither changed its stance on favoring European
Union and NATO membership, nor its more general concerns with Russian
foreign policy]{.underline} or its opposition to the German-Russian Nord
Stream 2 pipeline. Turning to European perceptions and the Ukrainian
relationship with Europe, Heilbrunn said that Zelensky should not feel
confident with recent European moves to begin a process of Russian
reintegration into the continent. For Heilbrunn, the drivers of this
reintegration are twofold. First, as epitomized by Moscow's return to
the Council of Europe, some Europeans---especially in France, Germany,
and Italy---want to improve relations with Russia to restart bilateral
trade. Offering the example of Germany, Heilbrunn reported that "87
percent of the members of the Russian-German chamber of commerce
indicated that they want Merkel to take a more active role in promoting
economic activity with Moscow." The second driver is the United States
and the Trump administration. According to Heilbrunn, Donald Trump's
targeted rhetoric on the United States' European allies, such as calling
Germany a "captive of Russia" over the Nord Stream 2 deal, is pushing
some European countries like Germany and France to "crabwalk" towards
more independence from America. Much like how Germany and France are
permitting Russia back into the European political architecture, Beebe
said that the United States is following a similar path: "President
Trump had canceled a planned meeting with President \[Vladimir\] Putin
several months ago specifically over Russia's detention of the Ukrainian
seaman, saying that he would not meet with Putin until such time as
those seaman had been returned, and yet this meeting is going on
nonetheless, although Russia continues to detain them." Noting that
[Russia has an **outsized and decisive influence** over the Ukrainian
separatists operating in the Donbass]{.underline}, Christopher Anderson,
a U.S. State Department employee who worked with the U.S. Special
Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker, asked "[**What more can be
done** to get peace \[between Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}\] . . .
\[[given\] Russia's goal to have an autonomous republic of Donetsk and
Luhansk with a veto over Ukrainian foreign policy]{.underline}?"

## RUSSIA WAR

### L - US-Russia war

#### US involvement in Ukraine uniquely risks direct conflict -- even a low-level confrontation escalates rapidly

Global Policy Institute, interviewed by Ann Garrison, on 12-14-2018,
\"The Latest Odds of a Hot War Between NATO and Russia,\" MintPress
News,
<https://www.mintpressnews.com/the-latest-odds-of-a-hot-war-between-nato-and-russia/252985/)SEM>

George Szamuely is a Hungarian-born scholar and Senior Research Fellow
at London's Global Policy Institute. He lives in New York City. I spoke
to him about escalating hostilities on Russia's Ukrainian and Black Sea
borders and about Exercise Trident Juncture, NATO's massive military
exercise on Russian borders which ended just as the latest hostilities
began. Ann Garrison: George, [the hostilities between Ukraine, NATO, and
Russia continue to escalate]{.underline} in the Sea of Azov, the Kerch
Strait, and the Black Sea. [What do you think the latest odds of a
shooting war between NATO and Russia are]{.underline}, if one hasn't
started by the time this is published? George Szamuely: Several weeks
ago, when we first talked about this, I said 60 percent. Now I'd say,
maybe [**70 percent**. The problem is that Trump seems determined to be
the anti-Obama]{.underline}. Obama, in Trump's telling, "allowed" Russia
to take Crimea and to "invade" Ukraine. Therefore, it will be up to
Trump to reverse this. Just as he, Trump, reversed Obama's policy on
Iran by walking away from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,
otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal. So **[expect ever-increasing
US involvement in Ukraine.]{.underline}** AG: [NATO's Supreme
Commander]{.underline} US General Curtis M. Scaparrotti [is reported to
have been on the phone with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko
"offering his full support]{.underline}." Thoughts on that? GS: [There
has been a proxy war within Ukraine since 2014]{.underline}, with NATO
backing Poroshenko's Ukrainian government and Russia backing the
dissidents and armed separatists who speak Russian and identify as
Russian in Ukraine's southeastern Donbass region. But in the Kerch
Strait **[the hostilities are between Russia and Ukraine, with NATO
behind Ukraine. A shooting war will begin if it escalates to where NATO
soldiers]{.underline}** shoot and **[kill Russian soldiers or vice
versa. Whoever shoots first, the other side will feel compelled to
respond, and then there'll be a war between Russia and
NATO]{.underline}** or Russia and a NATO nation. We don't know whether
NATO would feel compelled to respond as one [if Russians fired on
soldiers of individual NATO nations]{.underline}---most likely UK
soldiers since the UK is sending more of its Special Forces and already
has the largest NATO military presence in Ukraine. [Russia could defeat
the UK, but if the US gets involved, all bets are off.]{.underline} AG:
It's hard to imagine that the US would allow Russia to defeat the UK.
GS: It is, but on the other hand, the US is the US and the UK is the UK.
The United States might well be ready to fight to the last Brit, much as
the United States is definitely ready to fight to the last Ukrainian.
There are already 300 US paratroopers in Ukraine training Ukrainians,
but the British would be well advised that words of encouragement from
Washington don't necessarily translate into US willingness to go to war.
AG: The US Congress passed a law that [US troops can't serve under any
foreign command, so that would require US command.]{.underline} GS: Yes,
and without that, any British military defeat could be blamed on
traditional British military incompetence rather than US weakness or
foolish braggadocio. AG: This latest dustup between the Russian and
Ukrainian navies took place in the Kerch Strait. I had to study several
maps to understand this, but basically neither Russian nor Ukrainian
vessels, military or commercial, can get to or from the Sea of Azov and
the Black Sea without passing through the Kerch Strait. That doesn't
mean that neither could get to the Black Sea, because both have Black
Sea borders, but they couldn't get from ports in the Sea of Azov to the
Black Sea and back. And neither Ukraine nor Russia can get from the
Black Sea to Western European waters without passing through the
Bosporous and Dardanelles Straits in Turkey to the Aegean and
Mediterranean Seas, and then further to the Atlantic Ocean through the
Strait of Gibraltar, which is bordered on one side by Spain and the
British territory of Gibraltar, and on the other by Morocco and the
Spanish territory Ceuta. So there are many geo-strategic choke points
where Russian ships, naval or commercial, could be stopped by NATO
nations or their allies, and Ukraine has already asked Turkey to stop
them from passing through the Bosporus Strait. Thoughts on that? GS:
Well, of course Ukraine can ask for anything it likes. There's no way in
the world Turkey would try to stop Russian ships going through the
Bosporus Strait. That would be a violation of the 1936 Montreux
Convention and an act of war on the part of Turkey. It isn't going to
happen. As for the Kerch Strait, it is Russian territorial water.
Ukraine is free to use it and has been doing so without incident since
2014. The only thing the Russians insist on is that any ship going
through the strait use a Russian pilot. During the recent incident, the
Ukrainian tug refused to use a Russian pilot. The Russians became
suspicious, fearing that the Ukrainians were engaged in a sabotage
mission to blow up the newly constructed bridge across the strait.
You'll remember that an American columnist not so long ago urged the
Ukrainian authorities to blow up the bridge. That's why the Russians
accuse Kiev of staging a provocation. AG: There's a longstanding back
channel between the White House and the Kremlin, as satirized in Dr.
Strangelove. Anti-Trump fanatics keep claiming this is new and
traitorous, but it's long established. Obama and Putin used it to keep
Russian and US soldiers from firing on one another instead of the
jihadists both claimed to be fighting in Syria. Kennedy and Khrushchev
used it to keep the Bay of Pigs crisis from escalating into a nuclear
war. Shouldn't Trump and Putin be talking on that back channel now, no
matter how much it upsets CNN and MSNBC? GS: Well, of course, they
should. [The danger is that in this atmosphere of anti-Russian
hysteria]{.underline} such [channels for dialogue may not be kept
open]{.underline}. As a result, **[crises could escalate beyond the
point at which either side could back down]{.underline}** without losing
face. [What's terrifying is that so many US politicians and press now
describe any kind of negotiation, dialogue, or threat-management as
treasonous collusion by]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline}.
Remember Trump's first bombing in Syria in April 2017. Before he
launched that attack, Trump administration officials gave advance
warning to the Russians to enable them to get any Russian aircraft out
of harm's way. This perfectly sensible action on the part of the
administration---leave aside the illegality and stupidity of the
attack---was greeted by Hillary Clinton and the MSNBC crowd as evidence
that the whole operation was cooked up by Trump and Putin to take
attention off Russia-gate. It's nuts.

#### US-Russia conflict in Ukraine risks [spiraling]{.underline} to nuclear confrontation -- it's uniquely likely now

**[US--Russian relations have been in a downward spiral
since]{.underline}** Vladimir **[Putin took the fateful decision to
invade Crimea]{.underline}** in February 2014. More than two years
later, [the situation is as grave as it has been since the heated days
of the Cold War]{.underline}, in the early 1980s. Russia and the United
States are fighting a proxy war in Syria in all but name. Meanwhile,
Moscow, still furious after the downing of a Russian bomber in November
2015, seems to be on the brink of war with Turkey, a NATO ally of the
United States. [Bilateral diplomatic channels]{.underline} remain open
and even active, but they [have done little to alleviate the tensions.
In the West, distrust of Russia and fear of its aggressive
unpredictability means that any concession to Russia inspires fierce
accusations of appeasement]{.underline} (Macdonald 2015 Macdonald, A.
2015.). In Russia, a sense of historical grievance supports an
authoritarian strongman who revels in his willingness to take risks and
to assert Russia's still potent military strength. [This confrontation
is quickly becoming a new Cold War]{.underline}. For Russian Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it already is; as he put it in his remarks at
the Munich Security Conference in February, "We have slid into a time of
a new Cold War" (Meyer, Wishart, and Biryukov 2016 Meyer, H., I.
Wishart, and A. Biryukov. 2016). No two wars, hot or cold, are the same,
and a new Cold War will differ greatly from the old. But **[this new
conflict is shaping up to be extraordinarily dangerous, entailing a
broad confrontation that will play out in various proxy theaters around
the world and bringing back the ever-present possibility of nuclear
war]{.underline}** (Charap and Shapiro 2015). President Obama has stated
his intention to avoid a new Cold War. But he has also demonstrated
little interest in addressing the core issue in the dispute, namely the
regional order in post-Soviet Europe and Eurasia. The administration
has, since the Russian invasion of Crimea in February 2014, been
attempting to follow this "middle way." [Rather than outright
confrontation, the middle way is defined by maintaining cooperation with
Russia on key global issues]{.underline} that require Moscow's
involvement, such as the Iranian nuclear issue. [At the same time, the
administration is keeping up the pressure on Russia over its actions in
Ukraine]{.underline}. The middle way is based on a calculus that a new
Cold War can be avoided without having to negotiate with Russia about
the regional order on its periphery. The middle illusion A year ago, we
warned that [the middle way could not last]{.underline} (Charap and
Shapiro 2015); political and bureaucratic **[factors on both sides would
force ever-greater confrontation]{.underline}**. We argued that [it will
become politically untenable for the United States to maintain
cooperation on global issues with Russia while explicitly seeking to
counter it in Ukraine]{.underline}. This dual-track approach --
condemning Russia as an aggressor one day, and seeking to work with
Moscow the next -- creates regular opportunities for Obama's critics to
decry him as weak and feckless. Meanwhile, [powerful actors in both
governments will continue to link the Ukraine crisis to those aspects of
bilateral interaction that continue to function]{.underline}. And indeed
[that dynamic appears to be unfolding both in Syria and in Europe. In
Syria, the Russian intervention was in large part aimed at demonstrating
to the United States that Russia would no longer tolerate US regime
change policies in the Middle East. It is]{.underline}, in this sense,
[a forward defense against what the Russian establishment tends to see
as a global Western effort]{.underline}, running from Tripoli to Kyiv
and ultimately to Moscow, [to overthrow regimes through externally
supported democratic uprisings. **Russia took the highly escalatory,
unilateral action because it believes that the US will only take its
interests into account when it is forced to do so.** Such a step would
only have been possible after a breakdown of US--Russian relations. The
United States]{.underline}, recognizing the Russian challenge in a
region where it has long been the dominant outside power, [began a
counterescalation that sought to make Russia pay a price militarily for
its intervention]{.underline} (Shapiro and Daniels 2015). In the
meantime, the emergence of a serious Russian--Turkish clash over Syria
means that a NATO ally is now at risk of war with Russia. **[Both sides'
actions have created a dangerous possibility of further escalation,
including direct confrontation between Russia and the United
States.]{.underline}** Indeed, despite his reticence about greater
[US]{.underline} military involvement in Syria, Obama may end up taking
military action against the Assad regime not to further a particular
objective in Syria itself but rather to uphold America's global
reputation. He [is under enormous pressure]{.underline} in Washington --
even from within his own government (Entous 2016) -- [to demonstrate
that the United States is not backing down in the face of Russian
military aggression.]{.underline} In Europe, the situation is less
violent but hardly more conducive to avoiding a new Cold War. [Russia's
continual testing of NATO solidarity]{.underline}, through a series of
provocations ranging from probing air defenses with military jets to the
alleged kidnapping of an Estonian intelligence officer (Walker 2015),
has [prompted a slow but certain response from NATO and the United
States. Defense spending in both Europe and the United States is
beginning to rise in response to the new Russian challenge. The United
States will]{.underline} spend \$789 million in 2016 and \$3.4 billion
in 2017 for a special contingency fund to [expand its presence in
Eastern Europe]{.underline} (The White House 2016), including
[through]{.underline} periodic [rotations of armored and airborne
brigades to Poland and the Baltic states. This effort is intended to
reassure NATO allies and to deter Russian adventurism]{.underline}. But
[it will surely]{.underline} also [convince Moscow that the United
States is merely accelerating the post--Cold War process of **moving its
military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders**. In turn, **we can
expect further Russian military buildups** throughout its Western
Military District, including in the Kaliningrad exclave on the Baltic
Sea bordering Poland and Lithuania.]{.underline} Most frighteningly,
[the nuclear rhetoric of the Cold War seems to be
returning]{.underline}, albeit in new incarnations.
**[Russia]{.underline}**, aware of its conventional military inferiority
vis-à-vis NATO, **[has talked openly about putting nuclear weapons on
alert during the Crimea operation, has deployed nuclear-capable missiles
to Kaliningrad, and has even made nuclear threats against NATO member
states]{.underline}** (Barnes 2016). **[NATO is responding by
strengthening its deterrent]{.underline}** and promoting its plans for
ballistic missile defenses, **[which only continues the
cycle.]{.underline}**

#### Further US intervention and a failure to establish peace breeds instability and incrementally increases the risk of escalation with Russia

**Ditrych 14** (Ondrej Ditrych is a Senior Research Fellow at the
Institute of International Relations Prague and an Assistant Professor
at Charles University in Prague, 12-12-2014, \"Bracing for Cold Peace.
US-Russia Relations after Ukraine,\" [The International
Spectator](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/toc/rspe20/current):
Italian Journal of International Affairs,
<https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/03932729.2014.963958)SEM>

In this scenario, [the instability in Ukraine increases to a point where
it is possible to speak of a civil war]{.underline}. Several
sub-scenarios of such a development can be envisioned. [In the limited
intervention sub-scenario, Russia conducts a successful offensive in the
east and southeast, removing Donbas and possibly other areas that it
sees as]{.underline} conforming to the historical geographical notion of
'Novorossiya' \[[new Russia]{.underline}\] from the central authorities'
control but without annexing the region. Even so, the occupation and
creation of dependent protectorates would mean enormous economic strain
for Russia, compounded by the need to accommodate displaced populations
from the West Ukraine where 'ethnic' tensions would intensify. In
addition, [the US]{.underline} (and the EU) [would likely impose much
more severe sectoral sanctions on Russia]{.underline}, causing further
economic loss not only to Russia, but also for example to Kazakhstan,
thus possibly reducing the chances for the Eurasian Union to emerge.
Reaching its limited objectives and keen on not raising the cost of the
chosen course of action beyond the necessary, [Moscow would discontinue
its advance]{.underline}. **[But relations with Washington would further
deteriorate, the so far preserved venues of cooperation would be closed
and a potential for further crises would remain
considerable]{.underline}**. In Ukraine, after some time, Russia would
probably seek to initiate a national dialogue between the government and
the separatists it sponsors. However, this would be unlikely to yield
any results and the situation would resemble that of Georgia vis-à-vis
its separatist entities, only that, [in the Ukraine 'proper', there
would be a period of protracted instability despite the West's efforts
to mitigate it]{.underline}, and the political environment here would be
close to the 'neo-medieval model' characteristic of the cold peace
scenario (see below). This is one of the more likely futures. In an
alternative to Russia's limited engagement, **[military advance toward
Kyiv]{.underline}** and beyond the Dniepr **[can be
envisioned]{.underline}**, possibly [as a result of]{.underline} a
failure of the initial Blitzkrieg and extended campaign and the
**[resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces]{.underline}** and national
guard, or as a second stage of the limited engagement scenario on the
pretext of state failure, growing [instability]{.underline} and its
'[spillover' to the new protectorates or Transnistria]{.underline}. This
would likely result in Russia's eventual success in establishing control
over most of the country save for the westernmost areas, where an
insurgency would emerge and -- particularly if sponsored from abroad --
could be sustained for an extended period of time. [This would increase
the cost of Russia's occupation]{.underline}, which would entail not
only enormous financial transfers but also bearing the material as well
as human costs of an 'anti-terrorist operation'. The effects on
US-Russia relations of such a development would not be significantly
different from the limited engagement scenario. However, in addition to
creating more favourable conditions for the emergence of the EU's energy
union (a collective action to seek ways to eliminate dependence on
Russia's imports), Finland and Sweden would be more tempted to join the
North Atlantic Alliance, ironically bringing about an outcome that the
Kremlin wished to avoid (however unrealistic it was) in the first place:
NATO's further enlargement. Given Russia's military preponderance in
conventional capabilities and the costs of the extended intervention,
"Dugin might not be fazed by these prospects, but a rational Putin
should be", as Motyl notes. This scenario, which could alternatively be
called a 'new Cold War', is one of the less likely ones. Even less
likely is an international peacekeeping operation to respond to
Ukraine's slide into civil war. It could only operate under the auspices
of the UN or OSCE. But deep mistrust among key stakeholders, Moscow's
likely resistance to deploying any (truly) international military force
in its 'near neighbourhood' and, in the case of the OSCE, also a lack of
capabilities appear to be nearly decisive factors preventing such
collective action. **[The most dangerous escalation]{.underline}**
sub-[**scenario** of 'Drang nach Westen' **involves a continuous,
step-by-step Russian advance from**]{.underline} (either limited or
extended) [**intervention in Ukraine to directly threatening NATO member
states in the Baltics** on the pretext of protecting 'Russian'
populations abroad]{.underline}. The risk of this scenario is primarily
that **[NATO and Russia could climb the escalation ladder far beyond the
levels seen during the Cold War and up to the point of the
'unthinkable']{.underline}**. To avoid this, Moscow would attempt to put
to best use its information warfare instruments to create an environment
of ambiguity and uncertainty in pursuing its (neo-)imperial project. The
secondary risk is that [the US would choose not to act to prevent
escalation, the result of which would be the effective end of
NATO]{.underline} not only as a defence alliance, but gradually also as
a security community defined by dependable expectations of peaceful
change.41

#### Arms sales causes the Ukraine conflict to escalate to full-blown US-Russia war

**Carpenter 18** -- senior fellow in defense and foreign policy studies
at the Cato Institute and a contributing editor at TAC, is the author of
10 books, the contributing editor of 10 books, and the author of more
than 700 articles on international affairs. (Ted Galen, "Washington
Quietly Increases Lethal Weapons to Ukraine," CATO Institute,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/washington-quietly-increases-lethal-weapons-ukraine)//BB>

On September 1, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker disclosed
during an interview with The Guardian that Washington's future military
aid to Kiev would likely involve weapons sales to Ukraine's air force
and navy as well as the army. "The Javelins are mainly symbolic and it's
not clear if they would ever be used," Aric Toler, a research scholar at
the Atlantic Council, asserted. One could well dispute his sanguine
conclusion, but even Toler conceded: "[Support for]{.underline} the
[Ukrainian]{.underline} navy and air [defence]{.underline} would be a
big deal. That would be far more significant." Volker's cavalier
attitude about U.S. arms sales to a government locked in a crisis with
Russia [epitomizes the arrogance and tone-deaf nature of the views that
too many U.S. foreign policy officials exhibit regarding the sensitive
Ukraine issue]{.underline}. "We can have a conversation with Ukraine
like we would with any other country about what do they need. I think
that there's going to be some discussion about naval capability because
as you know their navy was basically taken by Russia \[when the Soviet
Union dissolved\]. And so they need to rebuild a navy and they have very
limited air capability as well. I think we'll have to look at air
defence." One suspects that [Americans would be incensed at comparable
actions by Moscow if the geo-strategic situations were reversed. Imagine
if Russia]{.underline} (even a democratic Russia) [had emerged from the
wreckage of the Cold War as the undisputed global superpower, and a
weakened United States had to watch as the Kremlin expanded a powerful,
Russian-led military alliance to America's borders, conducted alliance
war games within sight of U.S. territory, interfered in Canada's
internal political affairs]{.underline} to oust a democratically elected
pro-American government, [and then pursued growing military ties with
the new, anti-U.S. government in Ottawa.]{.underline} [Yet that would be
disturbingly similar to what Washington has done regarding]{.underline}
NATO policy and U.S. relations with [Ukraine]{.underline}. Moreover,
[although Kiev's cheerleaders in the Western (especially U.S.) media
like to portray Ukraine as a beleaguered democracy that plays the role
of David to Russia's evil Goliath, the reality is far
murkier]{.underline}. Putin's government overstates matters when it
alleges that Ukraine's 2014 Maidan revolution was a U.S.-orchestrated
coup that brought outright fascists to power in Kiev. Nevertheless, that
version contains more than a little truth. Prominent, powerful U.S.
figures, most notably the late Senator John McCain and Assistant
Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland,
openly sided with demonstrators seeking to unseat Ukraine's elected
government. Indeed, Nuland was caught on tape with U.S. Ambassador to
Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt scheming about the desired composition of a new
government in Kiev. It is unfair to portray Ukraine's current
administration led by President Petro Poroshenko as a neo-fascist
regime. Post-revolution elections appear to have been reasonably free
and fair, and there are major factions that are committed to genuine
democratic values. But Ukraine also is hardly a model of Western-style
democracy. Not only is it afflicted with extensive graft and corruption,
but some extreme nationalist and even neo-Nazi groups play a significant
role in the "new" Ukraine. The notoriously fascist Azov Battalion, for
example, continues to occupy a prominent position in Kiev's efforts to
defeat separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region. Alexander
Zakharchenko, prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's
Republic in the pro-Russia rebel-occupied city of Donetsk, was
assassinated on September 1 and officials there and in Russia are
blaming Kiev. The Ukrainian government has denied involvement. Other
ultranationalist factions act as domestic militias that attempt to
intimidate more moderate Ukrainians. Even the Poroshenko government
itself has adopted troubling censorship measures and other autocratic
policies. [Officials in]{.underline} both [the]{.underline} Obama and
Trump [administration have taken a much too casual attitude toward U.S.
cooperation with extremist elements and a deeply flawed Ukrainian
government]{.underline}. [Both the danger of stoking tensions with
Moscow and becoming too close to a regime in Kiev that exhibits
disturbing features should caution the Trump administration against
boosting military aid to Ukraine]{.underline}. [It is an unwise policy
on strategic as well as moral grounds.]{.underline} Trump administration
officials should refuse to be intimidated or stampeded into forging a
risky and unsavory alliance with Kiev out of fear of being portrayed as
excessively "soft" toward Russia. Instead, [the president and his
advisers need to spurn efforts to increase U.S. support for
Ukraine.]{.underline} [A good place to start would be to restore
the]{.underline} Obama administration's [refusal to approve arms sales
to Kiev]{.underline}. [Washington must not pour gasoline on a
geo-strategic fire that could lead to a **full-blown crisis between the
United States and Russia**]{.underline}.

### L -- escalating violence

#### US arms sales cause escalating violence in Ukraine

**Davis 18** -- senior fellow for Defense Priorities and a former
lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army who retired in 2015 after twenty-one
years, including four combat deployments (Daniel, "What Does America
Gain by Arming Ukraine?," *National Interest*,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/what-does-america-gain-by-arming-ukraine-24901)//BB>

[Not only will the sale of lethal arms not materially help Ukraine, but
also it will likely increase Russian and separatist opposition,
worsening the situation. A change in the methodology of how the
government engages internationally is needed]{.underline}. Whether in
Ukraine or another international engagement, [if an honest analysis
reveals that the United States has merely a secondary]{.underline} or
tertiary [interest]{.underline}---rather than a core national
interest---[yet commits itself to expending valuable political or
military capital, the **chances are high** that such engagement would
end up costing more than would be gained]{.underline}. Why should
Washington spend money and risk the lives of our troops for a mission
that would leave the country at a net loss? [In the current standoff in
the Ukraine, Washington would certainly prefer to see a peaceful
resolution]{.underline} to the violence. [For Moscow and Kiev, however,
the matter is existential, meaning each is willing to expend
considerable capital and take significant risks to resolve the conflict
in their favor]{.underline}. The 210 [anti-tank missiles]{.underline}
the State Department authorized is enough to equip four or five
mechanized or infantry battalions for a short period of time. These
missiles could provide a momentary tactical advantage, but
strategically, the quantity [is insufficient to tilt the balance of
power with Russia and its allied forces]{.underline}. In the latter
stages of the Cold War, I was an officer in the 2nd Squadron, 2nd
Armored Cavalry Regiment (2-2 ACR), a heavily armored unit composed of
large numbers of tanks and armored infantry carriers. In 1991, 2-2 ACR
was sent to Iraq to fight Saddam Hussein's armored divisions, which had
invaded Kuwait. At the Battle of 73 Easting, my squadron (a
battalion-sized armored unit), fought against a brigade of an Iraqi
armored division. During that battle, three cavalry troops of 2nd
ACR---approximately the size of one mechanized battalion---fired 125
tank rounds and eighty anti-tank missiles. In the span of less than six
hours, one battalion-sized unit fired the equivalent of 38 percent of
the entire missile sale to Ukraine. Thus, [no matter how it is billed in
Washington, this sale will not "push back" against Russian
aggression]{.underline}, nor is it in the "interests of our nation."
[But while sending these missiles **isn't enough to tip the military
balance** in Ukraine, it is **more than enough to convince Russia to
increase its involvement**]{.underline}. Those missiles represent a
clear increase in the risk to Russia and their proxy forces within
eastern Ukraine because it signals that Washington may be willing to
provide even greater lethal support to their opponent. It is therefore
likely [Moscow will take stronger action to counter the threat to
discourage even greater American engagement]{.underline}. This support
could take the form of Putin sending more armor, anti-armor missiles of
his own, more unofficial Russian troops, greater intelligence support
for allied forces, or some other response that brings more violence and
destruction to the Donbas region---the people we're ostensibly trying to
help. It is reasonable and appropriate for the United States to promote
the good of others abroad and to champion our values as an exemplar, a
shining city on a hill. But we should only use, or threaten to use,
military power when American security, economic prosperity, or our way
of life are directly threatened. [Washington's intention]{.underline}
with the missile sale [may be to increase the pain felt by Putin to
drive him to a negotiated settlement, but the actual result will almost
certainly be a further militarization of the situation and an increase
in the **potential for an expansion of the conflict**]{.underline}. [Far
from improving American security, this sale will undermine it. Far from
protecting Ukrainians, sending these missiles will place them at
increasing risk]{.underline}.

#### Russia escalates and takes [all]{.underline} of Ukraine

**Carden 15** -- Contributing Editor for The National Interest (James,
"Here\'s Why Arming Ukraine Would Be a Disaster," National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/heres-why-arming-ukraine-would-be-disaster-12213)//BB>

The joint report by the Brookings Institution, the Atlantic Council and
the Chicago Council on Global Affairs calling for the United States to
arm Ukraine to the tune of \$3 billion a year through 2017 provoked a
surprisingly strong (and much needed) backlash from several important
policy hands in Washington. Within forty-eight hours of the report's
release, well-respected Russia experts from Brookings, the Carnegie
Endowment, Kissinger Associates and the Kennan Institute voiced their
well-founded objections to the report's recommendations. Not that we
should expect Capitol Hill to take much notice. Already, Senator John
McCain and a bipartisan group of over forty House and Senate legislators
have called upon the Obama administration to send military aid to Kiev.
At a press conference on Thursday, McCain scolded the Europeans for not
properly learning the lessons of Munich in 1938: "They\'ve been a huge
disappointment to me. Their actions recently have been reminiscent of
the 1930s." For the neocons, it's never not 1938. This was followed by
McCain's egregious---though given his past behavior, not terribly
surprising---acting out in Munich on Saturday, where he dismissed German
chancellor Angela Merkel's calls for a diplomatic approach to the
standoff as mere "foolishness." [That the United States]{.underline} and
NATO [have the capability to "level the playing field" by arming Kiev
with radars and anti-tank missiles is a commonly held idea]{.underline}
among supporters of McCain's preferred policy option. [The argument goes
something like this: every time Kiev's forces have been on the verge of
victory over the separatist forces, Russia has stepped in, escalated and
turned the tide in favor of the rebels.]{.underline} We see this
happening right now in the battle taking place in and around the
Debaltseve junction in eastern Ukraine. We may well see something
similar occur in and around Mariupol. If the West, so the argument goes,
would just provide Kiev with the armaments it needs, then Kiev would
have a better chance at securing a victory over the rebels. After all,
if the Russians can supply their clients, [why can't we supply
ours?]{.underline} Besides the fact that such a program of proxy-supply
rarely works, and when it has, has usually come back to haunt us (see
under: bin Laden, Osama), [the idea that Kiev would emerge victorious if
only we act as its principal arms supplier is **fallacious** simply
because there is nothing that we could provide them with that Russia, in
turn, couldn\'t and more to the point, wouldn't, supply the
rebels]{.underline}. [It would simply mean a net increase in armaments
on both sides, which would almost certainly result in more and more
civilian deaths]{.underline}. The simple fact of the matter is that
[Russia is so situated geographically that it has an overwhelming
advantage over NATO in the region]{.underline}. Further, even if the
president went along with the McCain plan, and the United States did
supply military aid to Kiev, are we so sure that their troops are
equipped with the proper training to use these weapons? Doubtful. And if
the United States then has to send in military advisers to train the
Ukrainian troops, what happens if one of them gets killed by Russian
forces? Is McCain willing to risk a shooting war---or possibly a nuclear
war---with Russia over the fate of the Donbas? It would seem so. Another
objection to arming Kiev is the nature of the regime to which we are
propping up. The government in [Ukraine]{.underline} is still wondrously
corrupt. It is led by an oligarch who many conveniently forget was
closely tied to ancien regime, having served as minister of trade in
2012 and as minister of foreign affairs in 2009-2010. Its [armed forces
are an admixture of volunteer battalions and regular forces that are not
under a unified command]{.underline}. What is more, Kiev is struggling
with recruitment efforts. According to the Ukrainian daily
Korrespondent, only 6 percent of those showing up this year for the call
to military service have done so voluntarily. Does McCain propose to
send arms to an army that has no recruits with which to use them? Are we
so sure that the weapons McCain would like to provide Kiev wouldn't end
up in the wrong hands, as they have so many times before, in Iraq, in
Syria, in Libya and in Afghanistan? [If the idea that the United States
can help "level the playing field" by funneling billions of dollars
worth of equipment that Ukrainian forces don\'t know how to operate is a
fantasy, the idea that those same weapons would serve to deter Mr. Putin
is no less so]{.underline}. [The **more likely scenario is that Putin
will**]{.underline} do what he did back in 2008. In April of that year,
NATO's Bucharest Memorandum flatly and unambiguously stated that Georgia
and Ukraine "will become members of NATO." By August, Russian tanks were
idling 40km outside of Tbilisi. In September, Mr. Putin reportedly told
the EU's Jose Manuel Barroso: "if I want to, I can **[take Kiev in two
weeks]{.underline}**." It could still happen.

### L -- entanglement

#### Ukraine will use US entanglement to [intentionally escalate]{.underline} \-\-- they perceive US arms are a signal of [future battlefield support]{.underline}

**DePetris 16** -- MA in Political Science @ Syracuse, fellow at Defense
Priorities (Daniel, "SENDING U.S. ARMS TO UKRAINE IS A BAD IDEA,"
Defense Priorities,
<http://www.defensepriorities.org/opinion/sending-us-arms-to-ukraine-is-a-bad-idea)//BB>

Being shrewd and setting priorities can determine whether the [national
security policies]{.underline} of the U.S. actually meet the nation's
interests or [entrap us in disputes that can lead to geostrategic
instability]{.underline}. The first several months of a new
administration, when the president orders policy reviews, modifications
in existing programs, or a clean break from the past, is inevitably seen
as an opening for officials, politicians, and policy advocates in
Washington who hope to influence the White House over the next four
terms. [For the Senate Ukraine Caucus]{.underline} --- a bipartisan
group of senior [lawmakers who have lobbied intensively for]{.underline}
a closer U.S.-Ukraine relationship --- increasing political, economic,
and [military support to the Ukrainian government]{.underline} is one of
those priorities that the incoming Trump administration should move up
on its list. In a letter to President-Elect Trump, [they write that it
is absolutely critical for the United States to enhance its support to
Kiev]{.underline} at a time when Vladimir Putin's Russia continues to
support a separatist movement on Ukrainian soil. "Quite simply," the
group writes, "Russia has launched a military land-grab in Ukraine that
is unprecedented in modern European history. These actions in Crimea and
other areas of eastern Ukraine dangerously upend well-established
diplomatic, legal, and security norms that the United States and its
NATO allies painstakingly built over decades." On this score, [the
senators are correct. Russia's stealth invasion, occupation, and
annexation of the Crimean Peninsula was for all intents and purposes a
land-grab]{.underline} denounced not only by the United States but by
the United Nations as the definition of a violation of state sovereignty
and self-determination. [But lets not kid ourselves; this isn't the
first time a stronger power will attempt to change the borders of a
weaker neighbor, nor will it be the last. The Russians saw an
opportunity to]{.underline} immediately [exploit]{.underline} the
confusion of the post-Viktor Yanukovychto its advantage. Moscow's
signing of the Minsk accords, an agreement that was designed to
de-escalate the violence in Eastern Ukraine through mutual
demobilization of heavy weapons along the conflict line and a transfer
of border control from separatist forces back to the Ukrainian
government, has been stalled to the point of irrelevance. It is
incontrovertible that, were it not for Russia's military support and
intervention in the summer of 2014, the Ukrainian army would likely have
been able to defeat separatist units that were carving out autonomous
"peoples' republics" in the east --- or at the very least, degrade rebel
capabilities to such an extent that Kiev would be able to string more
concessions at the negotiating table. Yet as we should appropriately
acknowledge Russia's violations of international law and the U.N.
Charter, [U.S. policymakers]{.underline} and their European counterparts
also [need to recognize Ukraine is far more important for Moscow's
geopolitical position than Washington's]{.underline}. [There is a reason
why Vladimir Putin made the fateful decision in 2014 to plunge Russian
forces into Ukraine]{.underline}, [and it wasn't because he was itching
for a war of preemption. He deployed Russian forces across the Ukrainian
border]{.underline}, despite the whirlwind of international condemnation
and the western financial sanctions that were likely to accompany such a
decision, [because preserving a pro-Russia bent in the Ukraine body
politic was just too important for Moscow's regional
position]{.underline}. [Grasping this reality in no way excuses Moscow's
behavior. It merely explains why the Russian government acted the way it
did, and why further U.S. military assistance to the Ukrainian security
forces would]{.underline} just as likely [motivate Moscow to be more
unhelpful]{.underline} in the country as it would to wind down their
involvement. In fact, one could make a convincing case that [providing
hundreds of millions]{.underline} of dollars in security assistance [to
the Ukrainian government doesn't help the situation at all, instead
leading Kiev to **delude itself into thinking that Washington will come
to their immediate military aid** in order to stabilize the
battlefield]{.underline}. Since 2015, the United States Congress has
authorized \$750 million in order to improve the defensive capabilities
of the Ukrainian military and security forces, including through the
provision of lethal defensive weapons in order to make Russia's
aggression in Ukraine more painful and unpopular within the Russian
public. The Congress has followed up those funds with an additional
\$650 million ear-marked for the Ukrainians over the next two years, a
hefty sum that the next administration would probably use as a message
to the Russians that further territorial encroachment on Ukrainian
territory would produce more casualties in their ranks. What the next
administration needs to ask itself, however, is whether more money
thrown at the Ukraine problem will be more or less likely to cause
further violence in the country and turmoil for Ukraine's elected
government. [Russia has demonstrated consistently that it will simply
not permit a pro-western democratic government from emerging along its
western border]{.underline} --- and that if a pro-western government is
formed in Kiev, [Moscow will do its best to preserve a pro-Russian bent
in Ukraine's eastern provinces]{.underline}. [Hundreds of millions of
dollars in appropriations haven't forced Russia to change that
calculation so]{.underline} far; [it's downright unconscionable to think
that]{.underline} hundreds of [millions more will be any more
successful]{.underline}. [Indeed, every time Washington has escalated
its rhetoric or authorized money for Ukraine's military, the Russians
have responded in equal terms]{.underline}. The political crisis in
Ukraine is far from resolved, in large measure of which is due to
Russia's own actions on the ground and its non-existent implementation
of the Minsk peace agreement. But the situation in the east, while not
fully peaceful by any means, is far less violent than at the war's peak
in 2015. [Sometimes, not weighing in can be just as smart for the U.S.
national interest as getting involved]{.underline} --- [a reflex that is
has been the forte of Washington's foreign policy establishment since
the end of the Cold War]{.underline}.

#### Cause Russian escalation and US entanglement

**Thrall 18** -- PhD in Political Science @ MIT (Trevor, "Ukraine,
Trump, and Javelin Missiles," CATO,
<https://www.cato.org/blog/ukraine-trump-javelin-missiles)//BB>

To be sure, Ukraine already had plenty of motivation to help the Trump
administration. If Ukraine shuttered the investigations to curry Trump's
favor, it was only one of several efforts designed to garner American
support. Concerned that Trump's affection for Vladimir Putin would
translate into anti-Ukraine policies, [Ukraine has gone out of its way
to butter up Trump since he took office]{.underline}. Ukraine has
promised U.S. construction firms contracts for future infrastructure
projects in Donbass, brokered a \$80 million coal deal with the U.S.,
signed a \$1 billion deal with GE Transportation for new locomotives,
and hired former Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour to
help Ukraine lobby the Trump administration. [But]{.underline} even if
this has nothing to do with the Mueller investigation, [the sale of
Javelin missiles to Ukraine reflects both poor judgment]{.underline} on
the part of the Trump administration [and a longstanding neglect of the
potential negative consequences of American arms sales]{.underline}.
[Arming Ukraine makes little strategic sense]{.underline}. [A couple
hundred antitank missiles will not alter the military balance between
Ukraine and Russia in Donbas in any meaningful way]{.underline}. [Russia
can quickly move additional forces and equipment to the region at will.
The]{.underline} bigger [danger is that arming Ukraine will in fact
prompt Russia to do just that, thereby risking an intensification of the
conflict and potentially leading to more casualties]{.underline} than
the 10,000 already suffered. [It is clear, in fact, that this is exactly
how Russia sees things]{.underline}. In December after [the State
Department]{.underline} approved the sale, Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, "The United States [is]{.underline},
in fact, [encouraging the resumption of large-scale bloodshed in
Donbass]{.underline}, [where the situation is already on the edge due to
continuing shelling from the Kiev-controlled
side]{.underline}...[Washington, in fact, becomes an accomplice in the
killing of people.]{.underline}" [Arming Ukraine]{.underline} also
[raises the political stakes and risks turning Ukraine into a test of
the president's foreign policy effectiveness]{.underline}, [**increasing
the likelihood of the United States getting entangled** more deeply in
the conflict]{.underline}. It seems clear that [encouraging greater U.S.
involvement is a key element of Ukraine's strategy]{.underline}. Major
General Volodymyr Havrylov, Ukraine's defense attaché to the U.S., told
a reporter that the missiles were "a political symbol that allows others
to understand that Ukrainian security is important to the U.S." [The
risk of entanglement is **not trivial** given the presence of **powerful
advocates for doing more in the U.S. Congress**]{.underline}. Senator
Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved
of the sale back in December, telling the press that "This decision was
supported by Congress in legislation that became law three years ago and
reflects our country's longstanding commitment to Ukraine in the face of
ongoing Russian aggression."

### L -- diplomacy

#### No diplomacy can work while future arms are on the table

**Ellison 18** -- MA candidate @ UNC-Chapel Hill, contributor @ The
Foreign Analyst, intern @ NATO Allied Command Transformation (Davis,
"Alternatives, not Arms, are Needed for Ukraine. [By selling weapons to
Ukraine, the United States is risking increased conflict while ignoring
diplomatic alternatives]{.underline}.," The Foreign Analyst,
http://theforeignanalyst.com/alternatives-not-arms-are-needed-for-ukraine/)//BB

[Support for arming Ukraine with lethal weaponry]{.underline} has come
from American national security experts on both sides of the political
spectrum. Unfortunately, their confidence in this strategy [is based on
a misread of both the situation in Ukraine and of the strategic
realities of US-Russian relations. The time has come for a new
diplomatic settlement.]{.underline} In December of last year, the US
administration approved [the sale of lethal arms to
Ukraine]{.underline}. This [could lead to a serious escalation of
violence]{.underline}, particularly as both the Ukrainian military and
the eastern oblast rebels continue to violate the terms of the Minsk II
ceasefire signed in 2015[. Within a "new cold war" era between Russia
and the West, we tend to forget that the Ukraine conflict is rather a
civil war involving external intervention, than a proxy war between
great powers]{.underline}. This decision is clearly based on [a flawed
concept of "escalate to de-escalate]{.underline}" that likely originated
in a Defense Department increasingly spearheading US foreign policy.
Such a theoretical basis for policy [is weak]{.underline} at best,
especially as [it ignores the fundamental facts of the
conflict]{.underline}. [It underestimates the involvement of the
separatists themselves in the conflict, conflating the war into a full
scale territorial clash between Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}. While
Russia's direct involvement is undeniable, [the conflict has hardly
escalated to general war]{.underline}. Who then, is the United States
planning to fight against? A separatist movement with a dearth of
grassroots support in their own territory? As Robert Work stated in a
2015 Congressional testimony: "[escalation is escalation" and sending
arms would thus necessitate an escalatory response]{.underline}.
Alternative [diplomatic solutions have been lacking]{.underline} as the
debate over a Ukrainian solution has raged. [Previous experiences in
conflict resolution have been largely ignored by analysts, with US
policy therefore following a zero-sum path that is]{.underline} slowly
[eroding possibilities for a negotiated settlement]{.underline}. There
are two historical examples that can inform policymakers to prudently
approach Ukraine without resorting to arms shipments: Cyprus and Bosnia.
Incentivizing Moscow to attack or escalate [Increased arms sales will
likely cause a greater incentive for both side to violate the Minsk II
agreement and rather pursue an escalatory course that will only deepen
the conflict, further entrench the adversaries and increase
casualties]{.underline}. [There is no reason to believe such a move
would provide a deterrent]{.underline} either, [with the military
reality on the ground belying any attempt to persuade
otherwise]{.underline}. A combination between Russian military
prevalence and the complicated nature of US policy in the former Soviet
Union has led to a climate where actions are limited. This offer of arms
is particularly dangerous due to NATO's 2008 pledge to eventually
consider a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine. By extending this offer a
decade ago, without any security guarantees, NATO left Ukraine
vulnerable to Russia giving Moscow an incentive to prevent this future
membership. Offering weapons while also continuing to deny any form of
security guarantee is only inviting more danger by increasing the
likeliness of a Russian military intervention. Additionally, the
often-cited 1994 Budapest Memorandum between Ukraine, Russia, the US,
and the UK (also Belarus and Kazakhstan) does not obligate the United
States to militarily defend Ukraine against a conventional threat
without UN Security Council authorization. While acting without UNSC
authorization is certainly possible, it would be diplomatically
dangerous. [Moscow has to respond to these promised weapons sales, and
its options place both Ukraine and the West in an untenable
position]{.underline}. First, [it could push for the separatist eastern
regions to become unified with Russia itself, leading to yet another
forceful border change in violation of all international legal
norms]{.underline}. Second, [Russia could shut off Ukraine's
power]{.underline} once again, while also blocking the importation of
energy by force. [Another option would be to increase provocations
against eastern NATO members, namely the Baltic states,
through]{.underline} actions other than armed conflict such as
[cyberattacks and kidnappings]{.underline}. These are only a few out of
host options Moscow is likely to consider, with other more pernicious
options being also possible. Daniel DePetris of Reuters has noted that
"[there's no reason to think Putin would respond less violently now if
Washington sent defense shipments to Ukraine]{.underline}," in reference
to a Russian armored offensive against Debaltseve in late 2014. As noted
by several authors, including Rajan Menon and Fiona Hill, Russia holds
"escalation dominance" in the region, though it has never been fully
explained nor has its strategic implications been clarified. First and
foremost, escalation dominance means that in almost any conceivable
conventional conflict in Eastern Ukraine, Russia will be victorious.
Ukraine sits in between both the Western and Southern Military
districts, with the entirety of the Russian command-and-control and
logistics network within short distances. Furthermore, Russian troops
have also begun building permanent bases along the border with Ukraine,
including highly mobile and combat experienced units that can quickly
bring reinforcement. Simply put, [there is no amount of weapons
importation by Ukraine that can offset Russian conventional superiority
in the near- to medium-term]{.underline}. Equally important to the
military dynamic, Russian dominance in the region forces any Western
diplomats to negotiate from a position of weakness, an uncomfortable
position for the United States. [The primary consequence here is that
the United States is hardly in a position to dictate any terms on a
settlement, and will require Moscow and Western allies' cooperation in
order to reach any meaningful progress]{.underline}. Sanctions can
certainly be seen as a useful coercive measure, but due to rises in
commodity prices, the Russian economy has seen a moderate improvement
recently despite its isolation. Therefore, **[a solution will have to be
found that makes concessions to Moscow]{.underline}**. The simple
logistical and military dominance that the Russian military holds in the
region makes [any pressure extremely unlikely to work]{.underline}. [By
providing weapons to Ukraine, the United States is]{.underline}
effectively [giving up on a negotiated settlement to the
conflict]{.underline}. [While the Minsk II agreement has been repeatedly
violated, this is no solid reasoning for its abandonment. By abandoning
the agreement and giving preference to]{.underline} a settlement via
[arms]{.underline}, [the United States is only further
internationalizing a civil war and ignoring the root
causes]{.underline}. Importantly, the civil war in Ukraine is between
irredentist Russian speakers in the eastern oblasts of Donetsk and
Luhansk and the central government, originating in differing views on
regional autonomy. The Russian government militarized these tensions
using the momentum of the Crimea annexation to turn a constitutional
dispute into an armed conflict. Diplomatic alternatives [Previous
conflicts in Europe that have included an ethnic dimension as well as
external influence should be used as a guide for policy options in
Ukraine]{.underline}. The first example is that of Cyprus, which bears
in some way a striking resemblance to the overall Ukrainian situation.
The island is divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, with only
Turkey recognizing the northern half of the island as an independent
territory. Spurred by ethnic conflict on the island, the ultimate
solution was found with the deployment of a United Nations Peacekeeping
Force, largely made up of troops from neutral states. The island has
remained divided since 1974, though the conflict has largely been
dormant since then. What is significant is that all states have been
able to continue fairly normalized relations with the Republic of Cyprus
(the southern, Greek speaking section of Cyprus) despite the ongoing
dispute, granting the country European Union membership in 2004. The
lesson to be taken from Cyprus is that a peacekeeping settlement, even
without a full resolution to the underlying territorial dispute, can be
effective. [Since fall 2017, calls for such a peacekeeping force in
Eastern Ukraine have been growing, with fairly widespread support,
including from Moscow]{.underline}. [To discard this avenue in favor of
arms support would be a mistake]{.underline}. As noted above, [even if
the two policies were taken at the same time, such arms supply to
Ukraine would only weaken any peacekeeping force while also failing to
strengthen the position of the US as a negotiator]{.underline}.
Importantly, the deployment of peacekeepers would have to involve
concessions made to Moscow, through the lifting of sanctions and/or the
de facto acceptance of the breakaway regions' autonomy. A second model
for a longer-term diplomatic approach is a federalization policy that
bears a resemblance to the Republika Srpska within Bosnia. The
federalization of Ukraine has been suggested by Russia for some time,
and it is perhaps time to consider the option seriously. Limited
devolution would address the desires of the separatists themselves while
meeting Russian requests. Such devolution could come with safeguards,
such as disarmament within both Donetsk and Luhansk, with Russia
providing security guarantees to both regions. In Bosnia, it has allowed
ethnic grievances between groups in Bosnia to be handled in a largely
non-violent fashion. The establishment of the Republika Srpska was a
hard pill for Western states to swallow, however it became necessary for
the higher goal of reaching a peaceful settlement. [A key lesson for the
United States in Bosnia was that the prevention of further bloodshed was
more important than the preservation of Yugoslavian
sovereignty]{.underline}. [Were the US]{.underline} and its allies [to
take this lesson to heart and eschew a hard line on Ukrainian
sovereignty with the goal of ending the conflict, it could begin a slow
path towards improving Western relations with Russia]{.underline}.
Finally, any solution will require neutrality for Ukraine. This would
mean removing the offer of NATO membership to Ukraine (which arguably
placed Ukraine in Moscow's crosshairs in the first place), and
maintaining an economic balance between the European Union and Moscow,
while also pushing against formal EU membership. This option has been
suggested by Michael O'Hanlon in his new book Beyond NATO, that argues
in favor of such proposal for currently unaligned states between Europe
and Russia. Removing the NATO offer would be immensely beneficial
towards building better future relations with Moscow and ending the
Ukrainian conflict. The current predicament the West finds itself in can
almost be considered comeuppance for the misguided NATO offer without
any security guarantee. Certainly, these solutions would not be
preferential for Western policymakers, but that is the nature of
compromise. They would effectively reverse decades of US and NATO
defense and diplomatic policy. However, current and recent policies have
hardly been adequate. There is no possibility of a diplomatic solution
that accords full territorial return of Crimea to Ukraine, nor can there
be any peacekeeping force dominated primarily by NATO. A further
drawback would be the abandonment of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum,
though the treaty itself was without the teeth for its own enforcement.
Any settlement regarding peacekeepers and/or devolution would provide
the opportunity to install stronger safeguards for all parties. [The
current US policy of arms **supplying rules out any**]{.underline}
possibilities of [**constructive diplomatic efforts** to resolve the
security situation in Ukraine]{.underline}. Both options (along with
O'Hanlon's suggestions of permanent Ukrainian neutrality), do not fully
preclude the establishment of harsher measures should Russia continue to
make aggressive moves despite these agreements. Harsher economic
sanctions against the Kremlin's inner circle or even extension of a NATO
security guarantee despite an ongoing territorial dispute should be kept
on the table in case Moscow decides to further endanger Ukraine.
However, it is critical that policy be shaped by the realities of the
situation in Ukraine, rather than preferred outcomes. Diplomacy should
be pursued first, using past instances of conflict resolution as a
model.

President Trump's decision to increase U.S. military engagement in
Ukraine's conflict comes at a curious time, just three months after
Putin broached the prospect of an international peacekeeping mission for
the very first time and two days after Moscow, Kiev, and the separatists
reaffirmed their intention to call a holiday ceasefire and proceed
toward an "all-for-all" prisoner exchange. [While dozens of ceasefires
have come and gone in Ukraine and a Russian-drafted peacekeeping
proposal was far below the threshold of what would be required to
actually implement an impartial peace in the Donbas, Putin's willingness
to at least consider it left a slim opening for European diplomats and
U.S. Special Representative Kurt Volker to explore options with their
Russian counterparts]{.underline}. [Washington's move to provide U.S.
lethal weapons stockpiles to the Ukrainians could have an **adverse
impact on all of these diplomatic processes**]{.underline}. [By throwing
the United States deeper into the Ukrainian morass]{.underline},
President [Trump has taken the first giant step toward further American
involvement in the likely event that Moscow escalates and the Ukrainian
government asks for more weapons. This is a frightening
possibility]{.underline}, particularly for Americans who would prefer
not to intervene on behalf of a nation that is not even a member of NATO

[The Ukraine/Russia conflict is particularly ominous because tensions
with the United States could escalate into a **nuclear
war**]{.underline}. For this reason, it is necessary to understand
NATO's role, patterns of U.S. domination and the nuclear arms race. [The
political world is dangerously in flux, with entangled military and
economic alliances and a robust weapons trade]{.underline}. [This is
similar to the prelude to World War I when it took **one trigger** to
unleash cascading inter-state violence]{.underline}. The demonization of
Russia and Putin leaves out the role of the United States and NATO.
Seumas Milne, writes in The Guardian, March 4, 2015, "A quarter of a
century after the end of the Cold War, the 'Russian threat' is
unmistakably back. Vladimir Putin, Britain's defence secretary Michael
Fallon declares, is as great a danger to Europe as 'Islamic State'...
"Putin's authoritarian conservatism may offer little for Russia's
future, but this anti-Russian incitement is dangerous folly. There
certainly has been military expansionism. But it has overwhelmingly come
from NATO, not Moscow." James Bissett is a former Canadian ambassador to
Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria. He wrote in the Ottawa Citizen last
year, "[The]{.underline} current [crisis in Ukraine]{.underline}
threatens global security and at worst [has the potential for nuclear
catastrophe.]{.underline} At best, it signals a continuation of the Cold
War. Sadly, the crisis is completely unnecessary and the responsibility
lies entirely in the hands of the United States-led NATO powers. The
almost virulent propaganda onslaught blaming Russia for the instability
and violence in Ukraine simply ignores reality and the facts." Stephen
Cohen, emeritus professor of Russian studies at Princeton University and
New York University says that simply blaming Vladimir Putin and Russia
for [the]{.underline} present [stand-off in relations means "no
negotiation" and]{.underline} that [no negotiation leads to
war]{.underline}. He told Democracy Now last year, "The false statement
\[Obama\] made, and the premise on which American policy is being made,
is that Putin attacked Ukraine and began this whole mess. Whatever you
think about what the outcome should be, that is just factually untrue.
All of this began when the United States and Europe asked Ukraine back
last November to make a decision between Russia and the European Union."

while parliament fiddles, Europe burns, or at least sputters into flame.
History could not be clearer. [The diversion of the Russo-Ukrainian
conflict into the Sea of Azov is precisely the kind of escalation that
has preceded Europe's past cataclysms. A great power treats a little one
with contempt. A little one responds with violence, expecting friends to
come to its aid, diplomatically, economically, then
militarily.]{.underline} For four years, [Ukraine has disobeyed the old
pragmatism that if you share a border with a powerful dictator, you
behave with extreme caution. Kiev's anti-communists flirted with Nato --
with the US's encouragement -- at a time when Georgia was also flirting
and the Baltic states had already joined. Vladimir Putin echoed Yeltsin,
that Russia would "take this as a direct threat to the security of our
country".]{.underline} When Ukraine elected a pro-western leadership in
2014, Moscow supported an uprising in its Russian-speaking eastern
provinces. [There followed Moscow's invasion of Ukrainian Crimea, and
now a tightening of the noose on Ukraine's eastern ports. Ten thousand
Ukrainians have already died in this secret war. **It is classic
escalation.**]{.underline} Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, is
accused of hanging tough as he faces defeat in forthcoming elections. On
Sunday he appealed to "Ukraine's allies to stand united" against Russia.
He did not specify who they were, or what they should do. [After the
invasion of Crimea, a ragbag of trade, financial and travel sanctions
were imposed on Moscow by western powers. As usual, such feel-good
weapons had no effect beyond counter-productivity. Sanctions cemented
Putin more closely in power and to his cronies.]{.underline} They
encouraged him to ever greater mischief, backing Russian minorities in
bordering states and cyber-meddling in western elections. [The thesis
that impoverishment would somehow force him to cease from, as he sees
it, restoring Russia's pride was absurd. Dictatorship loves poverty.
Sanctions merely fuelled Donald Trump's casual remark last year that
Nato was "obsolete". What is glaring is that Europe now lacks any
collective forum in which such escalations can be discussed and possibly
resolved. The end of the cold war was not followed by any revision to
Yalta or Potsdam. There was no new treaty with Russia. Its attempted
military encirclement by Nato was as reckless as London's welcome to
Moscow's massed oligarch and kleptocrats.]{.underline} History may yet
regard the handling of a defeated and depressed Russia in the 1990s as
like its handling of Germany after 1918. [Eastern Europe is now a
tinderbox of competing populisms, full of talk of Putin only
understanding violence, of dodgy alliances and half-meant security
promises. There is no leader, no overseer, no plausible guarantor of
peace. **The only promise is of anarchy.**]{.underline} And do you know
what Britain's parliament was discussing all this time ... ?

[The US Government is trying to bully Russia]{.underline} and its
allies, and now is overtly threatening to go to a naval blockade against
Russia. Those two warships that the US just donated to Ukraine could be
helpful in such a blockade. Alternatively, [Ukraine's re-invasion of
Donbass might become Trump's opportunity to]{.underline} 'aid a NATO
ally' and [**precipitate WW III** from a conventional war in Donbass.
Either way would likely produce from Russia a nuclear blitz-attack to
eliminate as many of America's retaliatory weapons as possible, so as to
beat the US to the punch]{.underline}. [In military terms, the side that
suffers the less damage 'wins', even if it's a nuclear war that destroys
the planet]{.underline}. The side that would strike first in a nuclear
war would almost certainly suffer the less damage, because most of the
opponent's retaliatory weaponry would be destroyed in that attack.
[Trump is playing nuclear "chicken" against Putin. He is sorely trying
Putin's patience]{.underline}. If the US regime uses any of these
entry-points to a conventional war, [Russia would simply be waiting for
the US to nuclear blitz-attack Russia]{.underline}, which the US regime
has long been intending to do. [Regardless which side goes nuclear
first]{.underline}, the blockade and/or [re-invasion of
Donbass]{.underline} (repeating there such things as this and this)
**[will have started WWIII]{.underline}**. And, clearly, any survivors
would likely view the US in the way that most of today's world views the
fascist powers in WWII: as having been the aggressors. Consequently, if
the American people cannot first overthrow the US regime and establish
an authentic democracy here, then WWIII seems likely to result, which
would be an outcome far worse, for the entire world, than an overthrow
of the government that the entire world considers to be by far the most

If you take a walk around Washington or a Western European capital
today, there is no feeling of looming catastrophe. The threats are too
complex, with many moving pieces and overlapping layers of risk adding
up to a larger danger that is less obvious. People can be forgiven for
not seeing the cloud hanging over them, for feeling that all is well ---
even as [in Eastern Europe they are digging in for war]{.underline}. But
this [complacency is itself part of the problem, making the threat
**more difficult to foresee, to manage, or**]{.underline}, potentially,
to **[avert.]{.underline}** There is [a growing chorus of political
analysts, arms control experts, and government officials]{.underline}
who [are sounding the alarm]{.underline}, trying to call the world\'s
attention to its drift toward disaster. [The prospect of]{.underline} a
major war, even a **[nuclear war]{.underline}**, in Europe [has become
thinkable]{.underline}, they warn, [even **plausible**. What they
describe is a threat that combines]{.underline} many of the
[hair-trigger]{.underline} dangers [and **world-ending** stakes of the
Cold War with the]{.underline} volatility and [false calm that preceded
World War I]{.underline} --- a comparison I heard with disturbing
frequency. They described a number of ways that an unwanted but
nonetheless major war, like that of 1914, could break out in the Eastern
European borderlands. [The stakes]{.underline}, they say, [could not be
higher]{.underline}: the post--World War II peace in Europe, the lives
of thousands or millions of Eastern Europeans, or even, in a worst-case
scenario that is remote but real, [the **nuclear devastation of the
planet**]{.underline}. I. The warnings: \"**[War is not something
that\'s impossible anymore\"]{.underline}** Everyone in Moscow tells you
that if you want to understand Russia\'s foreign policy and its view of
its place the world, the person you need to talk to is Fyodor Lukyanov.
Sober and bespectacled, with an academic\'s short brown beard, Lukyanov
speaks with the precision of a political scientist but the occasional
guardedness of someone with far greater access than your average
analyst. Widely considered both an influential leader and an unofficial
interpreter of Russia\'s foreign policy establishment,
[Lukyanov]{.underline} is [chief of Russia\'s most important foreign
policy think tank]{.underline} and its most important foreign policy
journal, both of which reflect the state and its worldview. He is known
to be close to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. I met Lukyanov
around the corner from the looming Foreign Ministry compound (his office
is nearby), at a small, bohemian cafe in Moscow that serves French and
Israeli food to a room packed with gray suits. He was candid and
relaxed. When the discussion turned to the risks of war, he grew dire.
\"The atmosphere is a feeling that war is not something that's
impossible anymore,\" Lukyanov told me, describing a growing concern
within Moscow\'s foreign policy elite. \"A question that was absolutely
impossible a couple of years ago, whether there might be a war, a real
war, is back,\" he said. \"People ask it.\" I asked how this had
happened. He said that regular Russian people don\'t desire war, but
rather feared it would become necessary to defend against the implacably
hostile United States. \"The perception is that somebody would try to
undermine Russia as a country that opposes the United States, and then
we will need to defend ourselves by military means,\" he explained. Such
fears, vague but existential, are everywhere in Moscow. Even liberal
opposition leaders I met with, pro-Western types who oppose Putin,
expressed fears that the US posed an imminent threat to Russia\'s
security. I had booked my trip to Moscow in December, hoping to get the
Russian perspective on what were, at the time, murmurings among a
handful of political and arms control analysts that conflict could come
to Europe. By the time I arrived in the city, in late April, concerns of
an unintended and potentially catastrophic war had grown unsettlingly
common. [Lukyanov]{.underline}, pointing to the US and Russian military
buildups along Eastern Europe, also [worried that an accident or
provocation could be misconstrued as a deliberate attack and lead to
war]{.underline}. In the Cold War, he pointed out, both sides had
understood this risk and installed political and physical infrastructure
--- [think of the]{.underline} \"emergency [red phone\" --- to manage
tensions]{.underline} and prevent them from spiraling out of control.
**[That infrastructure is now gone]{.underline}**. [\"All those
mechanisms were disrupted or eroded]{.underline},\" he said. \"That
\[infrastructure\] has been degraded since the end of the Cold War
because the common perception is that we don't need it anymore.\" That
the world does not see the risk of war hanging over it, in other words,
makes that risk all the likelier. For most Americans, such predictions
sound improbable, even silly. But [the dangers are growing every week,
as are the warnings]{.underline}. \"One can hear eerie echoes of the
events a century ago that produced the catastrophe known as World War
I,\" Harvard professor and longtime Pentagon adviser Graham Allison ---
one of the graybeards of American foreign policy --- wrote in a May
cover story for the National Interest, co-authored with Russia analyst
Dimitri Simes. Their article, \"Russia and America: Stumbling to War,\"
warned that an unwanted, full-scale conflict between the US and Russia
was increasingly plausible. In Washington, the threat feels remote. It
does not in Eastern Europe. [Baltic nations, fearing war, have already
begun preparing for it]{.underline}. So has Sweden: \"[We see Russian
intelligence operations in Sweden]{.underline} --- [we]{.underline}
can\'t [interpret this]{.underline} in any other way --- [as preparation
for military operations]{.underline} against Sweden,\" a Swedish
security official announced in March. In May, Finland\'s defense
ministry sent letters to 900,000 citizens --- one-sixth of the
population --- telling them to prepare for conscription in case of a
\"crisis situation.\" Lithuania has reinstituted military conscription.
Poland, in June, appointed a general who would take over as military
commander in case of war. Though Western publics remain blissfully
unaware, and Western leaders divided, many of the people tasked with
securing Europe are treating conflict as more likely. In late April,
NATO and other Western officials gathered in [Estonia,]{.underline} a
former Soviet republic and NATO member on Russia\'s border that Western
analysts most worry [could become **ground zero for a major war** with
Russia.]{.underline} At the conference, Deputy Secretary General
Alexander Vershbow spoke so openly about NATO\'s efforts to prepare for
the possibility of Russia launching a limited nuclear strike in Europe
that, according to the journalist Ahmed Rashid, who was in attendance,
he had to be repeatedly reminded he was speaking on the record. One of
the scenarios Vershbow said NATO was outlining, according to Rashid\'s
paraphrase, was that [Russia could \"choose to use a tactical
weapon]{.underline} with a small blast range [on a European city or a
Western tank division]{.underline}.\" A few weeks later, the Guardian
reported that NATO is considering plans to \"upgrade\" its nuclear
posture in Europe in response to Russia\'s own nuclear saber-rattling.
One proposal: for NATO\'s military exercises to include more nuclear
weapons use, something Russia already does frequently. II. The gamble:
Putin\'s plan to make Russia great again [Should]{.underline} the
warnings prove right, and [a major war break out in Europe between
Russia and the West,]{.underline} then the story of that war, if anyone
is still around to tell it, [will begin with]{.underline} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin trying to solve a problem]{.underline}. That
problem is this: Putin\'s [Russia is weak. It can no longer stand toe to
toe with the US]{.underline}. It no longer has Europe divided in a
stalemate; rather, it sees the continent as dominated by an
ever-encroaching anti-Russian alliance[. In the Russian view, the
country\'s weakness leaves it]{.underline} at imminent risk,
[vulnerable]{.underline} to a hostile West bent on subjugating or
outright destroying Russia as it did to Iraq and Libya. [This is made
more urgent for Putin by his political problems at hom]{.underline}e. In
2012, during his reelection, popular [protests and accusations of fraud
weakened his]{.underline} sense of political [legitimacy]{.underline}.
[The problem worsened with Russia\'s 2014 economic
collapse]{.underline}; Putin\'s implicit bargain with the Russian people
had been that he would deliver economic growth and they would let him
erode basic rights. Without the economy, what did he have to offer them?
[Putin\'s answer has been to assert Russian power beyond its actual
strength]{.underline} --- and, in the process, to recast himself as a
national hero guarding against foreign enemies. Without a
world-power-class military or economy at his disposal, he is instead
wielding confusion and uncertainty --- which Soviet leaders rightly
avoided as existential dangers --- as weapons against the West. [Unable
to overtly control Eastern Europe, he has fomented risks and
crises]{.underline} in there, sponsoring separatists in Ukraine and
[conducting dangerous military activity along NATO airspace and coastal
borders,]{.underline} giving Russia more leverage there. [Reasserting a
Russian sphere of influence over Eastern Europe, he]{.underline}
apparently [believes, will]{.underline} finally [give Russia
security]{.underline} from the hostile West --- and make Russia a great
power once more. Knowing his military is outmatched against the
Americans, [he is blurring the distinction between war and
peace,]{.underline} deploying tactics that exist in, and thus widen, the
gray between: militia violence, propaganda, cyberattacks, under a new
rubric the Russian military sometimes calls \"hybrid war.\" Unable to
cross America\'s red lines, Putin is doing his best to muddy them ---
and, to deter the Americans, muddying his own. Turning otherwise routine
diplomatic and military incidents into games of high-stakes chicken
favors Russia, he believes, as the West will ultimately yield to his
superior will. To solve the problem of Russia\'s conventional military
weakness, [he has dramatically lowered the threshold for when he would
use nuclear weapons, hoping to terrify the West such that it
will]{.underline} bend to [avoid conflict]{.underline}. In public
speeches, over and over, he references those weapons and his willingness
to use them. [He has enshrined, in Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine,
a dangerous idea]{.underline} no Soviet leader ever adopted:
[that]{.underline} a [nuclear war could be winnable]{.underline}. Putin,
having recast himself at home as a national hero standing up to foreign
enemies, is more popular than ever. Russia has once more become a shadow
hanging over Eastern Europe, feared and only rarely bowed to, but always
taken seriously. Many Western Europeans, asked in a poll whether they
would defend their own Eastern European allies from a Russian invasion,
said no. Russia\'s aggression, born of both a desire to reengineer a
European order that it views as hostile and a sense of existential
weakness that justifies drastic measures, makes it far more willing to
accept the dangers of war. As RAND\'s F. Stephen Larrabee wrote in one
of the increasingly urgent warnings that some analysts are issuing,
\"The Russia that the United States faces today is more assertive and
more unpredictable --- and thus, in many ways, more dangerous --- than
the Russia that the United States confronted during the latter part of
the Cold War.\" Joseph Nye, the dean of Harvard University\'s school of
government and one of America\'s most respected international relations
scholars, pointed out that Russia\'s weakness-masking aggression was yet
another disturbing parallel to the buildup to World War I. \"[Russia
seems doomed to continue its decline]{.underline} --- an outcome that
should be no cause for celebration in the West,\" [Nye
wrote]{.underline} in a recent column. \"[States in decline]{.underline}
--- think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 --- tend to [become
**less risk-averse** and thus **much more dangerous**]{.underline}.\"
III. The drift: How the unthinkable became possible The Cold War was a
dangerous game, but it was a game in which everyone knew and agreed upon
the stakes and the rules. That is not the case today. The Western side
believes it is playing a game where the rules are clear enough, the
stakes relatively modest, and the competition easily winnable. The
Russian side, however, sees a game where the rules can be rewritten on
the fly, even the definition of war itself altered. For Russia, fearing
a threat from the West it sees as imminent and existential, the stakes
are unimaginably high, justifying virtually any action or gamble if it
could deter defeat and, perhaps, lead to victory. Separately, the
ever-paranoid Kremlin believes that the West is playing the same game in
Ukraine. Western support for Ukraine\'s government and efforts to broker
a ceasefire to the war there, Moscow believes, are really a plot to
encircle Russia with hostile puppet states and to rob Russia of its
rightful sphere of influence. Repeated Russian warnings that it would go
to war to defend its perceived interests in Ukraine, potentially even
nuclear war, are dismissed in most Western capitals as bluffing, mere
rhetoric. Western leaders view these threats through Western eyes, in
which impoverished Ukraine would never be worth risking a major war. In
Russian eyes, Ukraine looks much more important: an extension of Russian
heritage that is sacrosanct and, as the final remaining component of the
empire, a strategic loss that would unacceptably weaken Russian strength
and thus Russian security. Both side are gambling and guessing in the
absence of a clear understanding of what the other side truly intends,
how it will act, what will and will not trigger the invisible triplines
that would send us careening into war. During the Cold War, the
comparably matched Western and Soviet blocs prepared for war but also
made sure that war never came. They locked Europe in a tense but stable
balance of power; that balance is gone. They set clear red lines and
vowed to defend them at all costs. Today, those red lines are murky and
ill-defined. Neither side is sure where they lie or what really happens
if they are crossed. No one can say for sure what would trigger war.
That is why, analysts will tell you[, today\'s tensions bear far more
similarity to the period before World War I: an unstable power balance,
belligerence over peripheral conflicts, entangling military commitments,
disputes over the future of the European order, and dangerous
uncertainty about what actions will and will not force the other party
into conflict]{.underline}. Today\'s Russia, once more the strongest
nation in Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, calls to
mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire, which Henry Kissinger
described as \"too big for Europe, but too small for the world.\" Now,
as then, a rising power, propelled by nationalism, is seeking to revise
the European order. Now, as then, it believes that through superior
cunning, and perhaps even by proving its might, it can force a larger
role for itself. Now, as then, the drift toward war is gradual and easy
to miss --- which is exactly what makes it so dangerous. But there is
one way in which today\'s dangers are less like those before World War
I, and more similar to those of the Cold War: the apocalyptic logic of
nuclear weapons. [Mutual suspicion, fear of an existential threat,
armies parked across borders from one another, and hair-trigger nuclear
weapons all make any small skirmish a potential
**armageddon**.]{.underline} In some ways, that logic has grown even
more dangerous. Russia, hoping to compensate for its conventional
military forces\' relative weakness, has dramatically relaxed its rules
for using nuclear weapons. Whereas [Soviet leaders saw their nuclear
weapons as pure deterrents]{.underline}, something that existed
precisely so they would never be used, [Putin\'s view appears to be
radically different]{.underline}. [Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine
calls on the country to launch a battlefield nuclear strike in case of a
conventional war that could pose an existential threat]{.underline}.
These are more than just words: Moscow has repeatedly signaled its
willingness and preparations to use nuclear weapons even in a more
limited war. [This is a terrifyingly low bar for nuclear weapons
use]{.underline}, particularly [given that any war would likely occur
along Russia\'s borders and thus not far from Moscow.]{.underline} And
it suggests [Putin has adopted an idea that]{.underline} Cold War
leaders considered unthinkable: that [a \"limited\" nuclear
war]{.underline}, of small warheads dropped on the battlefield, [could
be not only survivable but winnable.]{.underline} [\"It's not just a
difference in rhetoric. It's a whole different world]{.underline},\"
Bruce G. [Blair, a nuclear weapons scholar]{.underline} at Princeton,
[told the W]{.underline}all [S]{.underline}treet [Journal]{.underline}.
He called Putin\'s decisions more dangerous than those of any Soviet
leader since 1962. \"There's a low nuclear threshold now that didn't
exist during the Cold War.\" Nuclear theory is complex and disputable;
maybe Putin is right. But [many theorists]{.underline} would
[say]{.underline} he is wrong, that the logic of nuclear warfare means
[a \"limited\" nuclear strike is in fact likely to trigger a larger
nuclear war --- a **doomsday scenario** in which major American,
Russian, and European cities would be targets for attacks many times
more powerful than the bombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even
if a nuclear war did]{.underline} somehow [remain limited and contained,
**recent studies suggest** that environmental and atmospheric damage
would cause a \"**decade of winter**\" and mass crop die-outs that could
kill up to 1 billion people in a global famine]{.underline}. IV. **[How
it would happen]{.underline}**: The Baltics scenario In September of
last year, President Obama traveled to Estonia, a nation of 1.3 million
people that most Americans have never heard of, and pledged that the
United States would if necessary go to war with Russia to defend it.
[Estonia, along with Latvia and Lithuania]{.underline} --- [together
known as the Baltic states]{.underline} --- are at the far edge of
Eastern Europe, along Russia\'s border. They were formerly part of the
Soviet Union. And they [are where many Western analysts fear **World War
III is likeliest to start**]{.underline}. [These small countries are
\"the most likely front line of any future crisis,\" according
to]{.underline} Stephen [Saideman, an i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [professor]{.underline} at Carleton University.
[Allison and Simes,]{.underline} in their essay warning of war, [called
the Baltics \"the Achilles' heel of]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline}
alliance.\" A full quarter of Estonia\'s population is ethnically
Russian. Clustered on the border with Russia, this minority is served by
the same Russian state media that helped stir up separatist violence
among Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. But [unlike Ukraine, the
Baltic states are all members of NATO, whose charter states that an
attack on one member is an attack on them all]{.underline}. Whereas a
Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Western sanctions, [a Russian
invasion of Estonia would **legally obligate** the US and most of Europe
to declare war]{.underline} [on Moscow]{.underline}.

### AT javelins good

#### Support via future sales of javelins would not solve war -- Ukraine's military is unprepared and it risks US draw in

RA

On his visit to Ukraine this week, the American defense secretary, Jim
Mattis, confirmed that he favors providing "defensive weapons" to the
former Soviet republic. According to recent reports, this military aid
would involve sending Javelin anti-tank guided missiles to Ukraine,
which has been fighting Russian-backed separatists in the eastern
Donbass region for more than three years. [The Trump administration's
plan to arm Kiev is a serious political decision that could have
far-reaching strategic consequences. **The U**nited **S**tates **is
walking into a proxy war** with Moscow --- one that it is unprepared to
win.]{.underline} Notionally, [helping Ukraine is admirable, but the
lack of public discussion and suddenness of this announcement are
worrisome. While arming Kiev may seem like an easy political win, it is
poor policy. The idea of providing Ukraine with \$50 million-worth of
anti-tank missiles is eerily reminiscent of Washington's halfhearted
efforts to train and arm the moderate Syrian opposition.]{.underline}
That plan was ill-conceived and ended in defeat after Russia escalated
its military backing of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in
2015. Russia's interests in Ukraine are far greater and its military
superiority is well established. In contrast, the United States'
coercive credibility in the region is close to nonexistent. [The
proposal to send arms to Kiev is also untimely. Ukraine has not seen a
Russian offensive, or lost significant territory to Russia, in more than
two years.]{.underline} Of all the possible ways to help the country
improve its armed forces, [**dumping missiles on an unreformed military
hardly seems the smart way forward**. This is the time to help the
country transform, not play geopolitical checkers with
missiles.]{.underline} Leading American generals in the region, like the
commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, have long
argued that providing Ukraine with arms, specifically Javelins, would
"not change the situation strategically in a positive way." [There is no
indication of a forthcoming Russian attack, but in any case, the
asymmetry of power between the two countries is so great that no
sensible analyst would argue that a few portable antitank missiles could
tip the balance. Given the nature of the conflict, there is little
chance of exhausting Russia in Ukraine.]{.underline} The Javelin is also
an expensive and impractical choice to give a country with a large
military that already has anti-tank guided missiles, and makes its own.
For \$50 million, which will equip only a fraction of Ukraine's armed
forces with Javelins, Kiev could obtain a much larger number of
comparable weapons from other countries or manufacture more at home.
Most of the casualties in eastern Ukraine have been, and continue to be,
from artillery and small-arms fire. [The conflict has seen very few tank
battles; those that did occur were among small units. Despite the
vaunted number of Russian tanks in Ukraine --- a figure that is likely
exaggerated --- this has never been a war of major tank offensives.
Ukraine's armed forces did employ anti-tank guided missiles and
inflicted losses on the separatists during the battles of August 2014
and February 2015. Yet Kiev failed to achieve victory, and the losses
had little discernible deterrent effect on Russia, which was always
fighting for strategic leverage rather than territory. **The push to
supply Javelin missiles to Ukraine** is really a political decision that
**would turn the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into a proxy war**
between the United States and Russia. Ukrainians may understandably
dream of Washington's joining the conflict, but American policy makers
should remember that their obligation is to their own national interest.
Washington should focus its attention instead on its NATO
allies.]{.underline} If the Trump administration's intent is to send a
signal to Moscow, then American officials should remember that there are
many in the Kremlin willing to send a signal back. Have they considered
the balance of interests, and the capabilities both sides can bring to
bear? Don't bet on it. The United States should also exercise caution in
the signals it sends Ukraine. There is moral hazard for Washington in
belligerently proclaiming support for a nation when it has zero
intention to fight on that nation's behalf. Syria is a recent case study
of how not to win a proxy war that merits closer examination before the
United States embarks on another impulsive venture. [To threaten arming
Ukraine would make sense as part of a hard-nosed negotiation with
Moscow, or as a way to deter Russia from arming insurgent groups in
other conflict zones where the United States is involved militarily,
like Afghanistan. But there seems to be no such strategic purpose here;
senior administration officials simply want to give Ukraine
missiles.]{.underline} Should the Javelin plan go through, the United
States will have wasted its potential future leverage against a
geopolitical adversary by burning one of the few cards it holds for a
political gesture of limited value. If the Trump administration sees the
conflict in Ukraine as part of a new Cold War, it should think harder
about how it plans to win it. Empty signals or a few missiles will not
prevail against this kind of adversary, and they're not a smart way to
help Ukraine, either.

Summary [This paper analyzes the Ukrainian crisis through the lenses of
the contemporary realist schools of the theory of international
relations]{.underline}. One the one hand, it is claimed that **[Russian
responses were motivated by the logic of the balance of powers, upset by
actions taken by the West.]{.underline}** On the other hand, we prove
that [realism still has significant explanatory power in the context of
21st century.]{.underline} The significance of realist thinking in
international relations is unquestionable. [Realism has been the
predominant theory after the emergence of international relations as an
academic discipline, and]{.underline} despite harsh criticism [it has
considerable relevance]{.underline} in the globalized world of the 21st
century (Dunne--Schmidt, 2014:99--112). Nevertheless, it cannot be
regarded as the sole theory, as several schools of realism exist
parallel to one another. Nowadays, and especially after the end of the
Cold War, three different schools predominate the realist way of
thinking: defensive realism, offensive realism and neo-classical
realism. In this paper it is claimed that realism undoubtedly has a
significant explanatory power in the field of international relations,
however, different schools of realism emphasize different aspects of
practical phenomena. As a result, a weakness of one theory can be the
strength of the other, but at the end of the day, realism as a bunch of
different theories suitable for explaining and interpreting the events
of world politics. To prove the above claims, the recent Ukrainian
crisis is analyzed. Theorists and analysts interpret this crisis
differently. [One may claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s
aggressive personality and antidemocratic attitude is responsible for
the recent events, while **others might blame Western intelligence
services for the ouster of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovych**]{.underline}. In this paper, we claim that **[the outbreak
of the military conflict is rooted in the structure of the international
system and its features made Russia to act aggressively]{.underline}**.
To argue for this view, we use the analytical framework of offensive
realism. In addition, [we]{.underline} also [invoke a defensive realist
approach]{.underline} (the other significant branch of structural
realism) and neo-classical realist ideas to make a comparison with and
supplement the offensive realist way of thinking. The paper is
structured as follows: the main characteristics of the three schools of
contemporary realism are described, then they are applied to the
Ukrainian case. Finally, we conclude the main findings of the paper.
Contemporary Theories of Realism Although this paper focuses on
contemporary realist theories, it is unavoidable to spare some words on
their background. Although the description of classical realism --
influenced by the Thukydides, Machiavelli and Hobbes -- falls beyond the
scope of this study, it is worth noting that Morgenthau\'s classical
realism was the predominant school after WWII. Based on a pessimistic
view of man, this unit-level approach deduced its findings from human
nature. Classical realists claimed that since states are led by people,
they also act like people: one state is a wolf to another state and this
is the reason why they pursue power.1 Structural realists also view
international politics as a dangerous game led by pursuit of power but
their approach is quite different. Instead of classical realists\'
state-level angle, structural realists (also called neo-realists) claim
for a systemic approach and deduct their findings from the structure of
international system. This tradition -- inspired by natural sciences and
economic theories of industrial organizations -- was started by Waltz\'s
seminal works and has been followed by others in the recent decades
(Waltz, 1959; 1979). Nowadays, the Waltzian way of structural realism is
often called "defensive realism", while another notable branch,
offensive realism also plays an important role in contemporary
structural realist thinking (Mearsheimer, 2013, 77--93). In spite of
this, structural realism has often been criticized for not being able to
explain new global phenomena of the 21st century. Therefore a new school
of thoughts, neo-classical realism has emerged. In certain respects it
reaches back to the roots of classical realism to supplement the
presumed incompleteness of neo-realism ( Jackson--Sorensen, 2013). In
the following subsections the main features of the three latter theories
are characterized. Since our further analysis is primarily based on
offensive realism, the description begins with its characteristics
including the overview of basic properties of structural realism in the
broader sense. Then the differentiating attributes of the other two
schools are analyzed. Offensive Realism Mearsheimer is considered to be
the leading scholar in offensive realism. The description below about
the nature of offensive realism is based on his seminal book -- The
Tragedy of Great Power Politics -- and his other works (Mearsheimer,
2001). [Offensive realism is built on five bedrock
assumptions:]{.underline} 1.) [The international system is
anarchic]{.underline}. In this respect, [anarchy is not equal to chaos
but refers to the lack of hierarchy]{.underline}. It means that there is
no central authority, "no night watchman" that states could turn to for
help in the case of emergency (Mearsheimer, 2010:387). 2.) Realism
traditionally focuses on states but [offensive realism emphasizes that
great powers are the major players of international politics and each of
them possesses some offensive military capacity]{.underline}. It implies
that "states are potentially dangerous to each other" (Mearsheimer,
2001:30). 3.) "[States can never be certain about other states\'
intentions]{.underline}" (Mearsheimer, 2001:31). This assumption does
not refer to the necessity of hostile intentions but emphasizes the
danger of uncertainty. 4.) [The primary goal of states is
survival]{.underline}. They may have further objectives but they cannot
seek them without securing their own existence. Therefore, survival is
more important than any other motive. 5.) [States are rational
actors]{.underline}. **[This assumption does not exclude the possibility
of miscalculation but claims that states think strategically and act
intentionally and rationally in their best interest]{.underline}**
(Mearsheimer, 2009:241--256). Mearsheimer emphasizes that none of these
assumptions alone implies that states will act aggressively towards each
other, but the "marriage" between these five assumptions create a
dangerous world. Under these circumstances states are afraid of each
other and the only way to secure their own survival is to gain as much
power as possible. However, this intensifies the sense of insecurity in
other states that also make efforts at acting similarly. In this
respect, power is a tool to guarantee survival. In the realist school of
international politics, power is usually measured by military
capacities, but Mearsheimer claims that military power is based on the
socio-economic background of countries. As a result, wealth and the
population -- as the basis of latent power -- also matter. Nevertheless,
[the pursuit of power leads to security competition]{.underline} -- or a
security dilemma, in Herzian terms -- [where "most steps a great power
takes to enhance its own security decrease the security of other
states"]{.underline} (Mearsheimer, 2013:80). Under these circumstances,
the best way for a state to survive is reaching hegemony, in other
words, ruling the system. However, Mearsheimer claims that achieving
global hegemony is unattainable because of the large bodies of water on
the globe. Since offensive realism argues for the primacy of
conventional military forces (i.e. nuclear weapons only serve defensive
goals), oceans prevent great powers from obtaining and sustaining
dominance over distant continents. As a consequence, **[great powers
seek to gain regional hegemony and preempt other states "in other
regions from duplicating their feat"]{.underline}** (Mearsheimer,
2006:160). Nonetheless, [this behavior always generates conflicts
between states. The pursuit of regional hegemony affects the interest of
neighboring states because **it upsets the balance of powers in favour
of the emerging great power**.]{.underline} According to the theory of
offensive realism, the affected states can respond in either of two
ways: they may form a balancing coalition against the potential hegemon,
or choose a \'buck-passing\'2 strategy. In addition, the prevention of
the emergence of another regional hegemon (in another region) is also a
conflictual process. In as much as the existing regional hegemon wants
other regions to be divided it has to contain aspiring hegemons by
forming balancing coalition against them. As a consequence, the rise of
a great power -- which is encoded in the logic of the security
competition under anarchy -- always leads to conflicts and aggressive
strategies. At the end of the day, this is the reason why "international
politics is a nasty and dangerous business" and according to Mearsheimer
"that is the tragedy of great power politics" (Mearsheimer, 2006:162).
Defensive Realism Waltz\'s theory of international politics (Waltz,
1979) represented the "original" way of structural realist thinking, but
after the emergence of Mearsheimer\'s offensive realism, it has often
been labelled as "defensive realism" ( Jackson--Sorensen, 2013;
Mearsheimer, 2013). Nowadays, prominent scholars like Posen, Snyder and
Van Evera belong to this school of thought. Since offensive realism is
built on Waltz\'s systemlevel approach in many respects, the general
features of structural realism are not repeated here. However, the
following description provides an overview of those ideas of defensive
realism which differ from those of offensive realism. The main debate
between the two schools of structural realism concerns the "adequate
amount" of power. Contrary to offensive realism, **[defensive realists
do not think that states want as much power as possible]{.underline}**
(Mearsheimer, 2013). Instead, **[they are considered to strive only for
the appropriate amount of power]{.underline}** (Waltz, 1989:39--52)
**[to maintain the existing balance of powers and to prevent the trigger
of a counterbalancing coalition against them]{.underline}**
(Dunne--Schmidt, 2014). Furthermore, [defensive realists claim that the
costs of conquest often exceed its benefits]{.underline}. In other
words, the "balance between offense and defence" -- which is an
important subject of investigation among defensive realists -- favours
the defensive strategy on many occasions (Van Evera, 1998:5--43).
Therefore, rational actor states prefer the maintenance of balance of
powers to acting aggressively towards others. In sum, "[defensive
realism presents a slightly more optimistic view of international
politics]{.underline}" (Taliaferro, 2000:159). Although defensive
realists also claim that great powers seek to guarantee their survival
in the anarchic structure of international relations, they emphasize
that since the pursuit of power can easily backfire, **[states "temper
their appetite for power"]{.underline}** (Mearsheimer, 2013:82).
Neo-Classical Realism The end of the Cold War basically changed the
international system. New phenomena emerged that challenged structural
realism too. It also provoked the emergence of a new school of realism:
neo-classical realism. Neo-classical realists (e.g. Rose, Schweller,
Zakaria) built their theories mostly on Waltz\'s structural realism,
however, they also reached back to the roots of classical realism.
Moreover, they were also inspired by liberal approaches that dominated
international relations theory at the turn of the millenium (
Jackson--Sorensen, 2013). Neo-classical realists attempt to include
additional -- individual and domestic factors -- in their analysis in
order to move beyond the parsimonous assumptions of neo-realism
(Dunne--Schmidt, 2014). Although they aknowledge the structural realist
argument about the importance of the international anarchy, they claim
that the structure of the international system only provides incentives
for states but it does not predetermine their behavior. The outcome of
foreign policy is influenced by internal characteristics of state and
political leadership, as well as by domestic societal actors, like
interest groups too (Lobell--Ripsman--Taliaferro, 2009; Rose,
1998:144--172). As Rose claims, this approach has much in common with
historical that of institutionalist too. Nonetheless, in this regard,
states are not treated as "like units", and foreign policy becomes an
important tool that may help scholars to explain different strategies
among nations (Dunne--Schmidt, 2014). The Ukrainian Crisis [In 2014,
**several revolutionary events took place in the Ukraine that provoked
the Russian annexation of the Crimea. However, the outbreak of a
military crisis was preceded by actions taken by Western countries**. In
the current section the analytical framework of offensive realism (with
further additions) is used to claim that the outbreak of the crisis was
encoded in the international structure and the aggressive Russian
response was inevitable under the current circumstances.]{.underline}
According to the offensive realist arguments, [the NATO expansion and
the European Union association process are two major factors that must
not be neglected in relation to the Ukrainian crisis]{.underline}
(Mearsheimer, 2014:1--12). Firstly, the 2008 NATO summit held in
Bucharest made an attempt at getting the Ukraine closer to the West. The
Summit Declaration stated that "NATO welcomes Ukraine\'s and Georgia\'s
Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO" and "these countries
will become members of NATO".3 Although further virtual steps were not
taken for the military incorporation of Ukraine into the Western
alliance, the declaration of intent above may be considered as a direct
threat from the Russian point of view. The expansion of the European
Union had a similar but more direct effects on the conflict. Following
the launch of its Eastern Partnership Programme in 2008, [the European
Union]{.underline} planned to sign an [association agreement with the
Ukraine]{.underline}, which was declined by Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovich at the end of 2013. This association would have meant the
economic integration of Ukraine in the West. However, this act [would
have been a hostile action to Russia\'s interest]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, this veto provoked serious protests in the Ukraine that
led to the overthrow of President Yanukovich and finally made Russia to
respond by military intervention in Ukraine. Anyway, **[the structural
realist]{.underline}** (both offensive and defensive realist)
**[interpretation of the events is straightforward: the Ukraine\'s
incorporation into the Western]{.underline}** -- either economic or
**[military]{.underline}** -- **[institutions would have upset the
balance of powers, and Russia could not let that happen. The reason why
Putin answered aggressively was not of his personal attitude or
irrationality but since the structure of international system made him
to act so. As Western actions attempted to alter the status quo of the
relative power which would reduce Russia\'s sense of security, the
principles of realists\' self-help world forced Putin to react by
military means. In this respect, Russian military intervention in the
Crimea and Eastern Ukraine served as a radical step towards the
recuperation of the balance of powers.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, the
explanations given for the Western strategy may differ among -- and even
within -- different realist approaches. The fact that the virtual actor
behind the term "West" is not straightforward also complicates
interpretation. Although the United States can be considered as a major
actor in the conflict, officially it has nothing to do with the European
Union\'s association agreement. Considering the European Union as the
main Western actor is also problematic: according to structural realism,
states are the only significant players in international politics,
moreover, the European Union does not even have an effective common
foreign policy. Nonetheless, we ignore these counterarguments and
consider that the US (as the leading country of NATO) and the European
Union as such were the main actors within the Western alliances.
Regarding NATO expansion, a regular offensive realist argument could
suggest that the United States -- as a regional hegemon in the Western
Hemisphere -- wanted to prevent the emergence of another potential
regional hegemon. However, **[Russia cannot be considered as an aspiring
hegemon]{.underline}**. In spite of Europe\'s dependence on Russian
energy, **[Russia is not a prosperous country]{.underline}**. Although
it has remarkable military capacities, **[their technology is quite
old-fashioned and the country\'s latent power -- based on its economic
potential -- is also weak]{.underline}**. Thus as Mearsheimer claims
(Mearsheimer, 2014), [Russia is a declining power which implies that the
United States need not have to make attempts at containing it by
expanding NATO\'s sphere of interest.]{.underline} Accepting the above
argument, offensive realists might also claim that a miscalculation or
simply mistaken decisions were made both in the US and in the European
Union. Such actions are more common if the security of the state is not
in danger, as then they can pursue further goals besides survival. In
this respect, one might claim that overconfidence about their own
security made the US and the European Union to move into Russia\'s
backyard without thinking through the consequences of this act. **[The
Ukraine\'s Western integration does not fit into the defensive realist
theory]{.underline}** either. [According to them, rational actors temper
their appetite for power in order to prevent conflicts. Nonetheless,
this did not happen to the West in the case of the Ukrainian crisis, and
as a result, instead of maintaining the balance of powers, they upset
it.]{.underline} However, [neo-classical realism may provide
explanations]{.underline} for these strategically wrong actions. They
might claim that [American and European decision-makers were influenced
by domestic factors]{.underline} (e.g. need for vote-maximization in
domestic politics; pressure from the proponents of democracy export and
from business interest groups etc.). According to this interpretation,
[constraints on the anarchic international system were ineffective on
Western politicians, who subjected their foreign policy to secondary
goals]{.underline} (instead of taking care of the balance of powers).
Though, neo-classical arguments provide a plausible explanation for the
behaviour of Western countries, it may shed new light on Russian
strategy too. Namely, domestic factors might have influenced Russian
President Putin too. Although [the idea about a rough Putin who wants to
show strength to his own people]{.underline}, come from the liberal
schools of international relations, it might be compatible with
neo-classical realism too. Nevertheless, this view [cannot overwrite the
fact -- which is a recognized one in neo-classical realism too -- that
**aggressive response was mainly motivated by the crude logic of balance
of power.**]{.underline} Conclusions This paper aims to overview the
main characteristics of contemporary realist theories and intended to
show their applicability in the globalized world of 21st century. [As
presented in the case study about the Ukrainian crisis, **realism has
not lost its explanatory power** after the Cold War: the world has not
changed and international relations are still governed by great power
politics.]{.underline} We also showed that [different schools of
contemporary realism may perform differently in interpreting distinct
aspects of international events but at the end of the day, **realism as
a bunch of several theories is completely able to explain them. In the
case of the Ukrainian crisis**]{.underline}, we claimed that **[Russian
response was primarily motivated by the logic of the balance of powers.
Since the West moved into Russia\'s sphere of interest, Putin was forced
to apply his own version of the "Monroe Doctrine"]{.underline}**
(Mearsheimer, 2014). **[In this respect, Russia was not driven by "evil
intentions", but by the everlasting logic of great power
politics.]{.underline}**

[According to the]{.underline} prevailing wisdom in the [West, the
Ukraine crisis can be blamed almost entirely on Russian
aggression]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir Putin, the argument
goes, annexed Crimea out of a long-standing desire to resuscitate the
Soviet empire, and he may eventually go after the rest of Ukraine, as
well as other countries in eastern Europe. In this view, the ouster of
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 merely provided a
pretext for Putin\'s decision to order Russian forces to seize part of
Ukraine. But **[this account is wrong: the United States and its
European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis. The
taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement, the central element of a
larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russia\'s orbit and integrate it
into the West]{.underline}**. At the same time, [**the EU\'s expansion
eastward and the West\'s backing of the pro-democracy movement in
Ukraine**-beginning with the Orange Revolution in 2004-**were critical
elements, too**]{.underline}. Since the mid-1990s, [Russian
leaders]{.underline} have adamantly opposed NATO enlargement, and in
recent years, they have made it clear that they [would not stand by
while their strategically important neighbor turned into a Western
bastion]{.underline}. **[For Putin, the illegal overthrow of Ukraine\'s
democratically elected and pro-Russian president-which he rightly
labeled a \"coup\"-was the final straw]{.underline}**. [He responded by
taking Crimea, a peninsula he feared would host a NATO naval base, and
working to destabilize Ukraine until it abandoned its efforts to join
the West]{.underline}. [Putin\'s pushback should have come as no
surprise]{.underline}. After all, **[the West had been moving into
Russia\'s backyard and threatening its core strategic
interests]{.underline}**, a point Putin made emphatically and
repeatedly. **[Elites in the United States and Europe]{.underline}**
have been blindsided by events only because they **[subscribe to a
flawed view of international politics. They tend to
believe]{.underline}** that the logic of [**realism holds little
relevance in the twenty-first century** and]{.underline} that [Europe
can be kept whole and free on the basis of such liberal principles as
the rule of law, economic interdependence, and democracy]{.underline}.
But this grand scheme went awry **[in Ukraine]{.underline}**. The crisis
there shows that **[realpolitik remains relevant-and states that ignore
it do so at their own peril]{.underline}**. U.S. and European leaders
blundered in attempting to turn Ukraine into a Western stronghold on
Russia\'s border. Now that the consequences have been laid bare, **[it
would be an even greater mistake to continue this misbegotten
policy]{.underline}**. THE WESTERN AFFRONT As the Cold War came to a
close, Soviet leaders preferred that U.S. forces remain in Europe and
NATO stay intact, an arrangement they thought would keep a reunified
Germany pacified. But they and their Russian successors did not want
NATO to grow any larger and assumed that [Western diplomats]{.underline}
understood their concerns. The Clinton administration evidently thought
otherwise, and in the mid-1990s, it [began pushing for NATO to
expand]{.underline}. The first round of enlargement took place in 1999
and brought [in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland]{.underline}.
The second occurred in 2004; it included [Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia]{.underline}. Moscow
complained bitterly from the start. During NATO\'s 1995 bombing campaign
against the Bosnian Serbs, for example, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said, \"This is the first sign of what could happen **[when NATO comes
right up to the Russian]{.underline}** Federation\'s
**[borders]{.underline}**\.... The flame of **[war could burst out
across the whole of Europe]{.underline}**.\" But the Russians were too
weak at the time to derail NATO\'s eastward movement-which, at any rate,
did not look so threatening, since none of the new members shared a
border with Russia, save for the tiny Baltic countries. Then [NATO began
looking further east]{.underline}. At its April 2008 summit in
Bucharest, [the alliance considered **admitting Georgia and
Ukraine**]{.underline}. The George W. Bush administration supported
doing so, but France and Germany opposed the move for fear that it would
unduly antagonize Russia. In the end, [NATO\'s members reached a
compromise:]{.underline} the alliance did not begin the formal process
leading to membership, but it issued a statement [endorsing the
aspirations of Georgia and Ukraine and boldly declaring, \"These
countries will become members of NATO.\"]{.underline} Moscow, however,
did not see the outcome as much of a compromise. Alexander Grushko, then
Russia\'s deputy foreign minister, said, \"Georgia\'s and Ukraine\'s
membership in the alliance is a huge strategic mistake which would have
most serious consequences for pan-European security.\" [Putin maintained
that admitting those two countries to NATO would represent a \"direct
threat\" to Russia.]{.underline} One Russian newspaper reported that
Putin, while speaking with Bush, \"very transparently hinted that if
Ukraine was accepted into NATO, it would cease to exist.\" Russia\'s
invasion of Georgia in August 2008 should have dispelled any remaining
doubts about Putin\'s determination to prevent Georgia and Ukraine from
joining NATO. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who was deeply
committed to bringing his country into NATO, had decided in the summer
of 2008 to reincorporate two separatist regions, Abkhazia and South
Ossetia. But Putin sought to keep Georgia weak and divided-and out of
NATO. After fighting broke out between the Georgian government and South
Ossetian separatists, Russian forces took control of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia. Moscow had made its point. Yet despite this clear warning, NATO
never publicly abandoned its goal of bringing Georgia and Ukraine into
the alliance. And NATO expansion continued marching forward, with
Albania and Croatia becoming members in 2009. [The EU, too, has been
marching eastward]{.underline}. In May 2008, it unveiled its Eastern
Partnership initiative, a program to foster prosperity in such countries
as Ukraine and integrate them into the EU economy. Not surprisingly,
**[Russian leaders view the plan as hostile to their country\'s
interests]{.underline}**. This past February, before Yanukovych was
forced from office, [Russian Foreign Minister]{.underline} Sergey
[Lavrov accused the EU of trying to create a \"sphere of influence\" in
eastern Europe]{.underline}. [**In the eyes of Russian leaders, EU
expansion is a stalking horse for NATO expansion**. The West\'s final
tool for peeling Kiev away from Moscow has been its efforts to spread
Western values and promote democracy in Ukraine and other post-Soviet
states, a plan that often entails funding pro-Western individuals and
organizations]{.underline}. Victoria Nuland, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, estimated in
December 2013 that the United States had invested more than \$5 billion
since 1991 to help Ukraine achieve \"the future it deserves.\" As part
of that effort, the U.S. government has bankrolled the National
Endowment for Democracy. The nonprofit foundation has funded more than
60 projects aimed at promoting civil society in Ukraine, and the NEDS
president, Carl Gershman, has called that country \"the biggest prize.\"
After Yanukovych won Ukraine\'s presidential election in February 2010,
the NED decided he was undermining its goals, and so it stepped up its
efforts to support the opposition and strengthen the country\'s
democratic institutions. **[When Russian leaders look at Western social
engineering in Ukraine, they worry that their country might be next. And
such fears are hardly groundless]{.underline}**. In September 2013,
[Gershman wrote]{.underline} in The Washington Post, [\"Ukraine\'s
choice to join Europe will accelerate the demise of the ideology of
Russian imperialism that Putin represents.\"]{.underline} He added:
\"Russians, too, face a choice, and Putin may find himself on the losing
end not just in the near abroad but within Russia itself.\" CREATING A
CRISIS **[The West\'s triple package of]{.underline}** policies-[**NATO
enlargement, EU expansion, and democracy promotion-added fuel to a fire
waiting to ignite**. The spark came in November 2013, when
Yanukovych]{.underline} rejected a major economic deal he had been
negotiating with the EU and decided to [accept a \$15 billion Russian
counteroffer]{.underline} instead. That decision gave rise to
antigovernment demonstrations that escalated over the following three
months and that by mid-February had led to the deaths of some one
hundred protesters. Western emissaries hurriedly flew to Kiev to resolve
the crisis. On February 21, the government and the opposition struck a
deal that allowed Yanukovych to stay in power until new elections were
held. But it immediately fell apart, and Yanukovych fled to Russia the
next day. [The new government in Kiev was pro-Western and anti-Russian
to the core, and it contained four high-ranking members who could
legitimately be labeled neofascists]{.underline}. Although the full
extent of U.S. involvement has not yet come to light, it is clear that
**[Washington backed the coup]{.underline}**. Nuland and Republican
Senator John McCain participated in antigovernment demonstrations, and
Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, proclaimed after
Yanukovych\'s toppling that it was \"a day for the history books.\" As a
leaked telephone recording revealed, Nuland had advocated regime change
and wanted the Ukrainian politician Arseniy Yatsenyuk to become prime
minister in the new government, which he did. No wonder Russians of all
persuasions think [the West played a role in Yanukovych\'s ouster. For
Putin, the time to act against Ukraine and the West had
arrived]{.underline}. Shortly after February 22, he ordered Russian
forces to take Crimea from Ukraine, and soon after that, he incorporated
it into Russia. The task proved relatively easy, thanks to the thousands
of Russian troops already stationed at a naval base in the Crimean port
of Sevastopol. Crimea also made for an easy target since ethnic Russians
compose roughly 60 percent of its population. Most of them wanted out of
Ukraine. Next, [Putin put massive pressure on the new government in Kiev
to discourage it from siding with the West against Moscow, making it
clear that **he would wreck Ukraine as a functioning state before he
would allow it to become a Western stronghold on Russia\'s doorstep.
Toward that end, he has provided advisers, arms, and diplomatic support
to the Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine**]{.underline}, who are
pushing the country toward civil war. [He has massed a large army on the
Ukrainian border]{.underline}, threatening to invade if the government
cracks down on the rebels. And he has sharply raised the price of the
natural gas Russia sells to Ukraine and demanded payment for past
exports. Putin is playing hardball. THE DIAGNOSIS **[Putin\'s actions
should be easy to comprehend]{.underline}**. A huge expanse of flat land
that Napoleonic France, imperial Germany, and Nazi Germany all crossed
to strike at Russia itself, [**Ukraine serves as a buffer state of
enormous strategic importance to Russia. No Russian leader would
tolerate a military alliance that was Moscow\'s mortal enemy until
recently moving into Ukraine**. Nor would any Russian leader stand idly
by while the West helped install a government there that was determined
to integrate Ukraine into the West]{.underline}. Washington may not like
Moscow\'s position, but it should understand the logic behind it. This
is Geopolitics 101: **[great powers are always sensitive to potential
threats near their home territory]{.underline}**. After all, the United
States does not tolerate distant great powers deploying military forces
anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, much less on its borders. **[Imagine
the outrage in Washington if China built an impressive military alliance
and tried to include Canada and Mexico]{.underline}** in it. Logic
aside, [Russian leaders have told their Western counterparts on many
occasions that they consider NATO expansion into Georgia and Ukraine
unacceptable]{.underline}, along with any effort to turn those countries
against Russia-a message that the 2008 Russian-Georgian war also made
crystal clear. Officials from the United States and its European allies
contend that they tried hard to assuage Russian fears and that Moscow
should understand that NATO has no designs on Russia. In addition to
continually denying that its expansion was aimed at containing Russia,
the alliance has never permanently deployed military forces in its new
member states. In 2002, it even created a body called the NATO-Russia
Council in an effort to foster cooperation. To further mollify Russia,
the United States announced in 2009 that it would deploy its new missile
defense system on warships in European waters, at least initially,
rather than on Czech or Polish territory. But none of these measures
worked; the Russians remained steadfastly opposed to NATO enlargement,
especially into Georgia and Ukraine. And [**it is the Russians, not the
West, who ultimately get to decide what counts as a threat to them**. To
understand why the]{.underline} [West, especially the United States,
failed to understand that **its Ukraine policy was laying the groundwork
for a major clash with Russia**, one must go back to the
mid-1990s]{.underline}, when the Clinton administration began advocating
NATO expansion. Pundits advanced a variety of arguments for and against
enlargement, but there was no consensus on what to do. Most eastern
European emigres in the United States and their relatives, for example,
strongly supported expansion, because they wanted NATO to protect such
countries as Hungary and Poland. A few realists also favored the policy
because they thought Russia still needed to be contained. But **[most
realists opposed expansion, in the belief that a declining great power
with an aging population and a one-dimensional economy did not in fact
need to be contained]{.underline}**. And they feared that **[enlargement
would only give Moscow an incentive to cause trouble in eastern
Europe]{.underline}**. The U.S. diplomat [George Kennan articulated this
perspective]{.underline} in a 1998 interview, shortly [after the U.S.
Senate approved]{.underline} the first round of [NATO
expansion]{.underline}. \"I think [the Russians will gradually react
quite adversely and it will affect their policies]{.underline},\" he
said. \"I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this
whatsoever. No one was threatening anyone else.\" [Most
liberals]{.underline}, on the other hand, [favored
enlargement]{.underline}, including many key members of the Clinton
administration. They believed that the end of the Cold War had
fundamentally transformed international politics and that a new,
post-national order had replaced the realist logic that used to govern
Europe. The United States was not only the \"indispensable nation,\" as
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright put it; it was also a benign
hegemon and thus unlikely to be viewed as a threat in Moscow. [The
aim]{.underline}, in essence, [was to make the entire continent look
like western Europe]{.underline}. And so the United States and its
allies sought to promote democracy in the countries of eastern Europe,
increase economic interdependence among them, and embed them in
international institutions. Having won the debate in the United States,
liberals had little difficulty convincing their European allies to
support NATO enlargement. After all, given the EU\'s past achievements,
Europeans were even more wedded than Americans to the idea that
geopolitics no longer mattered and that an all-inclusive liberal order
could maintain peace in Europe. So thoroughly did liberals come to
dominate the discourse about European security during the first decade
of this century that even as the alliance adopted an open-door policy of
growth, NATO expansion faced little realist opposition. **[The liberal
worldview is now accepted dogma among U.S. officials]{.underline}**. In
March, for example, President Barack [Obama]{.underline} delivered a
speech about Ukraine in which he [talked repeatedly about \"the ideals\"
that motivate Western policy]{.underline} and how those ideals \"have
often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power.\"
Secretary of State John [Kerry\'s response to the Crimea crisis
reflected this same perspective]{.underline}: \"You just don\'t in the
twentyfirst century behave in nineteenth-century fashion by invading
another country on completely trumped-up pretext.\" **[In essence, the
two sides have been operating with different playbooks: Putin and his
compatriots have been thinking and acting according to realist dictates,
whereas their Western counterparts have been adhering to liberal ideas
about international politics]{.underline}**. The result is that **[the
United States and its allies unknowingly provoked a major crisis over
Ukraine]{.underline}**. BLAME GAME In that same 1998 interview, Kennan
predicted that NATO expansion would provoke a crisis, after which the
proponents of expansion would \"say that we always told you that is how
the Russians are.\" As if on cue, [most Western officials have portrayed
Putin as the real culprit in the Ukraine predicament]{.underline}. In
March, according to The New York Times, German Chancellor Angela Merkel
implied that Putin was irrational, telling Obama that he was \"in
another world.\" [Although Putin]{.underline} no doubt [has autocratic
tendencies, no evidence supports the charge that he is mentally
unbalanced]{.underline}. On the contrary: [he is a first-class
strategist who should be feared and respected]{.underline} by anyone
challenging him on foreign policy. **[Other analysts
allege]{.underline}**, more plausibly, **[that Putin regrets the demise
of the Soviet Union and is determined to reverse it]{.underline}** by
expanding Russia\'s borders. According to this interpretation, Putin,
having taken Crimea, is now testing the waters to see if the time is
right to conquer Ukraine, or at least its eastern part, and he will
eventually behave aggressively toward other countries in Russia\'s
neighborhood. [For some in this camp, Putin represents a modern-day
Adolf Hitler, and striking any kind of deal with him would repeat the
mistake of Munich. **Thus, NATO must admit Georgia and Ukraine to
contain Russia**]{.underline} before it dominates its neighbors and
threatens western Europe. [**This argument falls apart on close
inspection**. If Putin were committed to creating a greater Russia,
signs of his intentions would almost certainly have arisen before
February 22]{.underline}. But [**there is virtually no evidence that he
was bent on taking Crimea, much less any other territory in Ukraine,
before that date**. Even Western leaders who supported NATO expansion
were not doing so out of a fear that Russia was about to use military
force. **Putin\'s actions in Crimea took them by complete surprise and
appear to have been a spontaneous reaction to Yanukovych\'s
ouster**]{.underline}. Right afterward, even Putin said he opposed
Crimean secession, before quickly changing his mind. Besides, even if it
wanted to, **[Russia lacks the capability to easily conquer and annex
eastern Ukraine, much less the entire country.]{.underline}** Roughly
[15 million people]{.underline}-one-third of Ukraine\'s population-live
between the Dnieper River, which bisects the country, and the Russian
border. An overwhelming majority of those people [want to remain part of
Ukraine and **would surely resist a Russian occupation**]{.underline}.
**[Furthermore, Russia\'s mediocre army]{.underline}**, which shows few
signs of turning into a modern Wehrmacht, **[would have little chance of
pacifying all of Ukraine. Moscow is also poorly positioned to pay for a
costly occupation; its weak economy would suffer even
more]{.underline}** in the face of the resulting sanctions. But **[even
if Russia did boast a powerful military]{.underline}** machine **[and an
impressive economy, it would still probably prove unable to successfully
occupy Ukraine]{.underline}**. One need only [consider]{.underline} the
Soviet and U.S. experiences in [Afghanistan]{.underline}, the U.S.
experiences in [Vietnam and Iraq, and]{.underline} the Russian
experience in [Chechnya]{.underline} to be reminded that military
occupations usually end badly. **[Putin]{.underline}** surely
[understands]{.underline} that trying to subdue Ukraine would be like
swallowing a porcupine. His **[response to events there has been
defensive, not offensive]{.underline}**. A WAY OUT Given that **[most
Western leaders continue to deny that Putin\'s behavior might be
motivated by legitimate security concerns]{.underline}**, it is
unsurprising that they have tried to modify it by doubling down on their
existing policies and have punished Russia to deter further aggression.
Although Kerry has maintained that \"all options are on the table,\"
neither the United States nor its NATO allies are prepared to use force
to defend Ukraine. The West is relying instead on economic sanctions to
coerce Russia into ending its support for the insurrection in eastern
Ukraine. In July, the United States and the EU put in place their third
round of limited sanctions, targeting mainly high-level individuals
closely tied to the Russian government and some high-profile banks,
energy companies, and defense firms. They also threatened to unleash
another, tougher round of sanctions, aimed at whole sectors of the
Russian economy. Such measures will have little effect. Harsh sanctions
are likely off the table anyway; western European countries, especially
Germany, have resisted imposing them for fear that Russia might
retaliate and cause serious economic damage within the EU. But [even if
the United States could convince its allies to enact tough measures,
Putin would probably not alter his decision-making]{.underline}. History
shows that [countries will absorb enormous amounts of punishment in
order to protect their core strategic interests]{.underline}. There is
no reason to think Russia represents an exception to this rule.
**[Western leaders have also clung to the provocative policies that
precipitated the crisis in the first place]{.underline}**. In April,
U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden met with Ukrainian legislators and told
them, \"This is a second opportunity to make good on the original
promise made by the Orange Revolution.\" John Brennan, the director of
the CIA, did not help things when, that same month, he visited Kiev on a
trip [the White House]{.underline} said [was aimed at improving security
cooperation with the Ukrainian government]{.underline}. The EU,
meanwhile, has continued to push its Eastern Partnership. In March, Jose
Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, summarized EU
thinking on Ukraine, saying, \"We have a debt, a duty of solidarity with
that country, and we will work to have them as close as possible to
us.\" And sure enough, on June 27, the EU and Ukraine signed the
economic agreement that Yanukovych had fatefully rejected seven months
earlier. Also in June, at a meeting of NATO members\' foreign ministers,
it was agreed that the alliance would remain open to new members,
although the foreign ministers refrained from mentioning Ukraine by
name. \"No third country has a veto over NATO enlargement,\" announced
Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO\'s secretary-general. [The foreign ministers
also agreed to support various measures to improve Ukraine\'s military
capabilities in such areas as command and control, logistics, and
cyberdefense]{.underline}. **[Russian leaders have naturally recoiled at
these actions; the West\'s response to the crisis will only make a bad
situation worse. There is a solution to the crisis in
Ukraine]{.underline}**, however-[**although it would require the West to
think about the country in a fundamentally new way. The United States
and its allies should abandon their plan to westernize Ukraine and
instead aim to make it a neutral buffer between NATO and Russia**, akin
to Austria\'s position during the Cold War]{.underline}. Western leaders
should acknowledge that Ukraine matters so much to Putin that they
cannot support an anti-Russian regime there. [This would not mean that a
future Ukrainian government would have to be pro-Russian]{.underline} or
anti-NATO. On the contrary, the goal should be a sovereign Ukraine that
falls in neither the Russian nor the Western camp. To achieve this end,
the United States and its allies should publicly rule out NATO\'s
expansion into both Georgia and Ukraine. The West should also help
fashion an economic rescue plan for Ukraine funded jointly by the EU,
the International Monetary Fund, Russia, and the United States-a
proposal that Moscow should welcome, given its interest in having a
prosperous and stable Ukraine on its western flank. And the West should
considerably limit its social-engineering efforts inside Ukraine. [It is
time to put an end to Western support for another Orange
Revolution]{.underline}. Nevertheless, U.S. and European leaders should
encourage Ukraine to respect minority rights, especially the language
rights of its Russian speakers. [Some may argue that changing policy
toward Ukraine at this late date would seriously damage U.S. credibility
around the world]{.underline}. There would undoubtedly be certain costs,
but **[the costs of continuing a misguided strategy would be much
greater]{.underline}**. Furthermore, other countries are likely to
respect a state that learns from its mistakes and ultimately devises a
policy that deals effectively with the problem at hand. That option is
clearly open to the United States. One also hears the claim that Ukraine
has the right to determine whom it wants to ally with and the Russians
have no right to prevent Kiev from joining the West. This is a dangerous
way for Ukraine to think about its foreign policy choices. The sad truth
is that might often makes right when great-power politics are at play.
Abstract rights such as self-determination are largely meaningless when
powerful states get into brawls with weaker states. Did Cuba have the
right to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union during the Cold
War? The United States certainly did not think so, and the Russians
think the same way about Ukraine joining the West. It is in Ukraine\'s
interest to understand these facts of life and tread carefully when
dealing with its more powerful neighbor. Even if one rejects this
analysis, however, and believes that Ukraine has the right to petition
to join the EU and NATO, the fact remains that the United States and its
European allies have the right to reject these requests. There is no
reason that the West has to accommodate [Ukraine]{.underline} if it is
bent on pursuing a wrong-headed foreign policy, especially if its
[defense is not a vital interest.]{.underline} Indulging the dreams of
some Ukrainians is not worth the animosity and strife it will cause,
especially for the Ukrainian people. Of course, **[some analysts
might]{.underline}** concede that NATO handled relations with Ukraine
poorly and yet still **[maintain that Russia constitutes an enemy that
will only grow more formidable over time-and that the West therefore has
no choice but to continue its present policy. But this viewpoint is
badly mistaken.]{.underline}** **[Russia is a declining power, and it
will only get weaker with time]{.underline}**. Even if Russia were a
rising power, moreover, it would still make no sense to incorporate
Ukraine into NATO. The reason is simple: [the United States and its
European allies do not consider Ukraine to be a core strategic interest,
as their unwillingness to use military force to come to its aid has
proved]{.underline}. It would therefore be the height of folly to create
a new NATO member that the other members have no intention of defending.
NATO has expanded in the past because liberals assumed the alliance
would never have to honor its new security guarantees, but Russia\'s
recent power play shows that **[granting Ukraine NATO membership could
put Russia and the West on a collision course]{.underline}**. [Sticking
with the current policy would also complicate Western relations with
Moscow on other issues. The United States needs Russia\'s assistance to
withdraw U.S. equipment from Afghanistan through Russian territory,
reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, and stabilize the situation in
Syria.]{.underline} In fact, Moscow has helped Washington on all three
of these issues in the past; in the summer of 2013, it was Putin who
pulled Obama\'s chestnuts out of the fire by forging the deal under
which Syria agreed to relinquish its chemical weapons, thereby avoiding
the U.S. military strike that Obama had threatened. [The United States
will also someday need Russia\'s help containing a rising
China]{.underline}. [Current U.S. policy]{.underline}, however, [is only
driving Moscow and Beijing closer together]{.underline}. **[The United
States and its European allies now face a choice on Ukraine. They can
continue their current policy, which will exacerbate hostilities with
Russia and devastate Ukraine in]{.underline}** the process-a scenario in
which everyone would come out a loser. **[Or they can switch gears and
work to create a prosperous but neutral Ukraine, one that does not
threaten Russia and allows the West to repair its relations with Moscow.
With that approach, all sides would win.]{.underline}**

### L -- NoKo retal

#### Ukraine responds to arms sales by retaliating against peace in the peninsula 

**Bandow** 12-29-20**17** (Doug, "Arming Ukraine Likely To Escalate
Fruitless Conflict And Risk Needless Confrontation With Russia,"
Huffington Post,

Most Americans were told Donald [Trump]{.underline} won the presidential
election last year. But his policy toward Russia looks suspiciously like
that which would be expected from a President Hillary Clinton. In
particular, the apparent [decision to arm Ukraine against Russian in the
proxy conflict in the Donbass will encourage Moscow to
retaliate]{.underline} not only in Ukraine but [against U.S. interests
**elsewhere around the globe**]{.underline}. With over 10,000 dead, the
conflict in [Ukraine]{.underline} [is]{.underline} a humanitarian
travesty but [of minimal security consequence to America and
Europe]{.underline}. Indeed, Kiev's status never was key to Europe's
status. Part of the Soviet Union and before that the Russian Empire,
Ukraine turned into an unexpected bonus for the allies by seceding from
the Soviet Union, greatly diminishing the latter's population and
territory. Russia's seizure of Crimea and battle in the Donbass
destabilized an already semi-failed state, but did not materially alter
the European balance of power. Or demonstrate anything other than
Moscow's brutal yet limited ambitions. In fact, present allied policy
makes continuation of the current conflict almost inevitable. Newly
released documents demonstrate that Soviet officials reasonably believed
releasing their Warsaw Pact captives would not lead to NATO's expansion
to Russia's border. Americans might believe that Moscow should not fear
such an advance, but Russia sees geographical space and buffer states as
critical for its security, and none are more important than Ukraine.
Expanding NATO, disregarding Moscow's historic interests in the Balkans,
dismantling onetime Slavic ally Serbia, aiding "color revolutions" that
brought anti-Russian governments to power along its border, announcing
the intention of inducting both Georgia and Ukraine into the alliance
created to confront Moscow, and finally ostentatiously backing a street
revolution against a corrupt but elected leader friendly to
Russia---going to far as to discuss who should rule after his planned
ouster---could not help but be viewed as hostile in Moscow. [One can
imagine how Washington would react to similar events in Canada or
Mexico. Not well]{.underline}. Russia's response was unjustified but
brutally efficient and, most important, limited. Moscow grabbed Crimea,
the only part of Ukraine with a majority of Russian-speakers (who
probably favored joining Russia, though the subsequent referendum
occurred in what was occupied Crimea). Moscow further backed separatists
in Eastern Ukraine, perhaps in hopes of grabbing territory or merely
bleeding Kiev. Some Western responses were near hysteria, imagining a
blitzkrieg attack on Ukraine, conquering the country. The Baltic States
saw themselves as the next targets. Poland remembered its 20th Century
conflicts with Moscow. At least one observer added Finland to Moscow's
potential target list. Others worried about intimidation of allied
states, borders being withdrawn, and challenges to the European order.
Some afflicted with war fever feared an attempt to reconstitute the
Soviet Union and perhaps roll west from there. None of which happened.
Perhaps President Vladimir Putin secretly was an Adolf Hitler-wannabe
but was dissuaded by the U.S. and NATO response. However, economic
sanctions and military deployments were modest. Assistance to Ukraine
did not include lethal military aid. Most likely, [Putin never intended
to start World War III]{.underline}. [Instead, he took advantage of the
opportunity to snatch Crimea, the territory with the closest
identification with Moscow]{.underline}, simultaneously safeguarding the
latter's major Black Sea base, and create a frozen conflict in the
Donbass, effectively preventing Ukraine's entry into NATO. Russia's
activity there also gives him an opportunity to create additional
trouble for the U.S. [Moscow's policy is unpleasant]{.underline} for
America and Europe, but only prevents the allies from doing which is not
in their interest: inducting a security black hole into NATO. Even
before 2014, Ukraine was a political and economic mess. While
independent it mattered little for Western security, in NATO it would
bring along all of its disputes and potential conflicts with Russia, a
touchy, nationalistic nuclear power. What State Department called
"enhanced defensive capabilities," which require congressional approval,
aren't likely to raise the price of the conflict enough to force Russia
to back down. [The Putin regime has far more at stake in preserving its
gains than the U.S. does in reversing them]{.underline}. [Moscow also is
better able to escalate and is likely to consistently outbid the West:
Putin's advantages include greater interest, geographic closeness, and
popular support]{.underline}. [For Ukraine more weapons would at most
mean more fighting, with little additional advantage]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the plan to arm Kiev with weapons]{.underline}, especially if
anti-tank missiles are included, as news reports indicate, [would risk
turning the Donbass conflict from cool to warm and perhaps
more]{.underline}. Ukraine already joins Russia in failing to implement
the Minsk Agreement. [Kiev]{.underline} would not only be better armed,
but [might believe that it enjoyed an implicit guarantee from
Washington, which in turn would have more at stake and thus be less
inclined to abandon its new "investment."]{.underline} Then what if
Moscow escalated? In 2014 the Putin government deployed Russian military
units to counter Ukrainian gains. Would Washington do likewise in
response to Moscow? At the same time, [transferring lethal arms would
divide the U.S. from European nations, many of which oppose further
confrontation with Russia, especially over Ukraine]{.underline}.
Brussels already bridled at Congress' new sanctions legislation, which
passed without consulting the Europeans and targeted European firms. [If
Moscow responds]{.underline} with escalation, [Washington may find **no
one behind it**]{.underline}. [Providing lethal weapons would almost
certainly encourage the Ukrainians to press for even heavier arms and
escalate the fighting, as well as discourage them from negotiating a
settlement]{.underline}. U.S. officials refer to the weapons as
defensive, but their capabilities are not so easily compartmentalized.
Said Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the
"ability to stop armored vehicles would be essential for them to protect
themselves." True, but the ability to disable tanks is useful on offense
as well as defense. There has been little movement in the battle line
over the last couple of years. [New U.S. weapons aren't necessary to
preserve the status quo. Rather, they would most help Ukraine press
harder for a military solution]{.underline}. Does Kiev want to accept a
compromise peace or fight on? Obama Pentagon official Michael Carpenter
said providing weapons "will be a huge boost of support to Ukraine."
Moscow is not concerned about Kiev's military potential. Russia is
concerned that the U.S. and Europe say they intend to induct Ukraine
into NATO. [The closer the military ties grow between America and
Ukraine, the greater Moscow's incentive to keep the conflict
going]{.underline}. [Russia also has opportunities to **retaliate
against American interests elsewhere**]{.underline}. Deputy Foreign
Minister Sergey Ryabkov said: "The United States crossed the line in a
sense" and "may lead to new victims in a country that is neighboring
us." America, he added, was an "accomplice in fueling war" That might be
just talk, but [Russia can provide aid, sell arms, offer political
backing, and give economic assistance in ways that hamper U.S.
activities]{.underline}. Afghanistan, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, North Korea,
Syria, and Venezuela all provide opportunities for Russian mischief.
[Moscow **could refuse to back additional sanctions on Pyongyang or even
provide the latter with S-400 anti-aircraft missiles**]{.underline}.
[Although limited resources constrain Moscow, politics encourages a
tough response]{.underline}. Putin is running for reelection but has

#### Russia retaliates by blocking peace in the peninsula

**DePetris 17** -- MA in Political Science @ Syracuse, fellow at Defense
Priorities (Daniel, "Commentary: Why the U.S. shouldn't send arms to
Ukraine," Reuters,

To advocates who believe that sending weapons to the Ukrainian
government will bloody Russia's nose and send President Vladimir Putin a
message, this pending decision couldn't have come soon enough. [Arming
Kiev is a popular prescription]{.underline} supported by top military
officers and many lawmakers in both parties. [Popular, however, doesn't
mean smart. Opening up America's stockpile to Ukraine is not in
Washington's national security interest. In fact, it is bound to make a
conflict that is mostly frozen into a more deadly one]{.underline} [and
it complicates **any reasonable chance** of a diplomatic
resolution]{.underline}. While it may be uncomfortable to admit, the
political orientation of Ukraine and how Ukrainians choose to manage (or
mismanage) their economy and political system doesn't directly affect
the United States. As Rajan Menon and William Ruger wrote in Foreign
Affairs magazine last month, "[Ukraine matters more to Russia than it
does to the United States]{.underline}." To Washington, Ukraine is a
post-Soviet state whose oligarchic politics and systemic corruption have
severely handicapped the country's economic outlook. [U.S. security
interests in Europe are not wedded to]{.underline} whether
[Kiev]{.underline} succeeds in establishing a more democratic and
accountable form of government. At best, [Ukraine is a peripheral
country]{.underline} that the United States doesn't have a treaty
obligation to defend if its territory is invaded. [To Putin, however,
Ukraine is an integral puzzle in his grand strategy of making Russia as
relevant a global player as it was during the Cold War.]{.underline} A
wholesale Westernization of Ukrainian politics, from associations with
the European Union (EU) to a possible membership in NATO, would destroy
that ambition and ruin a significant portion of Putin's political
legacy. Indeed, the possibility of Ukraine increasing its trade
relationship and political direction with the United States and Europe
was enough of a national security threat to Putin that he was willing to
deploy Russian soldiers, paratroopers, and special forces on Ukrainian
territory to carve out a zone of influence there. Putin's belief that a
Russian-friendly Ukraine is a national security imperative for Moscow
won't be changed by a couple dozen anti-tank missiles from the United
States. The second concern for the Trump administration is how Putin
might respond to any escalation. As former National Security Council
official Charles Kupchan argued in the Washington Post: "[The notion
that Russian President Vladimir Putin would give up his hold on
Donbass]{.underline} \[Eastern Ukraine\] [if a few more Russians come
home in body bags is to dramatically misread the Kremlin]{.underline}."
Yet [this false assumption is what undergirds the arguments from
proponents of lethal assistance to the Ukrainians]{.underline}. [It's
impossible to understand why some U.S. legislators are so confident that
Moscow will react in the way they expect]{.underline}. The
three-and-a-half year long war has shown that Russia [is ruthless in
escalating its involvement and investment in the conflict]{.underline}
to prevent a military victory for Kiev. In fact, to expect that Moscow
would respond to more Russian casualties by suing for a peace settlement
is to ignore completely how Putin has behaved since Russia's 2014
invasion of Ukraine. When separatist units in Donetsk and Luhansk were
losing ground to pro-Kiev forces early in the war, Russia came to their
rescue. In the summer of 2014, when pro-Ukrainian troops were retaking
towns that Kiev previously lost, columns of Russian tanks, artillery,
heavy weapons, and soldiers crossed the border into Ukraine to ensure
that there were no more Ukrainian territorial advances in strategic
areas. When the stalemated battle in the city of Ilovaisk was slowly
moving Kiev's way, conventional Russian soldiers and weapons were
fast-tracked to the frontline in what would turn out to be one of the
deadliest days for Ukrainian troops in the war. Months later, when the
separatists were in jeopardy of retreating from the strategic town of
Delbatseve, Russian tanks were deployed and quickly forced an
undermanned, disorganized, demoralized, and tired contingent of Kiev
forces to withdraw. [There's no reason to think that Putin would respond
less violently now if Washington sent defense shipments to
Ukraine]{.underline}. The most negative impact of [additional U.S.
involvement is that it will likely spoil Moscow's willingness to
cooperate on a Ukrainian peacekeeping proposal]{.underline}. While
Moscow has insisted that the 2014 and 2015 Minsk protocols are the only
way the war in Ukraine can end peacefully, [Putin has openly
acknowledged that there may need to be greater international involvement
if]{.underline} that [peace is to be sustainable]{.underline}. [He
broached the subject of deploying U.N. troops along the contact
line]{.underline} this September [and even agreed to explore greater
access to peacekeepers in separatist-controlled territory]{.underline}
after a call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [The concept is now
being discussed within the Trump administration and between the U.S. and
Russian special envoys to the conflict, suggesting sincerity on the
Russian side]{.underline}. [A White House authorization to send
equipment to Kiev could stop that dialogue]{.underline}. [It's difficult
to understand why the United States would escalate the war when there
may finally be an opening to explore a U.N.-enforced cessation of
hostilities that could lead to a political settlement to the
conflict]{.underline}. [The Russians could respond to increased U.S.
involvement in Ukraine in other ways too]{.underline}. [Moscow
could]{.underline}, for example, use its veto power in the U.N. Security
Council to **[[block U.S.-led efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear
program]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Putin could expand military and
intelligence cooperation with Iran to undermine the Trump
administration's policy of containing Iranian expansionism. [The costs
to the U.S. of turning Ukraine into a proxy war against Russia
overshadow the benefit of increasing Moscow's casualty
count]{.underline}. [Sending arms to Kiev will do very little to help
resolve the conflict]{.underline}. Sometimes [the best course of action
for the White House is not to get more involved on issues peripheral to
American grand strategy]{.underline}.

### L - thesis of asymmetric retal

#### Standing up to Russia in Ukraine causes asymmetric retaliation in other areas that are key to US national security

**Fikenscher 14** -- Sven-Erik, "Blowback: Why Getting Tough on Russia
over Ukraine Might Backfire. When it comes to Iran and Syria, Moscow has
leverage on us---and it might not be afraid to use it.," National
Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/blowback-why-getting-tough-russia-over-ukraine-might-10474>)//BB

[Since the Russian incursion into Crimea, U.S.-Russian
relations----already shaky----have been in a downward
spiral]{.underline}. The Obama administration has voiced strong
criticism of Moscow's actions and blacklisted several officials and
individuals with close contacts to President Vladimir Putin and Bank
Rossiya. The president has recently announced that more comprehensive
sanctions might be enacted, if Russian actions undermine Ukraine's
upcoming elections. Simultaneously, however, Secretary Kerry has engaged
Russia in negotiations over reducing tensions in eastern Ukraine. To
many members of Congress and the strategic community, this approach is
too weak. The [outrage over Putin's behavior is justified and
understandable]{.underline}. Currently, pro-Russian militias in eastern
Ukraine double down on the Ukrainian security forces with Moscow's help,
leading to horrible clashes in the streets. [However, every serious
assessment of American interests must take into account that Russian
cooperation----whether one likes it or not----is required on an array of
global issues, including vital U.S. national-security
concerns]{.underline}. [The most obvious issues are Iran and
Syria]{.underline}, adversaries with nuclear ambitions in one case
(Iran) and chemical weapons in the other (Syria). Although Washington
and Moscow agree that Tehran must be kept from having nuclear weapons,
disagreement lingers over the means to achieve this goal. Russia is
traditionally skeptical of imposing sanctions on other states and it
took quite an effort to get Putin's thumbs-up for the comprehensive
sanctions regime currently in place. With respect to Syria, things are
even more complex. Washington wants Assad to leave, whereas Moscow is
still supporting him and his regime. It was Obama's declaration to carry
out air strikes that forced Putin's hand. The latter eventually
pressured Assad to give up his chemical arsenal in exchange for military
restraint on the part of the U.S. Now [the challenge is to
maintain]{.underline} that level of [unity in difficult
times]{.underline}. [Tehran and Damascus might be emboldened by any move
that signaled Russian willingness to weaken pressure]{.underline}.
Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei A. Ryabkov already alluded to
the option of taking "retaliatory measures" against the West in the Iran
context, "if they force us into that." There is no shortage of
opportunities to turn words into actions. For example, Moscow and Tehran
are presently in talks over a so-called oil-for-goods program, under
which Iran would import Russian goods and equipment worth up to \$20
billion in exchange for 500,000 barrels of oil per day. [Another key
issue for Washington is nuclear security. Since nuclear material is
still fairly vulnerable in many places in Russia, and the United States
is the most likely target of nuclear terrorism, the adequate protection
of fissile and radiological material in Russia should be a
priority]{.underline} for the United States. Against this backdrop, the
Department of Energy's recent decision to retract a funding request to
allocate money for Russian response forces in charge of defending
nuclear material was very unwise. It is not without irony that the
decision to shelve a cooperative measure in which the United States has
a key interest was not a retaliatory move on the part of Russia, but
rather, on the part of Washington. This shows that the danger of no
longer getting priorities straight is a real one. It may sound cynical
to most observers, but Putin's actions in Ukraine have affected American
values, not American interests. From a selfish perspective, current
events in Ukraine are a sideshow compared to Iran, Syria, and nuclear
security. [Washington needs to make a decision about its foreign-policy
priorities, if tensions in eastern Ukraine are not reduced. Giving the
events in Ukraine priority over all other international developments is
a hazardous strategy. Negotiations have gotten us nowhere, and way more
assertive steps against Russia are not likely to make Putin give in,
since he seems to be determined not to lose his influence over eastern
Ukraine and eager to demonstrate Russia's power]{.underline}.
Furthermore[, a **much tougher stance on Russia might backfire easily**,
since Moscow might react by undermining fundamental American
national-security interests]{.underline}. [The dual approach of enacting
targeted sanctions]{.underline} against Russia on the one hand [and
engaging Moscow]{.underline} on the other [is messy]{.underline} and
troublesome. And [yet]{.underline}, [there is no better
alternative]{.underline} for the time being.

#### It undermines diplomacy in [other areas]{.underline}

**Ashford 15** -- PhD in Foreign Affairs @ UVA (Emma, "No, This Is Not
another Cold War," OCR,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/no-not-another-cold-war)//BB>

[Treating the Ukraine crisis as the introduction to a new Cold War owes
much to the fact that peoples' views of new conflicts are informed by
their understanding of prior conflicts]{.underline}. [Political science
research demonstrates that leaders often rationalize their decisions by
making analogies to prior crises]{.underline}. Policymakers also
frequently use historical analogies to justify their choices. This
tendency is alive and well today. British Prime Minister David Cameron
drew such an allusion in September, reportedly telling European leaders
that they "run the risk of repeating the mistakes made in Munich in
'38." A number of other European and U.S. policymakers have drawn
similar parallels. Thus [policymakers]{.underline}, many of
[who]{.underline}m [lived through the late Cold War period, are likely
to see the conflict through that lens]{.underline}, [recasting Russia as
the 'old enemy' and viewing the current crisis as an existential threat,
even when it **doesn't come close**]{.underline}. The Ukraine Freedom
Support Act, recently signed into law, is a case in point. Although the
stated purpose of the legislation is to provide support to Ukraine, the
bill broadens sanctions on Russia to include other issues. In addition
to permitting the president to arm Ukraine, it directs the president to
hold Russia accountable for violations of the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces treaty and to sanction any Russian company found to be selling
weapons to Syria's government. Neither issue has any bearing on Russia's
conduct in Ukraine and their inclusion in this bill has the potential to
undermine diplomatic progress on these issues by tying them to the
quagmire in Ukraine. [The more we rehash Cold War-era ideas, the more
likely we are to end up in a similar standoff. Containment,]{.underline}
for example, [is being continually put forth as a solution to the
situation in Ukraine.]{.underline} [Far from a shrewd strategic vision,
this mindset exemplifies the obtuse U.S. approach toward Russia, which
has no clear goal other than forcing Moscow to back down. Russia's
complete capitulation is improbable]{.underline}, yet the possibility of
a negotiated solution to the Ukraine crisis remains mostly unconsidered.
It is unlikely that Russia and the West will be able to achieve a
productive and cooperative relationship in the near future, even if the
Ukraine crisis is solved. But [relying on Cold War analogies is
self-defeating, limiting our policy options and **preventing
constructive diplomacy in other areas of U.S.-Russian
relations**]{.underline}.

2\) Russia matters more than Ukraine to America.

[Moscow's policy in Ukraine is about Ukraine, not the U.S.]{.underline}
If Russia really wanted to be America's number one enemy, as claimed by
Mitt Romney, then Russia would have directly challenged America. It has
not. However, [Moscow can cause significant trouble for Washington in a
**number of areas**. And treating Russia as an enemy risks turning it
into one]{.underline}. [For instance]{.underline}, in mid-December [the
Putin government ended the U.S.-funded nuclear security
program]{.underline}, [which helped prevent loose nukes after the
break-up of the Soviet Union]{.underline}. In January Russia signed an
agreement with Iran for expanded defense cooperation, reportedly
including long-delayed delivery of the S300 missile air defense system.
This weapon could greatly complicate plans for an American or Israeli
military strike on Iran. [This might be just the start. The Putin
government could arm Syria]{.underline} with advanced missiles, [defend
Tehran against American and European pressure over its nuclear program,
impede U.S. logistical operations in Afghanistan, provide advanced arms
to North Korea]{.underline}, [and transfer military technologies to
China]{.underline}. Worse, Russia is pursuing a closer relationship with
China; should that evolve into a serious anti-American axis, despite
serious differences between the two states, much harm could result.

#### Russia has [unique leverage]{.underline} over North Korea

. [Moscow saw an opportunity to heighten Russia's international
influence and prestige by reinserting itself into Korean Peninsula
politics through restoring links with the DPRK. The Putin administration
judged -- correctly -- that rebuilding ties with Pyongyang, while
preserving good relations with Seoul, would again make Russia **a player
to be reckoned with** in Northeast Asia.]{.underline} The new policy
manifested itself in the highest level visits. Putin went to Pyongyang
in 2000, becoming the first Russian leader to visit North Korea, while
Kim Jong-il traveled to Russia in 2001, 2002 and 2011. In 2003 Russia
also became the founding member of the Six Party Talks, reportedly at
the insistence of Pyongyang, thus institutionalizing and legitimizing
Moscow's role on the Korean Peninsula. [During that period Russia was
careful to pursue equidistance -- or equal closeness -- in political
relations with Seoul and Pyongyang]{.underline}. Recognizing the South's
concerns about the North's development of nuclear and ballistic weapons
and disapproving of Pyongyang's provocative statements and actions,
[Moscow simultaneously pointed to the need to safeguard the DPRK's
"legitimate" security interests. Russia supported the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) sanctions punishing North Korea for its nuclear
and ballistic missile program, but Moscow, along with Beijing, worked to
take the edge off the sanctions and opposed harsher measures backed by
the United States and Japan.\[]{.underline}6\] [**The Ukraine crisis**,
that started to unfold in 2013 and culminated in 2014, **profoundly
transformed Russia's foreign policy**. The competition with the United
States that hitherto had been tempered by a significant amount of
bilateral engagement and cooperation turned into **bitter enmity**. This
has had **considerable repercussions** for Russia's approaches to the
**Korean Peninsula**, visible in the rapid improvement of Russia-North
Korea ties]{.underline}. [During 2014 and 2015, Russian-North Korean
relations have remarkably grown in intensity]{.underline}. There has
been a flurry of high-level exchanges, with Russia becoming the country
most frequently visited by North Korean senior officials. Since February
2014, the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly Presidium Chairman Kim
Yong-nam, Minister of Foreign Trade Lee Ren-Nam, Foreign Minister Lee
Soo-Young, Kim Jong-un's special envoy Choe Ryong Hae, Supreme People\`s
Assembly Chairman Choi Thae Baek and other senior leaders traveled
Russia.\[7\] Russia reciprocated by sending to Pyongyang multiple
delegations. Although the expected visit of the DPRK's supreme leader
Kim Jong-un to Moscow for the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of
victory over Nazi Germany did not materialize (Pyongyang was instead
represented by Kim Yong-nam, the number two in the DPRK state
hierarchy), this did not slow the momentum of Russia-North Korea ties,
with 2015 designated as the Year of Friendship of Russia and the DPRK.
In November 2015, Moscow and Pyongyang signed an agreement on
"preventing dangerous military activity." The agreement, concluded at
the level of the two countries' general staffs, was an indication of
increased military contacts between Russia and the DPRK.\[8\] In
February 2016, Moscow and Pyongyang concluded an agreement on the
transfer of illegal migrants, which will facilitate the deportation of
North Korean defectors back to the DPRK.\[9\] This sensitive document
was signed just a few weeks after the North's nuclear test and a few
days before the planned long-range missile launch, suggesting that, even
under such inauspicious circumstances, [Russia was keen to pursue
political cooperation with the North Korean regime. On the economic
front, too, there have been a number of significant developments. The
issue of North Korea's debt to Russia (inherited from the Soviet era)
was finally settled in May 2014, with Russia agreeing to write off 90%
of the \$11 billion debt.]{.underline} In order to promote bilateral
commerce, the Russian-North Korean Business Council was set up, while
North Korea agreed to relax visa regulations for Russian businesspeople
and facilitate their work activities in the DPRK. Russia and the DPRK
have made steps to use rubles in their commercial transactions.\[10\]
[Apart from facilitating bilateral trade, the shift to rubles may help
reduce North Korea's vulnerability to the US financial sanctions that
target dollar-denominated transactions]{.underline}.\[11\] Tentative
agreements on several large-scale projects have been reached. The
biggest among them, named "Pobeda" ("Victory"), calls for Russia to make
substantial investments, to the tune of \$25 billion over 20 years, in
North Korea's mining industry and industrial infrastructure in exchange
for gaining privileged access to the DPRK's mineral wealth. Negotiations
are underway to lease vast tracts of agricultural land in the RFE for
North Koreans to cultivate. These and other developments indicate that
Russia-North Korea ties are now at their highest point since the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Both being ostracized by the West and
subjected to sanctions, Russia and the DPRK now evidently feel more
empathy with each other. In particular, North Korea expressed support
for Russia over Crimea. In turn, Moscow defended the DPRK at the UNSC
when it voted, along with China, against the inclusion of the issue of
human rights in North Korea on the UNSC agenda.\[12\] [Moscow also
probably wants to use its increased support for North Korea as
additional leverage in the dealings with the West, Seoul and Tokyo,
while **North Korea needs Russia** to reduce its extreme dependence on
China]{.underline}. Russia and China: Exchanging Korea for Ukraine?
Moscow has always stressed the need to seek "peaceful political and
diplomatic solutions" to the North Korean issue. In effect, this means
conservation of the existing geopolitical realities and preservation of
the DPRK as a sovereign entity. Nonetheless, until recently Moscow's
commitment to Pyongyang was not without serious reservations. It seemed
quite likely that Moscow would at some point judge that continuation of
the erratic North Korean regime was not in its interests, leading to
Russian acceptance of a swift Korean reunification, even if it should
have been carried out as absorption of the North by South Korea. Even if
US troops were to be stationed in the northern part of the Peninsula
after reunification, they would be of much more concern to China than
Russia, if only because China shares a much longer border with North
Korea (China's frontier with North Korea is 1,416 kilometers long while
Russia's is only 19 kilometers). Unlike Beijing, the Kremlin did not
worry much about the prospect of North Korea disappearing from the
political map since Pyongyang served as a protective buffer for China
rather than Russia.\[13\] One also had to consider the economic gains
that Russia was well positioned to reap as a result of Korean
reunification. Major projects that were stalled due to the inter-Korean
conflict, such as a gas pipeline from Russia to Korea and the linking of
Korean railways to the Russian Trans-Siberian Railway, would go ahead if
the North Korean problem was finally resolved. More generally, North
Korea is basically an economic wasteland, with very little commercial
opportunities for the neighboring Russian Far East. To make things
worse, the DPRK separates Russia from the powerhouse of the South Korean
economy. Korean reunification would give the RFE direct access to a
single market of 75 million people with high demand for Russian
commodities. Moscow was, and remains, unhappy with North Korea's steady
progress in the development of nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles
both for reasons of principle, Russia being one of the guarantors of the
NPT regime, and out of security concerns. Pyongyang's nuclear
aspirations pose immediate safety and security risks to the RFE and, in
the longer term, could result in an arms race in Northeast Asia, a
scenario extremely undesirable for Russia. Russia's preferred
geopolitical vision for Northeast Asia has been one of rules-based
multi-polar balance of power -- a concert or powers in which Moscow
would be one of the participants, with the Six Party Talks as a possible
institutional prototype for such an arrangement. [Prior to the Ukraine
crisis, a unified Korea, with reduced security dependence on Washington
and more clout vis-à-vis Beijing and Tokyo, was seen by many in Moscow
as instrumental in establishing a power equilibrium in Northeast Asia
that would be resistant to the dominance of any single actor, be it the
United States or China]{.underline}. That constituted one more reason
for Russia's potential interest in Korean reunification. Perhaps even a
unified Korea that retained some form of security ties with the United
States could have been acceptable to Moscow, as long as Russia's
relations with Washington were reasonably tolerable -- just the way they
stood in the 2000s. This contrasted with China's stance: Beijing
obviously preferred to keep Korea divided rather than seeing a united,
strong and possibly pro-US country on China's borders, unless, of
course, a unified Korea recognized itself as part of the Chinese
strategic sphere of influence, a very unlikely prospect. [Russia's
mounting conflict with the West that culminated in the Ukraine crisis
changed Moscow's calculus. First, the Ukraine mess has distracted
Russia's attention and resources from East Asia, including the Korean
Peninsula. Second, emotional anti-Americanism has permeated Russian
foreign policy, making Washington's enemies Moscow's friends and
poisoning Russia's relations with US allies like South Korea and Japan.
Third, and perhaps most important, Russia's growing reliance on China is
making Russia more receptive to Beijing's interests in the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}. To be sure, the Asia-Pacific, and especially
the Korean Peninsula, is important to Moscow in many respects but its
significance cannot be compared to Russian stakes in Ukraine and other
post-Soviet regions -- the places Russia is literally prepared to fight
for. At the same time, China has fundamental interests in the Korean
Peninsula and views Eastern Europe as a peripheral concern. This makes
possible, and logical, a sort of geopolitical deal-making between Moscow
and Beijing, with Russia showing deference to Beijing in East Asian
affairs in return for China's tacit support, or at least benevolent
neutrality, in the Kremlin's confrontation with the US-led West over
Ukraine. One indication of Russia's growing strategic collaboration with
China on the Peninsula issue has been the two countries' joint
opposition to the THAAD missile defense system's prospective deployment
in South Korea. In April 2015, Russia and China held the first round of
the bilateral dialogue on security in Northeast Asia in which the THAAD
issue was one of the main agenda items.\[14\] [It may be expected that
Moscow and Beijing will increasingly coordinate their positions on
security issues in Northeast Asia and the Peninsula, including the
provision **of diplomatic cover for the North Korean
regime.**]{.underline} This will resurrect a Cold War-era division of
Northeast Asia into the US-Japan-ROK trio versus the China-Russia-DPRK
axis.\[15\] [The true importance of Sino-Russian collaboration on the
Penisula may be revealed in case of a North Korean
implosion]{.underline}. Although the collapse of the DPRK's current
regime is by no means imminent, the situation in the North is basically
unpredictable. The regime may continue for another fifty years, but it
is almost as likely that it will start falling apart tomorrow. The two
players that would have the highest stakes in the event of a North
Korean implosion are obviously the ROK and China. They will seek to
control the process of the regime's collapse and shape its outcome in
order to secure their own interests in the northern part of the
Peninsula. Even though China admittedly has a substantial leverage over
North Korea, it may need Russian backing, if and when the DPRK begins to
crumble. Apart from China and the ROK, Russia is the only country
neighboring North Korea. Moreover, unlike the DMZ, Russia's border with
the North is not heavily militarized. This could make it easier for
Russia to intervene, jointly with China, in the DPRK. Russia's rich
experience in carrying out military and hybrid warfare operations in
recent years -- from Chechnya to Crimea -- will certainly be an extra
asset for China that has not tested its armed force since 1979 (when it
launched an offensive against Vietnam). Putin's bold intervention in
Syria underscored Russia's increased willingness -- and capacity -- to
undertake military gambles in foreign countries. Last but not least,
Russia's diplomatic support as a major power and permanent UNSC member
will give more international legitimacy to the intervention, allowing
Beijing to avoid isolation. Swift coordinated actions by China and
Russia will guarantee that the outcome of a North Korean contingency
will be in accordance with their geopolitical interests. Beijing would
aim for the stabilization of the North and installment of a new regime
loyal to China while preventing the absorption of the DPRK by the
US-allied South. Russia will back Beijing's game, especially if China
allows Moscow to retain some degree of influence over North Korea. If
China and Russia act in lockstep in a North Korean crisis, Seoul's
chances to achieve reunification with the North on its own terms are
reduced to near zero. [What is Russia's Leverage with North Korea? The
conventional view is that Russia's influence over North Korea is mostly
political, predicated on Russia's permanent membership in the UNSC and
participation in the Six Party Talks.]{.underline} [Often overlooked is
the fact that Russia maintains **a range of commercial and other links**
with the DPRK.]{.underline} [Taken together, they constitute quite a
**substantial leverage** that Russia can exercise over North Korea, when
and if it chooses to do so]{.underline}. Arguably, among North Korea's
neighbors Russia now ranks second, after China, in terms of its
potential capability to cause intense economic pain to the North Korean
regime. This became especially true in recent years after Japan and
South Korea discontinued virtually all economic contacts with the DPRK.
[**Trade**. In 2014, Russia's trade with North Korea totaled \$92
million, with Russian exports accounting for 90% of the
turnover]{.underline}. Russia ranks as the DPRK's third biggest partner
in terms of imports. This, to a large extent, reflects the reality that
North Korea has to offer mostly raw materials, like coal and iron ore,
that Russia itself has in abundance. The top items that Russia sells to
the North are oil and fuel, transport vehicles, and grain[. Moreover,
according to minister for the development of the Far East Alexander
Galushka, about one third of China's exports to North Korea (roughly
\$900 mln) is actually made up of Russian-originated
goods]{.underline}.\[16\] He did not specify which Russian goods China
re-exports to North Korea, but this is most likely oil. Galushka
suggested that the involvement of "third countries" in Russia-North
Korea commerce should be minimized in order to reduce the prices and
raise the quality of the traded merchandise. [**North Korean labor**.
The imbalance in trade in goods, in which Russia has an overwhelming
surplus, is partly compensated by the export of North Korean labor to
Russia]{.underline}. [Sending labor overseas is an **important source of
hard currency** for the North Korean regime. The North Korean government
takes at least **50 percent** of what its workers earn in foreign
countries]{.underline}. North Korean guest workers first came to the
Russian (then -- Soviet) Far East in the late 1940s under
inter-governmental agreements. There has long been a natural
complementarity between the RFE's constant shortage of manpower and
North Korea's surplus labor. [Varying from year to year, there are
approximately 20-26 thousand North Korean migrants in Russia, most of
them contract guest laborers. According to some estimates, Russia is the
world's biggest recipient of North Korean contract
labor.\[17\]]{.underline} Labor migrants from the DPRK are mostly males,
involved in construction, agriculture and timbering. Most North Korean
workers enter Russia under a contract with a Russian company, which acts
as their formal employer. However, they often end up on the free job
market. For example, in Vladivostok most of North Koreans find jobs in
construction, renovating apartments and houses etc. They are organized
in teams led by "captains." The captains are persons who have lived in
Russia for a relatively long time, can speak Russian and are familiar
with the local market. Teams are responsible for finding their
employment. In fact, they act as free market agents -- looking for jobs
and offering their services, which they often advertise in local mass
media.\[18\] In Vladivostok, North Korean construction and renovation
teams are highly competitive, offering a very attractive price-quality
tradeoff. One can often see large groups of North Koreans in the
Vladivostok airport boarding Air Koryo flights back to Pyongyang. Most
of them carry a lot of baggage, indicating that they bring commercial
stuff from Russia to be resold in North Korea, thus acting as another
informal conduit for Russian-North Korean trade. The North Korean
migrants are considered law-abiding and do not give much trouble to the
authorities in the RFE. Back in the 1990s, there were several cases of
North Koreans engaged in currency counterfeiting and drugs trafficking,
but this problem does not exist any more.\[19\] One peculiar fixture of
North Korea's presence in Russia is its restaurants. There are North
Korean restaurants in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and Moscow. They are part
North Korea's global network of state-run restaurants, not only earning
money for the government in Pyongyang but also apparently serving as
sites of intelligence operations.\[20\] [**Investment**. The bulk of
Russia's direct investment in North Korea is related to the Khasan-Rajin
project. The state-owned Russian Railways spent roughly \$300 mln on the
upgrade of the 54-kilometer cross-border railway link from Russia's
Khasan to the North Korean port of Rajin.]{.underline} [This was
accompanied with the modernization of the Rajin port facilities, where
Russia was granted a long-term lease of one of the piers]{.underline}.
To implement the project, a joint venture, Rasonkontrans, was
established, with Russia holding 70% of the shares and North Korea 30%.
Apart from the South Korean-funded Kaesong industrial complex, the
Khasan-Rajin venture may well be the largest single foreign investment
in North Korea. The upgraded railway, which became operational in 2013,
allows the use of the port of Rajin for transshipment of cargos coming
via the Trans-Siberian from Russia bound for Asia-Pacific countries. So
far the cargos coming via the Khasan-Rajin route have mainly been
destined for China. In 2014-2015, there were three successful shipments
of Siberian coal via Rajin to South Korea's Pohang, raising hopes that
the route can be eventually used as another inter-Korean business
project. Russia views the Khasan-Rajin project as the first stage of the
grand design to link up the Russian Trans-Siberian mainline with the
prospective Trans-Korean Railway. [Finance. Russia is one of the few
countries whose financial institutions carry out regular transactions
with North Korea. These are mostly private banks located in the
RFE.]{.underline} Tellingly, in 2007 the RFE's Khabarovsk-based
Dalcombank became the only bank in the world that agreed to perform a
delicate mission of mediating the transfer to North Korea of \$25 mln of
the Kim regime's assets that had been previously frozen in Macao-based
Banco Delta Asia by the US financial sanctions.\[21\] [Fishing. Russia's
exclusive economic zone is an important source of fish catches for North
Korea.]{.underline} North Korean fishing boats, mostly catching squid,
operate in Russian waters in accordance with intergovernmental
agreements between Russia and the DPRK that regulate the species and the
amount allowed for catch. Apart from legal fishing, there have been
repeated incidents of North Korean poaching in Russia's seas, even
though Russian authorities are generally reluctant to make them public.
[**Aircraft**. North Korean national flag carrier Air Koryo's fleet
entirely consists of Russian-made aircraft -- Tupolevs, Ilyushins, and
Antonovs. This means dependence on spare parts and some maintenance
services imported from Russia]{.underline}. [The DPRK's air force also
operates a large number of Soviet- and Russian-made jets, though most of
them are grounded due to shortages of fuel and poor maintenance.
Transportation links.]{.underline} With the exception of China, Russia
is the only country that maintains overland transportation
communications with the DPRK. Russia and North Korea are connected by a
railway bridge across Tumangan (Tumannaya) River. In addition to the
existing railway link, the two sides recently decided to build an
automobile bridge, although it is unclear when the construction will
actually begin.\[22\] Russia's Vladivostok is among the handful of
airports that have permanent scheduled air service to Pyongyang\[23\]
(all the other airports with scheduled year-round service to North Korea
are China's Beijing, Shenyang and Shanghai).\[24\] Regular overland and
air links make Russia an indispensable gateway for North Korea. If
Russia curtails or terminates the functioning of these routes, North
Korea will only have to rely on Chinese options. [Education. Russia is
one of the very few countries where North Korea sends its students, even
though their number is relatively limited]{.underline}.

RM: Let's start by "zooming out": [There's been plenty of
debate]{.underline} in the pundit class [about responses to North
Korea's latest tests related to nuclear weapons]{.underline}. What are
the main reasonable lines of thought in the U.S. policymaking
establishment about what should be done? How close is this establishment
to consensus? GS: I think there is general agreement that [eliminating
North Korea's nuclear weapons is not a realistic goal]{.underline} for
the time being, perhaps as long as the Kim dynasty rules in Pyongyang.
[Military options]{.underline} to destroy North Korea's nuclear weapons
and missile force [are impractical and run a high risk of sparking a
broader conflict]{.underline}, which would be very costly and dangerous
to the U.S. and its Asian allies. Regime change is not possible without
Chinese cooperation and Beijing is deeply reluctant to apply economic
pressures that could destabilize North Korea. [Hence,
diplomacy]{.underline} (backed by sanctions) [is the only
option]{.underline} to limit and delay North Korea's nuclear and missile
programs in the near term, even though it will not result in
denuclearization. Because prospects for diplomacy are so uncertain,
there is general agreement in Washington on the need to enhance military
cooperation with South Korea and Japan to strengthen deterrence and
defense, including missile defense. RM: Is Russia critical to this
effort? Does it, for example, have sufficient leverage vis-à-vis North
Korea to convince it to abandon or freeze its nuclear or missile
program? GS: Compared to the U.S. and China, Russia is a relatively
secondary player because it has little leverage with North Korea since
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of large-scale aid and
military assistance to Pyongyang. Nonetheless, [Russian cooperation is
**necessary** to make the diplomatic option effective]{.underline}. In
particular, [**Moscow can play the spoiler** and reduce pressure on
North Korea to negotiate if it blocks U.N. Security Council sanctions
resolutions or expands trade with North Korea to replace trade between
North Korea and China.]{.underline}

**Talmadge 5/10** (Eric Talmadge was the Pyongyang bureau chief for The
AP, 5-10-2019, \"Experts see Russia fingerprints on North Korea\'s new
missile,\" AP NEWS,
https://www.apnews.com/20afeea785634442b8300ba2fab0c002)//ssl

TOKYO (AP) [--- The three new missiles North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
has tested over the past week are eerily familiar to military experts:
They look just like a controversial and widely copied missile the
Russian military has deployed to Syria and has been actively trying to
sell abroad for years.]{.underline} Ending a pause in ballistic missile
launches that began in late 2017, and alarming North Korea's neighbors,
Kim personally supervised the launch of the first missile from the
country's east coast on Saturday and two more from the west on Thursday.
All splashed down in the Pacific. The missiles were short-range and the
launches do not mean Kim has decided to end his self-imposed moratorium
on testing long-range missiles that could reach the United States
mainland[. They do indicate, however, that Kim is methodically expanding
the battle readiness of his missile forces and that could have a major
impact on the safety of American allies and U.S. forces in the
region.]{.underline} [The missiles bear a strong resemblance to the
Russian-designed Iskander, a short-range, **nuclear-capable** ballistic
missile that has been in the Russian arsenal for more than a
decade.]{.underline} "There are Russian technology fingerprints all over
it," said Marcus Schiller, a leading expert on North Korean missiles who
is based in Germany. [He added that short of actually procuring the
missiles from Russia, the North could have had key parts delivered from
somewhere else, perhaps not directly from Russia, while making
components such as the outer shell, or airframe, domestically. **The
Iskander**, or something like it, **would be of particular interest to
North Korea.**]{.underline} [It's designed to fly at a flattened-out
altitude of around 40 kilometers (25 miles) and to make in-flight
guidance adjustments. Both **capabilities exploit weaknesses** in the
U.S. and South Korean **missile defenses** that are now in place,
primarily Patriot missile batteries and the THAAD anti-missile defense
system.]{.underline} The Iskander is also quicker to launch, and thus
harder to destroy on the ground, because of its solid fuel engine and
more accurate because of its advanced guidance system. Despite claims by
senior members of the Trump administration that the missiles aren't a
threat to the United States, in a battle scenario they would likely be
used to attack targets well behind the front-lines, such as the U.S.
military bases in South Korea. There are roughly 28,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea and tens of thousands more family members and
civilian Department of Defense employees. [The North first displayed a
mock-up of an Iskander-like missile at a military parade in
2018.]{.underline} This week's launches mark its first known flight
tests. [Michael Elleman, director of the Nonproliferation and Nuclear
Policy Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies,
said further analysis of the missiles' performance]{.underline} will
provide clues as to whether it was produced by Russia. ["If its flight
path and accuracy were marginal or inconsistent with known Iskander
trajectories and performance, then I think some form of local
development with **external technical assistance is more likely**," he
said. "The key here is that one cannot make a new system **without
undertaking certain development steps.** I have seen no evidence of such
activity."]{.underline} Initial reports suggested at least one of the
tests did involve an Iskander-like trajectory. The Iskander missile
system has been part of the Russian arsenal since 2006. The Iskander-M
version used by the Russian military is more than 7 meters (yards) long,
can weigh more than 4,000 kilograms (9,000 pounds) and has a range of
about 400 to 500 kilometers (250 to 310 miles). Russia first tested the
Iskander in combat in 2008, against Georgia. The Iskander missiles have
long been a source of tension in Europe and were cited by President
Donald Trump as a key reason behind his decision in February to break
with the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which bans
production, testing and deployment of land-based cruise and ballistic
missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles).
Such missiles only take a few minutes to reach their targets, leaving no
time for decision-makers and raising the likelihood of a global nuclear
conflict over a false launch warning. Moscow claims the Iskander-M's
range is just below the operational limit and should not be considered a
treaty violation. [From the start, **Russia has seen the Iskander
missile as a potential export**]{.underline}. To avoid running afoul of
international non-proliferation restrictions, Russia produces a
less-formidable version that has a reduced range and is designed to
carry a smaller payload for sales abroad. So far, it has sold that
missile --- called Iskander-E --- to Algeria and Armenia. It has
reportedly discussed exports to Iran, Libya, the United Arab Emirates,
Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. According to Siemon Wezeman, a senior
researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,
which tracks the global arms trade, Russia has used the Iskander missile
in Syria. He said Syria has expressed interest in buying its own
Iskanders, but Russia has declined. Wezeman stressed Russia cannot
legally sell Iskanders of any variety to North Korea. A United Nations
embargo in place since 2006, when the North conducted its first nuclear
test, prohibits supplying the North with major arms, including
ground-to-ground missiles, and U.N. sanctions prohibit the transfer of
ballistic missiles and related technology. [If North Korea is producing
an Iskander clone, it would not be the first country to do
so.]{.underline} South Korea has what many believe is its own
Iskander-inspired missile --- the Hyunmoo-2. China also has a similar
missile, called the DF-12 or M20 that was also configured with exports
in mind. One of its buyers, Qatar, put them on display at a parade in
2017.

[North Korea's acquisition of an advanced tactical ballistic missile
closely resembling the **Russian** **Iskander** has serious implications
for the United States and its allies - both on the Korean Peninsula and
beyond]{.underline}. While the missile's deployment on the Korean
Peninsula is highly unlikely, with all parties deterred from potential
military action by one another's nuclear assets, [North Korea is likely
to **proliferate these ballistic missiles to third parties** -
particularly those in the Middle East which have been longstanding
clients for previous tactical systems. **Iran and Syria** are two of the
most obvious clients for the platform, with both continuing to receive
newer and more capable Korean weapons systems]{.underline} such as the
Musudan ballistic missile which was deployed by Iran from 2017 as the
Khorramshahr - the most capable ballistic missile in its inventory. T[he
missile forces of both these countries rely overwhelmingly on Korean
technologies, and a platform with capabilities comparable to the
Iskander - a system Russia is unlikely to supply either party - could be
a game changer for their strike capabilities. Deployed to Syria, or by
the Iranian armed and Korean trained Hezbollah militia in Southern
Lebanon, the missiles would pose a major threat to Israeli military
facilities such as airbases and command centres]{.underline}. Wi[th a
minimal range extension over the original Iskander, the missile in
Iranian hands could also pose a major threat to U.S. and other Western
military facilities in Arab gulf states - while also placing oil fields
and high value Arab targets such as oil fields and desalination plants
in the firing line]{.underline}. U.S. efforts to restrict Egyptian
access to advanced arms, most recently through threats of economic
sanctions, could also be undermined through potential purchases of the
new Iskander-like missile - which could also see Cairo attempt to set up
licensed production lines domestically as it did in the 1990s for the
Rodong-1 and Hwasong-6 platforms. [The result of North Korea\'s
acquisition of this missile, therefore, is likely to be the empowerment
of U.S. adversaries both on the Korean Peninsula and beyond by serious
enhancement to their strike capabilitie]{.underline}s.

[North Korea's second missile test on Thursday signals it is serious
about developing new, short-range weapons that could be used early and
effectively in any war with South Korea and the United
States,]{.underline} analysts studying images of the latest launches
say. [Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the first
flight of a previously untested weapon - a relatively small, fast
missile experts believe will be easier to hide, launch, and maneuver in
flight.]{.underline} Photos released by state media on Friday showed
Thursday's test involved the same weapon. The tests have increased
tensions after the last U.S.-North Korea summit collapsed in February in
Hanoi with no agreement over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic
missile program. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said late on
Thursday the launches seemed like a protest over the failed summit,
while North Korea has defended the tests as routine and self defensive.
Some analysts say the multiple tests show the missiles aren't only for
political show. "This second test solidifies that these launches are not
just to stir the pot and elicit a U.S. response to resume negotiations,"
[said Grace Liu, one of a team of missile experts at the James Martin
Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) in California. "They are
developing a reliable, operable missile that can defeat missile defenses
and conduct a precision strike in South Korea."]{.underline} DEFEATING
MISSILE DEFENSES The U.S. and South Korean responses to the launches
have been muted, with U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials
emphasizing the missiles are not the large, intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the United States. [But analysts
said the military applications of the new missiles should not be
underestimated. "The Trump administration keeps downplaying these
missiles because they are not ICBMs, but even though they can't reach
the U.S. mainland, **it's missiles like these that will start the
war,"** said Melissa Hanham, a weapons expert at Datayo, which tracks
international security threats]{.underline}. ["They are small, easy to
hide, easy to maneuver and **you can't tell what kind of warhead** they
are carrying. **They could carry a nuclear weapon**." In a preliminary
report on Wednesday, the North Korea tracking website 38 North said the
new missile looks similar to Russia's SS-26 Iskander missile, and could
exploit gaps in South Korean and American missile defense
coverage]{.underline}. The United States and South Korea field Patriot
and THAAD missile batteries designed to shoot down various ballistic and
cruise missiles, but their capabilities have been disputed. While the
origin of the North Korean missile remains unclear, a team of analysts
at CNS told Reuters that Thursday's test confirmed the missile is
capable of maneuvering to elude defenses and protect its launch crew
from detection. "You can tell from the low apogee that this missile
maneuvers a bit in boost to defeat missile defenses and aircraft hunting
the launcher," said Jeffrey Lewis of CNS. Michael Duitsman, a rocket
propulsion expert with the team, said North Korean state media photos of
the launch show likely thrust vanes and steerable fins that guide the
missile with precision and allow it to maneuver through much of its
flight. While Saturday's missile was fired from a transporter erector
launcher (TEL) vehicle with wheels, Thursday's test featured a tracked
vehicle. Use of a tracked vehicle, which North Korea has more experience
building, suggests it may plan to deploy a large number of the missiles
and launchers, said Joshua Pollack, editor of The Nonproliferation
Review. "This seems to be their only mass-production option for highly
capable TELs at the moment," he said. [The missile uses solid fuel,
which allows the weapon to be easily moved and fired more quickly than
those using liquid fuel, analysts said. In the end, the new missiles add
a **new level of unpredictability** to an already tense situation,
Hanham said. "If North Korea pulls out (an ICBM) everyone knows it'll be
launched with a nuke," she said. "These little missiles **you don't
know**, so it's hard to be prepared."]{.underline}

#### Russia asymmetrically retaliates with intrusions into the Baltics

**Stratfor 18** ("A U.S.-Ukraine Weapons Deal Has Russia Up in Arms,"
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/us-ukraine-weapons-deal-has-russia-arms)//BB>

[Since the war in Ukraine began]{.underline} in 2014, [the United States
has considered sending arms to the country]{.underline}. Now Washington
is ready to follow through with the idea. U.S. President Donald Trump
approved the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine on Dec. 22, signing a
\$47 million deal that includes 35 FGM-148 Javelin command launch units
and 210 anti-tank missiles, along with smaller arms. Wary of provoking
Russia, the United States has been careful to frame the recent decision
as a purely defensive measure, and not a means to encourage military
action against separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. But [Moscow,
viewing the move as an act of escalation, will doubtless
respond]{.underline} in one way or another. A Cautious Move Though the
previous administration also entertained sending arms to Ukraine, it
chose not to take that route to avoid stoking the conflict, which had
become less intense in 2015. Trump signaled on taking office that he
would take a similar approach. He preferred to work with Russia on
issues such as the war in Ukraine, rather than ratchet up tension. Over
the first year of Trump\'s presidency, however, relations between
Washington and Moscow have only declined. Congress passed stricter
sanctions against Russia in 2017 and may impose more punitive measures
on the country this year. At the same time, officials in the Trump
administration, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, National
Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt
Volker, advocated more firmly for supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine.
Even so, the administration has tread lightly on the issue. An unnamed
U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal that the Javelin missiles
promised in the arms deal would be used only for training purposes in
western Ukraine --- far from the front lines --- under the close watch
of U.S. military personnel. That way, Washington hopes not only to avoid
a flare-up in the fighting but also to make sure its weapons don\'t wind
up in the hands of the separatists and their Russian patrons. Firing
Back Moscow isn\'t convinced, though. Following the arms deal\'s
announcement, the Russian deputy foreign minister called the United
States \"an accomplice in fueling a war\" because of the decision. And
that accusation may not be the extent of Russia\'s reaction. Moscow, for
example, could respond to the move in kind by ramping up its support for
the separatists in Donbas to ensure they have capabilities on par with
those of the Ukrainian military. On Jan. 10, a member of the Ukrainian
parliament said the Russian military was working on technology to shield
vehicles from Javelin missiles. Beefing up the separatists\' arsenal may
be the best option for Russia to respond to the U.S.-Ukraine lethal
weapons deal without making relations with the United States much worse.
In addition, [Moscow could opt for an asymmetric response]{.underline}.
[Russia could use the hybrid tactics it routinely employs against
Ukraine]{.underline} --- **[including]{.underline}** [targeted
assassinations of security forces and officials]{.underline},
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}**, [economic restrictions, and political
manipulation]{.underline} --- [to **put more pressure** on the country
and its Western backers]{.underline}. [It could even apply these methods
outside Ukraine, for instance in]{.underline} Syria or in the
**[European borderlands]{.underline}**, [to retaliate against the United
States for increasing support to the Ukrainian government. Russia, after
all, has followed a similar strategy many times in the
past]{.underline}.

#### Disputes over Ukraine deadlock [overall]{.underline} US-Russia strategic relations -- key to arms control and preventing nuclear terrorism

When President Barack Obama hosts leaders from dozens of countries [at a
summit]{.underline} in Washington on Thursday [to discuss nuclear
security]{.underline}, the nation with the world's biggest atomic
arsenal --- [Russia]{.underline} --- [will not be at the table. Russia's
boycott of the Nuclear Security Summit reflects a widening rift between
Moscow and Washington that has **undermined the U.S.-led effort to lock
down radiological material**]{.underline}, effectively destroyed
prospects for arms control between the two powers, **[and even raised
the risk of a potential nuclear confrontation]{.underline}** not seen
since the Cold War. [**Russia has an indispensable role to play in any
effort to prevent nuclear terrorism** because it has a vast amount of
nuclear material on its territory]{.underline} --- by far the most of
any country in the world. [And U.S.-Russian collaboration has formed the
cornerstone of groundbreaking efforts over the past two decades to
secure weapons stockpiles across the former Soviet Union and prevent the
**theft of material that could be used to make atomic bombs or more
crude "dirty bombs."** That cooperation has come to an end]{.underline},
much to the alarm of many U.S. officials. [The Defense Department is
concerned by the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and
trafficking of radiological material, "particularly as **we are no
longer able to ensure that nuclear material is being controlled at the
source in Russia**]{.underline}," Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Michelle
Baldanza said in an email. [Moscow's absence at the summit illustrates
how **the discord caused by its incursion into Ukraine has spilled over
into the arena of nuclear arms and security**.]{.underline} Russia's
willingness to work with the West started to decline in recent years as
Moscow's disagreements with Washington escalated over issues like U.S.
plans for a missile defense shield. [In 2013, Russia pulled out of a
1990s-era U.S. program called the Nunn-Lugar Act that helped **track and
secure tons of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium.** Under the former
program, the United States had provided detection devices, security
equipment, and training to help the Russians keep tabs on its
radiological material]{.underline}. And the effort helped sustain a
useful communication channel for American and Russian scientists. Now
[that cooperation has been abandoned, **even as the threat of terrorists
getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction has
grown.**]{.underline} The Islamic State extremists who launched the
deadly March 22 attacks in Brussels that killed 32 people are suspected
of planning to target the country's nuclear reactors as well as
employees there, and Belgian authorities have come under criticism over
reports of lax security at the sites. [Given the threat posed by the
Islamic State, the nuclear summit]{.underline} hosted by Washington ---
the fourth since Obama took office --- [will focus on how countries can
work "to prevent the world's most dangerous networks from
obtaining]{.underline} the world's most dangerous
[weapons]{.underline}," the U.S. president wrote in an op-ed published
Wednesday in the Washington Post. But Obama's commentary made no mention
of Russia's decision to skip the summit or cancel its cooperation on
security efforts. The Russian withdrawal from the U.S. effort to counter
nuclear terrorism is "a disappointment," William Courtney told Foreign
Policy, the former U.S. ambassador to Georgia and Kazakhstan. "[The
Russians not participating]{.underline} doesn't derail it, but it
[hinders it]{.underline}." Moscow has halted all U.S. access to
so-called "closed cities" that house a significant amount of Russia's
weapons-grade material, preventing American experts from certifying
whether security measures are sufficient. "[The concern is not that
Russia doesn't take its nuclear materials seriously]{.underline},"
Kingston Reif, the director of disarmament and threat reduction policy
at the Washington-based Arms Control Association, told FP. "The concern
is that it raises questions about Russia's willingness to strengthen
nuclear security and improve the architecture in place." Russia has
insisted it does not need American assistance to keep its nuclear
material safe. But the country's growing economic woes, including plans
for a 5 percent cut in the defense budget, have raised fears that
funding for security and monitoring at nuclear sites could suffer,
experts said. William Tobey, a senior fellow at Harvard University's
Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said that
"**[Russia's nuclear security is not what it should be]{.underline}**."
"The Russians try to preserve personnel amid budget constraints, and
while they have kept [nuclear inspectors]{.underline}, the inspectors
[are very limited in their travel budget now]{.underline}," Tobey told
FP. "So they can't go out and inspect the facilities they are in charge
of regulating like before." Apart from the standstill on nuclear
security initiatives, [Russia and the United States have hit a dead end
on arms control talks]{.underline}, marking the first time in decades
that the two sides have no agenda and no negotiations underway on a new
deal to reduce their vast nuclear stockpiles. In combative rhetoric that
harked back to the Soviet era, Moscow also has made frequent references
to Russia's nuclear arsenal. In combative rhetoric that harked back to
the Soviet era, Moscow also has made frequent references to Russia's
nuclear arsenal. In March 2015, Russia's ambassador in Copenhagen said
Danish warships would be "targets for Russian nuclear missiles" if they
installed advanced radar equipment. Russia has said the Iskander
missiles it has placed in its territory of Kaliningrad are dual-use,
meaning they could carry nuclear warheads. [NATO and U.S. officials say
**Russia is blurring the line between conventional and nuclear
war**]{.underline}. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference in
February, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's threats
and exercises of its nuclear forces were "aimed at intimidating its
neighbors," while U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said at a November
2015 forum that "[Moscow's nuclear saber-rattling raises questions about
Russian leaders' commitments to strategic stability]{.underline}."
Against the backdrop of an escalating war of words, the prospects for
communication designed to reduce the risk of a conflict between Moscow
and Washington have steadily dimmed. **[In the wake of Russia's armed
intervention in Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014, **[Washington suspended
military-to-military relations]{.underline}** [with Moscow and imposed
travel bans on some officials]{.underline}. Moscow has responded with
its own travel bans. Some arms control advocates and former senior U.S.
officials and lawmakers, including former Sen. Sam Nunn, have questioned
the Obama administration's decision to introduce travel bans on some
Russian officials, saying any step that reduces the chance for dialogue
is a mistake. "Common sense would seem to tell us that it is
counterproductive for both the U.S. and Russia to have sanctions on
individuals and policymakers who need to talk to each other to protect
the security of the citizens they represent," Nunn said in a speech in
Moscow in February. Despite the suspension in military relations,
communication between the two armed forces on essential missions related
to nuclear weapons continues, Pentagon officials told FP. But the
accumulative effect of the acrimony has created the worst climate
between the two countries since the Cold War. [Encroachments by Russian
nuclear-capable bombers near NATO countries in the Baltics and sorties
into Swedish and Finnish airspace, along with Russian military exercises
that simulate the use of tactical nuclear weapons, have sent alarm bells
ringing in Europe]{.underline}. In response, Russian officials have
accused NATO and the United States of behaving recklessly, citing the
deployment of more U.S. tanks and personnel to NATO states bordering
Russia and the use of B-2 bombers in drills close to the Russian border.
"There is no goodwill on either side," Alexey Arbatov, the chair of the
Carnegie Moscow Center's nonproliferation program and a former member of
the Russian State Duma, told FP. "Our militaries have stopped
communicating, and they are losing understanding of each other," said
Arbatov. "There is growing mistrust and exaggeration of the other's
capabilities and intentions on both sides." Nunn, the former Georgia
senator, was one of the architects of [the Cooperative Threat Reduction
program, also known as the Nunn-Lugar Act]{.underline}, which was
launched amid warming ties between Moscow and Washington after the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Designed to **[address fears over nuclear
weapons or material falling into the hands of terrorists or rogue
governments]{.underline}**, [the joint U.S.-Russian program provided
improved security and detection at Russian facilities]{.underline}.
**[The program also helped secure nuclear weapons from former Soviet
territories such as]{.underline}** Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** by bringing the armaments back to Russia and
dismantling them. Both countries also agreed to drastically cut their
weapons stockpiles and took steps to reduce the risk of losing control
over nuclear arms or accidental launches. By the early 2000s,
[cooperation had started to slow down]{.underline}. In 2002, the United
States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a hallmark of
Cold War nuclear arms control. There was a rare burst of optimism in
2010 when Washington and Moscow signed the New START Treaty, which
further reduced U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. [Still, the countries
retain enormous numbers of the world's most dangerous weapons: As of
January 2015, Russia and the United States had more than 7,000 nuclear
warheads each, about 90 percent of world stocks]{.underline}, according
to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. And those
numbers may not go down anytime soon. Russia has made it clear that
removing U.S. missile defense weaponry from Europe is a precondition for
any talks on a new arms control treaty. The Obama administration has
said that is out of the question.

The escalating threats between North Korea and the United States make it
easy to forget the "nuclear nightmare," as former US Secretary of
Defense William J. Perry put it, that could result even from the use of
just a single terrorist nuclear bomb in the heart of a major city. At
the risk of repeating the vast literature on the tragedies of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki---and the substantial literature surrounding nuclear tests
and simulations since then---we attempt to spell out here the likely
consequences of the explosion of [a single terrorist nuclear bomb on a
major city]{.underline}, and its subsequent ripple effects on the rest
of the planet. Depending on where and when it was detonated, the blast,
fire, initial radiation, and long-term radioactive fallout from such a
bomb could leave the heart of a major city a smoldering radioactive
ruin, killing tens or hundreds of thousands of people and wounding
hundreds of thousands more. Vast areas would have to be evacuated and
might be uninhabitable for years. Economic, political, and social
aftershocks would ripple throughout the world. A single terrorist
nuclear bomb [would change history]{.underline}. The country
attacked---and the world---would never be the same. [The idea of
terrorists accomplishing such a thing is]{.underline}, unfortunately,
[not out of the question; it is far easier to make a crude]{.underline},
unsafe, unreliable nuclear [explosive]{.underline} that might fit in the
back of a truck [than it is to make a safe, reliable weapon]{.underline}
of known yield that can be delivered by missile or combat aircraft.
[Numerous government studies have concluded that it is
plausible]{.underline} that [a]{.underline} sophisticated [terrorist
group could make a crude bomb if they got the]{.underline} needed
nuclear [material]{.underline}. And in the last quarter century, [there
have been]{.underline} some [20 seizures of stolen]{.underline},
weapons-usable nuclear [material, and at least two terrorist groups have
made significant efforts to acquire nuclear bombs.]{.underline}
Terrorist use of an actual nuclear bomb is a low-probability event---but
the immensity of the consequences means that even a small chance is
enough to justify an intensive effort to reduce the risk. Fortunately,
since the early 1990s, countries around the world have significantly
reduced the danger---but it remains very real, and there is more to do
to ensure this nightmare never becomes reality. Brighter than a thousand
suns. Imagine a crude terrorist nuclear bomb---containing a chunk of
highly enriched uranium just under the size of a regulation bowling
ball, or a much smaller chunk of plutonium---suddenly detonating inside
a delivery van parked in the heart of a major city. Such a terrorist
bomb would release as much as 10 kilotons of explosive energy, or the
equivalent of 10,000 tons of conventional explosives, a volume of
explosives large enough to fill all the cars of a mile-long train. In a
millionth of a second, all of that energy would be released inside that
small ball of nuclear material, creating temperatures and pressures as
high as those at the center of the sun. That furious energy would
explode outward, releasing its energy in three main ways: a powerful
blast wave; intense heat; and deadly radiation. The ball would expand
almost instantly into a fireball the width of four football fields,
incinerating essentially everything and everyone within. The heated
fireball would rise, sucking in air from below and expanding above,
creating the mushroom cloud that has become the symbol of the terror of
the nuclear age. The ionized plasma in the fireball would create a
localized electromagnetic pulse more powerful than lightning, shorting
out communications and electronics nearby---though most would be
destroyed by the bomb's other effects in any case. (Estimates of heat,
blast, and radiation effects in this article are drawn primarily from
Alex Wellerstein's "Nukemap," which itself comes from declassified US
government data, such as the 660-page government textbook The Effects of
Nuclear Weapons.) At the instant of its detonation, [the bomb would also
release an intense burst of]{.underline} gamma and neutron [radiation
which would be lethal for nearly everyone]{.underline} directly exposed
[within]{.underline} about [two-thirds of a mile]{.underline} from the
center of the blast. (Those who happened to be shielded by being inside,
or having buildings between them and the bomb, would be partly
protected---in some cases, reducing their doses by ten times or more.)
The nuclear flash from the heat of the fireball would radiate in both
visible light and the infrared; it would be "brighter than a thousand
suns," in the words of the title of a book describing the development of
nuclear weapons---adapting a phrase from the Hindu epic the
Bhagavad-Gita. Anyone who looked directly at the blast would be blinded.
The heat from the fireball would ignite fires and horribly burn everyone
exposed outside at distances of nearly a mile away. (In the Nagasaki
Atomic Bomb Museum, visitors gaze in horror at the bones of a human hand
embedded in glass melted by the bomb.) No one has burned a city on that
scale in the decades since World War II, so it is difficult to predict
the full extent of the fire damage that would occur from the explosion
of a nuclear bomb in one of today's cities. Modern glass, steel, and
concrete buildings would presumably be less flammable than the
wood-and-rice-paper housing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki in the 1940s---but
many questions remain, including exactly how [thousands of broken gas
lines]{.underline} might [contribute to fire damage]{.underline} (as
they did in Dresden during World War II). On 9/11, the buildings of the
World Trade Center proved to be much more vulnerable to fire damage than
had been expected. Ultimately, even a crude terrorist nuclear bomb would
carry the possibility that the countless fires touched off by the
explosion would coalesce into a devastating firestorm, as occurred at
Hiroshima. In a firestorm, the rising column of hot air from the massive
fire sucks in the air from all around, creating hurricane-force winds;
everything flammable and everything alive within the firestorm would be
consumed. The fires and the dust from the blast would make it extremely
difficult for either rescuers or survivors to see. The explosion would
create a powerful blast wave rushing out in every direction. For more
than a quarter-mile all around the blast, the pulse of pressure would be
over 20 pounds per square inch above atmospheric pressure (known as
"overpressure"), destroying or severely damaging even sturdy buildings.
The combination of blast, heat, and radiation would kill virtually
everyone in this zone. The blast would be accompanied by winds of many
hundreds of miles per hour. The damage from the explosion would extend
far beyond this inner zone of almost total death. Out to more than half
a mile, the blast would be strong enough to collapse most residential
buildings and create a serious danger that office buildings would topple
over, killing those inside and those in the path of the rubble. (On the
other hand, the office towers of a modern city would tend to block the
blast wave in some areas, providing partial protection from the blast,
as well as from the heat and radiation.) In that zone, almost anything
made of wood would be destroyed: Roofs would cave in, windows would
shatter, gas lines would rupture. Telephone poles, street lamps, and
utility lines would be severely damaged. Many roads would be blocked by
mountains of wreckage. In this zone, many people would be killed or
injured in building collapses, or trapped under the rubble; many more
would be burned, blinded, or injured by flying debris. In many cases,
their charred skin would become ragged and fall off in sheets. The
effects of the detonation would act in deadly synergy. The smashed
materials of buildings broken by the blast would be far easier for the
fires to ignite than intact structures. The effects of radiation would
make it far more difficult for burned and injured people to recover. The
combination of burns, radiation, and physical injuries would cause far
more death and suffering than any one of them would alone. The silent
killer. [The bomb's immediate effects would be followed by]{.underline}
a slow, lingering killer: radioactive [fallout]{.underline}. A bomb
detonated at ground level would dig a huge crater, hurling tons of earth
and debris thousands of feet into the sky. Sucked into the rising
fireball, these particles would mix with the radioactive remainders of
the bomb, and over the next few hours or days, the debris would rain
down for miles downwind. Depending on weather and wind patterns, the
fallout could actually be deadlier and make a far larger area unusable
than the blast itself. Acute radiation sickness from the initial
radiation pulse and the fallout would likely affect tens of thousands of
people. Depending on the dose, they might suffer from vomiting, watery
diarrhea, fever, sores, loss of hair, and bone marrow depletion. Some
would survive; some would die within days; some would take months to
die. Cancer rates among the survivors would rise. Women would be more
vulnerable than men---children and infants especially so. Much of the
radiation from a nuclear blast is short-lived; radiation levels even a
few days after the blast would be far below those in the first hours.
For those not killed or terribly wounded by the initial explosion, the
best advice would be to take shelter in a basement for at least several
days. But many would be too terrified to stay. Thousands of
panic-stricken people might receive deadly doses of radiation as they
fled from their homes. Some of the radiation will be longer-lived; areas
most severely affected would have to be abandoned for many years after
the attack. The combination of radioactive fallout and the devastation
of nearly all life-sustaining infrastructure over a vast area would mean
that hundreds of thousands of people would have to evacuate. Ambulances
to nowhere. [The explosion would]{.underline} also [destroy much of the
city's ability to respond. Hospitals would be leveled, doctors and
nurses killed]{.underline} and wounded, [ambulances
destroyed]{.underline}. (In Hiroshima, 42 of 45 hospitals were destroyed
or severely damaged, and 270 of 300 doctors were killed.) Resources that
survived outside the zone of destruction would be utterly overwhelmed.
Hospitals have no ability to cope with tens or hundreds of thousands of
terribly burned and injured people all at once; the United States, for
example, has 1,760 burn beds in hospitals nationwide, of which a third
are available on any given day. And the problem would not be limited to
hospitals; [firefighters]{.underline}, for example, [would have little
ability to cope with thousands of fires]{.underline} raging out of
control at once. Fire stations and equipment would be destroyed in the
affected area, and firemen killed, along with police and other emergency
responders. Some of the first responders may become casualties
themselves, from radioactive fallout, fire, and collapsing buildings.
Over much of the affected area, communications would be destroyed, by
both the physical effects and the electromagnetic pulse from the
explosion. Better preparation for such a disaster could save thousands
of lives---but ultimately, there is no way any city can genuinely be
prepared for a catastrophe on such a historic scale, occurring in a
flash, with zero warning. Rescue and recovery attempts would be impeded
by the destruction of most of the needed personnel and equipment, and by
fire, debris, radiation, fear, lack of communications, and the immense
scale of the disaster. The US military and the national guard could
provide critically important capabilities---but federal plans assume
that "no significant federal response" would be available for 24-to-72
hours. Many of those burned and injured would wait in vain for help,
food, or water, perhaps for days. The scale of death and suffering. How
many would die in such an event, and how many would be terribly wounded,
would depend on where and when the bomb was detonated, what the weather
conditions were at the time, how successful the response was in helping
the wounded survivors, and more. Many estimates of casualties are based
on census data, which reflect where people sleep at night; if the attack
occurred in the middle of a workday, the numbers of people crowded into
the office towers at the heart of many modern cities would be far
higher. The daytime population of Manhattan, for example, is roughly
twice its nighttime population; in Midtown on a typical workday, there
are an estimated 980,000 people per square mile. A 10-kiloton weapon
detonated there might well kill half a million people---not counting
those who might die of radiation sickness from the fallout. (These
effects were analyzed in great detail in the Rand Corporation's
Considering the Effects of a Catastrophic Terrorist Attack and the
British Medical Journal's "Nuclear terrorism.") On a typical day, the
wind would blow the fallout north, seriously contaminating virtually all
of Manhattan above Gramercy Park; people living as far away as Stamford,
Connecticut would likely have to evacuate. Seriously injured survivors
would greatly outnumber the dead, their suffering magnified by the
complete inadequacy of available help. The psychological and social
effects---overwhelming sadness, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder, myriad forms of anxiety---would be profound and long-lasting.
The scenario we have been describing is a groundburst. An
airburst---such as might occur, for example, if terrorists put their
bomb in a small aircraft they had purchased or rented---would extend the
blast and fire effects over a wider area, killing and injuring even
larger numbers of people immediately. But an airburst would not have the
same lingering effects from fallout as a groundburst, because the rock
and dirt would not be sucked up into the fireball and contaminated. The
10-kiloton blast we have been discussing is likely toward the high end
of what terrorists could plausibly achieve with a crude, improvised
bomb, but even a 1-kiloton blast would be a catastrophic event, having a
deadly radius between one-third and one-half that of a 10-kiloton blast.
These hundreds of thousands of people would not be mere statistics, but
countless individual stories of loss---parents, children, entire
families; all religions; rich and poor alike---killed or horribly
mutilated. Human suffering and tragedy on this scale does not have to be
imagined; it can be remembered through the stories of the survivors of
the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only times in
history when nuclear weapons have been used intentionally against human
beings. The pain and suffering caused by those bombings are almost
beyond human comprehension; the eloquent testimony of the
Hibakusha---the survivors who passed through the atomic fire---should
stand as an eternal reminder of the need to prevent nuclear weapons from
ever being used in anger again. [Global economic disaster]{.underline}.
The economic impact of such an attack would be enormous. [The effects
would reverberate for so far and]{.underline} so [long that they are
difficult to estimate]{.underline} in all their complexity. Hundreds of
thousands of people would be too injured or sick to work for weeks or
months. Hundreds of thousands more would evacuate to locations far from
their jobs. Many places of employment would have to be abandoned because
of the radioactive fallout. Insurance companies would reel under the
losses; but at the same time, many insurance policies exclude the
effects of nuclear attacks---an item insurers considered beyond their
ability to cover---so the owners of thousands of buildings would not
have the insurance payments needed to cover the cost of fixing them,
thousands of companies would go bankrupt, and banks would be left
holding an immense number of mortgages that would never be repaid.
[Consumer]{.underline} and investor [confidence would]{.underline}
likely [be dramatically affected]{.underline}, as worried people slowed
their spending. Enormous new homeland security and military investments
would be very likely. If the bomb had come in a shipping container, the
targeted country---and possibly others---might stop all containers from
entering until it could devise a system for ensuring they could never
again be used for such a purpose, throwing a wrench into the gears of
global trade for an extended period. (And this might well occur even if
a shipping container had not been the means of delivery.) Even the far
smaller 9/11 attacks are estimated to have caused economic aftershocks
costing almost \$1 trillion even excluding the multi-trillion-dollar
costs of the wars that ensued. The cost of a terrorist nuclear attack in
a major city would likely be many times higher. The most severe effects
would be local, but the effects of trade disruptions, reduced economic
activity, and more would reverberate around the world. Consequently,
while some countries may feel that nuclear terrorism is only a concern
for the countries most likely to be targeted---such as the United
States---in reality it is a threat to everyone, everywhere. In 2005,
then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned that these global effects
would push "tens of millions of people into dire poverty," creating "a
second death toll throughout the developing world." One recent estimate
suggested that a nuclear attack in an urban area would cause a global
recession, cutting global Gross Domestic Product by some two percent,
and pushing an additional 30 million people in the developing world into
extreme poverty. Desperate dilemmas. In short, [an act of nuclear
terrorism could rip the heart out of a major city]{.underline}, and
cause ripple effects throughout the world. The government of the country
attacked would face desperate decisions: How to help the city attacked?
How to prevent further attacks? How to respond or retaliate?
[Terrorists]{.underline}---either those who committed the attack or
others---[would]{.underline} probably [claim they had more bombs already
hidden in other cities]{.underline} (whether they did or not), and
threaten to detonate them unless their demands were met. The fear that
this might be true could lead people to flee major cities in a
large-scale, uncontrolled evacuation. There is very little ability to
support the population of major cities in the surrounding countryside.
The potential for widespread havoc and economic chaos is very real. [If
the detonation took place in the capital]{.underline} of the nation
attacked, [much of the government might be destroyed]{.underline}. A
bomb in Washington, D.C., for example, might kill the President, the
Vice President, and many of the members of Congress and the Supreme
Court. (Having some plausible national leader survive is a key reason
why one cabinet member is always elsewhere on the night of the State of
the Union address.) Elaborate, classified plans for "continuity of
government" have already been drawn up in a number of countries, but the
potential for chaos and confusion---if almost all of a country's top
leaders were killed---would still be enormous. Who, for example, could
address the public on what the government would do, and what the public
should do, to respond? Could anyone honestly assure the public there
would be no further attacks? If they did, who would believe them? In the
United States, given the practical impossibility of passing major
legislation with Congress in ruins and most of its members dead or
seriously injured, some have argued for passing legislation in advance
giving the government emergency powers to act---and creating procedures,
for example, for legitimately replacing most of the House of
Representatives. But to date, no such legislative preparations have been
made. In what would inevitably be a desperate effort to prevent further
attacks, [traditional standards of civil liberties might be
jettisoned]{.underline}, at least for a time---particularly when people
realized that the fuel for the bomb that had done such damage would
easily have fit in a suitcase. Old rules limiting search and
surveillance could be among the first to go. The government might well
impose martial law as it sought to control the situation, hunt for the
perpetrators, and find any additional weapons or nuclear materials they
might have. Even the far smaller attacks of 9/11 saw the US government
authorizing torture of prisoners and mass electronic surveillance. [And
what standards of international order and law would still hold
sway?]{.underline} **[The country attacked might well lash out
militarily at whatever countries it thought might bear a portion of
responsibility]{.underline}**. (A terrifying description of the kinds of
discussions that might occur appeared in Brian Jenkins' book, Will
Terrorists Go Nuclear?) With the nuclear threshold already crossed in
this scenario---at least by terrorists---it is conceivable that some of
[**the resulting conflicts might escalate to nuclear use**.
International politics could become more brutish and violent, with
powerful states taking unilateral action, by force if necessary, in an
effort to ensure their security]{.underline}. After 9/11, the United
States led the invasions of two sovereign nations, in wars that have
since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars,
while plunging a region into chaos. Would the reaction after a far more
devastating nuclear attack be any less? In particular, the idea that
each state can decide for itself how much security to provide for
nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients would likely be seen as
totally unacceptable following such an attack. Powerful states would
likely demand that others surrender their nuclear material or accept
foreign troops (or other imposed security measures) to guard it. [That
could well be the first step toward a more profound transformation of
the international system. After such a catastrophe, major powers may
feel compelled to more freely engage in preventive war, seizing
territories]{.underline} they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe
havens, and taking other steps they see as brutal but necessary to
preserve their security. For this reason, foreign policy analyst Stephen
Krasner has argued that "conventional rules of sovereignty would be
abandoned overnight." Confidence in both the national security
institutions of the country attacked and international institutions such
as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations, which
had so manifestly failed to prevent the devastation, might erode. The
effect on nuclear weapons policies is hard to predict: One can imagine
new nuclear terror driving a new push for nuclear disarmament, but [one
could also imagine states feeling more certain than ever before that
they needed nuclear weapons. Prevention: The essential
remedy]{.underline}. Given the horrifying consequences of such an event,
while there is certainly a need to be better prepared to respond, the
primary focus must be on prevention. Fortunately, there is good news on
this front. To date, there is no evidence that nuclear weapons or the
materials needed to make them have ever fallen into the hands of a
terrorist group; even large and sophisticated terrorist groups that have
tried to get nuclear weapons have failed to do so; and the international
community has taken a wide range of actions over the past
quarter-century (and particularly over the 2010-2016 period of the
nuclear security summits) that have drastically improved the security
measures for nuclear weapons and materials around the world.
Nevertheless, while [the chance]{.underline} of such a nightmare
unfolding is probably small, it [is]{.underline} certainly [not small
enough to justify complacency. Al Qaeda had a focused effort to acquire
nuclear weapons that reported directly to Ayman al-Zawahiri, now the
group's leader, and included multiple attempts to get nuclear material
and recruit nuclear expertise; Al Qaeda progressed as far as carrying
out crude conventional explosive tests for their bomb program in the
Afghan desert]{.underline}. The Japanese terror cult [Aum
Shinrikyo]{.underline}---the group that launched nerve gas attacks in
the Tokyo subway in 1995--- [also pursued nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
To date, [there are]{.underline} only [hints of]{.underline} nuclear
[interest from the Islamic State]{.underline}, but if it did turn to
nuclear pursuits, even with the imminent defeat of its geographic
caliphate in Iraq and Syria, it still has more money, people, and
ability to recruit experts globally than most past terrorist groups,
raising a serious concern. With at least two terrorist groups having
pursued nuclear weapons over the past quarter-century, and possibly
more, it is unlikely they will be the last. Moreover, the past seizures
of stolen weapons-usable nuclear material demonstrate that **[nuclear
security failures have occurred at some point in the
past]{.underline}**. While nuclear security has improved dramatically in
many countries in the past quarter-century, [the possibility that
terrorists could get the essential ingredients of a nuclear bomb still
cannot be ruled out]{.underline}. What then, must be done? First, [major
efforts are needed to recover some of the **momentum imparted to nuclear
security programs** by the now-completed nuclear security summit
process, revitalizing efforts to address remaining
weaknesses]{.underline}. Second, because nuclear security is unlikely to
be perfect, other layers of defense are needed to cope with nuclear
material that has already been stolen, including stronger anti-nuclear
smuggling efforts (especially national police and intelligence teams),
better intelligence focused on nuclear smuggling, beefed-up interdiction
abilities if intelligence identifies where such items are located, and
improved means of detecting efforts to bring a nuclear weapon or its
pieces into major cities. Third, deterrence can play a part,
particularly in convincing states never to consciously provide nuclear
weapons or materials to terrorists ---and toward that end, continued
investments in nuclear forensics capabilities are needed, to help
identify where nuclear material might have come from. Fourth, more
intelligence effort---and more international intelligence
cooperation---is needed that is targeted on identifying and stopping
terrorist plots aimed at nuclear terrorism, and dismantling groups that
may harbor such ambitions. [No one knows]{.underline} what [the real
probability]{.underline} of nuclear terrorism is. It may well be quite
low. There is no need for panic, which is exactly what terrorists have
sought to achieve by repeatedly claiming to have nuclear weapons. But
there is a need for prudent, focused action. Given the scale of the
consequences, the countries of the world have an obligation to do
everything in their power to ensure that the dark day after a terrorist
nuclear blast never comes.

U.S. [Energy Department efforts to secure vulnerable nuclear materials
in Russia have stalled following the expiration of a long-held agreement
with Moscow last summer]{.underline}, an agency official said on
Tuesday. **[The now-tenuous situation in]{.underline}** neighboring
**[Ukraine may further delay the initiatives]{.underline}**, according
to Anne Harrington, deputy administrator for defense nuclear
nonproliferation at the department\'s semiautonomous National Nuclear
Security Administration. [The]{.underline} so-called [Cooperative Threat
Reduction umbrella agreement expired]{.underline} in June, in part
[because Moscow was no longer interested in extending a pact that
shielded the U.S. government and its contractors from virtually all
liability]{.underline} from incidents that could occur during the course
of work on Russian soil. [The 20-year-old-accord is often referred to as
the \"Nunn-Lugar\" agreement]{.underline}, due to the roles former
Senators Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) played in forging
the pact as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Much of the work under the
agreement was conducted by the U.S. Defense Department and its
contractors under the Pentagon\'s Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
However, **[Energy Department nonproliferation programs]{.underline}**
also **[played a significant role in helping lock down vulnerable
nuclear materials leftover from the Cold War.]{.underline}** Following
the agreement\'s expiration, Obama administration officials asserted
(http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/us-official-most-doe-nuclear-security-work-russia-will-continue/)
last summer that most Energy Department work in Russia would continue
unfettered. Harrington told Global Security Newswire in August
(http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/q-changes-coming-us-effort-stop-nuclear-smuggling/)
that while implementing language for a new pact with Moscow was still
being worked out, she did not expect any significant interruptions to
Energy\'s contractor work in Russia. However, Harrington said on Tuesday
that **[negotiations]{.underline}** pertaining to the implementing
language **[were taking longer than expected. The current situation in
Ukraine]{.underline}** \-- in which the Obama administration has
criticized the apparent presence of Russian troops in the former Soviet
republic \-- **[could further hamper the negotiations]{.underline}**,
Harrington said. \"We are actively in the process of negotiating those
changes to the agreement, but obviously [the current situation between
Russia and Ukraine \-- and what decisions the White House and the
president make on the future of our engagement with Russia \-- is to be
determined]{.underline},\" said Harrington. **[In the interim, Energy
Department efforts to finish securing vulnerable nuclear materials have
been put on hold]{.underline}**, said Harrington, who was asked to
explain proposed cuts in the administration\'s fiscal 2015 budget
proposal. \"Until we have the contracts back in place, we had to suspend
work at a variety of sites and so the funding and the teams of experts
are standing eagerly ready to go back to work,\" Harrington said during
a conference call with reporters regarding the newly delivered budget
request
(http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/us-energy-dept-seeks-83-billion-nuclear-arsenal-work/).
\"That just is one of those victims \-- anytime you have a major
agreement or contract change there are a lot of technical issues that go
into making everything work smoothly again.\" A summary of
[the]{.underline} 2015 [budget proposal]{.underline}, released Tuesday,
[attributed a planned 27 percent cut to the International Material
Protection and Cooperation program in part on the expiration of the
Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement.]{.underline} Harrington
said **[this was partially the result of a freeze on work aimed at
securing buildings in Russia where sensitive nuclear materials are
stored.]{.underline}** \"Some of the final physical security work at the
buildings in Russia that we\'ve been working on has been suspended,\"
Harrington said. \"All of the buildings have some percentage of the
upgrades \-- anywhere between 40 and 70 percent of the upgrades at all
of the buildings were completed \-- but we\'ve had to wait to finish the
rest of buildings.\" Arms control advocates are criticizing the Obama
budget plan, which on the whole would cut Energy Department
nonproliferation efforts by 20 percent, while at the same time boosting
the agency\'s spending on nuclear weapons by nearly 7 percent. The
nuclear-weapons programs would receive \$8.3 billion, while the
nonproliferation efforts would receive \$1.6 billion. \"Clearly, a
contributing factor is that **[Russia has evolved into a reluctant and
increasingly hostile partner in this area]{.underline}**,\" the advocacy
group Partnership for Global Security said in a Wednesday statement,
noting that the budget plan also calls for the Pentagon Cooperative
Threat Reduction program to receive a 23 percent cut. \"But, Russian
reticence does not explain all the cuts. In fact, throughout his term,
the president\'s budgets for key nuclear control efforts have been
declining.\" President [Obama has flagged nuclear security as a major
priority of his administration]{.underline}. One outgrowth of that
pledge has been a series of global Nuclear Security Summits, the next of
which is to occur in The Netherlands later this month. [That summit
effort is in part responsible for the removal of all weapons-grade
nuclear materials from 12 countries in recent years]{.underline}.
Harrington told reporters on Tuesday that the fiscal 2015 budget plan
would enable the removal of an additional 125 kilos of plutonium and
highly enriched uranium. On the whole, however, the Partnership for
Global Security argued that \"the significant impression this new budget
leaves is that the administration does not understand that without
continued and strong U.S. leadership and funding, this agenda will fade
from the global stage and that this is a major international security
threat,\" the group said. The Energy Department\'s Global Threat
Reduction Initiative would be cut by 24 percent under the fiscal 2015
plan, as compared to what Congress approved for the current year. The
nonprofit Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation said in a Tuesday
statement that this would amount to a roughly 70 percent cut, as
compared to the funding the program received three years ago. **[Arms
control groups, along with some lawmakers, have raised concerns in
recent months that the program could fall behind in its efforts to
secure commercial facilities around the world that house radiological
material potentially usable in a dirty bomb]{.underline}**. These
concerns were amplified when a potent radiological source went missing
for a time in a stolen truck
(http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/after-mexican-theft-critics-question-if-iaea-radiological-security-rules-are-enough/)
late last year in Mexico. NNSA spokeswoman Keri Fulton told GSN on
Wednesday that based on current budget projections, the agency\'s goal
is to complete this work by 2044. Senate appropriators have previously
criticized
(http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/nuclear-security-and-omnibus-legislation-whats-and-whats-down/)
this date as being too far in the future, saying the program had
previously vowed to secure 85,000 buildings by 2025. So far, work on
only 1,500 buildings, or about 18 percent, has been completed, the
lawmakers said. On the nuclear-weapons side of the budget, the
administration in the spending request does plan to delay by five years
a plan to construct a new interoperable warhead
(http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/compromise-bill-could-make-nuclear-warhead-cost-study-less-painful/)
that had been criticized by arms control groups and some lawmakers. At
the same time, however, it is looking to boost funding to controversial
refurbishments to the B-61 gravity bomb. The Center for Arms Control on
Tuesday criticized the administration for looking to fund such weapons
projects \"on the back of key nonproliferation programs.\"

## AT DAs

### AT deterrence DA -- bluffing

#### Putin calls our bluff \-\-- arms cause Russian escalation \-\-- either the US responds in kind (nuclear war) or we are forced to back down

**Shapiro 15** -- Nonresident Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center on
the United States and Europe, Project on International Order and
Strategy (Jeremy, "Why Arming the Ukrainians is a Bad Idea," Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2015/02/03/why-arming-the-ukrainians-is-a-bad-idea/)//BB>

Steve Pifer is a good friend and a treasured colleague. And Strobe
Talbott is my boss---so it goes without saying that I greatly admire his
work. But as important as friendship and job security are to me, I still
can only conclude that [the]{.underline}ir [proposal to arm Ukrainians
will lead only to further violence and instability, and]{.underline}
possibly [a dangerous confrontation with Russia]{.underline}. Steve and
Strobe's article (and the supporting report with several other prominent
authors) rings with fury at Russian actions. And Russian actions are
indeed outrageous. But moral indignation, no matter how righteous and
satisfying, is not a strategy. A strategy needs to describe just how
provision of American arms would make the situation better. Rather than
such a description, the article suggests that a just cause and the
Ukrainian need and desire for weapons are enough to justify their
provision. But it is hardly surprising that the Ukrainians want American
arms in their war against Russia and Russian-backed separatists---they
face the possibility of territorial dismemberment and would run any risk
to preserve their state intact. [The Ukrainian calculus is one of
immediate desperation. But the United States needs to think for the
longer-term]{.underline}. And [if U.S.-provided weapons fail to induce a
Russian retreat in Ukraine and instead cause an escalation of the
war,]{.underline} [the net result will not be peace and
compromise]{.underline}. There has recently been much
[escalation]{.underline} in Ukraine, but it [could go **much**
further]{.underline}. As horrible as it is, the Ukrainian civil war
still looks rather tame by the standards of Bosnia, Chechnya or Syria.
Further escalation will mean much more violence, suffering and death in
Ukraine. The [report authors counter that if the United States does not
stand up to Russia in Ukraine, the Putin regime will be emboldened to
make similar mischief all over Europe and beyond]{.underline}. [This is
the familiar credibility argument that gave us the war in Vietnam, among
other misadventures.]{.underline} In fact, [U.S. credibility is **not
enhanced** by making bluffs that we will not ultimately fulfill or by
embarking on wasting wars that we do not need]{.underline}. [In any
case, Ukraine is a unique situation, both for the Russians and for the
United States. It is culturally and geographically supremely important
to the Russians and yet for the United States it has no intrinsic
geopolitical importance and is not a treaty ally]{.underline}. [The
Russians would be foolish to judge U.S. credibility in responding to
provocations in areas of greater importance to the United States on the
basis of its non-military response to Ukraine. And there is **no
evidence** that they are that foolish]{.underline}. In the meantime, [to
meet a Russian counter-escalation in Ukraine, the United States would
have to either escalate the conflict beyond where it was originally
willing to go or be forced into a humiliating retreat]{.underline}.
**[Neither is a]{.underline}** very attractive or
**[credibility-enhancing option]{.underline}**. [U.S. policy should work
very hard to avoid confronting that unpalatable choice. Otherwise, this
dynamic might well draw the United States deeper into what could become
a direct confrontation with a seriously pissed-off and still heavily
nuclear-armed Russia]{.underline}. TO ESCALATE OR NOT TO ESCALATE [So
the key question becomes: what will the Russians do]{.underline} in
response to America's provision of arms to its enemy? For Steve and
Strobe, the goal is to give "the Ukrainian military sufficient means to
make further aggression so costly that Putin and the Russian army are
deterred from escalating the fight." This seems a tall order. Ukraine is
clearly much more important to Russia than it is to United States.
Ukraine is also, unfortunately, located much closer to Russia than to
the United States. [Russia would appear to have many escalation options
and a clear incentive to exercise them]{.underline}. Indeed, [the
Russian military is far stronger than the Ukrainian
military]{.underline}, as we learned in late August when a one-off
injection of regular units led to hundreds of dead Ukrainians at
Ilovaisk. [No program of U.S. assistance will change that
balance]{.underline}. As the authors of the report admit, "\[e\]ven with
enormous support from the West, the Ukrainian army will not be able to
defeat a determined attack by the Russian military." So how do the
report authors think that the United States and their doughty Ukrainian
allies can force the Russians to back down in Ukraine? [The authors
assert that the secret to getting Russia to back down is to increase
Russian "costs", by which they mean Ukraine could take advantage of
Russia's sensitivity to casualties. U.S. arms will mean that Russian
soldiers will die in much greater numbers]{.underline} in the effort to
satisfy Russian objectives in Ukraine. The Russian government has been
hiding the deaths of their soldiers in Ukraine from their own population
for fear of the public reaction, and that will become much more
difficult if casualties increase dramatically. The government supposedly
fears the ire of Russian mothers whose devotion to the well-being of
their soldier-sons can move political mountains even in authoritarian
Russia. Rather than face a growing number of aroused and organized
Russian mothers, [the thinking goes]{.underline}, President Vladimir
[Putin will avoid escalation in Ukraine]{.underline}.
**[Unfortunately]{.underline}**, [one of the few more powerful forces
than mothers in Russian politics is anti-Americanism]{.underline}. [The
Russian regime has defined the struggle in Ukraine as part of an
existential battle against American imperialism, in which the United
States eventually seeks to impose its will on Russia
itself]{.underline}. American provision of arms would lend credence to
that view and increase the Russian government's freedom of action at
home. [One would like to believe in the power of Russian mothers to
conquer their government. But]{.underline} in the end, [it is hard to
find comfort in a plan whose success relies on Vladimir Putin's
sensitivity to death and to the suffering of the Russian
people]{.underline}.

#### That's offense \-\-- bluff-calling is a credibility hazard 

**Kofman 17** -- global fellow at the Wilson Center and a nonresident
fellow at the Modern War Institute (Michael, "For the U.S., Arming
Ukraine Could Be a Deadly Mistake," New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/opinion/united-states-arm-ukraine-missiles.html)//BB>

[The Trump administration's plan to arm Kiev is a serious political
decision that could have far-reaching strategic
consequences.]{.underline} [The United States is walking into a proxy
war with Moscow --- one that it is unprepared to win]{.underline}.
Notionally, helping Ukraine is admirable, but the lack of public
discussion and suddenness of this announcement are worrisome. [While
arming Kiev may seem like an easy political win, it is poor
policy]{.underline}. The idea of providing Ukraine with \$50
million-worth of anti-tank missiles is eerily reminiscent of
Washington's halfhearted efforts to train and arm the moderate Syrian
opposition. That plan was ill-conceived and ended in defeat after Russia
escalated its military backing of the government of President Bashar
al-Assad in 2015. Russia's interests in Ukraine are far greater and its
military superiority is well established. In contrast, [the United
States' coercive credibility in the region is close to
nonexistent.]{.underline} [The proposal to send arms to Kiev is also
untimely. Ukraine has not seen a Russian offensive, or lost significant
territory to Russia, in more than two years]{.underline}. Of all the
possible ways to help the country improve its armed forces, dumping
missiles on an unreformed military hardly seems the smart way forward.
This is the time to help the country transform, not play geopolitical
checkers with missiles. [Leading American generals in the
region]{.underline}, like the commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, Lt.
Gen. Ben Hodges, [have long argued that providing Ukraine with
arms]{.underline}, specifically Javelins, [would "not change the
situation strategically in a positive way]{.underline}." [There is no
indication of a forthcoming Russian attack]{.underline}, [but in any
case, the asymmetry of power between the two countries is so great that
no sensible analyst would argue that a few portable antitank missiles
could tip the balance]{.underline}. Given the nature of the conflict,
[there is little chance of exhausting Russia in Ukraine]{.underline}.
The Javelin is also an expensive and impractical choice to give a
country with a large military that already has anti-tank guided
missiles, and makes its own. For \$50 million, which will equip only a
fraction of Ukraine's armed forces with Javelins, Kiev could obtain a
much larger number of comparable weapons from other countries or
manufacture more at home. Most of the casualties in eastern Ukraine have
been, and continue to be, from artillery and small-arms fire. The
conflict has seen very few tank battles; those that did occur were among
small units. Despite the vaunted number of Russian tanks in Ukraine ---
a figure that is likely exaggerated --- this has never been a war of
major tank offensives. Ukraine's armed forces did employ anti-tank
guided missiles and inflicted losses on the separatists during the
battles of August 2014 and February 2015. Yet Kiev failed to achieve
victory, and the losses had little discernible deterrent effect on
Russia, which was always fighting for strategic leverage rather than
territory. The push to supply Javelin missiles to Ukraine is really a
political decision that would turn the conflict between Russia and
Ukraine into a proxy war between the United States and Russia.
Ukrainians may understandably dream of Washington's joining the
conflict, but American policy makers should remember that their
obligation is to their own national interest. Washington should focus
its attention instead on its NATO allies. [If the Trump administration's
intent is to send a signal to Moscow, then American officials should
remember that there are many in the Kremlin willing to send a signal
back]{.underline}. Have they considered the balance of interests, and
the capabilities both sides can bring to bear? Don't bet on it. [The
United States should]{.underline} also [exercise caution in the signals
it sends Ukraine.]{.underline} [There is **moral hazard for Washington
in belligerently proclaiming support for a nation when it has zero
intention to fight on that nation's behalf**]{.underline}. [Syria is a
recent case study of how not to win a proxy war that merits closer
examination before the United States embarks on another impulsive
venture]{.underline}.

### AT deterrence DA -- arms sales fail

#### Deterrence doesn't work in Ukraine \-\-- and Russia is [declining not revisionist]{.underline}

Ishaan **Tharoor 15**, \[Ishaan Tharoor, Ishaan Tharoor writes about

RA

[Here are some reasons to doubt the success of such a plan]{.underline}.
[Don\'t underestimate Russia\'s commitment to the fight]{.underline}.
[Neither the authors of the report nor any other serious advocates of
arming Kiev believe that better arming Kiev will actually enable
Ukraine\'s government to defeat the Russian-backed forces.]{.underline}
As Jeremy Shapiro, a Brookings scholar who recently wrote what serves as
a dissent to his boss\'s report, points out, [the calculus
is]{.underline} both cynical and perhaps [naive, given Moscow\'s
willingness to provoke bloodshed in the region]{.underline}. \"[It is
hard to find comfort in a plan whose success relies on Vladimir Putin\'s
sensitivity to death]{.underline},\" Shapiro writes, noting the surging
anti-American sentiment in Russia. [Direct U.S. military aid to Ukraine
would only deepen the anti-West, \"anti-imperialist\" narratives that
have dominated airwaves in Russia over the past year and would reinforce
the Kremlin\'s own messaging about the conflict as an existential
struggle for Moscow\'s future]{.underline}. \"[This coercive strategy is
also unlikely to work, **no matter how much punishment the West
inflicts**]{.underline},\" writes the international relations theorist
John Mearsheimer. \"What advocates of arming Ukraine fail to understand
is that [Russian leaders believe their country's core strategic
interests are at stake in Ukraine; they are unlikely to give ground,
even if it means absorbing huge costs]{.underline}.\" There\'s another
line of argument that stresses that, [for Putin, the power play in
Ukraine is **all that he may have left**.]{.underline} Harvard\'s
Stephen Walt, a known skeptic of U.S. interventionism, spells out
what\'s at stake for Russia: [Russia is **not an ambitious rising
power**]{.underline} like Nazi Germany or contemporary China; [it is an
aging, depopulating, and declining great power trying to cling to
whatever international influence it still possesses and preserve a
modest sphere of influence near its borders, so that stronger states ---
and especially the United States --- cannot take advantage of its
growing vulnerabilities]{.underline}. Ultimately, as Walt notes,
\"[Ukraine\'s fate is much more important to Moscow\" than it is to
those who happen to be animated by it right now in Washington. **In this
standoff, it\'s hard to believe Putin would ever be the one to blink
first**]{.underline}.

#### Even a military victory is short-lived

Affairs and former presidential advisor on arms control and
nonproliferation, \*\*founding director of the Russia Matters Project at

relations with great powers (Gary and Simon, "Cornering Putin Could
Backfire," Belfer Center,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/cornering-putin-could-backfire)//BB>

[Those trying to read the Russian leader's mind and discern his likely
reaction to growing pressure would do well to recall that]{.underline}
in the first year of his presidency [Putin confided to authors of his
biography how dangerous it could be to corner opponents]{.underline}.
[History books, of which Putin is an avid reader, contain many examples
of how cornering can backfire]{.underline}. John F. [Kennedy was aware
of that danger when confronting]{.underline} Nikita
[Khrushchev]{.underline} [over]{.underline} Soviet missiles covertly
deployed in [Cuba]{.underline} in 1962. [Nuclear war between the two
superpowers might have become inevitable if Kennedy hadn't left
Khrushchev an opportunity to settle the crisis peacefully without losing
face]{.underline}. Secondly, there are hundreds of thousands of
civilians trapped inside Donetsk and Luhansk. Storming of these cities
would result in civilian casualties that would further increase the
number of eastern Ukrainians who nurture long-term grievances vis-à-vis
the central government over the conflict, which has resulted in 1,100
deaths. And even if attainable without significant civilian casualties,
[a decisive military victory over pro-Russian forces]{.underline} in
Donetsk and Luhansk [won't bridge Ukraine's ethnic and political
divides]{.underline} between the pro-Russian southeast and pro-Western
provinces in the center and west. [The losing side **will not accept
defeat** and will wait for the next chance to challenge the
outcome]{.underline}, most probably [with Russia's support]{.underline}.
In fact, Ukraine's foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, acknowledged in a
July 30 interview with Reuters that only a political solution can end
the conflict. [Nor would a military victory eliminate Russia's leverage
on Ukraine]{.underline}, which had depended on its eastern neighbor for
one-third of its imports and exports before the conflict. [Leaders in
Kiev, Moscow, and Western capitals need to understand the costs of
trying to solve the conflict with force]{.underline} and the benefits of
finding a negotiated solution. Such a solution could incorporate
elements of Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko's own peace plan, such as
amnesty for the rebels, decentralization of power within Ukraine and
robust protection of rights of minorities, along with disarming of all
the illegal armed formations, a legally binding affirmation of Ukraine's
military neutrality, and unequivocal guarantees (rather than assurances)
of Ukraine's territorial integrity, perhaps, while deferring final
resolution of Crimea's status. The United States and the European Union
should encourage Poroshenko to revive his peace plan. Russia should also
press the separatists to negotiate in good faith and aim for realistic
goals, such as reintegration into a decentralized Ukraine. [The goal of
these]{.underline} collective [efforts **shouldn't be** total victory
for any military alliance]{.underline}, nation, region, or leader.
Instead, what eventually emerges ought to be a Ukraine at peace with
itself and its neighbors, outside of any military pact, and capable of
sustaining itself economically.

#### Putin can't be deterred in Ukraine \-\-- all empirical evidence supports this conclusion

**DePetris 17** - MA in Political Science @ Syracuse, fellow at Defense
Priorities (Daniel, "Russia Will Retaliate After U.S. Supplies Lethal
Weapons To Ukraine," Breaking Defense,
https://breakingdefense.com/2017/12/russia-will-retaliate-after-u-s-supplies-lethal-weapons-to-ukraine/)//BB

Last week, the Trump administration agreed to send lethal defensive
weapons to Ukraine. The order, packaged by the State Department as an
affirmation of Ukraine's right to defend itself against Russian-backed
aggression, was greeted on Capitol Hill as a logical step in confronting
what many lawmakers view as Vladimir Putin's expansionist foreign
policy. [Proponents]{.underline} of this recommendation [argue that the
bloodier Russia's nose becomes and the higher the death toll for Russian
soldiers on the battlefield, the more pressure Putin will be under to
cut ties with the]{.underline} outgunned and outmanned
[separatists]{.underline}. [The prevailing logic, however, is based on a
hopeful theory]{.underline} of how they hope Putin will respond.
[Moscow's conduct over the three-and-a-half years of combat in Eastern
Ukraine, however, should lead to the **exact opposite conclusion** ---
when push comes to shove, the Russians have proven to be willing to
withstand the]{.underline} financial, political, and military [pain
associated with preventing the total military defeat of anti-Kiev
forces]{.underline}. Russian officials have, predictably, denounced
President Trump's [authorization of lethal equipment to the
Ukrainians]{.underline} --- including the likely delivery of Javelin
anti-tank weapons, which could pulverize Russian armor--- as an
aggressive act meant to deliberately sabotage the Minsk peace process.
While there is a possibility that Ukrainian forces could use
U.S.-supplied heavy weapons in an offensive capacity as the Russians
suggest, it is more likely that this assistance [will be used by Moscow
as an excuse to redouble its own support to Ukrainian proxies in Donetsk
and Luhansk]{.underline}. [The Russians have demonstrated in word and in
deed since]{.underline} they worked with proxies and invaded in April
2014 [that the Ukrainian government will not be permitted to win the
conflict]{.underline} militarily and reincorporate the Donbas into the
Ukrainian state. [In the fall of 2014 and the winter of 2015, when
Ukrainian troops and pro-government armed battalions were engaging
Moscow's proxies in ferocious]{.underline} door-to-door, house-to-house
[fighting, Russia escalated and forcefully stepped in,]{.underline}
supplying personnel, tanks, supplies, and reinforcements to beat back
Kiev's advances. [In Putin's mind, allowing Ukraine to retake strategic
territory was an **unthinkable prospect**]{.underline} that would lead
Kiev to believe that it could squash the rebellion militarily. The
infusion of Russian troops stopped Ukrainian territorial advances in
their tracks, at considerable human cost to Kiev. In other words,
[whenever pro-Russian militants were losing ground or at risk, **Moscow
turned on the** **spigot** of assistance to prevent a humiliating defeat
or retreat]{.underline}. This is one of the biggest reminders to the
world community that [Ukraine's political disposition is ultimately far
more important to Russia's strategic interests than it is to
Washington's]{.underline}. [No amount of U.S. military equipment or
heavy weapons systems is likely to eclipse what the Russians will
provide to the other side]{.underline}. [To believe Russia will be
intimidated into withdrawing]{.underline} its troops from Ukrainian
territory or suing for a peace with a government Moscow sees as a puppet
of the West [just because a few more of its soldiers have been killed is
to place **hope over the reality** of Putin's track record throughout
the war]{.underline}. Whether we in the United States or Western Europe
accept it as legitimate or not, [Putin is highly motivated to preserve
Russian influence and freedom of movement]{.underline} in a country that
shares a 1,426-mile border with the Russian Federation. [To allow
Ukraine to drift fully into Europe's orbit on his watch **would be
nothing short of a personal political humiliation for Putin and**, more
important, a **geopolitical catastrophe** for a Russia whose political
elites remain incredibly nervous about a shrinking Near Abroad and any
hint of political revolution in the former Soviet space]{.underline}.

### AT deterrence DA -- Baltics

#### Uniqueness overwhelms -- Russia won't launch a conventional attack in the Baltics 

**Stangl 19** -- a research assistant in the Department of Military &
Strategic Studies at the U.S. Air Force Academy. The views expressed are
those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the U.S.
Air Force Academy, U.S. Air Force, Department of Defense, or the U.S.
Government. (Maxwell, "Russia Won\'t Start a (Conventional) War in the
Baltics" National Interest, May 13, 2019,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-wont-start-conventional-war-baltics-57317>)//RP

Many leaders are worried that similar actions could be taken against the
Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Unlike Ukraine, these
three countries are a part of NATO, presenting a prime target for
Russian president Vladimir Putin. [However, future aggression will
likely come in the form of the hybrid warfare attacks]{.underline} as
seen in Ukraine and Georgia [rather than an all-out invasion like many
think.]{.underline} As Catherine Harris and Frederick Kagan from the
Institute for the Study of War have hinted at, "The Russian military is
well-positioned to launch a conventional war in Ukraine and a hybrid war
in the Baltic States, the opposite of what Western leaders seem to be
expecting in each theater." [**Russia is** simply **not prepared or
properly positioned to execute a** well-coordinated, **conventional
attack on the Baltics**]{.underline}. [The amount of Russian units in
close proximity to make a rapid assault is limited, and most of these
formations would take significant time and resources to
mobilize]{.underline}. [It would require a large and complex movement of
troops, vehicles, and equipment to successfully plan and execute such an
operation]{.underline}. Such activity would surely catch the eye of NATO
members, alerting them to a likely invasion. Instead, Russian posture is
best suited for hybrid warfare against these neighboring countries. A
Glimpse of the Bear With the Baltic States on Russia's Western border,
the Western Military District (WMD) \[Западный военный округ\] would be
ultimately responsible for Russian military operations in that region.
These districts are similar to the United States geographical combatant
commands such as European Command (EUCOM) and Central Command (CENTCOM),
which have separate units and command structures from multiple branches
across specific regions. Russia's WMD contains all units permanently
present in the western-most part of the country while also including the
enclave of Kaliningrad bordering Poland and Lithuania. Although it is
comprised of naval, air, ground, cyber, electronic, and nuclear
capabilities, [the number of assets in the region and their locations
simply do not lend themselves to making a surprise, conventional assault
on the Baltics]{.underline}. For instance, 2017 figures show that there
are twenty-two combat brigades and over 1,200 aircraft within the
vicinity of the Baltics, making it a very capable force. However, these
numbers do not tell the full story.

States]{.underline}," CATO Institute, 2/10/16,
<https://www.cato.org/blog/russia-wont-attack-baltic-states>, AS)

When the Cold War closed many people believed that history had ended.
Europe was certain to be free and undivided. Alas, it hasn't worked out
that way. But no worries. At least NATO officials are happy. [Following
Russian intervention in Georgia and Ukraine the alliance **rediscovered
a sense of purpose** through its old enemy, Moscow.]{.underline} The
Obama administration just announced a multi-billion dollar program to
bolster U.S. forces in Eastern Europe. Now a Rand Corporation report
warns that [Russia could easily overrun the three Baltic members of
NATO]{.underline} is raising additional alarm. Said David A. Shlapak and
Michael W. Johnson: the "unambiguous" result of a series of war games
was that "As currently postured, NATO cannot successfully defend the
territory of its most exposed members." The Rand researchers recommended
a substantial allied military presence to deter Moscow. Shalapak and
Johnson dismissed the cost, estimated at around \$2.7 billion annually,
but more commitments require more force structure, and that burden
almost certainly would fall upon America rather than the Europeans. Just
like the administration's new initiative for Eastern Europe involving a
single brigade. Their conclusion illustrates the folly years ago of
treating NATO as a social club and inducting new members which were
irrelevant to the continent's security and possessed minimal military
capabilities. Now the alliance realizes that it is obligated to war
against nuclear-armed Russia on behalf of essentially indefensible
countries. Equally striking is how NATO membership has discouraged the
Baltic nations from doing much for their own defense. Last year Latvia
and Lithuania devoted 1.06 percent and 1.14 percent, respectively, of
GDP to the military. Estonia was 2.04 percent---the first time Tallinn
met the official NATO standard. Yet [**the surging fear over Russian
adventurism is misplaced**. Vladimir Putin's behavior is bad, but poses
little threat to America, "old" Europe, or even most of Russia's
neighbors. He has taken Moscow back to the Russian Empire, not the
Soviet Union. His government demands respect for its status, protection
of Russia's borders, and consideration of its interests.]{.underline}
Mikhail Saakashvili's [Georgia was actively anti-Russian, pursued close
ties with America, and sought membership in NATO---all certain to
antagonize Moscow. Ukraine always mattered more to Moscow than Georgia
or the Baltics for historical and cultural reasons, as well as the naval
base of Sebastopol**. Putin acted only after Europe pushed a trade
agreement to reorient Ukraine away from Russia** and both Brussels and
Washington backed a street revolution against the elected president who
leaned toward Russia. Even then, Putin sought to weaken, not conquer,
Ukraine. His brutal response was]{.underline} murderous and unjustified,
but [militarily on par with U.S. interventions.]{.underline} Putin
continues to demonstrate no interest in ruling those likely to resist
Russia's tender mercies. [Seizing the Baltic states likely would
generate substantial popular resistance. Moreover, as weak nations
currently containing no foreign troops, the Baltics pose no potential
threat to Russia. Finally, the Baltic ethnic Russian
populations]{.underline}, though significant, [demonstrate little
sentiment for joining Mother Russia]{.underline}. They prefer cultural
connection to political affiliation, creating a poor target for the sort
of destabilizing tactics deployed against Ukraine. So what would Russia
gain from attacking the Baltics? A recalcitrant, majority non-ethnic
Russian population. A possible temporary nationalist surge at home. A
likely short-lived victory over the West. As I argue in National
Interest: "[The costs would be far greater. Grabbing the Baltics likely
would spur population exodus and trigger economic collapse. Launching a
war without the convincing pretext present in the cases of Georgia and
Ukraine might leave the Russian public angry over the retaliation
certain to come]{.underline}." Worse, [Moscow certainly would rupture
economic and political relations with the U.S. and Europe and probably
start a losing conventional war with NATO. Even more frightening would
be the prospect of a nuclear conflict.]{.underline} The U.S. should stop
making defense promises which serve the interests of other nations
rather than America. The Europeans should prepare their own defense.

#### No impact -- attacks would most likely involve hybrid warfare which won't escalate

Baltics" National Interest, May 13, 2019,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-wont-start-conventional-war-baltics-57317>)//RP

Hypothetically, if Russia were to conduct a combined-arms invasion of
the Baltic States tomorrow, **[only a small number of forces would be
properly positioned to attack]{.underline}**. There are plenty of
armored and mechanized units nearby, however, the only truly capable and
quick reaction military unit available for a surprise assault would be
the 76th Guards Air Assault Division (GAAD). Based in Pskov only twenty
miles from the border of Estonia, they could utilize cargo aircraft
(e.g. Il-76), and helicopters (e.g. Mi-8, Mi-17, and Mi-24) for airborne
operations, striking the Baltics with little warning. Additionally, it
is reported that the GAAD has recent combat experience in Ukraine. This
is an overlooked aspect when talking about the effectiveness of armed
forces. Size and equipment is not the only thing that determines a
unit's effectiveness. Recent tactical combat experience can also
increase lethality, something the GAAD now excels in. Although speed and
experience is great, especially [in a hypothetical Baltic
campaign]{.underline}, [these air assault units simply do not have the
heavy weaponry, equipment, or logistics to maintain an offensive posture
against NATO combat units]{.underline}. [They are outfitted for quick
and rapid deployments rather than sustained fighting with a superior
force such as a U.S. Army Armored Brigade Combat Team]{.underline}. To
counter this, Russia would have to mobilize their armored and mechanized
forces, turning the conflict into an even bigger conventional conflict,
something Putin knows would not fare well against American/NATO
airpower. Instead, [a more predictable, logical, and less risky approach
Russia might take would be utilizing hybrid warfare tactics]{.underline}
like they did against Ukraine in the Crimea and the Donetsk region. By
encouraging the ethnic Russian speaking populations within the three
Baltic countries to side with Russia, Putin could supply these break off
enclaves with weapons and equipment to sustain a secessionist
insurgency, like he did during the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008.
If necessary, the GAAD could provide very small, but direct support in a
feigned attempt to protect these ethnic Russians, as Russia did in the
2008 Georgian War. With their expeditionary capability to deliver rapid
firepower in proximity of the Baltics, the GAAD would be perfectly
positioned for this type of deployment. This form of warfighting would
undermine the stability and capability of a NATO country and possibly
the viability of the alliance in the long-term; precisely what Putin
seeks. So NATO is doomed in Eastern Europe? Not quite Direct or indirect
military confrontations are not the only way Russia could influence or
undermine the Baltic States. [Methods such as political, cyber,
information, and economic warfare have all been increasingly utilized by
Russia in the twenty-first century.]{.underline} They are the main
components of hybrid warfare. Russia could easily employ them with
maximum effort to degrade and/or disable the political and military
capabilities of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania---or any other neighboring
country for that matter.

Challenges from Within NATO Reviving American Leadership of the Alliance
[NATO's single greatest challenge is the **absence of strong, principled
American**]{.underline} presidential **[leadership]{.underline}** for
the first time in its history. President Donald [Trump is regarded
widely in NATO capitals as the Alliance's most urgent, and]{.underline}
often [most difficult, problem.]{.underline} NATO [leaders]{.underline},
for example, [considered not holding a 2019 summit to mark the
seventieth anniversary]{.underline} this spring as they did in decades
past. [They feared]{.underline} President [Trump would blow up a meeting
in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO leaders
during the past two years.]{.underline} Wary of his past behavior[, NATO
plans a scaled down leaders meeting]{.underline} for December 2019.
President [Trump's open ambivalence about NATO's value to the U.S., his
public questioning of America's Article 5 commitment to its allies,
persistent criticism of Europe's democratic leaders and embrace
of]{.underline} its [anti-democratic members and continued weakness in
failing to confront NATO's primary adversary]{.underline} President
Vladimir [Putin of Russia, have hurtled the Alliance into its **most
worrisome crisis** in memory]{.underline}.3 [There is no reason to
believe]{.underline} President [Trump's attitude will change for the
better]{.underline} during the next two years. [He believes NATO allies
are taking advantage of the U.S]{.underline}.4 These are the same allies
and partners who came to America's defense on 9/11, suffered more than
1,000 battlefield deaths alongside American soldiers in Afghanistan,5
are fighting with the U.S. now against the Islamic State and shoulder
the main burden sustaining a fragile peace in the Balkans, in both
Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. President Trump is the first U.S.
president to view the European Union as an economic competitor rather
than a vital partner of both the U.S. and NATO. [His troubling anti-NATO
and anti-Europe bias has caused European governments to question the
credibility of the U.S. as the leader of the West]{.underline} for the
first time since the Second World War.6 [The European public confidence
in American leadership i]{.underline}s also [at historically low
depths]{.underline}.7 Every American president before Trump has
encouraged the strength and unity of Europe as a core interest of the
U.S. [Trump may]{.underline} well [cause]{.underline} even [greater
damage to the Alliance while he remains in office]{.underline}. For this
reason, Republicans and Democrats in Congress must act together as a
blocking force against President Trump's dangerous policies. Congress,
on a bipartisan basis, should reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the
Article 5 defense clause in the NATO Treaty. Congress should pass
legislation this year requiring Congressional approval should President
Trump attempt to alter U.S. treaty commitments to NATO allies or to have
the U.S. leave the Alliance altogether.8 Congress should continue to
fund the "European Deterrence Initiative" to bolster U.S. military
strength in Europe that is the primary deterrent against Russian
adventurism.

Restoring European Defense Strength NATO's [European members and Canada
pose their own challenge to the Alliance---**the weakness of their
collective defense spending** for NATO's common defense]{.underline}.
President Trump has been right to push allies to spend more on defense.
He has the support of the U.S. Congress and many Americans in doing so.
[It is simply unfair that only five of the twenty-nine allies are
currently spending at least 2 percent of their]{.underline} Gross
Domestic Product [(GDP) on their military budgets, while the U.S. is
spending 3.5 percent and shouldering much of the defense
burden]{.underline}.9 [Germany]{.underline}, the largest and wealthiest
of the European allies, [has a major shortfall as it is currently
spending only 1.24 percent of its budget on defense.]{.underline} Its
coalition government has not summoned the strength and determination to
convince the Bundestag and the German public to reach the minimum 2
percent level soon. [Germany is thus abdicating this most basic
obligation as a member of NATO]{.underline}. [Italy, Canada, Spain, the
Netherlands and other allies are also spending well below the agreed 2
percent level]{.underline}.10 Having made his point, President Trump
should also acknowledge that aggregate NATO defense spending trends are
actually heading in the right direction, despite insufficient spending
by some allies. NATO allies have produced four consecutive years of real
growth for a collective increase in spending of \$87 billion,
particularly in reaction to Putin's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and
President Trump's public pressure since 2017.11 A majority of NATO
members plan to reach the 2 percent level by the agreed target date of
2024. More than half will spend 20 percent of their defense budgets on
new equipment and research and development.12 This new spending is
critical to produce added NATO defense capabilities, including
intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance, cyber and digital
technologies. The challenge for President Trump on NATO defense spending
is to pivot from chief critic to chief cheerleader. His administration
should also support new European Union efforts to strengthen the EU's
own defense capacity as long as it complements, and not duplicates,
NATO's existing capabilities and programs.

#### Trump wrecks NATO alliance

**Lutz 19** -- (Eric, "TRUMP PRIVATELY DISCUSSED DESTROYING NATO
ALLIANCE" Vanity Fair, January 15, 2019,
https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-privately-discussed-destroying-nato-alliance)//RP

President Donald [Trump has **long criticized the N**]{.underline}orth
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[T]{.underline}**reaty
**[O]{.underline}**rganization, [frequently bellyaching that the
international military partnership has been "very unfair" to the United
States, and castigating American allies as deadbeats for, in his eyes,
failing to pull their weight.]{.underline} However, it appears [Trump's
attacks on NATO are **more than bluster**]{.underline}. Citing senior
administration officials, The New York Times reported late Monday that
at several points in 2018, [**Trump discussed withdrawing the U.S.**
from the international organization, a move that would effectively doom
the 29-nation alliance and empower Russia, which has spent years seeking
to weaken it.]{.underline}

"It would destroy 70-plus years of painstaking work across multiple
administrations, Republican and Democratic, to create perhaps the most
powerful and advantageous alliance in history," Michèle A. Flournoy, an
under secretary of defense under Barack Obama, told the Times. "And it
would be the wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of."

To some extent, the news isn't all that surprising. [Trump has never hid
his disdain for international partnerships, and has maintained **rocky
relationships with critical American allies**, whom he constantly
accuses of taking advantage of the U.S.]{.underline} [During his
presidential campaign, **he described NATO** in]{.underline} particular
[**as "obsolete**," and admonished member nations in his two appearances
before the alliance]{.underline}. "NATO members must finally contribute
their fair share and meet their financial obligations," Trump told the
group in 2017. "This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the
United States. And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money
from past years and not paying in those past years."

Still, the revelation that [Trump wanted to leave the alliance
entirely---which neither the president nor the White House has
denied---is jarring.]{.underline} For seven decades, the partnership has
been a critical bulwark against Russia---and Moscow has long hoped to
see it unravel. A U.S. pullout would, without question, be a gift to
Putin. Senior administration officials, including former secretary of
defense Jim Mattis and National Security Adviser John Bolton, reportedly
worked to maintain the allyship after the president first told aides
that "he did not see the point of the military alliance." Other national
security officials have continued "internal and highly sensitive efforts
to preserve the military alliance," the Times reported.

[Of course, a great deal of **damage has already been done**. Trump's
tumultuous appearance at NATO last July bruised relationships with top
allies as he clashed with leaders and threatened to leave the
organization if they didn't capitulate to him. "]{.underline}He
[obviously has come to this meeting with the intention of **dividing the
alliance** and in creating a negative story he appeared to have no
interest in creating a positive outcome]{.underline}," former U.S.
ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns told my colleague Abigail Tracy at the
time. "Every president since Truman has thought of himself as the leader
of the NATO alliance. Trump obviously doesn't."

#### No commitment to NATO -- Trump and the administration has ruined European relationships 

**Rohac 6/21** -- research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute
(AEI), where he studies European political and economic trends.
Specifically, he is working on Central and Eastern Europe, the European
Union (EU) and the eurozone, US-EU relations, and the post-Communist

21, 2019.
https://www.aei.org/publication/lose-friends-alienate-allies)//RP

[If you're in doubt about the ill **health of the transatlantic
alliance**,]{.underline} consider that over the course of less than a
week[, **EU foreign ministers refused to side with the U**nited
**S**tates against Iran over an attack on an oil tanker in the Persian
Gulf,]{.underline} President [Trump lambasted the head of the European
Central Bank Mario Draghi on Twitter, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur
Ross threatened Europeans with tariffs on car imports.]{.underline}

Deeper drivers of this crisis predate the current administration. The
world has changed drastically since 1945 and the center of economic and
geopolitical power is shifting away from Europe. [The United States has
no choice but to adjust its foreign policy priorities accordingly. That
is why, as many have noted, **there will be no return to normalcy after
Trump** leaves office.]{.underline}

However, two elements of the current predicament are entirely avoidable:
[the president's bluster and the administration's lack of a coherent
strategy on key geopolitical challenges such as North Korea, Iran, and
China]{.underline}. [**Trump exasperates European leaders** by routinely
inserting himself into divisive European political conversations on
topics such as immigration, Brexit, crime rates in London, defense
spending, or Nigel Farage's career prospects]{.underline}. And on
subjects where the United States would be normally expected to lead,
allies are often left wondering about the administration's intentions.

The results are predictable. One, anti-American prejudices on the
continent are on the rise. According to a poll from last year, 55
percent of Germans said they viewed the United States as a threat (56
percent said the same thing about Russia). On issues such as Nord Stream
2---a pipeline from Russia to Germany that has drawn controversy as
tensions with Russia have heated up---the mere fact that the United
States is against its construction only complicates the political case
against it.

Two, [the lack of an intelligible U.S. foreign policy makes it
impossible for Europeans to stand united with America, even if they
wanted to]{.underline}. The French, for example, are under no illusions
about the character of Iran's regime---last year, after all, the
country's intelligence ministry unsuccessfully attempted a terror attack
in Paris. It seems a stretch to imagine that French intelligence would
have arrived at a dramatically different assessment of last week's
incident than the British or the Americans. Yet, playing hardball with
Tehran is perilous. Yes, it would risk jeopardizing the Iran deal that
the Europeans elevated to the status of a religious dogma. More
importantly, however, it would make Europeans liable for whatever
haphazard steps Trump happens to take next. The same logic applies to
Europe's relationship with China. As Ian Bond, a former British diplomat
put it, "if \[the Europeans\] exclude Huawei from their 5G networks,
only for Trump to reverse course, they risk Chinese retaliation and
commercial disadvantage."

How about NATO and increases in defense spending? Doesn't Trump deserve
credit for ending European 'free-riding'? Maybe, but whatever spending
increases Europeans made have come at the cost of making America appear
toxic. As a result, 72 percent of Germans now want their country's
foreign policy to be more independent of the United States.

[The debate about Europe's strategic autonomy is long
overdue]{.underline}. [But as of now, **there is no way that it can play
out without reducing U.S. influence on the continent, not to speak of
arms sales**---a point of particular salience for Trump]{.underline}. On
Monday for example, Germany, Spain and France concluded an agreement to
build a new generation of European fighter planes, the Future Combat Air
System.

[The administration made a disastrously wrong bet expecting Europe to
become more "Trumpy."]{.underline} The right-wing turn in the European
election has not materialized to the degree that some expected and the
future European Commission is bound to be as committed to the European
project and as circumspect of the United States as any that could have
been formed.

Trump's Washington is thus stuck with a small number of like-minded
populist governments in Europe: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and
Italy. But their influence in Europe is limited---and they also tend to
be fair-weather allies. A joint commitment to nationalism and
anti-immigration rhetoric, after all, is hardly a guarantee of shared
interests. Matteo Salvini's Italy happily signed up to China's Belt &
Road initiative, an infrastructure project that would better facilitate
trade between East Asia and Europe with highways, pipelines, and
railroads. Orban's Hungary acted against U.S. interests at numerous
junctures and actively cultivates an image of a country that is open to
engagement with Eastern autocracies. Poland might come the closest to
the platonic ideal of a populist and earnestly pro-U.S. government. But
that's one country among the EU's 28 (soon to be 27) members -- and one
that is holding an election in four months.

[If Trump's goal were to burn bridges and alienate America's European
friends, it is difficult to see how he could have improved upon the
current situation]{.underline}. [**An unequivocal commitment to NATO**
and the transatlantic partnership **was never an easy sell** in
Europe---not even in the best years of the alliance.]{.underline} Today,
to call oneself an Atlanticist in Brussels, Paris, or Berlin makes one
appear, in the best of cases, a hopeless eccentric. The administration
needs to remember that even in a world of "America First" and of
challenges [far beyond the confines of the North Atlantic, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs friends and allies. And
unless it changes course, it will]{.underline} soon lose its best and
most reliable ones.

[The Trump administration is]{.underline} in the midst of [making a
decision on whether to transfer lethal weaponry to Ukraine]{.underline}.
This potential move is intended to give Ukraine's military the ability
to impose new costs on the Russians and their proxies engaged in a
separatist revolt in the country's eastern region of Donbass, thereby
persuading the Kremlin to give up the fight. But [the result would
likely be]{.underline} the opposite --- [an escalation in the conflict
that would lead to further losses of Ukraine's territory and compromise
its political stability.]{.underline} [Russia enjoys insurmountable
military superiority over Ukraine. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should not encourage Ukraine to engage in an
escalatory confrontation with Russia]{.underline}. Washington knows full
well that Ukraine cannot prevail. The urge to give Ukraine lethal arms
--- most likely in the form of anti-tank weapons --- is understandable.
Since 2014, the Russians have occupied and illegally annexed Crimea and
sustained a separatist rebellion in Donbass that has claimed more than
10,000 lives. Moreover, Russia has engaged in these acts of aggression
in order to block Ukraine's desire to leave Moscow's sphere of influence
and join the community of Western democracies. Under these
circumstances, the United States should continue helping Ukrainians
defend themselves by assisting with defense reforms and training
Ukrainian forces. So why not take the next step and give Ukraine lethal
weapons? For starters, the notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin
would give up his hold on Donbass if a few more Russians come home in
body bags is to dramatically misread the Kremlin. Putin is a master at
manipulating the Russian public, especially when it comes to the Ukraine
conflict and would hardly fold his hand if Russian casualties were to
increase. On the contrary, [he would likely double down, blaming the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and Ukraine [for the
intensified fighting and taking steps to offset]{.underline} the
[improvement in Ukraine's military capability]{.underline}. The Russians
have so far effectively countered Ukrainian military successes --- in
some instances, retaliating with devastating effect. When Ukrainian
forces in the summer of 2014 advanced into Donbass and took the
strategically located city of Ilovaisk, Putin promptly called in his own
crack troops, which quickly decimated the Ukrainian unit that had taken
the town. Should Putin decide to escalate in response to a U.S. decision
to transfer lethal weapons to Ukraine, Washington would have few arrows
in its quiver. Even if the Trump administration were to take another
step up the ladder of escalation, Russia would go at least one step
further. Russia shares a 1500-mile land/sea border with Ukraine, making
the Kremlin far more invested in the fate of Ukraine than Washington.
Russia has greater interest in putting skin in the game. [Rather than
playing to Russia's principal strength]{.underline} --- its military
advantage over Ukraine -- [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should continue to play to Russia's]{.underline} main
[vulnerability]{.underline} --- its economic weakness. [On this front,
**the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**and** its
**European allies**]{.underline}, not the Kremlin, [**hold the
cards**.]{.underline} The loss of income due to the low price of fossil
fuels and the international sanctions imposed in response to its
aggression in Ukraine have taken a serious toll on the Russian economy.
Keeping sanctions in place and, if necessary, increasing them, is the
West's best source of leverage for pushing Russia to a diplomatic
solution. Congress seems to realize as much, having just imposed on the
White House legislation tightening U.S. sanctions against Russia.
[**Sending lethal weapons** to Ukraine has one further downside --- it
**would cause a rift between the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**and** its main **European
allies**]{.underline}. [**Germany and France** have been leading
diplomatic efforts to find a diplomatic solution for Donbass --- and
both **have long opposed sending lethal weapons** to Ukraine because of
its potential to escalate the conflict]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Europe have moved in lock
step since the beginning of the conflict, closely coordinating
non-lethal military]{.underline} [assistance to Ukraine]{.underline} as
well as economic sanctions against Russia. [**Transatlantic solidarity**
has arguably been the West's strongest suit,]{.underline} [confronting
Putin with a united front and keeping Russia in the penalty
box]{.underline} despite pressure from parties on both sides of the
Atlantic to drop sanctions and reap the accompanying commercial
benefits. [Europeans are already on edge due to Congress's recent
sanctions legislation, which imposes measures not coordinated with the
European Union]{.underline} and that have the potential to cause undue
harm to European companies. If Washington decides to head off on its own
and send lethal weapons to Ukraine, solidarity on Ukraine may well come
to end. Putin has been working hard to achieve just this end.
[Washington would be making a serious strategic mistake if it hands to
the Kremlin the transatlantic bust-up for which Moscow has long been
hoping.]{.underline} The conflict in Ukraine promises to poison Russia's
relations with the West until a diplomatic resolution is reached. But
[sending lethal weapons to Ukraine is a recipe for military escalation
and **transatlantic discord**]{.underline}. The best way to bring peace
to Ukraine is through transatlantic unity aimed at maintaining Russia's
political and economic isolation until it makes a deal at the
negotiating table.

<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-lethal-aid-cant-help-ukraine-22114)//RP>

In Thursday, weeks after rumors swirled around Washington that the State
Department and Pentagon want the president to arm Ukraine, Secretary of
Defense James Mattis confirmed that the White House is considering
sending weapons to the country. President Trump should reject any such
proposal. The United States already has devoted \$750 million to Ukraine
with little to show for it. [Providing lethal aid will escalate tensions
with Russia and **contradict NATO allies** who prefer to solve the
conflict diplomatically.]{.underline} U.S. aid has come through the
European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), which was launched in 2014 in
response to the Russian incursion into Ukraine. In fiscal year 2015, ERI
included a \$175 million transfer fund that was shared among Ukraine and
the three Baltic States. Similarly, the fiscal year 2017 ERI request
included \$5.6 million "to develop a sustainable Ukraine (UKR) Special
Operations Force Generation model." ERI spending is unlikely to stop
there---the latest ERI proposal requests \$150 million for Ukraine "to
continue train, equip and advise efforts to build Ukraine's capacity to
conduct internal defense operations." And what advancements has Ukraine
made with millions of dollars in U.S. benevolence? Not much. U.S.
assistance often has been of little utility. Reuters reported in
December that \$12 million worth of Raven RQ-11B drones were hacked by
Russian equipment, rendering them useless and even dangerous for
Ukrainian troops. Hackers even used the drones to spy on Ukrainian
military positions. Despite these shortcomings, U.S. troops were still
training Ukrainian soldiers to use these drones as of this spring. The
United States also sent Humvees to Ukraine in 2015, but the vehicles
dated from the 1980s and 1990s. Some arrived with plastic doors and
windows, providing almost zero protection to soldiers. Others broke down
after being driven a few hundred kilometers, reportedly "the result of
sitting in a warehouse too long." Sending more weapons would not improve
the situation. [Relations between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Russia are]{.underline} already [at a low
point. Sending new weapons to Ukraine would only escalate
tensions]{.underline}---an all risk, no reward proposition for the
United States. What's more, [Russia remains a powerful, nuclear-armed
state, and disturbing one of its core strategic interests is
unwise]{.underline} and could make the conflict bloodier. In other
words, [Russia boasts]{.underline} what scholars call ["escalation
dominance" over Ukraine]{.underline}, [meaning Moscow]{.underline}
always [will possess a stronger, larger military than
Ukraine]{.underline}. New weapons are unlikely to change the calculus in
the conflict. Moreover, Russia always will have a greater interest in
Ukraine than the United States. Ukraine is not only in Russia's
backyard, but was historically part of the Russian Empire, and later the
Soviet Union. Given that "Russian leaders believe their country's core
strategic interests are at stake in Ukraine; they are unlikely to give
ground," even if the United States tries to bleed Russia by attrition.
Of course, [some supporters of the]{.underline} Trump administration's
[plan say it is "meant to deter aggressive actions by Moscow," **but
deterrence already has failed**]{.underline}. The Ukrainians could not
keep the Russians out of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk. Thus, the Russian
and "separatist" presence there is already an accomplished fact. What
supporters really mean is that they want to compel Russia, but we don't
know exactly what they want to compel Russia to do. To be sure, [the
departure of Russian troops would not solve the myriad problems Ukraine
still must overcome]{.underline}; for example, what to do about Crimea
or how to placate dissatisfied eastern provinces. There is no military
solution in Ukraine, as these sorts of problems are best solved by
diplomacy. Moreover, [**Ukraine is not a member of NATO**, and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is not obligated to come to
its aid]{.underline}. Ukraine must consider other solutions. [**Giving
lethal aid** to Ukraine could]{.underline} also [put the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [in an **awkward position
vis-à-vis its NATO allies**.]{.underline} Importantly, [NATO allies like
France and Germany acknowledge the Russian point of view about arming
Ukraine, and hav]{.underline}e previously [said]{.underline} that
[providing Ukraine with lethal weaponry would constitute a "dangerous,
permanent escalation" against Russia]{.underline}. Indeed, France and
Germany are still calling for a negotiated solution as of last month,
and "German, French, and other Western European defense ministers did
not attend" events during Mattis's trip to Ukraine. It is unclear how
lethal aid would accelerate a diplomatic outcome. Although the conflict
in Ukraine is a tragedy, the United States can do little. Furthermore,
Ukraine's security has little to do with the fundamental safety of the
United States. President [Trump]{.underline} should not send lethal aid
to Ukraine, and [should avoid further entangling the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [into this conflict.]{.underline}

#### Selling arms is worse for NATO

\-\--it's worse for NATO, and US weapons are key because Putin wants to
show he can defeat US-designed equipment

University where he is Director of the Arneson Institute for Practical
Politics and heads the International Studies Program (Sean, "THE
ESCALATION ADVOCATES ARE WRONG ON UKRAINE," *War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/the-escalation-advocates-are-wrong-on-ukraine/)//BB>

[Russia remains parked in Ukraine's east where Moscow-backed separatists
continue to create mayhem]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the western allies
are maintaining a general consensus that has led to the political
isolation of Russia, the slow ramping up of economic sanctions, and the
symbolic but important reassurance of nervous eastern European members
of NATO -- accomplishments trumpeted by President Barack Obama in the
State of the Union address. [The]{.underline} recent [increase in the
Russian presence in eastern Ukraine is reason for reviewing
options]{.underline}. [The problem is that, given the risks]{.underline}
involved, [the only realistic and thus most likely effective option is
long-term, patient resolve to stay the course]{.underline}.
[Nevertheless, there is a growing chorus in the United States that
believes the next steps should be to send military aid to Ukraine. This
would be a risky gamble at this time, not worth the potential
dangers]{.underline}. [The United States and Europe hold overwhelming
political, economic, and military advantages over Russia]{.underline}.
Russia, in fact, grows weaker by the day --as made evident by the recent
S&P downgrade of Russian credit to "junk" level. Russia is fundamentally
weak in terms of its unsustainable long-term force projection and the
erosion of its economy. [However, Russia does not need to apply much
pressure to keep Ukraine destabilized enough to maintain significant
leverage over Kiev's future alignments]{.underline}; [one should
anticipate this standoff lasting for some time. It is unclear how adding
fuel to the fire would help]{.underline}. As Matt O'Brien wrote recently
in The Washington Post: Russia, in other words, is doomed as long as oil
is cheap and sanctions are in place. It could survive either alone. But
together, they destroy Russia's economy and its ability to borrow to
cover that up. And unlike, say, 2008, when oil prices rebounded rather
quickly, this crisis could last awhile. After all, if you think Putin is
going to back down in Ukraine anytime soon, well, think again: he's
already pushed pro-peace oligarchs who've lost a lot of money the past
year to his outer circle, if that. In other words, [this crisis requires
strategic thinking and patience, not tit-for-tat tactical reactions
which are insufficient to achieve a balance of power in eastern Ukraine
and unlikely to foster a diplomatic resolution]{.underline}. Yet
momentum, at least in Washington, is moving in the opposite direction:
the assumption appears to be that it is [America]{.underline}'s job to
fix the problems of eastern Ukraine, even if that [risks escalating the
conflict]{.underline}. [Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO]{.underline}, Ivo
[Daalder]{.underline}, last week [argued]{.underline} that, "...Mr.
Putin will settle only when the costs of continuing the war are too
high. [Supplying arms to Ukraine will raise the costs to Russia,
increasing the likelihood that a real settlement can be
negotiated]{.underline}. The time for doing so is now." Former Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in recent Senate testimony said, "Our
support for Ukraine must enhance its security capabilities and support
the new government's ambitious reforms, because Ukraine will need to
restore security and implement dramatic economic changes to emerge from
the current crisis." Strobe [Talbott and Steven Pifer of the Brookings
Institution insisted, "Washington needs to do more to get Russia to
change course. That means giving the Ukrainian military sufficient means
to make further aggression so costly that Putin and the Russian army are
deterred from escalating the fight]{.underline}." They call for \$3
billion to be allocated over three years to support Ukrainian defense
efforts by providing lethal but defensive military equipment to the
Ukrainians (which would somehow come to operate without Americans
needing to be there). They also argue that, the United States should
garner commitments within NATO for more military equipment for Ukraine.
Strobe Talbott and Steven Pifer are contributors to a longer joint study
by the Brookings Institution, the Atlantic Council, and the Chicago
Council on Global Affairs. Their report details the argument for the
United States to provide lethal defensive equipment to Ukraine. What is
notable about this report is the number of Democratic Party national
security luminaries who signed it: Michele Flournoy, a likely choice for
Secretary of Defense should Hillary Clinton win the White House; Jan
Lodal, a senior defense department official during Bill Clinton's
presidency; and Ivo Daalder, a former advisor to President Obama, U.S.
Permanent Representative on the NATO Council, and a veteran of the
Clinton National Security Council. Former SACEUR Admiral James Stavridis
(ret.) and Dean of The Fletcher School also lent his considerable weight
to the report along with General Charles Wald (ret.), former deputy
commander of U.S. European Command, and John Herbst, a former ambassador
to Ukraine and Uzbekistan. As these proposals rolled out, NATO Deputy
Secretary General, Alexander Vershbow, also a former senior American
diplomatic and defense official, and a primary architect of NATO
enlargement, visited Tblisi, Georgia last week and tweeted, "All tools
in place to help #Georgia move from #NATO partnership to membership. W/
necessary political commitment, I'm sure it will happen." [These
tactical responses to Putin's reckless behavior are well-intended, but
risk producing **dangerous outcomes** for the United States while doing
little to change the situation in Ukraine]{.underline}. [It would take
time to adequately equip and train Ukrainian armed forces in an
impactful way]{.underline} -- even with relatively modest items like
counter-battery radars and anti-tank missiles. [Advancing weapons into
Ukraine is precisely the kind of evidence that Putin wrongly says
justifies his illegal actions]{.underline}. [There is every reason to
believe that Russia would respond not with negotiation, but perhaps with
more, and even **deadlier**, **war**.]{.underline} NATO allies in Europe
will also consider how Russia might react and will likely not be as
bullish as escalation advocates hope. Indeed, already on Monday, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled her opposition to this approach
saying: "Germany will not support Ukraine with weapons. I am convinced
this conflict cannot be solved by military means." If anything,
[American delivery of military equipment to Ukraine could]{.underline}
actually [serve to take European allies off the hook for playing their
role in further isolating Russia, opting to let the United States pay
the price and take the risks]{.underline}. Consequently, [the United
States risks undermining existing consensus in NATO and the European
Union by putting military aid to Ukraine on the agenda]{.underline}.
Already there are frays over who contributes and pays for the new NATO
reinforcement spearhead force announced this last September. **[Holding
NATO and EU consensus steady]{.underline}** while collating power
advantages with patience [is]{.underline} **[perhaps the most
significant strategic need at this time]{.underline}**. Fundamentally,
none of these proposals for military escalation address what Ukraine
truly needs -- tens of billions of dollars of guaranteed loans to
cushion destabilizing but necessary economic reforms. No one, it seems,
is lining up to write that check. Flournoy told The New York Times, "One
of the best ways to deter Russia from supporting the rebels in taking
more territory and [stepping up the conflict]{.underline} is to increase
the cost that the Russians or their surrogates would incur." The
assumptions-behind this national security thinking [completely ignore
the alternative outcome or what comes next]{.underline} -- [that this
approach is precisely the trigger that provokes a **dramatic
escalation** by Russia]{.underline}. [This thinking also indicates a
belief that, in effect, if America leads on this, the other NATO allies
will fall in line]{.underline}. [One can certainly hope]{.underline}
these things will happen -- [but hope is not the basis of sound
strategy.]{.underline} Even if the military assistance contemplated
achieved an elusive balance of power in eastern Ukraine, given the
higher degree of Russian interests in the region, [there is every reason
to think Moscow would see this as a challenge to overcome American
technology, **challenging America's credibility and that of
NATO**]{.underline}. What, then, is the plan? Speaking at a recent
Senate hearing, Henry Kissinger said, "I'm uneasy about beginning a
process of military engagement without knowing where it will lead us and
what we'll do to sustain it...I believe we should avoid taking
incremental steps before we know how far we are willing to go." He
added, "This is a territory 300 miles from Moscow, and therefore has
special security implications." Kissinger's views accurately explain the
situation and why escalation carries dangers not worth the costs -- at
least as the situation now stands. Regrettably, in the debates over
Ukraine and Russia too much time is spent arguing about what should be
done, and not enough time is spent understanding what is actually
driving the interests of the states involved -- including that of
America and its allies in Europe. [Advocates of escalation in Ukraine
are sustaining a respectable and logical extension of a worldview that
governed the last two decades of American policy towards
Europe]{.underline}, which culminated in the false promises of NATO's
2008 declaration that Ukraine and Georgia would one day join NATO. [That
worldview, however, ran into the ditch in eastern Ukraine]{.underline}
last March. [Military escalation at this time would entangle America in
a conflict adjacent to a declining, paranoid, and nuclear-armed
Russia]{.underline}. [What Russia has done in eastern Ukraine is
unacceptable]{.underline} and the Russian people will eventually look
back and wonder what their "leadership" was thinking. [Now, however, is
not the time to risk making a bad situation even worse by launching
America onto a slippery slope **of dangerous military
escalation**]{.underline}.

#### Lethal weapons [destroy]{.underline} NATO alliances -- result in heightened Ukraine and Russian tensions which forces draw-in

President Obama said that he would wait to see whether the diplomatic
offensive of the German chancellor and the French president achieves any
success. However, he added that[, "if, in fact, diplomacy fails, what
I've asked my team to do is to look at all options---what other means
can we put in place to change Russian President Vladimir Putin's
calculus---and the possibility of lethal defensive weapons is one of
those options."]{.underline} Some believe that the "hard" fall-back
position sponsored by Washington can reinforce the "soft" approach
preferred by the Europeans. [I tend to doubt the effectiveness of the
threat of military aid to Ukraine. Not to mention the risks, which are
enormous.]{.underline} As my colleague Jeremy Shapiro has written, I
also believe U.S.-provided lethal arms may "fail to induce a Russian
retreat and instead cause an escalation of the war." [The higher
strategic stakes, historic and cultural ties, and geographic proximity
all give Moscow an intrinsic advantage in case such escalation takes
place]{.underline}---an actuality that my other Brookings colleagues
Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy have described as [Putin's "**escalation
dominance**" in Ukraine. The emerging transatlantic differences in
approaches to curb Russia's aggression against Ukraine should not be
overlooked in Washington]{.underline}. Nor should they be papered over,
as President Obama did in his response to a journalist's question that
"there may be some areas where there are tactical disagreements; there
may not be." [Russia has proven itself adept at leveraging these
differences and utilizing them to its advantage.]{.underline} [If
Russia's actions have reinforced transatlantic unity, as Obama
maintains, then European and American leaders must speak and act with
coordination and coherence.]{.underline} Their policies should converge
in: Conducting hard negotiations with Putin in small multilateral
circles; Modulating the pressure of economic sanctions; Generously
helping the troubled Ukrainian economy (as Daniel Wolfe and others
suggest); while Honestly declaring that Kiev's entry in NATO is not "à
l'ordre du jour." A corollary for my American friends, in discussing
costs and burden sharing: please appreciate the fact that sanctions are
already costing the European economies far more than any conceivable
**[supply of "lethal"]{.underline}** or "non-lethal" [**defensive
weapons to the Ukrainian military would cost** the United States and its
**NATO allies.**]{.underline} It's also worth noting the heavy toll that
Europeans would be required to pay if American-supplied weapons and
technology foment a full-fledged war on Europe's doorstep.

#### Arms sales alienate NATO

**Ashford 15** -- PhD @ UVA (Emma, "Don't Raise the Stakes in Ukraine,"
<https://www.cato.org/blog/dont-raise-stakes-ukraine)//BB>

[The arguments made]{.underline} in the report, cosponsored by
Brookings, the Atlantic Council and The Chicago Council on Global
Affairs - [seem compelling on the surface. The authors argue that the
provision of lethal]{.underline}, but solely defensive, [weapons would
better allow Ukrainian troops to defend themselves]{.underline} against
continuing attacks from pro-Russian rebels. As the evidence indicates
that the rebels themselves are being supplied with advanced weapons from
Moscow, American weapons would place Ukrainian forces on a more even
footing. The report further asserts that such weaponry could raise the
continued costs of backing the rebels for Moscow, bringing Vladimir
Putin to the negotiating table. Unfortunately, arming Ukraine will cause
more problems than it solves. Certainly, such a move would be a
propaganda coup for Russia, which has already been using state media to
perpetuate the idea that NATO is involved in the crisis. Russian media
is extremely good at blurring key facts to make a coherent, anti-Western
narrative, even if the narrative itself is fundamentally false. It won't
matter than the weapons are 'defensive' in nature; the Russian media can
spin this to bolster their arguments that Ukraine's government is
illegitimate and that the conflict is being driven by NATO. It could
even increase popular support for the war among the Russian population.
[Arming Ukraine will]{.underline} also [shift U.S. policy **further
away** from that of European allies]{.underline}. Although the report's
authors note that [many European states]{.underline} could also be
encouraged to provide weapons, several key states [have already weighed
in against such a move]{.underline}. Just yesterday, German Chancellor
Angela [Merkel told reporters: "Germany will not support Ukraine with
weapons]{.underline}... I am convinced that this conflict cannot be
solved militarily." [**Differentiating the U.S. response from that of
European leaders** will only provide more ammunition for Russian
dissension, further minimizing the likelihood of a diplomatic
settlement]{.underline}. Logistical problems abound. Compatibility may
be a major problem given Ukraine's primarily Soviet and post-Soviet
armaments. Timing is another concern: although the report suggests that
the U.S. could use current stocks of weapons, it may be logistically
impossible to get large quantities of arms to Ukraine, or complete any
necessary training, in time for the likely spring offensive by
pro-Russian rebels. Even if these problems were overcome, the assumption
that weapons will help Ukrainian forces is itself problematic. The
Ukrainian army is poorly trained, and would likely require expert
support and training from U.S. personnel. The integration of volunteer
units into fighting forces is patchy, and corruption remains a problem.
Even with U.S. weapons, there is effectively no prospect of a Ukrainian
military triumph. This brings us to the fundamental problem with the
report: an assumption that if Western states can simply raise the costs
of conflict high enough, Vladimir Putin will fold under domestic
pressure. Raising the costs of conflict for Russia will necessarily
increase in the violence in the Donbas. The conflict is already bloody,
with thousands of military and civilian casualties. While the Russian
government has shown some sensitivity to the costs of the conflict --
i.e., casualty numbers are being effectively hidden from the Russian
people -- it is still extremely unlikely that Putin, who has in large
part staked his domestic credibility on this confrontation, will back
down. If he does not, the West has little comeback. [Arming Ukraine
won't help to secure military victory]{.underline}, and will not
encourage Vladimir Putin to back down. At best, it may help Ukraine to
better withstand rebel attacks. But [doing so comes at a very high
cost]{.underline}, giving Russia additional propaganda material and
**[driving a wedge between Europe and the United States]{.underline}**.
Worse, it raises the stakes in Ukraine, and will likely serve to
increase, not decrease the bloodshed. Let's hope the White House
continues to take a pragmatic approach to the crisis, and resists the
temptation to arm Ukraine.

### AT allies -- NATO - ! d

#### NATO is [ineffective]{.underline} -- UN fills in, no common threat assessment and lack of shared responsibility

Universiteit Antwerpen, Belgium. (Tom, "Take It from a European: NATO Is
Obsolete" February 22, 2017. National Interest.

The recent visit by Secretary of Defense James Mattis to NATO allies
does not erase the fact that, as a presidential candidate and
president-elect, Donald [Trump stated on many occasions that NATO is
obsolete]{.underline}. It is a bigger problem than just burden sharing.
Trump's key message is that the world has changed to the detriment of
the United States, and that NATO no longer fits comfortably into this
new world order. Of course, the United States will not withdraw from the
organization, but [NATO will get less attention from the Oval Office in
the coming years.]{.underline} That is for sure. [For those in Europe
who care about the alliance, this is a nightmare. But instead of
clinging to the past, they should wake up. The world]{.underline} today
[is]{.underline} indeed [**fundamentally different** from the one we
happen to know, and]{.underline} [certainly from the times into which
NATO was born]{.underline}. It is indeed bizarre that NATO is still
alive. [Defense alliances are]{.underline}, by definition,
[temporary]{.underline}. [Realists do not believe in long-term
structural cooperation between states, and certainly not in the field of
security]{.underline}. At most, s[tates can try to cooperate in an
alliance on a short-term basis to defeat a common enemy,]{.underline}
like during the two world wars and during the Cold War. [Once the enemy
is gone, alliances have no meaning]{.underline} anymore. It was on this
basis that John Mearsheimer and many others predicted the end of the
alliance after the end of the Cold War. The implosion of the Warsaw Pact
and the USSR itself should, indeed, have led to the demise of NATO. It
did not. The least bad explanation is organizational inertia. [NATO
tried to adapt to the changed circumstances by finding new enemies:
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, "rogue states," failed
states, ethnic conflicts]{.underline} (as in the Balkans)
[and]{.underline}, later on, [terrorism]{.underline}. It is not
difficult to come up with real or imagined dangers. But [states do not
need to be part of a militarily integrated organization to protect
oneself against]{.underline} these kind of [minor threats.]{.underline}
[Collective defense organizations]{.underline}, based on the premise of
"an attack on one is an attack on all," [are established to defend
oneself against an attack by a major power]{.underline}: Germany in
1914, Germany and Japan in the first half of the 1940s, the USSR during
the Cold War, and maybe China in the future. Not for peacekeeping.
[Collective defense organizations are not the best match for threats
like terrorism and ethnic conflicts]{.underline}. For countering
terrorism, coalitions of the willing will do. [For managing ethnic
conflicts, collective security organizations (like the **UN** and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) **should take the
lead,** both for peacemaking and peacekeeping.]{.underline} Collective
security organizations regulate the use of force amongst its member
states, and they are---in contrast to collective defense
organizations---not meant to serve against an external enemy. Because
NATO stepped in for these collective security tasks, organizations like
the UN and the OSCE got sidetracked. [**NATO's** post--Cold War **track
record is dismal**, which is not surprising, given the nature of the
beast]{.underline}. Apart from the Balkans, which are more or less
stable (although tensions are flaring up again these days), [the NATO
military interventions in Afghanistan and Libya are a complete
failure.]{.underline} [Thirteen and six years after NATO\'s
intervention]{.underline}, respectively, these [states have hardly
stabilized]{.underline}. On the contrary, Afghanistan and Libya are
breeding places for terrorists. Again, this should not come as a
surprise, because collective defense organizations are not meant for
carrying out peace-building operations. The biggest mistake, however,
was NATO expansion. [It is hard to refute the thesis that **the Ukraine
crisis is the result of interference by NATO** and the EU in Russia's
spheres of influence.]{.underline} A red line was crossed, in the eyes
of Moscow, and Russia had repeatedly made that position clear in
advance. NATO expansion also contradicted Western promises. On the basis
of these oral guarantees, in February 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev gave the
green light for German reunification talks. And what did the West do?
Expand NATO. Not just once, but twice. At the NATO Summit in Bucharest
in 2008, President Bush even pushed through (against the wishes of the
Europeans) a third extension, namely the promise to include Georgia and
Ukraine into NATO. What did he expect Russia would do? Just take notice
and agree? More fundamentally, the West made the mistake after the end
of the Cold War not to include Russia into the Euro-Atlantic security
architecture on an equal basis. Contrary to positive examples in 1815
and 1945, the loser of the Cold War was left alone. Instead of replacing
NATO with a regional collective security organization, the West kept
NATO artificially in existence---and Russia in the dark. Ironically, the
Baltic states, which wanted to feel more secure by becoming NATO
members, are now feeling less secure. All this was predicted in the
1990s by foreign-policy giants like George Kennan and Paul Nitze.
Currently, [there is a major split among the twenty-eight NATO member
states: those in the south worry about migration and ISIS]{.underline},
but are relaxed with respect to Russia; [those in the east]{.underline}
are relaxed about ISIS, but [worry about Russia. There is **no common
threat assessment**]{.underline}. In addition, tensions between member
states (Turkey and Greece) and within member states (Poland and Hungary)
are rising. It would be shortsighted to keep relying on NATO now because
of the worsening relationship with Russia. [A fundamental break with the
past is needed, and the Trump administration provides an ideal
opportunity]{.underline}. Until recently, the Europeans liked to hide
behind American leadership, and not only with respect to burden sharing.
Although European states spend on average much less on defense than the
United States, the combined European defense budget is \$250 billion,
which is three and a half times more than Russia's. The difference in
defense spending between the United States and Europe says more about
the United States than about Europe. [More problematic is the **lack of
shared responsibility.**]{.underline} [It is indeed strange that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had to intervene in the
Balkans in the 1990s. The flipside was that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [was the one that pulled the ropes inside NATO. The
Europeans had to live with NATO expansion and U.S. missile defense in
Europe]{.underline}, for instance. The Europeans were always skeptical,
but when push came to shove, they gave in to the Americans. Now, for the
first time ever, we have an American president who calls NATO obsolete.
European leaders should now get their act together and agree with this
assessment, for the many reasons mentioned above. There has never been a
better external opportunity to strengthen European foreign, security and
defense policy. In a world without NATO, the Europeans have no escape
from taking up more responsibilities. In addition, NATO should be
transformed, or even be replaced by a new Eurasian-Atlantic collective
security organization that includes Russia. That will also be in the
interest of Ukraine and the Baltic states. The newly built headquarters
for NATO in Brussels, which will be inaugurated in the presence of
President Trump at the end of May, is large enough to fit them all.

#### NATO is [obsolete]{.underline} -- counterproductive military interventions and a lack of focus on pressing threats prove

IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND transition to power, President Donald [Trump has
repeatedly sent tremors through the commanding heights of the U.S.
national security establishment]{.underline}. Recently, [he]{.underline}
again [attacked the NATO alliance, calling it \"obsolete,\" because NATO
was not set up to respond to terrorist threats, and]{.underline}
reminding the world that the [allies free-ride off U.S. military efforts
by not bearing their fair share of the burden]{.underline}.
Embarrassingly, [Trump is right on both counts. Establishment
figures]{.underline} such as former Ambassador Nicholas Burns often try
to [refute]{.underline} both of [these points by arguing]{.underline}
that [the only time the Article V]{.underline} mutual defense clause of
the NATO treaty [has ever been invoked was after]{.underline} the
[9/11]{.underline} attacks, and that NATO troops have fought and died in
Afghanistan going after al-Qaida terrorists and their Taliban hosts.
Never mind that [the real reason]{.underline} the [allies eagerly
invoked Article V]{.underline} after 9/11 [was to show that the alliance
was a two-way street, given the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[alone accounts for]{.underline} about [75 percent of the military
spending of the 28-country alliance]{.underline}. The fact is, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates really [didn\'t need the
allies\' limited military capabilities.]{.underline} With incompatible
equipment and an abundance of restrictions on the use of their forces,
some [American personnel]{.underline} actually [complained that the
allies]{.underline} simply [got in the way]{.underline}. Per usual they
mostly provided international political cover for a U.S.-dominated
military operation. In addition, although ousting the Taliban regime and
killing Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders may have been needed,

**[NATO expansion has fueled some of Russia's worst fears...and
impulses]{.underline}**. What happens now

Following the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, the United States moved to fill the security vacuum left in the
post--communist space. It brought former Warsaw Pact states and Soviet
republics into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and was
public about its intentions to expand the Alliance even further to the
east. American aid agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
provided political and financial support to elements in Russia's
so-called "near abroad" not willing to follow Moscow's lead.

One can argue that the United States' intentions were noble. American
officials feared that if their country turned its back on Eastern
Europe, then Russia would reemerge from its state of post--Cold War
disarray and reassert its military might over its former satrapies.
Almost thirty years later, Russia has largely recovered from the
post--Soviet economic depression that it endured and is looking to
reestablish its traditional security mechanisms in Europe. [The United
States' efforts to keep the peace in the former Soviet space were
arguably a failure]{.underline}. [American officials now look to
compensate for their shortcomings by getting more involved in the region
whether it be by levying economic sanctions on Russia or providing
weapons to its neighbors]{.underline}. However, few in Washington would
argue that these failures occurred because of the United States doing
too much in Russia's near abroad.

[**Few American officials** recognized **the security concerns** that
would develop in Moscow **if NATO expanded**]{.underline}. Some outright
dismissed Russia's worries about "NATO encirclement" by correctly citing
that the United States withdrew the majority of its military forces from
Europe in the years following the Cold War. [However, such **thinking
overlooks** other concerns held by the Kremlin]{.underline}. As it
withdrew conventional troops, the United States exited the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002 and promised the
establishment of a ballistic-missile defense (BMD) system in Europe
which would leave Russia vulnerable in the event of nuclear war.

Alliance expansion into the near abroad also empowered some of the most
historically anti-Russian elements in that region---Ukrainian
Banderites, Polish nationalists, Balkan Islamists. American-led regime
change efforts against Middle Eastern governments in Iraq, Libya, and
Syria greatly concerned Russia given their empowerment of jihadist
forces, and, for the longest time, the Russian Empire and the USSR
considered Western Asia to be in their sphere of influence as explained
by British historian Christopher Andrew and KGB defector Vasiliy
Mitrokhin in The World Was Going Our Way.

Fear of foreign intervention is a longstanding Russian historical
concern. "At bottom of \[the\] Kremlin's neurotic view of world affairs
is \[a\] traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity," wrote
George F. Kennan, father of the Cold War-era containment doctrine, in
his famous Long Telegram. "Whereas the West sees Russia's fear of
invasion as groundless, history has shown Russian leaders that foreign
intentions are typically hidden or fluid. Each age brings a new
existential threat; there would always be another Napoleon or Hitler,"
writes Benn Steil in Foreign Policy.

Russia has historically sought a buffer to protect itself from foreign
invaders. Stalin wanted territory from Turkey and Iran after World War
II because of those states' proximity to Georgia, Azerbaijan, and
Armenia. Neither he nor Mikhail Gorbachev would accept a unified Germany
given that country's role in invading Russia twice in the twentieth
century. (Gorbachev also supported Russian military intervention in
Georgia and Crimea.) After the Cold War, the United States ignored
Russia's historical insecurity about foreign encirclement by expanding
NATO. As Andrew and Mitrokhin note, this came at a time when Russia's
territory was the smallest it had been since the reign of Catherine the
Great.

Those in the U.S. foreign-policy establishment well-versed in Russian
history were able to foresee the consequences of American meddling in
the former Soviet space. Strobe Talbott, President William Jefferson
Clinton's point man for all things Russia, cautioned, "[An **expanded
NATO** that excludes Russia will not serve to contain Russia's
retrograde, expansionist impulses." Kennan argued that NATO expansion
**would "inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western tendencies** in Russian
opinion," retard the development of Russian democracy, bring about a
"new cold war," and "impel Russian foreign policy in directions
decidedly not to \[America's\] liking."]{.underline}

While both Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin opposed NATO expansion, U.S.
meddling in the near abroad also ensured that these men would not be the
type of leaders Washington would deal with in future negotiations with
Moscow. The USSR's dissolution brought about a decreased role for the
vanguard of that empire, those serving in the armed forces and
security/intelligence apparatus. After their aborted attempt to unseat
President Gorbachev in August 1991, the security class was relegated to
the wayside until American meddling in the former Soviet space gave them
an excuse to claw their way back to power, a point lost on most Western
observers.

In their other major KGB expose, The Sword and the Shield: Thye
Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB, Andrew and
Mitrokhin largely attribute the resurgence of the security class to one
man: Yevgeniy Primakov. A former KGB Arabist, Primakov headed Russia's
external intelligence agency, the SVR, until 1996 when he supplanted the
largely pro-Western Andrey Kozyrev as foreign minister. In his previous
capacity, Primakov wrote a report in 1993 attacking NATO expansion as a
threat to Russia and warned the United States the following year not to
impede Russia's efforts at political and economic reintegration with the
former Soviet republics.

Primakov left the SVR in the care of his deputy, Vyacheslav Trubnikov.
The agency authored reports for President Yel'tsin reflecting its own
view on world events and providing complementary policy options. As
foreign minister, Primakov no doubt encouraged Yel'tsin to adopt such
views. During Trubnikov's tenure, the SVR also extended olive branches
to regimes such as Saddam Husayn's Iraq and Slobodan Milosevic's
Yugoslavia because, according to Andrew and Mitrokhin, the agency did
not want "to be defeated by the West."

The East-West clash of civilizations view inherent in the security
services did not depart from the Kremlin after Primakov's ouster from
the Yel'tsin administration in 1999. (He had become prime minister at
that point.) Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, showed a
considerable willingness to partner with the West on issues such as
counterterrorism despite being a former KGB officer. It is unclear to
what extent Putin initially embraced the clash of civilizations view
held by many in the security class (commonly referred to as the siloviki
throughout his tenure), but any suspicions he had were certainly
warranted given the acceptance of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech
Republic into NATO and the Alliance's bombing of Yugoslavia, both of
which occurred the year before he was elected president.

Upon Putin's ascension to the presidency, the siloviki obtained key
positions in what Amy Knight, author of Orders to Kill: The Putin Regime
and Political Murder, calls Russia's "power ministries," the police and
security agencies. (Additionally, KGB veteran Igor Sechin, Putin's de
facto second in command, became head of the state-owned Rosneft oil
company.) Knight offers a profile of one of these men, Security Council
head and former KGB officer Nikolay Patrushev, writing that, like Putin,
he harbors "a deep distrust of the West, repeatedly accusing Western
governments of plans to undermine Russia's political stability."

[**American meddling is sure to only reinforce the worldview held**
**by** Patrushev, **Putin**, and the other siloviki, and the way that
information flows through Putin's administration can do nothing but fan
the flames of the new cold war]{.underline}. According to The New Tsar,
written by former New York Times correspondent Steven Lee Meyers,
Putin's office computer reportedly lacks an Internet connection, a
purposeful design so that he can solicit information from only his most
trusted advisers, many of whom are siloviki. Putin has even come to
favor certain security officials over others. According to Mark
Galeotti, he has politically isolated the SVR and military intelligence,
ensuring his primary flow of information comes from the Federal Security
Service (FSB), the agency he (and Patrushev) once headed and many of
whose members share the view that the West is trying to encircle and
bring down Russia.

[In short, provocative **American actions**---NATO expansion, support
for the so-called "color revolutions," regime change wars in the Middle
East---**have triggered** historical **Russian suspicions** of foreign
intervention and empowered a jingoistic security class that operates in
an information vacuum]{.underline}. Russo-American relations are at a
historic impasse as any further Western intervention in the former
Soviet space or efforts to punish Russia for its overseas meddling will
only affirm the view of the siloviki that there exists a Western plot to
keep Russia down (with much of the Russian public sharing this view).
They will respond by further severing ties with the West. The United
States must acknowledge the role that it has played in the Russian
security class's consolidation of power, and it should consider
decreasing its political-military presence in areas Russia traditionally
considers to be in its sphere of influence (this would include both the
former Soviet space and the Middle East). Doing so could weaken the
narrative that the siloviki rely on to stay in power and restore
Washington's relations with Moscow to a healthy state.

### AT allies -- Budapest Memo

4\) [Washington never guaranteed Ukraine's security]{.underline}.

Never mind whether it is in America's interest to go to war over
Ukraine, argue some Kiev advocates. [Washington committed itself to do
so two decades ago through the 1994 Budapest Memorandum]{.underline} on
Security Assurances after Ukraine relinquished the nuclear weapons left
by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The U.S. must "enforce" the
agreement --- presumably by nuclear war, if necessary. [In fact,
Washington joined Britain and Russia in making a series of commitments
regarding Ukraine. **But none of them involved going to
war**]{.underline}. [The three signatories lauded Ukraine for signing
the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and committed themselves to respect
Ukraine's sovereignty]{.underline} and borders; refrain from threatening
Ukraine with military force or economic coercion; go to the UN on Kiev's
behalf if the latter faced aggression "in which nuclear weapons are
used"; refrain from using nukes against non-nuclear states; and consult
"in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these
commitments." [In short, Washington offered Ukraine no meaningful
commitment to do anything practical to help Kiev in any circumstance. If
the Clinton administration had intended to defend Ukraine, the former
would have presented a treaty for Senate approval]{.underline} or forced
through Kiev's accession to NATO. [But Washington was no more ready to
go to war for Ukraine in 1994 than in 2014. Allied politicians offered
high-sounding rhetoric rather than practical commitments. The Ukrainian
government accepted what it could get, which was just a piece of
paper]{.underline}.

### AT allies -- Iran impact

#### They won't prolif\-\--NPT is in [their self-interest]{.underline}

Ezra **Friedman 18**, candidate for an MSc in International Relations at
the London School of Economics and Political Science, "[Will Iran go
nuclear over **reimposed sanctions**]{.underline}?", Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, Aug 7 2018,
https://thebulletin.org/2018/08/will-iran-go-nuclear-over-reimposed-sanctions/

Why **[it's not in Iran's interest to leave the NPT]{.underline}**.
[Iran has several options once it leaves the JCPOA]{.underline}. [Some
statements by Iranian leaders suggest that Iran will race to acquire a
nuclear device]{.underline}, ramping up its nuclear program so as to
achieve this goal as quickly as possible, either overtly or covertly.
[Iran's critics point to its past violations of the]{.underline} Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty ([NPT]{.underline}) in the early 2000s,
confirmed by an Israeli intelligence operation earlier this year. (Iran
has been a party to the treaty since 1970.) [**While frightening, this
scenario is unlikely**, because it would place Iran in the same category
as North Korea: a **pariah in the eyes of the international
community**]{.underline}. [On a strategic level, Tehran is **keenly
aware** of this possibility and wants to avoid it at all
costs]{.underline}. [Even if Iran would like to have a militarized
nuclear program, the cost would be **massive if not unbearable for the
regime.**]{.underline} Like North Korea, Iran is subject to many
different types of sanctions, but they are nowhere near as isolating as
those North Korea faces. [Iran is **more reliant on the world economy**
than North Korea is]{.underline}, [especially with regard to
petroleum-related exports, and **isolation on the scale that North Korea
faces would likely be a mortal wound for the regime.** Iran can wait a
while before acting decisively]{.underline}, as many of the current UN
Security Council sanctions will expire soon. [A violation of the NPT by
Iran would be a uniting factor for the American and European parties to
the Iran nuclear deal and would **force countries like Russia and China
to come down hard on Iran**. Withdrawing from the NPT and pursuing a
militarized nuclear program would also **expose Iran to a possible
military strike by the United States or Israel**]{.underline}. While
Trump seems reluctant to wield American military power, [Israel has a
strong record of being able and willing to strike]{.underline}. Israel
has been unafraid to attack Iranian targets in Syria when it feels
threatened on its border or in the transfer of advanced munitions from
Tehran to Hezbollah via Syria. [While Iran is a much larger and more
powerful country on paper, Israel has proved in recent battles with Iran
to be the **superior force**]{.underline}. [There is strong consensus in
Israel that a nuclear Iran would be an **existential
threat**]{.underline}, and Prime Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu has
considered striking Iran in the past.]{.underline} Rather than
withdrawing from the NPT, [it is more likely that Iran will return to
something akin to a pre-JCPOA scenario, with a nuclear program that is
enriching uranium to 20 percent or more without the full oversight of
the International Atomic Energy Agency]{.underline}---which will almost
certainly lose its current ability to access Iran's known non-military
nuclear sites upon Iran's exit from the JCPOA. [In this scenario, Iran
will have a short "breakout period"---the time needed to produce enough
weapons-grade uranium to build its first nuclear device---estimated at
five weeks to a **year**.]{.underline}

#### They don't want it

Raphael **Ahren 16**, diplomatic correspondent at The Times of Israel,
"Why Iran really, truly doesn't want the bomb... for now", The Times of
Israel, Feb 1 2016,
https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-iran-really-truly-doesnt-want-the-bomb-for-now-at-least/

Going nuclear is every country's dream. Atomic bombs not only bring much
prestige but also create deterrence and allow their owners to launch
offensives strikes that could annihilate any enemy. That's why a rogue
state like Iran would love nothing more than to get its hands on them.
Or at least that's what conventional wisdom, and many Israeli officials,
would have you believe. "Even after the signing of the nuclear
agreement, Iran has not relinquished its aspiration to obtain nuclear
weapons," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated earlier this month.
But François [Heisbourg, a renowned French expert on nuclear deterrence
and proliferation, argues that Tehran is currently not keen on crossing
the nuclear threshold, and will likely not even seek to do so **even
after the nuclear agreement expires in 15 years**]{.underline}. Rather,
he explained, [the regime suffices]{.underline} (and will probably
suffice) [with what he calls "recessed deterrence."]{.underline} [In
addition to avoiding the various headaches that come with operating a
military nuclear program, most notably international sanctions, staying
clear of the club of nuclear powers gives Iran **greater flexibility to
wage conventional warfare**]{.underline}, Heisbourg argues. "The
Iranians have made their point," said Heisbourg, who chairs the UK-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Geneva Centre for
Security Policy. "[They have shown that under certain circumstances they
could become a nuclear power.]{.underline} **[That has value in
itself]{.underline}**. [It provides a form of deterrence, which is,
'Don't fuck with me. I am not a nuclear power but I could become one
tomorrow, so behave]{.underline}.' For the time being, **[this is more
than enough for the Iranians."]{.underline}** After all, [the
international community is aware that, under the parameters of the
nuclear deal, **Tehran remains between six to 18 months away from
breakout capability**]{.underline}. [That means that the regime could,
at a moment of its choosing, cancel the agreement, resume its military
nuclear program and produce a bomb in **less than two
years**]{.underline}. (Many experts put the current breakout time at
about 12 months.) ['Nuclear weapons give you deterrence, but they also
tie your hands. This is the beauty of Iran's current situation. If they
do something very rash, they're not provoking a global crisis; they're
provoking a regional crisis']{.underline} According to the terms of
so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Tehran was not forced to
entirely dismantle its military nuclear program but had to give up
essential parts of it. For as long as Iran adheres to the deal, it is
thus not a nuclear power. That means that when the regime wants to act
forcefully --- in Syria or Iraq, against the Saudi embassy in Tehran, or
against its Sunni rivals in the Persian Gulf --- it is not provoking a
nuclear crisis, Heisbourg said. "[Insofar as it is not provoking a
nuclear crisis, it is not provoking a world crisis --- and that gives
you **much more freedom of maneuver than when you are a nuclear
power**]{.underline}," Heisbourg told The Times of Israel at the
sidelines of the Institute for National Security Studies' annual
conference last week in Tel Aviv. Conflicts involving nuclear powers
always bear the risk of nuclear war, which makes them a global concern.
But as long as the [Iranians]{.underline} do not have that status, their
[aggression in the region is less worrisome to the rest of the
world]{.underline}, said Heisbourg, who in the 1980s served as the
French defense minister's international security adviser.

### AT battlefield victory -- not deployed

\*\*\*I think this could potentially contradict the escalation spiral
argument, and definitely the BHD arg

#### Javelins won't even be deployed, but still signal US support for Ukraine

**Gressel 18** -- senior policy fellow with the Wider Europe Programme
at the European Council on Foreign Relations\' Berlin office (Gustav,
"Lethal weapon: Has Trump mis-stepped on Ukraine?," *ECFR*,
<https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_lethal_weapon_has_trump_mis_stepped_on_ukraine)//BB>

So overall the [Trump]{.underline} administration's decision to sell
ATGW to Ukraine, even belatedly, makes sense. But the choice of weapon
matters too -- and here the administration [may have made a
mistake]{.underline}. The Javelin belongs to the latest generation of
ATGW that the US and many NATO members rely on to defend themselves
against possible Russian action. If a Javelin were to fall into Russian
hands -- either on the battlefield or through espionage -- this would
compromise US security. Moreover, [Ukraine's security
service,]{.underline} which is also responsible for military security,
has been involved in too many incidents of abuse of power against
anti-corruption agents, journalists, reformers, and opposition party
members to be trusted. The service [is unreformed and it is still
vulnerable to corruption and compromise]{.underline}. So for now [the
missiles are **stored at American training facilities** in western
Ukraine]{.underline}. [Ukrainian forces are receiving training on them,
but it is **not yet clear whether they will actually be able to deploy
them** to the warzone in eastern Ukraine]{.underline}.

The West -- both the Americans and the Europeans -- could have achieved
a more effective outcome had they delivered used ATGW of an older
generation, like the TOW, HOT, Bill 1, Milan, or Dragon, and had they
done so at an earlier stage. Such missiles would deter Russia's proxy
forces, but the West would allow Ukraine to use them in combat -- even
if the Russians captured the equipment, the harm would be minimal.
Indeed, in the Syrian civil war the CIA funnelled TOW ATGW via Saudi
Arabia to several rebel forces, which used them on Russian tanks and
helicopters. Equally, the West could have persuaded Ukraine into a
comprehensive security sector reform to improve the reliability of its
agencies -- particularly the SBU -- and reward such reform with access
to modern defence equipment -- including the Javelin. Instead the
inward-looking "strategic debate" on "lethal aid" ran along lines scored
inside the Washington and Brussels beltways rather than seeking to
address the military reality in Ukraine.

Still, [on the level of political symbolism and signalling, the decision
still matters.]{.underline} Petro [Poroshenko can claim to have won
American support in a matter of crucial importance]{.underline}.
Likewise, Donald [Trump can claim that he has become "hard on Russia
like no one before]{.underline}", while in substance not crossing too
many of the Kremlin's red lines. [But for the soldiers in the Donbas
trenches, the shelling and fighting will continue on the same patterns.
The supply of Javelins changes the overall balance **little** but
**increases the risk** for Ukraine and the US.]{.underline} As such, the
decision to send lethal aid has, literally, delivered first-class
equipment to a country which cannot use it, leaving the ATGW to gather
dusk locked away, far from the front. Whether it will ever make it to
the front, given the risks, remains to be seen.

#### The Javelin won't be deployed to the front-lines

**Grove 18** (Thomas and Julian Barnes, "U.S., Ukraine Try to Ensure
Weapons Don't Fall to Enemy," *Wall Street Journal*,
<https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ukraine-try-to-ensure-weapons-dont-fall-to-enemy-1515067601)//BB>

[U.S. plans to arm Ukraine]{.underline} infuriated Russia and aggravated
deteriorating relations, but a bigger worry is the weapons falling into
enemy hands---as has happened before. Washington last month decided to
send lethal aid to Ukraine to prevent aggression by pro-Russia
separatists. The move is meant to keep the simmering conflict from
flaring into a hot war by improving government forces' ability to defend
against possible rebel offensives. But the policy [is fraught with
potential national-security pitfalls, particularly the risk of the
weapons ending up on the other side]{.underline}. U.S. officials say
they have carefully considered the dangers, taking particular
precautions with [Javelin anti-tank missiles]{.underline} the Trump
administration is sending. Those weapons [have been designated for units
far back from the eastern Ukraine frontline to ensure that Ukraine
doesn't use them for an offensive push and they aren't lost to the enemy
if the fighting shifts]{.underline}. [They will be stored at training
centers]{.underline}. [American soldiers]{.underline}, who are now at a
base in far western Ukraine but could move to bases in more central
parts of the country, [will regularly check and count them while
training units.]{.underline} "[There is a \[training\] package that goes
along with the weapons]{.underline} that gives people on our side a lot
of reassurance that we will be able to keep tabs on them," said a senior
U.S. official. [It's not a theoretical problem. After the U.S. delivered
short-range radar systems to Ukraine in 2014, at least one was deployed
to the frontline]{.underline} near the eastern city of Debaltseve to
detect the site from which rebels were launching artillery attacks.
[Separatist forces overwhelmed the government troops]{.underline}, who
fled and left parts of the radar behind. Pro[-Kremlin media triumphantly
published pictures of the components in their boxes]{.underline}. "It
was interesting to get a look at the American technology," said Anton
Lavrov, an independent Russian military analyst, referring to the
published photos. A Ukraine military spokesman said it intentionally
destroyed parts of the radar system before the withdrawal and
immediately informed the U.S. An official close to the Russian defense
ministry said the capture was less a military-technology gold mine than
a psychological victory and chance for nose-thumbing at U.S. policy.
[The problem hasn't been limited to Ukraine. The U.S. provided
aid]{.underline}, including training and equipment, [to
Georgia]{.underline} during its 2008 conflict with Russia-backed
separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, [and American-issued
equipment was captured]{.underline} on Georgian bases. The Russian
official said that on a trip to Armenia, he met special forces with U.S.
gear, including boots, field jackets and knives, which he said he
identified from the brands and make. He said they told him they bought
it at an informal street market in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. A
Pentagon spokesman noted that Ukraine and Georgia are required to adopt
the same security measures as the U.S. and said it "conducts meticulous
evaluations of physical security preparations and capabilities."
Conflict Armament Research, a group that documents sources of weapons in
conflict zones, last month released a report saying the U.S. provided
Syrian rebels with arms contributed by North Atlantic Treaty
Organization allies, much of it Eastern European surplus, that then made
its way into the hands of Islamic State. Responding to the report, the
Pentagon said it was monitoring alleged misuses and would curtail
support for rebels if the weapons were lost. Perhaps most notoriously,
the CIA in the 1990s had to buy back Stinger missiles it provided in the
1980s to Afghan Mujahideen fighting the Soviet army, which it has never
publicly acknowledged. U.S. officials feared the shoulder-launched
missiles could be targeted against commercial jetliners or be used by
Taliban forces. Today, arming rebel groups in Syria or Afghanistan is
far different from providing arms to the Ukrainian government, the
senior U.S. official said. "Basically things work in Ukraine," the
official said. "It is a totally different thing than an ongoing civil
war." [Keeping Javelins from the frontline also means **they will not
have a direct impact on the battlefield**]{.underline}. U.S. and Ukraine
officials say the importance of the weapons is not to push back
separatist troops but to strengthen the diplomatic push to settle the
conflict.

### AT battlefield victory -- indigenous weapons

#### Ukraine's indigenous defense industry solves

**Schinault 19** (Ryan, "Attrition: Rebuilding the Ukrainian Military,"
*The Strategy Page*,
<https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htatrit/20190218.aspx)//BB>

[Because o]{.underline}f this [mobilization Ukraine was able to
concentrate a large enough force of infantry, armor and support units in
the Donbas to fight the Russian backed rebels]{.underline}. Because so
few Donbas residents were pro-Russian the Donbas rebel defenders were
increasingly Russian soldiers pretending to be Ukrainian Donbas rebels.
[Russian advances in Donbas came to a standstill by the end of
2014]{.underline}. The Russian backed force only occupied about half the
territory of Donbas and a ceasefire signed in 2015 has kept the front
line largely static since then. The Russians keep violating the
ceasefire, probing Ukrainian forces seeking a weakness. That has not
worked because [enough Ukrainians volunteered to join the army or
militia units and received enough new equipment from a **rapidly
mobilized Ukrainian defense industry** to contain the Russian backed
efforts to advance]{.underline}. The war has revealed the state of
disarray Ukrainian Armed Forces had fallen into since they became
independent of Russia in 1991. In early 2016 Ukrainian forces proved to
be both untrained and underequipped to confront the Russian created
United Armed Forces of Novorossiya in Donbas. That was only the first of
many disappointments the Russians encountered in Donbas. Prior to the
fall of the Soviet Union and as part of the Soviet Army, Ukraine's
'portion' of the Soviet military, which became independent Ukraine's
Army, was one of the largest and most advanced militaries in the world.
While Ukraine reduced the personnel in their post-Soviet military and
they held onto all that Soviet era weaponry they inherited and that
stuff became a key factor in stopping the Russians. Since 2014, sporadic
fighting has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced 2 million more
from an area sliced through by a 500-kilometer long \"line of contact\".
As Russian military supplies continue to enter Ukraine, it becomes
harder by the day for Russia to deny that it is providing arms to the
rebels. Russian support to the rebels has doubled since the 2015
ceasefire. Russian support for the separatists includes artillery,
surveillance UAVs, and armored vehicles that would otherwise be nearly
impossible for the rebels to obtain. [Ukraine took advantage of the fact
the because of all those Cold War era arms factories and weapons
stockpiles they inherited they had, by 2012 become the fourth largest
arms exporter in the world]{.underline}. Most of these weapons were Cold
War surplus although Ukraine had developed the ability to upgrade and
refurbish these 1980s era armored, artillery and other designs.
Neighboring Poland had become a manufacturer of more modern weapons and
took the side of Ukraine against their mutual enemy. Poland quickly
became one of the largest weapon suppliers to Ukraine. This was also
because most Western countries refused to supply Ukraine with weapons
because of the fear it would escalate the war, perhaps even beyond
Ukraine. [In an effort to sustain operations against rebel Donbas rebels
Ukraine was forced to quickly undergo rearmament using existing weapons
production capabilities in Ukraine and coordinating repairs and
refurbishment of existing equipment]{.underline}. Ukraine did receive
help from East European nations that had joined NATO since 1991 and
still operated some Russian equipment from the Cold War era. Despite the
European Union and United States vigorous rhetoric, they have been
supporting Ukraine mostly diplomatically and economically, but their
help in modernizing the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been token gestures.
[Most of the work has been done by the Ukrainians
themselves]{.underline} with some help from East European neighbors.
Ukraine focused on the refurbishment of the most modern existing
equipment. The Ukrainian Army was already using 250 T-64BM "Bulat" tanks
and 350 T-64BV tanks. Ukraine also has 1,000 T-64B tanks in storage. The
T-64BM and T-64BV are upgrades of some of the -64Bs placed in storage
after 1991. Ukraine had been upgrading 12 to 14 vehicles to the "Bulat"
standard each year since 2007. This cost about \$600,000 per vehicle.
Ukraine was also building the T-84 Oplot-M tank and currently has 16 in
service and plans to acquire 160 more. The cost per unit is \$3,700,000
but represented a huge achievement for the Ukrainian arms industry as
these are very effective tanks that are equipped with state of the art
tech. Ukraine had so many Cold War era Russian tanks in storage that it
could rely on these for a steady supply of replacement parts or
components for refurbishing the 167 T-80 UD and 1,032 T-72 M1 tanks.
Most of these tanks are still in storage. The vast majority of Ukraine's
T-80 and T-72 battle tanks were manufactured in Russia and therefore
parts are not available. Initial battles in Donbas led to heavy losses
of the existing the T-64BV, so Ukraine began converting T-64B tanks to
the T-64BM variant. Ukraine also began manufacturing key T-72 components
and restoring the surplus (and in storage) T-72s to operational status.
Ukraine noted that it could do an even better job of these T-72 refurbs
and upgrades when they could depend on using components from Western
firms. But those sources have been blocked since 2014. [Ukraine
continues upgrading its military with locally made
equipment]{.underline}. This was not just to deal with the de facto loss
of half the territory in Donbas but to prepare for future Russian
aggression and to increase Ukrainian exports of "combat proven" weapons.
Israel, for example, has purchased Ukrainian EW (Electronic Warfare)
equipment capable of detecting the presence and location of Russian air
defense systems over a large area. No one else was producing anything
like this and Israel needed it to deal with the Iranian and Russian
threat in Syria. China is also an export customer as are a number of
other nations in Africa and Asia. There is also help coming from outside
Ukraine with a growing number of countries are considering selling, or
donating, weapons to Ukraine. There are still a lot of older weapon
systems and military equipment that has been retired but still usable
and easily shipped to Ukraine. Meanwhile, [Donbas remains a stalemate
and a buffer zone between Ukraine and Russia, which may be what Russia
wanted in the first place]{.underline}. There are other problems created
by this state of war with Russia. NATO rules forbid a nation with such
an existing territorial dispute from joining NATO. This is seen as a
benefit by Russia, which does not want Ukraine to join NATO. Another
former part of the Soviet Union, Georgia in the Caucasus, got caught in
the same trap in 2008 when Russia backed rebels in South Ossetia and
Abkhazia. Since 2015, and in response to the continued Russian attacks,
Poland and Western countries have slowly relented on their refusal to
provide military assistance. Russia is seen as a persistent and growing
threat to all of East Europe and the West. Poland is now selling weapons
to Ukraine on commercial terms. While Poland is willing to sell weapons
and equipment to Ukraine, it is not ready to provide credit. Ukraine has
suffered financial troubles for years even before the 2014 revolution,
and the current military conflict has only made the economic problems
worse. Poland was one of the first Western nations to provide
"defensive" equipment. In mid-2014, Ukraine bought 6,000 Polish Wz.2005
helmets and 2,000 KWM-2 bulletproof vests for its army reserve forces.
In part because this gear was for the "National Guard" which in
peacetime is controlled by the Ministry of the Interior and not the
Defense Ministry. Russia did not make an issue of this because it was
for paramilitary troops who were also fighting in Donbas. The 2014
shipment cost Ukraine \$5.75 million dollars. The vests and helmets were
equal to the stuff most NATO nations, including the U.S., are using. In
addition to the arms sales from Poland, **[Ukraine is advancing
significantly in the maintenance and development of Ukraine's arms
industry]{.underline}**, [which keeps the money in Ukraine]{.underline}.
Also, Ukraine continues to refurbish and sell surplus equipment and
spare parts for equipment that Ukraine is already using. Examples
include decommissioned tanks, helicopters, and both transport and combat
aircraft. Ukraine will need some of this equipment to monitor and guard
key locations in Ukraine such as Mariupol and Odessa as well as the
eastern border to Donbas. Once the lines on the map of Ukraine are
redrawn, [the time will come for the military of Ukraine to return to
its Cold War posture of preparing for possible defensive action against
an invasion]{.underline}. The only difference is this time; the threat
is from the east and not the west.

### AT battlefield victory -- no interoperability

#### Arms sales don't work \-\-- [logistical and compatibility]{.underline} problems

**Ashford 15** -- PhD @ UVA (Emma, "Don't Raise the Stakes in Ukraine,"
https://www.cato.org/blog/dont-raise-stakes-ukraine)

Unfortunately, [arming Ukraine will cause more problems than it
solves]{.underline}. Certainly, such a move would be a propaganda coup
for Russia, which has already been using state media to perpetuate the
idea that NATO is involved in the crisis. Russian media is extremely
good at blurring key facts to make a coherent, anti-Western narrative,
even if the narrative itself is fundamentally false. It won't matter
than the weapons are 'defensive' in nature; the Russian media can spin
this to bolster their arguments that Ukraine's government is
illegitimate and that the conflict is being driven by NATO. It could
even increase popular support for the war among the Russian population.
Arming Ukraine will also shift U.S. policy further away from that of
European allies. Although the report's authors note that many European
states could also be encouraged to provide weapons, several key states
have already weighed in against such a move. Just yesterday, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters: "Germany will not support
Ukraine with weapons... I am convinced that this conflict cannot be
solved militarily." Differentiating the U.S. response from that of
European leaders will only provide more ammunition for Russian
dissension, further minimizing the likelihood of a diplomatic
settlement. **[Logistical problems abound]{.underline}**.
[**Compatibility** may be a major problem given Ukraine's primarily
Soviet and post-Soviet armaments.]{.underline} Timing is another
concern: although the report suggests that the U.S. could use current
stocks of weapons, it may be logistically impossible to get large
quantities of arms to Ukraine, or complete any necessary training, in
time for the likely spring offensive by pro-Russian rebels. [Even if
these problems were overcome, the assumption that weapons will help
Ukrainian forces is itself problematic. The Ukrainian army is poorly
trained, and would likely require expert support and
training]{.underline} from U.S. personnel. [The integration of volunteer
units into fighting forces is patchy, and corruption remains a problem.
Even with U.S. weapons, there is effectively **no prospect** of a
Ukrainian military triumph]{.underline}.

### AT negotiations

#### Negotiations fail -- diplomacy can't work while future arms are on the table

**Ellison 18** -- MA candidate @ UNC-Chapel Hill, contributor @ The
Foreign Analyst, intern @ NATO Allied Command Transformation (Davis,
"Alternatives, not Arms, are Needed for Ukraine. [By selling weapons to
Ukraine, the United States is risking increased conflict while ignoring
diplomatic alternatives]{.underline}.," The Foreign Analyst,
<http://theforeignanalyst.com/alternatives-not-arms-are-needed-for-ukraine/)//BB>

[Support for arming Ukraine with lethal weaponry]{.underline} has come
from American national security experts on both sides of the political
spectrum. Unfortunately, their confidence in this strategy [is based on
a misread of both the situation in Ukraine and of the strategic
realities of US-Russian relations. The time has come for a new
diplomatic settlement.]{.underline} In December of last year, the US
administration approved [the sale of lethal arms to
Ukraine]{.underline}. This [could lead to a serious escalation of
violence]{.underline}, particularly as both the Ukrainian military and
the eastern oblast rebels continue to violate the terms of the Minsk II
ceasefire signed in 2015[. Within a "new cold war" era between Russia
and the West, we tend to forget that the Ukraine conflict is rather a
civil war involving external intervention, than a proxy war between
great powers]{.underline}. This decision is clearly based on [a flawed
concept of "escalate to de-escalate]{.underline}" that likely originated
in a Defense Department increasingly spearheading US foreign policy.
Such a theoretical basis for policy [is weak]{.underline} at best,
especially as [it ignores the fundamental facts of the
conflict]{.underline}. [It underestimates the involvement of the
separatists themselves in the conflict, conflating the war into a full
scale territorial clash between Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}. While
Russia's direct involvement is undeniable, [the conflict has hardly
escalated to general war]{.underline}. Who then, is the United States
planning to fight against? A separatist movement with a dearth of
grassroots support in their own territory? As Robert Work stated in a
2015 Congressional testimony: "[escalation is escalation" and sending
arms would thus necessitate an escalatory response]{.underline}.
Alternative [diplomatic solutions have been lacking]{.underline} as the
debate over a Ukrainian solution has raged. [Previous experiences in
conflict resolution have been largely ignored by analysts, with US
policy therefore following a zero-sum path that is]{.underline} slowly
[eroding possibilities for a negotiated settlement]{.underline}. There
are two historical examples that can inform policymakers to prudently
approach Ukraine without resorting to arms shipments: Cyprus and Bosnia.
Incentivizing Moscow to attack or escalate [Increased arms sales will
likely cause a greater incentive for both side to violate the Minsk II
agreement and rather pursue an escalatory course that will only deepen
the conflict, further entrench the adversaries and increase
casualties]{.underline}. [There is no reason to believe such a move
would provide a deterrent]{.underline} either, [with the military
reality on the ground belying any attempt to persuade
otherwise]{.underline}. A combination between Russian military
prevalence and the complicated nature of US policy in the former Soviet
Union has led to a climate where actions are limited. This offer of arms
is particularly dangerous due to NATO's 2008 pledge to eventually
consider a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine. By extending this offer a
decade ago, without any security guarantees, NATO left Ukraine
vulnerable to Russia giving Moscow an incentive to prevent this future
membership. Offering weapons while also continuing to deny any form of
security guarantee is only inviting more danger by increasing the
likeliness of a Russian military intervention. Additionally, the
often-cited 1994 Budapest Memorandum between Ukraine, Russia, the US,
and the UK (also Belarus and Kazakhstan) does not obligate the United
States to militarily defend Ukraine against a conventional threat
without UN Security Council authorization. While acting without UNSC
authorization is certainly possible, it would be diplomatically
dangerous. [Moscow has to respond to these promised weapons sales, and
its options place both Ukraine and the West in an untenable
position]{.underline}. First, [it could push for the separatist eastern
regions to become unified with Russia itself, leading to yet another
forceful border change in violation of all international legal
norms]{.underline}. Second, [Russia could shut off Ukraine's
power]{.underline} once again, while also blocking the importation of
energy by force. [Another option would be to increase provocations
against eastern NATO members, namely the Baltic states,
through]{.underline} actions other than armed conflict such as
[cyberattacks and kidnappings]{.underline}. These are only a few out of
host options Moscow is likely to consider, with other more pernicious
options being also possible. Daniel DePetris of Reuters has noted that
"[there's no reason to think Putin would respond less violently now if
Washington sent defense shipments to Ukraine]{.underline}," in reference
to a Russian armored offensive against Debaltseve in late 2014. As noted
by several authors, including Rajan Menon and Fiona Hill, Russia holds
"escalation dominance" in the region, though it has never been fully
explained nor has its strategic implications been clarified. First and
foremost, escalation dominance means that in almost any conceivable
conventional conflict in Eastern Ukraine, Russia will be victorious.
Ukraine sits in between both the Western and Southern Military
districts, with the entirety of the Russian command-and-control and
logistics network within short distances. Furthermore, Russian troops
have also begun building permanent bases along the border with Ukraine,
including highly mobile and combat experienced units that can quickly
bring reinforcement. Simply put, [there is no amount of weapons
importation by Ukraine that can offset Russian conventional superiority
in the near- to medium-term]{.underline}. Equally important to the
military dynamic, Russian dominance in the region forces any Western
diplomats to negotiate from a position of weakness, an uncomfortable
position for the United States. [The primary consequence here is that
the United States is hardly in a position to dictate any terms on a
settlement, and will require Moscow and Western allies' cooperation in
order to reach any meaningful progress]{.underline}. Sanctions can
certainly be seen as a useful coercive measure, but due to rises in
commodity prices, the Russian economy has seen a moderate improvement
recently despite its isolation. Therefore, **[a solution will have to be
found that makes concessions to Moscow]{.underline}**. The simple
logistical and military dominance that the Russian military holds in the
region makes [any pressure extremely unlikely to work]{.underline}. [By
providing weapons to Ukraine, the United States is]{.underline}
effectively [giving up on a negotiated settlement to the
conflict]{.underline}. [While the Minsk II agreement has been repeatedly
violated, this is no solid reasoning for its abandonment. By abandoning
the agreement and giving preference to]{.underline} a settlement via
[arms]{.underline}, [the United States is only further
internationalizing a civil war and ignoring the root
causes]{.underline}. Importantly, the civil war in Ukraine is between
irredentist Russian speakers in the eastern oblasts of Donetsk and
Luhansk and the central government, originating in differing views on
regional autonomy. The Russian government militarized these tensions
using the momentum of the Crimea annexation to turn a constitutional
dispute into an armed conflict. Diplomatic alternatives [Previous
conflicts in Europe that have included an ethnic dimension as well as
external influence should be used as a guide for policy options in
Ukraine]{.underline}. The first example is that of Cyprus, which bears
in some way a striking resemblance to the overall Ukrainian situation.
The island is divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, with only
Turkey recognizing the northern half of the island as an independent
territory. Spurred by ethnic conflict on the island, the ultimate
solution was found with the deployment of a United Nations Peacekeeping
Force, largely made up of troops from neutral states. The island has
remained divided since 1974, though the conflict has largely been
dormant since then. What is significant is that all states have been
able to continue fairly normalized relations with the Republic of Cyprus
(the southern, Greek speaking section of Cyprus) despite the ongoing
dispute, granting the country European Union membership in 2004. The
lesson to be taken from Cyprus is that a peacekeeping settlement, even
without a full resolution to the underlying territorial dispute, can be
effective. [Since fall 2017, calls for such a peacekeeping force in
Eastern Ukraine have been growing, with fairly widespread support,
including from Moscow]{.underline}. [To discard this avenue in favor of
arms support would be a mistake]{.underline}. As noted above, [even if
the two policies were taken at the same time, such arms supply to
Ukraine would only weaken any peacekeeping force while also failing to
strengthen the position of the US as a negotiator]{.underline}.
Importantly, the deployment of peacekeepers would have to involve
concessions made to Moscow, through the lifting of sanctions and/or the
de facto acceptance of the breakaway regions' autonomy. A second model
for a longer-term diplomatic approach is a federalization policy that
bears a resemblance to the Republika Srpska within Bosnia. The
federalization of Ukraine has been suggested by Russia for some time,
and it is perhaps time to consider the option seriously. Limited
devolution would address the desires of the separatists themselves while
meeting Russian requests. Such devolution could come with safeguards,
such as disarmament within both Donetsk and Luhansk, with Russia
providing security guarantees to both regions. In Bosnia, it has allowed
ethnic grievances between groups in Bosnia to be handled in a largely
non-violent fashion. The establishment of the Republika Srpska was a
hard pill for Western states to swallow, however it became necessary for
the higher goal of reaching a peaceful settlement. [A key lesson for the
United States in Bosnia was that the prevention of further bloodshed was
more important than the preservation of Yugoslavian
sovereignty]{.underline}. [Were the US]{.underline} and its allies [to
take this lesson to heart and eschew a hard line on Ukrainian
sovereignty with the goal of ending the conflict, it could begin a slow
path towards improving Western relations with Russia]{.underline}.
Finally, any solution will require neutrality for Ukraine. This would
mean removing the offer of NATO membership to Ukraine (which arguably
placed Ukraine in Moscow's crosshairs in the first place), and
maintaining an economic balance between the European Union and Moscow,
while also pushing against formal EU membership. This option has been
suggested by Michael O'Hanlon in his new book Beyond NATO, that argues
in favor of such proposal for currently unaligned states between Europe
and Russia. Removing the NATO offer would be immensely beneficial
towards building better future relations with Moscow and ending the
Ukrainian conflict. The current predicament the West finds itself in can
almost be considered comeuppance for the misguided NATO offer without
any security guarantee. Certainly, these solutions would not be
preferential for Western policymakers, but that is the nature of
compromise. They would effectively reverse decades of US and NATO
defense and diplomatic policy. However, current and recent policies have
hardly been adequate. There is no possibility of a diplomatic solution
that accords full territorial return of Crimea to Ukraine, nor can there
be any peacekeeping force dominated primarily by NATO. A further
drawback would be the abandonment of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum,
though the treaty itself was without the teeth for its own enforcement.
Any settlement regarding peacekeepers and/or devolution would provide
the opportunity to install stronger safeguards for all parties. [The
current US policy of arms **supplying rules out any**]{.underline}
possibilities of [**constructive diplomatic efforts** to resolve the
security situation in Ukraine]{.underline}. Both options (along with
O'Hanlon's suggestions of permanent Ukrainian neutrality), do not fully
preclude the establishment of harsher measures should Russia continue to
make aggressive moves despite these agreements. Harsher economic
sanctions against the Kremlin's inner circle or even extension of a NATO
security guarantee despite an ongoing territorial dispute should be kept
on the table in case Moscow decides to further endanger Ukraine.
However, it is critical that policy be shaped by the realities of the
situation in Ukraine, rather than preferred outcomes. Diplomacy should
be pursued first, using past instances of conflict resolution as a
model.

#### Peace negotiations fail -- empirics prove

**Inozemtsev 18** -- is director of the Centre for Post-Industrial
Studies in Moscow. (Vladislav, "[There\'ll be no end to the war between
Russia and Ukraine while it suits political elites on both sides to keep
fighting]{.underline}" Independent. August 29, 2018.

Ever since fighting began in 2014 -- and especially since the
involvement of Russian soldiers became more obvious in August of that
year -- [most politicians and commentators in the west have approached
the dispute in a simplistic way, convinced]{.underline} that the
conflict harms both of the nations involved, and [that it should
therefore be in the interests of both sides for the fighting to be
brought to an end]{.underline}. Western scholars have depicted it as a
unique lose-lose ga­me, where no one will or can win (see, for instance,
Samuel Charup and Timothy Colton's book Everyone Loses: The Ukraine
Crisis and the Ruinous Contest for Post-Soviet Eurasia). Most have
assumed or hoped that the elites in both countries will eventually
realise this fact. But [both **politicians** and commentators **have
based their conclusions on a set of erroneous
assumptions.**]{.underline} In the early 2000s World Bank analysts
coined the term "state capture", which they applied to the most backward
states of post-Soviet central Asia. They argued that in many cases
either small groups of businessmen or several "oligarchs" had "shaped
the rules of the game to their advantage through illicit,
non-transparent pro­vision of private gains to public officials",
including by engineering changes to electoral systems and by recourse to
sometimes dubious court decisions. In such circumstances, a state became
an instrument which, having been captured by, acts on behalf of, the
oligarchs, who corrupt the country's political leaders. I tend to agree
with this definition, but I think one should also go further. While
notions of state capture can certainly be seen in Russia and Ukraine in
the 1990s, since that time a lot has changed. No longer can it
reasonably be concluded that there are oligarchs who are directing
either of these countries. Rather, many of the top politicians
themselves became the richest people in Russia and Ukraine, and some of
them seem to act almost exclusively for their own personal benefit. As
such, these neighbouring states -- both powerful and resource rich in
their distinct ways -- have been captured not by apolitical oligarchs
but increasingly by the political insiders, the bureaucrats and
apparatchiks. This dramatically changes their very nature. In Russia
these days, [laws are frequently introduced or modified to fit the
interests of a small group of influential people.]{.underline} Putin
warns of 'consequences' if Nato develops closer ties with Georgia and
Ukraine One example is the draft legislation known widely as the
"Rotenberg Law", by which the state would compensate citizens who fell
foul of "unjust decisions" by foreign courts. Which appeared mainly
designed to help Arkady Rotenberg, a former judo partner of Putin, whose
valuable property had been confiscated by the Italian government because
of sanctions linked to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In the event, the
legislation was not passed, but it is an interesting case study
nonetheless. Meanwhile, bureaucrats have regularly struck deals with
companies owned by their relatives, content in the knowledge that this
doesn't contradict the existing statute book. By some estimates,
proceeds from corruption accounted for \$200bn (£155bn) in 2012, which
was worth 8 per cent of Russia's GDP; President Medvedev said in 2011
that a trillion roubles, or around 9 per cent of the federal budget, had
been "misused" annually. It is easy to understand how huge the desire
for perpetuating such a regime should be among those who benefit from it
most. Putin warns over Ukraine, US tariffs and prospect of third world
war In Ukraine, the same kind of regime was consolidated later, but by
2010 the process was largely complete. President Yanukovych, a close
friend of the Kremlin, managed the country more or less as a personal
business, ensuring that money from every region and from every industry
ended up in his pockets and in those of his closest allies. Under
Yanukovych, Ukraine indeed raced ahead of Russia in one sense, with the
proceeds of corruption reaching 14 per cent of its GDP (as demonstrated
by Laurence Cockcroft in his Global Corruption. Money, Power, and Ethics
in the Modern World). Even after the so-called Revolution of Dignity,
which brought down Yanukovych's government, some things soon returned to
"normal". Some of the reformists who promised to bring change were lost
from the government, while the long talked about International
Anti-Corruption Court still hasn't been established even though both the
US and European leaders press hard. Some have argued that the failure to
get the court up and running reflects the reluctance of powerful people
within Ukraine to become accountable, even if it means Ukraine losing
access to international finance. Even though recent moves suggest the
court may yet become reality, few would be surprised by further delays.
And so we come to the major point: that the war in eastern Ukraine,
which harms two huge countries and which devastates the interests of
ordinary people caught up in the conflict, looks absolutely rational for
the political elites on both sides. The Kremlin uses the confrontation
to galvanise the subject it governs, provoking citizens to flock around
the president simply because no one changes their great leader at a time
of war. The conflict with Ukraine also creates a broader clash with the
west, furthering this agenda. Trump's silence on the Russia sanctions
shows he is scared of Putin In Kiev, militaristic rhetoric is used by
some to argue that economic reforms and the fight against corruption
should not take top priority until the nation's very existence is no
longer at risk. These states then, completely privatised by enormously
powerful politicians, do not behave with the logic of established,
uncorrupted democracies. For both Russia and Ukraine, the war in the
Donbass appears to be the most natural means not only to perpetuate the
rule of wealthy, strongman leaders but also to create dozens of new
means of enriching political plutocrats and associated hangers-on. War,
after all, is an expensive business. It is, on the face of it, a good
instinct for the world's most developed nations to seek to help
countries that are ailing, whatever the precise nature of their
hardships. However, when it comes to Ukraine -- and in theory at least
to Russia -- western leaders really should first determine whether state
power is being held in trust by true and genuine representatives of the
people; or whether, in fact, power has been captured by others for their
own gain. This is important not only because giving aid to countries
where corruption is rife ends up benefiting only the corrupt. It is
important too because, in cases where state power and wealth has been
"captured", it is impossible to expect political elites to act in ways
that would be considered rational elsewhere -- for instance in taking
courses of action which might enable society to progress towards true
democracy. That can be true even if a few individuals in dominant
positions are "clean": where bad apples predominate, rot is inevitable.
In 2015, the famous Minsk agreements -- brokered by France and Germany
-- led to a ceasefire that has been frequently ignored. [Even now the
conflict between Ukrainian and Russian-backed forces simmers on, with
seemingly **little appetite to move the peace process
forward**]{.underline}. Yet I would argue that those agreements were
fundamentally flawed in any case -- struck, as they were, in an attempt
to pacify two states which are in search of benefits not for their
people, but primarily for their ruling classes. The captured states of
the 21st century are not only economically ineffective -- they are run
by people who believe wars are acceptable and beneficial. Indeed, for
elites, they are win-win games; and will continue to be so even while
decent western policymakers spend month after month, year after year,
looking for ways to promote peace.

#### Conditions fail -- arms sales wreck diplomatic processes 

**DePetris 17** -- a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington
thinktank. (Daniel, "Russia Will Retaliate After U.S. Supplies Lethal
Weapons To Ukraine" Breaking Defense, December 28, 2017,
<https://breakingdefense.com/2017/12/russia-will-retaliate-after-u-s-supplies-lethal-weapons-to-ukraine)//RP>

Last week, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [agreed to send lethal
defensive weapons to Ukraine.]{.underline} The order, packaged by the
State Department as an affirmation of Ukraine's right to defend itself
against Russian-backed aggression, was greeted on Capitol Hill as a
logical step in confronting what many lawmakers view as Vladimir Putin's
expansionist foreign policy. Proponents of this recommendation argue
that the bloodier Russia's nose becomes and the higher the death toll
for Russian soldiers on the battlefield, the more pressure Putin will be
under to cut ties with the outgunned and outmanned separatists. [The
prevailing logic]{.underline}, however, [is based on a hopeful theory of
how they hope Putin will respond.]{.underline} Moscow's conduct over the
three-and-a-half years of combat in Eastern Ukraine, however, should
lead to the exact opposite conclusion --- when push comes to shove, [the
Russians have proven to be willing to withstand the financial,
political, and military pain associated with preventing the total
military defeat of anti-Kiev forces. Russian officials
have]{.underline}, predictably, [denounced]{.underline} President
[Trump's authorization of lethal equipment to the
Ukrainians]{.underline} --- including the likely delivery of Javelin
anti-tank weapons, which could pulverize Russian armor--- [as an
aggressive act meant to deliberately **sabotage the Minsk peace
process**]{.underline}. While there is a possibility that Ukrainian
forces could use U.S.-supplied heavy weapons in an offensive capacity as
the Russians suggest, it is more likely that [this assistance will be
used by Moscow as an excuse to redouble its]{.underline} own [support to
Ukrainian proxies in Donetsk and Luhansk.]{.underline} The Russians have
demonstrated in word and in deed since they worked with proxies and
invaded in April 2014 that the Ukrainian government will not be
permitted to win the conflict militarily and reincorporate the Donbas
into the Ukrainian state. In the fall of 2014 and the winter of 2015,
when Ukrainian troops and pro-government armed battalions were engaging
Moscow's proxies in ferocious door-to-door, house-to-house fighting,
Russia escalated and forcefully stepped in, supplying personnel, tanks,
supplies, and reinforcements to beat back Kiev's advances. In Putin's
mind, allowing Ukraine to retake strategic territory was an unthinkable
prospect that would lead Kiev to believe that it could squash the
rebellion militarily. The infusion of Russian troops stopped Ukrainian
territorial advances in their tracks, at considerable human cost to
Kiev. In other words, [whenever pro-Russian militants were losing
ground]{.underline} or at risk, [Moscow turned on the spigot of
assistance to prevent a humiliating defeat]{.underline} or retreat.
[This is one of the biggest reminders to the world community that
Ukraine's political disposition is]{.underline} ultimately [far more
important to Russia's strategic interests than it is to
Washington's]{.underline}. No amount of U.S. military equipment or heavy
weapons systems is likely to eclipse what the Russians will provide to
the other side. [**To believe Russia will be intimidated into**
withdrawing its troops from Ukrainian territory or **suing
for**]{.underline} a [**peace** with a government Moscow sees as a
puppet of the West just because a few more of its soldiers have been
killed **is to place hope over the reality of Putin's track record**
throughout the war.]{.underline} Whether we in the United States or
Western Europe accept it as legitimate or not, Putin is highly motivated
to preserve Russian influence and freedom of movement in a country that
shares a 1,426-mile border with the Russian Federation. To allow Ukraine
to drift fully into Europe's orbit on his watch would be nothing short
of a personal political humiliation for Putin and, more important, a
geopolitical catastrophe for a Russia whose political elites remain
incredibly nervous about a shrinking Near Abroad and any hint of
political revolution in the former Soviet space. President Trump's
decision to increase U.S. military engagement in Ukraine's conflict
comes at a curious time, just three months after Putin broached the
prospect of an international peacekeeping mission for the very first
time and two days after Moscow, Kiev, and the separatists reaffirmed
their intention to call a holiday ceasefire and proceed toward an
"all-for-all" prisoner exchange. While dozens of ceasefires have come
and gone in Ukraine and a Russian-drafted peacekeeping proposal was far
below the threshold of what would be required to actually implement an
impartial peace in the Donbas, Putin's willingness to at least consider
it left a slim opening for European diplomats and U.S. Special
Representative Kurt Volker to explore options with their Russian
counterparts. [Washington's move to provide U.S. lethal weapons
stockpiles to the Ukrainians could have an **adverse impact on all of
these diplomatic processes**]{.underline}. [By throwing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [deeper into the Ukrainian
morass,]{.underline} President [Trump has taken the first giant step
toward further American involvement in the likely event that Moscow
escalates and the Ukrainian government asks for more
weapons.]{.underline} This is a frightening possibility, particularly
for Americans who would prefer not to intervene on behalf of a nation
that is not even a member of NATO and whose political direction is
irrelevant to America's policy in Europe. The unanswered questions are
nearly endless, and there is no sign the White House has even begun
thinking about them. What, for instance, is the U.S. objective in
Ukraine other than simply trying to bleed the Russians in a proxy
conflict? When --- not if --- Russia escalates, what would the Trump
administration do to counter it? How far is the U.S. willing to go to
frustrate Moscow's ambitions in a country it sees as an extension of its
former Soviet glory? What if Putin, in his desire to respond to what he
regards as American aggression in his own backyard, seeks to expand the
conflict by stirring up pro-Moscow sentiment among the Russian-speaking
populations of the Baltics? What would NATO do in that situation? Is
NATO even prepared for such a contingency? And if they are not, how is
any other Eastern European nation supposed to have any confidence in
NATO when the transatlantic alliance can't even defend its own members?
When you get down to the core of the matter, [the turbulent waters of

#### The treat of lethal weapons prevent effective negotiations

**Semchuk** 3-27-20**19** -- MPhil in Comparative Government @ Oxford,
PhD Candidate in Politics, University of Oxford (Liana, "Ukraine: US
arms sales making big business money while ordinary people pay the
price," *The Conversation*,
<https://theconversation.com/ukraine-us-arms-sales-making-big-business-money-while-ordinary-people-pay-the-price-114238)//BB>

Selling lethal weapons to Ukraine is the equivalent of pouring kerosene
onto a flame. But ongoing hostilities between Ukraine and Russia --
including the Kerch strait crisis, which began late last year when
Russia intercepted three Ukrainian vessels and took 24 crew members
captive -- are also a major business opportunity for the world's largest
defence contractors. Despite the risk of serious escalation, these
companies continue to provide Ukraine with lethal aid so it can defend
itself against Russia -- for a price, of course. The US special
representative for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, stated recently
that Washington remains committed to providing support to Ukraine and
its military, including anti-tank systems. He even hinted that [the US
is considering expanding the types of lethal aid that it could begin
selling to Ukraine,]{.underline} saying: "We also need to be looking at
things like air defence and coastal defence." This is a troubling
prospect. In March, US army general Curtis Scaparrotti said that the US
could also bolster the Ukrainian military's sniper capabilities.
Speaking to the Senate Armed Services Committee, he said: There are
other systems, sniper systems, ammunition and, perhaps looking at the
Kerch Strait, perhaps consideration for naval systems, as well, here in
the future as we move forward. This comment has been widely
underreported and has not received nearly as much attention as it
deserves considering the potential consequences. At worst, more [lethal
aid could escalate the conflict further]{.underline}. At best, it will
continue to keep alive a conflict that has already claimed more than
10,000 lives. [Finding a straightforward policy alternative is
difficult, but **sending more lethal aid** to achieve the unattainable
goal of Ukraine defeating Russia **is certainly no
solution**.]{.underline} Impact Despite attempts by Volker and
Scaparrotti to market the proposition as a way to help Ukraine defend
itself against Russia, the immediate benefits seem clearer to America's
weapons manufacturing sector than to Ukrainian civilians, who will
undoubtedly get caught in the crossfire. The Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute reported that the US is home to five of the
world's ten largest defence contractors. Lockheed Martin, by far the
largest in the field, in 2017 had an estimated US\$44.9 billion in arms
contracts globally. \*image removed, caption kept\* More weapons will
likely only inflame the conflict. Shutterstock The company was also
contracted (with Raytheon) in 2018 to provide Ukraine with Javelin
anti-tank missiles. The US Pentagon said: "The Javelin system will help
Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty
and territorial integrity in order to meet its national defense
requirements." But Lockheed Martin likely profited handsomely from the
deal. Meanwhile, the company's financial reports showed fourth quarter
2018 net sales of US\$14.4 billion, compared to US\$13.8 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2017. This year, the company is expecting sales to
grow by as much as 6%. This is unlikely to be the case if the number of
conflicts around the world declines. It's clear why Washington wants to
sell more weapons to Ukraine. But whether Ukraine remains receptive and
willing to continue buying them may hinge on the outcome of the upcoming
presidential election, which is scheduled for March 31. Presidential
candidate Volodymyr Zelensky, who is currently leading in the polls,
seems to offer hope that Ukraine may change its current strategy. This
is reflected in a statement Zelensky made in March in which he
emphasised the need to negotiate with Russia in order to "save people's
lives". Is there a solution? As well as better diplomacy, Zelensky also
sees direct democracy as a way to resolve the crisis. [Rather than
pursuing the same ineffective policy,]{.underline} which has achieved
absolutely nothing except for a greater death toll and growing human
misery[, he proposed a referendum on the outcome of his negotiations
with Russia on the conflict in eastern Ukraine.]{.underline} [This
approach might not lead to a quick fix or immediately restore peace in
the region -- but it is more likely to succeed than simply supplying
more weapons with which to prolong the fighting.]{.underline} [The West
should not abandon its rhetoric of support for Ukraine's territorial
integrity. But **policymakers**]{.underline} and society more broadly
[**should be careful not to assume that** simply **selling more
weapons** to Ukraine **will yield a definitive victory** over Russia and
its separatist allies.]{.underline} While the ongoing war in the eastern
Donbas region and the recent Kerch incident offer an opportunity for big
businesses to make a profit, it's ordinary people who will pay the
price. [The current approach to deescalating the conflict needs to be
dramatically reevaluated -- and **lethal weapons must be taken off the
negotiating table**.]{.underline}

### AT militias condition cp -- impact d \[or say yes\]

#### No impact -- Ukraine [successfully]{.underline} reined in militias

Security Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center.

Reined In Its Militias" Foreign Affairs, August 1, 2017,

When the conflict in Ukraine began in early 2014, a disturbing number of
armed groups---from looting gangs to militias with ties to European
white supremacy movements---sprang up from the chaos. [Although the role
and origin of those pro-Ukrainian militias has been hotly debated, one
thing is clear: several years after the start of the conflict, **the
Ukrainian government has managed to stifle the independent armed groups
fighting** on its side]{.underline}. [Its success offers lessons for
other countries attempting to demobilize populations after a
war.]{.underline}

At the start of the war in 2014, there were as many as 30 small armed
groups made up of 50 to 100 people. This assortment quickly consolidated
into five main militias: Right Sector, Azov, Aidar, Donbas, and Dnepr 1.
These semi-independent groups absorbed most of Ukraine's freelance
fighters and small ethnic militias. Although each group had its own
leadership, logistics, and funding, they had to negotiate access to the
frontline with the Ukrainian government, and they depended on the
regular army for artillery cover. Many of the volunteer fighters were
internally displaced people from eastern Ukraine and Crimea, although
some Russian far-right activists came to participate in the fight.

At the start of the war, when Ukraine's standing army was weak and slow
to mobilize, such groups were crucial to the defense of the territory.
However, even from the start, there were major problems with their
operations. They rarely coordinated with each other or the Ukrainian
army on the battlefield or off. Furthermore, there was no legal
supervision of their activities, as Amnesty International has repeatedly
pointed out.

The lack of coordination led to inefficiency and, sometimes,
catastrophe. In August 2014, Aidar, which consisted of freelance
fighters from the Lugansk region who joined after the Maidan protests
and who had little military skill, failed to coordinate operations with
the Ukrainian army in Lugansk in the infamous Battle of Illovaisk. The
army and several other volunteer battalions, including forces from
Donbas, another autonomous pro-Ukrainian armed group, were overrun; more
than 1,000 fighters were killed, about 100 were injured, and 128 were
taken prisoner. The lack of coordination is often cited as a main cause
of the disaster.

These problems on the ground, pressure from the international community,
and [concerns that these independent armed groups might themselves grow
into destabilizing opponents alarmed the central government in Kiev and
spurred it to act.]{.underline} [**The government drew a line:** all
independent pro-Ukrainian paramilitary groups would either join the
official armed forces or face demobilization by any means necessary. The
Ukrainian government acted at the right time---that is, when its army
was strong and public opinion was on its side]{.underline}. Many
governments facing similar problems either miss the right moment or
provoke infighting during incorporation.

[The first group to be incorporated was the 500-person Azov battalion.
The group's leader, Arsen Avakov, had been the Ukrainian minister of
internal affairs since 2014]{.underline}. The Azov fighters acquiesced
peacefully, having always anticipated a merger with the army. After the
union, [the government's first act was to root out two groups within
Azov, foreign fighters and neo-Nazis, by **vetting group members with
background checks**, observations during training, and a law requiring
all fighters to accept Ukrainian citizenship]{.underline}. Fighters who
did not pass this screening were offered the chance to join civilian
volunteer corps to help the war effort; these corps assisted police,
cleared snow (a crucial task in Ukraine), and even worked on a public
radio.

[The Donbas paramilitary was also peacefully incorporated into the
official army]{.underline}. The group had been in flux since the autumn
of 2014, [when a disagreement among the group's leadership broke out;
the Ukrainian government exploited the rift, and Donbas
disintegrated.]{.underline} [Some of its fighters simply demobilized,
whereas others found their way to official Ukrainian recruitment centers
and enlisted.]{.underline}

[The remaining three groups resisted giving up their independence, so
the government took a carrot-and-stick approach]{.underline}. In spring
2015, it issued an ultimatum. [Independent groups were ordered to
withdraw from the front line; any that did so could enlist with the
armed forces with full benefits, such as salaries, insurance, subsidized
utilities, and medical care---none of which had been provided by most
independent armed groups]{.underline}. **[The government lived up to
this promise]{.underline}**. [Any independent fighters who did not
withdraw from the front lines would be treated as illegal fighters and
find themselves in jail.]{.underline}

[Kiev nearly had to make good on its threats in March 2016]{.underline}.
Several fighters from the armed group Tornado, a group with known
connections to criminal circles, refused to join official Ukrainian
armed forces; in fact, they barricaded themselves in a school in
Severodonetsk and promised to open fire if the army approached. [With
the help of negotiators, however, the stand-off was resolved. Some
**group members demobilized, some were arrested, and some joined the
National Guard.**]{.underline}

The most challenging case was Aidar, the last pro-Ukrainian paramilitary
to be incorporated. According to their leader, Serhiy Melnichuk, [the
government responded to Aidar's intransigence with varying tactics: the
Ukrainian army opened fire on the group at the front line, as it had
threatened to do]{.underline}. However, [the government also filed a
lawsuit against the group's leadership]{.underline}. [These tactics were
successful, and Aidar's fighters are now part of the organized Ukrainian
army.]{.underline}

After Aidar's incorporation into the regular forces, most of Ukraine's
pro-Ukrainian paramilitary fighters were under government control.
However, holdouts remain: some fighters refused to sign enlistment
contracts, and they simply kept switching from one independent armed
group to another. Many of these fighters wound up in the last sizable
paramilitary, Right Sector. Right Sector is active in the field. In the
summer of 2016, four fighters were killed and 13 were wounded fighting
for Ukraine during the battle in Avdeevka. None of these casualties were
soldiers from the standing Ukrainian army.

Although Right Sector is a small group, it will be the hardest of all to
bring in line. Despite threats from the government and standing offers
to join official armed forces, the group is still semi-independent. At
this point, it is composed of fighters who have made their devotion to
staying independent very clear. They are not tempted by the benefits
offered by the government. Their reasons for rejecting incorporation are
varied; one group member who refused to enlist in the official army said
that "Right Sector is more professional and cohesive than an official
army."

[Ukraine's campaign to integrate independent armed groups has been
successful so far. Almost all the groups integrated, and the groups'
members have become functional parts of the Ukrainian armed forces,
preventing the potential for separate, chaotic chains of
command]{.underline}. Perhaps other countries facing the proliferation
of independent armed groups, such as Iraq, might consider similar
solutions---reversing public opinion, pressuring groups' leaders, and
offering enlistment benefits to lower-level group members---when dealing
with allies they cannot control.

#### No impact -- don't pose an imminent threat, but they have cultivated ties with powerful political leaders 

-- proves "say no" argument because political leaders support militias,
but also proves there is no impact as per the bottom of the evidence --
probably a double turn

**Morgan 18** -- a Masters student in Russian and Post-Soviet Politics
at University College London (UCL) where he focuses on Russian foreign
and security policies with a particular focus on its cyberwarfare
elements. (Nicholas, "The challenge of far-right Ukrainian militias"
Global Risk Insights, December 16, 2018,
https://globalriskinsights.com/2018/12/challenge-far-right-ukrainian-militias)//RP

Many groups, most recently the National Militia, have openly marched in
public in militarized displays. Several leaders of the Ukrainian
far-right have also been elected to parliament in previous elections.
These organizations and their members have a well-documented history of
using violence against their ideological enemies in Ukraine. In fact,
their leaders have expressed explicitly xenophobic sentiments against
ethnic minorities and LGBT individuals. These individuals have acted as
vigilantes with impunity in some of their actions.

Therefore, an important question remains -- [How do these organisations
endanger Ukraine's future stability?]{.underline}

From the Donbas to the home front

The Ukrainian Army fell back in disarray at the start of the war by
Russian backed separatists' seizure of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions
in 2014. Former President Viktor Yanukovych neglected the armed forces
for years. An alternative was arranged to help the state maintain its
territotiral integrity. Hence, a number of volunteer battalions were
raised to battle the separatists and prevent a total collapse of
Ukraine.

Currently, [the military has regrouped]{.underline}. The army and
security services have absorbed a number of these former militias. Many
of them support interior forces conduct law enforcement activities. And
a faction perform rearguard duties at the fronts.

[This arrangement]{.underline} in which private organizations [may
provide assistance to law enforcement]{.underline} authorities is
grounded in the "law on the participation of citizens in the protection
of public order and the state border" passed by the Ukrainian Rada in
2005. [Militia members have acted against numerous criminal
activities]{.underline}. These include illegal gambling, public order
and other offenses, all ostensibly in coordination with the National
Police.

In spite of this legal sanctioning, there are a plethora of cases in
which militia members have acted more according to their own interests
than that of law enforcement. For example, there are instances in which
militia members have interrupted sessions of local councils to force
politicians to vote on measures at gunpoint. They have attacked LGBT
activists, and Neo-Nazi group C14 targeted supporters of a slain
journalist at a rally. In many of these cases, members have not been
arrested and have not seen their cooperation with authorities suspended
despite their vigilante actions.

Legal and political impunity

Inside Ukraine, [far-right groups have not proved to be successful in
winning elections or wider public support]{.underline}. According to the
International Republican Institute, the party Right Sector wields less
than 1% support among those surveyed and the National Corpus Party,
associated with National Militia, has not performed any better. [In
spite of their weak electoral prospects, **these groups have managed to
cultivate ties with more powerful political factions.** The most
noteworthy relationship being the People's Front party of Interior
Minister Arsen Avakov.]{.underline}

Avakov's party is presently in a ruling coalition with President Petro
Poroshenko's ruling Bloc. He commands the forces of the National Guard
and National Police. The Interior Minister has well-known ties to the
far-right including the Azov Battalion and has appointed Vadim Troyan, a
former Azov member, as his deputy. [With a constellation of figures
placed in positions of power, it could explain why far-right militia
members feel that they may act with impunity as they direct violence
against those they oppose.]{.underline} There seems to be a severe lack
of accountability.

This arrangement may contribute to lax responses by authorities to
far-right violence and contribute to their sense of exemption. When
National Militia members assaulted protestors on February 4th 2018, none
of the attackers were held to account whereas police detained a number
of activists instead. That in itself is a violation of Ukraine's laws
against attacking participants in a civil assembly, but the militia
escaped being held responsible.

2019 election & the Far-Right

Ukraine is going to see a new set of elections in 2019 for both the
presidency and parliament. It is unlikely that either Poroshenko or his
main challenger Yuliya Tymoshenko will make any moves against the
activities of the far-right.

The most prominent reason is that both politicians and their parties are
not particularly popular among Ukrainians. Voters express pessimism
about their future under either candidate. While in theory, the
President can utilize the security services more aggressively to
counteract the far-right. However, this is an unlikely option. The
militias have many veterans of the Donbas war in their ranks. These
individuals command great respect from Ukrainians for defending the
state from Russian separatists. Neither candidate or their respective
parties may have the tenacity to weather the likely political backlash.

Another challenge to reining in the militia's excesses has to do with
Avakov. Poroshenko's ruling coalition in the Rada relies on members of
Avakov's People's Front to maintain its majority and while Avakov
himself is even less popular than Poroshenko, there is no immediate
replacement partner. Additionally, Avakov could easily position his
forces, official and non-official, on the side of any protests against
Poroshenko, depriving him of legitimacy and risking a forced
resignation.

Tymoshenko has expressed no interest in replacing the interior minister
on the campaign trail despite his massive unpopularity. This could also
be political given her past membership of the old political organization
under Yanukovych. There is a fear of him potentially revealing
politically compromising information pertaining to her. This could be
damaging for her potential government.

The potential threat

**[The aggression and boldness of the militias do not pose an imminent
threat to the current government]{.underline}**. However, the long term
sustainability of this situation is unclear.

Current Status

Today the only groups of this sort that are not legally subordinated to
government bodies are those linked to Right Sector (Pravy Sektor), known
for ultra-rightwing symbolism and rhetoric. [Right Sector and other
battalions affiliated with founder Dmytro Yarosh]{.underline} (who
officially withdrew from Right Sector itself in 2016) [continue to fight
on behalf of Ukraine in the East]{.underline}. But in July 2015 they
also engaged in an armed battle in the West, in the town of Mukacheve
near the Hungarian border, against Ukrainian military and police forces
in a dispute over cigarette smuggling routes. Right Sector later
continued the fight by setting up a roadblock outside Kyiv to demand the
ouster of Ukraine's Interior Minister --- and its members have also
regularly threatened Ukraine's LGBTQ communities. Ukrainian President
Petro Poroshenko demanded that Right Sector disarm after the 2015
confrontation. But as of mid-2017 [they continue to **coordinate with
Ukrainian security forces**, ostensibly while pursuing formal
integration.]{.underline} Meanwhile other groups' legal subordination
masks their substantial autonomy and political activism. Our incomplete
inventory includes [the Azov Battalion]{.underline}, also associated
with rightwing ideology. It has been state-affiliated since 2014, and
[is currently a **unit of the Ukrainian National Guard**. It also
retains an active political arm and its commander and founder, Andriy
Biletsky, is a member of parliament]{.underline}. The Azov website
advises new candidates to join the Guard and then request a transfer to
Azov. The Azov battalion was recently featured in a laudatory article in
the Kyiv Post, an English-language newspaper widely read by expat and
diaspora communities. [The founder and commander-in-chief of another
battalion, Yuri Bereza of the locally based Dnipro-1]{.underline} (now a
police unit), [is also a **member of parliament**]{.underline}. The
Dnipro-1 website actively recruits new members via a telephone number.
The Aidar Battalion, accused of war crimes by Amnesty International, is
now the 24th Assault Battalion of Ukraine's Armed Forces --- even as its
former leader (and member of parliament) Sergei Melnichuk faces criminal
charges. And the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), which
takes its name from a 20th-century organization accused of
anti-Semitism, has partially integrated as a subunit of the 93rd
Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces, under the leadership of Andriy
Pastusheno, the OUN's deputy commander. The OUN, too, maintains a web
and social media presence for fundraising and political activism. [The
Donbas Battalion, now formally under the National Guard]{.underline},
maintains a similar online and social media fundraising presence. [Its
founder, Semen Semenchenko, is also a member of parliament]{.underline},
although in June some members of the Donbas battalion broke with him
amid accusations of criminality. Aidar was at its inception openly
funded by billionaire oligarch and former Dnipro region governor Ihor
Kolomoisky. Kolomoisky is also rumored to have funded the Donbas and
Dnipro-1 battalions. He currently heads the Ukrainian Association of
Patriots, a nationalist party that holds two parliamentary seats, even
as he holds triple citizenship with Cyprus and Israel and faces constant
accusations of tax evasion and corruption. The Pros and Cons [The
**Ukrainian government** has an understandable **desire to maintain good
relations with the volunteer battalions'** powerful patrons and leaders,
especially since **several are now popular legislators**]{.underline}.
[Ukraine also has reason to be grateful to volunteer fighters, causing
those who might otherwise have doubts to excuse their unsavory
politicization.]{.underline} Ironically, volunteer veterans have had to
undertake legal battles to receive medical treatment and other support
from the state, while continuing to rely on battalion organizations for
help.

[Separatists? Fascists? Disguised Russian special forces?]{.underline}
Theories have multiplied to explain who exactly the armed men who have
wrested control of parts of Donetsk, Luhansk (Lugansk in Russian), and
other areas of eastern Ukraine from the Ukrainian state, cutting its
residents off also from participation in the recent presidential
elections. Very likely, martial law will follow in the region upon
completion of the transfer of presidential powers to Ukraine's newly
elected leader, Petro Poroshenko. [The separatist forces have clearly
exposed the limits of Kiev's capacity to govern]{.underline}, and [in so
doing they have acted in accordance with Russian state interests and
swelled the waves of anti-state violence presently engulfing eastern and
southern Ukraine.]{.underline} But these facts alone do not mean that
those armed men are simply Russian agents, or even Russian-trained
militias. Instead, alongside Russia, [the forces of the "Donetsk
People's Republic" and the "Lugansk People's Republic" serve **first and
foremost what we call a mafia state.**]{.underline} The idea itself is
not new. It gained currency particularly in reference to Russia in the
wake of WikiLeaks, which disclosed the details of a January 2010
briefing by Spanish prosecutor José Grinda González---one of Europe's
top experts on organized crime---analyzing Russia as a "virtual mafia
state." One year later, British journalist Luke Harding published Mafia
State, a memoir detailing the intimidation and Cold War spy-game-like
scare tactics that he faced at the hands of Russian secret services
while he was The Guardian's bureau chief in Moscow, an assignment that
ended when Russia denied him re-entry in 2011. In recent months,
commentators have increasingly---and rightly---pointed out the need to
think about Ukraine not just as a state, but also as the sum of its
regions. Here the "mafia state" idea can help us to understand the
events of recent months, especially the perverse phenomenon of the
separatist militia-driven "people's republics" of the Donbas. Even
allowing for the distinctiveness of Soviet legal culture, "rule of law"
as such was a myth in the Donbas even before the Soviet collapse.
Combine might-trumps-right with the long-standing culture of anomie and
graft classically described by Aleksandr Zinoviev as Homo Sovieticus,
and you can see that the mafias and "people's republics" of Donetsk and
Luhansk have been decades in the making. Writing for The New Republic
more than a decade ago, Princeton historian Stephen Kotkin provocatively
dubbed much of the post-Soviet space "Trashcanistan"---"a dreadful
checkerboard of parasitic states and statelets, government-led extortion
rackets and gangs in power, mass refugee camps, and shadow economies."
Instead of Communist Party nomenklatura calling the shots, a parallel
power structure developed in the 1980s and 1990s in the form of a client
system of black-market privateers and underworld bosses operating on a
dramatic scale. [Welcome to the Donbas. The violence, political
parasitism, and mafia life undergirding the region's present chaos have
been present since even before the Soviet Union's dissolution in
1991]{.underline}. This is how the Donbas and its neighboring Dnieper
region have produced many of Ukraine's wealthiest magnates and top
national politicians, with the former group feeding the latter courtesy
of post-Soviet Ukraine's wealthiest citizen, Rinat Akhmetov; its former
presidents Viktor Yanukovych and Leonid Kuchma; and even its Orange
Revolution prime minister and---until recently---Yanukovych's political
prisoner, Yulia Tymoshenko. At a time when the disintegrating Soviet
Union made overnight oligarchs out of former nomenklatura in a process
described by political scientist Steven L. Solnick as "stealing the
state," [the Donbas's magnates]{.underline}---some criminals already
under Soviet law---**[prevented the rule of law from emerging in the
Donbas and severely limited the formation of a civil
society.]{.underline}** If you visit today\'s Donetsk, Luhansk, or
Slovyansk, you can find parks, playgrounds, and cultural life.
Sometimes, it is entirely possible to forget the violence that has
become endemic to the region. Yet, for many in the Donbas, life is---and
for decades has been---nasty, brutish, and short. Yanukovych's electoral
triumph in 2010 on the heels of the implosion of the Orange Revolution
coalition papered over this state of affairs. Years before the Soviet
Union collapsed, the Donbas was already a case study in failed
governance, controlled by neither Kiev nor Moscow---in other words, part
of Trashcanistan. [In the first decade of Ukrainian independence, the
Donbas had the highest level of criminal activity in all of
Ukraine]{.underline}. Between 1990 and 1993, total crime in the Donetsk
region increased by 50 percent. In 1991 alone, the Donetsk police
department fingered 2,186 criminal groups, which at that time had
committed over 4,000 alleged crimes, including 33 murders, 212
robberies, 173 cases of extortion, and so on. **[Since 1991, the number
of organized criminal groups identified by law enforcement agencies has
increased steadily.]{.underline}**

as between Riyadh and Tehran, Islamabad and New Delhi, and on the Korean
Peninsula. Governance shortfalls also will drive threat perceptions and
insecurity in countries such as Pakistan and North Korea. Economic
interdependence among major powers remains a check on aggressive
behavior but might be insufficient in itself to prevent a future
conflict. Major and middle powers alike will search for ways to reduce
the types of interdependence that leaves them vulnerable to economic
coercion and financial sanctions, potentially providing them more
freedom of action to aggressively pursue their interests. Meanwhile, the
threat from terrorism is likely to expand as the ability of states,
groups, and individuals to impose harm diversifies. The net effect of
rising tensions within and between countries---and the growing threat
from terrorism---will be greater global disorder and considerable

#### Warlording is super non-unique\-\--they've been around since 2014

#### Crackdowns are [worse]{.underline} for ethical imperative\-\--empowers more violence

Washington, "How should we protest neo-Nazis? Lessons from German
history", The Conversation, August 21 2017,
https://theconversation.com/how-should-we-protest-neo-nazis-lessons-from-german-history-82645

After the murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, many people are
asking themselves what they should do if Nazis rally in their city.
[Should they put their bodies on the line in counterdemonstrations? Some
say yes. **History says no**]{.underline}. Take it from me: I study the
original Nazis. [We have an ethical obligation to stand against fascism
and racism. **But we also have an ethical obligation to do so in a way
that doesn't help the fascists and racists more than it hurts
them.**]{.underline} History repeats itself Charlottesville was right
out of the Nazi playbook. In the 1920s, the Nazi Party was just one
political party among many in a democratic system, running for seats in
Germany's Parliament. For most of that time, it was a small, marginal
group. In 1933, riding a wave of popular support, it seized power and
set up a dictatorship. The rest is well-known. It was in 1927, while
still on the political fringes, that the Nazi Party scheduled a rally in
a decidedly hostile location -- the Berlin district of Wedding. Wedding
was so left-of-center that the neighborhood had the nickname "Red
Wedding," red being the color of the Communist Party. The Nazis often
held rallies right where their enemies lived, to provoke them. The
people of Wedding were determined to fight back against fascism in their
neighborhood. On the day of the rally, hundreds of Nazis descended on
Wedding. Hundreds of their opponents showed up too, organized by the
local Communist Party. The antifascists tried to disrupt the rally,
heckling the speakers. Nazi thugs retaliated. There was a massive brawl.
Almost 100 people were injured. I imagine the people of Wedding felt
they had won that day. They had courageously sent a message: Fascism was
not welcome. But historians believe events like the rally in Wedding
helped the Nazis build a dictatorship. Yes, the brawl got them media
attention. But what was far, far more important was how it fed an
escalating spiral of street violence. That violence helped the fascists
enormously. Violent confrontations with antifascists gave the Nazis a
chance to paint themselves as the victims of a pugnacious, lawless left.
They seized it. It worked. We know now that many Germans supported the
fascists because they were terrified of leftist violence in the streets.
Germans opened their morning newspapers and saw reports of clashes like
the one in Wedding. It looked like a bloody tide of civil war was rising
in their cities. Voters and opposition politicians alike came to believe
the government needed special police powers to stop violent leftists.
Dictatorship grew attractive. The fact that the Nazis themselves were
fomenting the violence didn't seem to matter. One of Hitler's biggest
steps to dictatorial power was to gain emergency police powers, which he
claimed he needed to suppress leftist violence. Thousands of Nazi storm
troops demonstrate in a Communist neighborhood in Berlin on Jan. 22,
1933. Thirty-five Nazis, Communists and police were injured during
clashes. AP Photo The left takes the heat In the court of public
opinion, accusations of mayhem and chaos in the streets will, as a rule,
tend to stick against the left, not the right. This was true in Germany
in the 1920s. It was true even when opponents of fascism acted in
self-defense or tried to use relatively mild tactics, such as heckling.
It is true in the United States today, where even peaceful rallies
against racist violence are branded riots in the making. Today, right
extremists are going around the country staging rallies just like the
one in 1927 in Wedding. According to the civil rights advocacy
organization the Southern Poverty Law Center, they pick places where
they know antifascists are present, like university campuses. They come
spoiling for physical confrontation. Then they and their allies spin it
to their advantage. A demonstration on the University of Washington
campus where far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was giving a speech
on Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren I watched this very
thing happen steps from my office on the University of Washington
campus. Last year, a right extremist speaker came. He was met by a
counterprotest. One of his supporters shot a counterprotester. On stage,
in the moments after the shooting, the right extremist speaker claimed
that his opponents had sought to stop him from speaking "by killing
people." The fact that it was one of the speaker's supporters, a right
extremist and Trump backer, who engaged in what prosecutors now claim
was an unprovoked and premeditated act of violence, has never made
national news. We saw this play out after Charlottesville, too.
President Donald Trump said there was violence "on both sides." It was
an incredible claim. Heyer, a peaceful protester, and 19 other people
were intentionally hit by a neo-Nazi driving a car. He seemed to portray
Charlottesville as another example of what he has referred to elsewhere
as "violence in our streets and chaos in our communities," including, it
seems, Black Lives Matter, which is a nonviolent movement against
violence. He stirred up fear. Trump recently said that police are too
constrained by existing law. President Trump tried it again during the
largely peaceful protests in Boston -- he called the tens of thousands
who gathered there to protest racism and Nazism "anti-police agitators,"
though later, in a characteristic about-face, he praised them. President
Trump's claims are hitting their mark. A CBS News poll found that a
majority of Republicans thought his description of who was to blame for
the violence in Charlottesville was "accurate." This violence, and the
rhetoric about it coming from the administration, are echoes -- faint
but nevertheless frightening echoes -- of a well-documented pattern, a
pathway by which democracies devolve into dictatorships. The Antifa
There's an additional wrinkle: the antifa. When Nazis and white
supremacists rally, the antifa are likely to show up, too. "Antifa" is
short for antifascists, though the name by no means includes everyone
who opposes fascism. The antifa is a relatively small movement of the
far left, with ties to anarchism. It arose in Europe's punk scene in the
1980s to fight neo-Nazism. The antifa says that because Nazism and white
supremacy are violent, we must use any means necessary to stop them.
This includes physical means, like what they did on my campus: forming a
crowd to block ticket-holders from entering a venue to hear a right
extremist speak. The antifa's tactics often backfire, just like those of
Germany's communist opposition to Nazism did in the 1920s.
Confrontations escalate. Public opinion often blames the left no matter
the circumstances. What to do? One solution: [Hold a counterevent that
**doesn't involve physical proximity to the right
extremists**]{.underline}. The Southern Poverty Law Center has published
a helpful guide. Among its recommendations: If the alt-right rallies,
"organize a joyful protest" well away from them. Ask people they have
targeted to speak. But "as hard as it may be to resist yelling at
alt-right speakers, do not confront them." [This does not mean ignoring
Nazis. It means standing up to them in a way that **denies them a chance
for bloodshed.** The cause Heather Heyer died for is **best defended by
avoiding the physical confrontation that the people who are responsible
for her death want.**]{.underline}

### AT militias -- 2nc 'peace now' run

#### Absolutely not

Adam **Lammon 6/27**/19, assistant managing editor at the National
Interest, graduate of George Washington University\'s Elliott School of
International Affairs, "Will Ukraine Begin a New Dialogue With Moscow?",
National Interest, June 27 2019,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/will-ukraine-begin-new-dialogue-moscow-64606

[Is there a possibility for a fresh start in Ukraine that would push
for]{.underline} a fight against corruption, reforms, and a [dialogue
with Moscow]{.underline}---all of which polls indicate are backed by the
vast majority of voters who supported the candidacy of Volodymyr
Zelensky for the presidency? A luncheon discussion at the Center for the
National Interest on Thursday surveyed whether Zelensky will indeed be
able to translate his electoral success into a breakthrough on
negotiations with Russia. [The panelists were Samuel Charap, a senior
political scientist at the RAND Corporation who has served on the Policy
Planning staff during the Obama administration, Keith Darden, an
associate professor at American University's School of International
Service, and Jacob Heilbrunn, the editor of the National
Interest]{.underline}. The [event was moderated by George Beebe, vice
president and director of studies at the Center for the National
Interest, and a former chief Russia analysis at the CIA as well as a
White House aide during the George W. Bush administration.]{.underline}
While a **[settlement currently remains a distant
aspiration]{.underline}**, the panelists had mostly good news to share
about Europe's most fractious conflict. It is "remarkable," said Keith
Darden, that, after five years of war, Ukraine is "not dealing with a
Balkans scenario, where war has polarized the Ukrainian population and
has made reconciliation impossible." He continued: "In many ways, this
election put the lie to the caricature that was circulating about
Ukraine both here and in European capitals, which was that a country
that was united in its resistance to Russia---engaging in consensual
nation-building, reviving its national language, creating a unified
Orthodox church that was autocephalous and separated from Moscow, and
working as hard as it possibly could to separate itself from the Russian
Federation and unwilling to yield . . . on its territorial integrity or
on any matters of potential compromise with the Russian aggressors."
Instead, Darden said, what we are seeing is that "the Ukrainian people
have positive attitudes toward Russia," and retain "brotherly"
sentiments towards the Russian people. To support this assertion, as
well as to lend credibility to Zelensky's push for reconciliation with
Russia, Charap referred to public polling in Ukraine that suggested a
softening of views among the Ukrainian people. According to Charap, a
May poll found that "75 percent of Ukrainians are in favor of direct
negotiations with Russia for restoring peace to the Donbass" and "55
percent are in direct negotiations with separatist leaders for the same
purpose." Further polling reported that "65 percent of respondents said
that Ukraine should make compromises in order to restore peace and
return lost territories" to Ukraine and that "about 50 percent of
Ukrainians support giving autonomy to the separatist regions in order to
achieve a settlement," which Charap noted is "one of the conditions of
the Minsk agreements." [Yet while Zelensky was elected on a platform of
compromise with Russia and public support seems to be firmly on his
side, other **problems restricting his political latitude
remain**]{.underline}. Referring to an incident where the [Ukrainian
foreign minister rejected a Russian proposal to negotiate over Ukrainian
sailors detained in the Kerch Strait]{.underline} crisis without
informing the president, [Charap said that Zelensky "**doesn't really
have full control over his own government**."]{.underline} This
sentiment extends beyond the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
the Ukrainian parliament, known as the Verkhovna Rada, as well. Since
this Rada was elected under the previous president, Petro Poroshenko, in
the immediate aftermath of the Euromaidan protests in 2014, Darden
contends that it is now "completely unrepresentative of the population
and popular attitudes at this point and are almost universally going to
be thrown out of their seats" during the next election on July 21. Thus
far, these [internal dynamics have made Zelensky less effective than he
could otherwise be, **creating the perception in Moscow that the
Ukrainian leader is not in a position to negotiate fundamental
changes**]{.underline} to the status quo, even if he could be later in
the summer. Furthermore, Charap observed, [Russia is **aware** that on
most key foreign-policy issues, Zelensky's positions are "**largely the
same" as those of his more anti-Russia predecessor**]{.underline}. Under
Zelensky, [Ukraine has neither changed its stance on favoring European
Union and NATO membership, nor its more general concerns with Russian
foreign policy]{.underline} or its opposition to the German-Russian Nord
Stream 2 pipeline. Turning to European perceptions and the Ukrainian
relationship with Europe, Heilbrunn said that Zelensky should not feel
confident with recent European moves to begin a process of Russian
reintegration into the continent. For Heilbrunn, the drivers of this
reintegration are twofold. First, as epitomized by Moscow's return to
the Council of Europe, some Europeans---especially in France, Germany,
and Italy---want to improve relations with Russia to restart bilateral
trade. Offering the example of Germany, Heilbrunn reported that "87
percent of the members of the Russian-German chamber of commerce
indicated that they want Merkel to take a more active role in promoting
economic activity with Moscow." The second driver is the United States
and the Trump administration. According to Heilbrunn, Donald Trump's
targeted rhetoric on the United States' European allies, such as calling
Germany a "captive of Russia" over the Nord Stream 2 deal, is pushing
some European countries like Germany and France to "crabwalk" towards
more independence from America. Much like how Germany and France are
permitting Russia back into the European political architecture, Beebe
said that the United States is following a similar path: "President
Trump had canceled a planned meeting with President \[Vladimir\] Putin
several months ago specifically over Russia's detention of the Ukrainian
seaman, saying that he would not meet with Putin until such time as
those seaman had been returned, and yet this meeting is going on
nonetheless, although Russia continues to detain them." Noting that
[Russia has an **outsized and decisive influence** over the Ukrainian
separatists operating in the Donbass]{.underline}, Christopher Anderson,
a U.S. State Department employee who worked with the U.S. Special
Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker, asked "[**What more can be
done** to get peace \[between Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}\] . . .
\[[given\] Russia's goal to have an autonomous republic of Donetsk and
Luhansk with a veto over Ukrainian foreign policy]{.underline}?"

In 2014, the Republican Congress passed the loftily named Ukrainian
Freedom Support Act, which permitted the sale of lethal weapons to
Ukraine. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law, but as The
Washington Post reported, he "never authorized large commercial or
government sales, a move widely seen as a de facto decision not to
provide lethal weapons to the Ukraine military." That policy has now
changed, as President Donald [Trump has approved a **large commercial
sale** of weapons to the former Soviet state, where the fight against
Russia-backed militants in the east has intensified lately]{.underline}.
"The move was heavily supported by top Trump national security Cabinet

To Buy Patriot Missiles As It Delivers A Mobile Radar To The U.S. Army"

https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/23351/ukraine-requests-to-buy-patriot-missiles-as-it-delivers-a-mobile-radar-to-the-u-s-army)//RP

[Ukraine is looking to purchase]{.underline} a small number of
[surface-to-air missile systems from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [possibly Patriots, amid a **recent spike in
tensions** with separatists in]{.underline} the country's eastern
[Donbas]{.underline} region, as well as their chief backer, Russia. The
move also comes as [the U.S. government is expanding arms deals
with]{.underline} the government in [Kiev]{.underline}, including the
sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles, and has even recently bought a
Ukrainian air defense radar for its own analysis and training use.

On Aug. 28, 2018, [Ukrainian Ambassador]{.underline} to the United
States Valeriy Chaly [explained his country's desire to buy]{.underline}
unspecified [American-made air defense weapons]{.underline} in an
interview with the country's Radio NV. Chaly said that Ukraine's
President Petro Poroshenko had raised the matter directly with U.S.
President Donald Trump during a brief meeting the two had in Brussels on
the sidelines of the NATO summit in July 2018. He also said that
authorities in Kiev had discussed the possible purchase separately with
U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton.

"[Ukraine has requested to official Washington for a possible sale of
air defense systems worth **\$750 million for one unit**,"]{.underline}
Chaly told Radio NV, according to a translation from Defence Blog. "If
necessary, [\[Ukraine could purchase\] **at least three** appropriate
**military complexes** for the Ukrainian army."]{.underline}

Though Chaly did not say what American-made air defense system Ukraine
was interested in acquiring, the figures he outlined would be well in
line with Raytheon\'s Patriot surface-to-air missile system. Earlier in
2018, the U.S. government approved the sale of four Patriot Advanced
Capability-3+ (PAC-3+) systems to Sweden in a deal worth a total of
approximately \$3.2 billion. This would mean [each system cost \$800
million]{.underline}, but it is worth noting that the complete package
included training and other support services and ancillary equipment
that would not be part of the base system's unit cost.

In addition, that [Ukraine is]{.underline} only [interested in buying
three complete systems]{.underline} at most [points to a **longer-range
and** more **strategically-focused system**, such as
Patriot]{.underline}. This would be an impractical number of short- or
medium-range systems, which require much greater density to be useful
across a broad front.

[**Officials** in Kiev]{.underline} could also [be **looking at**
the]{.underline} [Medium Extended Air Defense System (**MEADS**), which
American defense contractor Lockheed Martin makes]{.underline} in
cooperation with the European missile consortium MBDA. MEADS can already
fire the latest Patriot PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE)
interceptor and Lockheed and MBDA are pitching it as a modular system
that could accommodate other missile types in the future.

Regardless, adding a modern long-range surface-to-air missile system
such as Patriot to Ukraine's arsenal would significantly bolster the
country's air defenses and help counter increasing threats from Russia.
Patriot's ballistic missile defense capabilities, in particular, could
be an important challenge to Russian Iskander ballistic missiles
situated on the Crimean Peninsula, which the Kremlin illegally seized
from Ukraine in 2014. Earlier in 2018, Russia also deployed aircraft
capable of carrying the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile,
an Iskander derivative, to its Southern Military District, another move
that seemed to be, in part, a signal aimed at the government in Kiev.

Patriot has gotten a good chance to demonstrate its capabilities,
especially in the ballistic missile defense role, recently in Saudi
Arabia. The Saudis have had to employ these surface-to-air missile
systems on many occasions to defend their cities against ballistic
missile attacks from Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen.

The threat posed by Russia\'s Iskander in general, as well as ballistic
missile developments elsewhere, especially in North Korea, have led to a
certain renaissance for Patriot around the world, especially in
combination with the improved capabilities that Lockheed Martin\'s PAC-3
MSE interceptor offers, which you can read about in more detail here.
There is also work in progress on finding ways to reduce the cost of
each missile. Romania and Poland, in addition to Sweden, are in the
process of acquiring Patriots now and, if Ukraine is any indication,
there could be more sales to come in the near future.

At present, the Ukrainian military relies on older Soviet-era iterations
of the S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile system for high-altitude,
long-range air defense. Earlier in 2018, it also reactivated a small
number of S-300V systems, which are more geared toward defending against
tactical ballistic missiles.

Since at least the beginning of August 2018, there have been increasing
fears that Russian-backed separatists, again supported by actual Russian
troops, might be positioning themselves for a renewed offensive in
eastern Ukraine. This, in turn, may have driven Ukrainian officials to
look for additional ways to bolster its defenses against a more overt
Kremlin intervention into the conflict. The assassination of Alexander
Zakharchenko, a major rebel leader, by unknown parties on Aug. 31, 2018,
has only further inflamed tensions, as we at The War Zone recently
explored in detail.

If the U.S. government was to approve the sale of a system such as
Patriot to Ukraine, it could similarly reflect an even more significant
shift in Washington's military cooperation country. The surface-to-air
missile systems would be, by far, the most advanced weapons the United
States had ever sold to Ukraine.

President [Trump's]{.underline} administration's [decision to
green-light the sale Javelin anti-tank guided missiles to Ukraine
was]{.underline} already [a **major departure** from]{.underline}
President Barack [Obama's policies.]{.underline} The Obama
administration had limited arms deals with Kiev to "defensive" and
non-combat related military items, such as trucks and medical supplies.

[A sale of Patriots would also be **immensely more expensive** than
buying Javelins]{.underline}, which could be a factor for cash-strapped
Ukraine. The purchase of more than 200 of the anti-tank missiles, along
with nearly 40 launchers and other equipment and services, was valued at
less than \$50 million in total, a fraction of what a single
surface-to-air missile system would set the country back, according to
its own ambassador to the United States.

**Rogin 17** - Trump administration approves lethal arms sales to
Ukraine, Washington Post, Proquest

The [Trump]{.underline} administration has [approved the largest U.S.
commercial sale of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine since
2014]{.underline}. The move was heavily supported by top Trump national
security Cabinet officials and Congress but may complicate President
Trump's stated ambition to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Administration officials confirmed that the State Department this month
approved a commercial license authorizing the export of Model M107A1
Sniper Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories to
Ukraine, a sale valued at \$41.5 million. These weapons address a
specific vulnerability of Ukrainian forces fighting a Russian-backed
separatist movement in two eastern provinces. There has been no approval
to export the heavier weapons the Ukrainian government is asking for,
such as Javelin antitank missiles. [Congress authorized such sales in
2014 in the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, but the Obama administration
never authorized large commercial or government sales, a move widely
seen as a de facto decision not to provide lethal weapons to the Ukraine
military]{.underline}. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob
Corker (R-Tenn.), who co-sponsored the law, praised the Trump
administration's move. "I'm pleased the administration approved the sale
of defensive lethal arms to Ukraine," Corker told me. "This decision was
supported by Congress in legislation that became law three years ago and
reflects our country's longstanding commitment to Ukraine in the face of
ongoing Russian aggression." A State Department spokesperson, speaking
on background, said that although the United States has now licensed the
commercial export of lethal weapons to Ukraine, the U.S. government has
not sold or given weapons directly to Ukraine. There's never been any
official policy on such sales one way or another, the spokesperson said,
adding that this license was granted on a case-by-case basis. There were
licenses granted for small commercial sales of small arms to Ukraine
before this year Another senior Trump administration official said that
Trump personally approved the decision to allow the issuing of the
license after being presented a decision memo by Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. While there was never a
formal ban on such weapons transfers, the decision was discussed
internally as a lifting of the de facto Obama administration
restrictions, the official said. As I reported in October, the decision
over whether to allow lethal arms sales to Ukraine had been sitting on
Trump's desk for months. The National Security Council's Principals
Committee, which includes Cabinet members, met months ago and provided
several options to the president. Experts and officials said
[Trump]{.underline}'s chosen option was measured; he didn't approve
everything the Ukrainians asked for but nonetheless [crossed the line of
approving lethal sales, a **significant shift**]{.underline} in his
administration's approach and U.S. policy overall. "[We have crossed the
Rubicon]{.underline}, [this is lethal weapons and I predict **more will
be coming**]{.underline}," said one senior congressional official. It's
likely no mere coincidence that Canada also approved lethal defense
sales to Ukraine this week, which would happen only if the Canadian
government knew the United States was on board, the official said.

WASHINGTON, Mar. 1, 2018 - [The State Department has made a
determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to Ukraine of
Javelin Missiles and Javelin Command Launch Un]{.underline}its (CLUs)
for an estimated cost of \$47 million. The Defense Security Cooperation
Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this
possible sale today. The Government of Ukraine has requested to buy two
hundred ten (210) Javelin Missiles and thirty-seven (37) Javelin Command
Launch Units (CLUs) (includes two (2) Javelin CLUs to be used as
spares). Also included are Basic Skill Trainers (BST); United States
Government and contractor technical assistance, transportation, training
and other related elements of logistics and program support. The total
estimated cost is not to exceed \$47 million. This proposed sale will
contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of Ukraine. The Javelin system will
help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its
sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to meet its national
defense requirements. Ukraine will have no difficulty absorbing this
system into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The
prime contractors will be Raytheon/Lockheed Martin Javelin Joint Venture
of Orlando, Florida and Tucson, Arizona. However, these missiles are
being provided from U.S. Army stocks and the CLUs will be obtained from
on-hand Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF)-purchased stocks. There
are no known offset agreements proposed in conjunction with this
potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S.
Government and/or contractor representatives to travel to Ukraine
temporarily in order to conduct training. There will be no adverse
impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. This
notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale
has been concluded. All questions regarding this proposed Foreign
Military Sale should be directed to the State Department\'s Bureau of
Political Military Affairs, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs,

United States: From Direct Commercial Sales to Lethal Security
Assistance

In a rare show of bipartisanship in 2014, the US [Congress]{.underline}
passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, which [appropriated \$350
million in]{.underline} security [assistance]{.underline}, including
anti-tank and anti-armor weapons, [to the government of
Ukraine]{.underline} to defend its territorial integrity. Despite strong
congressional backing, President Barack [Obama decided not to authorize
the US government sale or financing of lethal weapons to
Ukraine]{.underline}. [However, this policy did not prevent the private
export of US-made lethal weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}. [During the
Obama administration, **direct commercial sales** of]{.underline} small
[shipments of lethal arms to Ukraine were reviewed, approved, and
licensed]{.underline} on a case-by-case basis by the Department of State
in consultation with the Department of Defense. The US government
authorized nearly \$27 million of commercial defense articles and
services to Ukraine in 2016 and about \$68 million in 2015, portions of
which are classified as lethal weaponry. \*table omitted\* The 2016
Section 655 Report published by [the US Department of State, listing
approximately \$27 million in authorized commercial defense articles and
services to Ukraine]{.underline}. (Source: US Department of State) [It
is through this process that US-made lethal weapons arrived near
Ukraine's frontlines]{.underline}. According to a recent Digital
Forensic Research Lab investigation, the Texas-based company AirTronic
shipped 100 PSRL-1 (Precision Shoulder-Fired Rocket Launcher) systems to
the Ukrainian state-run Spetstechnoexport in April 2017. Some of these
rocket-propelled grenade launchers appeared during a training session of
the Azov Battalion, a regiment of fighters that has been integrated into
the National Guard, based near Mariupol in the summer of 2017. These
weapons were reportedly used only in training exercises and likely
returned to arms depots.

[The United States completed its shipment of Javelin anti-tank
missiles]{.underline} to Ukraine on Monday, [finalizing a sale that
was]{.underline} reluctantly [approved by]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} in November. The deal was widely reported as a
rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who annexed Crimea and
invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014. "This decision ... reflects our
country's longstanding commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing
Russian aggression," Republican Senator Bob Corker said late last year.
But the terms of the arrangement show it may be more bark than bite. The
weapons "have been delivered to a secure facility in Ukraine, not on the
line of conflict," Kurt Volker, the U.S. Special Representative for
Ukraine, told me. He did not elaborate further, but The Wall Street
Journal reported in January that the weapons would be stored in training
centers in western Ukraine that will be monitored by American soldiers.

Trump has said repeatedly that "no one is tougher on Russia" than him.
But his critics have accused him of challenging Putin only
superficially. Shortly after the Trump administration expelled 60
Russian diplomats in March---48 of whom were actually intelligence
officers, according to a State Department spokesperson---the State
Department acknowledged that the Kremlin would be allowed to refill the
vacated positions. The Treasury Department recently sanctioned more than
three dozen Russian oligarchs, officials, and entities who "profit" from
Russia's "malign activity" and "corrupt system." But many of the
sanctioned oligarchs had four months' notice to move their money, thanks
to a list of Russia's wealthiest individuals released by the Treasury in
January. That money might already be back in Russia. "As they say, 'a
barking dog cannot hinder a caravan's journey,'" Putin told Russia's
TASS news agency at the time. He mocked his own absence from the list.
When UN Ambassador Nikki Haley announced new sanctions against Russia
over its support for embattled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, she was
contradicted by the White House hours later. "There is confusion about
the Putin-Trump relationship," Major General Volodymyr Havrylov,
Ukraine's defense attaché to the U.S., told me last month. "And an
element of unpredictability. But we believe in checks and balances in
the United States." Former National-Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed for Trump to approve the lethal
weapons sale to Ukraine, according to Havyrlov and another U.S. official
familiar with the deal who requested anonymity to discuss it freely.
Trump was convinced, at least in part, by the fact that President Barack
Obama---to whom Trump frequently compares himself---had balked at the
sale. The official relayed a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian
President Petro Poroshenko last year in which Trump asked why Obama had
"done nothing when Russia invaded Crimea." (Obama sanctioned Russia over
the incursion in 2014.) [Trump, ever transactional, also wanted to make
sure he was **not giving away something for nothing**]{.underline}. [The
U.S. official said it was emphasized to the president that this would be
a sale, not a gift]{.underline}, and Poroshenko won favor with Trump by
facilitating an \$80 million coal deal---the first between the U.S. and
Ukraine---that was politically expedient for both leaders. In February,
Ukrainian Railways signed a \$1 billion locomotive deal with GE
Transportation. Trump had promised during the campaign to revitalize the
U.S. rail industry. "The Trump administration is very much focused on
jobs creation," said Daniel Vajdich, the president of the strategic
advisory firm Yorktown Solutions. "So, naturally, Ukraine has thought
about its ability to help create jobs for Americans in the context of
creating leverage by feeding into Trump's policy desires." A
Ukrainian-American lobbyist who spoke to me on condition of anonymity
put it more bluntly: "Poroshenko has become a hostage of Trump," he told
me.
