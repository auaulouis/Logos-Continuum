#### Interpretation---The affirmative must make a permanent and unconditional reduction

#### Reduction means permanent decrease not suspend

**Reynolds 59,** Walter Reynolds in New York Appellate Court Judge,
Writing court opinion In the Matter of Doris A. Montesani, Petitioner,
v. Arthur Levitt, as Comptroller of The State of New York, et al.,
Respondents Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, Third Department. August 13, 1959.
https://www.leagle.com/decision/1959609ad2d51143

Under his retirement contract deceased agreed that in return for a plan
that would insure payment of the remainder of his initial fund to his
beneficiary after his death he would accept a lower rate of lifetime
compensation. Implicit in this agreement were various statutory
provisions governing the rights of both parties. One of these provisions
was section 83 which provided that if deceased were able to return to a
gainful occupation or actually did so his pension would accordingly be
reduced. This reduction would be governed by the amount he actually
earned or was capable of earning. We now reach one of the major issues
in the case, to wit: Is section 83 to be considered as a binding factor
in his contract and if so [does \"reduce\" mean \"forfeit\" or
\"temporarily suspended]{.underline}\"? It seems obvious that section 83
was in the law to protect the System against disability retirees who
might, in truth, be capable of providing for themselves without being on
dole (albeit a \"contractural\" dole). See Matter of Stewart v. O\'Dwyer
(271 App. Div. 485, 490 \[1st Dept., 1946\]), where such a purpose is
ascribed to section 83\'s counterpart in the New York City retirement
statute. Deceased quit his work here because of his physical defect and
elected the plan of retirement he fancied most suitable. He impliedly
agreed to all the terms of the contract which included section 83. When
he became employed in California at a considerable salary section 83
came into play and cut off his monthly pension payments although his
annuity payments were not affected (thus he was not being deprived of
anything he had contributed). There is no persuasive \[9 A.D.2d 56\]
argument that this was not proper. When the California employment
ceased, assuming deceased to be still living, should he then be entitled
to the withheld payments? Section 83\'s counterpart with regard to
nondisability pensioners, section 84, prescribes a reduction only if the
pensioner should again take a public job. The disability pensioner is
penalized if he takes any type of employment. The reason for the
difference, of course, is that in one case the only reason pension
benefits are available is because the pensioner is considered incapable
of gainful employment, while in the other he has fully completed his
\"tour\" and is considered as having earned his reward with almost no
strings attached. It would be manifestly unfair to the ordinary retiree
to accord the disability retiree the benefits of the System to which
they both belong when the latter is otherwise capable of earning a
living and had not fulfilled his service obligation. If it were to be
held that withholdings under section 83 were payable whenever the
pensioner died or stopped his other employment the whole purpose of the
provision would be defeated, i.e., the System might just as well have
continued payments during the other employment since it must later pay
it anyway. The section says \"reduced\", does not say that monthly
payments shall be temporarily suspended; it says that the pension itself
shall be reduced. [The plain]{.underline} dictionary [meaning of the
word is to diminish, lower or degrade. The word \"reduce\" seems
adequately to indicate **permanency.**]{.underline} Aside from the
practical aspect indicating permanency other indicia point to the same
conclusion. From 1924 (L. 1924, ch. 619) to 1947 (L. 1947, ch. 841) a
provision appeared in the Civil Service Law which read substantially as
follows: \"If the pension of a beneficiary is reduced for any reason,
the amount of such reduction shall be transferred from the pension
reserve fund to the pension accumulation fund during that period that
such reduction is in effect.\" (See L. 1924, ch. 619, § 2 \[Civil
Service Law, § 58, subd. 4\]; L. 1947, ch. 841 \[Civil Service Law, §
66, subd. e\].) This provision reappears in the 1955 Retirement and
Social Security Law as subdivision f of section 24. This provision is
useful for interpretative purposes. Since it prescribes that moneys not
paid because of reduction should be transferred back to the accumulation
fund the conclusion is inescapable that such reductions were meant to be
permanent. If temporary suspensions were intended this bookkeeping
device would result in a false picture of the funds, i.e., the reserve
fund would be depleted when it would contain adequate funds to meet
eventual payments \[9 A.D.2d 57\] to present pensioners. Likewise, the
accumulation fund would be improperly inflated with respect to the
present pensioners. Section 64 of the Retirement and Social Security Law
(§ 85 under the 1947 act) provides that any disability pension must be
reduced by the amount payable pursuant to the Workmen\'s Compensation
Law if applicable. In Matter of Dalton v. City of Yonkers (262 App. Div.
321, 323 \[1941\]) this court interpreted \"reduce\" to mean \"offset\"
in holding that under then section 67 (relating to Workmen\'s
Compensation benefits as do its successors sections 85 and 64), pensions
were to be offset by compensation benefits. This is merely another
indication that \"[reduce\" means a diminishing]{.underline} of the
pension pursuant to a given formula [rather than a]{.underline} mere
[recoverable, temporary suspension]{.underline} during the time other
benefits or salaries are being received by the pensioner. (Also, cf.,
Retirement and Social Security Law, § 101 \[§ 84 under the 1947 act\].)

#### The affirmative violates---They condition arm sales on changes in policy in another country. This is a suspension of arm sales conditioned on good behavior.

#### Topicality is a voting issue for limits and ground---Their interpretation steals the condition counterplan from the negative, allows the affirmative to make reductions temporary, and unlimits because there are an unlimited number of conditions you could place on a suspension.

In answering this question, the Hampton court turned to various
principles for guidance. The court looked first to the \"plain meaning\"
of the statute.6 \" Interpretation of a statute involves ascertaining
the legislative intent behind the enactment of the statute.
[Consideration of the \"plain meaning\" of the words used]{.underline}
in the statute [is a basic principle of]{.underline} statutory
construction in [determining legislative intent]{.underline}.6 7
[The]{.underline} Hampton [court discussed]{.underline} [the \"plain
meaning\" of]{.underline} the words \"[reduce]{.underline}\" and
\"claim\" in reaching its construction of the statute. The court
referred to the dictionary definition of \"reduce\" [as meaning \"to
diminish in size, amount, extent or number]{.underline};
[to]{.underline} make small or to lower, [bring down]{.underline} or to
change the denomination of [a quantity]{.underline}.\" 68 The court then
judicially defined \"claim\" as \"the amount of damages as determined by
an impartial fact finder - the jury.\"\'

#### The affirmative violates---The plan merely identifies a country to which the U.S. can't make certain sales---It does not mandate a reduction of total sales

#### Our interpretation is better

#### They make topicality probabilistic---Since they only limit sales to a specific geographic space they do not mandate a reduction in U.S. arm sales because those same weapons can be sold to any other country offsetting any reduction. The plan does not mandate a reduction in total arm sales---it only says you can't sell them in a specific geographic location. 

#### Our interpretation ensures better limits---The U.S. sells arms to 98 different countries massively expanding the topic and requiring the negative to have country specific disads for the entire world.

#### They are grammatically incorrect.\-- "of arms from the United States" is a prepositional phrase that identifies which FMS and DCS are effected by the plan. The reduction must apply to the entire set of arms sold from the U.S. \-- "Arms" is a mass noun

Mass nouns only have one form: e.g. furniture, clothes. So you can't say
1 furniture, 2 furnitures, 3 furnitures etc. This is why mass nouns are
also called uncountable nouns. **[Mass nouns cannot be used with
a/an]{.underline}**. WRONG: a furniture Mass nouns are fixed as singular
or plural. RIGHT: furniture, clothes WRONG: furnitures, a clothe
However, it may be possible to use "a piece of / an item of" for
singular and "some" for plural. RIGHT: a piece of furniture, some
furniture / an item of clothing, some clothes You can use e.g. the
furniture for both singular and plural references. **[Unit nouns usually
refer to one or many separate items or units]{.underline}**. E.g. a
chair/chairs, an office/offices, a client/clients, etc. **[Mass nouns
usually refer to: ideas, concepts]{.underline}** (e.g. approval,
employment) substances (e.g. meat, metal) liquids (e.g. water, beer)
powders (e.g. dust, sugar) Some words may be either a unit noun or a
mass noun, e.g. chicken Unit: My parents keep chickens. (birds) Mass: I
don't usually eat chicken. (meat) Compare: "I found a piece of chicken
in my soup." (mass = a piece of meat) "I found a piece of a chicken in
my soup." (unit = a piece of a bird) There are 4 **[types of mass
nouns:]{.underline}** Singular nouns that are always mass nouns
**[Plural nouns that are always mass nouns]{.underline}** Nouns that can
be unit nouns or mass nouns and have the same meaning Nouns that can be
unit nouns or mass nouns but have different meanings 1. Singular nouns
that are always mass nouns These nouns have no plural form. Examples:
furniture equipment advice information In many languages information is
a unit noun, and has both singular and plural forms. This is NOT the
case in English. As a result mistakes with information are very common.
WRONG: The informations that you sent us in your last email are out of
date. RIGHT: The information that you sent us in your last email is out
of date. 2. **[Plural nouns that are always mass nouns]{.underline}**
These nouns **[have no singular form.]{.underline}** They take the
plural verb form ("are", not "is") except for "news" which takes "is".
**[Examples:]{.underline}** clothes trousers scissors thanks news
customs **[arms (i.e. weapons)]{.underline}** remains.

#### Mass nouns require treating the noun as a whole without reference to specific parts

Bunt (1985. pp. 45-46) goes on to claim that \"[[mass nouns provide the
possibility of talking about things as if they do not consist of
discrete parts]{.underline}]{.mark}\" and that \"a linguistic semantic
theory should take into account that the use of [[a mass noun is a way
of talking about things as if they were homogeneous masses.
i.e]{.underline}..]{.mark} as having some part-whole structure but
[[without singling out any particular parts]{.underline}]{.mark} and
without any commitments concerning the existence of minimal parts.\" He
calls this the homogeneous reference hypothesis and restatcs it as
follows: \"[Mass nouns refer to entities as having a part-whole
structure without singling out any particular parts]{.underline} and
without making any commitments concerning the existence of minimal
parts\" (Bunt 1985. p. 46: see also Bunt 1979. pp. 255-256).

20\. Chapter 1 Nouns 1.0 Introduction Nouns are the most numerous word
class in English, but individually they tend not to be as frequent as
the grammatical (or 'function') word classes, such as prepositions and
determiners. The most common nouns, time and people, are the 76th and
80th most frequent words in English, according to one frequency list
(and that is without discounting their occasional use as verbs).
**[Nouns have a number of interesting features]{.underline}** which are
not dealt with here: the distinction between singular and plural
(sometimes formed irregularly), the (Saxon) genitive and their formation
with certain derivational endings (such as -tion or -ment). A number of
important factors are focussed on in the activities below. By far **[the
most important is whether the noun is 'count' or
'noncount']{.underline}**. Thus, **[certain nouns can be 'counted'
grammatically in the sense that they can be preceded by
a/an]{.underline}** or one, two or any other numeral. A typical count
noun would be car: a car, two cars. **[Noncount nouns cannot be
'counted']{.underline}**. For example, advice: you cannot say \*an
advice or \*two advices (though you can use a counting expression: two
pieces of advice; here piece is the count noun). Many nouns can be both
count and noncount, often with little change in meaning (other than
referring to a mass of something or an individual item), e.g. string/a
string, divorce/a divorce. In other cases we regard one form as the
basic and the other as derived from it by a process of 'conversion',
with a predictable difference in meaning. Thus, a dog (count) can become
dog (noncount) to refer to the meat. This process is systematic since it
applies to other animals and their meat. However, in many cases the
difference between the count and noncount meanings, though there is a
relationship, is neither predictable nor systematic. A good example is
room. As a count noun it refers to a unit of a building; as a noncount
noun it means 'space'. They could almost be treated as different lexical
items. **[The choice of determiners is]{.underline}** also **[influenced
by the count status of a noun]{.underline}**. Thus, much is restricted
to noncount nouns and many to count (plural) nouns. Little and few are
similarly constrained. The, unlike a/an, can be used with both types of
noun, however, as can this and that. Some is usually used with noncount
nouns to refer to a vague quantity (some money) and count nouns in the
plural to refer to a vague number (some people), but it can also be used
with count singular nouns to indicate something or someone unknown: Some
student was looking for you. Another feature of nouns is that some only
occur in the plural form. Trousers and binoculars are good examples; we
cannot say \*a trouser/binocular. These are sometimes called
www.ebook3000.com 21. 8 Nouns plural nouns. However, in many such cases,
there is a singular form but with a very different meaning, which may in
turn have its own plural. **[Thus arms can either be a distinct plural
noun meaning 'weapons', or the plural of arm, meaning 'limbs'. This
factor may combine with the count status of a noun.]{.underline}** Thus,
glass can either be a noncount noun referring to the substance, or a
count noun referring to the item we drink from. (The relationship is not
predictable because a glass does not refer to anything made of glass,
such as a window; indeed, a 'glass' may be made of plastic.) However,
glasses can either be the plural of a glass or a distinct plural noun
meaning 'spectacles'. A third factor focussed on below is the sub-class
of 'collective nouns'. Certain singular count nouns can take a plural
verb form (if they are the subject) when they are regarded as referring
to a group of individuals. For example: The government have decided...
The alternative with a singular verb form is possible, if the
speaker/writer wishes to convey the idea a single body: The government
has decided... With such nouns a plural form is possible of course: The
governments have agreed... A final feature of nouns, very different from
the different sub-classes identified above, is their function in noun
phrases. Nouns are typically thought of as the head of noun phrases; for
example, a profitable business. But very often they function as a
premodifier, in front of a head noun: a business student. In this case
the distinction between count and noncount will not be formally marked
by an accompanying determiner, for example; however, the meaning is
usually the noncount one. This will be relevant in some of the exercises
below. The noun sselected below are not necessarily the most frequent,
but they are representative of the important factors outlined above.
1.1wood As explained above in 1.0, many nouns can be both count and
noncount with a difference in meaning. Sometimes this difference is
predictable, but sometimes it is not; in these cases the count and
noncount versions of such words seem to refer to separate lexical ideas.
This is certainly the case with wood. As a count noun it refers to a
collection of trees, smaller than a forest; for example: We camped in a
small wood at the side of the road. As a noncount noun it means the
material obtained from trees used for building, for making fires, etc.:
Different types of wood burn differently. Activity 1.1 Look at these
lines and decide whether wood is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun. 22.
Nouns  9   Hints: • Look at the determiner used with wood. If there is
no determiner, it is noncount (assuming of course that it is the head of
the noun phrase); if there is a, then it is count. • Work out the
meaning; if wood refers to the material then it is noncount, if it is a
place consisting of trees then count. 1. ...it's finished in an
attractive shade that enhances the natural grain of the wood. 2. \[It\]
consisted of rough grazing, perhaps within a wood. 3. So, I used the
ship's sails, rope, and pieces of wood, and after a lot of hard work I
had a very fine tent. 4. ...he's imagining the fox walking through the
wood and coming towards his window. 5. Our house is made of wood and is
dark green. 6. Only wych elm grew in the wood and it burned for me quite
well when dry. 7. And is it not the best wood for coffins? 8. Many
town-dwellers burn wood for pleasure. 9. Once one gets the taste for
smoking wood it is possible to mix and obtain subtle flavours... 10.
Regular visitors include two wood pigeons, seven collar doves,
innumerable rooks and jackdaws. 1.2 promise Promise is another of the
nouns discussed in 1.0 that are both count and noncount, but where the
two meanings are quite different. As a count noun it means something
that you say as a guarantee of future action: He's broken his promise
again. whereas as a noncount noun it means 'potential': She has lots of
promise. The adjective promising is related to this meaning, whereas the
verb promise usually refers to the count meaning. Activity 1.2 Look at
the lines below and decide whether promise is a: a. count noun b.
noncount noun. (Note: over half the occurrences of promise are the verb;
these are not included.) Hint: try to pluralise promise (making other
necessary changes). If this is possible without changing the meaning
then it is a count noun. 23. 10 Nouns 1. ...progress on the trunk road
is now a firm promise... 2. She is already a lacemaker of great
promise... 3. This new venture seems to hold great promise for the
future... 4. And, in the end, if much of the promise is still
unfulfilled, in his own words, 'I ain't done too bad'. 5. She recalled a
promise made by Mr Major when he became Prime Minister... 6. ...an
environment unnaturally charged with emotion and hooked on an expensive
promise of love and everlasting life. 7. The Society also gained some
interesting new facts regarding the BCR, together with the promise of
some more photographic material. 8. Notwithstanding this promise, the
use of road pricing to change travel habits still seems some way off. 9.
But Mr Clarke's statements since the meeting give the impression that he
reneged on his promise to us. 10. ...\[they\] died young, their promise
unfulfilled, like everyone from Jimmy Blanton to Charlie Parker. 1.3
business Business is another noun that changes meaning according to
whether it is count or noncount, without a predictable relationship
between the two meanings. As a count noun it indicates a company or a
particular activity; as a noncount noun, it refers to trade and
commercial activity, or activity in general. He's been running his own
business since he was 17. (count) This outbreak is a terrible business.
(count) I've got no head for business. (noncount) It is commonly used as
a premodifier in a noun phrase: We offer a comprehensive range of
services for the business traveller. Activity 1.3 Work out on these
lines whether business is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun. (There is
also one line where it is a premodifier.) Hint: try to pluralise
business (making other necessary changes). If this is possible without
changing the meaning then it is a count noun. 1. Scotch Whisky is a core
business for all of them. 2. Winning The Queen's Awards brings prestige,
credibility and increased business. 3. \[It\] has been an international
business for over 230 years. 4. The safest way to ensure that you are
getting the best practical business advice for your money is... 5. And
multi-player games are good for business. 24. Nouns  11   6. ...all the
important legal developments likely to affect your business... 7.
...\[he\] reckons that business is now becoming so complex that he needs
a new core of trained administrators. 8. His romantic northern-sounding
address...helped his business more than a little. 9. ...MPs are now
thrashing through the business of submitting themselves to their local
parties. 10. This is forcing people to equip themselves with computers
in a hurry. This is not an easy business. 1.4 work Work is another noun
which can be both count and noncount, with largely unrelated meanings.
As a noncount noun it refers to formal activity or employment: I've got
work to do. What time do you finish work today? (In this meaning one
equivalent count noun is job.) It can also be the place where people are
employed: She's not at work today. When it is count it generally refers
to a work of art. It is also common as a verb. Activity 1.4 Work out on
these lines whether work is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun. (There is
also one line where it is a premodifier.) Hint: sometimes a verb can
indicate the count status of a following noun. You do or carry out work,
but you create a work. 1. It also fits in with work being carried out at
other research centres. 2. ...a biblical text was used to create another
well-known work by the son... 3. Since we offer training as part of our
technical support contract, this work can easily be done by any office
worker. 4. All participants are work colleagues. 5. Without their
efforts this vital work could not be done. 6. In this second edition the
standard work has been fully revised with a number of new photographs.
7. In return she will do research or voluntary work. 8. If the outdoor
work is not for you, there are many ways in which you can still help. 9.
\[The artists\] are also displaying some of their work. 10. The Trust's
annual cycle rides have always proved popular and successful in raising
funds for our work. 25. 12 Nouns 1.5 play As a count noun play usually
refers to the works of a playwright: the plays of Shakespeare (and for
which the closest noncount equivalent is drama). As a noncount noun it
refers to sporting or entertaining activity (Play is good for children),
where it is closely related in meaning to the verb play. Activity 1.5
Work out whether play on these lines is: a. count b. noncount. Hint:
work out the meaning. 1. I am reminded of a line in Tony Kushner's play
Angels in America... 2. But this emphasis is rather distorting for the
play as a whole... 3. The six championship courts (five glass-backed)
provide ideal conditions for play... 4. Henry V offers, better than any
other play in the repertoire, what might be called a yuppie dynamic...
5. Science lends itself to learning through play. 6. Each play is
treated separately in its own section and no comparison among them is
made. 7. ...we are simply presented with certain aspects of the play's
style and development. 8. Cancellations notified to Reception before the
day of play will not be charged. 1.6 space As a count noun space refers
to a specific empty area: I couldn't find a parking space. In this it is
related in meaning to the noncount use, referring to a non-specific
area: It's a waste of space. However, there is another unrelated
noncount meaning where it refers to the universe outside the planet
Earth: Space: the final frontier... Activity 1.6 Decide whether space on
the following lines is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun referring to
the universe c. noncount noun referring to an indefinite empty area. 26.

#### A mass noun requires the entire set---the use of the word "the" before executive power indicates it means all

SPECIFICITY IN RUNYANKORE-RUKIGA
<file:///C:/Users/sharris/Downloads/asiimwe_definiteness_2014.pdf>

Lyons (1999: 11) points out that plural and [[mass nouns involve]{.mark}
the [inclusivenes]{.mark}s hypothesis]{.underline}. Therefore,
'[[reference is to the **totality** of the objects]{.underline}]{.mark}
or mass [[in the context which satisfies the description']{.mark}.
[With]{.mark}]{.underline} plural and **[[mass
nouns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Lyons suggests that [[the definite **the**
is a **universal quantifier just like all**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see
also Hawkins, 1978). In short, Lyons holds the view that the key
principles to definiteness understanding are identifiability and
inclusiveness, and that a referent may be definite due to either of the
two or both principles.

#### Mass Nouns mean the whole collective

[[Mass nouns can **only** refer to things as a **collective, without
particularizing** the elements they consist of]{.mark},]{.underline}

countable and noncountable senses and are therefore dual in this respect

**Nordquist 18** Richard Nordquist, Ph.D., is professor emeritus of
rhetoric and English at Armstrong State University Updated April 20,
2018, Why Does Grammar Matter?,
<https://www.thoughtco.com/why-does-grammar-matter-1691029>

One of the most sensible answers to the question of why grammar matters
appears in a position statement on the teaching of grammar in American
schools. Published by the National Council of Teachers of English
(NCTE), the report is refreshingly free of educational cant. Here\'s how
it begins: [Grammar is important because it is the language that makes
it possible for us to talk about language]{.underline}. Grammar names
the types of words and word groups that make up sentences not only in
English but in any language. As human beings, we can put sentences
together even as children---we can all do grammar. But to be able to
talk about how sentences are built, about the types of words and word
groups that make up sentences---that is knowing about grammar. And
[[knowing about grammar offers a window into the human
mind]{.mark}]{.underline} and into our amazingly complex mental
capacity. People associate grammar with errors and correctness. But
knowing about grammar also helps us understand what makes sentences and
paragraphs clear and interesting and precise. Grammar can be part of
literature discussions, when we and our students closely read the
sentences in poetry and stories. And knowing about grammar means finding
out that all languages and all dialects follow grammatical patterns.
(Brock Haussamen, \"Guideline on Some Questions and Answers About
Grammar\", 2002) The author of this introduction, Brock Haussamen, is
professor emeritus of English at Raritan Valley Community College of New
Jersey. Whether or not you teach English for a living, the full report,
\"Guideline on Some Questions and Answers About Grammar,\" is well worth
the read for anyone interested in English grammar.\* Additional
Perspectives on Grammar Consider these explanations of why grammar
matters from other experts in English and education: \"On the utility
and importance of the study of Grammar, and the principles of
composition, much might be advanced, for the encouragement of persons in
early life to apply themselves to this branch of learning\... It may
indeed be justly asserted, that many of the differences in opinion
amongst men, with the disputes, contentions, and alienations of heart,
which have too often proceeded from such differences, have been
occasioned by a want of proper skill in the connexion and meaning of
words, and by a tenacious misapplication of language.\" (Lindley Murray,
English Grammar, Adapted to the Different Classes of Learners, 1818)
\"We study grammar because a knowledge of sentence structure is an aid
in the interpretation of literature; because continual dealing with
sentences influences the student to form better sentences in his own
composition; and because [[grammar is the best subject in our course of
study for the development of reasoning power]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"
(William Frank Webster, The Teaching of English Grammar. Houghton, 1905)
\"The study of language is a part of general knowledge. We study the
complex working of the human body to understand ourselves; the same
reason should attract us to studying the marvelous complexity of human
language\... \"[[If you understand the nature of language, you will
realize the ground for your linguistic prejudices and perhaps moderate
them; you will also more clearly assess linguistic issues of public
concern, such]{.underline}]{.mark} as worries about the state of the
language or [[what to do about the teaching of
immigrants]{.underline}]{.mark}. Studying the English language has a
more obvious practical application: it can help you to use the language
more effectively.\" (Sidney Greenbaum and Gerald Nelson, An Introduction
to English Grammar, 2nd ed. Longman, 2002) \"Grammar is the study of how
sentences mean. And that is why it helps. If we want to understand the
meaning conveyed by sentences, and to develop our ability to express and
respond to this meaning, then [[the more we know about grammar, the
better we will be able to carry out these tasks\... \"Grammar is the
structural foundation of our ability to express
ourselves]{.underline}]{.mark}. The more we are aware of how it works,
the more we can monitor the meaning and effectiveness of the way we and
others use language. It can help foster precision, detect ambiguity, and
exploit the richness of expression available in English. And [[it can
help everyone]{.underline}]{.mark}---not only teachers of English, but
teachers of anything, [[for all teaching is ultimately a matter of
getting to grips with meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" (David Crystal,
Making Sense of Grammar. Longman, 2004)

#### The U.S. can increase sales to other countries to offset any reduction in the plan---There is large room for growth in the arms market---

#### They can increase sales to Europe

**Shalal 19** ANDREA SHALAL Reporter for U.S. News and World Report U.S.
Foreign Arms Sales Hit \$44.15 Billion in First Three Quarters of FY2019
June 19, 2019, U.S. Foreign Arms Sales Hit \$44.15 Billion in First
Three Quarters of FY2019,
https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2019-06-19/us-foreign-arms-sales-hit-4415-billion-in-first-three-quarters-of-fy2019

The Pentagon\'s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has executed
\$44.15 billion in U.S. foreign arms sales through June 19, and the
agency\'s director said he was optimistic the total for the full year
would reach last year\'s \$55.66 billion. DSCA Director U.S. Army
Lieutenant General Charles Hooper told business executives and reporters
[the U.S. government was continuing its concerted drive to step up arms
sales to improve the capabilities of allies]{.underline} and accelerate
the process. \"I think things are going well, and remember, we still
have a quarter left to go,\" he said at the Paris Airshow, where more
than 400 U.S. companies are exhibiting their aerospace and defense
equipment. [Fiscal 2018 arms sales rose 33 percent above the year
earlier]{.underline} level, and could rise further in the current fiscal
year. Hooper told Reuters after his speech that he could not predict the
full year level for fiscal 2019, but said he was optimistic last year\'s
total would be reached again. \"I look at this total. I think we\'ve
come a long way. I\'m always optimistic,\" he said. Hooper said a move
by DSCA to reduce the administrative surcharge on foreign arms sales
from 3.5 percent to 3.2 percent had already saved its customers \$180
million. The U.S. government was also working to speed deliveries to
countries that purchased U.S. weapons, Hooper said. For instance, he
said one country that had ordered the Raytheon Co Patriot missile
defense system would receive initial equipment in just two years, far
more quickly than in the past. He said foreign military sales to the
European area accounted for over \$13.11 billion of total arms sales
executed in fiscal 2018. Industry executives at the Paris Airshow say
[demand for weapons in Europe is increasing]{.underline}, in part [due
to increased threats from Russia, as well as pressure from the United
States on European allies to spending on their own
security]{.underline}.

#### There are vast new markets in Europe

**Cloughley 18** Brian Cloughley British and Australian armies' veteran,
former deputy head of the UN military mission in Kashmir and Australian
defense attaché in Pakistan, NATO Is a Goldmine for US Weapons'
Industries,
<https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2018/07/30/nato-is-goldmine-for-us-weapons-industries/>

[Countries of]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} military alliance
[have been ordered by]{.underline} President [Trump to increase their
spending on weapons]{.underline}, and the reasons for his insistence
they do so are becoming clearer. It's got nothing to do with any defence
rationale, because, after all, the Secretary General of the US-NATO
military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, has admitted that "we don't see any
imminent threat against any NATO ally" and the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute recorded in its 2018 World Report that "at
\$66.3 billion, Russia's military spending in 2017 was 20 per cent lower
than in 2016." Even Radio Free Europe, the US government\'s anti-Russia
broadcaster, records that Russia has reduced its defence spending. There
is demonstrably no threat whatever to any NATO country by Russia, but
this is considered irrelevant in the context of US arms' sales, which
are flourishing and being encouraged to increase and multiply. On July
12, the second and final day of the recent US-NATO meeting, Reuters
reported Trump as saying that "the United States makes by far the best
military equipment in the world: the best jets, the best missiles, the
best guns, the best everything." He went on "to list the top US arms
makers, Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp by
name." On July 11 the Nasdaq Stock Exchange listed the stock price of
Lockheed Martin at \$305.68. The day after Trump's speech, it increased
to \$318.37. On July 11 the Nasdaq Stock Exchange listed the stock price
of Boeing at \$340.50. The day after Trump's speech, it increased to
\$350.79. On July 11 the New York Stock Exchange listed the stock price
of Northrop Grumman (it doesn't appear on Nasdaq) at \$311.71. The day
after Trump's speech, it increased to \$321.73. General Dynamics,
another major US weapons producer, might not be too pleased, however,
because its stock price rose only slightly, from \$191.51 to \$192.74.
Nor might Raytheon, the maker of the Patriot missile system which
Washington is selling all over the world, because its stock went up by a
modest five dollars, from \$194.03 to \$199.75. Perhaps they will be
named by Trump the next time he makes a speech telling his country's
bemused allies to buy US weapons. Trump also declared that "We have many
wealthy countries with us today \[July 12 at the NATO Conference\] but
we have some that aren't so wealthy and they did ask me if they could
buy the military equipment, and could I help them out, and we will help
them out a little bit," which made it clear that poorer countries that
want to buy American weapons will probably not have to put cash down for
their purchases. So it wasn't altogether surprising that the stock
prices of the three arms manufacturers named by Trump all rose by over
ten dollars. To further boost this bonanza, the State Department did its
best to make US arms sales even easier by enabling weapons manufacturers
to avoid the well-constructed checks and balances that had been in place
to ensure that at least a few legal, moral and economic constraints
would be observed when various disreputable regimes queued up to buy
American weapons. But these regulations no longer apply, because on July
13 the State Department announced new measures to "fast-track government
approval of proposals from defense and aerospace companies" which action
was warmly welcomed by the President of the US Chamber of Commerce
Defence and Aerospace Export Council, Keith Webster, who is "looking
forward to continued collaboration with the White House on initiatives
that further expand international opportunities for the defense and
aerospace industries." There was yet more boosting by Lt-General Charles
Hooper, Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, who
declared at the Farnborough International Air Show on July 18 that
"Defense exports are good for our national security, they're good for
our foreign policy. And they're good for our economic security." He then
proposed that his agency cut the transportation fee charged to foreign
military sales clients, which would be a major stimulant for sales of
"the best jets, the best missiles, the best guns" so valued by Mr Trump.
Obviously a devoted follower of his President, the General followed the
Trump line with dedication by reminding the media that "as the
administration and our leadership has said, economic security is
national security." This man just might go places in Trump World. But he
won't go as far as the arms manufacturers, whose future growth and
profits are assured under Trump and the Washington Deep State, which is
defined as "military, intelligence and government officials who try to
secretly manipulate government policy." US weapons producers have
realised, as said so presciently two thousand years ago by the Roman
statesman, Cicero, that "the sinews of war are infinite money," and
their contentment will continue to grow in synchrony with their
financial dividends. Voice of America joined the chorus of reportage on
July 12 and observed that "with Thursday\'s renewed pledge by NATO
countries to meet defense spending goals, some of the biggest
beneficiaries could be US weapons manufacturers, which annually already
export billions of dollars worth of arms across the globe." Within
European NATO, [the biggest spenders on US arms, thus far, are Poland,
Romania, Britain and Greece, and the amounts involved are
colossal]{.underline}. Poland, whose economy is booming, has signed an
agreement to buy Patriot missile systems for \$4.75 billion, adding to
the purchase of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles for \$200
million, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, costing \$250
million, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems for the same amount.
Delivery of its 48 F-16 multi-role strike aircraft (\$4.7 billion) began
in 2006, and Warsaw has proved a loyal customer ever since. Who knows
what exotic new piece of US hardware will be ordered as a result of Mr
Trump's encouragement? Romania, a country with only 750 kilometres of
motorway (tiny Belgium has 1,700 km), has been seeking World Bank
assistance for its road projects but is unlikely to benefit because it
is so gravely corrupt. This has not stopped it purchasing US artillery
rocket systems for \$1.25 billion and Patriot missiles for a colossal
\$3.9 billion, following-on from construction in May 2016 of a US Aegis
missile station, at Washington's expense. It forms part of the US-NATO
encirclement of Russia, and its missiles are to be operational this
year. [The message for European NATO is that the US is pulling out all
stops to sell weapons]{.underline}, and that although, for example,
"about 84% of the UK\'s total arms imports come from the United States",
there is room for improvement. Slovakia is buying \$150 millions' worth
of helicopters and paying a satisfying \$2.91 billion for F-16 fighters,
but other NATO countries appear to have been less disposed to purchase
more of "the best jets, the best missiles, the best guns" that Mr Trump
has on offer. [The mine of NATO gold is there for
exploitation]{.underline}, and following Trump's enthusiastic
encouragement of his arms' manufacturers it seems that extraction will
be effective. [The US Military-Industrial Complex stands to gain
handsomely from its President's campaign to boost the quantities of
weapons in the world]{.underline}.

President [Trump already has boosted arms sales to unprecedented
levels]{.underline}. The United States had 34 percent of the global arms
trade in 2017, an increase of 25 percent over the previous five years.
Russia's share fell 7 percent during that period. The Middle East buys
almost half of total U.S. arms exports, [showing there is room for
growth in exports to India. And, acquiring more weapons from the United
States would make strategic sense for India]{.underline}, since its most
dangerous rival, China, is unlikely to get the same technology.

well. [You can add]{.underline} former U.S. enemy [Vietnam to the list
of new customers for expensive U.S. weapons systems]{.underline}, after
President Obama last month visited the Southeast Asian country and
opened the door to expanded military sales to its government in an
effort to counteract China\'s increased saber rattling in the region.
The usual suspects to profit from sustained defense spending include
Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and
Raytheon. They all benefit from the perpetual global arms race. But
they\'re behemoths with only so much room for growth, and the
industry\'s tailwinds are already built into their stock prices.

In answering this question, the Hampton court turned to various
principles for guidance. The court looked first to the \"plain meaning\"
of the statute.6 \" Interpretation of a statute involves ascertaining
the legislative intent behind the enactment of the statute.
[Consideration of the \"plain meaning\" of the words used]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Hampton [court discussed]{.underline} [the \"plain

\"claim\" in reaching its construction of the statute. The court
referred to the dictionary definition of \"reduce\" [as meaning \"to
diminish in size, amount, extent or number]{.underline};
[to]{.underline} make small or to lower, [bring down]{.underline} or to
change the denomination of [a quantity]{.underline}.\" 68 The court then
judicially defined \"claim\" as \"the amount of damages as determined by
an impartial fact finder - the jury.\"\'

#### The affirmative violates---The plan merely identifies a specific weapon which the U.S. can't sell---It does not mandate a reduction of total sales.

#### Our interpretation is better

#### They make topicality probabilistic---Since they only limit sales of a specific weapon they do not mandate a reduction in U.S. arm sales because they do not prevent the U.S. from increasing sales of other weapons to offset the loss in revenue. The plan does not mandate a reduction in total arm sales---it only says you can't sell a specific weapon. 

#### Our interpretation ensures better limits---The U.S. sells hundreds of different types of weapons. Allowing the aff to limit a specific weapon system adds hundreds of affirmatives to the topic.

#### They destroy negative ground---They can spike out of economy or defense industry disads by saying they would sell other weapons.

#### They are grammatically incorrect.\-- "of arms from the United States" is a prepositional phrase that identifies which FMS and DCS are effected by the plan. The reduction must apply to the entire set of arms sold from the U.S. \-- "Arms" is a mass noun

<https://blog.harwardcommunications.com/2017/04/12/the-difference-between-countable-and-uncountable-nouns-unit-and-mass-nouns/>

Mass nouns only have one form: e.g. furniture, clothes. So you can't say
1 furniture, 2 furnitures, 3 furnitures etc. This is why mass nouns are
also called uncountable nouns. **[Mass nouns cannot be used with
a/an]{.underline}**. WRONG: a furniture Mass nouns are fixed as singular
or plural. RIGHT: furniture, clothes WRONG: furnitures, a clothe
However, it may be possible to use "a piece of / an item of" for
singular and "some" for plural. RIGHT: a piece of furniture, some
furniture / an item of clothing, some clothes You can use e.g. the
furniture for both singular and plural references. **[Unit nouns usually
refer to one or many separate items or units]{.underline}**. E.g. a
chair/chairs, an office/offices, a client/clients, etc. **[Mass nouns
usually refer to: ideas, concepts]{.underline}** (e.g. approval,
employment) substances (e.g. meat, metal) liquids (e.g. water, beer)
powders (e.g. dust, sugar) Some words may be either a unit noun or a
mass noun, e.g. chicken Unit: My parents keep chickens. (birds) Mass: I
don't usually eat chicken. (meat) Compare: "I found a piece of chicken
in my soup." (mass = a piece of meat) "I found a piece of a chicken in
my soup." (unit = a piece of a bird) There are 4 **[types of mass
nouns:]{.underline}** Singular nouns that are always mass nouns
**[Plural nouns that are always mass nouns]{.underline}** Nouns that can
be unit nouns or mass nouns and have the same meaning Nouns that can be
unit nouns or mass nouns but have different meanings 1. Singular nouns
that are always mass nouns These nouns have no plural form. Examples:
furniture equipment advice information In many languages information is
a unit noun, and has both singular and plural forms. This is NOT the
case in English. As a result mistakes with information are very common.
WRONG: The informations that you sent us in your last email are out of
date. RIGHT: The information that you sent us in your last email is out
of date. 2. **[Plural nouns that are always mass nouns]{.underline}**
These nouns **[have no singular form.]{.underline}** They take the
plural verb form ("are", not "is") except for "news" which takes "is".
**[Examples:]{.underline}** clothes trousers scissors thanks news
customs **[arms (i.e. weapons)]{.underline}** remains.

#### Mass nouns require treating the noun as a whole without reference to specific parts

**Gillon 4** Brendan S. Gillon Professor. Department of Linguistics
McGill University, TOWARDS A COMMON SEMANTICS FOR ENGLISH COUNT AND MASS
NOUNS, In Semantics: A Reader edited by Steven Davis, Brendan S. Gillon
p. 395

Bunt (1985. pp. 45-46) goes on to claim that \"[[mass nouns provide the
possibility of talking about things as if they do not consist of
discrete parts]{.underline}]{.mark}\" and that \"a linguistic semantic
theory should take into account that the use of [[a mass noun is a way
of talking about things as if they were homogeneous masses.
i.e]{.underline}..]{.mark} as having some part-whole structure but
[[without singling out any particular parts]{.underline}]{.mark} and
without any commitments concerning the existence of minimal parts.\" He
calls this the homogeneous reference hypothesis and restatcs it as
follows: \"[Mass nouns refer to entities as having a part-whole
structure without singling out any particular parts]{.underline} and
without making any commitments concerning the existence of minimal
parts\" (Bunt 1985. p. 46: see also Bunt 1979. pp. 255-256).

#### This means that the affirmative has to enact a reduction that is applied across the board to arms from the U.S.

#### Topicality is a voting issue for reasons of precision and a limited division of ground.

## Future Sales 

### Shell

#### Interpretation---The affirmative must terminate a contract for existing sales not prevent future sales.

For the second question, the provision demonstrates that the goal of
adoption of such laws and regulations must be to 'prevent, reduce, and
control' MPLA. In so doing, the LOSC obliges States to 'taking into
account internationally agreed rules, standards, and recommended
practices and procedures'.480 Having considered the ordinary meanings of
the term 'prevent, reduce, and control', '[prevent' means 'to stop
something from happening]{.underline} or someone from doing
something.'481 [The word 'reduce' means 'to make something smaller in
size, amount, degree, importance etc]{.underline}.'482 and the word
'control' means 'to order, limit, or rule something or someone\'s
actions or behaviour.' 483 From the meanings, [the term 'prevent'
suggests an action to stop the future occurrence of something, whereas
the terms 'reduce']{.underline} and 'control', noting their difference,
[point to an action dealing with something that has already happened and
continues to occur, but needs to be made smaller]{.underline}, limited
or regulated. Also, control also applies to future pollution in the
sense that it limits the future pollution to be created or emitted not
to exceed the specified level. Therefore, the preliminary reading of
these terms suggests that laws and regulations adopted to deal with MPLA
must yield the result that conforms with these terms. In so doing, the
adoption of laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control MPLA
can be done by legislating primary or secondary regulations with the use
of various legal techniques and procedures and are underpinned by some
rules and principles of international law discussed in the previous
chapter. These legal techniques and procedures can be used to achieve
the prevention, reduction and control of MPLA depending on the design
and use of them. Noting that the measures outlined below are not
exhaustive and not exclusively limited to implement any specific
obligation, these are typical legal techniques and procedures used to
prevent, reduce, and control pollution and therefore protect the
environment. They can be categorised into two groups, that is, (1)
substantive and (2) procedural legal techniques and measures. They can
be discussed hereunder.

#### The affirmative blocks future sales---they do not break existing contracts

#### It is a voting issue for reasons of precision, limits and ground---There are an infinite number of potential future sales an aff might block. Requiring the affirmative to break contracts ensures predictable negative ground.

#### Terminating existing contracts is a legitimate approach to the topic---The AECA allows termination of existing sales

Service U.S. Arms Sales to Pakistan November 8, 2007 -- August 24, 2009,
https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS22757.html

The statutory authority governing U.S. arms sales to Pakistan is found
in the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).7 This statute sets out terms and
conditions that must be met before any country can be permitted to
purchase any item on the United States Munitions List. An essential
requirement is that the country seeking U.S. weapons be \"eligible\" to
purchase them. Thus, if there is no other prohibition in other U.S. law
that would preclude the sale of a weapon to Pakistan, then it would be
\"eligible\" to make such a purchase from the United States. Because a
country is eligible to purchase a weapon does not mean that the United
States is obligated to sell it.8 [Should the United States government
choose to do so, it can stop the transfer of defense
articles]{.underline} and services to Pakistan [for which valid
contracts exist]{.underline}, without finding it in violation of an
applicable agreement with the United States relating to permissible uses
of weapons previously sold. [The authority for suspension of deliveries
or defense items or cancellation of military sales contracts is found
in]{.underline} sections 2(b) and 42(e)(1)-(2) of [the
AECA]{.underline}. Section 2(b) of the Arms Export Control Act permits
the Secretary of State, under the President\'s direction, to, among
other things, determine \"whether there shall be delivery or other
performance\" regarding sales or exports under the AECA in order that
\"the foreign policy of the United States is best served thereby.\"
Section 42(e)(1)9 of the Arms Export Control Act states that: Each
contract for sale entered into under sections 21, 22, 29 and 30 of this
Act, and each contract entered into under section 27(d) of the Act,
shall provide that such contract may be canceled in whole or in part, or
its execution suspended, by the United States at any time under unusual
or compelling circumstances if the national interest so requires.
Section 42(e)(2)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act further states that:
Each export license issued under section 38 of this Act shall provide
that such license may be revoked, suspended, or amended by the Secretary
of State, without prior notice, whenever the Secretary deems such action
to be advisable. Thus, [all government-to-government agreements or
licensed commercial contracts for the transfer of defense
articles]{.underline} or defense services [may be halted]{.underline},
modified, [or terminated by the executive branch]{.underline} should it
determine that it is advisable to do so. In this context, should the
Bush Administration decide that actions taken by the government of
Pakistan are contrary to the national security interests of the United
States, [the President can suspend or terminate existing arms sales
agreements or prevent the delivery of weapons previously
ordered,]{.underline} as he deems appropriate. The [Congress can also
pass legislation that would suspend, modify, or terminate any arms sale
contract should it choose to do so]{.underline}.

### AT: Mass Noun

#### Mass nouns do not mean the entire class---It means a set from which you can select

**Doetjes 97** Doetjes, Jenny PhD in Linguistics, University of Leiden,
Netherlands (1997) Quantifiers and Selection (Chapter 2 is \"Mass and
Count Properties of Nouns and Verbs\").
http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/nu/471/F03/doetjes2.pdf

Chierchia, to the contrary, argues that all nouns have minimal parts in
their extension, including typical mass nouns such as water. The
structure corresponding to a mass noun is hence an atomic join
semi-lattice, as the one in (14). He illustrates his point of view
mostly by examples of the furniture type. His 'inherent plurality
hypothesis' generalizes over mass nouns such as water and collective
mass nouns such as furniture as well. [A mass noun simply denotes a
set]{.underline} of ordinary individuals[, plus all the
pluralities]{.underline} of such individuals. [For example \"change\"
denotes]{.underline}, roughly, [single coins **and** the possible sets
of pluralities of coins]{.underline}. This view is an \"atomistic\" one:
we are committed to claim that for each mass noun there are minimal
objects of that kind, just like for count nouns, even if the size of
these minimal parts may be vague. Chierchia (1995:2) In what follows I
will argue that the class of **[mass nouns should not be viewed as a
single homogeneous class]{.underline}**. There are two types. On the one
hand, the 'mass mass nouns', which seem to have homogeneous reference,
in accordance with the Bunt/Landman approach, and on the other the
'count mass nouns', or collectives, which have minimal parts. Mass mass
nouns are mass from a syntactic point of view (no Number morphology,
incompatibility with cardinals etc.) and from a semantic point of view
(no minimal parts), while the count mass nouns are mass from a syntactic
point of view only, and not from a semantic point of view.

#### Mass nouns refer to a set of things that may be divisible

**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 13**

The Logic of Mass Expressions Mar 8, 2013,
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-massexpress/

The purely set-theoretic approach By contrast, the purely set-theoretic
approach (Burge 1972; Grandy 1973; Montague 1973\[5\]) treats [mass
nouns]{.underline} as ordinary predicates that **[denote
sets]{.underline}**\[6\]. [Mass predication is interpreted as **set
membership**]{.underline}. For any mass noun M and predicate P: This is
M is true iff \[this\] ⊆ \[M\] Some M P is true iff \[M\] ∩ \[P\] ≠ ∅,
where \[this\] is the set whose elements are what is demonstrated, \[M\]
is the set having for elements everything that is M, \[P\] is the set
having for elements everything that P. A difficulty for this approach is
to specify, for any mass noun M, what the "portions of M" are. This
difficulty appears especially clearly with definite descriptions, as in
The gold on the table weighs fifty grams. If the description the gold on
the table denotes the set having for elements everything that is gold on
the table, then how can we evaluate the truth of the sentence? It would
not do to give the sum of all weights (cf. Bunt 1985: 41). So it seems
we must impose restrictions on the elements of the set \[the gold on the
table\].\[7\] Now comes a second and crucial difficulty concerning
identity over time. Consider: The clay that was on the desk on July 1st
is identical with the clay that was on the table on July 2nd. (Context
of utterance: three solid bits of clay were on the desk on July 1st, and
two solid bits of clay were on the table on July 2nd. Example inspired
by Cartwright 1965.) Which set could make \[the clay that was on the
desk on July 1st\] = \[the clay that was on the table on July 2nd\]
true? What about the set of all minimal parts of clay, i.e., the set of
all the instances of clay that have no other instance of clay as part?
However, with mass nouns like garbage, it is not clear what the minimal
parts would be (cf. Pelletier & Schubert 2003). And more crucially, [one
cannot exclude a priori the possibility that what a given mass noun
applies to may be indefinitely divisible]{.underline}. So the semantics
should not require mass nouns to have minimal parts (cf. Bunt 1985;
Gillon 1992). (See section 9 for a solution to this problem within the
framework of non-singular logic; see Steen 2012, section 2.3, for
various metaphysical considerations concerning the purely set-theoretic
approach.)

#### Examples prove---Water is a mass noun. If you said you should drink water it would not mean drink all water but drink some water. Experience is a mass noun. If you said experience is required to apply for a job it would not mean you need all experience but you need something in the category of experience.

## Substantially

#### Legally Substantially is a term that is judged by reasonableness---There is no single standard

**U.S. Supreme Court 88** Antonin Scalia writing opinion of the court in
Samuel R. PIERCE, Jr., Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
Petitioner, v. Myrna UNDERWOOD et al. No. 86-151,
<https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/552>

Before proceeding to consider whether the trial court abused its
discretion in this case, we have one more abstract legal issue to
resolve: the meaning of the phrase \"substantially justified\" in 28
U.S.C. 2412(d)(1)(A). [The Court of Appeals]{.underline}, following
Ninth Circuit precedent, [held that the Government\'s position was
\"substantially justified\" if it \"had a reasonable basis]{.underline}
both in law and in fact.\" 761 F.2d, at 1346. The source of that
formulation is a Committee Report prepared at the time of the original
enactment of the EAJA, which commented that \"[the test of whether the
Government position is substantially]{.underline} justified [is
essentially one of reasonableness]{.underline} in law and fact.\"
H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 96-1434, p. 22 (1980). In this petition, the
Government urges us to hold that \"substantially justified\" means that
its litigating position must have had \"some substance and a fair
possibility of success.\" Brief for Petitioner 16. Respondents, on the
other hand, contend that the phrase imports something more than \"a
simple reasonableness standard,\" Brief for Respondents 24---though they
are somewhat vague as to precisely what more, other than \"a high
standard,\" and \"a strong showing,\" id., at 28. In addressing this
issue, we make clear at the outset that we do not think it appropriate
to substitute for the formula that Congress has adopted any judicially
crafted revision of it---whether that be \"reasonable basis in both law
and fact\" or anything else. \"Substantially justified\" is the test the
statute prescribes, and the issue should be framed in those terms. That
being said, there is nevertheless an obvious need to elaborate upon the
meaning of the phrase. The broad range of interpretations described
above is attributable to the fact that the word \"substantial\" can have
two quite different---indeed, almost contrary---connotations. On the one
hand, it can mean \"considerable in amount, value, or the like; large,\"
Webster\'s New International Dictionary 2514 (2d ed. 1945) as, for
example, in the statement, \"He won the election by a substantial
majority.\" On the other hand, it can mean \"that is such in substance
or in the main,\" ibid.---as, for example, in the statement, \"What he
said was substantially true.\" Depending upon which connotation one
selects, \"substantially justified\" is susceptible of interpretations
ranging from the Government\'s to the respondents\'. We are not,
however, dealing with a field of law that provides no guidance in this
matter. [Judicial review of agency action]{.underline}, the field at
issue here, [regularly proceeds under the rubric of \"substantial
evidence]{.underline}\" set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
U.S.C. 706(2)(E). [That phrase **does not mean** a large or considerable
amount of evidence, but rather \"such relevant evidence as **a
reasonable mind** might accept as adequate]{.underline} to support a
conclusion.\" Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59
S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). In an area related to the present
case in another way, the test for avoiding the imposition of attorney\'s
fees for resisting discovery in district court is whether the resistance
was \"[substantially]{.underline} justified,\" Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.
37(a)(4) and (b)(2)(E). To our knowledge, that [has never been described
as meaning]{.underline} \"justified [to a high degree,\" but rather has
been said to be satisfied if there is a \"genuine
dispute]{.underline},\" Advisory Committee\'s Notes on 1970 Amendments
to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 37(a)(4), 28 U.S.C.App., p. 601; see, e.g., Quaker
Chair Corp. v. Litton Business Systems, Inc., 71 F.R.D. 527, 535 (SDNY
1976), or \"if reasonable people could differ as to the appropriateness
of the contested action,\" Reygo Pacific Corp. v. Johnston Pump Co., 680
F.2d 647, 649 (CA9 1982); see 8 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice
and Procedure § 2288, p. 790 (1970); SEC v. Musella, 1984 CCH
Fed.Sec.L.Rep. ¶ 91,647, p. 99,282 (SDNY 1984) available on WESTLAW,
1984 WL 832; Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604, 614 (Md.1983).
We are of the view, therefore, that as between the two commonly used
connotations of **[the word \"substantially]{.underline}**,\" the one
most naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not \"justified
to a high degree,\" but rather \"justified in substance or in the
main\"---that **[is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a
reasonable person.]{.underline}** That is no different from the
\"reasonable basis both in law and fact\" formulation adopted by the
Ninth Circuit and the vast majority of other Courts of Appeals that have
addressed this issue. See United States v. Yoffe, 775 F.2d 447, 449-450
(CA1 1985); Dubose v. Pierce, 761 F.2d, at 917-918; Citizens Council of
Delaware County v. Brinegar, 741 F.2d 584, 593 (CA3 1984); Anderson v.
Heckler, 756 F.2d 1011, 1013 (CA4 1985); Hanover Building Materials,
Inc. v. Guiffrida, 748 F.2d 1011, 1015 (CA5 1984); Trident Marine
Construction, Inc. v. Dis- trict Engineer, 766 F.2d 974, 980 (CA6 1985);
Ramos v. Haig, 716 F.2d 471, 473 (CA7 1983); Foster v. Tourtellotte, 704
F.2d 1109, 1112 (CA9 1983) (per curiam); United States v. 2,116 Boxes of
Boned Beef, 726 F.2d 1481, 1486-1487 (CA10), cert. denied sub nom.
Jarboe-Lackey Feedlots, Inc. v. United States, 469 U.S. 825, 105 S.Ct.
105, 83 L.Ed.2d 49 (1984); Ashburn v. United States, 740 F.2d 843, 850
(CA11 1984). To be \"substantially justified\" means, of course, more
than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness; that is
assuredly not the standard for Government litigation of which a
reasonable person would approve.

#### The word substantially does not mean a specific quantitative amount and means without material qualification

The Court begins its construction of the phrase at issue with the
express language of Claim 1, which provides: \"(S)-\[enantiomer\]
substantially free of R- \[enantiomer\].\" (\'639 patent, col. 10, 11.
18-20.)5 The term \"substantially\" is commonly used in patents.
[\"\[W\]ords of approximation, such as]{.underline} \'generally\' and
[\'substantially,\' are descriptive terms]{.underline} commonly
[used]{.underline} in patent claims **[to avoid a strict numerical
boundary to the specified parameter]{.underline}**.\" Anchor Wall Sys.,
Inc. v. Rockwood Retaining Walls, \|nc., 340 F.3d 1298; 1310-11 (Fed.
Cir. 2003) (quotation and citation omitted). To the extent [the term
\"substantially\" has been interpreted to have more than one
meaning,]{.underline} the \"cases recognize the dual ordinary meaning of
this term as connoting a term of approximation or a term of magnitude.\"
Deering Precision Instruments, L.L.Cv. Vector Distribution Sys., lnc.,
347 F.3d 1314, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Ecolab, Inc. v.
Envirochem, \|nc., 264 F.3d 1358, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001)
(\"\[O\]rdinari\|y \'substantially\' means considerable in extent, or
largely but not wholly that which is specified\"). Here, the claim
language urges interpreting the term \"substantially\" within the phrase
\"substantially free\" as a term of approximation. 6 See Epcon Gas Sys.,
Inc. v. Bauer Compressors, lnc., 279 F.3d 1022, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 2002)
(\"The phrase \'substantially constant\' denotes language of
approximation, while the phrase \'substantially below\' signifies
language of magnitude, i.e, not insubstantia\|.\"); see also Deering,
347 F.3d at 1323 (noting [the term \"substantially\" has numerous
definitions, including]{.underline}, inter alia, \"largely\" or
\"essentially\"). That is, \"substantially\" is used to modify and
qualify the word \"free\" with which the term \"substantially\" is
associated. This interpretation is consistent with the manner in which
[the word is customarily defined]{.underline}. See Blacks Law
Dictionary, 1428 (6th ed. 1990) (defining substantially [as]{.underline}
\"essentially, [without material qualification]{.underline}, in the
main\"); Webster\'s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary 1897 (1 ed. 2001)
(defining \"substantial\" as \"of or pertaining to the essence of a
thing; essential, material, or important\").

#### Courts hold that Substantially means somewhere between total and slight---It is not a clearly defined term

**Supreme Court of Kansas 84** State v. Rose Annotate this Case 234 Kan.
1044 (1984) 677 P.2d 1011 STATE OF KANSAS, Appellant, v. EVELYN M. ROSE,
Appellee. No. 55,834 Supreme Court of Kansas. Opinion filed February 18,
1984.,
https://law.justia.com/cases/kansas/supreme-court/1984/55-834-1.html

Cases from other states discussing the meaning of \"substantial\" or
\"substantially\" are far too numerous to cite or discuss here. See 40
Words and Phrases, pp. 757-853, and 1983 Pocket Supp., pp. 134-205.

As these cases illustrate, [the qualifying term
\"substantially]{.underline},\" as used in K.S.A. 8-1749a, has a
well-recognized and understood meaning. It [is defined in Black\'s Law
Dictionary]{.underline} 1281 (5th ed. 1979), [as \"\[e\]ssentially;
without material qualification; in the main; in substance; materially;
in a substantial manner. About, actually, competently, and
essentially]{.underline}.\" \"[Substantial\" is defined in the same
dictionary]{.underline} at 1280 [as \"actually existing; real; not
seeming or imaginary]{.underline}; not illusive; solid; true; veritable
\.... Synonymous with material.\" Webster\'s New Collegiate Dictionary
1153 (1981) defines \"substantial\" in part as \"being largely but not
wholly that which is specified.\" By definition the term is relative and
must be considered within the context of the particular fact situation;
[in essence it means less than totally or the whole, but more than
imaginary]{.underline}. As such, the standard proscribed by the use of
\"substantially\" in 8-1749a establishes with reasonable certainty what
conduct is violative of the statute and subject to punishment. The use
of \"substantially\" in 8-1749a is similar to the use of \"material
deviation\" in K.S.A. 21-3405, which we held in State v. Randol was not
unconstitutionally vague and indefinite when the standard proscribed
therein is measured against the parameters of ordinary negligence on the
one hand and gross and wanton negligence on the other. 226 Kan. at 355.
\"Substantially\" is a word of general usage, commonly known and
understood by the public, which provides a reasonably definite objective
standard by which one reading the statute can understand and contemplate
what conduct it is that the act proscribes. The statute prohibits motor
vehicles from being equipped with one-way glass or other substances
applied to the windows forward of or adjacent to the driver\'s seat,
which prohibits or substantially impairs the ability to see into the
motor vehicle from the outside. The gravamen of the offense is clearly
the impairment of visibility into the motor vehicle from the outside.
Operators and \*1050 owners of vehicles are clearly and sufficiently
warned they cannot install one-way glass or apply other substances to
the windshield and side windows of a car or other vehicle which prevents
or impairs the ability to view the inside of the vehicle from the
outside. The trial court relied upon State v. Lackey, 232 Kan. 478,
wherein the word \"appreciable,\" as used in a statute regulating the
disposal of salt water produced in conjunction with the drilling of oil
or gas, was recognized by the court as having been defined in various
ways. It was capable of meaning either considerable or slight, which are
adjectives of opposite meanings, and by its very nature was vague, and
therefore unconstitutional. Such is not true with [the term
\"substantially]{.underline}\" as used in K.S.A. 8-1749a. It [defines a
standard between the extremes of total and complete impairment and
slight impairment]{.underline}, similar to the use of the phrase
\"material deviation\" discussed in State v. Randol, which was held not
to be unconstitutionally vague.
