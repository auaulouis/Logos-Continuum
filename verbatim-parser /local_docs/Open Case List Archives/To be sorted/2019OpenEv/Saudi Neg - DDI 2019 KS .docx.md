#### The United States Federal Government should maintain arms sales to Saudi Arabia on the explicit condition that Saudi Arabia and Iran hold consistent bilateral negotiations on issue areas in the Saudi-Iranian relationship, including but not limited to flashpoints such as the war in Yemen, Qatari diplomacy and ballistic missile proliferation. The United States federal government should enact substantive reporting and certification obligations to determine whether conditions have been met.

#### The United States Federal Government should hold trilateral talks between Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United States on issue areas in the Saudi-Iranian relationship, including but not limited to flashpoints such as the war in Yemen, Qatari diplomacy and ballistic missile proliferation. 

#### Iran-Saudi talks decrease conflict and increase cooperation, preventing escalation

our two countries could make peace and bring stability to the
Middle East,"
<http://theconversation.com/saudi-and-iran-how-our-two-countries-could-make-peace-and-bring-stability-to-the-middle-east-118696>

Relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic
of Iran have rarely been worse, regarding the attacks on the oil tankers
in the Gulf of Oman -- for which [both
sides](https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1139108730996477952) blame
[each
other](https://twitter.com/SaudiEmbassyUSA/status/1139302532105277442https:/twitter.com/SaudiEmbassyUSA/status/1139302532105277442).
Nevertheless, **[in the history of relations between the two countries,
there have been regular shifts between tension and
rapprochement]{.underline}** -- and **[things can change for the better
once again]{.underline}**. As an Iranian and a Saudi, working as
research fellows [for peace
studies](http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/richardson-institute/), we believe **[it
is time that our two countries seek to manage the conflict, improve
their dialogue and begin the peace building process]{.underline}**. And
we are hopeful that this could happen. But how? **[Peace]{.underline}**
cannot be achieved overnight; it **[requires]{.underline}** a range of
factors to strengthen **[diplomatic ties]{.underline}** and decrease the
level of enmity between the two states. First, we suggest both states'
politicians soften the language in their speeches, **[altering the
hostile rhetoric to a more moderate one]{.underline}**. This **[would
open new paths towards a direct and constructive
dialogue]{.underline}**, reducing the tensions that are affecting the
two countries, the region and, potentially, the world. Sabre-rattling
**[Direct dialogue between the two regional actors could launch
negotiations that may lead to more stability in the
region.]{.underline}** The existing regional turmoil has had a
detrimental impact on relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran over
Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Bahrain [and
Yemen](https://fpc.org.uk/publications/saudi-arabia-and-iran/). **[The
\[Yemen war\]]{.underline}**, which has caused a \[dramatic humanitarian
crisis\], **[remains one of the main areas of conflict between Saudi
Arabia and Iran, but it also offers ground for talks between the two
states]{.underline}**. Both **[Saudi Arabia and Iran agree that the
conflicts in Yemen and Syria can only be ended through the
implementation of political, rather than military,
solutions]{.underline}**. **[If Saudi Arabia and Iran can take steps
toward political compromises in Syria and Yemen, this subsequently will
reflect positively on the trust building proces]{.underline}**s. While
Saudi Arabia relies on its strategic Western allies and its
ever-increasing military expenditure, Iran, which has been [isolated by
the
US](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4728473/president-trump-announces-withdrawal-iran-nuclear-deal),
prefers a more regional approach. Indeed, Saudi Arabia may have to
ignore US protests to sit down at the negotiating table with Iran. But
**[the will for closer ties is]{.underline}**, perhaps**[,
there]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[Iran's foreign minister]{.underline}**,
Mohammad Javad Zarif, **[declared]{.underline}** on March 13, 2018:
**[We believe that security of our neighbours is our security and
stability within our neighbourhood is our stability. I hope they \[Saudi
Arabia\] have the same feeling and I hope that they come to talks with
us for resolving these problems]{.underline}**. There is no reason for
hostility between Iran and Saudi Arabia. However, we tell the Saudis
that you cannot provide security from outside of the region. Adel
Al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, also
recently stated in [an
interview](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-middle-east-48460860/adel-al-jubeir-saudi-arabia-does-not-want-a-war-with-iran)
that his country "does not want war with Iran, but will not tolerate
what it considers hostile Iranian activity in the Middle East".
Suspicions clearly remain, but such pronouncements could be viewed as a
pause in hostilities, a turning point that could bring both sides closer
together to resolve tensions. **[There are also domestic reasons for a
reduction in tensions, with both states building strategic plans for the
future.]{.underline}** Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has embarked on an
ambitious socioeconomic plan to diversify the country's economy by
curbing its historic dependency on oil and challenging conservative
social constructs and norms by unshackling society from some past
constraints. In a state where most of the population is under the age of
30, [Vision 2030](https://vision2030.gov.sa/en) serves as a mega project
that will lead the country to modernise economically and socially. The
same goes for Iran. The country has adopted a promising strategic plan
called the [20-Year National Vision of the Islamic Republic of
Iran](http://irandataportal.syr.edu/20-year-national-vision)which has
social, economic, and political objectives. But to be successfully
implemented, both countries' strategies will need stable societies and
vibrant economies which cannot be attained in a hostile neighbourhood.
Integration and cooperation will be essential. Diplomacy is the solution
It is evident that Saudi Arabia and Iran will benefit more from direct
dialogue than hostile rhetoric. **[Through discussing and working
together on domestic, regional and international issues, it is in the
interests of both states]{.underline}** -- and the wider region -- **[to
reduce conflict and increase cooperation through diplomatic
ties]{.underline}**. The gradual shift from hostile to inclusive
rhetoric by politicians is a helpful first step, but **[it
is]{.underline}** also **[necessary for Saudi and Iran to take practical
action in their bilateral relationship]{.underline}**. It is expected
for states to compete in their sphere of influence, but **[pragmatism
must prevail]{.underline}** if both countries want to put an end to
their conflicts in the region.

### Solvency

#### Saudi-Iran talks are key to restore peace to the Middle East and ensure no escalation

**[Sager & Mousavian 5/14]{.underline}** - Abdulaziz Sager is the
chairman and founder of the Gulf Research Center, based in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia. Hossein Mousavian is a specialist in Middle East security and
nuclear policy at Princeton University and a former spokesman for Iran's
nuclear negotiating team. "It's Time for the Leaders of Saudi Arabia and
Iran to Talk,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/opinion/saudi-arabia-iran.html>

We write as citizens and foreign policy veterans of two countries that
most Americans presume are locked in mortal combat: Iran and Saudi
Arabia. In fact, **[after decades of proxy conflict and frozen
ties]{.underline}** between our countries, we believe **[now is the time
to explore a new foundation for a lasting peace]{.underline}** in our
region. Neither of us is a starry-eyed idealist. We are both hardened
realists with distrust for one another, and that mistrust is shared at
the top levels of our respective governments. At the same time, **[we
have seen the destructive consequences of crises in which our countries
side with one or another government or movement]{.underline}** involved
in a competition for power --- for example **[in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon,
Bahrain or Iraq]{.underline}**. While **[we each blame the other side
for this pattern]{.underline}**, we agree that **[the net
result]{.underline}** has been costly, **[has eroded the confidence of
the people our governments serve, and has wasted incalculable resources
and countless lives]{.underline}** that should have been used to build a
new Middle East, rather than tear it down. **[The time for dialogue is
now, because the situations in the historic conflict zones are ripe for
diplomacy]{.underline}**. First, **[in Iraq, both Iran and Saudi Arabia
have embraced a new]{.underline}** government in **[Baghdad led by a
prime minister and a president who are pragmatic]{.underline}** and have
good ties to both of our countries. This is an important opening we must
seize. Second**[, the war in Syria has reached a point near an
ending,]{.underline}** with less violence and the defeat of the Islamic
State there. **[Both]{.underline}** of our **[countries believe Syria's
territorial integrity must be maintained]{.underline}**. We call for
respect of the principle of noninterference in Syria's internal affairs,
and respect for the Syrian people's right to determine their own fate.
**[In Yemen, we disagree about the root causes of the conflict, but we
agree that it has ushered in a humanitarian disaster. Both of our
countries should support the process being led by the United Nations to
end the conflict in the coming months.]{.underline}** Lebanon is now led
by a new government and we agree that it is up to the people of Lebanon
to sort out their affairs on their own. Finally, in Bahrain, we both
support the country's sovereignty, integrity, democratic aspirations,
and stability based on the will of its people. The bottom line is that
**[these]{.underline}** five **[conflict zones]{.underline}**, long
sources of contests and misery, **[appear to be settling into a
relatively stable status quo from which we can begin to restore a
lasting peace in our region]{.underline}**. Although we each accuse the
other side of being the source of instability in the region, **[we know
through our own difficult dialogue over many months that the conditions
exist for direct and continuous discussions with open channels between
our capitals and our citizens]{.underline}**. **[We do not need to agree
on everything before agreeing on some things and taking the first, most
difficult, steps of dialogue]{.underline}**. Our citizens should be
first and foremost in our minds, and the world's. Iran and Saudi Arabia
have a combined population of 115 million, nearly a third of whom are
under the age of 25. The future is upon us, and our youth will be
interconnected whether we like it or not. **[Sustainable peace and
security require good bilateral relations and regional cooperation
between Tehran and Riyadh.]{.underline}** Iran and Saudi Arabia have
significant differences, but they share common interests in many
critical issues, such as energy security, nuclear nonproliferation, and
Middle East stability. We hope that **[instead of widening the gulf
between our two countries, our leaders will build on the common ground
between our nations]{.underline}**, which represent the two main pillars
of the Muslim world.

#### US-Iran talks are key to deescalate current tensions

**[The Economist 6/29]{.underline}** -- Originally published in the
print version of Leaders. "As America and Iran inch closer to war, new
talks are needed,"
<https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/06/29/as-america-and-iran-inch-closer-to-war-new-talks-are-needed>

For nearly four years Iran's path to a nuclear weapon was blocked. The
deal it signed with America and other powers in 2015 limited its nuclear
programme to civilian uses, such as power-generation, and subjected them
to the toughest inspection regime in history. The experts agreed that
Iran was complying and that its nuclear activities were contained. But
then President Donald Trump ditched the nuclear deal and Iran resumed
stockpiling low-enriched uranium. It is now poised to breach the 300kg
cap set by the agreement. **[Iran]{.underline}** may hesitate before
crossing that line, but it is also threatening to increase the
enrichment level of its uranium, bringing it closer to the stuff that
goes into a bomb. Fortunately, Iran is not about to become a
nuclear-weapons power. Its breakout time is over a year. But it **[is
once again using its nuclear programme to heap pressure on
America.]{.underline}** That adds an explosive new element to an
already-volatile mix. **[America accuses Iran of
attacking]{.underline}** six **[ships in the Strait of
Horm]{.underline}**uz since May. On June 20th **[Iran shot down an
American spy drone. America insisted the aircraft was above
international waters, not Iran's]{.underline}**, and sent warplanes to
strike back. Ten minutes before they were due to hit targets inside Iran
Mr Trump called them off and contented himself with a cyber-attack
instead. **[Neithe]{.underline}**r Mr **[Trump, nor America's allies,
nor Iran wants a big new war in the Middle East]{.underline}**. Yet Mr
Trump's strategy of applying "maximum pressure" on Iran is making the
prospect more likely---because each side, issuing ever-wilder threats,
could end up misreading the other's red lines. The president's room for
manoeuvre is shrinking. **[As Iran turns more belligerent, calls for
action will grow,]{.underline}** not least from his own party (see
[article](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/06/29/breaking-the-nuclear-deal-ratchets-up-the-conflict-between-iran-and-america)).
**[Before things escalate out of control, both sides need to begin
talking]{.underline}**. That is not as unlikely as it sounds. Mr Trump's
Iran strategy is based on the premise that Barack Obama gave too much
away too easily when he negotiated the deal in 2015. Last year the
president set out to get better terms by reneging on the agreement and
reimposing the sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. This, his
advisers argue, will force a weakened Iran to accept a new deal that
lasts longer than the old one, most of which expires by 2030. They also
want curbs on Iran's missile programme and an end to its violent
meddling in the region. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, sees recent
Iranian aggression as a sign that the strategy is working. Hard-hitting
**[sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table in 2015, but they are
unlikely to lead to the transformation]{.underline}** Mr **[Trump
wants]{.underline}**. One reason is that he has discredited Hassan
Rouhani, Iran's president and a champion of the nuclear deal. Hardliners
are now calling the shots. Another is that America is acting alone. In
2015, in a rare moment of international unity, it had the support of its
European allies as well as Russia and China. Maximum pressure comes with
extra risks, to boot. The mullahs and their Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps want to prove their mettle by showing that Mr Trump's actions have
costs---for everyone. **[On top of the attacks on ships and drones,
Iranian proxies have hit pipelines in Saudi Arabia and are suspected of
having struck Iraqi bases hosting American troops]{.underline}**. If
sanctions are not lifted, **[Iranian officials may resort to closing the
Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of the world's oil
passes.]{.underline}** **[Hawks]{.underline}** like John Bolton, Mr
Trump's national security adviser, **[retort that if Iran wants war,
that is what it will ge]{.underline}**t---especially if it shows signs
of dashing for a nuclear bomb, which could trigger disastrous
proliferation in the Middle East. **[But this is the riskiest
calculation of all.]{.underline}** Having pulled out of a working
deal**[, America may not win the backing of European allies for
strikes]{.underline}**. China and Russia would vehemently oppose any
action at all. **[Perhaps sanctions]{.underline}** or war will cause the
regime to crumble**[. But that is hardly a strategy]{.underline}**: Cuba
has resisted sanctions for decades. More probably, a defeated Iran would
heed the lesson of nuclear-armed North Korea and redouble its efforts to
get a bomb. Attacking Iran's nuclear facilities would not destroy its
know-how, as even Mr Bolton admits. If, as is likely, Iran barred
international inspectors, its programme would move underground,
literally and figuratively, making it very hard to stop. The alternative
to today's course is talks between America and Iran. Just now that looks
far-fetched. Iran's foreign ministry says American sanctions imposed on
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and other top officials this
week mark "the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy". Mr Rouhani
has suggested that the White House is "mentally handicapped"---after
which Mr Trump threatened "obliteration". But optimists will remember
similar clashes between America's president and Kim Jong Un, North
Korea's despot, before they met in Singapore and "fell in love", as Mr
Trump put it. When he is not threatening to annihilate the mullahs, Mr
**[Trump is offering to talk without preconditions]{.underline}** and to
"make Iran great again". He does not want the prospect of war in the
Middle East looming over his re-election campaign. Likewise, in Iran the
economy is shrinking, prices are rising and people are becoming fed up.
Pressure is growing on Mr Khamenei to justify his intransigence**[. Love
could yet bloom. America might coax Iran back to the table with a
gesture of good faith]{.underline}**, such as reinstating waivers that
let some countries buy Iranian oil. Iran, in turn, could promise to
comply with the nuclear deal again. Behind the scenes, its leaders have
expressed a willingness to sign something like the old agreement with
additions---such as extending parts of the deal beyond 2030.
**[Negotiations would never be easy; the Iranians are infuriating to
deal with. But that would let the president claim
victory]{.underline}**, as he did with the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement, which his administration signed last year and which looks a
lot like its predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement. What
of a deal that also curbs Iran's missile programme and restrains it in
the region? As Mr Trump seems to realise, biting everything off in one
go is unrealistic. A new deal cannot solve all the problems posed by
Iran or normalise ties with America after decades of enmity. It may not
even lift all America's sanctions. Neither did the first agreement. But,
if done right, a deal would put Iran's nuclear programme back in a box,
making it easier to tackle all those other problems without causing a
war.

### Saudi Says Yes

#### Exercising our influence to deescalate avoids Assurances and solves, Saudi will agree

the Middle East Aren\'t Always Loyal to Iran,"

The killing a month ago of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical
of Riyadh, under the most peculiar of circumstances is the latest in a
litany of acrimonious moves Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has
made since 2015. Such actions have seemingly increased after Crown
Prince Mohammed consolidated power by dramatically unseating his uncle
as crown prince and imprisoning his rivals in the Riyadh Ritz Carlton
for months in 2017. As Riyadh has flexed its muscles in ways that appear
to complicate U.S. interests in the region, Washington has seemingly
acquiesced to, or at times seemed to welcome, Saudi adventurism,
including a devastating military campaign abroad supported by limited
U.S. military assistance. To many, the United States appears beholden to
the kingdom. In actuality, **[Riyadh needs Washington more than
Washington needs Riyadh]{.underline}**, and the **[missteps in Saudi
decisionmaking have caused significant damage to the kingdom's
reputation, reinforcing its dependence on America]{.underline}**. **[The
United States has an opportunity to exert its influence to shape Saudi
behavior]{.underline}**, perhaps more than ever before. Saudi Arabia has
long relied on the United States as its primary security guarantor.
Today, **[the]{.underline}** Middle Eastern **[nation benefits from U.S.
training, arms, intelligence cooperation and]{.underline}**, up until
recently, **[refueling efforts for the Saudi-led air war in
Yemen]{.underline}**. Yet, despite the Saudi reliance on the United
States in key areas pertaining to political and military affairs,
America has been reluctant to press the Kingdom's decisionmakers to
change their behavior. Domestically, many have long questioned whether
the breadth and depth of the ties between the two countries serve U.S.
interests, and the relationship has long been a point of contention in
American foreign policy circles. Although the United States plays a
disproportionate role in the Middle Eastern nation's security, it
doesn't always use this to enforce its values and interests, or see this
as a point of leverage. Recent developments heightened long-simmering
tensions between Riyadh and Washington. Criticism of the Kingdom's
foreign policy has become more pronounced since the beginning of the war
in Yemen in 2015 and the Gulf crisis two years later that pit Saudi
Arabia and its allies against Qatar. While **[there is seemingly a push
to "punish" Riyadh by imposing sanctions and halting support for the
Yemen war]{.underline}**, there does not appear to be a fundamental
shift taking place in U.S. policy. While the administration is taking
some steps to placate critics and Riyadh is reportedly holding officials
accountable for Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi consulate, history
suggests that this is unlikely to lead to a significant departure from
the status quo. U.S.-Saudi relations were founded on two core interests
that have been the hallmark of the partnership since its inception in
1945---security and oil. **[Security has played an outsize role in the
bilateral ties, particularly as political tensions have historically
produced significant strain]{.underline}**. Low points in the broader
relationship include the 1973 oil embargo and the 9/11 terrorist
attacks. Despite these fractious issues, the ties between Riyadh and
Washington have endured. **[This durability reflects the reasons behind
the cooperation: A convergence of needs and interests that remain
today]{.underline}**: Oil in return for security. But **[these driving
interests may be changing]{.underline}** as the United States pursues
renewable energy in a bid to become less dependent on petro states and
as Saudi Arabia aspires to "go it alone" to ensure its security and that
of its immediate neighbors. These opposing goals have placed pressure on
the relationship without derailing it. Since Crown Prince Mohammed
consolidated power, however, divergent Saudi and U.S. interests and
worldviews have come to the forefront. Initially, many Americans praised
the prince as a reformer, bringing the kingdom into the 21st century.
But it soon became clear that the reforms were more limited than many
had hoped and that the efforts were taking place against the backdrop of
problematic policies at home and abroad. Several developments have
garnered more scrutiny of Saudi policies: The manner in which the prince
has silenced those he views as his opponents---including
Khashoggi---coupled with international incidents, chiefly the ongoing
devastating Saudi-led efforts in the war in Yemen, creating the world's
worst humanitarian crisis, and the internecine rift among the Arab Gulf
states. Both the Obama and Trump administrations watched as the
kingdom's policies became more assertive, leading to the widely held
assumption that America can't change the Saudi calculus. But this is far
from the truth. As the Saudis' chief political and military partner and
the undisputed security guarantor in the Middle East, the United States
has considerable influence it can wield over Saudi decision making. It
has thus far gone virtually unused. In reality, **[the United States may
have more leverage over Saudi Arabia today than at any other
time]{.underline}** except during the 1991 Gulf War. Trump's ascension
to the U.S. presidency helped alleviate some of Saudi Arabia's concerns
that stemmed from President Obama's Middle East policies and,
consequently, afforded the United States more influence over the
kingdom. The Saudis had grown distrustful of U.S. commitment to the
region due to President Obama's plans to pivot to Asia and his
administration's response to the Arab Spring and pursuit of a nuclear
deal with Tehran. But President Trump made Riyadh the destination of his
first foreign trip in office and pledged to support the kingdom while
harshly criticizing its archenemy, Iran, and withdrawing from the
nuclear deal this past May. At the same time, Saudi Arabia has become
more reliant on the United States than when President Obama was in
office. **[Riyadh's contentious policies---like the war in Yemen and the
rift with its neighbors---have constrained its options and inadvertently
reinforced Saudi Arabia's need for U.S. military and political
support]{.underline}**, including security cooperation and intelligence
sharing. **[Prince Mohammed]{.underline}**'s legacy and perhaps even
power is presently tied to two initiatives: The Yemen war and Vision
2030---an ambitious program of social and economic reforms that Riyadh
plans to institute to diversify its economy. Neither objective is
apparently proceeding as the crown prince had hoped. And to succeed,
they **[will]{.underline}** likely **[require continued U.S.
support]{.underline}**. Until recently, President Trump was not inclined
to use these developments as leverage. Instead, he stood by the crown
prince even as U.S. military support to Saudi forces in
Yemen---including aerial refueling and advising on intelligence sharing
and targeting procedures---have come under attack in Congress and by
international rights groups. Some have argued that the administration
has emboldened Riyadh, giving it carte blanche to pursue its more
assertive policies. New details pertaining to Khashoggi's murder have
emerged, ostensibly tying the young Saudi monarch to the incident and
leading to mounting congressional pressure. But the Trump administration
has been willing to give the Saudis only a mere slap on the wrist
without fundamentally altering the dynamics of the U.S.-Saudi
relationship. The Trump administration is unlikely to end its support
for Saudi regional efforts or radically change its approach. But it
could **[consider using]{.underline}** its **[influence to encourage the
Saudi leadership to moderate its assertive and damaging policies abroad.
Rather than providing its assistance freely to Saudi Arabia, Washington
could utilize it to extract concessions from the Saudi leadership to
alter its behavior]{.underline}**. **[Making U.S. support
conditiona]{.underline}**l to initiatives tied to Prince Mohammed's
success **[provides Washington with a degree of sway over
the]{.underline}** brash **[monarch, who increasingly needs to produce a
"win"]{.underline}** in light of the reputational harm the Khashoggi
affair has done to t\\he kingdom, his legacy and perhaps even his hold
on power. **[The administration could consider]{.underline}** also
**[making conditional its support for the Saudi government's priority
programs with the goal of altering and shaping its behavior. This
includes]{.underline}** making the **[Saudis]{.underline}** take
responsibility for Khashoggi's brutal death, putting an end to
indiscriminate targeting practices in Yemen, **[altering the
government's harsh response to opposition inside and outside of the
Kingdom]{.underline}**, and ending the rift with Qatar. Naysayers of
such an approach might claim that it only deepens the transactionalism
on which the U.S.-Saudi relationship is presently based. But **[it is
worth recognizing that the partnership was founded on an explicit
alignment of interests, not values. By acknowledging this, the United
States would be better positioned to adopt an approach that best serves
its own interests.]{.underline}** At this point, the Saudi government
needs U.S. support more than the White House needs Saudi Arabia.

#### Iran, Saudi want political resolution through regional talks and diplomacy 

**[Al Jazeera 5/20]{.underline}** -- "Iran urges UN to launch talks over
\'alarming\' Gulf tensions,"
<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/iran-urges-launch-talks-alarming-gulf-tensions-190520201653885.html>

**[Iran has urged the [United

ambassador to the UN, made the appeal in a letter]{.underline}** to UN
Secretary-General [Antonio

and the Security Council on Monday. The letter came **[as tensions
mounted between Iran on one side and [United
States](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html)
and]{.underline}** its Gulf allies, **[Saudi Arabia and]{.underline}**
the United Arab Emirates, on **[the other]{.underline}**. On Sunday, US
President Donald Trump
[warned](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/trump-threatens-iran-seeks-fight-190520003050499.html)
Tehran of its \"official end\" should it threaten Washington. A day
later, Iran\'s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif
[denounced](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2019/05/iran-slams-genocidal-taunts-increases-uranium-production-190520134153162.html)
Trump\'s \"genocidal taunts\" and urged the US to address the Islamic
Republic with respect and not threats of war. In Monday\'s letter,
Ravanchi warned that \"the eruption of any possible conflict will soon
cross over from the regional level and will definitely have serious and
extensive implications on international peace and security.\" The
ambassador added that Iran \"will never choose war,\" but that \"if war
is imposed on us, Iran will vigorously exercise its inherent right to
self-defence\". The latest escalation began earlier this month with the
Trump\'s administration\'s deployment of bombers and an aircraft carrier
to the [Middle
East](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html). It
cited unspecified threats from
[Iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html) for the move,
which Tehran dismissed as \"psychological warfare\". In the ensuing
days, officials in the United Arab Emirates alleged that four oil
tankers sustained damage in a [sabotage
attack](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/sabotage-attacks-gulf-oil-vessels-190514184006381.html);

a warning that commercial airlines could be misidentified by Iran and
attacked, something dismissed by Tehran. Then on Sunday, a rocket was
fired into the Green Zone of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, which houses
government offices and embassies including the US mission. It was not
immediately clear who was behind the attack. The **[tensions are the
culmination of Trump\'s decision a year ago to pull the US out of
Tehran\'s nuclear deal with world powers]{.underline}**. While both
Washington and Tehran say they are not seeking war, many worry any
miscalculation could spiral out of control. Ravanchi said the UN must
not remain indifferent \"to addressing the root causes of the current
state of affairs\". He accused \"certain circles from outside of this
region\" of provocative policies and escalating tensions in the Gulf. Al
Jazeera\'s James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York,
said the Iranian ambassador did not mention the US in his appeal for
dialogue. \"**[Iran is proposing what it calls a win-win situation -
talks or constructive engagement between Iran and the Gulf
countries,\"]{.underline}** he said. \"Iran is saying this forum is
something Guterres could convene very easily \... Iran is trying to show
here that it\'s the reasonable one.\" Rising rhetoric Earlier on Monday,
UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric voiced concern over the rising rhetoric
between Washington and Tehran and urged both sides to dial down their
remarks. \"We would ask all parties to lower the rhetoric and lower the
threshold of action, as well,\" he said. UN officials are holding
contacts with the US and Iran at various levels to try to calm the
situation, said Dujarric, without providing details of the talks. The US
president took to Twitter again on Monday, saying Washington has not
tried to contact Iran for talks and that if the Islamic Republic wants
to negotiate, it will have to take the first step. \"Iran will call us
if and when they are ever ready. In the meantime, their economy
continues to collapse - very sad for the Iranian people!\" Trump said.
Separately, Oman\'s minister of state for foreign affairs made a
previously unannounced visit on Monday to Tehran, seeing Zarif, Iran\'s
state-run IRNA news agency reported. The visit by Yusuf bin Alawi comes
after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Oman\'s Sultan Qaboos bin

### Qatar Impact/Solvency/Thumper Argument

#### Qatari diplomacy discussions are key to bridging the US-Saudi-Iranian political gap 

**[Perry 5/20]{.underline}** -- Mark, American author specializing in

Hope in the Iran Crisis,"
<https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/why-tiny-qatar-may-be-our-greatest-hope-in-this-iran-crisis/>

In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and a host of
other Arab states broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed an
economic blockade, and launched an intense lobbying campaign in
Washington to undermine U.S.-Qatari relations. [The effort was
led](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/tillerson-and-mattis-cleaning-up-kushners-middle-east-mess/)
by Mohammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and best buddy to
Jared Kushner. The diplomatic dust-up took the U.S. by surprise, forcing
then-secretary of state Rex Tillerson into a round of mediation efforts.
Tillerson didn't succeed: Saudi Arabia and its allies not only
maintained their blockade, they doubled down on their anti-Qatar
lobbying efforts in the United States. Near the top of the Saudi and UAE
anti-Qatar agenda was convincing the U.S. to relocate al-Udeid. This
effort was aided by a constellation of Washington hawks as well as a
powerful group of pro-Israel advocates, who served as not-so-silent
partners in the Saudi enterprise. Among these was the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies, whose senior vice president, Jonathan Schanzer,
has waged a veritable [one-man
crusade](https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/07/25/hamas-rising/) to force
the U.S. to abandon its Qatar base. (Mr. Schanzer did not respond to
telephone inquiries seeking comment.) In July 2017, Schanzer [told the
House Foreign Affairs
Committee](https://www.amazon.com/Assessing-U-S-Qatar-Relationship-Subcommittee-Representatives/dp/1985299046)
that Qatar has "an alternate view of reality and morality," and went on
to provide four new basing options in the region---Iraqi Kurdistan,
Bahrain, the UAE, and Jordan. "It's just a lot of noise," a Centcom
officer told this writer of the FDD's efforts at the time. "Just ignore
it." That may be, but the "noise" over al-Udeid intensified throughout
all of 2018 and into this year. In mid-April, the pressure on Qatar over
al-Udeid became so intense that a high-level delegation from Qatar
visited Washington for economic meetings and to assess the anti-Udeid
campaign. The economic meetings weren't a secret, but the al-Udeid
assessment was. "Don't wave this off," a senior consultant to the Qatari
leadership said at the time. "The Saudis are pressuring the U.S. on
al-Udeid and the White House is listening. And, you know, they've got
friends here who are welcome in the Oval Office. It's a real worry." But
that worry, it seems, was misplaced. During their consultations, the
Qatari delegation was reassured that the U.S. was in al-Udeid to stay.
And for good reason: in January 2018, Qatar agreed to expand al-Udeid's
basing resources, and then, the next January, signed an agreement that
included an upgrade of its services at Hamad Port for use by the U.S.
Navy. The April consultations confirmed the commitment. "There is a lot
of building going on at al-Udeid and its impressive: new facilities, a
new gymnasium for American troops, and an upgrade of a lot of the
infrastructure," the Congressional Research Service's Kenneth Katzman,
one of America's foremost experts on the Middle East, told TAC. "I don't
see any hint whatsoever that the U.S. is rethinking its
military-to-military relationship with Doha. And there are no plans to
move al-Udeid. None. Zero." In fact, as a retired Centcom officer noted,
the Qatari delegation was told that while the U.S. military had
investigated other basing options, no one could match Qatar's
commitment. "The Emiratis made an offer," the officer said, "but
compared to the Qataris, it was pathetic. Not even close." The
U.S.-Qatar Defense Cooperation Agreement, this officer said, "is as
close to a sweetheart deal as you can get." Retired General Anthony
Zinni, a former Centcom commander brought on by the State Department to
mediate the Saudi-Qatar dispute (he has since left that position),
agrees: "I am not totally in the loop on this," he told me, "but moving
our base out of Qatar just doesn't make sense." In fact, not only is
relocating al-Udeid out of the question, since the start of the
anti-Qatar campaign U.S.-Qatari military cooperation has actually
increased. "**[I don't think the relationship between Qatar and the U.S.
has ever been better, and that includes military-to-military
coordination,]{.underline}**" Dr. John Duke Anthony, **[the head of the
National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations]{.underline}**, says. "**[The
U.S.-Qatar relationship is deeply rooted and based on
trust.]{.underline}** I know there's been an effort to get the U.S. to
abandon al-Udeid, but I would say that that effort has failed." Also
having failed is **[the Saudi and UAE effort to isolate
Qatar]{.underline}**---and starve it into submission. "I think we have
to be clear-eyed about the consequences of the Saudi-led blockade,"
Katzman says. "The Qataris were forced to import food to ease the
blockade, with the result that a lot of it now comes from Iran. And
Qatar was forced to shift many of its airline routes, to keep them out
of Saudi and Emirati airspace. The Iranians were happy to help. I think
it's clear: the blockade **[may have actually deepened relations between
Doha and Tehran]{.underline}**." For some, those enhanced relations
provide a told-ya-so moment (as in "see, we told ya they were in the
pockets of the mullahs"). But for others, **[Qatar's friendship with
Iran could well make the difference between war and
peace]{.underline}**. The truth of this was obvious last week when,
**[in the midst of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, Qatari
Foreign Minister]{.underline}** Mohammed bin **[al-Thani]{.underline}**
**[arrived in Tehran for talks aimed at dampening the
cris]{.underline}**is. While we don't what al-Thani said, senior U.S.
Air Force officers have long argued that America's forward deterrence
strategy in the Persian Gulf looks like "forward provocation" to the
Iranians. They say too that **[the]{.underline}** Trump
**[administration's decision to send additional bombers to al-Udeid and
another]{.underline}** aircraft carrier **[battle group to the Persian
Gulf will be perceived]{.underline}** in Iran **[as preparation for
war]{.underline}**. It's likely, as this writer has been told by senior
Pentagon officers, that **[al-Thani brought just the opposite message:
that the new deployments are not a preparation for war, but an attempt
to prevent it. Al-Thani]{.underline}**, senior Pentagon officials say,
**[continued these efforts into this weekend]{.underline}**. The
question is: will he be believed? "He's one of the best, a top-notch
diplomat. I wish he was ours," John Duke Anthony told me. "It might be
that the Iranians were a little miffed to see him, as he's not the
representative of a great power, but they know he has close relations
with the U.S. and influence in Washington. That matters." This seems
more than notionally true. **[Qatar matters. It's [the mouse that
roared](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mouse_that_roared)---the
Qataris, not the Saudis or Emiratis, have become America's most
important ally in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}**. But Qatar's outsize
influence has failed to check Washington's anti-Qatar warriors, who
continue to beat the drums over the tiny country's ties to the region's
"extremists" --and continue to call for the U.S. to abandon al-Udeid.
Most recently, FDD hosted newly minted Centcom commander Marine General
Kenneth MacKenzie, Jr. at a forum inaugurating their new ["Center on
Military and Political
Power"](https://www.fdd.org/events/2019/05/08/rising-to-the-threat-revitalizing-americas-military-and-political-power/)---which
is headed up by retired General H.R. McMaster, Donald Trump's former
national security advisor and the FDD's newest and most prominent hire.
MacKenzie's appearance at the forum shocked a number of his fellow
officers, as it seemed to signal that the Centcom head agreed with the
FDD's anti-Iran and anti-Qatar crusade. (Centcom spokespersons did not
respond to inquiries on MacKenzie's appearance.) But others dismissed
the criticism, including a retired senior officer who knows MacKenzie
and served with him. "Oh, come on, this doesn't mean anything," this
retired officer said. "MacKenzie did this for H.R., as a personal favor.
The people who think we should move al-Udeid just don't get it. The
Iranians would jump for joy. These **[anti-Qatar people are
idiots]{.underline}**. MacKenzie's not."

### Iran Says Yes

#### Iran is looking to improve its Saudi relationship now 

**[Agence France-Presse 5/1 -]{.underline}**

DOHA, QATAR - **[Iran said Wednesday it hopes to have good relations
with arch-rival Saudi Arabia and its allies, and called for an end to
their bitter dispute with Gulf neighbour Qatar]{.underline}**. **[Riyadh
broke off relations with Tehran in 2016]{.underline}** after protesters
angry at its execution of a top Shiite cleric torched its diplomatic
missions in Iran. The following year the kingdom and its allies Bahrain
and the United Arab Emirates imposed a trade and travel boycott on
Qatar, demanding that it mirror their hardline policies towards Iran and
the Muslim Brotherhood. \"**[We have extremely good relations with
Qatar, Kuwait, Oman,\" Iranian Foreign Minister]{.underline}** Mohammad
Javad Zarif **[said]{.underline}**, referring to the two Gulf Arab
countries which remained neutral in the dispute. Iran Designates All US

Tehran of its \"official end\" should it threaten Washington. A day
later, Iran\'s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif
[denounced](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2019/05/iran-slams-genocidal-taunts-increases-uranium-production-190520134153162.html)
Trump\'s \"genocidal taunts\" and urged the US to address the Islamic
Republic with respect and not threats of war. In Monday\'s letter,
Ravanchi warned that \"the eruption of any possible conflict will soon
cross over from the regional level and will definitely have serious and
extensive implications on international peace and security.\" The
ambassador added that Iran \"will never choose war,\" but that \"if war
is imposed on us, Iran will vigorously exercise its inherent right to
self-defence\". The latest escalation began earlier this month with the
Trump\'s administration\'s deployment of bombers and an aircraft carrier
to the [Middle
East](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html). It
cited unspecified threats from
[Iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html) for the move,
which Tehran dismissed as \"psychological warfare\". In the ensuing
days, officials in the United Arab Emirates alleged that four oil
tankers sustained damage in a [sabotage

#### Iranian hardliners are changing their stances now, open to talks with Trump

Conflict With U.S. Grows, Some Iran Hard-liners Suggest Talking to
Trump,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/world/middleeast/iran-hard-liners-trump-talks.html>

Iran's most revered Revolutionary Guards commander says talking with
President Trump would be admitting defeat. The country's supreme leader
has ruled out any dealings with Washington. But now**[, in a surprising
split among Iranian hard-liners, some are expressing]{.underline}** a
different opinion: **[It's time to sit down and resolve 40 years of
animosity with the United States, by talking directly]{.underline}** to
Mr. Trump. And **[the most striking voice in that]{.underline}**
contrarian **[group is former President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad]{.underline}**, largely **[known]{.underline}** in the West
**[for his anti-American bombast,]{.underline}** Holocaust denial, and
suspiciously lopsided victory in a disputed vote a decade ago that set
off Iran's worst political convulsions since the Islamic revolution.
"Mr. Trump is a man of action," Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a lengthy
telephone interview with The New York Times. "He is a businessman and
therefore he is capable of calculating cost-benefits and making a
decision. We say to him, let's calculate the long-term cost-benefit of
our two nations and not be shortsighted." **[Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks
are among several signals from different ends of Iran's political
spectrum that Iranian officials want to talk.]{.underline}** Those
signals reveal a fracture with the hard-liners led by the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has seized or harassed foreign ships
in the Persian Gulf --- including at least one British-registered tanker
impounded on Friday --- and raised the risk of a slide into armed
conflict. The risk was further punctuated by Mr. Trump's assertion on
Thursday that American naval forces in the region [had downed an Iranian
drone](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/iranian-drone-shot-down.html?module=inline),
which the Iranians have denied. "We hope for their sake they don't do
anything foolish," Mr. Trump said Friday. (Mr. Ahmadinejad, who spoke
before the Americans first reported their claim about the drone, said
through an aide on Friday that it had not changed his view that both
sides should talk.) Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, who
had previously insisted there could be no negotiations with the United
States unless it rejoined the nuclear agreement Mr. Trump abandoned last
year, said Thursday he was willing to meet with American senators to
discuss possible ways out of the nuclear crisis. For the first time, Mr.
Zarif floated modest steps that Tehran would be willing to take in
return for the simultaneous lifting of sanctions Mr. Trump reimposed.
Within the rivalries that pervade Iran's political hierarchy, the
American-educated Mr. Zarif is a big contrast to Mr. Ahmadinejad, who as
president pushed Mr. Zarif out of government. Yet both are now seeking
ways to communicate with the Trump administration. Mr. Ahmadinejad's
self-aggrandizing demagogy in some ways makes him Iran's version of Mr.
Trump, in the view of some Iranians. But he still commands a following
in the country of 80 million, mostly among low-income people who
associate his tenure with better economic times and cash subsidies from
the government. He also has a seat on the elite Expediency Council, a
body appointed by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to
supervise the work of elected officials. While he was disqualified from
running for president again two years ago, he still travels around the
country making speeches and writing open letters criticizing the
government and the judiciary. Unlike other hard-liners, he dares to
criticize the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps for its influence over
Iran's economy and the power it gives Mr. Khamenei, who has sole
authority to direct the vast paramilitary force. "Ahmadinejad is shaking
things up by boldly talking about all the issues that everyone knows but
nobody dares talk about publicly, and be willing to pay the cost," said
Roozbeh Mirebrahimi, an Iranian political analyst based in New York.
Lately he has become the most high-profile hard-line figure to advocate
the unorthodox view of talking with Mr. Trump. In The Times interview,
which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Ahmadinejad said that Tehran and
Washington should directly resolve the litany of disputes that began
with the 1979 revolution, the seizure of the United States Embassy, the
taking of American hostages, the mutual accusations of regional meddling
and all the rest. Mr. Ahmadinejad said Iran should scrap the approach of
enlisting Europe and other intermediaries to influence Mr. Trump over
his hostility to the 2015 nuclear agreement. This would be possible, Mr.
Ahmadinejad said, if Mr. Trump first eased some of his "maximum
pressure" tactics, most notably the onerous sanctions he reimposed after
having abandoned the agreement, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action, between Iran and the big powers. "**[World peace, economy and
culture would greatly benefit from us working together]{.underline}**,"
Mr. Ahmadinejad said. "The U.S. wants to address wider issues than the
J.C.P.O.A. The issues at stake are more important and wider than whether
the J.C.P.O.A. should live or die. **[We need to have a fundamental
discussion]{.underline}**." Mr. Ahmadinejad said he had written three
letters to Mr. Trump: in February 2017 to congratulate him on his
election; in June 2018 after Mr. Trump had exited the nuclear deal; and
last month as the forces of both countries were facing off in the
Persian Gulf. Mr. Ahmadinejad said he sent all three letters, which
offered long philosophical musings and governing advice, via mail to the
care of the Swiss ambassador in Tehran, via message to Mr. Trump's
Twitter account and to a White House email address. The Swiss Embassy
looks after American interests in Iran in the absence of direct
diplomatic ties. It was unclear if Mr. Trump ever received the letters.
White House officials said they needed more information about precisely
how and when they were sent but pointed out that Mr. Ahmadinejad could
not have directly messaged them via Twitter because Mr. Trump does not
follow him. The Swiss Embassy in Tehran declined through a spokesman to
comment. Mr. Ahmadinejad said he had not been reprimanded for attempting
to correspond with Mr. Trump and that Mr. Khamenei can change his mind
and approve negotiations with Washington if the administration shifts
its approach. He pointed out that Mr. Khamenei, who has the final word
on Iran's relations with the United States, had allowed nuclear talks
with the Americans under President Barack Obama. The timing of the
messages of both Mr. Ahmadinejad and Mr. Zarif were notable: **[The
Trump administration has sent several signals in recent days that it
wants to begin talks with Iran with "no preconditions."]{.underline}**
And for the first time since Mr. Trump abandoned the nuclear agreement,
**[both sides are talking about the need to negotiate]{.underline}**,
even if each has set out unilateral demands that the other must meet.
There is no guarantee, of course, that both sides will find a way. Mr.
Khamenei has described Mr. Trump as an evil trickster and has prohibited
talks with him under any circumstances. And Gen. Qassem Suleimani, the
commander of the elite Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards who is
rumored to be a future president, has said that talking to Washington
would be like surrender. Mr. Ahmadinejad conceded that for talks to
happen, in his view, the United States would need to soften its
approach. In the past few weeks Iranian media have reported that besides
Mr. Ahmadinejad, at least three prominent conservatives have advocated
talks with the United States, underscoring the divisions in Iran's
hierarchy. Brig. Gen. Hossein Alaei, the former commander of the
Revolutionary Guards joint forces and founder of its navy, said, "We
must use the mechanism of negotiations and should not set aside
talking." He also criticized the decision not to sit down with Mr. Trump
when he offered talks without preconditions. Mojtaba Zonnour, a
conservative cleric and head of Parliament's national security
committee, said that **[the "Islamic Republic is not running away from
talks and the path to talking remains open]{.underline}**," but that it
should take place within the framework of the Iran nuclear deal.
Mohammad Reza Bahonar, a prominent leader of a conservative political
party, said the Islamic Republic had learned in its 40-year history how
to turn "maximum threat from the enemy" into "opportunity." "In the
current ping-pong situation between Islamic Republic and Trump's
craziness, intermediaries have entered and we've had some serious
discussions and prepared several scenarios," Mr. Bahonar said of the
potential for negotiations. In trying to present himself as a political
alternative for Iran, Mr. Ahmadinejad tried in The Times interview to
walk back some of his comments and policies that are considered
incendiary in the West. On Israel's right to exist and a two-state
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he said that he would
accept whatever Palestinians decide in a free election. On the brutal
crackdowns by his government on protesters and dissidents contesting his
re-election in 2009, Mr. Ahmadinejad denounced the clashes and tensions
but said that the other side should have accepted the vote. He contended
it was not his decision to place his political adversaries, the
opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, and
Mehdi Karroubi under house arrest. Some Iran political analysts say Mr.
**[Ahmadinejad's eagerness to talk with a Western news organization
shows that Iranian leaders are pursuing]{.underline}** several policies
simultaneously to see which one works in their standoff with the United
States: escalating tensions, decreasing nuclear commitments and
**[exploring diplomatic routes]{.underline}**. "**[Engagement with Trump
directly is an idea that has gained currency in Iran,"]{.underline}**
said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis
Group. "Not because they think they can get a better and broader
agreement than the J.C.P.O.A., but **[they think it can provide them
with some relief]{.underline}**."

their large-scale arms deals]{.underline}. The truth is exactly the
reverse. The Saudi military is highly dependent on advanced American
weaponry. American F-15s comprise close to half the Saudi fighter force,
and the Saudi variant of the F-15E Strike Eagle represents a substantial
portion of the air force's striking power. On land, the Saudi army is
dependent almost exclusively on American M1 Abrams tanks and Bradley
infantry fighting vehicles. [They can't just waltt over to a different
country and transform their armed forces --- not without suffering
enormous setbacks in readiness and effectiveness during a years-long
transition. A fundamental reality of arms deals is that a major arms
purchase essentially locks the purchasing nation in a dependent posture
for training, spare parts, and technical upgrades.]{.underline} Indeed,
one of the reasons for engaging in an arms transaction --- aside from
the economic benefit --- is that the transaction gives America enormous
power over the national defense of the purchasing nation. You buy our
weapons, and we gain power over you. Well, we gain potential power. The
question is whether we have the will to exercise that power. Moreover,
Trump's claim that the Saudis could simply go to China or Russia betrays
an odd ignorance about Chinese and Russian arms. [Many of their most
advanced weapons aren't quite ready for prime time. If the Saudis are
terrified of Iran, purchasing worse weapons that would require new
training cycles, new spare parts, and new technical relationships is a
terrible option. It's a recipe for a serious military
setback]{.underline}. For example --- as Washington Post columnist Josh
Rogin observes --- the State Department just approved the sale of
Terminal High Altitude Air Defense missile-defense system to the Saudis.
The Saudis are rightfully concerned about Iranian missile attack. Is it
the position of the Trump administration that the Saudis have leverage
over us if they cancel that deal and seek an inferior missile-defense
system from a competing country? As Rogin says, Trump's thinking is
"totally and completely backwards." [Buying a weapons platform is not
like choosing between a Honda Accord and a Toyota Camry --- where if one
dealer ticks you off, you can just walk across the street and
immediately get a substantially similar product. Trump is displaying his
ignorance here, and his surrogates on television (many of whom know
better) are exploiting understandable civic ignorance to push the
administration's line]{.underline}. We can't expect Americans to know
exactly how arms deals work or how F-15s are serviced and upgraded. But
we should expect the president to understand these realities. For all
the president's bluster, he's demonstrating a surprising timidity in the
face of an undeniable provocation from one of our more mendacious
"allies." [We hold the cards in this alliance, and it's time --- for
once --- to stand up to a repressive and brutal regime, even if we do
have a common Iranian foe. The world's strongest nation, with the
world's largest economy, needs Saudi Arabia far less than they need us.
End support for the brutal Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen. Impose
conditions on continued American military cooperation with Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. It's time for the junior partner in this alliance
to finally learn its place.

#### Saudis have no counter-leverage over the US -- they're asymmetrically dependent

**[Wald]{.underline}**, Ellen R. \[Writer for the New York Times\].
"Saudi Arabia Has No Leverage". New York Times, Oct 18,
**[2018]{.underline}**.
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/opinion/saudi-arabiaeconomy-united-states.html

As the fallout continues over the disappearance of the Saudi journalist
Jamal Khashoggi, the government in Riyadh is puting on a tough face. If
there are sanctions over the alleged murder of Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudis
want the world to know, they will fight back. On Sunday, the Saudi
government released a recalcitrant statement: "The Kingdom also affirms
that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action, and
that the Kingdom's economy has an influential and vital role in the
global economy and that the Kingdom's economy is affected only by the
impact of the global economy." These are empty threats. Saudi Arabia is
not in a position to harm the United States. [In fact, when it comes to
relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, Washington has all
of the leverage. American policymakers shouldn't forget
that]{.underline}. One of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's primary
objectives is to diversify the Saudi economy and wean his country off
its dependence on oil. Unemployment in Saudi Arabia is at more than 12
percent, and some 70 percent of employed Saudis work for the government.
[The Saudi labor ministry estimates that the economy needs to create 1.2
million jobs by 2022 to lower unemployment to a still dismal 9 percent.
But because the country lacks business experience and special expertise
outside of the oil and petrochemical industries, that won't be possible
without foreign --- and particularly American --- participation. That's
why the Saudis have been making so many deals recently:]{.underline} The
Public Investment Fund has partnered with AMC to open and run movie
theaters across the country because AMC knows how to manage cinemas.
Saudi Arabia is pursuing deals for Snap and Amazon to open facilities in
the kingdom because they can offer tech opportunities. It's not just the
private sector. [The Saudi government bureaucracy also relies heavily on
American management expertise. Riyadh has been hiring American
consultants since the 1950s, and in recent years American firms like
McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Oliver Wyman have worked on
hundreds of projects for the kingdom.]{.underline} In some cases, Saudi
government bureaucrats work side by side with these consultants to
implement government programs. The Saudi Public Investment Fund --- the
kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, which is estimated to have more than
\$250 billion in assets --- is also closely tied to the American
economy. To name just a few of its major investments: It put \$3.5
billion into Uber in 2016 and almost half a billion dollars in the
start-up Magic Leap this year; it invested \$45 billion in SoftBank's
Vision Fund, which invests heavily in American technology start-ups; and
it made a \$5 billion investment with a possible growth to \$20 billion
in a Blackstone fund for United States infrastructure. Much of the tens
of billions of dollars cannot be pulled out on a whim. These startups
are private companies without open markets for their shares. Prince
Mohammed is building a domestic reputation with this tech portfolio, so
its success is politically important, too. All of this is at risk if the
dispute worsens between Saudi Arabia and the United States over Mr.
Khashoggi's disappearance. Not only could the Saudis not retaliate
because their economy is so intertwined with that of the United States,
but they will also be susceptible to pressure. Targeted sanctions --- if
it comes to that --- could force consultants to withdraw or cut off the
Saudi Public Investment Fund's access to the profits of its investments.
[More likely, though, is that a continuing dispute would force American
businesses like AMC to seriously reconsider involvement in the country
because of negative publicity]{.underline}. What about oil? Whereas
Saudi Arabia could once shock the world economy by cutting oil exports
or production to raise prices, it no longer has that power. [The oil
market today is significantly more diverse than it was in 1973, when
Saudi Arabia and other Arab petroleum exporters unilaterally raised the
price of oil and unsettled the American economy]{.underline}. In fact,
the United States now produces more oil than Saudi Arabia, and imports
make up a smaller percentage of domestically refined crude oil. Saudi
Arabia cannot embargo or unilaterally raise oil prices for the United
States without doing greater harm to its own industry and revenues. If
Riyadh directed the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, to halt exports
to the United States today, it would primarily hurt Aramco itself.
Aramco owns Motiva, the largest refinery in the United States, and
Motiva is more reliant on Saudi oil than any other part of America's
energy ecosystem. If Aramco tried to raise prices by cuĴing oil
production or exports, it would face irate customers in Asia and hurt
its own refineries in China and Korea, too. We do not yet know for
certain what happened to Mr. Khashoggi, but President Trump has now said
that he believes the Saudi journalist is dead and that there was
high-level Saudi government involvement. If the United States determines
that Saudi Arabia is at fault, the Trump administration will have a real
opportunity. [Of course, President Trump has so far indicated that he
doesn't have much interest in holding Saudi Arabia accountable. But with
calls for a response growing louder on Capitol Hill, the White House
should see a strategic opportunity here]{.underline}. The Saudis are
dependent on the United States, and public opinion is increasingly
against them. Already, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has backed out
of a high profile finance conference in Riyadh next week. Mr. Trump
could use this as a chance to pressure Riyadh to come around on some of
his real priorities: the peace deal between the Israelis and the
Palestinians that Jared Kushner is trying to broker; a resolution to the
dispute with Qatar, which hosts a critical American military base;
billions of dollars more in purchases from American industries[. Saudi
Arabia is not in a position to threaten the American economy. In fact,
the kingdom may be overestimating its own economic clout. It would be a
mistake for Riyadh to try to act on its threats against the United
States.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales give the US leverage over the Saudis -- they need us more than we need them -- fully cuĴing ourselves off means we don't have any influence

Yet America's chief executive is proving to be a pitiful negotiator. The
KSA needs America far more than America needs the KSA. So far the
Saudis' supposed \$110 billion weapons buy has yielded little more than
a tenth as much cash. [In any case, the purpose of alliances should be
to enhance U.S. security, not boost arms sales.]{.underline} Riyadh is
going to continue purchasing American weapons for its own reasons,
including security and prestige. [Of course, it could diversify
suppliers, but for logistical reasons the Kingdom has reason to continue
its relationship with the Pentagon. If nothing else the royal regime
needs spare parts and training to maintain its forces. That need will
only grow if Riyadh no longer can count on America to protect it from
its own folly. Commercial sales beyond weapons are even less important
to America's \$20 trillion economy]{.underline}. If MbS is serious about
reforming his nation's energy-dependent and welfare-centered economy, he
is going to deal with American companies. A presidential desire that the
Saudis spend their money to buy products as well as lobbyists and think
tanks is not a good reason to insulate a murderous, irresponsible, and
reckless regime. The administration should stop acting like it is
beholden to MbS. It should not, for instance, press Ankara to go easy on
the Saudis. Reports that the administration is twisting the extradition
process involving Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen as quid pro quo for
Turkish dictator-wannabe Recep Tayyip Erdogan is shocking, if true.
[Moreover, the United States should end all support for the Yemen war.
Weapons sales also should be placed on hold at least until KSA pledges a
behavioral change. This doesn't mean the administration need treat Saudi
Arabia as an enemy and refuse to deal with MbS. After all, American
presidents engaged Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Jong-un. The
United States must operate in a world filled with ugly, brutal, and
authoritarian regimes.]{.underline} In such cases the president's
transactional approach makes some foreign-policy sense. However, there
should be no exaggerated expressions of fervent friendship, no illusions
about shared values, and no attempt to sugarcoat Riyadh's sustained
assault on human rights and American interests. [In particular, the
United States should send a consistent message to King Salman and the
royal family that while Washington recognizes the Saudis will choose
their own leadership, the United States will be forced to look to its
own interests. That means confronting MbS' irresponsible actions, when
necessary. The United States will not overlook the fact that his
aggressive reach for hegemony is destabilizing the region.]{.underline}
From that members of the royal family should draw their own conclusions.
The KSA is not an ally in any real sense, let alone a "truly
spectacular" one. It is an important state in an important region which
must be engaged. The administration should do so, without disguising the
disdain with which it treats a murderous and corrupt absolute monarchy.
Working together when appropriate should never be confused with
endorsing or even accepting such a malodorous regime.

#### US has the ability to influence the Saudis -- our involvement in the coalition means we can pressure them to reduce human rights abuses and come to the negotiating table

keep up support for Saudi-led coalition in Yemen". Reuters, Aug 28,

[The U.S. military signaled on Tuesday it would continue its assistance
to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, even as it acknowledged
U.S. support was not "unconditional" amid mounting concern about the
war's toll on civilians]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia is leading a
Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore
the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu
Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthis
in 2015. The United States and other Western powers provide arms and
intelligence to the alliance. [Human rights groups have criticized them
over coalition air strikes that have killed hundreds of civilians at
hospitals, schools and markets. A Saudi-led coalition air strike that
hit a bus earlier this month killed dozens of children, sparking outrage
from U.N. officials. Saudi Arabia has said it will investigate the
attack.]{.underline} Mattis dispatched a three-star general to Saudi
Arabia after that incident, and told reporters on Tuesday the United
States recognized such mistakes were tragic. But he added: "We haven't
seen any callous disregard by the people we're working with." "[So, we
will continue to work with them, reduce this tragedy," Mattis said. The
Pentagon believes that its assistance, which includes refueling
coalition jets and training in targeting, helps reduce civilian
casualties]{.underline}. In Geneva, U.N. human rights experts said on
Tuesday that air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition in the war have
caused heavy civilian casualties and that some may amount to war crimes.
[The experts' panel also said fighters of the rebel Houthi movement had
fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and shelled the Yemeni city of Taiz.
Saudi woman fleeing family to remain in Thailand "Our conduct there is
to try to keep the human cost of innocents being killed accidentally to
the absolute minimum. That is our goal where we engage with the
coalition," Mattis said. "Our goal is to reduce this tragedy and to get
it to the U.N.- brokered table as quickly as possible." The Yemen war is
seen as a proxy conflict between the region's two main powers: Sunni
Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales give the US leverage -- we have comparatively more control over how weapons are used when we're selling them

https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa836.pdf

THE CASE FOR ARMS SALES Few tools have been used in pursuit of so many
foreign policy objectives as arms sales. The United States has sold
weapons to its NATO allies to ensure their ability to defend Western
Europe; to friendly governments around the world facing insurgencies and
organized crime; to allies in the Pacific (buffering them against
China's rising military power); and to both Israel and many of its Arab
neighbors in efforts to maintain regional stability and influence over
Middle Eastern affairs. [The United States has used arms sales, as well
as the threat of denying arms, in efforts to influence human rights
policies, to help end conflicts, to gain access to military bases, and
to encourage fair elections. Since 9/11, the new central focus of U.S.
weapons sales has been to bolster the global war on
terror.]{.underline}36 Despite their many uses, arms sales impact
foreign affairs through two basic mechanisms. [The first involves using
arms sales to shift the balance of power and capabilities between the
recipient and its neighbors, thereby helping allies win wars or deter
adversaries, promote local and regional stability, or buttress friendly
governments against insurgencies and other internal
challenges]{.underline}.37 During the Cold War, American arms sales
became part of a broader strategy to deter the Soviet Union from
invading Western Europe. [In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United
States sold weapons to Afghanistan and Iraq to bolster their ability to
defeat the Taliban, al Qaeda, and the Islamic State. By selling advanced
weaponry to Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, the United States
hoped to balance rising Chinese power and promote regional
stability.]{.underline} Although the specific objectives differ, at root
the causal mechanism is the same: using arms sales to shift the balance
of power in a direction more favorable to American interests. The size
of the circles indicates the frequency of arms deals struck, not the
quantity or price, and is intended to show which nations have
long-standing buyer-seller relationships with the United States. "Few
tools have been used in pursuit of so many foreign policy objectives as
arms sales." 10 [The second mechanism involves using arms sales to
generate leverage over the conduct of other nations. As the producer of
the world's most advanced and sought-after weaponry, the United States
can dictate, at least to some degree, the conditions under which it will
agree to sell certain weapons]{.underline}.39 As Andrew Shapiro puts it,
"When a country acquires an advanced U.S. defense system, they are not
simply buying a product to enhance their security, they are also seeking
a relationship with the United States. . . . [This engagement helps
build bilateral ties and creates strong incentives for recipient
countries to maintain good relations with the United States."40 American
influence is thought to be most potent in cases where the United States
provides a nation with a large share of its military
capabilities]{.underline}. In the wake of U.S. pressure to halt Israeli
defense exports to China, for example, an Israeli official acknowledged,
"If the United States, which provides Israel with \$2 billion in annual
military aid, demands that we will not sell anything to China---then we
won't. If the Americans decide we should not be selling arms to other
countries as well---Israel will have no choice but to comply."

## Oil DA

#### Stable, high oil prices via the US-Saudi alliance are good -- otherwise Russia's economy collapses

**[Movchan]{.underline}**, Andrey. **[15]{.underline}** \[Senior
associate and director of the Economic Policy Program at the Carnegie
Moscow Center. He is one of Russia's best known financial managers\].
"Just an Oil Company? The True Extent of Russia's Dependency on Oil and
Gas". Carnegie, 2015. http://carnegie.ru/eurasiaoutlook/?fa=61272

[In March 2014, Lindsey Graham, the outspoken U.S. Republican senator
who is now running for president, referred to Russia as merely "an oil
and gas company masquerading as a country." Graham is known for making
alarmist and controversial statements---he recently said that falling
oil prices were the result of a plot by Sunni Arabs against Iran and
Russia---and it would be easy to dismiss this one as yet another
outlandish bid for publicity]{.underline}. Before we quickly dismiss
Graham, however, we should recall the words of Leonardo da Vinci, "We
derive more benefit from having our faults pointed out by our enemies
than from hearing the opinions of friends." Given that the fall in oil
prices appears to be a long-term trend, if Graham is actually right,
Russia is facing an economic crisis the like of which it hasn't seen for
many years. At first glance, it is absurd to call Russia "merely an oil
and gas company." The share of hydrocarbon production in the country's
GDP has not exceeded 26.5 percent for 25 years and the share of oil and
gas export has not risen above 14.5 percent of GDP. [Those who champion
Russia's underlying economic stability point to these very reasonable
numbers. But things aren't quite so simple. Although three quarters of
Russia's official GDP is not pouring out of its oil wells, the country
is still heavily dependent on oil. We also need to identify how the
non-oil components of Russian GDP are financed. A more detailed analysis
is less rosy. Trade accounts for 29 percent of Russian GDP,]{.underline}
but Russia imports about 60 percent of its total consumption and pays
for imports with earnings from exports, which are overwhelmingly
dominated by oil and gas. That means that the share of hydrocarbons in
the GDP is in effect 17.5 percent higher. Next, 20-22 perc ent of GDP is
comprised of state budget expenditures. At least 60 percent of
consolidated budget revenues come from the mineral extraction tax,
excise duties, export duties, value-added tax on imports and other taxes
arbitrable to the oil and gas sector directly or indirectly. This adds
an additional 13 percent to our calculation of the oil-based GDP. By
this rough tally, 57 percent of Russia's GDP already depends on oil. But
we also need to factor in the direct influx of petrodollars that is
converted into investments and spending in other sectors of the economy
and additional consumption. It is hard to put a number on this, but by
various estimates it has ranged between 10 and 13 percent of GDP in
recent years. So our overall figure is now up to 67---70 percent. The
nature of the oil dependence is illustrated in Table 1 by tracking
changes in Russia's consolidated budget revenues against WTI oil prices.
No explanation is needed. Table 2, which compares the rise and fall of
Russia's gold and foreign-exchange reserves with changes in oil prices,
paints exactly the same picture. And, as Table 3 shows, if we take
Russia's dollar denominated GDP growth rates and track them against
changes in oil prices, the curves again practically coincide. This begs
the question: What are the effects of this dependence? An indirect
answer can be found by measuring Russia's GDP in terms of barrels of
oil. In 1992, when Russia was almost at the boĴom of a structural
crisis, its non-oil GDP (GDP minus actual production of oil) was
equivalent to 19.5 billion barrels of oil in 1992 prices. In 1999, when
oil prices were at their lowest, Russia's non-oil GDP dipped below the
equivalent of eight billion barrels. However, even today, in 2015,
Russia's non-oil GDP is still only worth 16.7 billion barrels in current
prices (see Table 4). During the same period, Poland's non-oil GDP
increased by 37 percent, while Norway, which has almost halved its oil
production in the last 25 years, has maintained its non-oil GDP
calculated in barrels of oil at the same level (see Table 5). Even the
ruble, it transpires, is ruled by the world oil market, not the Central
Bank. [When the oil price is above 60 U.S dollars a barrel, the real
ruble exchange rate is higher than the inflation-adjusted exchange rate.
When the oil price is below 60 dollars, the ruble is cheaper (see Table
6). The oil price is currently below 60 dollars, so the ruble has caught
up with its inflation rate for the first time since 2005 and the value
of dollar measured in rubles is rising above the "inflation curve."
Furthermore, the extent of the ruble's deviation from its theoretical
value, based on historical inflation, can be determined almost exactly
by the oil price. (See Table 7). Official statistics suggest that
Russia's oil and gas industry accounts for only a quarter of the
country's GDP. However, when other factors are factored in, the economy
is seen to be much more heavily dependent on hydrocarbons. With oil
prices looking set to stay low for a long time, this is bad news for the
Russian economy. This time at least, it turns out that Senator Graham
got it right.]{.underline} The health of Russia's economy depends not on
domestic policies, sanctions, technological innovations, the decision to
seek rapprochement with the West or friendship with China. The only
factor that influences Russia's economy is the price of oil and gas.
There is more bad news. The fall in world oil prices is not, as Graham
believes, a plot by Sunni Arabs. The world oil supply exceeded 95
million barrels per day (mbpd) at the end of 2014, while demand
plateaued at 93 mbpd. The trend looks set to continue. Over the last
five years, the increase in oil supply in percentage points has outpaced
demand by a factor of almost two. All indicators suggest that we are at
the start of a long phase of low oil prices. By the end of this period,
the oil industry will encounter beĴer solar panels and super-batteries,
more efficient car and aircraft engines, a mass market for electric
vehicles, more energy-efficient construction materials, and other
innovations.

oil-and-gas/

[Yet doing nothing in the face of lower oil and gas revenues also
carries enormous social and political risks. These include diminution,
in real terms, of the already very modest expenditures on health care
and education.]{.underline} With an effectively bankrupt state pension
fund and a rapidly aging population, the Kremlin's ability to prevent a
full-blown pension crisis will require a huge influx of gold and hard
currency reserves. [At a time when soaring household utility prices
(tariffs) are a leading source of dissatisfaction with the regime,\[73\]
the diminishing energy revenues will endanger the regime's ability to
subsidize the costs. "Doing nothing in the face of lower oil and gas
revenues also carries enormous social and political risks."Similarly,
smaller subsidies would also mean still-greater volatility in the North
Caucasus, much of which is in the throes of a low intensity
fundamentalist uprising and plagued by unemployment, especially among
young males]{.underline}. In Chechnya, Russia for years has placated its
dictator, Ramzan Kadyrov, with subsidies amounting to roughly 90 percent
of the republic's budget, and no one can predict how Kadyrov will react
when the flow of cash begins to dry up.\[74\] [Finally, among the most
destabilizing consequences of the continuing dependence on oil and gas
will be the Kremlin's declining ability to secure the elites' loyalty.
Fiercely protective of their share of the politically apportioned riches
of Russia's state capitalism, powerful clans will squabble to secure the
same share of a diminishing pie, in the process threatening the
stability of the regime]{.underline}. "Putin's unchallenged power" rests
on a tripartite foundation: "oil and gas money, the Federal Security
Service, and television," a Russian observer noted last December.\[75\]
Today, one leg of this tripod is beginning to look wobbly. [These may
not be the challenges of tomorrow or the day after. Yet in the medium
term and longer term, trends in technology and the global economy, as
well as the country's own economic, social, political, and
demographic.]{.underline}

#### Virulent nationalism, victimhood narratives, and hair-trigger nuclear arsenal mean risk of war is high if Russia faces a prolonged recession

Biggest Threat To America In 2015". Forbes, 2015.

[So don't be surprised if the economic sanctions Washington has led the
West in imposing on Russia look like a bad idea a year from now. At the
moment, a combination of sanctions and plummeting oil prices seems to be
dealing the government of President Vladimir Putin a heavy blow --- just
retribution, many say, for its invasion of Ukraine and annexation of
Crimea last year. But as Alan Cullison observed in the Wall Street
Journal this week, sanctions sometimes provoke precisely the opposite
response from what policymakers hope]{.underline}. In Russia's case,
that could mean a threat to America's survival. Let's briefly consider
how Russia's current circumstances could lead to dangers that dwarf the
challenges posed by ISIS and cyber attacks. A paranoid political
culture. Russia's moves on Ukraine look to many Westerners like a
straightforward case of aggression. That is not the way they look to
Vladimir Putin's inner circle of advisors in Moscow, nor to most
Russians. [That inner circle is drawn mainly from the Russian security
services --- Putin himself spent 16 years in the KGB --- and to them the
revolution in Ukraine was a U.S.-backed coup aimed at weakening Russia.
Putin describes the Crimea as a birthplace of Russian culture, and his
government has repeatedly warned against the expansion of Western
economic and political influence into a region historically regarded as
Moscow's sphere of influence. Putin relies heavily on the Kremlin
bureaucracy to provide him with intelligence (he avoids the Internet),
so his briefings tend to reinforce the view that Moscow was forced to
intervene in Ukraine by Western subversion aimed at undermining his
rule]{.underline}. A nuclear arsenal on hair trigger. Between the two of
them, Russia and America control over 90% of the world's nuclear
weapons. However, Moscow is far more dependent on its nuclear arsenal
for security, because it cannot afford to keep up with U.S. investments
in new warfighting technology. So Russian military doctrine states that
it might be necessary to use nuclear weapons to combat conventional
attacks from the West. Many Russians think that attacks on their country
are a real possibility, and that their nuclear deterrent --- which
consists mainly of silo-based missiles in known locations --- might have
to be launched quickly to escape a preemptive strike. Moscow staged a
major nuclear exercise during last year's Ukraine crisis in which it
assumed missiles would have to be launched fast on warning of a Western
attack[. A senior Russian officer has stated that 96% of the strategic
rocket force can be launched within minutes. A collapsing economy. Much
of Putin's popularity within Russia is traceable to the impressive
recovery of the post-Soviet economy on his watch. Since he came to power
in 2001, the country's gross domestic product has grown sixfold, greatly
increasing the size and affluence of the Russian middle class. But that
growth has been based in large part on the export of oil and gas to
neighboring countries at a time when energy prices reached record
highs.]{.underline} Now the price of oil has fallen at the same time
that economic sanctions are beginning to bite. The ruble lost nearly
half its value against the dollar last year, and the economy has begun
to shrink. Putin blames sanctions for 25-30% of current economic
hardships. Many Westerns believe a prolonged recession would weaken
Putin's support, but because he can blame outsiders, economic troubles
might actually strengthen his hand and accelerate the trend toward
authoritarian rule. A deep sense of grievance. Blaming outsiders for
domestic troubles has a long pedigree in Russian political tradition,
and it feeds into a deep-seated sense that Russia has been deprived of
its rightful role in the world by the U.S. and other Western powers.
Russia may have little past experience with democracy, but it was a
major power for centuries prior to the collapse of communism. Like
authoritarian rulers in other nations[, Putin has built his political
base by appealing to nationalism, fashioning a revisionist view of
recent events in which Russia is the victim rather that the author of
its own misfortunes. He has called the break-up of the Soviet Union a
tragedy of epic proportions, and apparently really believes it. By
tapping into a deep vein of resentment in Russian political culture,
Putin has created a broad constituency for standing up to outsiders even
if it means prolonged economic hardship and the danger of
war.]{.underline} A vulnerable antagonist. Federal Reserve chair Janet
Yellen says [America faces little danger from Russia's current troubles,
but that's because she thinks in economic terms. In a broader sense,
America potentially is in great danger because Putin and his advisors
really believe they are the target of a Western plot to weaken their
country. The biggest concern is that some new move by Russia along its
borders degenerates into a crisis where Moscow thinks it can improve its
tactical situation by threatening local use of nuclear weapons, and then
the crisis escalates.]{.underline} At that point U.S. policymakers would
have to face the reality that (1) they are unwilling to fight Russia to
protect places like Ukraine, and (2) they have no real defenses of the
American homeland against a sizable nuclear attack. In other words, the
only reason Washington seems to have the upper hand right now is because
it assumes leaders in Moscow will act "rationally." The unspoken wisdom
in Washington today is that if nobody gives voice to such fears, then
they don't need to be addressed. That's how a peaceful world stumbled
into the First World War a century ago --- by not acknowledging the
worst-case potential of a crisis in Eastern Europe --- and the blindness
of leaders back then explains most of what went wrong later in the 20th
Century. If we want to avoid the risk of reliving that multi-generation
lesson, then [U.S. policymakers need to do something more than simply
wait for Putin to crack. That day will never come. In the near term,
Washington needs to work harder to defuse tensions, including taking a
more serious look at the history that led to Moscow's move on Crimea.
Over the longer term, Washington needs to get beyond its dangerous
aversion to building real defenses against long-range nuclear weapons,
because it is just a matter of time before some dictator calls America's
bluff.]{.underline}

Avert a Nuclear War". Carnegie, 2015.
http://carnegie.ru/2015/04/19/how-to-avert-nuclearwar/i7g2

[We find ourselves in an increasingly risky strategic environment. The
Ukrainian crisis has threatened the stability of relations between
Russia and the West, including the nuclear dimension --- as became
apparent last month when it was reported that Russian defense officials
had advised President Vladimir V. Putin to consider placing Russia's
nuclear arsenal on alert during last year's crisis in
Crimea.]{.underline} Diplomatic efforts have done little to ease the new
nuclear tension. This makes it all the more critical for Russia and the
United States to talk, to relieve the pressures to "use or lose" nuclear
forces during a crisis and minimize the risk of a mistaken launch. [The
fact is that we are still living with the nuclear-strike doctrine of the
Cold War, which dictated three strategic options: first strike, launch
on warning and post-attack retaliation. There is no reason to believe
that Russia and the United States have discarded these options, as long
as the architecture of "mutually assured destruction" remains intact.
For either side, the decision to launch on warning --- in an attempt to
fire one's nuclear missiles before they are destroyed --- would be made
on the basis of information from early-warning satellites and ground
radar.]{.underline} Given the 15to 30-minute flight times of strategic
missiles, a decision to launch after an alert of an apparent attack must
be made in minutes. [This is therefore the riskiest scenario, since
provocations or malfunctions can trigger a global
catastrophe.]{.underline} Since computer-based information systems have
been in place, the likelihood of such errors has been minimized. But the
emergence of cyberwarfare threats has increased the potential for false
alerts in early-warning systems. [The possibility of an error cannot be
ruled out. American officials have usually played down the
launch-on-warning option. They have argued instead for the advantages of
post-attack retaliation, which would allow more time to analyze the
situation and make an intelligent decision.]{.underline} Neither the
Soviet Union nor Russia ever stated explicitly that it would pursue a
similar strategy, but an emphasis on mobile missile launchers and
strategic submarines continues to imply a similar reliance on an ability
to absorb an attack and carry out retaliatory strikes. Today, however,
Russia's early warning system is compromised. [The last of the
satellites that would have detected missile launches from American
territory and submarines in the past stopped functioning last fall. This
has raised questions about Russia's very ability to carry out
launch-on-warning attacks. Partly to compensate for the loss of its
space-based system, Russia has deployed prefabricated radar units that
can be set up quickly along its borders.]{.underline} Some of these are
already operational; some are still being tested. Unlike satellite
networks, radar can provide accurate information about the scale and
targeting of a missile attack --- but only once a missile has entered
its vicinity, which would most likely be 10 to 15 minutes after launch.
[The upside of radar reporting is more information. The downside of
having to wait is that it cuts the time for deciding whether to launch
on warning. That in turn increases the likelihood of mistaken
retaliation. For a submarine missile fired from the Norwegian Sea,
Russia's radar network would give its nuclear decision makers just 10
minutes to respond. America's early warning systems can be expected to
provide about twice as much time. Clearly, for either side, these
timelines are very compressed and the opportunities for ill-considered
decisions very real. Launch-on-warning puts enormous strain on the
nuclear chains of command in both countries.]{.underline} In theory, no
sensible head of state would authorize a launch-on-warning strike after
receiving information that just one missile, or a small number of
missiles, were inbound, on the assumption that this was not an
intentional, full-scale attack. But the launch-on-warning doctrine still
rules in both Russia and the United States --- in which case the risk,
however small, of cataclysmic error remains. This risk should motivate
the presidents of Russia and the United States to decide in tandem to
eliminate the launch-on-warning concept from their nuclear strategies.
They should reinstitute military-to-military talks, which were suspended
over the Ukraine crisis, to pursue this stand-down as an urgent
priority. (A joint decision on this would not destabilize nuclear
deterrence[: Both countries still have nuclear forces designed to
withstand a first-strike attack, guaranteeing retaliatory strikes.) To
reinforce this accord, both countries should refrain from conducting
military exercises that involve practicing missile launches based on
information from early warning systems. Even if this restraint cannot
yet be fully verified, it would be a valuable contribution to strategic
stability --- and, of course, to preventing an inadvertent nuclear
war.]{.underline} This would be a positive step ahead of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference that the United Nations will
host later this month. Detailed verification measures can come later,
once better Russian-American relations are restored. The technical
implementation of a decision to abandon the launch-on-warning concept
would fall within the framework of the New Start treaty. A phased
reduction of the combat readiness of the strategic nuclear forces would
provide a safer time buffer for nuclear decision making. In periods of
heightened tensions and reduced decision times, the likelihood of human
and technical error in control systems increases. Launch-on-warning is a
relic of Cold War strategy whose risk today far exceeds its value. Our
leaders urgently need to talk and, we hope, agree to scrap this obsolete
protocol before a devastating error occurs.

#### Even if Russian economic collapse doesn't go nuclear, empirics prove economic decline causes conventional war

**[Royal,]{.underline}** Jedediah. **[10]{.underline}** \[Director of
Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense\].
"Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic
Crises," in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political
Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215, 2010

[Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the
likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has
contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic
decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent
states]{.underline}. Research in this vein has been considered at
systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions
follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski
and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that
rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a
pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent
leader to the next. [As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises
could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin.
1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the
risk of miscalculation (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively
certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment
for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power
(Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global
economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the
likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he
suggests that the causes and connections between global economic
conditions and security conditions remain unknown]{.underline}. Second,
on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations
suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in
understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. [He
argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits
from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade
relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline,
particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources,
the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use
force to gain access to those resources.]{.underline} Crises could
potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on
its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent
states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline
and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess
(2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external
conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write:
The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are
strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn
internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the
presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which
international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other.
(Blomberg & Hess, 2002. p. 89) [Economic decline has also been linked
with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, &
Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and
lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the
popularity of a sitting government. "Diversionary theory" suggests that,
when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting
governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military
conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect]{.underline}. Wang
(1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find
supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are
at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and
Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards
diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic
states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more
susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic
support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of
weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak
[Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the
use of force. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively
correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of
economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic
decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5
This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict
has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and
deserves more attention.]{.underline}

### Iran Deterrence

#### Trump's support of MBS after Khashoggi's killing proves the alliance is fine in the status quo -- the alliance is good, it stops Iran's advances and reduces terrorism

journalist for Vox News\]. "Trump's Saudi Arabia decision is the perfect
distillation of his worldview". Vox, Nov 21, 2018.
https://www.vox.com/world/2018/11/21/18106388/trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggistatement-foreign-policy)

[The problem is MBS did know, according to Trump's own CIA.]{.underline}
But the president hasn't trusted America's intelligence agencies since
the start, namely, decrying a January 2017 assessment saying Russia
tried to influence the 2016 presidential election. He's even defended
Russian President Vladimir Putin's blanket denial of involvement in the
Kremlin-ordered influence campaign. "The president's decision to support
the Saudi regime's horrific actions is yet another example of how he
preferences authoritarians over all others, including his own
intelligence agency," Mara Karlin, a former top Pentagon strategist now
at Johns Hopkins University, told me. There's a cold logic, however, to
Trump's decision. [The decades-long alliance with Saudi Arabia has
tangible benefits to the US, particularly in the Middle East, including
pushing back against Iran and cooperation on terrorism. There's an
argument that these interests are too valuable to throw away in a spat
over the death of one journalist, even though he was a US resident.
Trump may already feel he's done enough after sanctioning 17 Saudis last
week, each --- including a top MBS aide --- allegedly connected to the
Khashoggi murder.]{.underline}

Geopolitical consequences. [Saudi-Russian gas cooperation is also a
brilliant move for Riyadh on numerous fronts. First, it strengthens
ongoing bilateral ties between Riyadh and Russia, while also helping the
kingdom diversify its international investments]{.underline}. It will
also help it move away from oil export revenue reliance. If the Saudis
intend to also sign long term off-take agreements with Arctic LNG, it
will help the kingdom's energy planners use gas to replace oil in its
electric power generation sector. The de facto OPEC leader burns an
average of 700,000 bpd of oil for electricity to keep the population
cool in the hottest summer months from May to August, official figures
showed. [As more oil used for power generation is displaced with gas, it
becomes available for export, albeit without the kingdom having to
increase production or in times of a market crisis tapping into its
questionable spare production capacity. The move for Russia is also just
as beneficial as Moscow seeks ways to offset restrictive U.S. sanctions
on its energy sector]{.underline}. Also, stronger bilateral ties between
Riyadh and Moscow could create a wedge between the U.S. and Saudi
Arabia, particularly in times of crisis between the two sides, including
the current roil over the killing of prominent Saudi journalist and U.S.
resident Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey at the beginning of the month. The
danger for Washington is manifold. [If the U.S., particularly a growing
and assertive anti-Saudi sentiment in both the Senate and House, force
President Trump's hand over harsher rhetoric and possibly economic
sanctions against the Saudis, this will give Moscow considerable
leverage. Though Trump has insisted that he wants to safeguard billions
of dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, if indeed those arms sales
were halted, Russian could easily fill the void with its own military
hardware sales.]{.underline}

## Case

### Arms Key

#### Arms sales are key to relations and the alliance -- cutting them off removes our best counterterrorism partner in the region

**[Ryan,]{.underline}** Missy **[18]{.underline}**. \[Reporter for the
Washington Post\]. "As crisis intensifies, what's at stake in America's
military partnership with Saudi Arabia?". Washington Post, Oct 12, 2018.

[International concern over Saudi Arabia's suspected role in the
disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist has threatened to disrupt
one of the United States' most important security
partnerships.]{.underline} Reports that Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington
Post columnist and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was
killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul this month have sparked a wave
of criticism of the kingdom and questions about whether President Trump
and his top aides have emboldened the young royal. [While the Trump
administration has reacted cautiously to reports that Saudi Arabia is
responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance, lawmakers have demanded a
strong U.S. response, potentially including steps to curtail arms sales
or affect other aspects of U.S. defense ties with the
kingdom]{.underline}. On Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called
for a broad halt to military cooperation if Saudi responsibility is
established, adding her voice to a growing roster of lawmakers linking
security ties to Khashoggi's fate. "[Saudi Arabia was once one of our
closest allies in the Middle East," Feinstein said in a statement. "I
think now is the time to reevaluate that relationship." Some lawmakers
have called for sanctions or suspension of military aid to the kingdom's
war in neighboring Yemen.]{.underline} Others have said there may be
"hell to pay," as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) put it this week, if
the kingdom is found responsible. But Trump, who has made the Saudi
monarchy his premier Arab ally, waved off those demands, telling
reporters that cutting off sales to the world's largest buyer of U.S.
weaponry "would not be acceptable to me." "[If we don't sell it to them,
they'll say, 'Well, thank you very much. We'll buy it from Russia.' Or
'Thank you very much. We'll buy it from China,' "]{.underline} Trump
said. "[That doesn't help us --- not when it comes to jobs and not when
it comes to our companies losing out on that work." \[Trump reluctant to
curb arms sales to Saudi Arabia in response to missing
journalist\]]{.underline} The president's comments may say as much about
his transactional view of foreign relationships, elevating economic
concerns over human rights, as they do about the centrality of arms
sales to the two countries' defense relationship. [For decades Saudi
Arabia has been an important American military partner in the Arab
world, where its status as the home to Islam's holiest sites boosts its
leadership credentials. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in
the United States, the kingdom has played a critical role in U.S.
counterterrorism efforts, supplying the government with valuable
intelligence about extremist threats]{.underline}. Most significantly,
Saudi Arabia has used petrodollars to build up the Arab world's most
sophisticated military arsenal. [With one of the world's largest
military budgets, the kingdom boasts a large fleet of F-15 and Tornado
fighter jets, Apache helicopters and other advanced aircraft. About
\$14.5 billion in major sales have been concluded with Saudi Arabia
since Trump became president, but much or all of that was initiated
before he took office. The potential for a shut-off to the lucrative
arms pipeline has alarmed the defense industry. The sales are even more
significant for the administration because, unlike Israel and Egypt,
Saudi Arabia uses its own money rather than U.S. aid to finance arms
purchases. Although Congress has the power to broadly halt arms sales or
suspend military aid, lawmakers have so far declined to do
so.]{.underline} The Obama administration, frustrated by Saudi attacks
on civilian sites in Yemen, temporarily halted sales of precision
munitions in 2016, but Trump reversed that move after taking office. For
Saudi Arabia, the race to arm itself has been aimed not just at boosting
its fighting power but also deepening political ties with producer
nations like the United States. The favor those sales have curried was
starkly visible in Trump's Oval Office comments this week.

#### Arms sales have been the bedrock of the entire alliance for 75 years

[It's a cold financial calculation: Saudi money for U.S.-made weaponry
results in American jobs.]{.underline} This is President Donald Trump's
rationale in dismissing calls in Congress to halt future arms sales to
Saudi Arabia following the mysterious disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi,
the Saudi journalist and American resident. "I don't like the concept of
stopping an investment of \$110 billion into the United States," Trump
said last week. "All they're going to do is say, 'That's OK. [We don't
have to buy it from Boeing. We don't have to buy it from Lockheed. We
don't have to buy it from Raytheon and all these great companies. We'll
buy it from Russia. We'll buy it from China," he said. The 75-year
alliance between the two nations has been built on a simple arrangement:
American demand for Saudi oil and Saudi demand for American
firepower.]{.underline}

### Relations

#### Saudi arms sales solves a laundry list of impacts in the middle east -- nuclear proliferation, stability, energy interests, and creating reliable US allies are only a few examples

**[CFR]{.underline}**., 9-24-20**[10]{.underline}**, \"Is Big Saudi Arms
Sale a Good Idea?,\" Council on Foreign Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea

Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have recently ordered U.S. weapons
worth around \$123 billion. The largest deal, if approved by Congress,
would be a \$60 billion package of U.S. arms for Saudi Arabia, including
eighty-four new and seventy refurbished F-15 fighters, supplied largely
by Boeing, as well as seventy Apache helicopters, seventy-two Black
Hawks, and thirty-six Little Birds. Is the deal a good idea for the
United States and the Middle East? Three of four experts contributing to
this CFR.org roundup basically thought so. Anthony Cordesman argues that
**[arms sales makes sense in terms of U.S. oil interests, the U.S. need
for an ally in the region that can ease the burden on the U.S. military,
and helping to stop a nuclear arms race in the region.]{.underline}**
Loren Thompson and F. Gregory Gause III said the **[Saudis will buy arms
elsewhere if the United States refuses to move forward on the
sale.]{.underline}** Thompson notes the package carefully balances Saudi
requirements and Israeli fears, and Gause suggests that even if the sale
doesn't create long-term stability in the region, **[there's likely to
be some foreign policy benefit for the United States and for the
Saudis]{.underline}**. William Hartung sounded a cautionary note,
warning the deal could spur a regional arms race. Anthony H. Cordesman,
Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at Center for Strategic and
International Studies **[The United States shares critical strategic
interests with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** that shape the proposed Saudi
arms sale. First, for all the talk of energy independence over the last
four decades, **[the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the United
States will be as strategically dependent on imported oil through 2035
as it is today. These projections do not even take account of our
indirect imports of oil in the form of manufactured goods, or our
dependence on the health of a global economy that requires stable
supply- and market-driven prices. The stability of Gulf energy exports
is critical to our economy and every job in the United
States]{.underline}** Second, U.S. military power is finite, and both
the United States and Saudi Arabia face rapidly changing threats. **[The
United States needs allies that have interoperable forces that can both
fight effectively alongside the United States and ease the U.S. burden
by defending themselves. Iran already poses a massive asymmetric
naval-air-assault force threat to the Gulf states.]{.underline}** The
U.S. invasion of Iraq has left Iraqi forces a decade away from being a
counterbalance to Iran; **[Saudi Arabia is the only meaningful regional
power to work with]{.underline}**. Additionally, al-Qaeda in the
peninsula is based in Yemen, and the threat of terrorism and outside
infiltration means **[highly mobile Saudi forces are critical to the
security of Saudi energy and civil facilities. Helping Saudi Arabia
create a combination of effective air and naval power also helps ensure
the security of tanker and other shipping in the Gulf of Oman and a
steadily more unstable Red Sea.]{.underline}** \"The United States needs
allies that have interoperable forces that can both fight effectively
alongside the United States and ease the U.S. burden by defending
themselves.\" Third, **[Iran already poses a missile and chemical
weapons threat and may pose a nuclear one within the next three to five
years. Upgrades of the Saudi Patriots create a base for an integrated
approach to air and missile defense. They lay the groundwork for
follow-on sales of advanced missile defense systems like THAAD, and an
emphasis on defense]{.underline}** (not Saudi purchases of missiles or
nuclear systems). **[Coupled with recent U.S. offers of \"extended
regional deterrence\" and the creation of a Saudi Air Force that is more
of a threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles are to Saudi
Arabia, they offer the best hope of both giving Saudi Arabia and other
Gulf states security and stopping a nuclear arms race in the
region.]{.underline}** Fourth, **[the proposed arms sale package creates
a level of interdependence that gives both the current Saudi government
as well as Saudi governments for the next fifteen to twenty years a
strong incentive to work with the United States]{.underline}**. Saudi
Arabia will need continuing support from the United States during the
entire lifecycle of every major system sold, and no future Saudi
government can ignore this fact. Moreover, the sales are large in dollar
terms, but not in terms of numbers of weapons. This will not be some
kind of massive build-up. Saudi Arabia had an air force with some 417
combat aircraft in 2000, and it now has only 219. The Saudi F-15 buy
will not even restore the force to 2000 numbers. It will take some three
to five years to deliver and put fully in service, replace some
eighty-seven obsolete F-5A/Bs and F-5EIIs that were in service in 2000,
and help Saudi Arabia compensate for the serious performance limits on
107 aging Tornados still in service. William Hartung, Director of the
Arms and Security Initiative, New America Foundation On the face of it,
the proposed arms deal with Saudi Arabia is a win-win situation: **[The
United States gets jobs at a time of high unemployment; Saudi Arabia
gets to bolster its military and further cement its relationship with
its main protector; and Israel gets the promise of equipment superior to
anything transferred to the Saudis. Best of all, say the deal's
advocates, it sends a signal to Iran that the United States and its
Persian Gulf allies will not be intimidated]{.underline}**. Or so it
would seem. But the reality is much more complicated. First, to the
extent that the deal is about jobs, as Boeing and the Obama
administration claim, that is the wrong criterion for making a major
arms sale. Security considerations must come first. And on this front,
there are serious questions that have not been addressed by the boosters
of the deal. By throwing weapons at Saudi Arabia with one hand while
giving them to Israel with the other, are we not simply arming both
sides of a nascent arms race? Is Iran likely to be cowed by the Saudi
mega-deal, or will it simply seek a way to ratchet up its own military
capabilities? \"Congress and the public should think twice before
signing off on what may be the first stage of a new Mideast arms race.\"
Is the Middle East really suffering from a dearth of advanced weaponry?
In the past three years alone, the United States has offered over \$30
billion in armaments to Persian Gulf states, counterbalanced by offers
of a similar amount to Israel. The United Kingdom and Russia have
supplied billions more to the Persian Gulf states. Attempting to create
a balance at higher and higher levels of weaponry is both dangerous and
unnecessary. In addition, how stable is Saudi Arabia? In the short run,
there may be no major cause for concern, but the combat planes,
helicopters, missiles, and bombs that are part of the deal will last for
decades. Would anyone have predicted in the mid-1970s that the heavily
armed regime of the Shah of Iran would be toppled by a group of Islamic
fundamentalists? The Saudi deal will no doubt go through, but it
shouldn't. It consists primarily of offensive weapons\--fighter planes,
attack helicopters, and guided bombs\--that serve no constructive
purpose. Fighter planes and guided bombs aren't relevant to addressing
the potential threat posed by Iranian missiles, nor are they likely to
dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Combat aircraft and
attack helicopters might be used in Saudi strikes against terrorists and
separatist groups in northern Yemen, but doing so would be
counterproductive, more likely to inflame passions against Riyadh than
to solve its border security problems. Congress and the public should
think twice before signing off on what may be the first stage of a new
Mideast arms race. Loren Thompson, Chief Operating Officer, Lexington
Institute Congress will closely scrutinize the proposed arms deal with
Saudi Arabia to make sure it does not threaten Israel or otherwise
destabilize the region. The package appears to be a careful
reconciliation of Saudi requirements with Israeli fears, while also
offering a strategic balance against Iran. **[The biggest component of
the transaction involves new and refurbished F-15 fighters, which are
designed for both air dominance and attack of ground
targets]{.underline}**. [The fighter sale could have been a serious
problem for Israel if Saudi Arabia had been offered stealthy F-22s or
F-35s, because those aircraft would have been suitable for executing a
surprise attack. The F-15 is not stealthy, and although its movements
can be masked through the skillful application of tactics and
electronic-warfare technology, Israeli defenders should have no
difficulty detecting any threatening moves.]{.underline} \"I see little
danger to Israel in the proposed transaction. **[For
Iran]{.underline}**, though, **[the transaction presents a powerful
deterrent since there is nothing in Teheran's current arsenal that can
cope with the latest versions of the F-15 fighter or the AH-64 attack
helicopter]{.underline}**.\" [The helicopters included in the package
are among the most capable in the world, but they could be easily
repulsed by Israeli tactical aircraft if ever dispatched against the
Jewish state. Thus, I see little danger to Israel in the proposed
transaction. **The radical Shiite regime in Iran constitutes the most
serious military threat to Saudi Arabia, so I expect that the pending
arms sale will be followed by additional agreements to modernize the
Saudi Eastern Fleet in the Gulf and upgrade missile
defenses**]{.underline}. [If Congress delays or modifies the proposed
transaction, the Saudi government will probably move to purchase modern
weapons from other sources such as Britain or France]{.underline}. The
kingdom needs to replace its aging Cold War arsenal, and it is
surrounded by nations potentially posing a threat to its security[**.
Little purpose would be served by declining to assist Saudi Arabia in
meeting its legitimate defensive needs.** Whatever the differences may
be between our governments and cultures,]{.underline} **[the Saudis have
been reliable allies of America for decades and have exercised a
moderating influence on the behavior of other oil-producing states.
Helping them means helping ourselves.]{.underline}** F. Gregory Gause
III, Professor and chair of political science department, University of
Vermont The Saudi arms sale will not buy much security in the long run
in the Persian Gulf. But there are no good reasons not to sell the
Saudis those weapons, and **[there are some potentially positive results
(besides the economic benefits to the U.S.) that might come from the
sale\--most importantly U.S. leverage on Riyadh on nuclear proliferation
issues.]{.underline}** The Iranian regional challenge is based on the
political and ideological links with important state and sub-state
actors in the region: Hezbollah, Hamas, various Iraqi parties, the
Syrian regime, and Shia activists in the Gulf monarchies. Better fighter
jets and attack helicopters will not help the Saudis to contain or roll
back this kind of Iranian ideological influence. Still, one good reason
to move ahead with the sale is that there is no good reason not to.
Though some might oppose it on grounds of disliking the Saudi political
system, selling or not selling the arms is not going to affect Saudi
policies on democracy, women, Islam, or anything else one whit. Moral
purity would be purchased at the price of reduced American regional
influence. If the arms sale could destabilize the Saudi regime, that
would be a reason not to do it. Many think that U.S. arms sales to the
Shah \[of Iran\] in the 1970s helped to bring him down, but arms were
part of the larger strategic relationship, to which many Iranians
objected; the arms themselves did not cause the relationship or the
popular reaction against it. **[The Saudis and the United States
are]{.underline}** similarly **[tied together in the eyes of Saudi
citizens and others in the region. But this arms sale would not change
that perception.]{.underline}** The larger issue is whether we are
selling arms to a stable regime in Riyadh. The short answer is \"yes.\"
Also, **[there are two positive foreign policy consequences that could
come from the sale. Its psychological effect could give the Saudis more
credibility with regional elites in their contest for influence with
Iran, making potential Saudi allies in places like Lebanon, Palestine,
Iraq, and Yemen more confident in throwing in their lot with Riyadh. And
if Iran obtains a nuclear weapons capability, the Saudis would
undoubtedly consider the option of proliferating themselves. If they are
confident of their American security guarantee\--and these big arms
sales are warrants of the American commitment to their
security\--American advice not to obtain nuclear weapons will carry more
weight.]{.underline}** In the end, [the Saudis are going to buy weapons.
If we do not sell them, Moscow, London, Paris, and Beijing
will.]{.underline}

#### Bill to end US support of the Saudis in Yemen will pass now that Dems control the House -- proves the tide is shifting towards conditions, pressure, and using arms sales as leverage

Withdraw Support for Saudi War in Yemen in Rebuke to Trump". National
Review, Dec 13, 2018.
https://www.nationalreview.com/news/senate-votes-to-withdraw-support-for-saudiwar-in-yemen-in-rebuke-to-trump/

[The Senate passed a resolution Thursday withdrawing congressional
support for the continued U.S. backing of a Saudi-led coalition's
ongoing proxy war against Iranian funded rebel forces in Yemen, in a
strong rebuke to the Trump administration]{.underline}. A bipartisan
coalition of Senators, motivated largely by opposition to Saudi Arabia's
extrajudicial killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul two and
a half months ago, voted 56--41 to end U.S. support for the civil war
between Houthi rebels and government forces that has precipitated a
massive humanitarian crisis. [The resolution, which for the first time
in history required the Senate to utilize the authority delegated to it
by the War Powers Act of 1973, prohibits the continued U.S. refueling of
Saudi airplanes and scales down the number of supporting American forces
in the region. "It's important to send a message," said Senator Bernie
Sanders of Vermont, who sponsored the bill along with Republican Mike
Lee of Utah, before the vote. "]{.underline}My very strong expectation
is that in January, with Democratic control over the House, it will
succeed," Sanders added, referring to the resolution's prospects for
passing the lower chamber next year.

#### The alliance is good -- it creates jobs, helps counterterrorism, checks Iran, and solves Israel-Palestine

[When President Trump talks about the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia,
he rarely mentions any Saudi role in achieving his stated objectives in
the Middle East --- bringing Iran to heel, forging an
Israeli-Palestinian peace, and vanquishing Islamist terrorism. Instead,
he mostly talks about how much money the Saudis are spending here. "They
give us a lot of jobs. They give us a lot of business,"]{.underline}
Trump said Saturday when asked about the CIA's conclusion that Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi leader, had ordered the
killing of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. "They have truly
been a spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development," he
said, referring primarily to Saudi arms purchases. "You know, I'm
president; I have to take a lot of things into consideration." Trump may
not be focused on counterterrorism cooperation and support for U.S.
strategic aims in the region --- [the basis of the U.S.-Saudi
relationship under his two immediate predecessors --- but others in his
administration are clearly concerned. While the administration intends
to "hold accountable" those responsible for Khashoggi's death, it also
needs to protect "the enormously important strategic interests the
United States maintains" with Riyadh, including the crucial Saudi role
in changing the behavior of Iran, "the world's largest state sponsor of
terror," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month.]{.underline}

#### The alliance is good -- helps the US economy by regulating global oil prices, and MBS is stepping up counterterrorism

Salem. \[Alex Ward is a writer for Vox News, Paul Salem is president of

won't break up with Saudi Arabia over Jamal Khashoggi's murder". Vox
News, Nov 20, 2018.
https://www.vox.com/2018/10/18/17990546/trump-jamal-khashoggi-saudiarabia-history-murder

[The US and Saudi Arabia are strong allies.]{.underline} When did this
relationship start, and what's the reason or reasons behind it? Paul
Salem It dates back to World War II, when oil became a very strategic
resource and Saudi Arabia had a lot of it. Both countries cemented their
relationship, which was centered around energy, in a famous meeting on
board a US naval ship in the Suez Canal between President Franklin D.
Roosevelt and the Saudi king in 1945. So energy was a pillar of the
early relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia
continues to be an essential producer and exporter of oil globally, and
has a huge impact on global oil prices. For a long time, the US got many
of its energy resources from Saudi Arabia. [Their partnership also
centered around global finance and economics. Much of Riyadh's great
wealth flowed into the US economy in terms of investments, arms
purchases, or other businesses setting up shop in Saudi Arabia. As the
Cold War took off, Saudi Arabia also became a strong ally of the US in
the fight against communism. The Saudis were religious and conservative,
and very much opposed the atheist wave led by the Soviet
Union.]{.underline} Alex Ward So to recap: The US-Saudi relationship
bloomed early on because of oil, mutual economic growth, and
anti-communist sentiment. Paul Salem Yes, that's right. Now let's jump
to the post-1979 period --- the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. [The US and
Saudi Arabia cooperated by arming the Islamic and jihadist opposition to
the Soviets, which eventually beat back the invasion. That, of course,
also created the problems of jihadism, al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, and
all the rest of it.]{.underline} And 1979 is also the year America lost
Iran as an ally, after the Islamic Revolution. Riyadh has sided with
Washington as it's confronted Tehran ever since. That partnership
continues. But then both countries faced a big test with 9/11, right?
Paul Salem Yes, and it greatly shook the Saudi-US relationship: 15 of
the 19 terrorists were Saudi. Of course, one of their principal goals
was to bring down the Saudi government. But nevertheless, they were
Saudis, and that created a huge backlash against Riyadh in the US. [When
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS) came to power, he
made counterterrorism one of the main pillars of the relationship with
the United States. He admitted that moves by Saudi Arabia since 1979 to
use radical Islam as a weapon against the Soviets or against the
Iranians backfired, and says he wants to change that policy. The
Khashoggi affair may be the second major crisis in their relationship
since 9/11.]{.underline} Does energy still matter as much as it did in
the relationship? Paul Salem It's still a very important pillar, though
the US no longer imports as much as it did from Saudi Arabia or the
Gulf. Most of those exports go to China, India, Japan, Korea, and so on.
But as President Trump has said repeatedly, global oil prices still have
a big impact in the US, and Saudi Arabia has a big role in raising or
lowering oil prices. [It seems like the US-Saudi alliance is based more
on strategic interests and convenience, not values. Yes, that's fair.
But for Saudi Arabia, the relationship is also about security: defending
its airspace, boundaries, and waters. But yes, the values have
profoundly differed for many stretches of the relationship. Saudi Arabia
is a different society and it has lived in a different way.]{.underline}
So when you have a case like this --- a US resident who wrote for the
Washington Post \[disappearing\] --- you see that occasionally, these
values lead to a clash. Alex Ward In the past, the US has criticized
Saudi Arabia, at least marginally, over its human rights abuses. But
America seems to be doing that less now. Paul Salem It's a feature of
the Trump administration. He says again and again that he believes it's
none of his business or none of America's business. He applies this to
Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern, Asian countries, or European
countries that have gone rather right-wing and fascist. President Obama
certainly spoke about these issues. But I would say he was a president
who, while speaking about it, did not do much to change the issue. I
think the US is moving away from actually protecting human rights around
the world. [It's partly because the US is no longer the dominant global
power that can just order people around. Alex Ward Has the relationship
been more beneficial throughout the years to Saudi Arabia or the United
States? It's beneficial to both, is the simple answer. The US certainly
gets a lot out of it, and Saudi Arabia certainly gets a lot out of it.
The US gets some leverage over oil prices and supplies, gets a lot of
petrodollar investments and huge contracts, and has a stable ally in a
very unstable Middle East. For Saudi Arabia, the US was key in its
development of building a modern state and providing for its security.
In terms of interests, they certainly both have benefited.]{.underline}

#### The alliance is key to pretty much every goal the US has in the Middle East

**[Cordesman]{.underline}**, Anthony.**[18]{.underline}** \[Arleigh A.

Studies in Washington, D.C. He has served as a consultant on Afghanistan

East". The Hill, 2018.
hĴps://thehill.com/opinion/international/379542-saudi-arabia-is-a-critical-americansecurity-partner-in-the-middle-east

[Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten that our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our most important
single security partner. Israel's security is certainly a key American
concern, but it does not play an active role in most of America's
ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with Iran, or in
a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS and Al
Qaeda.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner has also
been enhanced by the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their
own internal stability and their roles in the region have sharply
diminished, and Iraq and Syria both must deal with major instability
problems and are at war. Our European allies have declining power
projection capabilities, and Turkey's role in the region is increasingly
problematic. [It is certainly true that Saudi Arabia needs the United
States as much or more than the United States needs Saudi Arabia. Saudi
military forces are steadily improving, but it is the U.S. presence in
the region that create a balance of forces that firmly deters Iran and
has helped Saudi Arabia defeat its own terrorist threats from groups
like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. U.S. arms shipments, advisory
efforts and exercises also play a critical role in improving Saudi
forces.]{.underline} But the United States needs Saudi Arabia as well.
Saudi Arabia is now the most critical single security partner in
ensuring the stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf region. While the
United States is largely eliminating its need for direct petroleum
imports, it is steadily increasing its dependence on the health and
growth of the global economy and imports from Asian states like China,
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are critically dependent on Gulf
petroleum exports. The end result is that U.S. strategic interests in
the region continue to increase in spite of the steady cut in U.S.
direct oil imports. This is why focusing on more U.S. arms sales to
Saudi Arabia and Saudi investment in the United States, ignoring the
growing role Saudi Arabia has played in fight terrorism since 2003, down
playing the need to cooperate in checking Iran, and treating the war in
Yemen as is if Saudi Arabia does not face real threats is not the way
the United States should deal with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's
visit to the White House. [Saudi Arabia's reform and economic
development plans are critical to its stability and the region's
security. The kingdom needs U.S. encouragement and an understanding that
Saudi Arabia cannot implement these plans effectively without outside
support. The burden sharing argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia
cannot be treated as a source of ready money every time the United
States has a need.]{.underline} It is already spending more than 10
percent of its economy on security, which is three times the economic
burden security places on the United States. This spending is too high
given the kingdom's other needs, and the United States should be
focusing on better ways to make its security partnerships with Saudi
Arabia, as well as the other Gulf states and Jordan more efficient and
less costly, not simply on spending more. At [the same time, Iran is all
too real a threat. Effective joint action in dealing with Iran's nuclear
programs, its ballistic and cruise missile programs, its asymmetric
threats to Gulf shipping, and expending military influence in the region
are all critical common U.S. and Saudi priorities.]{.underline} [The
United States also badly needs to find some common approach to dealing
with Iraq and Syria that will move both towards recovery and lasting
stability, limit Iranian and Russian influence as much as possible, and
help stabilize relations with Turkey. There are no easy options in
either case, but Saudi Arabia is the key potential Arab partner any such
efforts.]{.underline}

#### The alliance is good -- reforms and counterterrorism efforts by MBS are real even if he killed Khashoggi -- also, the alternative to the alliance is US ground troops to secure objectives in the Middle East

into trusted partner in Middle East conflict". The Hill, Nov 4, 2018.

[It has been a month since Saudi writer and dissident Jamal Khashoggi
was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. That case may have
faded from the front page, but debates about American policy towards
Saudi Arabia remain heated. Democrats and quite a few Republicans have
vowed to punish the kingdom for his death and for the war in Yemen, but
these issues sidestep the basic problem.]{.underline} Unless the United
States wishes to return in force to the Middle East, Washington needs
Riyadh. The Middle East is a tangled web, but American interests have
been largely consistent across administrations, with the commitment to
security of Israel, containment of Iran, and suppression of Islamist
extremism. [The commitment to Israel is straightforward, executed
through aid and trade, and support for those at peace with the Jewish
state. The questions of Iran and Islamist extremism are more complex,
with policy in these areas vacillating from president to
president.]{.underline} On their face, the arguments against Saudi
Arabia are compelling. The kingdom is the godfather of Sunni extremism,
working for decades both to put its ultra conservative stamp on Islamic
practice worldwide and stifle more moderate iterations of Islamic
interpretation. Individual Saudis have underwritten terrorist groups
like Al Qaeda and others, making possible the attacks that have killed
thousands of Americans. [But there have been substantial changes since
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The regime cracked down, first on financing
of extremist groups, and then, to a certain extent, on the export of
religious radicalism. Since coming to power, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin
Salman has further throttled back support by the kingdom for Sunni
extremists and defanged the religious establishment at home. He is, as
he readily admits, no liberal reformer. But the reforms under his
leadership are indisputable]{.underline}

The Bomb?". Middle East Quarterly, Spring 2013.
https://www.meforum.org/3509/saudiarabia-nuclear-bomb

[Despite Riyadh's long-held advocacy of making the Middle East a zone
free of weapons of mass destruction, there has been much speculation in
the last two decades about the possibility of its acquiring or
developing nuclear weapons should Tehran obtain the
bomb]{.underline}.\[1\] In the words of King Abdullah: "If Iran
developed nuclear weapons ... everyone in the region would do the
same,"\[2\] a sentiment echoed by Prince Turki al-Faisal, former head of
Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Directorate.\[3\] Has Riyadh decided
to go down the nuclear road, or is this bluster a desperate bid to stop
Tehran's nuclear program dead in its tracks? Why Go Nuclear? A major
deterioration in U.S.-Saudi relations---especially if Washington fails
to stop Tehran's nuclear program or decides to scale back its military
presence in the Middle East due to its recent energy discoveries---
could force Riyadh to reconsider nuclear weapon acquisition to avoid
having to face foreign aggression without U.S. security assurances.
[However, the relationship between Riyadh and Washington has thus far
provided the Saudis with an unprecedented level of protection. From
Washington's perspective, conventional wisdom holds that U.S. security
commitments can keep Iran in check, prevent U.S. allies in the Middle
East from submitting to Tehran's demands, and dissuade them from
pursuing nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Yet both the willingness and the
ability of the U.S. government to defend its partners in the region
against a nuclear-armed Iran have been questioned.\[4\] As an Israeli
observer argued recently: The lack of American will to confront the
ayatollahs and stop them in their tracks has given various Arab leaders
plenty of incentive, as well as a good excuse, to proceed down the
nuclear trail \... If the [Iranians aren't stopped, and soon, we may
wake up a few years from now to discover that Saudi Arabia and other
unfriendly regimes have decided to upgrade their "civilian" nuclear
programs into weapons-making industries.]{.underline}

#### The only thing that's stopping a Saudi invasion is their relationship with the US -- absent fears over damaging the alliance, they would have acted on their invasion plan and taken the capital

**[Emmons]{.underline}**, Alex. \[Investigative journalist for The
Intercept\]. "Saudi Arabia Planned to Invade Qatar Last Summer. Rex
Tillerson's Efforts to Stop it May Have Cost Him His Job." The
Intercept, Aug 1, **[2018]{.underline}**.
https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/rex-tillersonqatar-saudi-uae/

[The Intercept has learned of a previously unreported episode that
stoked the UAE and Saudi Arabia's anger at Tillerson and that may have
played a key role in his removal. In the summer of 2017, several months
before the Gulf allies started pushing for his ouster, Tillerson
intervened to stop a secret Saudi-led, UAE-backed plan to invade and
essentially conquer Qatar,]{.underline} according to one current member
of the U.S. intelligence community and two former State Department
officials, all of whom declined to be named, citing the sensitivity of
the matter. In the days and weeks after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt,
and [Bahrain cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and closed down their land,
sea, and air borders with the country, Tillerson made a series of phone
calls urging Saudi officials not to take military action against the
country. The flurry of calls in June 2017 has been reported, but State
Department and press accounts at the time described them as part of a
broad-strokes effort to resolve tensions in the Gulf, not as an attempt
by Tillerson to avert a Saudi-led military operation]{.underline}.
Tillerson made a series of phone calls urging Saudi officials not to
take military action against Qatar. In the calls, Tillerson, who dealt
extensively with the Qatari government as the CEO of Exxon Mobil, urged
Saudi King Salman, then-Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and
Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir not to attack Qatar or otherwise
escalate hostilities, the sources told The Intercept. Tillerson also
encouraged Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to call his counterparts in
Saudi Arabia to explain the dangers of such an invasion. Al Udeid Air
Base near Doha, Qatar's capital city, is the forward headquarters of
U.S. Central Command and home to some 10,000 American troops. [Pressure
from Tillerson caused Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the
country, to back down, concerned that the invasion would damage Saudi
Arabia's long-term relationship with the U.S. But Tillerson's
intervention enraged Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi
and effective ruler of that country, according to the U.S. intelligence
official and a source close to the Emirati royal family, who declined to
be identified, citing concerns about his safety.]{.underline} Later that
June, Mohammed bin Salman would be named crown prince, leapfrogging over
his cousin to become next in line for the throne after his elderly
father. His ascension signaled his growing influence over the kingdom's
affairs. Qatari intelligence agents working inside Saudi Arabia
discovered the plan in the early summer of 2017, according to the U.S.
intelligence official. [Tillerson acted after the Qatari government
notified him and the U.S. embassy in Doha. Several months later,
intelligence reporting by the U.S. and U.K. confirmed the existence of
the plan. The plan, which was largely devised by the Saudi and UAE crown
princes and was likely some weeks away from being implemented, involved
Saudi ground troops crossing the land border into Qatar, and, with
military support from the UAE, advancing roughly 70 miles toward Doha.
Circumventing the U.S. air base, Saudi forces would then seize the
capital]{.underline}. On June 20, State Department spokesperson Heather
Nauert told reporters that Tillerson had "more than 20 calls and
meetings with Gulf and other regional and intermediate actors,"
including three phone calls and two meetings with Jubeir. "The more time
goes by, the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi
Arabia and the UAE," she said.

sanctions at the highest level of the Saudi regime --- an important
first step, [but the new Congress that will sit in January can and
should do more. We should go beyond the informal holds individual
senators have placed on weapons transfers to the kingdom and end the
arms sales regime entirely.]{.underline}

#### The US is committed to allies now

Agreement With Iran" July 23rd 2015

[However, part of the Gulf States' criticism is justified. In recent
years, the Obama administration has been so focused on the nuclear
question that it has largely ignored the question of Iranian regional
influence. While the administration has done a reasonable job of
managing one crisis after another in the region and avoided entangling
the United States in new conflicts, it has not articulated a clear
strategy and commitment to the Middle East that could reassure
partners.]{.underline} The United States has clearly recognized this
problem and begun to move to address it with the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) summit hosted by President Obama at Camp David in May
2015. This summit was the first step in what is likely to be a long
process of attempting to convince the Gulf states that the United States
is not pivoting to Iran and remains committed to their security. Impact
on the U.S.-Israel Relationship A nuclear agreement with Iran may also
have significant implications for the U.S.-Israel relationship. [It
could undermine trust between the United States and Israel, as it
already has with the very open and public disagreements between
President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Given their
history of close cooperation against common threats in the region,
particularly in the intelligence and security arena, this could hurt
both countries' interests. Iran's regional activities and its extreme
rhetoric threatening the existence of the Jewish state are causes of
concern for Israelis.]{.underline} However, Israel's greater concern
lies with the nuclear agreement itself. The most significant issue for
the Israelis is not necessarily the details of the agreement, such as
the number of centrifuges or the overall inspections regime, but the
question of enforcement. They believe that while Iran is likely to
respect an agreement during the early years of implementation, at some
point Iran will cheat or wait out the 10--15 year time period, at which
point many of the provisions sunset. [By this time, the international
community's attention will be diverted to other matters, there will be
no forceful response, eventually the deal will erode, and Iran will be
left with few limits on its nuclear program and no sanctions. Even as
they express their concerns about the nuclear agreement and the policies
of the Obama administration, many in the security establishment in
Israel are uncomfortable with the public confrontational approach taken
by Prime Minister Netanyahu in opposing the agreement. There is a widely
held view among Israeli security professionals that the best way for the
United States and Israel to work out their differences through private
consultations in which Israel could shape and influence American
thinking and try to improve the contents of the agreement. Instead, by
pursuing this direct confrontation and trying to use Congress to
undercut the deal, the prime Minister has turned support for Israel -- a
traditionally bipartisan issue -- into a politically contentious wedge
issue that has forced Democratic legislators to choose between the
president and leader of their party and the prime minister of
Israel.]{.underline} The good news is that even as political tensions
have risen, security cooperation has remained strong. The United States
continues to provide billions in security assistance to Israel,
including support for the Iron Dome System anti-rocket system, which
dramatically improved the security of Israel's population in recent
years. In the immediate aftermath of the agreement the Prime Minister is
likely to continue to strongly oppose an agreement both publicly and
privately. [However, once the political confrontation has ended, many in
both the United States and Israel hope that relations can begin to
improve and that the two traditional partners can return to operating as
they used to. The Way Forward: Regional and Non-Proliferation Policy in
the Aftermath of the Agreement While the agreement itself is critical,
what will be more decisive for its success or failure is the set of non-
proliferation and regional policies that the United States pursues in
the aftermath of the deal.]{.underline} In 10--15 years the world could
see a more moderate Iran, reduced instability in the Middle East, a
stronger global non-proliferation regime, and an environment in which
America's prestige and influence has increased as a result of the
nuclear agreement. On the other hand, with poor execution and the wrong
policies the United States could face a very different world in 2025: a
more hostile and aggressive Iran on the verge of nuclear weapons; [a
Middle East still drowning in sectarian violence and civil war; a
damaged non- proliferation regime; and an international perception that
the nuclear agreement with Iran was a historic mistake that
significantly harmed American interests. Congress, working with the
executive branch, can exercise its oversight responsibilities by trying
to promote policies that put the United States on the right path, such
as strengthening the agreement with mechanisms outside of the deal;
pushing back on Iran's support for surrogates and proxies in the
region]{.underline}; reassuring U.S. regional partners; and looking for
ways over time to improve communication with Iran and find some areas of
common interest. Strengthen the nuclear agreement by taking steps
outside of the P5+1 negotiations with Iran to set conditions for
effective long-term enforcement and implementation The United States
should work with key stakeholders including Congress, Israel, and the
P5+1 on a series of measures outside the direct negotiations with Iran
to strengthen the deal. The United States should derive from the final
agreement a clear and specific set of criteria to judge potential
Iranian violations. [These violations should then be tied to
proportional punitive steps that the president could take to respond in
the event of a violation. Establishing internal criteria and clearly
articulating it to Iran will increase the United States' ability to
deter Iranian violations and reduce the risk that Iran is able to slowly
erode the agreement through minor violations. The executive branch
should consult with Congress on this approach and together negotiate
legislation that includes some of these metrics and provides the
president the necessary authorities to impose punishments in the event
of violations.]{.underline} The legislation should also include rigorous
reporting criteria and the requirement for the executive branch to
provide quarterly high-level classified briefings to members of Congress
for the duration of the agreement. In an ideal world, Congress should
establish a subcommittee specifically dedicated to this issue, as it has
for other high-profile arms control agreements, to ensure long-term
monitoring and implementation. The legislation should include increased
funding for the IAEA, giving it the necessary resources to implement the
agreement in the most robust way possible -- particularly by adding more
inspectors and technology for monitoring. The IAEA is developing
estimates of how much it will cost it to implement the deal: Early
indictions from Director General Yukiya Amano suggest an additional cost
of approximately \$10 million per year -- a small price to pay for
greater transparency into Iran's nuclear program. More forcefully
counter Iranian actions that are against U.S. interests, most notably
their support for surrogates and proxies in the Middle East The United
States should significantly increase its efforts to counter Iran's
regional surrogates and proxies. Such an approach is intended to deter
Iranian meddling in the region by signaling to Iran's leadership,
particularly some of the hardliners and leaders of the IRGC-QF, that
Iran is not ascendant in the region and that if it pushes too far it
risks a direct conflict with the United States. These actions would also
signal to America's Arab partners, especially Saudi Arabia, that the
United States is not abandoning the region to Iran or pursuing the
feared "Persian Pivot."

#### US failure to provide the Saudis with arms causes them to get nuclear weapons and create an alliance with Pakistan

Ambitions". Middle East Quarterly, Spring 2013.

[The United States is still Saudi Arabia's most effective security
support, but if Washington distances itself from regional maĴers, the
gradual entrance of new players into the Gulf is
inevitable.]{.underline} The question of Saudi acquisition of a nuclear
deterrent is more relevant than ever when both enemies and friends of
the United States are looking at a possible regional drawdown on
Washington's part as well as a lack of support for the pro-Western
regimes that remain in place. If the U.S. government provides Riyadh
with formal security guarantees, it would be natural for it to demand
that the kingdom forego its strategic goals. [But Riyadh's inclusion
under a U.S. defense umbrella is not a given and depends both on the
quality of relations between the two countries and other Saudi
considerations. Riyadh remains skeptical over Washington's willingness
to come to its aid and may thus seek to purchase a nuclear deterrent,
which would provide it with more freedom vis-à-vis its stronger
ally.]{.underline} Under present circumstances, it is not unreasonable
for Riyadh to rely on other states for its defense in addition to
Washington for the simple reason that it has done so in the past.
Likewise, it is more than likely that the Saudis will not act
transparently because they have acted in secret previously. Conclusion
After Iran, Saudi Arabia is the number one candidate for further nuclear
proliferation in the Middle East. Open source evidence remains
circumstantial, but perhaps more than any other regional player, Riyadh
has the requisite ideological and strategic motives as well as the
financial wherewithal to act on the option. The kingdom may conclude
that its security constraints as well as the attendant prestige and
influence generated by having a bomb outweigh the political and economic
costs it will pay. [The difficulty in stopping Tehran's dogged quest for
a nuclear capability coupled with Riyadh's doubts about the reliability
of Washington is liable to encourage Riyadh to shorten timetables for
developing an independent nuclear infrastructure, as well as to opt to
purchase a turnkey nuclear system, an off-the-shelf product, or to enter
into a security compact of one sort with another power.]{.underline}
Sunni-majority Pakistan has emerged as the natural candidate for such an
arrangement. [Heavy U.S. pressure is likely to be brought to bear on the
Saudis not to acquire nuclear capabilities. Indeed, it seems that, at
present, the price Riyadh is likely to pay should it acquire military
nuclear capabilities might outweigh the advantages of such a
move.]{.underline} But strategic interest, motivated by considerations
of survival, could have the upper hand. Should it seem that the
kingdom's vital security interests are threatened, it may prefer to take
a series of steps, including obtaining a nonconventional arsenal, to
reduce risks and ensure the continuity of the House of Saud.

#### US arms sales to Saudis are the best way to stop them from proliferating -- they're the key signal of US commitment

**[Gause]{.underline}** III, F. Gregory. **[10]{.underline}**
\[Professor and chair of political science department, University of
Vermont\]. ""Is Big Saudi Arms Sale a Good Idea¿'. Council on Foreign
Relations, 2010.
https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea

[The Saudi arms sale will not buy much security in the long run in the
Persian Gulf. But there are no good reasons not to sell the Saudis those
weapons, and there are some potentially positive results]{.underline}
(besides the economic benefits to the U.S.) that might come from the
sale\--most importantly U.S. leverage on Riyadh on nuclear
[proliferation issues]{.underline}. The Iranian regional challenge is
based on the political and ideological links with important state and
sub-state actors in the region: Hezbollah, Hamas, various Iraqi parties,
the Syrian regime, and Shia activists in the Gulf monarchies. [Better
fighter jets and attack helicopters will not help the Saudis to contain
or roll back this kind of Iranian ideological influence. Still, one good
reason to move ahead with the sale is that there is no good reason not
to. Though some might oppose it on grounds of disliking the Saudi
political system, selling or not selling the arms is not going to affect
Saudi policies on democracy, women, Islam, or anything else one whit.
Moral purity would be purchased at the price of reduced American
regional influence. If the arms sale could destabilize the Saudi regime,
that would be a reason not to do it.]{.underline} Many think that U.S.
arms sales to the Shah \[of Iran\] in the 1970s helped to bring him
down, but arms were part of the larger strategic relationship, to which
many Iranians objected; the arms themselves did not cause the
relationship or the popular reaction against it. The Saudis and the
United States are similarly tied together in the eyes of Saudi citizens
and others in the region. But this arms sale would not change that
perception. The larger issue is whether we are selling arms to a stable
regime in Riyadh. The short answer is "yes." [Also, there are two
positive foreign policy consequences that could come from the sale. Its
psychological effect could give the Saudis more credibility with
regional elites in their contest for influence with Iran, making
potential Saudi allies in places like Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and
Yemen more confident in throwing in their lot with Riyadh. And if Iran
obtains a nuclear weapons capability, the Saudis would undoubtedly
consider the option of proliferating themselves.]{.underline} If they
are confident of their American security guarantee\--and these big arms
sales are warrants of the American commitment to their
security\--American advice not to obtain nuclear weapons will carry more
weight. In the end, the Saudis are going to buy weapons. If we do not
sell them, Moscow, London, Paris, and Beijing will.

#### Arms sales are the key internal link -- they're a huge signal of reassurance and commitment, which is uniquely important because the Saudis are irrationally scared that their regime will get overthrown due to the wake of the Arab Spring, which means any wavering in assurance causes an irrational reaction

President Obama arrived in Riyadh on Wednesday to join a Gulf
Cooperation Council summit. [The visit has been widely portrayed as a
bid to rebuild America's currently contentious relations with its Gulf
allies. Much of the discussion of U.S.-Saudi tensions has focused on
Gulf regime grievances over the nuclear deal with Iran and the American
refusal to intervene in Syria]{.underline}. As I argue in my forthcoming
book, "The New Arab Wars," the deeper driver of these tensions, however,
is the existential fear for regime survival unleashed by the Arab
uprisings and the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Arab leaders
suddenly feared that Washington would be unwilling or unable to come to
their rescue if they faced renewed popular mobilization. [The erratic
and counterproductive policies they pursued in response, at home and
across the region, have exacerbated their domestic problems --- and put
them sharply at odds with American strategic goals in the region. The
literature on alliance politics would find much of the surface tensions
between the United States and Saudi Arabia familiar]{.underline}. [The
public posturing about abandonment or resentments would usually be
understood as a fairly straightforward bargaining game. The dependent
partner complains of their fear of abandonment in order to pressure
their patrons for more financial, military or political support. The
stronger partner seeks ways to meet those demands without compromising
its own core interests]{.underline}. While the language is of
reassurance and commitment, the underlying logic is a colder one of
negotiations. \[International relations theory and a changing Middle
East\] Through such a bargaining game lens, Gulf leaders have been
frustrated not by Obama's weakness, but by his strength in refusing to
subordinate American interests to their preferences. Still, the overall
balance is well within the range of normal alliance politics. [The
Saudis have won on many important issues, while Obama has prevailed on
his own highest priorities. The Saudi side of the ledger includes
Obama's willingness to turn a blind eye to the sectarian repression of
Bahrain's uprising, support for an obviously doomed and devastating war
in Yemen, billions of dollars in arms sales and grudging acceptance of
the Gulf-backed military coup in Egypt.]{.underline} These were not easy
concessions for Obama, but his administration evidently viewed them as
an acceptable price for prevailing on his own highest priorities. [From
the start, he had identified an Iran nuclear deal as the highest
strategic priority for his administration, and he maintained an
impressive focus and clarity in achieving this goal.]{.underline} Obama
also managed to resist Saudi pressure for military intervention in
Syria, which he recognized would lead to a disastrous quagmire, even if
he was unable to prevent the reckless arming of Syria's insurgency and
the descent into a sectarian jihad fueled by Gulf and Turkish financing.
Since the emergence of the Islamic State, he has prioritized and
mobilized considerable regional support for his campaign to contain,
degrade and ultimately defeat the jihadist challenge. The twin Saudi
fears of entrapment and of abandonment, which have run through the
public discourse, are exactly what the alliance politics literature
would predict. Certainly, many in the Gulf express the belief that Obama
seeks an accommodation with Iran at their expense, if not a full
realignment toward Tehran. [What is more, they complain frequently that
Obama's unwillingness to intervene in Syria raises questions about
American commitments to militarily defend its allies. That these are
predictable gambits in the game of alliance politics does not mean that
Gulf elites do not actually feel these concerns intensely.
Constructivist international relations theorists are right, after all,
that discourse, identity and emotions matter more than rationalist
bargaining models admit.]{.underline} Still, what explains the
super-charged atmospherics of crisis and recrimination? Some might point
to the public rhetoric and messaging failures on both sides. The Obama
team has not masked its clear distaste for many Saudi policies. This
reticence has tended to undermine the reassurance impact of the very
real increase in material support to the Gulf, such as major new arms
sales. The new Saudi leadership, for its part, has adopted a
sharp-elbowed rhetorical style that has fueled the tensions. It does not
help that these rifts have unfolded in the midst of an American election
campaign, in which few policy analysts have an incentive to take the
side of the incumbent president. But none of that is really enough to
explain the current tensions in the relationship. The unusual intensity
of the current relationship is rooted in the profound feeling of
existential threat felt by most Gulf regimes ever since the eruption of
the Arab uprising. The Obama administration saw this extraordinary
moment of popular mobilization as an opportunity to finally bring
democracy to a politically stagnant region. The widespread belief that
Obama abandoned Mubarak, however misguided, deeply shook Arab leaders
who suddenly began to worry that Washington might not be able or willing
to come to their own protection if faced with a similar challenge. Arab
regimes saw the uprisings as a mortal threat to their grip on power, the
only thing about which they really cared. This existential fear for
monarchies' survival helps to explain the otherwise irrational nature
and degree of Gulf anxiety. For all their talk of American decline, the
Gulf leadership understands all too well that they still have nowhere
else to go. [Their military dependence on the United States has only
deepened --- even as they have pursued an aggressively independent
regional policy that often conflicts with American priorities. The
signature Saudi initiative to demonstrate its new military independence,
the Yemen war, has proved disastrous. And oil prices show few signs of
recovering. Gulf complaints about Washington are therefore driven as
much by their own deep internal government security concerns and policy
failures as by the more conventional explanations such as Iran and
Syria]{.underline}. Their responses to the Arab uprising ensured their
survival in the short term. But this came at great cost to their future
stability, creating a vicious cycle allowing no easy escape. The
collapsing price of oil only intensifies these regime security
challenges. Across the region, the more that these governments have
cracked down on domestic dissent, the more vulnerable they have become.

#### US ditching the Saudis militarily causes them to get nuclear weapons from Pakistan, which goes nuclear due to miscalculation, accidents, and historical mistrust

**[Kahl]{.underline}**, Colin. **[13]{.underline}** \[Security Studies
Professor at Georgetown\]. "Atomic Kingdom: If Iran Builds the Bomb,
Will Saudi Arabia Be Next?". Center For A New American Security, Feb

[Deepening U.S. economic malaise and fiscal constraints could also
produce much deeper cuts in the U.S. defense budget and a sharp turn
toward American military retrenchment. Some combination of these events
would likely alter Saudi calculations regarding available alternatives
and make a nuclear arrangement with Pakistan significantly more
probable]{.underline}. Our overall assessment has a good news/bad news
quality. The good news is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the
most destabilizing Saudi responses to the emergence of a nuclear-armed
Iran -- rapid development of a Saudi bomb or the acquisition of nuclear
weapons from Pakistan -- are also the least likely to occur. Other
possible Saudi reactions -- acquiring an external security guarantee
from Pakistan, or more likely, Washington, combined with pursuing a
conventional defense and long-term hedging strategy -- are more probable
and clearly preferable (see Figure 1). The bad news is that low
probability is not the same as no probability and all of the possible
Saudi responses entail significant risks and costs. In the near term, it
is technically impossible for Saudi Arabia to indigenously develop
nuclear weapons; the risk of Pakistan transferring nuclear weapons to
the Kingdom is also overstated. Nevertheless, the risk of the later
scenario is not zero. Moreover, even if Riyadh fails to acquire its own
nuclear weapons shortly after Iran does, a Saudi hedging strategy could
still produce such a capability over the long run. Either the
low-probability Pakistani option or the higher-probability hedging path
could lead to the emergence of a poly-nuclear Middle East, with profound
consequences for the region. [The basic principles of nuclear deterrence
that held during the Cold War, and that continue to hold in South and
East Asia today, would likely hold if there were multiple nuclear powers
in the Middle East. However, tensions and crises would probably
increase.]{.underline} [And even if all the relevant actors were assumed
to be rational, various factors -- the absence of secure second-strike
capabilities]{.underline} (at least for some period of time),
[unreliable early warning and command-and-control systems, close
geographic proximity and deep mutual distrust -- could still
inadvertently produce a regional nuclear war via miscalculations,
accidents or unauthorized use]{.underline}.183 It is also good news that
the Saudis are less likely to be attracted to a Pakistani extended
deterrence guarantee (and Islamabad is less likely to offer one) than is
commonly assumed. But should this moderate-probability scenario emerge,
it would extend the South Asian geopolitical competition directly into
the Middle East, thereby connecting two of the world's most crisis- and
conflict-prone regions into a nuclear daisy chain.

#### US military commitment to gulf states like Saudi Arabia is key in the face of a threatening Iran -- otherwise they'll get their own nuclear weapons

American Security. Prepared Statement of Ilan Goldenberg Testimony

Agreement With Iran" July 23rd 2015

[The United States should find ways to signal to its regional partners
that it remains committed to their security. It is still important to
maintain a robust conventional military presence in the Middle East
after an agreement to deter Iran from aggressively pursuing its
destabilizing activities in the region, violating the nuclear agreement
and threatening freedom of navigation and the flow of energy
resources.]{.underline} Despite the regional focus on the unconventional
Iranian threat, a conventional presence will also reassure partners that
the United States remains committed to their security. Providing the
Arab states greater confidence in American commitments will be a useful
tool for dissuading them from lashing out more aggressively at Iran in
ways that may exacerbate the sectarian divide. [It could also reduce the
likelihood that the Arab states would pursue their own domestic
enrichment capability in response to Iran. In pursuing this approach,
the United States will have to maintain a careful balance. A major
influx of U.S. assets to the region could be provocative, undermine both
Iran's confidence in the agreement and American intentions, and reduce
the likelihood of increased cooperation over time. But any significant
withdrawal of assets would shake the confidence of both the Arab states
and Israel.]{.underline} The guiding principle should be to maintain an
American force posture that is essentially the same or slightly
enhanced. The United States could consider forward stationing a limited
number of more advanced manned and unmanned aircraft and missile defense
assets in the region, but should not go too far beyond that. If the
agreement takes hold and over time Iran's behavior moderates, there is
the potential for a "peace dividend" in the long term.

#### US is key -- withdrawal and failure to take a strong stance against Iran causes the gulf states to start a war

[The ultimate problem is that the Gulf states are not strong enough to
take on Iran alone, and if they act provocatively toward Iran, even if
intended to deter Iranian aggression, they could easily provoke just
such aggression and/or overstretch their own limited capabilities with
potentially dire consequences for their own political
stability]{.underline}. If the United States is not there to reassure
the Gulf states and deter Iran, things could get very ugly.∂ The
American Role∂ Inevitably with any question related to the geopolitics
of the Middle East, the question eventually turns to the United States.
[The preceding analysis all points to the centrality of the American
response to the nuclear agreement with Iran as the critical factor that
will determine whether the deal ultimately proves beneficial or
detrimental to regional stability, and thus to American interests
themselves]{.underline}. As always, the United States is master of its
own fate to a much greater extent than any other country on earth, even
in the turbulent and unpredictable Middle East.∂ Two points seem to
stand out to me from the preceding analysis and the modern history of
the region. [The first is that while Iranian strategy is anti-American,
anti-status quo, anti-Semitic, aggressive and expansionist, it is not
reckless and typically quite wary of American power. When the U.S.
exerts itself, the Iranians typically retreat. The exception that proves
the rule was in Iraq in 2007]{.underline}, [when initially the Iranians
did not back down from their support to various anti-American Iraqi
militias, only to have those militias crushed and driven from Iraq
particularly during Operation Charge of the Knights and subsequent
Iraqi-American campaigns along the lower Tigris]{.underline}. As we see
in Iraq today, the Iranians apparently recognize that they misjudged
both America's will and its capacity to act then, and are once again
content to baĴle Washington for political influence in Baghdad, but
unwilling to challenge U.S. power militarily, even by proxy.∂ The second
is the other side of the coin from the first. In the absence of American
engagement, leadership and military involvement, the GCC states (led, as
always, by the Saudis) become frightened and their tendency is to lash
out and overextend themselves. Again, the unprecedented GCC air campaign
in Yemen is a striking example of this. [As the Gulf Arabs see it, they
have never seen the United States so disengaged from the region---at
least not in 35 years---and so they feel that they have had to take
equally exceptional action to make up for it. I continue to see the GCC
intervention in Yemen as a wholly unnecessary and unhelpful move, a rash
decision meant to check what the GCC sees as a looming Iranian
"conquest" of Yemen]{.underline}. In private, GCC officials make no
bones in saying that they felt compelled to do so because the United
States was embracing Iran rather than deterring or defeating it. While
all of that is a set of overstatements and exaggerations, it drives home
the point that in the absence of a strong American role in pushing back
on Iran, the GCC's default mode is to attack on their own, and that only
makes the situation worse, not better.

#### Saudis have the capability to create a domestic nuclear arsenal too -- they have civilian nuclear power that will get converted to nuclear weapons if their allies ditch them

[While a deal with Iran is unlikely to lead Saudi Arabia to immediately
launch a full nuclear military program, it may cause the Kingdom to
accelerate its nuclear hedging strategy---building up nuclear
infrastructure to keep future options open.]{.underline}1 Saudi Arabia
declared the foundation of its (civilian) nuclear intentions as early as
the conclusion of the December 2006 Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
annual summit, and since then has been investigating the use of nuclear
technology for a variety of purposes. In 2011, Saudi Arabia announced
its ambitious plan to build no fewer than sixteen nuclear power plants
at an estimated cost of over \$100 billion.2 [One of the concerns
associated with such civilian programs is that they could serve as a
basis to develop military programs should political circumstances,
threat perceptions, and allies' commitments change.3 Moreover, well
before any agreement's conclusion, some of the most senior Saudi princes
stated in recent years that if Tehran were granted the "right" to enrich
uranium, that would obligate the Kingdom to examine its own nuclear
path.]{.underline}

#### No tech barriers -- they can easily develop an indigenous military capability

"Actually, Saudi Arabia could get a nuclear weapon". CNN, 2015.
http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/middleeast/obaid-saudinuclear-weapon/

[Now that the Obama administration has largely given up its resistance
to Iran's development of some kind of nuclear program, the Middle East
is poised to see a change in the balance of power. As the Saudi
Ambassador to the United Kingdom recently stated, should Iran acquire a
nuclear weapon, "all options" could be on the table when it comes to the
Saudi response.]{.underline} That could include an indigenous nuclear
program. And although some commentators remain skeptical about the
Kingdom's ability to produce nuclear weapons, I would argue that it
actually has the will and the ability to do so. [There are six core
components that a country must possess in order to create a nuclear
program capable of being weaponized: 1) an adequate educational system,
2) skilled scientists, 3) financial means, 4) technological
infrastructure, 5) belief there is a pressing security threat, and 6)
the national will and leadership to do so.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia
possesses each of these. For a start, the Saudi educational system,
especially in the sciences, has improved in recent years, and is
undergoing changes that should see even greater progress. Meanwhile, the
Kingdom's education budget has more than doubled since 2005, with more
than \$350 billion spent on education since then. Indeed, in 2014,
spending on education and training represented about a quarter of the
governmental budget, and the Saudi leadership has funded a massive
foreign scholarship program that has seen more than 200,000 Saudis
studying abroad. [As a result, Saudi Arabia is the third largest student
"exporter" after China and India. In addition, Saudi Arabia has had
nuclear physicists with PhD's from Harvard, MIT, Stanford and other top
U.S. universities conducting advanced research in nuclear physics at the
King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) for decades
before the King Abdullah Atomic Energy City (KACARE) was created and
took over all nuclear matter]{.underline}. As detailed in a 2011 KACARE
white paper on the government's civil nuclear strategy, a select
committee of Saudi nuclear scientists has already conducted
groundbreaking research on an elaborate civil nuclear program. With this
in mind, as a Washington Institute for Near East Policy policy brief
notes, plans are in place for the "construction of sixteen nuclear power
reactors over the next twenty years at a cost of about \$80 billion."
King Salman is expected to give his final blessing before the end of
this year. [Depending on how the Iranian negotiations conclude, the
Saudi leadership will form a similar select committee to draft a white
paper on a weaponized nuclear program. One of the underlying
fundamentals of Saudi nuclear strategy has been to have a program based
on indigenous technology to ensure that the entire fuel cycle remains
under Saudi control. In short, the country doesn't want to buy nuclear
weapons from countries like Pakistan. The current Saudi nuclear
scientific community is perfectly capable of mastering the complexities
of such a program.]{.underline} Since the end of World War II, the
technology associated with producing plutonium and highly enriched
uranium has become more efficient and has served as the cornerstone of
most civilian nuclear programs around the world.

#### Saudis have the means to nuclearize and MBS will do it if the US isn't watching him -- internal governance structures in Saudi Arabia won't check -- most recent evidence

**[Dangoor]{.underline}**, Ronen. **[18]{.underline}** \[Writer for the
National Interest, former deputy head of the research and analysis
division at the Israeli prime minister's office\]. "The Crown Prince May
Build Himself a Nuclear Kingdom". National Interest, Nov 27, 2018.
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/crown-prince-may-build-himselfnuclear-kingdom-37292

[The crown prince has demonstrated arrogant, cruel, amateur and
capricious behavior. His aggression has been left almost unmonitored by
checks and balances inside the Saudi hierarchy]{.underline}. Indeed, MbS
has constrained all his potential rivals and has taken full control of
Saudi Arabia's security and intelligence bodies. [As the Khashoggi
scandal has proven---such power enables dictators to secretly execute
dangerous operations. In parallel, he managed to become the darling of
the West after he initiated economic reforms and launched his so called
modern 2030 vision]{.underline} . Now add Saudi's long history of
nuclear ambitions to the mix. [For years, Saudi officials have warned
that Saudi Arabia will not curb its nuclear ambitions if it will sense a
threat to its national security, or if Iran advances in its nuclear
program. Rumors were that Pakistan was obliged to provide the Saudis a
ready-for-use nuclear weapon if and when the time comes. Things only got
more complicated once the nuclear agreement (JCPOA) with Iran was signed
in 2015, practically legitimizing Iran's rights to maintain and develop
its uranium enrichment capabilities.]{.underline} At the beginning of
November 2018, the crown prince participated in the opening ceremony
marking the launch of construction of Riyadh's first research reactor .
It's still early days and only a symbolic act---the Saudis lack knowhow,
technicians, infrastructure and academic expertise---but the country has
both enough ambition and funds to advance anyway. Shortly after that the
Saudi energy minister said the kingdom launches uranium exploration
program. Over the last decade, purchasing sixteen nuclear power
reactors---later scaled back to two reactors---plus uranium enrichment
capabilities preferably from the United States, has featured prominently
on the Saudi agenda. [The official rationale is the country's future
needs to supply energy ---with self-sufficient nuclear materials. While
having enrichment capabilities can serve to counterbalance Iran, it may
also constitute a future military nuclear program. During previous
negotiations with Saudi officials, the Obama administration insisted
that Saudi Arabia must comply with the " gold standard ," reflective of
the conditions imposed on the UAE when it agreed to buy U.S. reactors in
2009]{.underline}. This standard requires a commitment not to enrich
uranium or to produce plutonium as a strict condition for any agreement
to sell nuclear reactors. According to current Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo, the Trump administration has maintained this policy . In an
interview with CBS in March 2018, MbS maintained that "without a doubt,
if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we would follow suit as soon as
possible." Following the murder of Khashoggi, [Senate members urged the
Trump administration to curb any intention to sell nuclear reactors to
the Saudi regime. This move is certainly necessary, but not nearly
enough. An American refusal to his demands can push the prince to seek
an alternative option elsewhere, with producers that will be all too
happy to assist---for the right price]{.underline}. Much of MbS's
current conduct lies parallel to previous experience with three other
Middle East tyrants: former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, Libya's
leader Muammar el-Qaddafi, and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. [These
cynical dictators have a common denominator in their infinite ambitions,
which ultimately led them to secretly promote a nuclear weapons program.
They all relied heavily on their security systems in initiating these
plans. Libya and Syria had no sufficient nuclear infrastructure, so they
bought a turnkey nuclear project from Pakistan's A.Q. Khan Network, and
in the Syrian case from North Korea]{.underline}. The Saudi nuclear
issue has placed a challenge before the administration. If the prince is
successful in surviving the current crisis, then that could prompt him
to make even riskier decisions, including taking the nuclear path. Much
like in Iraq, Libya and Syria, all the necessary components for that are
now in place: A de facto dictator with delusions of grandeur and poor
judgment, full control over the security services, unlimited funds for
the purpose, a national sense of isolation, an acute threat, and a
long-term nuclear vision. As Iran seems to be complying with the JCPOA,
a Saudi move could instigate a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. To
avoid this, the Trump administration should warn and restrict the Saudi
heir. It should also keep a very close eye on Saudi Arabia's nuclear

from pursuing its own nuclear weapons program should Iran successfully
acquire nuclear weapons capability, thereby altering the regional

The United States and other international powers will certainly exert
significant pressure on Riyadh, and the provisions of the [NPT will loom
large--- but the perception of the United States as an unreliable ally

through a shift from the civilian to a nuclear weapons
program,]{.underline} or in the short term by acquiring its own nuclear
deterrent[, or by forming an alliance with another existing nuclear

#### Saudi prolif in response to Iran would include a nuclear alliance with Pakistan that causes India freak-out and nuclear war

[A former Bush defense official says that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan
might initiate a dangerous alliance if Iran develops nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Andrew Roberts speaks to Eric Edelman about the
unintended consequences for South Asia. Might the impending
nuclearization of Iran rapidly lead to a situation in which India
targets nuclear weapons on Saudi Arabia? That is one of the many
unnerving repercussions envisaged in an authoritative article, "The
Dangers of a Nuclear Iran," in the current issue of Foreign Affairs,
written by, among others, Eric Edelman, President George W. Bush's
undersecretary of defense for policy from 2005 to 2009. When an analyst
of Edelman's seniority and ability, who moreover was working in the
Pentagon with full access to all the available intelligence on precisely
this issue as recently as two years ago, pronounces on questions of this
gravity it behooves us to pay serious attention. [Writing under the
auspices of the high-powered defense think tank the Center for Strategic
and Budgetary Assessments, Edelman and two colleagues examine the
ramifications of Saudi Arabia attempting swiftly to acquire nuclear
weapons from Pakistan the moment that it is clear that Iran has
them.]{.underline} He reports "rumors that Riyadh and Islamabad have had
discussions involving nuclear weapons, nuclear technology, or security
guarantees[." Now, people who have held jobs as sensitive as Edelman's
do not report "rumors" in a respected journal like Foreign Affairs
unless they believe them to be very much more than that]{.underline}.
Both in the article and more fully in an interview I have conducted with
him today, Edelman sets out his thinking on a subject that should have
very profound implications for decision-making in the Obama
administration as it considers the long term ramifications of permitting
Iran to go nuclear. For although we can all see the primary and perhaps
also the secondary implications for security in the Middle East of the
so-called containment strategy, the [United States must now ponder the
long-term tertiary and even later consequences. One of these must be
what Edelman terms "the Islamabad option," by which the Saudis and
Pakistanis would effectively enter into an offensive-defensive
"dual-key" nuclear arrangement, rather like the one the U.S. has had
with Britain from the late-1960s to the present day. The Saudis have
already indicated privately---and WikiLeaks has done nothing to cast
doubt on this---that when what Edelman terms "the nuclear cascade" is
unleashed once Iran goes nuclear, they will be in the first
wave]{.underline}. "Saudi Arabia is the lynchpin," says Edelman, "the
key country." The extremely close links between the two Sunni countries
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which go back at least as far as 1979 when
Pakistan helped to clear Islamic fundamentalists out of the Grand
Mosque, and A.Q. Khan's time in Saudi Arabia at precisely the time when
his nuclear-proliferation ring was at its most active, invite what
Edelman guardedly calls "speculation" that a mutually convenient
arrangement would be arrived at very soon after Iran went nuclear.
"Pakistan could sell operational nuclear weapons and delivery systems to
Saudi Arabia," states Edelman, "or it could provide the Saudis with the
infrastructure, material, and the technical support they need to produce
nuclear weapons themselves within a matter of years, as opposed to a
decade or longer." The Saudis might not even, technically at least, be
violating the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty if the weapons remained
operated by the Pakistanis, albeit on Saudi territory. Nor does Congress
consider this all to be mere "speculation" either: The Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations Staff Report of February 2008 stated that there was
"some circumstantial evidence" to suggest that an agreement of some sort
might already exist between the two countries. Where Edelman goes an
important stage further than anyone else is in considering the
instability that would inevitably result in Southern Asia if Pakistan
gained the capability in Saudi Arabia to withstand a first strike from
India's nuclear arsenal. "[To have a second-strike capability against
India would give Pakistan a huge benefit," he told me. "It would be very
troublesome for the Indians, who would face a far more complex nuclear
picture. We in the West have gotten fat, dumb, and happy when
contemplating a relatively stable nuclear Southern Asia over the past
decade. It might not stay like that." With Pakistan already ahead of
India in nuclear weapons technology, especially in delivery
capabilities, Edelman believes that the Islamabad option will make the
nuclear situation in South Asia significantly more
dangerous.]{.underline}

#### Pakistan impact happens fast -- they already have an agreement to transfer nuclear weapons to the Saudis immediately if the Saudis ever ask for them

content/pakistan-has-complicated-nuclear-relationship-with-saudi-arabia-iran/2710343.html

ISLAMABAD--- [Iran's foreign minister visits Pakistan Wednesday to
discuss the conflict in Yemen, which many see as a fight for influence
between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran also has recently
reached a framework nuclear agreement with six world powers to possibly
curb the weapons potential of its nuclear program]{.underline}. Saudi
Arabia, in the past, has reportedly sought to form its own nuclear
alliances to counter a perceived Iranian threat. A member of the Saudi
royal family and the kingdom's former intelligence chief, Prince Turki
al-Faisal, warned a few months ago that the kingdom would seek the same
nuclear capabilities that Tehran is allowed to maintain under any deal.
In this regard, Pakistan's relationship with the kingdom is unusual. [On
one hand, it has sold nuclear secrets to Iran in the past through a
network run by former chief Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan. The
network also sold nuclear technology or know-how to Libya and North
Korea. On the other, it has faced allegations of promising Saudi Arabia
a nuclear umbrella against Iran]{.underline}. 'Unacknowledged nuclear
partnership' Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project of the
Washington-based Brookings Institute, wrote in 2008 that Pakistan has
"an unacknowledged nuclear partnership to provide the kingdom with a
nuclear deterrent on short notice if ever needed." A BBC Newsnight story
in 2013 declared that Saudi nuclear weapons were practically "on order"
from Pakistan. "Saudi Arabia has invested in Pakistani nuclear weapons
projects, and believes it could obtain atomic bombs at will," the story
said based on sources. [As late as last month, a Wall Street Journal
story on Saudi nuclear ambitions declared: "Saudi officials have told
successive U.S. administrations they expect to have Pakistan's support
in the nuclear field, if called upon, because of the kingdom's massive
financial support for the South Asian country." While Pakistan denies
all of these allegations - and unlike Pakistan's nuclear dealings with
Iran, Libya and North Korea, the Saudi connection has never been
officially proven - its past behavior makes people
suspicious]{.underline}. "We know that Pakistan's nuclear program was
heavily subsidized by outsiders, financed by outsiders," Pakistani
nuclear physicist Abdul Hameed Nayyer said. Some of those, such as
Libya, who helped finance the program, received help with their nuclear
programs in return. Evidence of Pakistan's involvement was discovered
when Libya abandoned its nuclear program and turned over its equipment
to the United States. "[If Saudi Arabia also financed Pakistan's nuclear
program, it is possible that Saudi Arabia would also demand such a thing
from Pakistan," Nayyer said. While there is no concrete evidence of
Saudi financing of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, critics point to
ancillary support.]{.underline}

#### Independent of Pakistan, Saudi proliferation causes domino proliferation in the Middle East which goes nuclear for a laundry list of reasons -- close geographical proximity, launch on warning posture, and high tensions make preemptive strikes and miscalculation inevitable

**[Edelman]{.underline}**, Eric. **[11]{.underline}** \[Distinguished
Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments & Former
U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy\]. "The Dangers of a Nuclear
Iran". Foreign Affairs, 2011.

How would this expanded nuclear competition influence stability during a
crisis in either the Middle East or South Asia? [Regardless of India's
reaction, any decision by the Saudi government to seek out nuclear
weapons, by whatever means, would be highly destabilizing. It would
increase the incentives of other nations in the Middle East to pursue
nuclear weapons of their own. And it could increase their ability to do
so by eroding the remaining barriers to nuclear proliferation: each
additional state that acquires nuclear weapons weakens the
nonproliferation regime, even if its particular method of acquisition
only circumvents, rather than violates, the NPT.]{.underline} Were Saudi
Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons, the Middle East would count three
nuclear-armed states, and perhaps more before long. It is unclear how
such an n-player competition would unfold because most analyses of
nuclear deterrence are based on the U.S.- Soviet rivalry during the Cold
War. It seems likely, however, that the interaction among three or more
nuclear-armed powers would be more prone to miscalculation and
escalation than a bipolar competition. [During the Cold War, the United
States and the Soviet Union only needed to concern themselves with an
attack from the other. Multi- polar systems are generally considered to
be less stable than bipolar systems because coalitions can shift
quickly, upsetting the balance of power and creating incentives for an
attack]{.underline}. More important, emerging nuclear powers in the
Middle East might not take the costly steps necessary to preserve
regional stability and avoid a nuclear exchange. For nuclear-armed
states, the bedrock of deterrence is the knowledge that each side has a
secure second strike capability, so that no state can launch an attack
with the expectation that it can wipe out its opponents' forces and
avoid a devastating retaliation. However, emerging nuclear powers might
not invest in expensive but survivable capabilities such as hardened
missile silos or submarine- based nuclear forces. Given this likely
vulnerability, the close proximity of states in the Middle East, and the
very short flight times of ballistic missiles in the region, any new
nuclear powers might be compelled to "launch on warning" of an attack or
even, during a crisis, to use their nuclear forces preemptively. Their
governments might also delegate launch authority to lower-level
commanders, heightening the possibility of miscalculation and
escalation. [Moreover, if early warning systems were not integrated into
robust command-and-control systems, the risk of an unauthorized or
accidental launch would increase further still. And without
sophisticated early warning systems, a nuclear attack might be
unattributable or attributed incorrectly. That is, assuming that the
leadership of a targeted state survived a first strike, it might not be
able to accurately determine which nation was responsible. And this
uncertainty, when combined with the pressure to respond quickly, would
create a significant risk that it would retaliate against the wrong
party, potentially triggering a regional nuclear war]{.underline}. Most
existing nuclear powers have taken steps to protect their nuclear
weapons from unauthorized use: from closely screening key personnel to
developing technical safety measures, such as permissive action links,
which require special codes before the weapons can be armed. [Yet there
is no guarantee that emerging nuclear powers would be willing or able to
implement these measures, creating a significant risk that their
governments might lose control over the weapons or nuclear material and
that nonstate actors could gain access to these items]{.underline}

#### MAD doesn't check -- proliferation causes war even with rational states and MAD

**[Kroenig]{.underline}**, Matthew. **[15]{.underline}** \[Matthew
Kroenig is an Associate Professor and International Relations Field
Chair in the Department of Government at Georgetown University and a
Nonresident Senior Fellow in the Brent Scowcroft Center on International
Security at The Atlantic Council "The History of Proliferation Optimism:
Does It Have a Future?", Journal of Strategic Studies, 2015.
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/ 01402390.2014.893508

First and foremost, proliferation optimists present an oversimplified
view of nuclear deterrence theory. Optimists argue that since the advent
of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), any nuclear war would mean
national suicide and, therefore, no rational leader would ever choose to
start one. [Furthermore, they argue that the requirements for
rationality are not high. Rather, leaders must value their own survival
and the survival of their nation and understand that intentionally
launching a nuclear war would threaten those values.]{.underline} Many
analysts and policymakers attempt to challenge the optimists on their
own turf and question whether the leaders of potential proliferant
states are fully rational.34 [Yet, these debates overlook the fact that,
apart from the optimists, leading nuclear deterrence theorists believe
that nuclear proliferation contributes to a real risk of nuclear war
even in a situation of MAD among rational states.]{.underline}35
Moreover, realizing that nuclear war is possible does not depend on
peculiar beliefs about the possibility of escaping MAD.36 Rather, as we
will discuss below, these theorists understand that some risk of nuclear
war is necessary in order for deterrence to function. To be sure, in the
1940s, Viner, Brodie, and others argued that MAD rendered war among
major powers obsolete, but nuclear deterrence theory soon advanced
beyond that simple understanding.37 [After all, great power political
competition does not end with nuclear weapons. And nuclear-armed states
still seek to threaten nuclear-armed adversaries. States cannot credibly
threaten to launch a suicidal nuclear war, but they still want to coerce
their adversaries. This leads to a credibility problem: how can states
credibly threaten a nuclear-armed opponent]{.underline}? Since the
1960s, academic nuclear deterrence theory has been devoted almost
exclusively to answering this question.38 And their answers do not give
us reasons to be optimistic. Thomas Schelling was the first to devise a
rational means by which states can threaten nuclear-armed opponents.39
He argued that leaders cannot credibly threaten to intentionally launch
a suicidal nuclear war, but they can make a 'threat that leaves
something to chance'. 40 They can engage in a process, the nuclear
crisis, which increases the risk of nuclear war in an attempt to force a
less resolved adversary to back down. As states escalate a nuclear
crisis there is an increasing probability that the conflict will spiral
out of control and result in an inadvertent or accidental nuclear
exchange. As long as the benefit of winning the crisis is greater than
the incremental increase in the risk of nuclear war, however, threats to
escalate nuclear crises are inherently credible. In these games of
nuclear brinkmanship, the state that is willing to run the greatest risk
of nuclear war before backing down will win the crisis, as long as it
does not end in catastrophe. It is for this reason that Thomas Schelling
called great power politics in the nuclear era a 'competition in risk
taking'. 41 [This does not mean that states eagerly bid up the risk of
nuclear war. Rather, they face gut-wrenching decisions at each stage of
the crisis. They can quit the crisis to avoid nuclear war, but only by
ceding an important geopolitical issue to an opponent.]{.underline} Or
they can the escalate the crisis in an attempt to prevail, but only at
the risk of suffering a possible nuclear exchange. Since 1945 there were
have been 20 high stakes nuclear crises in which 'rational' states like
the United States run a frighteningly-real risk of nuclear war.42 By
asking whether states can be deterred, therefore, proliferation
optimists are asking the wrong question. The right question to ask is:
what risk of nuclear war is a specific state willing to run against a
particular opponent in a given crisis? Optimists are likely correct when
they assert that a nuclear-armed Iran will not intentionally commit
national suicide by launching a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack on the
United States or Israel. This does not mean that Iran will never use
nuclear weapons, however. Indeed, it is almost inconceivable to think
that a nuclear-armed Iran would not, at some point, find itself in a
crisis with another nuclear-armed power. It is also inconceivable that
in those circumstances, Iran would not be willing to run some risk of
nuclear war in order to achieve its objectives[. If a nuclear-armed Iran
and the United States or Israel were to have a geopolitical conflict in
the future, over the internal politics of Syria, an Israeli conflict
with Iran's client Hizballah, the US presence in the Persian Gulf,
shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, or some other issue, do we
believe that Iran would immediately capitulate?]{.underline} Or is it
possible that Iran would push back, possibly brandishing nuclear weapons
in an attempt to coerce its adversaries? If the latter, there is a risk
that proliferation to Iran could result in nuclear war and proliferation
optimists are wrong to dismiss it out of hand. An optimist might counter
that nuclear weapons will never be used, even in a crisis situation,
because states have such a strong incentive, namely national survival,
to ensure that nuclear weapons are not used. But this objection ignores
the fact that leaders operate under competing pressures. Leaders in
nuclear-armed states also have strong incentives to convince their
adversaries that nuclear weapons might be used. Historically we have
seen that leaders take actions in crises, such as placing nuclear
weapons on high alert and delegating nuclear launch authority to
low-level commanders, to purposely increase the risk of nuclear war in
an attempt to force less-resolved opponents to back down. [Moreover, not
even the optimists' first principles about the irrelevance of nuclear
posture stand up to scrutiny. Not all nuclear wars would be equally
devastating.43 Any nuclear exchange would have devastating consequences
no doubt, but, if a crisis were to spiral out of control and result in
nuclear war, any sane leader would rather face a country with five
nuclear weapons than one with 5,000. Similarly, any sane leader would be
willing to run a greater risk of nuclear war against the former state
than against the latter.]{.underline} Indeed, scholars have demonstrated
that states are willing to run greater risks and are, therefore, more
likely to win nuclear crises when they enjoy nuclear superiority over
their opponents.44 Proliferation optimists might be correct that no
rational leader would choose to launch a suicidal nuclear war, but,
depending on the context, any sane leader would almost certainly be
willing to risk one. Nuclear deterrence theorists have also proposed a
second scenario under which rational leaders would be willing to
instigate a nuclear exchange: limited nuclear war.45 For example, by
launching a single nuclear weapon against a small city, a nuclear-armed
state could signal its willingness to escalate a crisis, while leaving
its adversary with enough left to lose to deter the adversary from
launching a full-scale nuclear response. In a future crisis between
China and the United States, for example, China could choose to launch a
nuclear strike on a US military base in East Asia to demonstrate its
seriousness. In that situation, with the continental United States
intact, would Washington choose to launch a full-scale nuclear war on
China that could result in the destruction of many American cities? Or
would it back down? China might decide to strike after calculating that
Washington would prefer a humiliating retreat over a full-scale nuclear
war. If launching a limited nuclear war could be a rational strategic
move under certain circumstances, it then follows that the spread of
nuclear weapons increases the risk of nuclear use. [To be sure, some
strategic thinkers, including Henry Kissinger, advocated limited nuclear
war as a viable strategy only to recant the position later due to fears
of uncontrollable escalation. Yet, this does not change the fact that
leading nuclear deterrence theorists maintain that limited nuclear war
is possible among rational leaders in a MAD world]{.underline}.46

### Iran

#### Arms sales are good -- they cement an alliance that's key to oil access, counterbalancing Iran, beating Al Qaeda, and stopping a regional nuclear arms race

**[Cordesman,]{.underline}** Anthony **[18]{.underline}**. \[Arleigh A.
Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, D.C. He has served as a consultant on Afghanistan
to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of State\].
"Is Big Saudi Arms Sale a Good Idea?". Council on Foreign Relations,
2010. https://www.cfr.org/expertroundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea

[The United States shares critical strategic interests with Saudi Arabia
that shape the proposed Saudi arms sale. First, for all the talk of
energy independence over the last four decades, the U.S. Department of
Energy estimates that the United States will be as strategically
dependent on imported oil through 2035 as it is today.]{.underline}
These projections do not even take account of our indirect imports of
oil in the form of manufactured goods, or our dependence on the health
of a global economy that requires stable supply- and market-driven
prices. [The stability of Gulf energy exports is critical to our economy
and every job in the United States Second, U.S. military power is
finite, and both the United States and Saudi Arabia face rapidly
changing threats. The United States needs allies that have interoperable
forces that can both fight effectively alongside the United States and
ease the U.S. burden by defending themselves. Iran already poses a
massive asymmetric naval-air-assault force threat to the Gulf states.
The U.S. invasion of Iraq has left Iraqi forces a decade away from being
a counterbalance to Iran; Saudi Arabia is the only meaningful regional
power to work with. Additionally, al-Qaeda in the peninsula is based in
Yemen, and the threat of terrorism and outside infiltration means highly
mobile Saudi forces are critical to the security of Saudi energy and
civil facilities. Helping Saudi Arabia create a combination of effective
air and naval power also helps ensure the security of tanker and other
shipping in the Gulf of Oman and a steadily more unstable Red
Sea]{.underline}. "The United States needs allies that have
interoperable forces that can both fight effectively alongside the
United States and ease the U.S. burden by defending themselves." Third,
Iran already poses a missile and chemical weapons threat and may pose a
nuclear one within the next three to five years. Upgrades of the Saudi
Patriots create a base for an integrated approach to air and missile
defense. They lay the groundwork for follow-on sales of advanced missile
defense systems like THAAD, and an emphasis on defense (not Saudi
purchases of missiles or nuclear systems). [Coupled with recent U.S.
offers of "extended regional deterrence" and the creation of a Saudi Air
Force that is more of a threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles
are to Saudi Arabia, they offer the best hope of both giving Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf states security and stopping a nuclear arms race
in the region. Fourth, the proposed arms sale package creates a level of
interdependence that gives both the current Saudi government as well as
Saudi governments for the next fifteen to twenty years a strong
incentive to work with the United States. Saudi Arabia will need
continuing support from the United States during the entire lifecycle of
every major system sold, and no future Saudi government can ignore this
fact. Moreover, the sales are large in dollar terms, but not in terms of
numbers of weapons.]{.underline} This will not be some kind of massive
build-up. Saudi Arabia had an air force with some 417 combat aircraft in
2000, and it now has only 219. The Saudi F-15 buy will not even restore
the force to 2000 numbers. It will take some three to five years to
deliver and put fully in service, replace some eighty-seven obsolete
F-5A/Bs and F-5EIIs that were in service in 2000, and help Saudi Arabia
compensate for the serious performance limits on 107 aging Tornados
still in service.

#### Ending arms sales will not end Yemen War 

**[Foreign Affairs 19
(]{.underline}**<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/yemen/2019-05-02/real-plan-end-war-yemen>)

A degree of normalcy has returned to Yemen's biggest seaport,
[Hodeidah](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-06-27/new-front-yemen),
thanks to a cease-fire among the country's warring factions that has
held since December 2018. But beyond the port's outskirts, a vicious
fight between Houthi insurgents and a Saudi-led military coalition rages
on. The death toll keeps climbing; malnutrition and hunger are rampant.
Yemen's humanitarian crisis, the United Nations
[warned](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032811) in February, is
the worst in the world today. [In Washington, a growing chorus of
analysts and politicians has called on the United States to step up,
withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi war effort, and turn the UN-brokered
cease-fire into a lasting peace. Doing so, they argue, is the only
morally and strategically defensible course of action. But of all the
options before the United States, this one is the least likely to stop
the killing, the dying, and the complications for U.S. interests. The
Saudi-led intervention may have exacerbated the situation in Yemen, but
it did not start the war. Getting the Saudis to pull out will no more
end the bloodshed in Yemen than getting the United States to abstain
from the civil war in Syria halted the violence there. Nor will a Saudi
withdrawal lead to a negotiated settlement. Instead, the fighting will
go on, and innocent Yemenis will continue to die until one side---most
likely the Houthis---have won. True peace in Yemen will remain elusive
unless both sides accept that they have nothing to gain from more
fighting. We are not there yet. To get there will require not cutting
off U.S. support for Saudi Arabia but threatening to double down on it
unless the Houthis honor their commitments to the UN and are ready to
disgorge most of their initial conquests. If Washington is serious about
ending the war, it must come to terms with this uncomfortable
fact]{.underline}

[**by preparing to send hundreds of troops to the country amid
increasing tensions with Iran.** Five-hundred troops are expected to go
to the Prince Sultan Air Base, located in a desert area east of the
Saudi capital of Riyadh, according to US two defense officials. A small
number of troops and support personnel are already on site with initial
preparations being made for a Patriot missile defense battery as well as
runway and airfield improvements, the officials said. The US has wanted
to base troops there for some time because security assessments have
shown Iranian missiles would have a difficult time targeting the remote
area.]{.underline} The decision comes as US and Saudi relations remain

1,000 additional troops to the Middle East as Iran tensions flared but
did not specify which countries they were going to. The forces going to
Saudi Arabia are part of this deployment. [Congress has not been
formally notified of the deployment, although one official told CNN that
they had been given an informal heads up and an announcement is expected
next week.]{.underline} The notification to Congress will provide more
precise details about the US military deployments to the region that
have already been publicly announced. Commercial high-resolution
satellites, captured by Planet Labs and obtained by CNN, show an initial
deployment of US troops and support personnel to the air base in
mid-June, according to Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia
Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International
Studies at Monterey, who has studied the new images. Subsequent imagery
captured in late June and early July appear to show preparations being
made to the site ahead of the deployment of US troops, Lewis said. \"A
small encampment and construction equipment appeared at the end of a
runway by June 27, suggesting that improvements are already underway.
The encampment to the east of the runway is typical of Air Force
engineering squadrons deployed overseas,\" he told CNN. The US hopes to
be able to fly stealth, fifth-generation F-22 jets and other fighters
from the base, according to officials. [[Iran\'s foreign minister says
Tehran \'will never start a war,\' but will defend
itself](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/zarif-zakaria-interview/index.html)
So far, the Pentagon is declining to comment on the deployment due to
longstanding Saudi sensitivities about having US troops in the Kingdom.
The Saudis have also not announced US troops are coming to the
country.]{.underline} In May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally
told lawmakers of the administration\'s plan to use a pre-existing rule
that would allow it to expedite arms sales to allies in the Middle East,
including Saudi Arabia. \"These sales will support our allies, enhance
Middle East stability, and help these nations to deter and defend
themselves from the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" Pompeo said in a
statement at the time that put the value of the sales at \$8.1 billion.

precedent it sets, questioning the administration\'s claims of an
emergency and raising the issue of Saudi Arabia\'s human rights record
and Khashoggi\'s murder. Last month, several House lawmakers reasserted
their view that an emergency declaration was not needed. \"The emergency
declaration is nothing more than an egregious abuse of power by an
Administration that doesn\'t like being told, \'No.\' There is no
emergency, but there is a conflict in Yemen that has killed thousands of
civilians with US-made weapons and a Congress that is tired of being
complicit,\" California Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said in a statement.
[Earlier this month, [a group of bipartisan senators introduced a
bill](http://www.cnn.com/2019/07/10/politics/saudi-arabia-accountability-bill/index.html)
aimed at creating accountability in the US-Saudi relationship, despite
past failed attempts to provide oversight of the Trump administration\'s
dealings with the Gulf kingdom. The bill would require the secretary of
state, in coordination with the defense secretary, the director of
national intelligence and the treasury secretary, to prepare a
comprehensive report and present it to Congress within 270 days. The
report would need to examine foreign policy goals, risks, Saudi
Arabia\'s relations with other countries like China and Russia, and its
human rights record.]{.underline}

#### No U.S.-Iran War

**[[Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran) has declared it "will
not wage war against any nation" after the US announced that a further
1,000 troops are to be sent to the Middle East amid rising
tensions.]{.underline}** The US move, announced by the acting defence
secretary, Patrick Shanahan, comes after the US blamed Iran for [attacks
on two oil tanker
ships](https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jun/14/footage-us-military-claims-shows-iranian-patrol-boat-removing-limpet-mine-from-tanker-video)
last week, which has raised fears of a confrontation, and [Tehran
declaring](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/iran-it-will-break-uranium-stockpile-limit-set-nuclear-deal)
it had increased its rate of uranium enrichment. **[Shanahan said the
troop deployment was for "defensive purposes", citing concerns about a
threat from [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran). "The recent
Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have
received on hostile behaviour by Iranian forces and their proxy groups
that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region,"
he said in a statement. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, replied
on Tuesday that Iran had no desire for conflict. "Iran will not wage war
against any nation," Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state
TV. "Those facing us are a group of politicians with little experience."
He added: "Despite all of the Americans' efforts in the region and their
desire to cut off our ties with all of the world and their desire to
keep Iran secluded, they have been unsuccessful."]{.underline}** The US
released more photographs on Monday to support its claims that [Iran was
responsible for
attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/mike-pompeo-iran-gulf-oil-tanker-attacks)
on commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman. One of the pictures appeared
to show in colour and sharper focus an incident that had [previously
been
presented](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/mike-pompeo-iran-gulf-oil-tanker-attacks)
in a grainy black and white video -- a patrol boat with black-uniformed
sailors alongside one of the tankers, the Kokuka Courageous. A statement
accompanying the images said the incident was filmed from a US
helicopter and occurred after blasts had hobbled the two ships on 13
June. The crew of the Kokuka Courageous had spotted an unexploded mine
on the hull and abandoned ship. "Later that day, an Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Gashti Class patrol boat approached
Kokuka Courageous and was observed and recorded by a US navy MH-60R
helicopter removing the unexploded limpet mine from Kokuka Courageous,"
said the statement issued by US Central Command. "Iran is responsible
for the attack based on video evidence and the resources and proficiency
needed to quickly remove the unexploded limpet mine." The statement does
not make any claim on why the Iranians removed the mine, for example in
an attempt to remove evidence. The US has not presented any evidence of
mines being attached, and the head of the company operating the Kokuka
Courageous, Yukata Katada, has said the crew had reported that the ship
[was attacked by a "flying
object"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/world/middleeast/oil-tanker-attack-gulf-oman.html).
On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, [Mike
Pompeo](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pompeo), is also due to
visit the Florida headquarters of US Central Command (in charge of all
operations in the Middle East) and US special forces. It is unusual for
a secretary of state to visit military headquarters, especially as the
acting defence secretary is reported to be staying in Washington. Pompeo
has taken the lead role in the administration's campaign of "maximum
pressure" on Iran, since the US withdrawal from a multilateral nuclear
deal in May last year. Tehran on Monday announced it would soon breach
limits on how much enriched uranium it can stockpile under the nuclear
deal. The accord, which was brokered by Barack Obama and which Iran and
the other signatories have maintained following Trump's withdrawal, caps
Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium at 300kg enriched to 3.67%. But
Iran said it had quadrupled the rate of enrichment, so that in 10 days
it would bypass the 300kg limit. A spokesman for the White House
national security council said this amounted to "nuclear blackmail".
Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the state department, told reporters
on Monday: "We continue to call on the Iranian regime not to obtain a
nuclear weapon, to abide by their commitments to the international
community. "It's unfortunate that they have made this announcement
today. It doesn't surprise anybody and this is why the president has
often said that the JCPOA \[joint comprehensive plan of action\] needs
to be replaced with a better deal." The US decision to pull out, and
Trump's "America first" approach to foreign policy, appears to have
damaged trust with allies, some of whom are seeking stronger proof that
Iran was behind the oil tanker attacks. Critics accuse the Trump
administration of manufacturing a crisis. Ben Rhodes, former national
security adviser to Barack Obama,
[tweeted:](https://twitter.com/brhodes/status/1140748609023041537)
"Trump pulling out of the Iran deal has led directly and predictably to
the Iranian nuclear threat getting worse and the risk of war going up."
On Tuesday, China urged restraint, saying the US risked "opening a
Pandora's box" in the Middle East. State councillor Wang Yi said "the US
side should alter its extreme pressure methods. Any unilateral behaviour
has no basis in international law," and warned it could create "an even
greater crisis". Wang also urged Iran not to abandon the nuclear deal.

#### The Saudis aren't great morally but they're better than ceding regional influence to Iran

**[Doran,]{.underline}** Michael **[18]{.underline}** \[Senior fellow at
the Hudson Institute\]. "Trump Is Crude. But He's Right About Saudi
Arabia." New York Times, Nov 21, 2018. https://www.nytimes.com/
2018/11/21/opinion/trump-saudi-arabia-khashoggi.html

[Notably absent from Ms. Power's list of evildoers, however, are Iran
and its proxies.]{.underline} The omission is telling. As part of its
pivot toward Iran and away from the Sunni states and Israel, the Obama
administration turned a blind eye to the slaughter in Syria that Moscow,
Tehran and its proxies unleashed, and, thanks to the nuclear deal,
delivered countless billions to the Iranian war machine. [His critics
would say that Mr. Trump is now similarly emboldening a reckless Saudi
regime. This is a false analogy. The Saudis are not the moral
equivalents of Iranians and the Russians. The kingdom has sheltered
comfortably for over 75 years under the American security umbrella,
which the United States happily extended not least because the Saudis
and their oil have played a pivotal role in American economic
strategies. Mr. Trump's statement acknowledged that the Saudis are
assisting him with stabilizing global oil prices as he seeks to quash
Iranian oil sales.]{.underline} Whatever Prince Mohammed's faults may
be, he actively supports the American regional order that the Iranians
openly seek to destroy.

#### Ending arms sales and sanctioning MBS is the worst option -- it either causes MBS to just turn to Russia and China to get the same weapons, King Salman to appoint an unstable new leader with no legitimacy, or external actors to overthrow the Saudi government and start a civil war

**[Doran]{.underline}**, Michael. **[18]{.underline}** \[Senior fellow
at the Hudson Institute\]. "Trump Is Crude. But He's Right About Saudi
Arabia." New York Times, Nov 21, 2018. https://www.nytimes.com/
2018/11/21/opinion/trump-saudi-arabia-khashoggi.html

[Mr. Trump's critics are asking us to believe that the priority for
stabilizing the Middle East today is distancing the United States from
one of its oldest allies and instead working to achieve a balance of
power between Riyadh and Tehran.]{.underline} The Saudis, they claim,
need us far more than we need them. This is a dangerous assumption that
is not born out by experience. [In recent years all of America's allies,
from Mr. Sisi in Egypt to Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey to Benjamin
Netanyahu in Israel, have begun spending as much time in Moscow as in
Washington. Why would we think the Saudis might not also seek protection
from Russia if they are shunned by America? Instead of standing with the
Saudis, Mr. Trump's critics call for, as Senator Lindsey Graham recently
did, sanctions that would persuade King Salman to appoint a new crown
prince.]{.underline} But King Salman is not the de facto ruler of Saudi
Arabia; Prince Mohammed is. A policy that seeks to change the king's
mind is based on a delusion that is far more deranged than anything in
Mr. Trump's statement. Let's imagine Mr. Trump's critics get their wish.
A replacement crown prince who rose to power under pressure of sanctions
would be severely weakened, if not entirely illegitimate. This would
serve only to validate Al Qaeda's anti-Saudi ideology, which depicts the
royal family as American stooges. Would a compromised crown prince be a
more reliable partner for the United States in stabilizing the Middle
East? [In all likelihood, sanctions would simply embitter Prince
Mohammed, who would respond by tacking toward Russia and China. The
United States could console itself by celebrating its staunch commitment
to principle, but its influence would diminish considerably. Less likely
but worth keeping in mind is the worst-case scenario.]{.underline}
Prince Mohammed's enemies, inside and outside the kingdom, are numerous,
and American sanctions on him would put a target on his back. In a
violent succession battle, what horrific forces would be unleashed?
Outside actors, such as Iran and Russia, coveting control of the
kingdom's oil wealth and influence over the Islamic holy cities, would
rush in. The United States would find itself embroiled in another civil
war as in Syria. In either scenario, Iran would rejoice. [Critics of Mr.
Trump's Saudi policy are already demanding that the United States
pressure the kingdom to end the war in Yemen without so much as
mentioning the need to ensure that the country does not become another
base, like Lebanon, for Iran. The murder of Mr. Khashoggi was a brutal
and grotesque act. The United States has registered its feelings loudly
and clearly by putting sanctions on the 17 men who were directly
involved in the killing. Punishing the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia
will not bring justice for Mr. Khashoggi, nor will it make Saudi Arabia
a more dependable ally. It will simply diminish the influence of the
United States and embolden its enemies]{.underline}

#### Arms sales are key to deterring Iran

**[Thompson,]{.underline}** Loren. **[10]{.underline}** \[CEO of the
Lexington Institute\]. "Is Big Saudi Arms Sale a Good Idea?". Council on
Foreign Relations, 2010.
https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/bigsaudi-arms-sale-good-idea

[Congress will closely scrutinize the proposed arms deal with Saudi
Arabia to make sure it does not threaten Israel or otherwise destabilize
the region. The package appears to be a careful reconciliation of Saudi
requirements with Israeli fears, while also offering a strategic balance
against Iran.]{.underline} The biggest component of the transaction
involves new and refurbished F-15 fighters, which are designed for both
air dominance and attack of ground targets. The fighter sale could have
been a serious problem for Israel if Saudi Arabia had been offered
stealthy F-22s or F-35s, because those aircraft would have been suitable
for executing a surprise attack. The F-15 is not stealthy, and although
its movements can be masked through the skillful application of tactics
and electronic-warfare technology, Israeli defenders should have no
difficulty detecting any threatening moves. "[I see little danger to
Israel in the proposed transaction. For Iran, though, the transaction
presents a powerful deterrent since there is nothing in Teheran's
current arsenal that can cope with the latest versions of the F-15
fighter or the AH-64 attack helicopter." The helicopters included in the
package are among the most capable in the world, but they could be
easily repulsed by Israeli tactical aircraft if ever dispatched against
the Jewish state.]{.underline} Thus, I see little danger to Israel in
the proposed transaction. For Iran, though, the transaction presents a
powerful deterrent since there is nothing in Tehran's current arsenal
that can cope with the latest versions of the F-15 fighter or the AH-64
attack helicopter. The radical Shiite regime in Iran constitutes the
most serious military threat to Saudi Arabia, so I expect that the
pending arms sale will be followed by additional agreements to modernize
the Saudi Eastern Fleet in the Gulf and upgrade missile defenses. [If
Congress delays or modifies the proposed transaction, the Saudi
government will probably move to purchase modern weapons from other
sources such as Britain or France. The kingdom needs to replace its
aging Cold War arsenal, and it is surrounded by nations potentially
posing a threat to its security. Little purpose would be served by
declining to assist Saudi Arabia in meeting its legitimate defensive
needs. Whatever the differences may be between our governments and
cultures, the Saudis have been reliable allies of America for decades
and have exercised a moderating influence on the behavior of other
oil-producing states. Helping them means helping ourselves.]{.underline}

#### Status quo negotiations on Yemen are making historic progress -- 

**[Gelardi]{.underline}**, Chris. **[18]{.underline}** \[Writer for The
Nation\]. "Hesitant Hope for the Fate of Yemen". The Nation, Dec 20,
2018.
https://www.thenation.com/article/yemen-ceasefire-breakthroughcongress-war-powers/

For much of the past year, as desperation reached new heights in Yemen,
the gulf between these realities widened. In November 2017, [Saudi
Arabia, a major player in the conflict, made a strategic decision to
tighten its stranglehold on the country, further restricting civilian
access to food and aid; a year later, in November 2018, Yemen likely had
its deadliest month of the war. But over the past few weeks, much of
that changed.]{.underline} In an opportune coincidence, parties to
Yemen's conflict convened on Capitol Hill and in a castle in
Sweden---and in a matter of days, the military and geopolitical
conditions were realigned, allowing room for hope. Now Yemen's war is at
a critical moment, and the fate of 28 million people hangs in the
balance. BREAKING THROUGH TO THE WARRING PARTIES On December 6, in
Rimbo, Sweden, the United Nations special envoy for Yemen, Martin
Griffiths, began a week-long process of shuttling back and forth between
meetings with representatives from Yemen's two main warring parties. [It
was the first time a mediator had successfully brought officials from
the internationally recognized government and the rebel movement known
as the Houthis to the negotiating table since 2016, and, surprisingly,
they embraced each other warmly---with kisses, smiles, and photo ops.
These awkward pleasantries alone were critical symbolic victories. But
in war and peace, symbolic victories are only as meaningful as the
material victories they beget.]{.underline} The agenda was ambitious.
Heading into the negotiations, Griffiths had a list of goals that would
build confidence between the parties, provide much-needed relief to ill
and starving civilians, and ultimately lay the groundwork for future
efforts to establish peace. The grand prize was the final goal: the
revitalization--- most likely via some kind of UN takeover---of Yemen's
main port in the city of Hodeida, where about three-quarters of the
country's food normally enters. Though the Houthis have controlled the
port since 2014, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, intervening on behalf of the Yemeni government, has
imposed a suffocating naval blockade---a main driver of the humanitarian
crisis---and ground troops have been preparing to launch a third bloody
assault on the city. [Leading up to the talks, most Yemen analysts were
careful not to overpromise, and some were down right fatalistic.
Considering the failure of past negotiations---and the Houthis' tendency
to renege on promises---significant steps toward humanitarian relief and
peace seemed far off.]{.underline} "Unfortunately, the odds are high
that the consultations will break down amid mutual recriminations, as
has happened during all previous rounds," Peter Salisbury, a Yemen
analyst, wrote for the International Crisis Group. But somehow Griffiths
fostered an atmosphere of good faith in Sweden. [In addition to smiles
and handshakes, the negotiations kicked off with word of a
"confidence-building" prisoner swap---at first about 5,000 people were
to be released, but by the end of the talks, the government and the
Houthis agreed to release more than 16,000 fighters, teachers, tribal
and religious leaders, and even children.]{.underline} Then, after some
intense back and forth, the two sides agreed to reopen the country's
largest airport, thus reestablishing a crucial channel for aid. [With
these positive developments, pessimism seemed to melt away over the
course of negotiations, and the grand prize---a Hodeida
agreement---appeared to be within reach.]{.underline}

#### US-Saudi relations are key to solve Yemen, push back on Iranian nuclearization and regional hegemony -- absent a strong alliance, a weaker Saudi Arabia creates a regional power vacuum filled by groups acting against US interests

[Of course, the fallout from any kind of punitive actions against Riyadh
from Washington would be cataclysmic for stability in the already
turbulent middle east. It would effectively see Washington not only have
sanctions in place against Saudi regional arch rival Iran but also
against longtime ally Saudi Arabia itself - perhaps an unprecedented
situation in terms of geopolitical and diplomatic dysfunction. It would
also strain U.S.- Saudi ties, complicate matters in Syria and Yemen and
in joint efforts to reign in Iran's nuclear development plans, ballistic
missile program and regional hegemony ambitions]{.underline}. In short,
what an infuriated U.S. Congress should take into account before it
forces President Trump's hand over any punitive actions against Riyadh
is the end game. How could this play out over the next few years in both
oil markets, global economic growth and even American national security?
[Without a strong U.S.-Saudi alliance, a power vacuum will open up in
the Middle East that a host of players, mostly with nefarious ambitious,
will seek to fill.]{.underline}

#### US military support to gulf states is the only thing stopping prolif -- assurance is key

Deterrence%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20U.S.-GCC%20Def%20Cooperation_DCP2015-U-010969-Final.pdf?sequence=1

[This is a potential problem for the United States.]{.underline} As the
closest Western ally to the GCC and the security guarantor of the
Persian Gulf, the United States is considered to be the only viable
counterweight to Iran's ambitions. [With the pivot to Asia and a
potential nuclear deal with Iran, Gulf Arab states are uncertain about
America's commitment to their security. That general sense of insecurity
is what might propel some Gulf Arab states toward pursuing their own
nuclear enrichment and/or weapons programs in response to the
Iranians.]{.underline} Preventing nuclear proliferation in the Middle
East is of course a major motivation for the P5+1's proposed deal with
Iran. However, because Gulf Arab states largely do not view a deal that
would allow Iran to retain any enrichment capability as sufficient, it
is possible that a deal will not adequately address the GCC's concerns.∂
In order to assuage GCC fears and prevent nuclear proliferation, the
United States needs to have a clear view of its Gulf allies' security
concerns and their perspectives on potential options to address those
concerns. The GCC will continue to consider the United States the
backbone of their deterrence efforts. [However, as dynamics in the
region change, so too might what is required to provide assurance.
Providing adequate assurance to GCC states will be the foundation for
any effort to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region. Although the
GCC states might harbor unrealistic expectations of their defense ties
to the United States, there might be options acceptable to both
Washington and its Gulf allies that could mitigate their concerns and
obviate any potential reactionary nuclear proliferation.]{.underline}

#### Iran is bluffing to fuck with Trump

**[Cole 19]{.underline}** Juan Cole, 6-23-2019, \"Dear Trump: Iran
doesn\'t Have a Military Nuclear Program and Gave up Bomb-Making
Potential,\" Informed Comment,
[https://www.juancole.com/2019/06/military-nuclear-potential.html
//](https://www.juancole.com/2019/06/military-nuclear-potential.html%20//)ALiang

Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) -- Julian Borger at The Guardian reports
that Trump said Saturday to reporters, "**[They're not going to have a
nuclear weapon. We're not going to have Iran have a nuclear
weapon.]{.underline}** When they agree to that, they're going to have a
wealthy country. They're going to be so happy, and I'm going to be their
best friend. I hope that happens."

**[Trump can't get the conservative script right to save his life. The
argument warmongers made for breaching the 2015 Iran nuclear
deal]{.underline}** (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) was
that it did not address a range of Iranian behavior beyond nuclear
matters, such as its military intervention in Syria or (they allege)
Yemen, or its ongoing work on ballistic missiles, or its support for
Hizbullah in Lebanon.

Few argued that the JCPOA was useless in deterring Iran from making a
nuclear weapon. Some worried about a 15 year sunset provision to the
deal, but it was envisioned the UN inspections would continue.

**[Trump is now citing Iran's non-existent bomb-making as the reason for
his breach of the treaty and not mentioning any of the things the hawks
mind.]{.underline}**

**[Iran isn't making a bomb and gave up 80% of its civilian nuclear
enrichment program in the JCPOA.]{.underline}**

In fact, **[there have been no US intelligence assessments that Iran had
decided to try to make a bomb since Tehran admitted in early 2003 that
it had an enrichment program]{.underline}** (it was supposed to report
the program to the UN under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
which Iran had signed).

Uranium comes in nature in two isotopes, U-238 (very common and
relatively inert) and U-235 (rarer and much more volatile). **[In order
to use uranium to fuel a nuclear reactor, it has to be enriched to
roughly 3.5% of U-235. If it is enriched to 95% U-235, it can be made to
blow up in a nuclear explosion,]{.underline}** as the US did at
Hiroshima in 1945.

Iran knows how to enrich uranium, but has never enriched to levels above
what is considered "Low Enriched Uranium." The cut-off is above 20%
U-235. It has a medical reactor that uses 19.5% enriched uranium.

Although the US CIA has not assessed that Iran has during the past
decade and a half had a nuclear weapons program, its civilian enrichment
capacities were potentially dual use, so that there was always a chance
Tehran might decide to militarize.

I can't get anybody to believe me on this, but Iran is a Shiite
theocracy led by an Ayatollah, and Ali Khamenei has given several fatwas
(fatwas or considered legal rulings can be oral) in which he has
forbidden the making, stockpiling or use of nuclear weapons. Khamenei
rules according to Islamic law, which disallows the deliberate
infliction of mass casualties on civilian noncombatants in war. Nuclear
weapons obviously target the populations of whole cities and so the
ayatollahs consider them tools of Satan.

On the other hand**[, having the world know that you could whip up a
nuclear bomb in short order is a form of deterrence against
invasion.]{.underline}** Japan has that capability. Iran probably had
that capability before 2015.

The 2015 agreement attempted to forestall any move by Iran to develop a
nuclear weapons enrichment program (again, it has never done so and says
it never would).

Still, for the suspicious, the JCPOA took away the option of quick
militarization with four steps:

1\. Regular UN inspections of sites for signatures of high-enriched
uranium or for plutonium

**[2. Reduction of number of centrifuges to 6,000, which would take a
year to make bomb-grade uranium even if they were turned to that
purpose]{.underline}**

3\. The bricking in and abandonment of a proposed heavy water nuclear
reactor at Arak. Heavy water reactors can accumulate fissile material
for a bomb faster and easier than light water reactors, so Obama and the
UN team insisted on this step for Iran.

4**[. The stockpiles of low-enriched-Uranium (LEU) built up for the
medical reactor]{.underline}** (and which had come to much exceed the
actual needs of that reactor) **[were cast in a form that prevented
further enrichment, and much of it was exported.]{.underline}**

Under these circumstances, **[there is no way Iran can make a bomb
without everybody knowing it is trying]{.underline}**. It would have to
kick out the UN inspectors, build thousands more centrifuges under the
gaze of US satellites, etc., etc.

**[So if what Trump wanted was no Iranian nuke, he had that when he was
sworn into office in 2017. By breaching the treaty and refusing to
reward Iran's good behavior by ceasing sanctions, Trump put the US on a
war footing with Iran.]{.underline}**

He has stopped Iran from selling its oil, a form of blockade that
probably amounts to an act of war. He is also stopping European concerns
from investing in Iran.

It is frustrating that Trump is dancing on the brink of a war for a
purpose that had already been attained. This is why it is bad to elect
people to high office who have mental health problems.

#### Iran doesn't have nuclear capabilities but wants to drive wedge between US and allies 

**[Crowley 19]{.underline}** Michael Crowley, 6-17-2019, \"The Iran
Crisis, Explained,\" No Publication,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-uranium.html?login=smartlock&auth=login-smartlock>
//ALiang

The agreement was an important part of Mr. Obama's foreign policy
legacy, and Mr. Trump has seemed to take particular relish in
overturning it. Mr. Obama believed the deal could be a step toward
empowering moderates within Iran's government and softening bitter
relations with the West. Trump administration officials argue that
Iran's government will respond only to "maximum pressure."

**[How much closer to a nuclear bomb could Iran get?]{.underline}**

It depends. Before the nuclear deal, Iran had a "breakout time" of just
weeks before it had the capability to build a nuclear weapon, Obama
administration officials said.

But that is **[a theoretical timeline describing how long it would take
Iran to enrich enough uranium for one bomb. It remains unclear whether
Iran has the technical capability to construct a nuclear weapon, much
less fit it onto a ballistic missile for delivery]{.underline}**. Iran
currently has a missile that could strike most of the Middle East and
some of Europe, though not the U.S.

What does Iran want?

**[It is possible that Iran is beginning a sprint to constructing a
nuclear bomb, although that would be exceedingly dangerous, with a
military response expected from the United States and perhaps
Israel]{.underline}**. In the near term, **[Iran is probably trying to
drive a wedge between the Trump administration and European allies in
hope of finding relief from the sanctions that are constricting its
economy]{.underline}**.

Ideally, **[Iran would like Mr. Trump to reverse the severe pressure he
has imposed on its economy since he abandoned the nuclear deal last
year.]{.underline}** That includes American demands that other nations
halt their purchase of Iranian oil --- the country's main source of
revenue --- and that they choose between doing business with Iran or
with the United States.

Such a reversal is unlikely for now. So **[Iran is hoping that other
parties to the nuclear deal, which are eager to avert an international
crisis and possible military conflict, will resist the American pressure
and find ways to do business with Tehran]{.underline}**.

One option is a kind of barter system designed by Britain, Germany and
France that would allow European nations to trade with Iran without
using the dollar and triggering American economic reprisals. But the
system has major
inherent [limitations](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/world/europe/europe-trade-iran-nuclear-deal.html?module=inline).

Iran may also
be [betting](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/opinion/iran-america-crisis.html?module=inline) that
Mr. Trump, who has been critical of past American entanglements in the
Middle East, does not want a conflict, and that an escalation of
tensions could draw him into negotiations.

**[Saudi Arabia's King Salman has called for international action to
stop \"escalations\" in Iran]{.underline}** following attacks on Gulf
oil assets. He was speaking at the **[start of an emergency Arab summit
in the holy city of Mecca, following a spike in tensions between the two
countries]{.underline}**. The right of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates to defend their interests after the attacks on oil pumping
stations in the kingdom and tankers off the UAE were supported in a Gulf
Arab statement and a separate communique issued after the wider summit.
Tehran denies any involvement in the attacks and in a sign of regional
tensions, Iraq, which has good ties with neighbouring Iran and
Washington, said it objected to the Arab communique, which stated that
any cooperation with Tehran should be based on \"non-interference in
other countries\". \"The absence of a firm deterrent stance against
Iranian behaviour is what led to the escalation we see today,\" King
Salman told the two consecutive meetings late on Thursday. The ruler of
the world\'s top crude exporter said Shi\'ite Iran\'s development of
nuclear and missile capabilities and its threats on world oil supplies
posed a risk to regional and global security. U.S. national security
adviser John Bolton said on Thursday that evidence of Iran being behind
the tanker attacks would be presented to the U.N. Security Council as
early as next week. \"The kingdom is keen to preserve the stability and
security of the region, to spare it the scourge of war and to realise
peace and stability,\" King Salman said. Iran, which is locked in
several proxy wars with Saudi Arabia in the region, rejected what it
called \"baseless\" accusations made at the summit, Iranian state news
agency IRNA reported. \"We see the Saudi effort to mobilise (regional)
opinion as part of the hopeless process followed by America and the
Zionist regime (Israel) against Iran,\" IRNA quoted Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying.

### AQAP 

#### Infrastructure destruction from Yemen war has AQAP disorganized eliminating potential terror threat

**[Johnsen 18]{.underline}** Gregory D. Johnsen, 8-7-2018, \"Al-Qaeda
and ISIS are on Their Heels in Yemen, But Will Return Unless We Help
Build a Lasting Peace,\" Just Security,
<https://www.justsecurity.org/60099/al-qaeda-isis-heels-yemen-return-lasting-peace/>/ALiang

It was the sort of scene that has become ubiquitous across the Middle
East. A small convoy of vehicles, packed with armed men, approach a
rickety checkpoint manned by another group of armed men. The cars refuse
to stop, a shot is fired, and a gun battle ensues.

That is exactly what happened a few weeks ago in Yemen. Only this time,
the men in the vehicles were members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula (AQAP) and the checkpoint was manned by ISIS. That battle and
a second, longer one that followed a day later marked the first time in
more than four years that the two groups in Yemen have come into direct
conflict with one another. It is also another in a growing list of
indicators suggesting that, like much of the country, Yemen's jihadi
world is breaking apart.

**[AQAP is weaker now than it has been at any point since it was formed
in 2009.]{.underline}** ISIS, which enjoyed a brief moment of ascendancy
in Yemen, is down to a few training camps and a dwindling number of
fighters.

That is good, if fairly surprising news. After all, **[wars are supposed
to be good for terrorists, the messier the better. And Yemen's war has
been among the world's ugliest: large numbers of civilian casualties,
cholera outbreaks, proxy forces, assassinations, torture, starvation and
allegations of state-sanctioned sexual abuse.]{.underline}**

Initially at least, things played out as expected. AQAP took advantage
of the collapse of the central government in early 2015 to seize
al-Mukalla, the country's fifth largest city, which they ruled for a
year, pocketing millions of dollars in the process. But in April 2016,
ahead of a joint Yemeni-UAE offensive, AQAP withdrew from the city
instead of staying behind to fight. (A recent investigation by the
Associated Press suggests that AQAP withdrew as part of a deal with the
UAE.)

That same year, the Obama administration's last, the US carried out more
than 30 drone strikes on suspected AQAP targets. The next year, under
the Trump administration the number of strikes would more than quadruple
to over 130. But it is more than just the drone strikes, as devastating
as those have been, that has brought AQAP and ISIS to their lowest point
in years. It has been the war itself.

**[Yemen is too chaotic, too confusing, and has too many battlefronts
for even groups like AQAP and ISIS to manage. They are fighting all
sides in this war: the Houthis, the Yemeni government, the Saudis, the
UAE, the US and, as of a few weeks ago, each other]{.underline}**. What
this means in practice is that **[both AQAP and ISIS are fighting
multiple wars at once.]{.underline}** And they are paying a price. What
happens in one part of the country against one particular enemy does not
necessarily reflect what is happening in another part of the country
against another enemy.

With electronic communications increasingly dangerous -- AQAP has
released multiple public service announcements, jihadi versions of
"loose lips sink ships" -- both sides rely on courier-carried messages.
**[But the break-up of the country and the proliferation of checkpoints,
such as the one that sparked the AQAP-ISIS clash, has made even this
style of communication difficult.]{.underline}**

Key leaders and commanders can no longer communicate quickly or
effectively with their troops in the field. Messaging and media, an
important part of each group's platform, take longer to coordinate and,
at times over the past year, have seemed almost contradictory. One
al-Qaeda group in one part of Yemen might say one thing, while another
al-Qaeda group in another part of Yemen is saying something else.

**[The result of all this chaos and confusion has been fragmentation and
freelancing, local fighters taking matters into their own hands with
less and less instruction from the central leadership of each group.
This fracturing of command is what led to the recent fight between AQAP
and ISIS.]{.underline}**

The two groups have lived side by side in al-Baydha, the central Yemeni
governorate where the clash took place, for years, often placing their
camps right next to one another. And while there was periodic sniping
back and forth through their respective media wings, or defectors from
one side joining the other, that was as far as it went. In Yemen,
al-Qaeda and ISIS had what amounted to a tacit non-aggression pact.
**[They called each other names, they excommunicated one another, but
they didn't fight.]{.underline}**

That is no longer the case. **[Yemen's two main jihadi groups are on
their heels and at each other's throats]{.underline}**. But as welcome
as that may be, it is unlikely to last. Just as the current war in Yemen
has fractured AQAP and ISIS so too will its eventual end reinvigorate
them.

**[The war has been too brutal and too sectarian for a tidy aftermath.
Too many individuals have been radicalized to the point that they won't
simply lay down their arms when the fighting is over.]{.underline}**
They'll keep going and al-Qaeda and ISIS will be there to welcome them.
This has happened before. Most notably, in Iraq after the U.S. withdrew
in 2011. But it doesn't have to happen this time.

AQAP and ISIS are vulnerable in Yemen in a way they've never been
before. **[The U.S. should do everything in its power to continue to
decimate these organizations while simultaneously pushing for a quick
end to this war]{.underline}**. But it should do so with the idea that
as soon as the fighting stops the U.S. will lead the way with
development aid and help to stitch the country back together again. This
will not be easy and it will not be quick. But U.S. has to deal with
both the immediate threat and the future threat, rollback the AQAP and
ISIS that exist today while also preventing new recruits from joining
tomorrow. Because if it fails on either count AQAP and ISIS will
resurrect themselves in Yemen and when they do they'll be a lot stronger
than they are at the moment.

#### SQ UAE antiterror operations checks AQAP

**[Al Qaeda in Yemen is weaker than it has ever been as the UAE's
military training and counterterrorism operation continue to battle the
terrorist entity in the countr]{.underline}**y, Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Dr Anwar Gargash told reporters on Monday. Mr Gargash
said the **[UAE's fight against Al Qaeda in Yemen -- also known as AQAP
-- represents the country's wider policy towards the
region.]{.underline}** "Our fight with regards to extremism and
terrorism is basically at the core of foreign policy, and for us, we
don't look at this simply as a Yemen issue, because the issue of
terrorism is a major problem not only in the Arab world but beyond," he
said**[. The UAE continues to work on the ground with Yemenis to help
eliminate terrorist strongholds but has limited its presence on the
front lines]{.underline}**, instead **[it hands responsibility to
UAE-trained local military units.]{.underline}** The country intervened,
as part of the Arab coalition, on behalf of the internationally
recognised government of Abdrabu Mansur Hadi to fight the Iran-backed
rebels. **[The Houthi insurgency in 2014 and 2015 allowed AQAP to fill a
power vacuum and gain ground in the east of the country.]{.underline}**
Brig Gen Musallam Al Rashedi said on Monday that despite gains**[, the
battle against Al Qaeda in Yemen required the continued support of the
Yemeni people.]{.underline}** Brig Gen Al Rashedi commanded the UAE
special operation task force in 2015 and 2016. Emirati Armed Forces
Brigadier General Musallam Al Rashedi addresses journalists about the
situation in Yemen AFP "You can't kill your way to victory against AQAP
in Yemen with drones and raids, the secret to winning is in the hearts
and minds of the people of Yemen that will allow us to win this
forever", he said during a press briefing in Dubai on Monday. **[The
UAE, as part of the Arab Coalition and in coordination with the US, has
trained approximately 60,000 Yemeni fighters to battle the terrorist
group. They are able to combine local knowledge and methods with
counterterrorism strategy]{.underline}**. By **[training tribes and
militias who are local to areas where the terrorist insurgency has the
most influence, the UAE has been able to implement a counterterrorism
programme that has proved more effective]{.underline}**, the official
said. The **[task force has killed around 1,000 core members of AQAP,
including 13 out of the 18 most wanted leaders. He said the terrorist
organisation is so compromised that it is unable to export its ideology
to the region]{.underline}**, let alone maintain its presence in Yemen.
"We are denying them the oxygen, so to speak, to exist. Most importantly
for everyone outside Yemen, we have hampered their ability to export
terrorism, they can't go anywhere to conduct their operations," Brig Gen
Al Rashedi said. **[The UAE's counterterrorism goal]{.underline}**, the
officer said, **[was not only to cut off supply routes and recapture
strongholds but to maintain control of those areas and prevent militants
returning]{.underline}**. "They key is to have the Yemenis do it
themselves, we can't stay in the long haul in Yemen, they won't do it if
we don't win their hearts and minds, at the grassroots and government
level, they have to step up and do it,\" he said. AQAP's presence in the
Arab world's poorest country, has resurfaced twice in the last ten
years, and both in response to political instability**[. Elite Yemeni
forces hit AQAP fighters near Shabwa In Yemen's Bayda, tribal fighters
are out for revenge against the Houthis Mr Gargash, echoed the
sentiment, saying the UAE backs a political solution in Yemen, which
will be pursued during peace talks in Geneva on September
6]{.underline}**. But he remains apprehensive on the Houthis intent,
saying they are likely to hamper any efforts. "We still believe the main
obstacle to a political solution is the Houthis, they have undermined
all the previous initiatives by refusing to pull-out of militias and
heavy weapons from urban centres to start the political process," Mr
Gargash said. **[The UAE and the Arab Coalition recently ceased its
military offensive on Hodeidah, a strategically important city still
under rebel control, to allow UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths to
negotiate a settlement]{.underline}**. The Arab Coalition says it
adhered to the ceasefire in part to support the political process, which
continues to be their ultimate goal, but also to limit the humanitarian
cost of the battle in Yemen's largest port city. More than 600,000
residents remain in the Red Sea city where men have been forcibly
conscripted by the Iran-backed rebels or coerced to cooperate with the
Houthis. According to Mr Gargash, the Houthis used the ceasefire to
further entrench themselves in the port city by digging trenches and
deploying militias among the civilian population. He said the
coalition's approach to the offensive, "was sensitive, and I would say
at our own cost. "We could have done this very quickly in terms of a
quick operation, but we understood this is a population of 600,000 and
we are not going to be drawn into a street to street fight," the
minister said. The UAE continues to apply pressure on Hodeidah,
believing that further compromising the Houthis position will bring
better results in the peace talks. Mr Gargash said that the humanitarian
toll of the civil war has always been a heavy factor in weighing up
battle scenarios. He said civilian affected by fighting was "an
unfortunate burden of war. "I accept the coalition is criticized for
some of the humanitarian weights of this war, but all parties need to
accept their part in what we are doing today. Having said that, we are
doing what we can to support the humanitarian's situation in Yemen," he
said. The minister also urged international organisations and media to
look at the Houthis as well. "I also urge various friends and NGOs and
others in the international community to scrutinize the details of the
Houthis as well not just the coalition, look at the million mines
planted by the Houthis, look at the large mobilization of child
soldiers, look at the indiscriminate attack on Saudi cities," he said.
Although he didn't explicitly touch on the incident, the coalition
received heavy criticism last week after an airstrike in the Saada area
of north Yemen caused a number of civilian casualties, including of
children. At the time, coalition spokesman Col Turki Al Malki said that
the attack in Saada was launched against Houthi rebels responsible for
firing a missile at the southern Saudi city of Jazan the previous day.
The coalition referred the incident to its special investigative panel
soon after the reports by relief organisations working in Yemen, an
official told the Saudi Press Agency said Saturday.

### Yemen

#### Ceasefire is going into place and the senate has already voted to end US support of the Saudi coalition

**[Gelardi]{.underline}**, Chris. **[18]{.underline}** \[Writer for The
Nation\]. "Hesitant Hope for the Fate of Yemen". The Nation, Dec 20,
2018.

[Though a few lawmakers have railed against US support for the Saudi-led
coalition from the start of its intervention, it was two and a half
years before someone took concrete action. In September 2017, and again
in September 2018, freshman Democratic representative Ro Khanna
introduced legislation invoking the War Powers Resolution---a 1973 act
asserting Congress's exclusive power to authorize military action---to
compel Trump to end US support for the coalition]{.underline}. In both
cases, it was quashed in the House---first by both the Republican and
Democratic leadership, then just by the Republicans---before it had a
chance to make it to the floor for debate. And in the Senate, efforts
from the cross-partisan trio of Bernie Sanders (I), Chris Murphy (D),
and Mike Lee (R) met a similar fate in March. Apparently Congress didn't
think addressing the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe was
important enough to run the risk of damaging US relations with Saudi
Arabia. But then came a breakthrough: [When it became clear to the
world---particularly to Congress---that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered
the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi
consulate in Istanbul on October 2, everything about the US relationship
with Saudi Arabia, including the situation in Yemen, was called into
question]{.underline}. Taking advantage of the moment, Sanders revived
his tabled War Powers legislation, and on November 28, the Senate voted
by a wide margin---63 to 37---to move forward with a debate. [For the
first time, there was a viable route to ending US involvement in
Yemen]{.underline}. MEASURED OPTIMISM On December 13, the sagas in both
Washington and Sweden reached their climaxes. First, Griffiths, the UN
envoy, announced that he had successfully brokered a cease-fire for
Hodeida. Both government/coalition and Houthi fighters agreed to
withdraw from the city, and international monitors were arranged to
facilitate the revitalization of the port and ensure that both sides
were adhering to the agreement. [Then, after fending off procedural
attacks and amendment proposals, 56 US senators, including six
Republicans, voted to pass the Sanders-Murphy-Lee legislation aimed at
compelling President Trump to end US support for the Saudi-led
coalition. It was the first affirmative vote invoking the War Powers
Resolution in its 45-year history. The word "historic" has been thrown
around a lot in recent days. The signing of the Hodeida truce was
"historic." Handshakes between government and Houthi officials were
"historic." The Senate held a "historic vote" on a "historic
resolution." These statements are all undoubtedly true, insofar as
"historic" means pertinent to history.]{.underline}

[Senior U.S. officials have gone further than ever before in calling for
an end to the Saudiled war in Yemen --- a conflict that has pushed 14
million people to the brink of starvation]{.underline}. "Coalition
airstrikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen," Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo said last Tuesday. The same day, Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis said all sides needed to take meaningful steps toward a
cease-fire and begin negotiations in the next 30 days. The comments
raised the prospect that the Trump administration is getting tougher
with the Saudis over their military campaign against Iran-linked Houthi
rebels, which has killed more than 10,000 people in the desperately poor
country since 2015. All sides have been accused of violating
international law and committing war crimes. [A girl suffering from

Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates, through billions in
arms sales. It also refuels their jets mid-air, provides training and
shares intelligence.]{.underline} [So if the U.S. wants to try to force
the Saudis' hands, it has leverage. The best way to force the Saudis to
change their ways is to stop sending weapons, according to Human Rights
Watch's Yemen researcher Kristine Beckerle. "You've gotten so many
violations already over the past three and a half years, so what Pompeo
and Mattis should be doing is saying, 'These are the
benchmarks]{.underline}. We're going to hold up weapons sales until you
actually fulfill these tasks,'" she said, referring to the apparent
bombing of civilian sites by the coalition. American arms deliveries to
the Saudis reached \$5.5 billion last year, up from \$1.7 billion in
2009, according to the U.K.-based Campaign Against Arms Trade which
compiled the figures using Department of Defense statistics. The U.S.
government agreed to sell more than \$79 billion in arms to Riyadh over
that period. Related NEWS Want more of NBC News' best reporting? Sign up

--- his first trip abroad as president --- Donald Trump announced \$110
billion in immediate sales of U.S. arms and equipment, with \$350
billion in additional deals over the next 10 years. While it is unclear
how much of Trump's announcement covered deals that had already been
unveiled, the president has touted such arms sales to the Saudis in an
effort to explain the importance of the relationship with the kingdom.
American officials have also been keen to focus on what they say is the
country's key role on combating terrorism and fighting Iranian influence
throughout the region. Andrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade
said last week's calls for a ceasefire by Mattis and Pompeo were long
overdue. "[Over the last three and a half years Saudi-led forces have
inflicted a terrible humanitarian catastrophe on Yemen," he said. "We
hope that the current pressure can serve as a turning point. For far too
long, armsdealing governments have prioritized arms company profits over
the rights and lives of Yemeni people."]{.underline}

[In Yemen, nearly 13 million people, or about half its population, could
soon be on the brink of famine. More than 22 million people rely on
sparse humanitarian aid to survive.]{.underline} Cholera has infected
more than a million people in the past two years, constituting the
largest and fastest-spreading outbreak of the waterborne disease in
modern history. [The United Nations has called the situation in Yemen
the "the worst manmade humanitarian crisis in the world." This disaster
is by no means coincidental. Rather, it is the result of a massive
bombing campaign and aerial and naval blockade waged by a coalition of
10 countries led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirate]{.underline}s. From the war's first day, the United States has
provided essential support to its clients in the coalition.
American-made bombs, dropped from Saudi fighter jets that are refueled
in midair by American planes, have destroyed critical infrastructure and
killed countless civilians, from children in school buses to families at
wedding ceremonies---all targeted with the help of American intelligence
agencies. [The widely reported death toll has remained stagnant at
10,000 for the past two years. A recent report puts it closer to 80,000.

has continued unabated.]{.underline}

#### Starvation and disease are rampant in Yemen and widespread poverty and lack of infrastructure means solutions aren't coming unless the conflict ends

**[Safi]{.underline}**, Marlo. \[Writer for the National Review\].
"Yemenis Describe Their Country in Crisis". National Review, Dec 14,
**[2018]{.underline}**.
https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/12/yemenisdescribe-country-in-crisis/

[According to the United Nations, 14 million people, or half of the
population, are in desperate need of medical and nutritional aid. UNICEF
estimates that 400,000 children are severely malnourished, and 8 million
don't have access to basic water or hygiene services.]{.underline} In
2015, Fatik al-Rodaini witnessed directly the humanitarian crisis that
was unfolding in his country, so he made a career switch from journalism
and founded a humanitarian nonprofit to provide urgent assistance such
as food, medicine, blankets, and clothes. The nonprofit, Mona Relief,
has reached over 43,000 families, but Fatik tells me the number of
people in need only increases with each passing day. "Since it was
established in 2015, Mona Relief has started focusing on the suffering
of IDPs (internally displaced persons) who fled their own villages from
Saada and Hajjah governorates in northern Yemen to the capital Sanaa and
Amran governorates due to the ongoing fighting there," he tells me.
According to the U.N., there are over 2 million IDPs in Yemen, and
nearly 90 percent of them have been displaced for more than a year since
the war began. Fatik interacts with children like Amal every day --- so
gaunt from malnutrition that they are fragile to the touch, their
vertebrae visible, their skin so gossamer-thin that their bones look as
if they'd pierce it with any movement. He showed me pictures of the
children he helps, and many of them are indistinguishable from the New
York Times photo. Child who later died from malnutrition in Aslam, a
small city within Hajjah, Yemen. Courtesy of Fatik al-Roudaini. "I have
seen people eating from the garbage; I have seen people dying due to the
hunger or diseases," he says. "Imagine that people in my country didn't
receive their monthly salaries since October 2016. How could they live
without money?" Many of the country's workers stopped receiving their
salaries in 2016 due to the liquidity crisis at the Central Bank of
Yemen, making food and medicine unaffordable for most Yemenis. In 2016,
public-sector employees (30 percent of families) did not receive pay for
half of 2016 and have received their salaries only intermittently since.
[The rest of Yemenis who aren't public servants stopped receiving
regular pay because of the collapse of all industries due to the war.
The crisis has been compounded by the Saudi-led coalition's naval and
air blockade, so that civilians have been deprived of regular food and
medicine since March 2015. "The war has resulted in the world's worst
humanitarian crisis. . . . The impact of the war will continue for a
long time, and the country will not recover very soon,"]{.underline}
Fatik says. Ibrahim Mitrz, a Yemeni freelance journalist in Sanaa,
Yemen's capital and largest city, has been reporting on the conflict
since its advent. He tells me that Yemen is under siege at all hours. He
has never seen his country face such destitution and disease. "[Families
have nothing to eat; people are eating leaves. There is no urgent effort
to help these people," he tells me. Nothing is spared from the coalition
air strikes, he says. Not even weddings. In April, an air strike killed
more than 20 people at a wedding party, including the
groom]{.underline}. One of the most circulated videos after the attack
showed a young boy who had survived, clinging to his dead father's
shirt, crying "No, no, no." While the Saudi-led coalition has caused
most of the damage to Yemen by its constant bombardment and blockades,
the Houthi rebels in control of northern Yemen may also be guilty of war
crimes, according to a U.N. report released in late August. One of the
crimes they were accused of, among accusations of torturing detainees
and blocking access to humanitarian agencies, was recruiting children as
young as eight to be soldiers. [Yemenis also are facing epidemics,
specifically cholera and diphtheria. The cholera epidemic is the worst
in the world, according to the World Health Organization, with roughly
10,000 suspected cases reported each week. Cholera, if left untreated,
can kill a child within hours]{.underline}. Because nearly 2 million
children already are malnourished, they are especially vulnerable to
disease. "It is shameful to talk about the deaths caused by cholera in
the 21st century," Dr. Youssef Al-Haderi, the official spokesman of the
rebel-held Ministry of Health, tells me. "[But in Yemen, we talk about
deaths caused by cholera in the thousands." Cholera is spread by
consuming unsafe water or food that is contaminated by feces. Yemen,
already resource-poor, has a shortage of both clean water and food due
to the coalition blockades]{.underline}. According to research done by
Martha Mundy at the London School of Economics, in the first year and a
half of the coalition bombing campaign, there was strong evidence that
the Saudi-led coalition was aiming to "destroy food production and
distribution." "When the \[coalition\] attacked, they \[struck\] water
wells that feed Yemenis with clean drinking water, so Yemenis had to
seek alternatives. They used any water sources they could find,"
AlHaderi says. Diphtheria, an easily preventable infection of the nose
and throat that's highly contagious and life-threatening if left
untreated, disappeared in Yemen in 1994 but reappeared in October 2017.
Youssef notes that most of the deaths caused by diphtheria are of
children. [The toll the war has taken on the psychological health of
Yemenis is also significant. "The sound of missiles and aircraft bombs
has caused a disturbing rise in psychological health problems,
especially in women and children," Youssef tells me. The psychological
trauma inflicted by the war is so extreme that pregnant women suffer
miscarriages, and often the psychiatric medication they take to mitigate
the psychological trauma also causes miscarriage.]{.underline} Pregnant
women suffer from malnutrition like the rest of the country and often
give birth to malnourished babies. Despite the urgent need for medical
aid, most Yemenis can't afford medication or hospital treatment, and
prices of medicines have risen as the Yemeni currency has lost its
value. ["Many people cannot go to hospitals for several reasons, the
most important of which is the lack of financial ability," Youssef says.
"Imagine a country that is already poor from before the aggression and
siege, and then came the barbaric siege that destroyed everything, and
the situation is still ongoing," Youssef laments.]{.underline} "Imagine
what this does to a poor country when the richest and most powerful
