**Arms sales to Taiwan are seen as a severe encroachment to PRC
sovereignty**

**US-Taiwan Business Council** **2012** (Chinese Reactions to Taiwan
Arms Sales,
<http://www.us-taiwan.org/reports/2012_chinese_reactions_to_taiwan_arms_sales.pdf>
, 3/12)

Chinese leaders are reflexively opposed to any military collaboration
between the U.S. and Taiwan. As one prominent Chinese Foreign Ministry
official remarked in 1999, "conducting any form of military cooperation
with Taiwan would seriously interfere in China's internal affairs,
seriously violate China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
seriously contravene" understandings between the U.S. and China.10
Nevertheless, [because they are a visible and tangible manifestation of
U.S. support for Taiwan]{.underline}, offering confidence to the
populace in Taiwan and their democratically elected leadership, [Beijing
has been especially sensitive to U.S. arms sales]{.underline} --
particularly through FMS channels. [Each formal
announcement]{.underline} of a U.S. arms sale to Taiwan [tends to spur
the most vehement and largest protests from the PRC]{.underline}. There
are five underlying reasons for the negative Chinese view of U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan: First, China objects to any U.S. dealings with Taiwan
that could possibly be construed as constituting an official
relationship, because such a relationship might be seen as endorsing
Taiwan sovereignty. Therefore, [Chinese concerns over]{.underline} U.S.
[arms sales]{.underline} to Taiwan [are]{.underline} primarily [rooted
in their]{.underline} apparent [validation of Taiwan's]{.underline} de
facto [sovereignty]{.underline} -- also explaining the particular
antipathy toward FMS sales, which are conducted through government
channels. From Beijing's perspective, Taiwan is an integral part of
China, an internal Chinese issue, and the PRC reserves the right to use
force to resolve its internal political differences. It is their view
that no country should sell military equipment to what is ostensibly a
Chinese province without receiving consent from the central government
in Beijing. [From China's perspective]{.underline}, therefore, U.S.
[arms sales]{.underline} to Taiwan [constitute "a severe encroachment on
China's sovereignty]{.underline} and flagrant interference in China's
internal affairs," to use one Chinese mantra.11 Second,
[Beijing]{.underline} firmly [believes that]{.underline} U.S. [arms
sales]{.underline} to Taiwan [reduce the incentive for the Taipei
government to negotiate with China, while also increasing popular
sentiment]{.underline} on the island [in favor of]{.underline} de jure
[independence]{.underline}. For example, in early March 2000, in the
wake of a Congressional notification for Hawk-related upgrades, a senior
Chinese official asserted that "China-US relations and cross-Strait
relations are both in a crucial moment in high sensitivity" and that the
sale would "fan up the aggressive flame of Taiwan independence forces to
split the motherland and is an important cause for the tension in
Taiwan."12 In midMarch 2000, before the presidential election in Taiwan,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan also issued a public statement
asserting that U.S. arms sales have ''inflated the arrogance of the
separatist forces in Taiwan."13 Third, [Beijing perceives
the]{.underline} U.S. [sale]{.underline} of defense articles to Taiwan
[as a violation of]{.underline} understandings reached in the three
U.S.-PRC [Joint Communiqués]{.underline} -- although Beijing's
perspective reflects a fundamental disconnect with the U.S.
understanding of the same documents. In the third Joint Communiqué,
issued August 17, 1982, the PRC outlined its "fundamental policy to
strive for a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question." The U.S. side
acknowledged China's commitment to strive for a peaceful solution and
also highlighted the "new situation" that "provides favorable conditions
for the settlement of U.S.-China differences over the question of U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan." [The Joint Communiqué continues]{.underline}:
Having in mind the foregoing statements of both sides, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates Government states that it [does
not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed,
either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those
supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the United States and China, and that it intends to reduce
gradually its sales of arms to Taiwan, leading over a period of time to
a final resolution... In order to bring about, over a period of time, a
final settlement of the question of United States arms sales to Taiwan,
which is an issue rooted in history, the two governments will make every
effort to adopt measures and create conditions conducive to the thorough
settlement of this issue.14 The fundamental difference here appears to
be a disagreement over what constitutes a peaceful approach. Beijing
views its military posture in the Taiwan Strait as ensuring a peaceful
approach in part by deterring what it perceives as moves by some
factions on Taiwan toward de jure independence. It is telling that
Chinese statements generally omit references to the stated U.S.
pre-condition for a reduction in arms sales.15 In contrast, successive
U.S. administrations have defined a peaceful approach in terms of the
PRC military posture and the weapons that it has arrayed toward Taiwan.
In the wake of the 1982 Joint Communiqué, a U.S. Department of State
official testified before the U.S. Senate, outlining the idea that U.S.
sales of defense articles and services are driven by the nature of the
military challenge that the PRC poses to Taiwan. In other words, from
the U.S. perspective, the principal metric for China's "peaceful
approach" is the nature of its military posture opposite Taiwan.16 In
the 1980s, China -- increasingly concerned with the Soviet Union -- did
indeed appear to be reducing its force posture opposite Taiwan, thereby
creating conditions conducive to a reduction in arms sales.17 Seeking
even more explicit linkage, Section 531 of the Foreign Relations
Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1994 and 199518 included a
Congressional declaration that evaluations of China's peaceful approach
to resolving political differences with Taiwan should be based upon PRC
military capabilities and intentions and that Chinese force development
should be assessed on a regular basis. Fourth, [the PRC argues that arms
sales]{.underline} to Taiwan [threaten China's national
security]{.underline}. In the wake of the January 2010 Congressional
notification, for example, China's Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei issued
a demarche to the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, urging Washington to
cancel the planned sale -- which was described as "a threat to China's
national security." Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Huang Xueping
also said: "The Taiwan issue is directly linked to China's core
interests. We will never make concessions over our sovereignty and
territorial integrity." He added that the "U.S. decision seriously
endangers China's national security and harms China's core interests."19
A corollary to this perspective is the view that U.S. [policymakers
see]{.underline} Taiwan and Taiwan [arms sales as a tool for containing
China]{.underline} and for restraining Chinese development.20

#### Arms sales create a security dilemma with China with risks of miscalculation 

**Tran 2018** (Jessica Tran, "Security Dilemma in U.S.-China Relations:
A Non-traditional Security Studies Perspective", Masters of Arts in
International Studies
<https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2149&context=thes>
, May 2, 2018)

On the other hand, [U.S. military rebalancing initiative, public
displays of alliance strengthening with countries surrounding China,
overt military cooperation and drills in the Pacific, and lastly, arms
sales to Taiwan also aggravate China's perceptions of insecurity. It
leads the CCP to interpret (and express) the maneuvers as U.S. attempts
to contain their self-described peaceful rise as a global power. These
factors and resulting (mis)perceptions on both sides have been large
contributors to the security dilemma occurring in the Asia-Pacific
region between China and the U.S. and her allies.]{.underline}

**Arms sales to Taiwan fuel Chinese concerns over regional security and
control of SLOCs**

Two rejoinders help to put this counterargument into perspective. As I
have already argued, [the dangers generated by the U.S. commitment to
Taiwan go well beyond the immediate possibility of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [fighting China to protect
Taiwan]{.underline} and, therefore, are not adequately captured by
focusing solely on the cross-strait relationship. [The U.S. commitment
to Taiwan is among the key factors fueling Chinese doubts about U.S.
motives in the region and Chinese worries about]{.underline} a war over
[Taiwan make control of the Northeast Asian SLOCs far more important.
These worries contribute to military competition and strained political
relations]{.underline}, thereby [increasing the probability of
conflict]{.underline} over the longer term. Second, a grand bargain
would deal fully with this counterargument by requiring resolution of
these other disputes.

**Independently US foreign military sales to Taiwan uniquely inflame
sentiment which the US ignores**

**Feng 2012** (Zhu Feng, professor in the School of International
Studies, Beijing University, 5/2/12, New York Times,
http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/09/23/should-the-us-continue-selling-arms-to-taiwan/what-the-us-needs-to-realize-about-chinas-nationalism)

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China have been
wrestling over]{.underline} the issue of [arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline} since the 1980s. But [the friction has been
growing]{.underline} in recent years, with Beijing raising its voice and
sounding less tolerant. Despite fierce opposition from Beijing, most
American analysts regard this issue as the ringing of a hollow bell. For
example, when the Obama administration announced its first arms sale
package to Taiwan in January of 2010, China threatened to put sanctions
on American companies involved with exporting weapons to Taiwan and
quickly suspended military exchanges. When the Obama administration
informed Congress this week that it plans to sell Taiwan \$5.8 billion
worth of arms, China reacted similarly in strong terms. Despite fierce
opposition from Beijing, most American analysts regard this as a "hollow
bell ringing" -- Beijing is more likely to put its opposition in
rhetoric rather than in substance. [Some of these analysts believe that
the White House does not need to take China\'s opposition more
seriously. As a result, **they\'re likely to overlook the negative
consequences of China's opposition**]{.underline}. China understands why
the U.S. wants to keep the status quo. The arms sales have long helped
the U.S. maintain influence in the Taiwan Strait, allowing it to keep a
delicate military balance between the mainland and Taiwan. And it
reflects well on the U.S. commitment to a peaceful solution on the
Taiwan issue. However, [there is no other]{.underline} foreign relations
[issue that inflames Beijing]{.underline} \-- and ordinary Chinese \--
[more than]{.underline} the [arms sales]{.underline} issue. [The U.S.
cannot ignore the **strong Chinese nationalistic sentiments over
Taiwan**]{.underline}. China has always considered Taiwan as an
inseparable part of itself. There is no need to go through further legal
routes to vindicate China's sovereign claim over the island. But under
America\'s "one-China\" policy, the fate of Taiwan remains "undecided,\"
thereby validating these arms sales. This policy was initiated in 1979
but has not changed for 32 years. During this period, China has changed
tremendously and has become the most important business partner to the
U.S. In the coming decades, [the U.S.-China relations will only become
more important]{.underline}. [Without any new policy framework to
recalibrate these arms sales, mainland Chinese will continue to be wary
of the U.S]{.underline}. Understandably, this issue cannot be solved
quickly. Washington and Beijing must work together to find ways to
tackle the challenges.

**That leads to aggression and crisis escalation**

**Glaser 2015** (Charles Glaser, Professor of Political Science and
International Affairs, George Washington University, Spring 15,
International Security Vol. 39 No. 4,
<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/isec_a_00199.pdf> )

A third feature of China's policy that is cause for concern is that
[growing nationalism]{.underline} or weak civil-military relations, or
both, [may be contributing to greater Chinese assertiveness]{.underline}
vis-à-vis its maritime disputes and could contribute to expansion of
China's future goals.57 One interpretation suggests that China is less
dangerous than if it were not plagued by these problems, because it is
reassuring that [China's leaders do not prefer more assertive policies,
and only]{.underline} sometimes [feel compelled to pursue them to
avoid]{.underline} negative [nationalist reactions]{.underline}. An
alternative interpretation is more compelling and far less
reassuring---if [nationalist pressures]{.underline} from Chinese elites
and the broader public [are pushing China's leaders to act more
assertively or preventing them from stepping back once crises
occur]{.underline}, China could be driven to adopt more assertive
policies than those preferred by its leaders. Consequently, it is
worrisome that careful observers frequently note the role of nationalist
pressures in influencing China's policies. For example, Taylor Fravel
and Michael Swaine argue that [China's willingness to use force to
resolve territorial disputes in the East China Sea could have increased
because "acute nationalist sensitivities toward Japan exist among the
Chinese public]{.underline}." Iain Johnston explains that the Chinese
ministry of foreign affairs could not state publicly that reports that
China had declared the South China Sea a core interest were wrong,
because this "might have raised the ire of nationalists within the
population and the elite."58 [If unchecked, nationalism has the
potential to lead China to adopt]{.underline} nonsecurity
[goals]{.underline}---for example, the status that could be envisioned
accompanying the acquisition of the economic and military power needed
to be a superpower---[that could require pushing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [out of East Asia]{.underline}.59 Chinese
nationalism, however, does not appear to have begun to approach this
level of influence.60 Accommodation would be more dangerous if the
United States eventually faces this type of China, although the much
greater peril would be the full incompatibility of the two states'
regional goals.

**Sales exacerbates pre-existing tensions to the point of war**

**Symonds 2018** (Peter Symonds-WSWS International Editorial Board. "US
sells arms to Taiwan, confronts China",
<https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/09/27/chin-s27.html>, 27
September 2018)

[The US announced on Monday that it has approved another large arms sale
to Taiwan in a move that will further inflame tensions between
Washington and Beijing. The arms sale worth \$330 million comes as the
Trump administration is intensifying the US confrontation with China on
all fronts---diplomatic and military, as well as a battery of trade war
measures.]{.underline} The proposed arms deal, which is yet to be
finalised, covers parts for Taiwan's F-16, C-130, F-5, Indigenous
Defence Fighter and other military aircraft. A Pentagon statement
declared that the sale would contribute to US national security by
boosting Taiwan's military capacities. It hailed Taiwan as "an important
force for political stability, military balance and economic progress in
the region." In fact, the reverse is the case. [Taiwan, which China
regards as a renegade province, has always been one of the world's most
volatile flashpoints. The Trump administration is provocatively
strengthening diplomatic and military ties with Taiwan as part of its
broader efforts to undermine and encircle China and prepare for
war]{.underline}. The arms deal is the second since Trump took office
last year. In June 2017, the US agreed to the sale of \$1.4 billion
worth of arms, including MK-48 torpedoes, high-speed anti-radiation
missiles and early-warning radar surveillance technical support, which
will significantly enhance Taiwan's military. The US is also providing
assistance to Taiwan as it seeks to develop its own diesel-powered
submarines. In April, the US granted military contractors licences to
sell submarine technology to Taiwan, including a submarine combat
management system. A separate technical assistance agreement provides
for the sale of sonar, modern periscopes, and weapon systems. As he
assumed office last year, Trump threatened to abrogate the so-called One
China policy that has formed the basis of US diplomatic relations with
China for three decades. Under the arrangement, Washington effectively
recognises Beijing as the government of all China including Taiwan,
while opposing any attempt by China to forcibly take control of the
island. The US has also boosted ties with Taiwan through the passage of
the Taiwan Travel Act in March that authorises visits and contact
between top level Taiwanese and US diplomatic and military officials. It
also opened a new building and compound this year for the American
Institute in Taiwan, which functions as a de-facto embassy in Taipei. On
Monday, Taiwan backed away from a suggestion that it would send its
defence minister to attend the annual US-Taiwan Defence Industry
Conference in Maryland, amid concerns that upgrading its presence at the
meeting could further raise tensions with China. [China criticised the
latest arms sale, declaring that it undermined Chinese sovereignty and
security. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged the US to
"immediately withdraw the arms sales plan and stop military to military
relations between the United States and Taiwan so as to avoid further
damage to Chinese-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait."]{.underline} The Trump administration, however, has no
intention of backing off. Trump used his speech at the UN General
Assembly on Tuesday to denounce China and to hail the tariffs imposed by
his administration on \$250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Washington
has already foreshadowed a further escalation of the economic war on
China with threats to not only raise existing tariffs but extend them to
the remaining \$267 billion of Chinese exports. Yesterday Trump against
lashed out at China, accusing it of interfering in the US mid-term
elections in November. The outburst was all the more remarkable as it
was while he was chairing a session of the UN Security Council that was
meant to be addressing weapons proliferation. Referring to China, Trump
declared: "They do not want me or us to win because I am the first
president ever to challenge China on trade and we are winning on trade,
we are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere
in our upcoming election." Trump has been under siege himself from the
Democrats and sections of the US military/intelligence apparatus over
unsubstantiated allegation of collusion with Russia to influence the
outcome of the 2016 presidential election campaign. Yet he had no qualms
about using the same deceitful methods, providing no evidence for any of
the allegations in his 10-minute address. Later Trump tweeted: "China is
actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other
papers, made to look like news." China, however, is far from being the
only government that buys advertisements in the media in the US and
other countries in order to promote their wares. Like the allegations of
"Russian meddling," the evidence of "Chinese interference" is
threadbare. China's top diplomat Wang Yi told the UN Security Council:
"We did not and will not interfere in any country's domestic affairs. We
refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China."
Nevertheless, Trump's remarks are no accident, but rather signal the
start of a propaganda offensive to poison relations with China as the US
instigates trade war and prepares for military conflict. A senior Trump
official told the media that Vice President Mike Pence plans to make a
speech next week detailing allegations that China uses political,
economic, military and other means to influence US public opinion. At
the same time, the US is ramping up its military provocations against
China in the South China Sea. According to the Business Insider, the
Pentagon flew four nuclear-capable B-52 strategic bombers across the
contested waters on Monday. "The United States military will continue to
fly sail and operate wherever international law allows at a times and
places of our choosing," Pentagon spokesman Dave Eastburn declared.
While the US military claims that such operations are routine, the
presence of US warplanes and warships close to the Chinese mainland is
part of the US military build-up in the Indo-Pacific region, begun under
the Obama administration and continued under Trump. Separately Pentagon
spokesman Eastman told the media that US B-52s had also flown over the
East China Sea on Tuesday as part of a "regularly scheduled, combined
operation." Japan and China have a longstanding and tense territorial
dispute over uninhabited rocky outcrops in the East China Sea, known as
Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. [Amid rising tensions with the US,
China recently denied a request for a US warship to visit Hong Kong.
China also summoned the US ambassador to Beijing last weekend to protest
a US decision to sanction a Chinese military agency for its purchase of
Russian fighters and surface-to-air missiles. The US decision to
authorise another arms sale to Taiwan can only further fuel a dangerous
confrontation with China that has the potential to escalate from trade
war to war.]{.underline}

**Taiwan tension causes nuclear war -- US concessions are key to prevent
escalation**

**Glaser 2011** (Glaser, Professor of Political Science and
International Affairs, George Washington University, March/April 11,
Will China\'s Rise Lead to War?, Foreign Affairs,

The prospects for avoiding intense military competition and war may be
good, but growth in China\'s power may nevertheless require some changes
in U.S. foreign policy that Washington will find disagreeable \--
particularly regarding Taiwan. Although it lost control of Taiwan during
the Chinese Civil War more than six decades ago, [China still considers
Taiwan to be part of its homeland]{.underline}, and unification remains
a key political goal for Beijing. [China has made clear that it will use
force if Taiwan declares independence, and much of China\'s]{.underline}
conventional [military buildup has been dedicated to increasing its
ability to coerce Taiwan and reducing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates\' [ability to intervene]{.underline}. Because China
places such high value on Taiwan and because the United States and China
\-- whatever they might formally agree to \-- have such different
attitudes regarding the legitimacy of the status quo, [the issue poses
special dangers]{.underline} and challenges [for the U.S.-Chinese
relationship, placing it in a different category than Japan or South
Korea]{.underline}. [A crisis over Taiwan could]{.underline} fairly
[easily escalate to nuclear war, because each step along the way
might]{.underline} well [seem rational to the actors
involved]{.underline}. Current U.S. policy is designed to reduce the
probability that Taiwan will declare independence and to make clear that
the United States will not come to Taiwan\'s aid if it does.
Nevertheless, the United States would find itself under pressure to
protect Taiwan against any sort of attack, no matter how it originated.
Given the different interests and perceptions of the various parties and
the limited control Washington has over Taipei\'s behavior, a crisis
could unfold in which the United States found itself following events
rather than leading them. Such dangers have been around for decades, but
[ongoing improvements in China\'s military capabilities]{.underline} may
[make Beijing more willing to escalate a Taiwan crisis]{.underline}. In
addition to its improved conventional capabilities, China is modernizing
its nuclear forces to increase their ability to survive and retaliate
following a large-scale U.S. attack. Standard deterrence theory holds
that Washington\'s current ability to destroy most or all of China\'s
nuclear force enhances its bargaining position. [China\'s nuclear
modernization might remove that check on Chinese action, leading Beijing
to behave more boldly in future crises]{.underline} than it has in past
ones. [A U.S. attempt to preserve its ability to defend
Taiwan]{.underline}, meanwhile, [could fuel a conventional and nuclear
arms race]{.underline}. Enhancements to U.S. offensive targeting
capabilities and strategic ballistic missile defenses might be
interpreted by China as a signal of malign U.S. motives, leading to
further Chinese military efforts and a general poisoning of U.S.-Chinese
relations. Given such risks, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should consider backing away from]{.underline} its
commitment to [Taiwan. This would remove the most]{.underline} obvious
and [contentious flash point between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China and smooth the way for better
relations]{.underline} between them in the decades to come. Critics of
such a move argue that it would result in not only direct costs for the
United States and Taiwan but indirect costs as well: Beijing would not
be satisfied by such appeasement; instead, it would find its appetite
whetted and make even greater demands afterward \-- spurred by
Washington\'s lost credibility as a defender of its allies. The critics
are wrong, however, because territorial concessions are not always bound
to fail. Not all adversaries are Hitler, and when they are not,
accommodation can be an effective policy tool. [When an adversary has
limited territorial goals, granting them can lead not to further demands
but rather to satisfaction with the new status quo and a reduction of
tension]{.underline}

[As China's power has grown in recent years, so, too, has the risk of
war with the United States]{.underline}. Under President Xi Jinping,
[China has increased its political and economic pressure on Taiwan and
built military installations on coral reefs in the South China Sea,
fueling Washington's fears that Chinese expansionism will threaten U.S.
allies and influence in the region]{.underline}. [U.S. destroyers have
transited the Taiwan Strait, to loud protests from Beijing. American
policymakers have wondered aloud whether they should send an aircraft
carrier through the strait as well]{.underline}. Chinese fighter jets
have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above the South China Sea.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought long-simmering
economic disputes to a rolling boil. **[A war between the two countries
remains unlikely, but the prospect of a military
confrontation---resulting, for example, from a Chinese campaign against
Taiwan---no longer seems as implausible as it once did. And the odds of
such a confrontation going nuclear are higher than most policymakers and
analysts think.]{.underline}** Members of China's strategic com­munity
tend to dismiss such concerns. Likewise, [U.S. studies of a potential
war with China often exclude nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely,
treating them as basically irrelevant to the course of a
conflict]{.underline}. Asked about the issue in 2015, Dennis Blair, the
former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, estimated the
likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere between nil
and zero." **[This assurance is misguided]{.underline}**. If deployed
against China, [the Pentagon's preferred style of conventional warfare
would be a potential recipe for nuclear escalation]{.underline}. Since
the end of the Cold War, the United States' signature approach to war
has been simple: [punch deep into enemy territory in order to rapidly
knock out the opponent's key military assets at minimal cost. But the
Pentagon developed this formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a nuclear power. If deployed
against China, the Pentagon's preferred style of conventional warfare
would be a potential recipe for nuclear escalation. China, by contrast,
not only has nuclear weapons; it has also intermingled them with its
conventional military forces, making it difficult to attack one without
attacking the other. This means that a major U.S. military campaign
targeting China's conventional forces would likely also threaten its
nuclear arsenal. Faced with such a threat, Chinese leaders could decide
to use their nuclear weapons while they were still able to.]{.underline}
As U.S. and Chinese leaders navigate a relationship fraught with mutual
suspicion, they must come to grips with the fact that [a conventional
war could skid into a nuclear confrontation]{.underline}. Although this
risk is not high in absolute terms, [its consequences]{.underline} for
the region and the world [would be devastating]{.underline}. As long as
the United States and China continue to pursue their current grand
strategies, the risk is likely to endure. [This means that leaders on
both sides should dispense with the illusion that they can easily fight
a limited war]{.underline}. They should focus instead on managing or
resolving the political, economic, and military tensions that might lead
to a conflict in the first place. A NEW KIND OF THREAT There are some
reasons for optimism. For one, China has long stood out for its
nonaggressive nuclear doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in 1964,
China largely avoided the Cold War arms race, building a much smaller
and simpler nuclear arsenal than its resources would have allowed.
Chinese leaders have consistently characterized nuclear weapons as
useful only for deterring nuclear aggression and coercion. Historically,
this narrow purpose required only a handful of nuclear weapons that
could ensure Chinese retaliation in the event of an attack. To this day,
China maintains a "no first use" pledge, promising that it will never be
the first to use nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear conflict can
also seem like a relic of the Cold War. Back then, the United States and
its allies lived in fear of a Warsaw Pact offensive rapidly overrunning
Europe. NATO stood ready to use nuclear weapons first to stalemate such
an attack. Both Washington and Moscow also consistently worried that
their nuclear forces could be taken out in a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear
strike by the other side. This mutual fear increased the risk that one
superpower might rush to launch in the erroneous belief that it was
already under attack. Initially, the danger of unauthorized strikes also
loomed large. In the 1950s, lax safety procedures for U.S. nuclear
weapons stationed on NATO soil, as well as minimal civilian oversight of
U.S. military commanders, raised a serious risk that nuclear escalation
could have occurred without explicit orders from the U.S. president. The
good news is that these Cold War worries have little bearing on
U.S.-Chinese relations today. Neither country could rapidly overrun the
other's territory in a conventional war. Neither seems worried about a
nuclear bolt from the blue. And civilian political control of nuclear
weapons is relatively strong in both countries. What remains, in theory,
is the comforting logic of mutual deterrence: in a war between two
nuclear powers, neither side will launch a nuclear strike for fear that
its enemy will respond in kind. The bad news is that one other trigger
remains: [a conventional war that threatens China's nuclear arsenal.
Conventional forces can threaten nuclear forces in ways that generate
pressures to escalate---especially when ever more capable U.S.
conventional forces face adversaries with relatively small and fragile
nuclear arsenals, such as China. If U.S. operations endangered or
damaged China's nuclear forces, Chinese leaders might come to think that
Washington had aims beyond winning the conventional war---that it might
be seeking to disable or destroy China's nuclear arsenal outright,
perhaps as a prelude to regime change. In the fog of war, Beijing might
reluctantly conclude that limited nuclear escalation---an initial strike
small enough that it could avoid full-scale U.S. retaliation---was a
viable option to defend itself.]{.underline} STRAIT SHOOTERS [The most
worrisome flash point for a U.S.-Chinese war is Taiwan]{.underline}.
Beijing's long-term objective of reunifying the island with mainland
China is clearly in conflict with Washington's longstanding desire to
maintain the status quo in the strait. It is not difficult to imagine
how this might lead to war. For example, China could decide that the
political or military window for regaining control over the island was
closing and launch an attack, using air and naval forces to blockade
Taiwanese harbors or bombard the island. Although U.S. law does not
require Washington to intervene in such a scenario, the Taiwan Relations
Act states that the United States will "consider any effort to determine
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts
or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific
area and of grave concern to the United States." Were Washington to
intervene on Taipei's behalf, the world's sole superpower and its rising
competitor would find themselves in the first great-power war of the
twenty-first century. In the course of such a war, U[.S. conventional
military operations would likely threaten, disable, or outright
eliminate some Chinese nuclear capabilities---whether doing so was
Washington's stated objective or not. In fact, if the United States
engaged in the style of warfare it has practiced over the last 30 years,
this outcome would be all but guaranteed]{.underline}. The most
worrisome flash point for a U.S.-Chinese war is Taiwan. Consider
submarine warfare. China could use its conventionally armed attack
submarines to blockade Taiwanese harbors or bomb the island, or to
attack U.S. and allied forces in the region. If that happened, the U.S.
Navy would almost certainly undertake an antisubmarine campaign, which
would likely threaten China's "boomers," the four nuclear-armed
ballistic missile submarines that form its naval nuclear deterrent.
China's conventionally armed and nuclear-armed submarines share the same
shore-based communications system; a U.S. attack on these transmitters
would thus not only disrupt the activities of China's attack submarine
force but also cut off its boomers from contact with Beijing, leaving
Chinese leaders unsure of the fate of their naval nuclear force. In
addition, nuclear ballistic missile submarines depend on attack
submarines for protection, just as lumbering bomber aircraft rely on
nimble fighter jets. If the United States started sinking Chinese attack
submarines, it would be sinking the very force that protects China's
ballistic missile submarines, leaving the latter dramatically more
vulnerable. MICHAEL SMITH/U.S. NAVY Even more dangerous, U.S. forces
hunting Chinese attack submarines could inadvertently sink a Chinese
boomer instead. After all, at least some Chinese attack submarines might
be escorting ballistic missile submarines, especially in wartime, when
China might flush its boomers from their ports and try to send them
within range of the continental United States. Since correctly
identifying targets remains one of the trickiest challenges of undersea
warfare, a U.S. submarine crew might come within shooting range of a
Chinese submarine without being sure of its type, especially in a
crowded, noisy environment like the Taiwan Strait. Platitudes about
caution are easy in peacetime. In wartime, when Chinese attack
submarines might already have launched deadly strikes, the U.S. crew
might decide to shoot first and ask questions later. Adding to China's
sense of vulnerability, the small size of its nuclear-armed submarine
force means that just two such incidents would eliminate half of its
sea-based deterrent. Meanwhile, any Chinese boomers that escaped this
fate would likely be cut off from communication with onshore commanders,
left without an escort force, and unable to return to destroyed ports.
If that happened, China would essentially have no naval nuclear
deterrent. **[Platitudes about caution are easy in peacetime. In
wartime, U.S. forces might decide to shoot first and ask questions
later.]{.underline}** The situation is similar onshore, where any U.S.
military campaign would have to contend with China's growing land-based
conventional ballistic missile force. Much of this force is within range
of Taiwan, ready to launch ballistic missiles against the island or at
any allies coming to its aid. Once again, U.S. victory would hinge on
the ability to degrade this conventional ballistic missile force. And
once again, it would be virtually impossible to do so while leaving
China's nuclear ballistic missile force unscathed. [Chinese conventional
and nuclear ballistic missiles are often attached to the same base
headquarters, meaning that they likely share transportation and supply
networks, patrol routes, and other supporting infrastructure. It is also
possible that they share some command-and-control networks, or that the
United States would be unable to distinguish between the conventional
and nuclear networks even if they were physically separate]{.underline}.
To add to the challenge, some of China's ballistic missiles can carry
either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, and the two versions are
virtually indistinguishable to U.S. aerial surveillance. In a war,
targeting the conventional variants would likely mean destroying some
nuclear ones in the process. Furthermore, sending manned aircraft to
attack Chinese missile launch sites and bases would require at least
partial control of the airspace over China, which in turn would require
weakening Chinese air defenses. But degrading China's coastal air
defense network in order to fight a conventional war would also leave
much of its nuclear force without protection. [Once China was under
attack, its leaders might come to fear that even intercontinental
ballistic missiles located deep in the country's interior were
vulnerable]{.underline}. For years, observers have pointed to the U.S.
military's failed attempts to locate and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles
during the 1990--91 Gulf War as evidence that mobile missiles are
virtually impervious to attack. Therefore, the thinking goes, China
could retain a nuclear deterrent no matter what harm U.S. forces
inflicted on its coastal areas. Yet recent research suggests otherwise.
Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles are larger and less mobile
than the Iraqi Scuds were, and they are harder to move without
detection. The United States is also likely to have been tracking them
much more closely in peacetime. As a result, China is unlikely to view a
failed Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30 years ago as reassurance that its
residual nuclear force is safe today, especially during an ongoing,
high-intensity conventional war. China's vehement criticism of a U.S.
regional missile defense system designed to guard against a potential
North Korean attack already reflects these latent fears. Beijing's worry
is that this system could help Washington block the handful of missiles
China might launch in the aftermath of a U.S. attack on its arsenal.
That sort of campaign might seem much more plausible in Beijing's eyes
if a conventional war had already begun to seriously undermine other
parts of China's nuclear deterrent. It does not help that China's
real-time awareness of the state of its forces would probably be
limited, since blinding the adversary is a standard part of the U.S.
military playbook. [Put simply, the favored U.S. strategy to ensure a
conventional victory would likely endanger much of China's nuclear
arsenal in the process, at sea and on land. Whether the United States
actually intended to target all of China's nuclear weapons would be
incidental. All that would matter is that Chinese leaders would consider
them threatened.]{.underline} LESSONS FROM THE PAST At that point, the
question becomes, How will China react? Will it practice restraint and
uphold the "no first use" pledge once its nuclear forces appear to be
under attack? Or will it use those weapons while it still can, gambling
that limited escalation will either halt the U.S. campaign or intimidate
Washington into backing down? Chinese writings and statements remain
deliberately ambiguous on this point. It is unclear which exact set of
capabilities China considers part of its core nuclear deterrent and
which it considers less crucial. For example, if China already
recognizes that its sea-based nuclear deterrent is relatively small and
weak, then losing some of its ballistic missile submarines in a war
might not prompt any radical discontinuity in its calculus. [The danger
lies in wartime developments that could shift China's assumptions about
U.S. intentions. If Beijing interprets the erosion of its sea- and
land-based nuclear forces as a deliberate effort to destroy its nuclear
deterrent, or perhaps even as a prelude to a nuclear attack, it might
see limited nuclear escalation as a way to force an end to the conflict.
For example, China could use nuclear weapons to instantaneously destroy
the U.S. air bases that posed the biggest threat to its arsenal. It
could also launch a nuclear strike with no direct military purpose---on
an unpopulated area or at sea---as a way to signal that the United
States had crossed a redline.]{.underline} If such escalation appears
far-fetched, China's history suggests otherwise. In 1969, similar
dynamics brought China to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet
Union. In early March of that year, Chinese troops ambushed Soviet
guards amid rising tensions over a disputed border area. Less than two
weeks later, the two countries were fighting an undeclared border war
with heavy artillery and aircraft. The conflict quickly escalated beyond
what Chinese leaders had expected, and before the end of March, Moscow
was making thinly veiled nuclear threats to pressure China to back down.
[If nuclear escalation appears far-fetched, China's history suggests
otherwise.]{.underline} Chinese leaders initially dismissed these
warnings, only to radically upgrade their threat assessment once they
learned that the Soviets had privately discussed nuclear attack plans
with other countries. Moscow never intended to follow through on its
nuclear threat, archives would later reveal, but Chinese leaders
believed otherwise. On three separate occasions, they were convinced
that a Soviet nuclear attack was imminent. Once, when Moscow sent
representatives to talks in Beijing, China suspected that the plane
transporting the delegation was in fact carrying nuclear weapons.
Increasingly fearful, China test-fired a thermonuclear weapon in the Lop
Nur desert and put its rudimentary nuclear forces on alert---a dangerous
step in itself, as it increased the risk of an unauthorized or
accidental launch. Only after numerous preparations for Soviet nuclear
attacks that never came did Beijing finally agree to negotiations. China
is a different country today than it was in the time of Mao Zedong, but
the 1969 conflict offers important lessons. China started a war in which
it believed nuclear weapons would be irrelevant, even though the Soviet
arsenal was several orders of magnitude larger than China's, just as the
U.S. arsenal dwarfs China's today. Once the conventional war did not go
as planned, the Chinese reversed their assessment of the possibility of
a nuclear attack to a degree bordering on paranoia. Most worrying, China
signaled that it was actually considering using its nuclear weapons,
even though it had to expect devastating retaliation. [Ambiguous wartime
information and worst-case thinking led it to take nuclear risks it
would have considered unthinkable only months earlier. This pattern
could unfold again today.]{.underline}

political calculus proves**

While there are several scenarios where conflict between the United
States and China is possible, some analysts believe that [a conflict
over Taiwan remains the most likely place where the PRC and the U.S.
would come to blows. Beijing is aware that any coercive action on its
part to force Taiwan to accept its political domination could incur the
wrath of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [To prevent the
U.S. from intervening]{.underline} in the region[, China will certainly
turn to its anti-access/area-denial]{.underline} (A2/AD)
[strategy,]{.underline} beginning with non-lethal means and non-lethal
threats to discourage the American public from supporting the use of
force in support of Taiwan[. If thwarted]{.underline} in its initial
efforts to stop Chinese aggression against Taiwan, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [may be tempted to resort to
stronger measures and attack mainland China.]{.underline} A kinetic
response to a cyber-attack, for example, although an option, would very
likely lead to escalation on the part of the Chinese. Given the regime's
relative weakness and the probability that American attacks (cyber and
conventional) on China will include strikes against PLA command and
control (C2) nodes, which mingle conventional and nuclear C2, [the
Chinese may escalate to the use of a nuclear weapon]{.underline}
(against a U.S. carrier in China's self-declared waters for example) as
a means of forcing de-escalation. [In the view of China, such a strike
would not be a violation of its no-first-use policy because the strike
would occur in sovereign Chinese waters]{.underline}, thus making the
use of nuclear weapons a defensive act. [Since Taiwan is a domestic
matter]{.underline}, any U.S. intervention would be viewed as an act of
aggression. [This, in the minds of the Chinese, makes the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [an outside aggressor, not
China]{.underline}. It is also important to remember that [nuclear
weapons are an asymmetric response to American conventional
superiority]{.underline}. Given that China is incapable of executing and
sustaining a conventional military campaign against the continental
United States, China would clearly have an asymmetry of interest and
capability with the United States -- [far more is at stake for China
than it is for the United States. In essence, the only effective option
in retaliation for a successful U.S. conventional campaign on Chinese
soil is the nuclear one]{.underline}. Without making too crude a point,
the nuclear option provides more bang for the buck, or yuan. Given that
mutually assured destruction ([MAD) is not part of China's strategic
thinking]{.underline} -- [in fact it is explicitly rejected
--]{.underline} the PRC will see the situation very differently than the
United States. China likely has no desire to become a nuclear peer of
the United States. It does not need to be in order to achieve its
geopolitical objectives. However, [China does have specific goals that
are a part of its stated core security interests, including
reunification with Taiwan]{.underline}. Reunification is necessary for
China to reach its unstated goal of becoming a regional hegemon. As long
as Taiwan maintains its de facto independence of China it acts as a
literal and symbolic barrier to China's power projection beyond the East
China Sea. Without Taiwan, China cannot gain military hegemony in its
own neighborhood. China's maritime land reclamation strategy for
Southeast Asia pales in scope and significance with the historical and
political value of Taiwan. With Taiwan returned to its rightful place,
the relevance to China of the U.S. military presence in Japan and South
Korea is greatly diminished. China's relationship with the Philippines,
which lies just to the south of Taiwan, would also change dramatically.
Although China criticizes the United States for playing the role of
global hegemon, it is actively seeking to supplant the United States in
Asia so that it can play a similar role in the region. While Beijing may
take a longer view toward geopolitical issues than Washington does[,
Chinese political leaders must still be responsive to a domestic
audience that demands ever higher levels of prosperity. Central to
China's ability to guarantee that prosperity is the return of
Taiwan,]{.underline} and control of the sea lines of commerce and
communication upon which it relies. Unfortunately, [too many Americans
underestimate the importance of these core interests to China and the
lengths to which China will ultimately go in order to guarantee them --
even the use of nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Should China succeed it
pushing the United States back, the PRC can deal with regional
territorial disputes bilaterally and without U.S. involvement. After
all, Washington invariably takes the non-Chinese side. China sees the
U.S. as a direct competitor and obstacle to its geopolitical ambitions.
As such it is preparing for the next step in a crisis that it will
likely instigate, control, and conclude [in the Taiwan Straits. China
will likely use the election or statement of a pro-independence
high-ranking official as the impetus for action.]{.underline} [This is
the same method it used when it fired missiles in the Straits in
response to remarks by then-President Lee Teng-hui, ushering in the 1996
Taiwan Straits Crisis]{.underline}. The U.S. brought an end to the
mainland's antics when the U.S.S Nimitz and six additional ships sailed
into the Straits. Despite the pro-China presidency of Ma Ying-jeou,
China continues to expand its missile force targeting Taiwan and
undertakes annual war games that simulate an attack on Taiwan. China has
not forgotten the humiliation it faced in 1996 and will be certain no
U.S. carrier groups have access to the Strait during the next crisis.
The Second Artillery Corps' nuclear capabilities exist to help secure
the results China seeks when the U.S. is caught off-guard, overwhelmed,
and forced to either escalate a crisis or capitulate. While the scenario
described is certainly not inevitable, the fact than many American
readers will see it as implausible if not impossible is an example of
the mirror-imaging that often occurs when attempting to understand an
adversary. China is not the United States nor do Chinese leaders think
like their counterparts in the United States. [Unless we give serious
thought to possible scenarios where nuclear conflict could occur, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [may be unprepared for a
situation that escalates beyond its ability to prevent a
catastrophe.]{.underline}

**The plan reduces China's incentive to pursue other military
commitments**

This danger is smaller than critics suggest, however. If China decides
to fully pursue more ambitious missions, it would have to make large
investments that would likely dwarf the amount it is spending on
Taiwan-specific missions. Consequently, whether China eventually gains
control of Taiwan is unlikely to be decisive in determining China's
ability to invest in efforts to control the South China and East China
Sea SLOCs, and beyond. Related, it is likely that [Chinese capabilities
dedicated to Taiwan will eventually become so effective that Beijing
will be able to reallocate some of its future military investment to
other missions]{.underline}.85 Moreover, [ending the U.S. commitment to
Taiwan could reduce China's determination to pursue more challenging
distant naval missions because the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will not interrupt these SLOCs]{.underline},
except possibly during a severe crisis or major war. [Eliminating the
possibility of war over Taiwan would]{.underline} therefore [greatly
reduce Beijing's incentives to make investments in these
missions]{.underline}. China could, however, pursue greatly expanded
power projection capabilities for a variety of other reasons,86
including worst-case planning that imagines the United States will
interrupt its SLOCs under even the most unlikely conditions, a Mahanian
view of naval power that connects "commercial health with naval
primacy,"87 or the belief that superpower status requires power
projection capabilities.88 Finally, one should not exaggerate the
security risks of being unable to fully control these SLOCs. The United
States does not need to control the Strait of Malacca and the East Asian
SLOCs to enable shipping to reach Japan during a war with China.
Instead, bypass routes could allow shipping to reach oil ports on
Japan's east coast.89 Also, the ability to deny China use of these SLOCs
would be sufficient to preserve the U.S. ability to coerce China.

History has shown that emerging great powers and established or
declining great powers are likely to fight major wars in order to
determine the balance of power in the international system. [There is
considerable fear that the U.S. and China are heading towards great
power conflict.]{.underline} As Christopher Layne argues, there are
"several important --- and unsettling --- parallels between the
Anglo-Germany relationship during the run-up to 1914 and the unfolding
Sino-American relationship." The headline-grabbing dispute in the South
China Sea offers an excellent example of one of the several flashpoints
that could spark a larger conflict between the U.S. and China. [But the
probability of great power conflict between the U.S. and China can be
reduced if the two states can find ways to better manage interactions in
flashpoint areas. The oldest flashpoint, and the area most important for
Chinese domestic politics, is the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} In 1972,
the Shanghai Communique stated that the so-called Taiwan question was
the most important issue blocking the normalization of relations between
the U.S. and China. [This question has yet to be solved, mostly because
Taiwan has been]{.underline} able to deter attack through a strong
indigenous defense capability [backed up by American
commitment]{.underline}.

### AT: Arms Sales minor

#### Arms sales aren't a small incident---they can spark a major confrontation 

**Panda 2019** (Ankit Panda is an editor at The Diplomat. He writes on
security, politics, economics, and culture. "Are the US and China About
to Face off Over American Fighter Sales to Taiwan?",

, March 25, 2019)

[The United States and China appear to be heading toward **a major
confrontation** over the possible sale of American fighters to Taiwan.
Last week, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that the country's
Ministry of Defense had submitted a formal request to Washington, D.C.,
to purchase F-16V Viper fighters. Tsai said the decision to make the
request was supported by a review of Taiwan's defense needs. Days later,
Bloomberg News reported that the White House was poised to approve the
Taiwanese request.]{.underline} If that report is true, [the United
States would be turning course on what has been a longstanding
reluctance to sell fighters to Taiwan]{.underline}, even as it has
authorized other arms sales in line with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act,
which requires the U.S. government to support Taiwan "with arms of a
defensive character." Even as the Obama administration and the Trump
administration have approved weapons and spare parts for sale to Taiwan,
[fighters have long been seen as a bridge too far given Beijing serious
reservations.]{.underline} The United States authorized the sale of 150
F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992. The Obama administration, after
receiving a request from Taipei, turned it down, initiating a set of
upgrades instead to Taipei's existing fleet. [The issue hasn't gone
unnoticed in China, where Taiwan is seen as an inherent part of the
country. Relations across the Taiwan Strait have been particularly
strained since Tsai's inauguration in 2016.]{.underline} The Taiwanese
president hails from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), though she herself has not explicitly supported
independence --- long a red-line for Beijing --- Tsai, however, has
refused to endorse the so-called "1992 consensus," which her predecessor
had supported and which forms what Beijing sees as the baseline for
cordial cross-strait relations. "China's position to firmly oppose arms
sales to Taiwan is consistent and clear," Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Geng Shuang said during a press briefing on Friday. "We
have made stern representations to the U.S. We have urged the U.S. to
fully recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the harm it will
cause." [The prospect of a fighter sale to Taiwan this time comes at a
time of particularly heightened U.S.-China tensions]{.underline}. The
Trump administration has been known to seek leverage with Beijing across
issues and it is possible that this may turn into the latest case of
Taiwan being used a possible bargaining chip as Trump seeks to clinch a
favorable trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump, however,
has been unconventional on Taiwan policy in the past. As
president-elect, he broke expectations by receiving a telephone call
from Tsai. That call occurred at a time when Trump had yet to endorse
the United States' one-China policy as president --- something that he
did for the first time in February 2017. [Either way, Tsai's fighter
request and the Trump administration's reported acceptance could set up
another major area of turbulence between the United States and
China.]{.underline}

[After a decade of relative harmony, tensions between Beijing and Taipei
are rising again]{.underline}. As Taiwan\'s leaders and voters face big
choices about their future relations with China, America must think
carefully about its commitments to Taiwan. Would America be willing go
to war with China to prevent Taiwan being forcibly united with the
mainland? J. Michael Cole, responding in The National Interest to a
recent op-ed of mine in Singapore\'s Straits Times, expresses a widely
held assumption that it would, and should. [To many people it seems
self-evident that America would honor the commitments enshrined in the
Taiwan Relations Act. But the TRA was passed in 1979, when China\'s GDP
was 1/20th the size of America\'s, its place in the global economy was
miniscule, its navy and air force were negligible, and its prospects for
progress depended completely on America\'s goodwill.]{.underline}
(Recommended: 5 Chinese Weapons of War India Should Fear) So [back then
a US-China conflict carried much bigger economic and military risks for
China than for America. That made the TRA\'s commitments both highly
credible and very unlikely to be tested. Washington could]{.underline}
safely [assume that Beijing would back off]{.underline} to avoid a
conflict in which China had so much more to lose than America. [**Things
are different today.** China\'s economy is now so big and so central to
global trade and capital flows]{.underline} that the consequences of any
disruption would be just as serious for America as for China.
Militarily, [America can no longer expect a swift and certain victory in
a war]{.underline} over Taiwan. [China\'s anti-access/area-denial
capabilities would preclude direct US intervention]{.underline} unless
those capabilities had first been degraded by a sustained and
wide-ranging strike campaign against Chinese bases and forces.
(Recommended: 4 Chinese Weapons of War Taiwan Should Fear) [China would
very likely respond to such a campaign with attacks on US and allied
bases throughout Asia. The US has no evident means to cap the resulting
escalation spiral]{.underline}, and no one could be sure it would stop
below the nuclear threshold. [The possibility of nuclear attacks on US
cities would have to be considered.]{.underline} These [new realities of
power mean that today a US-China conflict would impose equal risks and
costs on both sides. And where costs and risks are equal, the advantage
lies with those who have more at stake, and hence greater resolve.
China\'s leaders today seem to think they hold this advantage, and they
are probably right. **It is**]{.underline} therefore **[a big mistake to
keep assuming,]{.underline}** as many people seem to do[, **that China
would be sure to back off before a crisis over Taiwan became a
conflict.**]{.underline} (Recommended: 5 Chinese Weapons of War America

Any [reassurance the world may have derived from Beijing\'s repeated
emphasis on China\'s \"peaceful rise\" has long since been **swept
away** by increasingly **threatening rhetoric**]{.underline}, most
[notably towards **Japan** over the disputed **Senkaku-Diaoyu
islands.**]{.underline} [Indeed, the Pacific region looks set to become
the **testing ground** for an old theory that has enjoyed a striking
comeback thanks to globalisation: the notion that **economic
interdependence is conducive to peace.**]{.underline} Historically, the
idea is associated with Montesquieu, the French Enlightenment thinker
who believed moralistic philosophy and religious precept had failed to
restrain man\'s destructive passions, but that these passions could be
harnessed by the pursuit of material self-interest. In De l\'esprit des
lois, he declared that \"the natural effect of commerce is to lead to
peace\". In the 19th century, the economic liberal Richard Cobden
extended the argument, saying that the principle of free trade would not
only remove the desire to build empires, armies and navies but lead to
benign global government. [Such thinking was dealt a devastating blow by
the outbreak of the **first world war**.]{.underline} The blow was not
quite fatal. After 1945, the proposal by Robert Schuman for a
Franco-German coal and steel community, which later morphed into the EU,
specifically aimed to bind France and Germany so close as, in the
statesman\'s words, to make war \"not only unthinkable but materially
impossible\". Perhaps the most powerful recent statement of this liberal
internationalism comes from the Yale economist, Robert Shiller, who
argues in his book, Finance and the Good Society, that financial
interconnectedness may help prevent war because it provides \"a
civilised stage for the playing out of aggressive impulses . . . Thus
financial development may lead to a kinder and gentler - if not
altogether kind and gentle - society.\" If this argument has proved
resilient, it might be because there is something in it. Developed
countries no longer engage in wars of plunder against each other,
although the developing world is another matter. It seems inconceivable,
too, that German tanks will once again sweep into France, the
Netherlands or Belgium. Yet whether that is down to economic
interdependence or to the complex EU political ecosystem is moot.
Moreover, the cold war provided France and Germany with a common enemy
and a nuclear context that were conducive to a psychological shift away
from militarism and nationalism. **[China]{.underline}** [presents an
**overwhelming difficulty**]{.underline}. [It is **highly
interdependent**]{.underline}. Between 2009 and 2011, trade accounted
for 53 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with just 28 per
cent for the US. Its pursuit of a mercantilist exchange rate policy has
boosted official reserves to more than \$3tn, which are substantially
invested in the IOUs of its strategic rival. It is a big recipient of
direct investment from the US, Japan and Europe. In a phrase used by
Prof Shiller, [its \"conflictual tendencies have space to
roam\"]{.underline}. [Yet it is **far from clear** that this has led to
a kinder, gentler society in China]{.underline}. To the modest extent
that the country has become more liberal since 1978,
[interconnectedness]{.underline} has played a part. But this has
[stemmed more from the **internet**]{.underline}, which has proved hard
for Beijing to control, [than from trade. More important,
interdependence has **done little** to **damp the nationalist
instincts**]{.underline} [that have driven China\'s new
**assertiveness** and prompted **nationalistic responses in
Japan**]{.underline} and **[elsewhere]{.underline}**. [And that is the
most powerful counter-argument to Montesquieu et al. Modern wars are
**more often a product of tribalism and nationalism**]{.underline}
[reinforced by deep **insecurities** and **arms races**]{.underline}.
[There is also the risk that the ruling elite will, quite
**rationally**, put **its own interests** **before those of the
nation**]{.underline}. [Since its legitimacy derives primarily from high

will matter far more than economic links.]{.underline} John Maynard
Keynes, against Montesquieu and Cobden, argued in 1933 that [free trade
combined with capital mobility was likely to \"set up strains and
enmities\" that were more likely to provoke war than inhibit warmongers.

### AT: China Defense 

#### Their defense is right about China war broadly---which takes out their prolif and deterrence impacts---but Taiwan is the one exception where war is possible

JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii---[U.S. military forces in the
Pacific are alarmed by what they see as an increasingly capable China
using military intimidation and economic coercion to bully its smaller
neighbors. So far, these tactics fall short of actual armed conflict.
But U.S. defense officials]{.underline} here and in Washington, most of
whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic,
[say]{.underline} if the United States does not stay on alert in the
region, [Beijing could use force to advance its interests---**and Taiwan
in particular is a major potential flash point**.]{.underline} Among the
signs of Beijing's increasing aggression, a Chinese warship came within
45 yards of the bow of a Navy destroyer in the South China Sea late last
year, a close encounter the service characterized as "unsafe and
unprofessional." Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has increased the frequency of
movement through the strategically important Taiwan Strait, including
most recently on March 24, after China repeatedly sent military aircraft
and ships to circle the island for drills. And in January, China's
President Xi Jinping warned that any efforts by the contested island
democracy to assert its full independence could be met by armed force,
and he implicitly threatened the United States if it tries to intervene.
In what appears to be a signal to China, [the Trump administration has
reportedly given tacit approval to Taiwan's request for 60 new F-16
fighter jets, prompting fresh protests from Beijing.]{.underline}
[Previous administrations, including former Presidents George W. Bush
and Barack Obama, rejected Taiwan's request to buy new F-16s, likely so
as not to provoke China.]{.underline} But this time, while the formal
process has not yet been completed, officials and experts said [it will
likely go through given President Donald Trump's administration's more
hawkish attitude toward China]{.underline}. John Bolton, Trump's
national security advisor, is a proponent of the deal, said one former
defense official. "There is a consensus that's almost bipartisan in
Washington that it's time to be a bit more assertive against China,"
said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group. "This is the
part where fighters are geopolitics with wings." The U.S. military's
increasing concern over China's actions in the Pacific come amid tense
negotiations between the Trump administration and Beijing to end a
tariff and trade rules standoff that has roiled global markets. National
and financial security are inexorably tangled in the region, as China
uses not just military but also economic tactics to coerce its
vulnerable neighbors. "China represents our greatest long-term strategic
threat to a free and open Indo-Pacific, and to the United States," Adm.
Phil Davidson, the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, recently
warned the Senate. Between the Spratly and Paracel islands in the South
China Sea, China has built roughly eight islands, populated with
advanced surface-to-air missiles and airfields that can support bombers
and other aircraft, said one U.S. Air Force official here. At the same
time, Beijing has employed dubious maritime tactics in the South China
Sea, such as using disguised military vessels, painted white to look
like China Coast Guard ships, to intimidate Vietnamese fishing boats.
China also has between 100,000 and 150,000 fishing vessels that "at any
point they could operationalize" and use "to blockade, intimidate, or
coerce other nations," the official said. **[While an all-out war
between the United States and China is unlikely, Taiwan is the one place
where the two countries' conflicting interests could lead to a military
confrontation, said one senior U.S. defense official.]{.underline}**
Beijing has opposed any attempt by the island nation to declare
independence since 1949, when the two split after Mao Zedong's
Communists won China's civil war.

[China has reacted with anger to the news that the United States is
ready to approve a \$330 million arms sale to neigboring
Taiwan.]{.underline} The contract was confirmed in a Pentagon news
release on Monday that detailed an inventory of spare parts and repairs
to be bought from the U.S. for Taiwanese military aircraft. [At a daily
press conference on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign
Ministry, Geng Shuang, expressed anger over the deal and said China had
already made its feelings clear to U.S. representatives.]{.underline}
The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in its statement
that the proposed sale would "contribute to the foreign policy and
national security of the United States by helping to improve the
security and defensive capability of the recipient." The statement added
that Taiwan continues to be "an important force for political stability,
military balance, and economic progress in the region." [Senior
politicians in Beijing view Taiwan as a breakaway province that will
eventually be reclaimed as part of the mainland. China has used its
growing economic power to ask nations it trades with to accept this "one
China" view.]{.underline} However, many Taiwanese want their island to
be considered a separate nation and other global powers, including the
United States, have wrestled with diplomatic language to try and satisfy
both sides. Under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, military
deals with Taiwan had become less frequent as Washington attempted to
improve its relationship with Beijing. [If approved by Congress, this
latest sale would mark the second arms deal between Taiwan and the U.S.
during the tenure of President Donald Trump. The first, and much bigger
deal, was carried out in June 2017 when the U.S. agreed to sell
missiles, torpedoes and an early warning system to Taiwan for \$1.4
billion. At that time, a Chinese ambassador said the deal damaged trust
between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping]{.underline}.

### Ext Yes War---AT: Deterrence

#### The risk of war in Asia---particularly Taiwan---is high---deterrence based approaches of re-engagement fail and cause war

shifts in power",

Or what if the Taiwanese navy vessel that accidentally fired an
anti-shipping missile in the direction of the mainland in July 2016 had
struck a Chinese rather than a Taiwanese craft? And rather than this
incident occurring on the 95th anniversary of the Chinese Communist
Party, what if it were to occur in the nationalistic ­atmosphere of the
party's centenary in 2021? [**The risk of major war in Asia is much
greater today than most people assume**.]{.underline} [All it would take
is an accidental clash between the wrong two militaries, at the wrong
place or the wrong time, and a highly dangerous escalation could occur.
Asia has been lucky so far that it hasn't.]{.underline} Serendipity has
played a critical role throughout history when leaders have walked back
from the brink of war. In the documentary The Fog of War, Robert
McNamara, who served as US defence secretary during the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, reflects on the part providence played in
avoiding nuclear Armageddon during the Cuban missile crisis, "At the end
we lucked out," he says. "It was luck that prevented war. We came that
close to nuclear war at the end. Rational individuals: Kennedy was
rational; Khrushchev was rational; Castro was rational. Rational
individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies. And
that danger exists today." [We should learn from McNa­mara's wisdom. It
would be ­imprudent to assume that Asia's luck will hold indefinitely. It
is not only the danger of localised conflict in Asia that confronts us.
The danger of "wide war" in Asia is growing, too, because this region is
experiencing what eminent Australian strategist Coral Bell once
described as a "crisis slide". As Bell wrote in the early 1970s: "There
are periods in history when individual crises remain distinct, like
isolated boulders rolling down a mountainside. Each may do some damage,
and present some dangers, but they are events discrete in themselves ...
there are other periods when the boulders, or the crises, not only come
thick and fast, but seem, as it were, to repercuss off each other until
the whole mountainside, or the whole society of states, begins to
crumble." Bell pointed to two previous ­instances when such "crises
slides" ended in catastrophic conflict. The first was in the lead-up to
World War I, which was preceded by a ­series of international crises ---
the First Moroccan Crisis (1905-06), the First Balkan Crisis (1908-09),
the Second Moroccan Crisis (1911) and the culminating crisis of July
1914, which was sparked by the ­assassination of Austrian archduke Franz
Ferdinand. The second was the lead-up to World War II, where a similar
­series of events --- Hitler's remilitarisation of the Rhineland (1936),
his annexation of Austria and his occupation of the Sudetenland under
the terms of the Munich Agreement (1938), the signing of the Pact of
Steel between Germany and Italy, and Hitler's ­invasion of Czechoslovakia
and Poland (1939) --- left Britain and France with no option other than
to declare war against Germany in September 1939. Crisis slides of the
kind that preceded the world wars are dangerous for three reasons. They
make international relations more volatile. Governments become more
antagonistic towards, and distrustful of, one another. These animosities
intensify and begin to roll over into other areas. Governments also
increasingly harden their positions and become less ­inclined to
co-operate or compromise with each passing crisis. Every crisis
inevitably generates "winners and losers", and the lessons most losing
governments take is that firmer diplomatic and strategic postures are
needed to avoid losing face in future.]{.underline} Repeated crises also
have the seemingly paradoxical effect of generating an unhealthy level
of complacency. [As more crises are ­resolved seemingly short of war ---
even if their underlying causes are not --- governments begin to
**disbelieve the possibility that they could end up waging full-blown
conflict.** A crisis slide is evident in Asia today.]{.underline} After
a period of relative calm that stretched from the mid-1990s through the
2000s, crises around the region have been coming thick and fast. The
sinking of the ROKS Cheonan and North Korea's bombing of Yeonpyeong
Island took the Korean peninsula to the brink of war in 2010. Tokyo's
nationalisation of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and Beijing's provocative
reactions had respected commentators talking up the prospects of
Sino-Japanese conflict from 2012 to 2014. Similar claims were made about
the South China Sea following the Scarborough Shoal and Beijing oil-rig
crises of 2012 and 2014. This speculation has intensified following
Beijing's land-reclamation cam­paign, which has seen the ­development of
military facilities on many of this area's disputed land features.
Today, after two decades of calm, tensions over Taiwan are resurfacing
following the election of an independence-leaning president. The clouds
of danger also hang over the Korean peninsula, despite Trump tweeting
that this crisis has passed due to his summit with Kim. The connections
between these areas also have been intensifying. Japan's increasing
involvement in the South China Sea reflect its concern that what China
gets away with here will set the terms for what the international
community will accept in the East China Sea. Trump's harder line on
Taiwan has been seen as a reflection of his frustration at Beijing's
unwillingness to deal more decisively with Pyongyang or to de-­escalate
in the South China Sea. The positions of the key players are hardening.
Washington continues to insist on Pyongyang's denuclearisation as a
non-negotiable element of its diplomacy. China's leaders remain
concerned about appearing weak to a virulently anti-Japanese populace,
while the same is true in reverse. The US is concerned that seeming so
in response to growing Chinese assertiveness will further erode ­regional
confidence in US resolve, particularly in the eyes of US allies and
partners. At the same time, there seems a strange complacency about the
prospects for conflict in Asia --- even as the key players understand
how devastating major war would be. The leaders of China and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations have spent almost two decades
discussing the development of a South China Sea code of conduct,
intended to avoid the use of military force to resolve disputes in this
area. Despite their ­recent agreement to restart negotiations, they seem
no closer to ­realising that goal than they were in the late 1990s.
Washington has spent much of the past quarter-century kicking the North
Korean can down the road, leading to the dangerous drift towards war
last year. Similarly, Chinese and Japanese officials have spent a decade
haggling over a hotline to avoid accidental air and naval clashes. In
May they finally committed to begin operating this mechanism, although
it remains unclear whether it will cover the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands. Given the glacial pace at which each of these initiatives has
progressed, one can be excused for thinking that Asia's leaders are
daydreaming about the prospects for peace rather than sleepwalking
towards war. Such complacency is dangerous and badly misplaced. Some
commentators suggest the most viable way to avoid catastrophic conflict
in Asia is for the US and China to strike a "grand bargain", where one
side gives up something strategically significant in exchange for
something of equal or greater value. Trump, given his background in
business, may be well disposed towards such a deal. This speculation has
generated concern in Taiwan and Asia-Pacific countries that Trump may be
willing to trade away US support in Asia in exchange for China's help
with ­resolving the North Korean ­nuclear issue. Even if Trump and Chinese
President Xi Jinping did trade North Korea for Taiwan, there is no
guarantee that this would ­arrest Asia's crisis slide. It is difficult to
envisage Kim giving up without a fight. Instead, he would likely look
for succour from other patrons, such as Russia, and through illicit
channels. He could seek to transfer nuclear weapons materials and
technology to non-state actors. In a worst-case scenario, he even might
unleash his nuclear arsenal on the world. Troublingly, declining powers
throughout history have shown a tendency to lash out. The risk of
escalation remains on the Korean peninsula, too, ­despite the heat that
recent summits at Panmunjom and in Singapore have taken out of this
nuclear conundrum. Should these ongoing diplomatic efforts falter, there
could certainly come a point when Kim reads too much into ­aggressive
American rhetoric and mistakenly believes US military preparations are a
prelude to ­attack, prompting him to order an anticipatory strike.
Alternatively, Trump could take his "America first" logic to its extreme
and risk sacrificing Seoul and cities in Japan to eliminate the threat
North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles pose to the US
homeland. Or Kim, feeling ­invul­nerable because of his burgeoning nuclear
and missile arsenal, and buoyed by the prospect of a faltering US-South
Korea alliance, could launch a surprise conventional strike against
Seoul with a view to reunifying Korea by force. Asia is home to
antipathies and animosities that run deep. The legitimacy of its leaders
--- even and arguably especially those of non-democratic countries ---
depends heavily on their attentiveness to these sentiments. Showing
weakness towards a long-time adversary can amount to political suicide.
This is not to suggest that finding a lasting solution to the crisis in
Asia is impossible. As peace ­processes past have shown --- in far-flung
locales such as Aceh, Cambodia, Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka ---
solutions can spring suddenly from the most seemingly ­intractable of
disputes. Many hope the Korean peninsula will prove a case in point. But
hope is never a strategy. Management through deterrence offers the
likeliest means for keeping the peace on the Korean peninsula and in the
East China Sea. The recent introduction of measures designed to reduce
the risk of miscommunications and accidental clashes also will help. But
these measures do not go far enough. We urgently need much more
ambitious approaches, agreed to in advance, for managing major crises.
Debate over Asia's future is deeply divided. On one side are those who
contend that China soon will emerge as the region's dominant power, as
its inexorable economic and military rise marginalises US influence and
eventually evicts America from this part of the world. Some would argue
we have already reached that point. Australia's first ambassador to
China, Stephen Fitzgerald, boldly declared in an address in March last
year that "we are living in a Chinese world". On the other side are
those who argue that the US-led Asian order, which has been in place
since the end of World War II, can still be preserved if the US and
other "like-minded" countries, such as Australia, India and Japan, are
prepared to stand together to stare down the Chinese challenge. Asia's
most viable future lies somewhere between these opposing camps. [When
the US and its allies think about the Asian balance of power, balance in
any genuine sense is hardly what they have in mind. The "balance" they
are used to is where their side enjoys a significant margin of strength
over its adversaries. This keeps the peace and preserves the
international order because those opponents are in no position to mount
a serious military challenge. This kind of lopsided balance cannot last.
Indeed, it is already toppling. As China's economic and military
strength grows, **America's ability to intervene in the Taiwan Strait is
receding, while an attempt to re-engage carries the risk of sparking "a
war like no other"**.]{.underline} Similarly, Washington will find it
increasingly harder to stare down Beijing in the South China Sea;
­geography favours China too strongly.

## Israel Iran

### 1AC Israel Iran 

#### Arms sales to Taiwan cause Chinese retaliation over Iran -- the impact is Israel strikes

Indeed[, China has used its arms trade with Iran to entangle its U.S.
relations over Taiwan]{.underline}. [For example]{.underline}, on 2
September 1992, President [Bush announced the sale of]{.underline} 150
F-15 [fighters to Taiwan, and China immediately threatened to
sell]{.underline} M-11 [missiles to Pakistan and]{.underline} components
to [Iran.]{.underline} [China contends that F-16 and missiles were both
arms proliferation, and the U.S. has no right to play a double
standard]{.underline}. The U.S. protested that M-11 missile components
violate China's commitments to MTCR guidelines and parameters, while
China riposted by stating that F-16 sales to Taiwan violate the 1982
Joint Communiqué dealing with U.S. arms sales to Taiwan (The Washington
Times, October 4, 1994). Over subsequent years, [Chinese officials
repeatedly evoked the Taiwan-Iran linkage to justify its continued arms
proliferation to Iran]{.underline} \[8\]. According to Professor Shi
Yinhong, the [director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin
University]{.underline} in Beijing, \"[China will do its utmost to find
a balance]{.underline} ... dilute it \[sanctions\], to make it limited,
rather than veto it\" (New York Time, September 30). Given its Persian
Gulf strategy standing as the Great Wall of China blocking the road
toward future sanctions on Iran, [this will present serious challenges
for Israel and for the global nonproliferation regime]{.underline}.
Challenges for Israel and global nonproliferation regime For Israel,
given the grim prospect of sanctions, inability of the Six Powers to
arrest Iran's nuclear weapons development, impending delivery of the
S-300 anti-aircraft system, and increasing Israeli perception that the
United States would not support Israel, the military option remains on
the table. In March 2009, [the Center for Strategic and International
Studies released a study on possible Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear
facilities without U.S. support]{.underline} \[9\]. The first scenario
consists of three possible routes of Israeli air-force strike, with the
highest political risk but the lowest operational risk via a southern
route over Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iraqi airspace. [The second scenario
consists of a ballistic missile attack]{.underline}, the Jericho III,
capable of carrying a 750 kg nuclear warhead and a range that covers the
entire Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and almost all parts of North
America \[10\]. Yet, given the increasing complications of an air
strike, some Israeli defense analysts posit that a more realistic
military option is a nuclear missile strike \[11\]. [If Israel is forced
to act alone, and the international community is unable to stop Iran's
nuclear weapons aspirations, a nuclear strike in the Middle East would
be a disaster]{.underline}. Israel almost used nuclear weapons (The
Samson Option) during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when 13 twenty-kiloton
atomic weapons were assembled and the Middle East teetered on the edge
of a nuclear strike \[12\]. With the current Iranian nuclear program,
[the Middle East once again finds itself teetering on the edge of a
nuclear strike]{.underline} as the sand clock nears empty [before Iran
acquires breakout capability or Israel launches its nuclear
missiles.]{.underline} Thus, [unless China]{.underline}, along with
Russia, [unite with the remaining six powers to]{.underline} accelerate
effective sanctions to [arrest Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program,
this may lead to a cascade of destabilizing nuclear proliferation in the
Middle East and East Asia]{.underline}. If China wants to maintain a new
energy silk road with Iran in the long term, it would need to act soon
and remove itself as an obstacle to immediate and effective sanctions on
Iran's nuclear program.

**The likelihood of retaliation is growing -- importance of US/China
relations increases China's leverage**

**US-Taiwan Business Council 2012** (Chinese Reactions to Taiwan Arms
Sales,
<http://www.us-taiwan.org/reports/2012_chinese_reactions_to_taiwan_arms_sales.pdf>
, 3/12)

From China's perspective, however, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan infringe
upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, contradict perceived
understandings reached in the three U.S.-PRC Joint Communiqués, and
undermine China's efforts to resolve political differences on its own
terms.5 Since abrogation of the U.S.- Republic of China (ROC) Mutual
Defense Treaty in 1980, Beijing's responses to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan
have ranged from diplomatic protests to implicit threats of imposing
monetary damages on U.S. interests and on U.S. companies. China's
overall goal is to impose political isolation on Taiwan and to enforce
that isolation in order to coerce the island's democratically elected
leadership into a political settlement on terms favorable to Beijing. It
can be assumed that an interim objective would be an amendment to, if
not outright repeal of, the Taiwan Relations Act, in order to weaken
U.S. support for Taiwan. [Since 2008, China's reaction to any
announcements of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan seems to reflect an increased
confidence in their ability to influence U.S.
decision-making]{.underline} in its favor. [China]{.underline}
apparently [perceives itself as having increased leverage due to the
Obama administration's focus on]{.underline} military operations in
[Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}, as well as its overriding [interests
in international financial issues and]{.underline} its grave [concerns
over nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran]{.underline}. [Because the
U.S. seeks China's cooperation on]{.underline} some of [these issues,
they also offer the PRC unparalleled opportunities to affect American
policymakers]{.underline}.

#### Israel is uniquely worried about Chinese arms sales to Iran 

**Middle East Monitor 2019** (Middle East Monitor Citing a study
published by the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel
Aviv University, "Israeli concerns about Chinese weapons in Middle
East",
<https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190111-israeli-concerns-about-chinese-weapons-in-middle-east/>
, January 11, 2019)

[Israeli fears]{.underline} [The study considered that the expansion of
China's security export to the Middle East would gradually pose an
increasing challenge for Israel and the Israeli army for the following
reasons: First, China supplies weapons to Iran, which is an enemy state
for Israel. Iran transfers that weapon or the weapon it develops by
Chinese experience to Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad, which constitute resistance movements against Israel.
Second]{.underline}, most of the Chinese weapons that reach the region
are used by the Chinese army mainly, and not widely deployed in the
world. Therefore, ["there is a challenge in identifying and responding
to their technical, technological and performance capabilities." Third,
unlike the US arms sales to countries in the region, China does not have
the necessary legislation to maintain Israel's qualitative military
edge. China and Israel have no regular channel of dialogue on this
issue.]{.underline}

#### China views Iran and Taiwan on opposite sides in their arms diplomacy used to achieve foreign policy objectives 

**Béraud-Sudreau 2018** (Lucie Béraud-Sudreau is Research Fellow for
defense Economics and Procurement and Meia Nouwens is Research Fellow
for Chinese defense Policy and Military Modernisation at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies. "ANALYSIS: Chinese Arms
Sales Are Not a Diplomatic Weapon",
<https://international.thenewslens.com/article/99619> , 7/13/2018)

[Further evidence of China's transactional arms exports is the arms
diplomacy that China and Taiwan have tried to apply to woo allies on the
world stage. While economic incentives have been widely used to
influence changes in diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People's
Republic of China, China has not, in the past five years, transferred
any major conventional weapons systems to countries that recognize or
used to recognize Taiwan.]{.underline} Both of these examples reflect
the fact that arms sales are not a straightforward foreign policy tool
to maneuver. Arms sales take place if and only if recipient states have
the need for new weapons systems and have a preference for Chinese
products. [China still traditionally sells to states where Western
exporters will not sell due to sanctions (like Iran), states that cannot
afford to purchase Western weapons systems (like Zambia) and states that
fall into both categories (like Sudan and Venezuela).]{.underline}

#### Israeli strikes cause extinction---even minor confrontation spirals 

**Avery 2013** Associate Professor, University of Copenhagen (11/6/2013,
John Scales Avery, "An Attack On Iran Could Escalate Into Global Nuclear
War," <http://www.countercurrents.org/avery061113.htm>)

Despite the willingness of Iran\'s new President, Hassan Rouhani to make
all reasonable concessions to US demands, [Israeli]{.underline} pressure
groups in Washington continue to demand [an attack on Iran]{.underline}.
But such an attack [might escalate into a global nuclear
war]{.underline}, with catastrophic consequences. As we approach the
100th anniversary [World War I]{.underline}, we should remember that
this colossal disaster [escalated uncontrollably from what was intended
to be a minor conflict. There is a danger that an attack on Iran would
**escalate into a large-scale war in the Middle East**, **entirely
destabilizing a region**]{.underline} that is already deep in problems.
[The unstable government of Pakistan might be overthrown, and the
revolutionary Pakistani government might enter the war on the side of
Iran, thus **introducing nuclear weapons into the
conflict**.]{.underline} [Russia and China, firm allies of Iran, might
also be drawn in]{.underline}to a general war in the Middle East. [Since
much of the world\'s oil comes from the region, such a war would
certainly cause the price of oil to reach unheard-of heights, with
**catastrophic effects on the global economy**.]{.underline} In the
dangerous situation that could potentially result from an attack on
Iran, [there is a risk that nuclear weapons would be used, either
intentionally, or by accident or miscalculation]{.underline}. [Recent
research has shown that besides making large areas of the world
uninhabitable through long-lasting radioactive contamination, **a
nuclear war would damage global agriculture** to such a extent that a
global famine of previously unknown proportions would
result.]{.underline} Thus, [nuclear war is the ultimate ecological
catastrophe. **It could destroy human civilization and much of the
biosphere.** To risk such a war would be an unforgivable offense against
the lives and future of all the peoples of the world]{.underline}, US
citizens included.

#### Strikes cause a litany of impacts

Newspaper Co,

)

[A unilateral Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities would likely
have dire consequences]{.underline}, [including a regional war, global
economic collapse and a major power clash.]{.underline}¶ [For an Israeli
campaign to succeed, it must be quick and decisive]{.underline}. This
requires an attack that would be so overwhelming that Iran would not
dare to respond in full force.¶ [Such an outcome is extremely unlikely
since the locations of some of Iran's nuclear facilities are not fully
known and known facilities are buried deep underground.]{.underline}¶
[All of these widely spread facilities are shielded by elaborate air
defense systems]{.underline} constructed not only by the Iranians, but
also the Chinese and, likely, the Russians as well. By now, [Iran has
also built redundant command and control systems and nuclear facilities,
developed early-warning systems, acquired ballistic and cruise missiles
and upgraded and enlarged its armed forces.]{.underline}¶ [Because Iran
is well-prepared, a single, conventional Israeli strike]{.underline} ---
or even numerous strikes --- [could not destroy all of its capabilities,
giving Iran time to respond.]{.underline}¶ A regional war¶ Unlike Iraq,
whose nuclear program Israel destroyed in 1981, [Iran has a
second-strike capability comprised of a coalition of Iranian, Syrian,
Lebanese, Hezbollah, Hamas, and]{.underline}, [perhaps, Turkish
forces]{.underline}. I[nternal pressure might compel Jordan, Egypt, and
the Palestinian Authority to join the assault, turning a bad situation
into a regional war]{.underline}.¶ During the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, at
the apex of its power, Israel was saved from defeat by President Nixon's
shipment of weapons and planes. Today, [Israel's numerical inferiority

opponents.]{.underline}¶ Despite Israel's touted defense systems,
[Iranian coalition missiles, armed forces, and terrorist attacks would
likely wreak havoc on its enemy, leading to a prolonged
tit-for-tat]{.underline}.¶ In the absence of massive U.S. assistance,
[Israel's military resources may quickly dwindle, forcing it to use its
alleged nuclear weapons]{.underline}, as it had reportedly almost done
in 1973.¶ [An Israeli nuclear attack would likely destroy most of Iran's
capabilities, but a crippled Iran and its coalition could **still attack
neighboring oil facilities, unleash** global **terrorism,** **plant
mines in the Persian Gulf and impair maritime trade i**n the
Mediterranean, Red Sea and Indian Ocean.]{.underline}¶ [**Middle Eastern
oil shipments would** likely **slow to a trickle** as production
declines due to the war and insurance companies decide to drop their
risky Middle Eastern clients. Iran and Venezuela would likely stop
selling oil to the Un]{.underline}ited [S]{.underline}tates and Europe.¶
**[The world economy would head into a tailspin]{.underline}**;
international acrimony would rise; and [Iraqi and Afghani citizens might
fully turn on the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, immediately
[requiring the deployment of more American troops]{.underline}. [Russia,
China, Venezuela, and maybe Brazil and Turkey]{.underline} --- all of
which essentially support Iran --- [could be tempted to form an alliance
and openly challenge the U.S. hegemony.]{.underline}¶ Replaying Nixon's
nightmare¶ [Russia and China might rearm their injured Iranian protege
overnight,]{.underline} just as Nixon rearmed Israel, [and threaten to
intervene,]{.underline} just as the U.S.S.R. threatened to join Egypt
and Syria in 1973. President [Obama's response would likely **put U.S.
forces on nuclear alert**,]{.underline} replaying Nixon's nightmarish
scenario.¶ Iran may well feel duty-bound to respond to a unilateral
attack by its Israeli archenemy, but it knows that it could not take on
the United States head-to-head. In contrast, if the United States leads
the attack, Iran's response would likely be muted.¶ If Iran chooses to
absorb an American-led strike, its allies would likely protest and send
weapons, but would probably not risk using force.¶ While no one has a
crystal ball, leaders should be risk-averse when choosing war as a
foreign policy tool. If attacking Iran is deemed necessary, Israel must
wait for an American green light. **[A unilateral Israeli strike could
ultimately spark World War III.]{.underline}**

#### China-Iran military relations are increasing -- that lowers the threshold for missile exchange 

**Tiezzi 2014** (Shannon Tiezzi, Managing editor at the Diplomat,

[This week, the commander of Iran's navy made his first ever visit to
China,]{.underline} Chinese media reported. Rear Admiral Habibollah
Sayyari met with Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan as well as
Admiral Wu Shengli, commander of the PLA Navy. [Sayyari's trip to China
is the latest sign of increased cooperation between the Chinese and
Iranian militaries]{.underline}, and particularly their navies. During
their meeting, Wu told Sayyari that in recent years, [China-Iran
bilateral relations have "continued healthy development," with a number
of high-level exchanges deepening mutual truest. Wu then called for
further progress in **strengthening military-to-military ties**,
**including more mutual exchanges**, ship visits, cooperative personnel
training **and technological cooperation.**]{.underline} Likewise,
[Defense Minister]{.underline} Chang praised the recent cooperation
between the two militaries and [called for further cooperation and
strengthening of military-to-military ties]{.underline}, Xinhua
reported. Sayyari responded by saying Iran is "ready to enhance
bilateral exchanges to push forward cooperation between the two armed
forces, especially in naval cooperation." Sayyari's visit to China comes
roughly a month after Chinese warships made their first ever port call
in Iran, which was also the first trip by Chinese military vessels to
the Persian Gulf. [The two nations conducted joint anti-piracy and
search-and-rescue exercises.]{.underline} That visit came after Iranian
vessels visited the Chinese post of Zhangjiagang in 2013. Remarks made
during Sayyari's visit confirm that more such exchanges and port calls
are very much on the cards. If this week's meetings are any indication,
[China-Iran military cooperation will become the new
normal.]{.underline} For China, closer ties with Iran are part of larger
trend of finding military partners outside the immediate Asia-Pacific
region. [Working under the imperative of embracing "new historic
missions," the PLA and the PLAN have being expanding their operations
abroad to match China's growing national interests.]{.underline}
Expanding the geographical reach of China's military requires willing
regional partners. [Iran is an particularly attractive candidate for
this cooperation due to its own military strength, its relative
stability, and its estrangement from the West]{.underline} (particularly
the U.S.). Better ties with Iran give China a window into the Middle
East, a region where its interests are rapidly growing as its appetite
for energy increases.

<https://www.hudson.org/research/14663-israel-and-china-take-a-leap-forward-but-to-where>
, November 5, 2018)

[One obvious risk has to do with China's continuing relationship with
Iran, from its dependence on Iranian oil and on the Iranian strategic
presence in the vital Hormuz Straits, to its ongoing support for Iran's
development of ballistic missiles, to its long history of enabling
Iran's nuclear program. At the same time, Israeli officials believe (or
hope) that they can influence Beijing to restrain Iran's missile
programs and curtail Tehran's support for terrorist groups in the
region. "Israel's approach to Sino-Iranian ties is defined by
realpolitik," remarks Sam Chester:]{.underline} Israeli leaders have
been quick to take advantage of the leverage Beijing has in Tehran, so
much so that in recent years China's support for restricting Iran's
nuclear program has been credited in part to intervention by
Israel---including threats by Israeli leaders that if left with no other
option, they will unilaterally attack Iran, a risk that would
destabilize Chinese objectives in the region. Ultimately, Chester
concludes[, Israel seeks sufficient influence "to obtain Beijing's
support against Iranian affiliates like Hizballah, Assad, and Hamas."
But it remains to be seen how much influence Israel actually can
wield]{.underline}. Certainly [its relationship with China hasn't led to
any significant change of Beijing's lockstep hostility to Israel's
management of the Palestinian issue.]{.underline} (With India, by
contrast, Israel has had greater success on this front.) Although
Netanyahu has voiced the expectation that closer ties would lead to a
friendlier China in the UN, so far that hasn't materialized, either. In
August, it was reported that China has offered to send troops to Syria
to help the Assad regime---another indication of Beijing's confidence
that it is free to pursue its geopolitical priorities as it alone sees
fit. [Another risk concerns Israel's ability to protect the intellectual
property of its leading companies and entrepreneurs. "China is notorious
for not respecting the intellectual-property laws of other nations,"
Jason McNew, founder of Stronghold Cyber Security, told the BBC in an
interview, "so Israel has to be very careful about what kind of
manufacturing they outsource to China."]{.underline} The Harpy incident
offers a good illustration here. Two decades after Israel sold the
original system to China, it was revealed that, at an international
defense exhibition in Abu Dhabi, the Chinese had unveiled their own
version of the killer anti-radar drone that bore an uncanny resemblance
to the original Israeli design. As an export item on the international
market, the new ASN-301 will be going head to head with its Israeli
forebear---with the added advantage of China's highly favorable
financing arrangements for foreign arms customers. [Nor, where bilateral
American and Israeli interests are concerned, has there been the
slightest check on other Chinese regional ambitions, preeminent among
them Beijing's keen interest in establishing a strategic foothold in the
eastern Mediterranean through the port of Haifa]{.underline}. China's
investment in Israel's largest port has reminded observers on the
American side not only that Beijing makes no distinction between
investment in military and investment in civilian infrastructure, but
that its vast military-modernization program, which has thoroughly
transformed the capabilities and battle readiness of its armed forces,
and whose geographic reach extends from artificially created islands in
the South China Sea to a naval base in Djibouti at the mouth of the Red
Sea, is focused among other areas on specifically maritime missions.
[For Washington, this is no small point. With the decline of the U.S.
Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, U.S. strategic interests have
depended more and more on cooperation with Israel's navy. Such
cooperation could be endangered if China's maritime presence
grows]{.underline}. As an Israeli participant at a recent Hudson
Institute conference cautioned: Israel is working itself out of . . .
cooperation \[with the U.S.\] because of the significant Chinese
presence and role in Israel's ports and the infrastructure that will be
in place there. If asked whether the U.S. should forward-deploy U.S.
Navy ships in Haifa port, which will be operated by the Chinese, I would
recommend against that. The Chinese port operators will be able to
monitor closely U.S. ship movements, be aware of maintenance activity,
and could have access to equipment moving to and from repair sites and
interact freely with our \[Israeli\] crews over protracted periods.
Significantly, the information systems and new infrastructure integral
to the ports and the likelihood of information- and
electronic-surveillance systems jeopardize U.S. information and
cybersecurity. The speaker, Shaul Chorev, a former deputy commander of
Israel's navy, is one voice in a small but growing chorus of retired
Israeli national-security officials warning that China's heavy
involvement in Israeli infrastructure projects could lead to conflict
with the United States. In late 2013, the former Mossad director Efraim
Halevy similarly argued that "China's holding the trans-Israel railway,
owning it and operating it, will not be understood by the U.S." He also
pointed to the danger of Chinese control of "political and economic
pressure points" within Israel. [Analogous worries are present in
Israel's financial sector and elsewhere in areas of public concern.
China's safety record on industrial projects, whether at home or abroad,
is less than reassuring.]{.underline} A few examples from the domestic
scene: the Wenzhou high-speed train collision in 2011 that killed 40 and
left 210 injured; the 2014 auto-parts factory fire in Kushan that killed
68; the 2015 explosion at a chemical storage plant in Tianjin that cost
173 lives; the Qingdao oil-pipeline disaster that left 62 people dead.
These hardly reflect well on the ability of Chinese companies to look
out for their own workers' welfare, let alone that of foreign citizens.
No wonder, then, that the Association of Contractors and Builders in
Israel has lobbied against Chinese involvement in construction and
infrastructure projects, while labor unions, for their part, are alarmed
that the Chinese workforce brought in for these projects will undercut
wages across the board. Where the Israeli government is concerned, [the
potential leverage over Israel's internal affairs gained by Chinese
companies and their masters in Beijing could become a source of serious
future friction that could in turn bear directly on the country's
security]{.underline}. Thus, Dorit Salinger of Israel's finance ministry
has repeatedly blocked the sale of the Phoenix and Clal insurance
companies to Chinese companies, citing fears of foreign control over
hundreds of billions of shekels of Israeli pension funds. As the
China-Israel nexus tightens, such concerns are only likely to grow.

### 1AC Trade 

#### Arms sales to Taiwan are souring trade talks now 

**Rapoza 2019** (Kenneth Rapoza-Senior Contributor Markets, "Taiwan Just
Became A Huge Variable In The China Trade War",

Washington knows how to do one thing well: pick a fight. [Potential
sales of F-16 fighter jets and M-1 Abrams tanks to Taiwan is a sure fire
way to tick off Xi Jinping, the Chinese president with whom Donald Trump
is trying to sign a "great trade deal"]{.underline} as early as this
month. Following another Steve Mnuchin/Robert Lighthizer lackluster
showing in Beijing last week, all bets are off that China and the U.S.
sign anything should the two presidents meet later this month as
discussed. Taiwan is a new sticking point. The U.S. hasn't sold fighter
jets to Taiwan since 1992 in an effort to appease China, which sees
Taiwan as a breakaway province designed to sow political discord between
Beijing and the West. Last week, the Trump administration responded to
the Taiwanese president's request for some of the biggest weapons made
in the U.S., saying he was fine with the order. The formal request still
needs congressional approval. Beijing will lobby hard against it before
Trump and Xi meet. No meeting date has been set. [Taiwan's request is an
unwelcome risk for ongoing U.S. China talks, says Chris Rogers, a senior
analyst for Panjiva, the trade research division of S&P Global Market
Intelligence.]{.underline} Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen seems willing
to ruffle feathers and challenge Trump, asking for the F-16 and the M-1
tank in order to "show the world the U.S. is committed to Taiwan's
defense," Reuters reports. "[Should the U.S. approve the orders it would
\... jeopardize relations between the U.S. and China just as trade talks
are due to reach a conclusion]{.underline}," Rogers says. [Defense
contractors will love this order. **Those who would like to see the
trade war end, won't love it as much.**]{.underline} Lockheed Martin
builds the F-16V model that the Taiwan Air Force is after. The M-1
Abrams tank is built by General Dynamics Land Systems and is used in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

#### Arms sales make trade negotiations untenable by creating deep mistrust 

**Yu 2018** (Xinyan Yu is a Senior Video Producer at the South China
Morning Post based in New York. She was formerly senior multimedia
producer at Inkstone based in Beijing. Previously, she was a producer at
BBC News. "Arms sales to Taiwan: Is the US provoking China?",

[The US State Department has approved an arms sales package worth \$330
million to Taiwan, further risking already strained ties with
China.]{.underline} The package includes spare parts for "F-16, C-130,
F-5, Indigenous Defense Fighter, all other aircraft systems and
subsystems, and other related elements of logistics and program
support," the Pentagon announced on Monday. [The US says arms sales to
the island democracy are intended to maintain stability in the region,
but China sees it as a violation of its sovereignty. Beijing claims
self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory. This is the second time the
US has sold arms to Taiwan under President Trump. Although the amount is
much smaller than the \$1.4 billion worth of arms sold to Taiwan last
year, it has coincided with a new round of US tariffs on Chinese
goods.]{.underline} "The question of timing is an interesting one
because the US' Taiwan Relations Act does not mandate any timing or
amount," says Eric Hundman, an assistant professor of political science
at NYU Shanghai. "This reads to me like that this administration is
really interested in putting pressure on China on a variety of fronts,
and this is just one tool in their kit," Hundman tells Inkstone. Why
sell arms to Taiwan? After the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, the
Chinese Communist Party took control of mainland China and the ousted
Kuomintang party retreated to the island of Taiwan. China now sees
Taiwan as a renegade province, and has not ruled out taking the island
by force. The US switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in
1979, but the same year it also signed the Taiwan Relations Act,
pledging to provide necessary weapons to the island for self-defense.
Washington still works with Taipei on an unofficial basis. "This
proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national
security of the United States by helping to improve the security and
defensive capability of the recipient, which has been and continues to
be an important force for political stability, military balance, and
economic progress in the region," the US Defense Security Cooperation
Agency said in a statement. Although China has vehemently protested
against arms sales to Taiwan -- and brought sanctions against countries
such as France for doing so -- the US has met its obligations over the
years. It is practically Taiwan's only source of imported weapons. What
do Taiwan and China think? [China sees the US arms sales as a huge
obstacle for unifying the country. It has raised the issue several
times.]{.underline} The two sides signed a separate communique in 1982,
in which the US promised not to engage in a long-term policy of arms
sales to Taiwan. Proponents of the sales have argued that the communique
is not legally binding, unlike the Taiwan Relations Act. But China sees
that 1979 law as America's excuse to meddle in its internal affairs.
[Taiwan has been ramping up its efforts to procure more arms and
equipment, as ties with China have worsened since President Tsai Ing-wen
took office in 2016. Tsai comes from a traditionally independence-minded
political party.]{.underline} President Tsai has called for
"normalization" of US arms sales, during a time when Beijing's repeated
military drills near Taiwan have posed a security threat. The proposed
arms deal gave Taiwan more confidence in the face of grave security
challenges, said Alex Huang, a spokesperson from the Taiwan Presidential
Office. He added that the sale would also help "maintain close dialogue
and cooperation with the United States in various issues, including
national security." What happens now? In a press conference on Tuesday,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang called for the US to
cancel the sale and end all Taiwan-related military activities as it has
violated international laws. "China has made a solemn representation to
the US," Geng said. "US arms sales to Taiwan have posed a serious threat
to China's sovereignty and security. Jia Xiudong, a research fellow at
the China Institute of International Studies, thinks arms sales to
Taiwan should not be overinterpreted. "**[America's China policies have
always been two-faced, but this is still another blow to Sino-US
relations that will deepen the mistrust in an ongoing trade
negotiation]{.underline}**," Jia tells Inkstone.

Indeed, [U.S. policy to Taiwan has become less predictable since
President Trump came to office. Many uncertainties, such as the power
struggle inside Trump's policy-making circle between the nationalists
and internationalists and the policy debates between the hardline and
moderate Republicans, have resulted in the unpredictability of Trump's
policy to Beijing as well as Taipei.]{.underline} However, against the
backdrop of the ongoing wide-range U.S. debates over Washington's China
policy in academic and policy circles over the policy of engagement and
hedging, one cannot help but link the decisions on Taiwan with U.S.
intentions to balance against a rising China. In other words, [the
Taiwan card will continue to be played by the Trump
administration]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [it is not unlikely that
President Trump may want to **"make a deal" with Beijing over Taiwan in
exchange of economic gains**]{.underline} as well as the Korean
Peninsula issue about which he is more concerned. As Raymond Burghardt
indicated, **[the U.S. Taiwan policy might be negotiable with Beijing
and used as strategic leverage for economic interests.]{.underline}**67
This worrisome speculation has increased Taiwanese concern of being
abandoned by Americans.

#### Trade war crushes the global economy---it causes widespread market panic and stifles growth 

**Ward 5/13** (Alex Ward-Staff Writer, International Security and
Defense, "Why China's new tariffs could make the US trade war even
worse",
<https://www.vox.com/2019/5/13/18617818/china-usa-trade-war-trump-tariff>
, May 13, 2019

[China is clearly unhappy about President Donald Trump's escalating
trade war --- and it just retaliated in a way that could hurt global
markets and further damage ties between the world's two biggest
economies.]{.underline} On Friday, Trump raised tariffs from 10 percent
to 25 percent on \$200 billion of Chinese goods after Washington and
Beijing failed to reach a long-sought trade deal despite days of intense
talks. China vowed to fight back, and officially did so Monday,
announcing it would increase its own tariffs on \$60 billion of American
products. Around 5,000 items will now have duties increased up to 25
percent; those penalties will go into effect on June 1, according to
China's finance ministry. "China's tariff move is in response to the US
unilateralism and trade protectionism," the ministry said in a Monday
statement. "China hopes that the US will return to the right track of
bilateral trade talks, work together with China and meet each other
halfway, to reach a win-win and mutually beneficial agreement on the
basis of mutual respect." [And there are signs that things could soon
get even worse: The Trump administration is considering upping tariffs
on all of China's remaining imports --- about \$300 billion worth of
products.]{.underline} These latest moves make two things perfectly
clear. First, the two countries aren't close to striking an accord that
would see China modify some of its trade laws in exchange for tariff
relief from the US. Second, [Washington and Beijing could soon have
little to no free trade between them --- stunting the global economy and
increasing prices for consumers and importers in the US. That last point
isn't just the view of multiple experts; it's also the view from some
inside the Trump administration. "Both sides will pay in these things,"
Larry Kudlow, one of Trump's top economic advisers, told Fox News on
Sunday.]{.underline} Why Trump wants to escalate the trade war [The
Trump administration's long-term strategic goal is to tank the Chinese
economy for the benefit of the US. By placing ever-increasing tariffs on
China, the hope is that fewer Americans buy its products and that
foreign companies leave that market and set up shop in other
countries.]{.underline} That aim has been implicit for months, but the
administration has recently made it extremely obvious. In the Sunday Fox
News interview, Kudlow noted the desired effect of the newly imposed
tariffs: "The Chinese will suffer GDP losses and so forth with respect
to a diminishing export market." And Trump himself tweeted that the
tariffs may force corporations to find a new home. "Many Tariffed
companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in
Asia," the president tweeted on Monday morning. \....completely avoided
if you by from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the
USA (the best idea). That's Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will
be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's
why China wants to make a deal so badly!\... --- Donald J. Trump
(@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2019 There's a bipartisan consensus that
China has taken advantage of the US economy for years, mainly by
stealing intellectual property and displacing millions of American jobs.
That's led to calls for the US government to curb Beijing's unfair trade
practices and ensure the US remains competitive in the global economy.
But trying to destroy China's entire economy is a pretty extreme way to
go about doing that, many experts say. Trump's misguided views about how
tariffs work are also likely playing a big role in the administration's
hardline approach. Trump insists that tariffs force China to pay money
to the US Treasury --- which just isn't true. When a tariff is placed on
a Chinese good, it is the company importing that product or a consumer
buying it who pays a higher price --- not China. In other words, these
tariffs are effectively a tax on Americans. But for whatever reason,
Trump continues to proclaim that tariffs are "paid to the United States
by China" and that they result in "billions" of dollars pouring into the
US Treasury. [And experts worry that his misguided strategic and
personal views on tariffs may end up seriously damaging the world
economy. "Trump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical
moment in his standoff with the Chinese," Chad Bown, a trade expert at
the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said
last week. "And American businesses and consumers stand to pay the
price."]{.underline} The first reactions to the growing trade standoff
aren't good [The world has visibly started to panic about the latest
US-China spat as global stocks tumbled on Monday]{.underline}. Here's
just a taste: Japan's Nikkei Index is down 0.7 percent. European stock
indexes fell by more than 1 percent. The Dow, a barometer for how well
the US stock market is doing, lost nearly 700 points. [It's of course
possible that the markets will rebound over time, but **these initial
numbers are certainly a sign of growing worldwide worry that the
US-China trade war will hurt the global economy**. An April report from
the International Monetary Fund, a world body that helps keep the global
economy stable, backs that sentiment by noting the spat will lead to job
losses in both countries. Which means that **unless the trade war ends
soon** --- an unlikely prospect --- **the world economy will be held
hostage by China's malfeasance and Trump's misguided
views.**]{.underline}

warned]{.underline} Tuesday, cutting its forecast for this year and next

from a clash between the world´s two biggest economies. At a meeting on

economies]{.underline} especially **[vulnerable to sudden
stresses]{.underline}**. \"There is no denying that **[the

IMF´s top economist]{.underline} Maurice Obstfeld [told
reporters]{.underline} after the fund cut its outlook for global GDP
growth by 0.2 percentage points to 3.7 percent for 2018 and 2019. It is
the first time the fund has cut its forecast in more than two years.
[Tensions]{.underline} have [soared]{.underline} in recent months
[with]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline}´s administration [rolling
out billions of dollars in tariffs]{.underline} [against
China]{.underline} in a bid to tackle its trade deficit and rein in what

[with]{.underline} its own barrage of [levies]{.underline}, **[rattling
nerves]{.underline}** [especially among other Asian
economies]{.underline} and already vulnerable countries like Argentina,
Turkey and Brazil. \"Trade policy reflects politics and politics remains
unsettled in several countries, posing further risks,\" Obstfeld said.
[The dominant US economy has been shielded so far]{.underline} from the
ill effects of the trade war, thanks to stimulus through tax cuts and
spending policies, **[but that will wear off by 2020]{.underline}**, the
IMF said. When the world´s two biggest economies are \"at odds\",
Obstfeld said, that is going to create \"a situation where everyone is
going to suffer\". [Growth estimates for the euro]{.underline} area and
Britain [were also revised down]{.underline} with the report warning
that growth \"may have peaked in some major economies\". Finance
ministers and central bankers from many of the IMF´s 189 member nations
are meeting in Bali this week with talk of rising protectionism taking
centre stage. The IMF report said \"[protectionist rhetoric\" was being
\"increasingly turned into action]{.underline}\", warning **[such
uncertainty]{.underline}** \"[could lead firms to postpone or **forgo
capital spending**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} hence **[slow down
growth]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[investment]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[demand]{.underline}**.\" Global trade is projected
to expand by 4.2 percent this year \-- 0.6 percent less than expected in
July \-- dropping to four percent next year. Obstfeld, who retires from
the Fund later this year, said there were bright spots with some Latin
American and African nations getting growth forecast upgrades. The fund
urged governments to focus on policies that can share the benefits of
growth more widely, helping counter the growing mistrust of
institutions, and to avoid \"protectionist reactions to structural
change.\" And it stressed \"cooperative solutions\" to help boost
continued growth in trade \"remain essential to preserve and extend the
global expansion\". [With US]{.underline} GDP [growth expected to

potential risk of an **\"inflation surprise\",**]{.underline} [fuelled
by the same tax cuts and rising spending used to cushion the impact from
the trade war. That could result in **higher**-than-expected **interest
rates**]{.underline} from the Federal Reserve [and **stock market
uncertainty.**]{.underline} Fed rate hikes are already increasing
pressure on emerging market economies by fuelling an outflow of capital
as investors seek higher returns. [US stimulus also adds to the
\"already-unsustainable\" debt and deficit that will undercut future
growth]{.underline}, the report warned. In export-heavy China, which is
less able to mitigate the fallout from tariffs, the trade war is already
having an impact, the IMF said. Growth is projected to slow to 6.6
percent this year and 6.2 percent in 2019, a downgrade of 0.2 percentage
points. Further out, China´s economic growth is expected to slow
gradually to 5.6 percent as the government shifts to \"a more
sustainable growth path\" and addresses financial risks, the IMF said.

#### [Only]{.underline} stock market crashes can cause [major depressions]{.underline}\-\--empirical analysis proves\-\--these collapses are [especially prone]{.underline} to cause war

5\. Conclusions and future research

[The]{.underline} **[long-term history]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[30 countries]{.underline}** [indicates that stock-market
crashes]{.underline} (cumulative real returns of --0.25 or worse)
[have]{.underline} **[substantial predictive power]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} **[depressions]{.underline}** (cumulative
macroeconomic declines by 10 percent or more). In a non-war environment,
[the realization of a stock-market return of --0.25 or worse implies
that the probability of a]{.underline} minor [depression]{.underline}
(macroeconomic decline by 10 percent or more) [is 22
percent]{.underline}, and the probability of a major depression (decline
by 25 percent or more) is 3 percent. [When the stock return is --0.40 or
worse]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} [corresponding depression
probabilities are]{.underline} [30 percent]{.underline} and 4 percent.
[The probabilities are]{.underline} **[46 percent]{.underline}** and 8
percent, respectively, [when a stock-market crash of --0.25 or
worse]{.underline} in a non-war period [is accompanied by a]{.underline}
**[currency or banking crisis]{.underline}** and occurs during a time of
global economic turmoil. Given the stock-market crashes for the United
States and other countries in 2008 (characterized as non-war, featuring
a currency or banking crisis, and occurring during a global event),
these last probabilities applied at the beginning of 2009.

[The]{.underline} **[long-term data]{.underline}** [also show that
the]{.underline} **[majority]{.underline}** (**[67
percent]{.underline}**) [of]{.underline} minor, non-war [depressions are
accompanied by stock-market crashes]{.underline}, [whereas]{.underline}
**[most major]{.underline}**, non-war [depressions]{.underline} (**[83
percent]{.underline}**) [are accompanied by these crashes]{.underline}.
Therefore, [in the]{.underline} **[absence of a stock-market
crash]{.underline}**, [the occurrence of a depression is]{.underline}
**[highly unlikely]{.underline}**.

[The full history of]{.underline} **[3037 annual
observations]{.underline}** [reveals]{.underline} **[71 matched
cases]{.underline}** [of stock-market crashes and
depressions]{.underline}, [of which]{.underline} **[41 percent are
associated with war]{.underline}**. The years contained in the 71 cases
constitute 12 percent of the overall sample (because the average
duration of a crisis was 4.9 years). The co-movement between stock
returns and macroeconomic changes for the 71 cases may be sufficient to
explain the observed equity premium of 7 percent, assuming that the
coefficient of relative risk aversion is between 3.5 and 4. The required
coefficient falls to 3.5 or less if we bring in the additional 19
percent of the sample that features a stock-market crash or depression
but not both. A crucial aspect of this analysis is that the computed
covariances allow for a flexible timing pattern between stock returns
and macroeconomic changes. In future research, we plan to assess this
flexible covariance approach in more detail. Part of this research
involves the roles of missing data and wartime price controls, which can
distort the covariances calculated from a rigid timing structure.

#### Even if the relative impact of tariffs is small, uncertainty and knock off effects of the trade war wreck consumer buying power, cause supply chain disruptions, and massively reduce capital expenditure

hidden danger of Trump\'s trade war with China", Business Insider,

, 9/25/2018)

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has some concerns about President Donald
Trump\'s trade war with China. On the same day that a 10% tariff on
\$200 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect --- adding to the
tariffs on \$50 billion worth of goods that were already in place ---
[Dimon warned that the problems with the \"trade skirmish\" were **not
limited to** the **direct cost increases** from the duties]{.underline}.
During a Monday interview with CNBC, Dimon said that while the tariffs
were a \"tax on America,\" [the real danger would come from
**companies\' responses**]{.underline} to the cost increases.
\"Remember, people do other things,\" Dimon said. \"They have other
supply lines. But it\'s a \$20 trillion economy. So that is a negative.
[The real negative isn\'t that --- it\'s **confidence**,
consistency]{.underline}. [If people start reducing investment, if
people start moving their supply chains around, that we have seen
already moves the markets a little bit]{.underline}.\" Dimon\'s point is
that [while the **direct effects** of the tariffs]{.underline} ---
higher costs for businesses and higher prices for consumers--- [may
produce a **slight growth lag**]{.underline}, [the larger disruption
would come from the tariffs\' **second-order effects**.]{.underline} The
**[uncertainty]{.underline}** [over trade policy is already becoming an
undercurrent in **business and consumer-confidence**
measures]{.underline}, the latest being a survey of 141 US CEOs by
Business Roundtable released Monday. (Dimon is the group\'s chairman.)
Roughly two-thirds of the [executives]{.underline} surveyed said they
[believed the tariffs would be a moderate or significant drag on their
companies\' **capital-spending plans**]{.underline}. \"Current trade
policies and uncertainty about future trade policies are having negative
effects, [especially on capital investment]{.underline},\" Joshua
Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, said in a release. \"[Decreases
in capital investment not only impact the operations]{.underline} of
Business Roundtable companies, [**less spending** on equipment and
facilities also **squeezes small- and medium-sized** suppliers and the
**millions of Americans** they employ]{.underline}.\" In turn, [the slip
in confidence and uncertainty around trade policy could cause firms to
**delay investment or hiring**]{.underline}. [Or they could decide to
**move** their **supply** **chains** to an area less affected by the
tariffs]{.underline}. The most notable example of a supply-chain shift
was Harley-Davidson, which announced earlier this year that it would
move some of its production overseas to avoid the European Union\'s
retaliateory tariffs on American motorcycles. As more and more
businesses start to grapple with the tariffs, several may also decide to
shift manufacturing out of the US to avoid the trade upheaval. [A
cascade of moves could present more of a **problem** for the **US
economy** than the price increases.]{.underline} While these changes are
theoretical, Dimon said that further escalation of the trade conflict
could end up canceling out some of the more beneficial parts of Trump\'s
economic policy. \"We really don\'t think it\'s a great way to go about
it,\" Dimon said. \"It could easily offset some of the benefits that
we\'ve seen from regulatory reform and tax reform.\"

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how [economic
considerations within states can figure **prominently into the calculus
for future conflicts**]{.underline}. The findings also suggest that
[security issues with economic or financial underpinnings will transcend
classical determinants of war and conflict, and change the manner by
which rival states engage in hostile acts toward one
another]{.underline}. The research shows that [security concerns
emanating from economic uncertainty and the inherent vulnerabilities

security, and provide developing states new asymmetric options for

areas]{.underline}, identified in the proceeding chapters, [are likely
to mature into **global security threats** in the immediate

potential risks associated with **stolen or loose WMD**]{.underline},
[resulting from poor security, can also pose a threat to U.S. national

show how [financial constraints affect weapons security making weapons
vulnerable to theft, and how financial factors can influence WMD
proliferation]{.underline} by contributing to the motivating factors
behind a trusted insider's decision to sell weapons technology. The
[inherent vulnerabilities within the global financial markets will
provide terrorists' organizations and other non-state
groups]{.underline}, who object to the current international system or

#### Trump is uniquely likely to divert\-\--that goes nuclear

[As well as mapping out the US's current nuclear weapons
policies]{.underline} and its regional relationships, [it is important
to reflect upon how domestic political dynamics under a Trump presidency
might]{.underline} **[drive Washington's behaviour
internationally]{.underline}**, [particularly given the]{.underline}
**[nuclear shadow]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[always hangs over
conflicts involving the US.]{.underline}**

For example, [in the near-term]{.underline}, [Trump's economic plan and
the]{.underline} **[great expectations]{.underline}** [amongst the
American working class that have been generated]{.underline}, [may
have]{.underline} **[particularly dangerous consequences]{.underline}**
if, as seems likely, the primary beneficiaries are the very wealthy.
[Reviewing Trump's economic plans]{.underline}, [Martin
Wolf]{.underline} of the Financial Times [concludes that 'the
longer-term consequences are likely to be grim, not least for his angry,
but fooled, supporters]{.underline}. [Next time, they might be even
angrier. Where that might lead is terrifying']{.underline}. Gillian Tett
has also highlighted the 'real risks' that [Trump's policies could
'spark]{.underline} [**US social unrest** or **geopolitical
uncertainty'**]{.underline}. Elsewhere, George Monbiot in the Guardian,
makes the stark assertion that [the inability of the US]{.underline} and
other governments [to respond effectively to public anger means he now
believes that]{.underline} '[we will see]{.underline} **[war between the
major powers]{.underline}** within my lifetime'.

If these warnings weren't troubling enough, no less a figure than Henry
Kissinger argued on BBC's Newsnight that 'the more likely reaction' to a
Trump presidency from terror groups 'will be to do something that evokes
a reaction' from Washington in order to 'widen the split' between it and
Europe and damage the US's image around the world. Given that Trump has
already vowed to 'bomb the shit out of ISIS' and refused to rule out the
use of nuclear weapons against the group, it goes without saying that
such a scenario could have the gravest consequences and must be avoided
so that the US does not play into the terrorists' hands.

Looking more widely, President-elect Trump's existing and potential
cabinet appointments, which Glenn Greenwald has summarised as
'empowering...by and large...the traditional, hard, hawkish right-wing
members of the Republican Party' also point to the US engaging in future
overseas conflicts, rather than the isolationism which many in the
foreign policy establishment criticised Trump for proposing during the
presidential campaign. William Hartung and Todd Harrison have drawn
attention to the fact that defence spending under Trump could be almost
\$1trillion (spread over ten years) more than Obama's most recent budget
request. Such projections, alongside Trump's election rhetoric, suggest
that the new nuclear monarch will try to push wide open the door to more
spending on nuclear weapons and missile defense, a situation made
possible, as we have seen, by Obama's inability to implement progressive
change in this area at a time of persistent Republican obstruction.

Conclusion

The problem now, for the US and the world, is that if
[Trump]{.underline} does make good on his campaign promises then this
[will have several damaging consequences for international peace and
security]{.underline} [and]{.underline} that [if Trump does not
sufficiently satisfy his supporters]{.underline} [then this will likely
pour fuel on the flames at home]{.underline}, [which may
then]{.underline} **[quickly spread abroad]{.underline}**. The people of
the US and the world thus now have a huge responsibility to act as a
restraining influence and ensure that the US retains an accountable,
transparent and democratic government. This responsibility will only
grow [if]{.underline} [**crises or shocks take place** in]{.underline}
or outside [the US]{.underline} [which ambitious and]{.underline}
**[extremist figures take advantage of]{.underline}**, [framing them as
threats to national security in order to protect their interests and
power]{.underline}. [If such scenarios emerge the next
administration]{.underline} and its untried and untested
[President]{.underline} [will find themselves with]{.underline} a range
of extremely powerful tools and institutional experience at their
disposal, including **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, [which may
prove]{.underline} **[too tempting to resist]{.underline}** [when
figuring out how to respond to widespread anger, confusion and
unrest]{.underline}, both [at home]{.underline} and abroad.

### [Monetary Policy I/L]{.underline} 

#### Tax cuts and growing public debt means there is no room to buffer shocks with monetary policy

Sam **Fleming**, **10-15**-18, (US economics editor, "US budget deficit
hits \$779bn in Trump's first full fiscal year", Financial Times,
https://www.ft.com/content/c8a990d8-d0a5-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5)

The US budget deficit widened to a six-year high of \$779bn during
Donald Trump's first full fiscal year in the White House as borrowing
swelled despite surging economic growth.

[The deficit grew by \$113bn from the previous year]{.underline},
reaching 3.9 per cent of US gross domestic product in the fiscal year
ended September 30. That compared with 3.5 per cent the previous year
and was above the 40-year average of 3.2 per cent, according to a report
from the US Treasury and Office of Management and Budget. [The figures
will intensify concerns about]{.underline} the [vast
deficits]{.underline} the US government is running [during an economic
boom that has driven unemployment]{.underline} [to its lowest
levels]{.underline} since the late 1960s. [Tax reductions pushed through
at the end of 2017, coupled with higher public spending]{.underline}
agreed by Congress early this year, [are set to push up **public debt**
at a **rapid pace**]{.underline}, [triggering concerns that there will
be **less room** for **fiscal stimulus** when the **US next enters a
downturn**.]{.underline} The Congressional Budget Office has predicted
that under current laws, [public debt is on course to reach its highest
levels relative to GDP in US history over the coming 30
years]{.underline}. Yet months before his election, Mr Trump claimed
that he would pay off the US national debt in eight years, while his
fellow Republicans ran on platforms of fiscal restraint in 2016. 

#### That means shocks are particularly threatening

**Geithner 17** (January/February, Tim, former Treasury Secretary, "Are
We Safe Yet?",

THE SHRINKING SPACE FOR POLICY

[A country's ability to limit the intensity of a financial crisis also
depends on how much room for maneuver its fiscal- and monetary-policy
makers enjoy]{.underline}. Today, **[that room has shrunk in most of the
major developed economies]{.underline}**. **[Public debt as a share of
GDP has soared]{.underline}**. The [overnight rates]{.underline} at
which central banks lend money [have fallen **close to
zero**]{.underline}, and in some countries, they have dipped into the
negative. The costs of long-term government borrowing have also fallen
to record lows. And [credit spreads]{.underline}---the difference
between government and corporate borrowing costs---[have
narrowed]{.underline}. [In terms of their ability to raise spending and
lower interest rates, governments have less ammunition]{.underline}.

As far as monetary policy goes, the experience with negative rates so
far is not that promising. Many central banks fear that negative rates
have hurt rather than helped the economy, and even those that believe
they have helped worry that rates cannot fall much further before they
start to backfire. [On the fiscal side, almost all the major economies
have less room for stimulus than before the crisi]{.underline}s. And
where there is still room, the **[political constraints on using it may
prove hard to overcome]{.underline}**. The only remaining untried tactic
is the more coordinated deployment of expansionary fiscal and monetary
policy. Perhaps that will prove possible, and if so, perhaps the impact
will be powerful. But it's hard to say.

[The Federal Reserve]{.underline}, for its part, still [has more room
for maneuver in terms of monetary policy than other major central banks
do. It could push long-term interest rates lower]{.underline} in a
crisis. [But even in mild recessions, the Fed has typically had to lower
borrowing rates by three to five percentage points, and **it does not
have that room today**]{.underline}.

[The United States also has less fiscal capacity than it did before the
crisis. From 2007 to the end of 2009, the debt-to-GDP ratio increased
from roughly 35 percent to 75 percent]{.underline}, where it remains
today. Most of this increase owed to lower tax revenues caused by the
recession and to the jump in spending that occurred as automatic fiscal
stabilizers, such as unemployment benefits, took effect. These costs
would have soared even higher in the absence of the stimulus package and
the financial rescue. In fact, rather than costing the five to ten
percent of GDP that many expected, the rescue earned a modest positive
financial return for the public. The stimulus was designed to be
temporary and was quickly wound down. The federal deficit fell from its
peak of ten percent of GDP in 2009 to around three percent, where it has
stayed since 2014. Still, [the debt-to-GDP ratio remains close to its
postcrisis peak, and absent changes in policy, it will rise in the
coming years]{.underline}.

The bottom line is that [even though policymakers still have some
remaining room to maneuver, they have much less than they did on the eve
of previous economic downturns]{.underline}. [There is no reassuring
precedent for the present diminished state of the U.S. fiscal and
monetary arsenal]{.underline}. **[The Fed has no experience navigating
through a substantial shock to private demand without the ability to
lower interest rates substantially and quickly]{.underline}**. [Most of
the burden in responding to a crisis would therefore fall on fiscal
policy, where the political constraints on action still seem
daunting]{.underline}. [The same story has played out in most advanced
economies, and the implications are troubling. **A shock could cause
greater damage, last longer, and spread wider**]{.underline}.

#### Clary is a dyad-level analysis, but that is [academic garbage]{.underline} and should be rejected.

2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00538.pdf)

**[It is not valid to use dyadic methods]{.underline}** [in the face of
hyperdyadic generative processes]{.underline} [to draw]{.underline}
model-based [inferences]{.underline}. Model based inferences are only as
accurate as the statistical model specification, and to relegate one's
specification to the class of dyadic independence models is to erect an
artificial barrier to sound model specification and inferenece. A
researcher may tolerate the use of an inferior class of statistical
models in order to ease computational burdens, but such tolerance is a
purely individual and subjective question, which is beyond the focus of
our current commentary. Dyadic design is widespread, but we cannot
quantify the extent to which false inferences have been made without
individually replicating each analysis; we can be mathematically
confident that all/most include some level of bias. The question then
becomes how much stock should we put in results that are known to be
biased? We do not believe that acknowledging the bias to readers and
moving on is sufficient because the degree of bias is unquantified. Just
like in a 12-step program, admitting you have a problem is important,
but is not enough on its own.

[We argued that]{.underline} [dyadic design is]{.underline}
**[problematic]{.underline}** [from both a]{.underline} **[theoretical
and empirical perspective]{.underline}**. To summarize, [we can only
expect unbiased statistical results in]{.underline} **[extremely
unlikely situations]{.underline}**, such as dyads not depending on one
another in any way beyond the conditioning on relational measures within
the dyad, [and]{.underline} **[even in such situations]{.underline}**,
[dyadic design imposes a strong and usually]{.underline}
**[substantively untenable set of assumptions]{.underline}**. We believe
that [these assumptions will]{.underline} **[rarely if ever be
met]{.underline}** [in interesting international politics
applications]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, when they do not cause
bias or model misspecification, [these assumptions result in treatments
of the data that are]{.underline} **[wildly unrealistic]{.underline}**
[to even the analyst with the most basic knowledge of
geopolitics.]{.underline}

Where does this leave us? [We are of the opinion,]{.underline} and hope
that the reader will also have been convinced by this discussion, that
[dyadic design is]{.underline} [nearly]{.underline} **[never appropriate
for international relations]{.underline}** [theory or data]{.underline}.
The critical reader may convince herself that one or even several of the
points mentioned above do not apply to her data or problem, but [we
would have to be]{.underline} **[outright wrong about every
point]{.underline}** we made above [in order for dyadic design to be
superior to other easily available approaches]{.underline}. [We
see]{.underline} **[reason to doubt many published
results]{.underline}** [based on dyadic design]{.underline}, we do not
believe that our critique should be cause for despair in the community
of international relations scholars. Rather, the development of
empirical tools that can account for nearly arbitrarily complex forms of
interdependence present the opportunity for great strides to be made in
international relations theory. Our previous work in this area would
suggest, for example, that triadic closure (ties between all dyads in
the ijk triple) is very common in positively valanced (e.g., a tie is a
"good" thing) networks like alliances (Cranmer et al., 2012b,a) and very
uncommon in negatively valanced networks like conflict (Cranmer and
Desmarais, 2011). A wide variety of similar processes may be at work in
international phenomena and are waiting to be discovered. We believe
that the field of international relations is on the cusp of a revolution
in how we treat complexity, both theoretically and empirically, and we
look forward to an exciting period of innovation as such
complexity-oriented approaches permeate the field.

#### Economic decline causes war

**Posen 18** (Adam Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for
International Economics, "The Post-American World Economy," Foreign
Affairs, March/April 2018)

[The]{.underline} United States' [motivation for building the postwar
economic system was as much **preventing conflict** as **promoting
growth**. In setting out]{.underline} the [rules]{.underline} by which
all members would conduct business, [the architects]{.underline} of the
system [hoped to **separate economic from military competition**. U.S.
withdrawal **need not result in economic** or **physical wars**, but it
will **raise the risk of stumbling into conflict by accident**. Without
**agreed-on rules**, even **minor economic disputes** have the potential
to **set off escalating counterattacks**. If the norm of separation
between economic and military confrontations breaks down, **economic
frictions**, such as **Chinese theft of i**]{.underline}ntellectual
**[p]{.underline}**roperty [or **restrictions on trade** with a
**nuclear Iran** or **North Korea**, could turn into **outright
conflict**. It is plausible that **as the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**retreats** and thereby **weakens its
economy**]{.underline}, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [will
**blame the economic damage** not on its own actions but on **foreign
governments**, creating a **self-perpetuating cycle of anger**. When
other major countries **step forward** to preserve the]{.underline} open
economic [order, or **defend themselves**]{.underline} against U.S.
economic aggression, [Washington may interpret that as an **attack on
U.S. primacy**]{.underline}. The Trump administration might even
misinterpret the current forbearance by China or the EU as a sign of
weakness [and an **invitation to escalate confrontations**]{.underline}.
Today, [a **smaller share of the world's population than ever** lives in
poverty]{.underline}, and a larger share than ever lives a middle-class
existence. This is not solely the result of China's astonishing rise. In
Chile, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, and the
countries of the former Soviet Union, [economic growth has **brought
hundreds of millions of people** out of what amounted to subsistence or
little better. This miracle took place **without conquest** or **even
much conflict**, and with greater protections for]{.underline} private
property and [human rights]{.underline} than ever before. [The liberal
order **constructed and led by the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[made such progress possible]{.underline}**
by giving countries, businesses, and individuals the opportunity to
build their economic lives without fear of a foreign power taking away
what they had made. That U.S. leadership has not, as some have charged,
hurt the United States. The country's rampant inequality and wage
stagnation are largely the result of domestic political choices and
failures. [A world in which the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
**[ceases to lead]{.underline}**---[or]{.underline}, worse still,

to relevant regions, extend to the whole world]{.underline}," Dai
Xianglong, a former governor of the People's Bank of China, said Friday
morning at a press event in Beijing hosted by think tank China Center
for International Economic Exchanges. "[If the China-U.S. trade war
continues to grow larger, it may cause the global economy to decline,
and may cause a global financial crisis]{.underline}," he said in
Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. [Retaliatory tariffs from
China on \$60 billion worth of U.S. goods are set to take effect
Saturday, June 1. It comes in response to President Donald Trump's
decision to raise duties on \$200 billion in Chinese products to 25%
from 10%. The trade dispute between the world's two largest economies
has roiled global markets for months with worries about the negative
impact on growth. As negotiations took a turn for the worse this month,
the S&P 500 fell more than 5% --- on track for its first negative month
since December. The]{.underline} Shanghai composite has struggled to
climb, hovering near 2,900 after breaking above the psychologically key
3,000 level earlier this year. Dai, who was PBOC governor from 1995 to
2002, said Friday that he expects the Shanghai composite will rise
steadily above the 3,000 level, helped by China's coming market reforms.
The index traded mildly lower, near 2,898, on Friday afternoon. The
former central bank chief also attributed recent weakness in the yuan to
the market's reaction to trade tensions, while noting that Beijing would
not devalue the currency in response. He said that fundamentals, such as
economic growth and foreign exchange reserves, support a stable yuan.

### Trade Turns Deterrence 

#### Trade war crushes the Taiwanese economy---flips their deterrence arguments

It has been speculated that [the fallout from the trade war between
China and the US will have a negative impact on the economic wellbeing
of adjacent stakeholders. Of these, the most concerning is
Taiwan.]{.underline} US president Donald Trump has already ordered 25
per cent tariffs on the next \$325bn of goods, the bulk of which are
mobile phones and tablets. [Taiwanese manufacturers in both supply
chains account for a large proportion. Taiwan is a small, island economy
stuck between the world's two largest. No one knows how long this trade
war will last. Taiwan will be the country other than China that is
significantly affected by the next wave of the trade war.]{.underline}

[The story of the past few days in news has become clear: **It was
America versus its allies.**]{.underline} After President Trump's
meeting with Kim Jong Un, [Trump announced that he would be
**suspending**]{.underline} joint military exercises --- "the **[war
games]{.underline}**," as he put it --- [with **South Korea**, as a
gesture of goodwill toward the North. This seems to have come as a
**shock to America's allies in Seoul**]{.underline}: South Korean
President Moon Jae-in's office released a statement saying "we need to
find out the precise meaning or intentions of President Trump's
remarks," implying [they had **no idea this was coming**]{.underline}.
[The weekend before, at the G7]{.underline} summit, a confab for leaders
of seven wealthy democracies, [Trump got into a **fight
with**]{.underline} Canadian Prime Minister Justin
**[Trudeau]{.underline}** [over]{.underline} **[trade]{.underline}**.
[When Trudeau criticized Trump's imposition of new tariffs on steel and
aluminum imports --- saying "Canadians did not take it lightly" ---
Trump called him "very **dishonest and weak**"]{.underline} on Twitter.
Peter **[Navarro]{.underline}**, one of his top trade advisers,
[said]{.underline} on Fox News that [there was "a **special place in
hell" for Trudeau**. These two incidents aren't the only times Trump has
infuriated American allie]{.underline}s in the past year. [Just last
month, he pulled the United States out of the **Iran**]{.underline}
nuclear **[deal]{.underline}** --- a painstakingly negotiated agreement
[involving]{.underline} several of America's top
**[European]{.underline}** [allies. Last June, he withdrew
from]{.underline} the **[Paris]{.underline}** climate agreement. [And
this all came amid constant **carping**]{.underline} [about how
America's **NATO** allies needed to **pay their "fair
share,"**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} after Trump's [past musings
about how he might not defend allies if they didn't. Trump's
betrayal]{.underline} of South Korea and eruption at Trudeau
[are]{.underline} **[not one-offs]{.underline}**, or events you can
write off as simple quirks of the president's personality. [It is part
of a broader slate of Trump **policies and diplomatic
efforts**]{.underline} [that have, put together, **fundamentally
weakened America's ties with its traditional allies**]{.underline} ---
in ways that could have potentially disastrous consequences for the
world. America's alliances depend on the US's reputation for upholding
its agreements and treating its allies fairly. Trump's blithe disregard
for diplomacy and international agreements has damaged the US's
reputation in a way that some scholars worry may be irreparable. And a
deep body of research on international relations suggests that the
strength of America's alliances in Europe and East Asia have played a
pivotal role in preventing another world war. The more Trump mucks
around with American alliances, the more unstable the world becomes ---
making a large military conflict more imaginable. Such a disaster
hopefully will never happen. Indeed, it's nearly impossible for most of
us to imagine one happening now: We live in one of the most peaceful
times in human history, with some of the lowest rates of deaths in
conflict ever recorded. But that's precisely the point: Our age is such
an anomaly when it comes to conflict that we aren't entirely sure what
could trigger a return to the violent historical norm. Serious, lasting
damage to the American-led alliance system might do the trick. And
President [Trump's]{.underline} foreign policy could well be doing such
damage. His [approach is **so erratic**, so contemptuous of America's
traditional way of doing business, that US allies are **openly
worrying** in a way that we haven't seen in modern history. This
**affects world politics at their most fundamental level**, undermining
an otherwise stable global system in ways that we are only dimly capable
of perceiving. The past week's news was a particularly naked
demonstration of what had been, to date, one of the most subtle and
insidious effects of the Trump presidency: an erosion of the foundations
of the political system that defines --- and protects --- the modern
world. Trump is attacking the]{.underline} **[heart of American
alliances: trust]{.underline}** In 1956, a leaked Defense Department
memo proposing the withdrawal of US troops from Europe terrified
European allies; German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer declared privately
that "NATO is finished." The Nixon administration's diplomatic outreach
to China in 1972 led both Japanese and South Korean policymakers to fear
that the US would cut ties to curry favor with Beijing. Seoul even began
a covert nuclear weapons program to defend itself in the event of
American abandonment. These examples illustrate a common historical
pattern: Alliances between a stronger state and weaker partners become
at risk of collapse when the weaker state no longer feels like it can
trust the stronger state. "An alliance may dissolve if its members begin
to question whether their partners are genuinely committed to providing
assistance," Harvard scholar Stephen Walt writes in a 1997 survey of the
historical record. "This problem will be more severe when \... there is
a large asymmetry of power among the member-states." The US has
prevented allies from truly losing faith in the past basically by
reassuring them. Presidents promise allies that they'd never abandon
them, and provide them tangible goods --- like US troop deployments to
their country, military assistance, or even trade agreements --- to
demonstrate America's continuing commitment. America's history of
managing allies speaks to a fundamental truth about these agreements:
They are grounded entirely in trust. Ultimately, an alliance is nothing
but a promise: that the United States will defend its allies, either in
Europe or East Asia, in the event of an unspecified future attack.
There's nothing an ally can do to force the United States into defending
them; they just have to take America's word for it. As a result, a
country's reputation for treating its allies well is crucially important
to determining whether its alliances can work. A 2008 paper by Douglas
Gibler, a professor at the University of Alabama, found that states that
did not honor their commitment to allies in the past were considerably
less likely to forge new alliances in the future. Trade pacts,
environmental agreements, and the Iran nuclear deal don't touch the core
US promise in US military alliances --- to defend allies in the event of
an attack. But backing out of such accords does serious damage to
Trump's reputation as a trustworthy ally. Withdrawing the United States
from major agreements and imposing tariffs on allies, all while cozying
up to Vladimir Putin and sitting down with Kim Jong Un, tells US allies
that Trump doesn't feel particularly bound by formal agreements or the
traditional thrust of US foreign policy. If he decides that an agreement
doesn't put "America First," he's perfectly willing to kick it to the
curb. [Trump]{.underline} has **[openly said]{.underline}** this in the
past. In July 2016, he told the New York Times that [he
would]{.underline} be willing to **[disregard Article 5]{.underline}**,
the provision of NATO's founding treaty committing allies to defending
each other in the event of the attack. "If we are not going to be
reasonably reimbursed for the tremendous cost of protecting these
massive nations with tremendous wealth ... then yes, I would be
absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will
be defending yourself,'" Trump told the Times. Trump has
**[tried]{.underline}** [to walk back]{.underline} that kind of rhetoric
as president. [But his **actions**]{.underline} in the past year ---
[especially the snap cancellation of longstanding military exercises
with South Korea --- make the threat of abandonment **seem all too
credible to allies**]{.underline}. When NPR asked Tomas Valasek, the
recently retired Slovak ambassador to NATO, if Trump would defend his
country or another ally in the event of an attack, he couldn't bring
himself to say yes. "The honest answer is none of us quite knows,"
Valasek said. "His heart is not into alliance. He has a zero-sum view of
the world. He believes in no permanent friendships, no permanent allies.
You know, that's not the sort of mindset that prepares him well for sort
of standing by the side of an ally in case of a crisis." [The result of
Trump's reputation for unreliability, then, is a weakening of American
alliances. Allies will trust the United States less, and may start
**look**ing for alternatives]{.underline} to depending so heavily on the
United States. Enemies will see cracks in US alliances and may attempt
to exploit them. "The liberal international order depends on us
believing that agreements like treaties \[and\] international
organizations have long-term staying power beyond leadership change,"
Brett Ashley Leeds, a scholar of US alliances at Rice University, tells
me. "The scariest part is the fact that \[Trump\] is creating so much
uncertainty about what US policy is going to be."

[A related argument concerning]{.underline} the fate of US alliances in
the Asia-Pacific region is made that any kind of
[reunification]{.underline} between the Mainland and Taiwan [would
signal a "death blow" to the US-Japan Alliance, and other
allies]{.underline} would also be dubious of the US commitment to the
region's security. [However,]{.underline} both arguments turn out to be
specious---having been built on crude and simplistic assumptions[. A
clear view of history shows plainly that Beijing approaches the Taiwan
issue quite differently than other issues]{.underline}, and so the
expectation that China, following unification, would immediately seek to
apply its hubris to other issues only stretches the imagination. [The
"Munich" appeasement argument also seems to be ignorant of geography,
neglecting the fact that Taiwan's defense is not feasible over the long
term]{.underline}. White quite correctly concludes: "[America can no
longer defend Taiwan from China]{.underline}, and a policy towards
Taiwan that presumes that it can is unsustainable."68 Even putting
military capabilities aside, as [Nathan and Scobell relate, "Beijing is
convinced that it enjoys an asymmetry of motivation over the United
States with respect to Taiwan.]{.underline}"69 Moreover, a Washington
policy premised on Munich-type fears also ignores the fact that Mainland
China has reasonable expectations for its security. [As for the US
alliance structure]{.underline}, this book is advocating major changes
in that structure, in the hope that it would evolve toward something
lighter and more defensive. [Credibility is logically questioned when
commitments exceed genuine US national interests]{.underline}. [If US
commitments in the Asia-Pacific region are constrained to cover only the
clearest threats to US national security (thus excluding
Taiwan]{.underline}, in addition to various rocks and reefs along
China's maritime periphery), [those alliance relationships will actually
be strengthened]{.underline}. Thus[, it is well known that many South
Koreans, Japanese, and others in the region have been reasonably
concerned that their states, quite against their will, might be pulled
by treaty commitments into the vortex of a Taiwan scenario. Having
alleviated such alliance strains]{.underline}, chiefly caused by
unreasonable war-fighting requirements, [these alliances will actually
benefit]{.underline} from enhanced and increasingly stable
Taiwan--Mainland integration.

Deterrence After the Cold War." Columbia University Press.

**[WOULD JAPAN EVER DEVELOP ITS OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS?]{.underline}** The
short answer to this question is "**[not likely]{.underline}**," though
scholars disagree over the reasons.99 For years, [analysts have spoken
of a]{.underline} **["nuclear allergy"]{.underline}** [in
Japan]{.underline} resulting from World War II that prevented Japanese
leaders from discussing nuclear weapons, much less consider acquiring
them. Though constrained from discussing the issue publicly, Japan's
conservative leaders often discussed the issue privately, believing
Japan must keep the option open.100 Yet [for Japan to make the
decision]{.underline} to go nuclear [would require a]{.underline}
**[drastic deterioration]{.underline}** [of its security environment
accompanied by a]{.underline} **[collapse]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} Japan-U.S. [alliance]{.underline}. In many respects, a
Japanese decision to head in this direction is what Campbell and
Sunohara call "the ultimate contradiction." Japan's "standing as a
non-nuclear nation is a virtual bedrock of the nonproliferation regime"
yet "at the same time, suspicion and speculation have persisted that,
given the right set (really the wrong set) of international and domestic
conditions, Japan might seriously consider the nuclear option."101 Japan
clearly possesses the technology and infrastructure for a breakout
through its extensive civil nuclear energy program should it desire to
do so.102 Estimates of Japan's necessary breakout time range from a few
months to a year or two. The disaster that followed the March 2011
tsunami and nuclear catastrophe at Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant
raised the possibility that Japan might permanently shut down its
nuclear reactors and scrap its nuclear energy industry entirely,
removing its breakout capability. Yet in the end, Japan remains
committed to its nuclear energy program and in August 2015 restarted its
first nuclear power plant since shutting them all down in 2011. A few
months after the disaster, former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba
stated, "I don't think Japan needs to possess nuclear weapons, but it's
important to maintain our commercial reactors because it would allow us
to produce a nuclear warhead in a short amount of time. It's a tacit
nuclear deterrent."103 Maintaining a civilian nuclear program even after
the tragedy at Fukushima has a clear connection to maintaining some
level of nuclear breakout capability and nuclear deterrent. Referring to
the LDP's determination to maintain a nuclear energy program, Narushige
Michishita argued, "What they are saying in a tacit manner is that 98
percent of our program is peaceful, but we have the potential for
something else."104 [Japan would face]{.underline} some
[serious]{.underline} **[operational]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**political obstacles** should it seek nuclear weapons. Japan's people
are concentrated in]{.underline} several **[densely populated urban
areas]{.underline}** [that makes them]{.underline} **[very
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to a nuclear exchange. To have an effective
deterrent, Japan would need]{.underline} [many weapons, and given
Japan's lack of geographical depth, there are few places to]{.underline}
**[deploy]{.underline}** [these systems, **mak**ing them vulnerable to
a]{.underline} [**first strike**. Acquisition of the necessary weapons
systems, especially strategic bombers and ballistic missiles, would
violate the]{.underline} **[constitution]{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} **[EDOP]{.underline}**.105 Some disagree that nuclear
weapons are acceptable as a defensive system used only for retaliation,
and [there would]{.underline} likely [be a highly divisive]{.underline}
**[debate]{.underline}** in Japan should any government head in this
direction under any but the most dire circumstances. [Even in the wake
of]{.underline} what many would argue is [an increasingly aggressive
China]{.underline}, Prime Minister [Abe had a]{.underline} **[difficult
time]{.underline}** [obtaining **public support** for a constitutional
reinterpretation of collective **self-defense**. Finally, "going
nuclear" would also entail **leaving the NPT**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[damaging Tokyo's reputation]{.underline}** as a
nonproliferation stalwart. Economic **[sanctions]{.underline}** [would
likely follow, as well as restrictions on Japan's nuclear
industry]{.underline}.106 [For all these reasons, Japan would incur a
**heavy cost**]{.underline}, domestically and internationally, should it
move to acquire nuclear weapons. [Every time Japanese leaders have
examined this possibility, they have **acknowledged this reality** and
chosen instead to rely on the U.S. defense commitment.]{.underline} As
one study notes, "In the context of the gulf between Japanese public
opinion, which is largely ill-disposed toward nuclear weapons and
security hawks at the elite level eager to push back against this
'nuclear allergy,' the END \[extended nuclear deterrent\] offered and
continues to offer a neat and practical solution."107 [Thus, Japan will
continue to rely on the U.S. alliance and the nuclear umbrella while
also slowly increasing its]{.underline} own
**[conventional]{.underline}** [capabilities]{.underline} and leaving
the door open for nuclear acquisition. In the end, Samuels and Schoff
provide the most pointed analysis: "Although Japan's nuclear hedging
strategy is likely to continue in the near future, U.S. policy makers
(and those throughout the region) should not be sanguine about this
strategy continuing indefinitely. Japan's choices will be determined
ultimately by how well potential threats can be managed and by the
strength of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence."108

US Navy patrolling offshore, have allowed our allies to grow prosperous
without having to invest much in their own defense. Confident that the
United States protects them, our allies have even begun to squabble with
China over strings of uninhabited islands in the hope that there is oil
out there. It is time to give them a dose of fiscal and military
reality. And the way to do that is to stop standing between them and
their nuclear-armed neighbors. It will not be long before they realize

, May 24, 2019)

[Trump has only made this situation more precarious for Abe and his
compatriots. With its pacifist constitution and a military far smaller
than its status as the world's third-largest economy would imply, Japan
needs America's protection---and finds itself staring across the Pacific
at an erratic partner easily dismissive of longtime global commitments.
The fear that the U.S.-Japan alliance could be in jeopardy was one I
heard from numerous government officials and academics I met during a
weeklong visit to Japan earlier this year. And, they say, Abe will do
what he must to maintain it, whatever the cost to his personal
pride.]{.underline} "People in Japan understand that Mr. Trump is quite
unpredictable, and that we need to treat him in a different way," said
Murata. "They need the relationship for their own protection," adds
Jeffrey Prescott, a former Obama White House national security council
aide who served as senior Asia adviser to former Vice President Joe
Biden. "They're worried about being caught out in the cold." \*\*\* When
Abe visited the U.S. last year, Trump startled him with a blunt
historical reference: "I remember Pearl Harbor," Trump cracked,
reportedly launching into a complaint about Japan's economic policies.
However impolitic his remark may have been, Trump is right to think that
World War II continues to rule America's relationship with Japan. But a
more defining moment than the 1941 surprise attack on America's Pacific
fleet is what happened four years later in Hiroshima, when the U.S.
punctuated the final days of the war by dropping an atomic bomb on the
city, raising ground temperatures nearby to 5,000 degrees and instantly
killing up to 80,000 people. Today, the modest port city, also known for
baseball and its symphony orchestra, has become a living monument to the
horror of war, and also a place to contemplate the oddity of Japan's
continued dependency on the country that crushed it in anger nearly 75
years ago. Nine days after the blast, and after the U.S. dropped another
atomic bomb, this time on Nagasaki, Emperor Hirohito---whose grandson,
Naruhito, Trump will visit in Tokyo on Monday---announced his country's
unconditional surrender to America. Thus began a long and fraught
dependency that continues to this day. It was an incredible twist of
history when the conquered nation, emerging from a fascist nightmare,
actually welcomed its new occupiers after the war. "The Americans
arrived anticipating, many of them, a traumatic confrontation with
fanatical emperor worshippers. They were accosted instead by women who
called 'yoo hoo' to the first troops landing on the beaches in full
battle gear, and men who bowed and asked what their conquerors wished,"
writes John W. Dower in his Pulitzer Prize-wining history of postwar
Japan, Embracing Defeat. William Manchester's epic biography of Douglas
MacArthur recounts the moment one of the general's aides first stepped
off a plane in a freshly-defeated Japan, which MacArther was tasked with
running and rebuilding after the war: "Instantly, a mob of howling
Japanese headed for him. He was reaching for his weapon when they braked
to a halt, bowed, smiled, and offered him a cup of orangeade." Those
events occurred a few months before Trump was born, so he does not
actually "remember" any of them. But even though Japan has been remade
since, it remains conspicuously eager to please American leaders. In
large measure that is because Japan cannot properly defend itself. After
World War II, Japan was demilitarized to prevent a repeat of the fascist
militarism that led to its brutal conquest of much of East Asia. The
U.S. oversaw the adoption of a peace constitution prohibiting a standing
military---Japan technically maintains modest "self-defense
forces"---and declaring that its people "forever renounce war" and "the
threat or use of force as a means of settling disputes." And in the only
country to experience an atomic attack, nuclear weapons have been out of
the question. Conveniently, the U.S. was happy to station troops in the
country as a way of projecting power into the Asia-Pacific region, first
as a check against the Soviet Union and more recently against China.
America has also explicitly covered Japan with its "nuclear umbrella,"
shielding it from attack with the ultimate form of deterrence. For
several decades, the arrangement made sense for a Japan that faced few
credible military threats. But the 21st century has changed past
assumptions with startling speed. China's explosion of growth has led to
alarming new territorial claims; Tokyo's historic rival, which Japan
raped and pillaged in the 1930s and 1940s, now has a defense budget
about 10 times larger than Japan's. Meanwhile, North Korea, whose state
media has branded Abe an "Asian Hitler" has developed a large nuclear
arsenal and ever-more sophisticated missiles, which it sometimes fires
over Japan's territory. [Japan's relations with South Korea, an
important political and economic power, are also at what regional
experts call a 50-year low, poisoned by an ongoing dispute over what
Japan owes to forced laborers and so-called "comfort women" during its
wartime occupation of the Korean peninsula. J]{.underline}apan was
scandalized in February when a South Korean legislator referred to
Japan's then-emperor, since succeeded by Naruhito, as the son of a war
criminal. (One long-term nightmare here: a unified, hostile Korea.) Even
relations with Russia are tense, also thanks to the legacy of World War
II, in the form of a territorial dispute over remote islands most of the
world has never heard of; a Japanese legislator was recently expelled
from the country's Diet after suggesting (albeit drunkenly) that war
with Russia might be necessary to reclaim them. In sum, Japan looks
around and sees enemies and rivals that recall brutal Japanese
occupation, and too few close friends. That leaves it as dependent on
the U.S. as it has been in years. At the same time, it is as worried as
it's ever been about whether America can be relied upon. In the Trump
era, the U.S. has become inscrutable, unpredictable and potentially
unreliable. [People here are keenly aware of Trump's complaints about
the cost of American bases overseas and his questions about
long-standing alliances. "We're basically protecting Japan," Trump said
as a candidate. "If we're attacked, they do not have to come to our
defense. If they're attacked, we have to come totally to their defense.
And ... that's a real problem." Trump hasn't spoken that way in a while,
but Japanese officials have watched his continued skepticism about the
costs and mission of the NATO alliance, and ongoing complaints about the
expense of maintaining U.S. troops in South Korea, with great unease. In
meetings with diplomats and military strategists, most of whom would
only speak off the record, I was told repeatedly that a scaled back U.S.
presence in Asia, perhaps as a concession in a nuclear deal with North
Korea, would be a "disaster" or "nightmare." Never mind the 50,000
troops now stationed in Japan itself.]{.underline} Japan isn't totally
defenseless without its American military bodyguard. Thanks to China's
muscle-flexing, the passage of time and Abe's nationalistic leadership,
Japan in recent years has gradually been expanding its military's size
and legal capabilities. Trump officials, more than Obama ones before
them, have wholeheartedly embraced the shift, which Trump will
implicitly endorse this weekend when he visits a Japanese navy
helicopter carrier set for an upgrade that will allow it to carry
advanced American-made F-35B fighter jets. But [Japan also needs
American in other ways. Its diplomats have urged the U.S. to help
mediate its dispute with South Korea---though to little
avail]{.underline}. ("In somewhat more normal times," says Mike Green, a
former top Asia official in the George W. Bush White House now at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a big question around
Trump's trip would be, "What is the administration doing to patch up
ties between our two closest allies, whose fight is weakening our
position in Asia?") Meanwhile Japan's huge but deeply troubled economy,
which struggles with slow growth and an aging population, is highly
vulnerable to Trump's whims on tariffs. That's why it's a coup for Abe
and Japan that Trump, who does not love long trips, has made the 14-hour
flight to become the first foreign leader to meet the country's
newly-enthroned emperor. In recent public remarks, Trump has
demonstrated only a vague understanding of the honor, while boasting
that Abe has assured him it will be "100 times bigger" than the Super
Bowl. While there, Trump will award a specially-made trophy to the
winner of a national sumo wrestling championship, for which he will be
given a special chair in an area where even dignitaries typically sit on
the floor, cross-legged, reportedly to the annoyance of some of the
sport's diehards. In a signal of U.S. military support, Trump will also
deliver a speech at the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, in southern Japan.
Abe's flatter-Trump campaign is more than a personal whim, it is the
result of extensive analysis. "The Japanese have studied Trump as
thoroughly as any government, probably in the world, to try to
understand him, because the U.S.-Japan alliance is so critical," says
Green. But it has involved some cost at home. During my visit, the lead
headline in the Japan Times described a "grilling" the prime minister
had received in the Diet over Trump's public claim a few days earlier
that Abe had written "the most beautiful five-page letter" nominating
him to the Nobel Prize committee for his nuclear diplomacy with North
Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Abe couldn't quite bring himself to confirm
the notion, which seemed strange given that the talks had made little
real progress, and that Abe had been a past skeptic of talking to Kim.
"I'm not saying it's untrue," was all he would allow. According to the
Washington Post, Abe has more than once been referred to as "poochi" in
the country's left-leaning Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Many Japanese
officials argue, though, that Abe has made the best of an awkward
situation. Trump has stopped complaining about America's security
agreement with Tokyo and---unlike the case of South Korea---hasn't made
references lately to the cost of stationing troops and equipment in
Japan. Abe has helped explain to Trump how important American assets in
Japan are to containing China; U.S. Navy patrols into the contested
South China Sea often originate from the Japan's Yokosuka base. Although
Abe wasn't able to prevent Trump from slapping tariffs on Japanese steel
and aluminum exports, he has helped to delay potential U.S. tariffs on
automobiles that Japanese officials say would create a crisis in their
relationship with Washington. [Still, there is a sense of real disquiet
here about what may lie ahead. One Japanese official told me that Trump
is an effect, not a cause, of eroding American public support for
overseas alliances and adventurism. Moreover, some Japanese worry that
the character of the U.S. might be changing. Japan is coming to see
America "rather differently," said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese
ambassador to Washington who now chairs the America-Japan Society in
Tokyo. "The popularity of the U.S. is decreasing," he said, as Japanese
people see an erosion of "values, respect for international
institutions, and commitment to allies."]{.underline}

Mike **Mochizuki 17** holds the Japan-U.S. Relations Chair in Memory of
Gaston Sigur at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George
Washington University. He is co-editor of "Nuclear Debates in Asia: The
Role of Geopolitics and Domestic Processes.", 11/6/17, "Three reasons
why Japan will likely continue to reject nuclear weapons",
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/06/japan-is-likely-to-retain-its-non-nuclear-principles-heres-why/?utm_term=.7891237c8ec1

[Although Japan]{.underline} has long [had]{.underline} the technical
ability to develop nuclear weapons --- its "nuclear hedge" --- it has
refrained from doing so. [Japan]{.underline} instead [remains firmly
committed to its 1967 Three Non-Nuclear Principles of]{.underline}
**[not developing]{.underline}**, [**not possessing** and]{.underline}
**[not introducing nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**

This is not the first time that Japan has reexamined those principles.
Similar debates transpired after China's hydrogen bomb test in 1967, the
Soviet Union's deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles in Siberia
during the 1980s and North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006.

Is this time different? Reacting to North Korea's threatening behavior,
former Japanese defense minister Shigeru Ishiba stated in September that
Japan should at least debate the decision not to permit the introduction
of nuclear weapons on Japanese territory. Ishiba implied that Tokyo
should consider asking Washington to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in
Japan.

[This latest debate is likely to end in the same way as previous
debates]{.underline}, however. **[Japan will continue to adhere to its
Three Non-Nuclear Principles and forswear nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. [Here are three reasons for that:]{.underline}

[1) Staying non-nuclear is part of]{.underline} **[Japan's national
identity]{.underline}**

[The Three Non-Nuclear Principles are a]{.underline} clear [part of
Japan's **national identity**]{.underline}, [not simply a]{.underline}
**[policy preference]{.underline}**. [Repeated **polls
indicate**]{.underline} [overwhelming popular support for the three
principles]{.underline} in Japan. A 2014 Asahi newspaper poll revealed
that [support for the principles had risen to]{.underline} **[82
percent]{.underline}**, compared with 78 percent in a 1988 poll.
[Despite growing concerns about North Korea's nuclear program and
China's military power]{.underline} during this period, [Japanese
support for remaining non-nuclear **actually increased**.Even
after]{.underline} the provocative [North Korean **missile
launches**]{.underline} over Japan in August and September, [a Fuji News
Network poll showed that]{.underline} **[nearly 80
percent]{.underline}** [of the Japanese population remained opposed to
Japan becoming a nuclear weapons state]{.underline}. And nearly [69
percent opposed having the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [bring nuclear weapons into Japan.]{.underline}

[The legacy of]{.underline} the **[Hiroshima]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Nagasaki]{.underline}** atomic bombings [leave many
Japanese convinced]{.underline} that [their country has a]{.underline}
**[moral responsibility]{.underline}** [to promote]{.underline}
**[global nuclear disarmament]{.underline}** --- [as well as
to]{.underline} **[forgo nuclear weapons]{.underline}** of its own.
[The]{.underline} 2011 [Fukushima nuclear plant disaster]{.underline}
has **[reinforced]{.underline}** [this view.]{.underline}

In fact, increasing numbers of Japanese believe that the U.S. "nuclear
umbrella" is unnecessary for Japanese security. A June 2010 NHK survey
revealed that 20.8 percent felt that U.S. nuclear deterrence is
necessary for Japan's security in both the present and future, while
34.8 percent believed it unnecessary. The June 2015 NHK poll showed that
only 10.3 percent thought the U.S. nuclear umbrella is necessary for
both the present and the future --- 48.9 percent responded that it is
unnecessary now and later.

2\) [Powerful players in]{.underline} **[Japanese
politics]{.underline}** [can]{.underline} **[block nuclear
acquisition]{.underline}**

In addition to public opposition to nuclear weapons, [Japan has
significant]{.underline} **["veto players"]{.underline}** ---
[crucial]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}** [actors]{.underline} that are [likely to
block efforts to develop nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

Japan has a robust nuclear energy industry. But public acceptance of
nuclear energy in the 1950s resulted from a fundamental political
bargain: nuclear energy, but no nuclear weapons.

### 1AR No Korea Prolif

#### South Korea won't get nukes

Troy **Stangarone 16**, the Senior Director for Congressional Affairs
and Trade at the Korea Economic Institute of America, 2/29/16, "Going
Nuclear Wouldn't Be Easy for South Korea",
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/going-nuclear-wouldnt-be-easy-south-korea-15345?page=0%2C1

However, [South Koreans are rarely asked if they would be willing
to]{.underline} **[bear the costs]{.underline}** [of a]{.underline}
**[domestic nuclear weapon]{.underline}**. Those [cost would likely come
in the form of]{.underline} **[diminished international
standing]{.underline}**, **[economic hardship]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[uncertain strategic benefits.]{.underline}**

For South Korea to develop its own nuclear weapons program [it would
have to join]{.underline} **[North Korea]{.underline}** [as the only
country to withdraw from the]{.underline} Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (**[NPT]{.underline}**), an ignominious club for sure. Withdrawal
would dent Seoul's growing international standing and make it the only
member of MIKTA, an emerging club of middle powers, to have a nuclear
weapon, something which would not enhance South Korea's middle power
prestige.

While a loss of international stature to ensure domestic security might
be an acceptable trade off, [there would likely be]{.underline}
**[economic costs]{.underline}** as well. [Developing a]{.underline}
**[nuclear weapon]{.underline}** [would have consequences]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} **[South Korea's own nuclear industry]{.underline}**.
**[Nuclear power]{.underline}** [provides a third of South Korea's
electricity and represents 13 percent of its primary energy
consumption]{.underline}. [Lacking]{.underline} **[adequate domestic
reserves]{.underline}** [of nuclear fuel, South Korea is dependent upon
members of the **N**uclear **S**uppliers **G**roup which conditions
supply on the]{.underline} **[non-proliferation]{.underline}** [of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [Pursuing a nuclear option would put the
fuel supply for South Korea's domestic reactors at risk]{.underline} .

[South Korea]{.underline} [also has designs on becoming a major exporter
of nuclear power plants]{.underline}. In 2009, it won a \$40 billion
contract to construct and manage four nuclear power plants in the UAE
and in 2013 a bid for a research reactor in Jordan. Those [deals and any
future potential exports would be put risk.]{.underline}

[South Korea would also]{.underline} **[face potential economic
sanctions.]{.underline}** Iran and North Korea have both faced
significant financial and economic sanctions for their pursuit of
nuclear weapons, while India and Pakistan faced sanctions as well.
[Because South Korea is perhaps one of the world's most trade dependent
nations it would be **especially vulnerable** to external economic
pressure.]{.underline}

Given the clear and present danger that North Korea's nuclear program
presents to South Korea, it is hard to know what the consequences might
be if Seoul chose the nuclear option. Perhaps the international
community would look upon South Korea's choice with a greater degree of
understanding and acceptance than other nations, limiting any economic
consequences. However, there are no assurances that will be the case.

[From a]{.underline} **[strategic perspective]{.underline}** [the
decision to go nuclear could]{.underline} **[focus minds in
Beijing]{.underline}**, but [in ways that Seoul might not
want]{.underline}. [China has been vigorous in its objections to South
Korean consideration of deploying the THAAD missile defense
system]{.underline}. Beijing would likely object even more strenuously
to a South Korean nuclear weapons program, especially if it opened the
door to a Japanese nuclear weapon.

## Deterrence

### 2AC Deterrence

#### The neg's wrong about deterrence---US systems are expensive, outdated, and ill-equip for Taiwan---Taiwan's new self-defense initiative solves 

**Thompson 2018** (Drew Thompson was the Director for China, Taiwan, and
Mongolia in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 2011 to 2018. He
is now a Visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of
Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. "Hope On The
Horizon: Taiwan's Radical New Defense Concept",
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/10/hope-on-the-horizon-taiwans-radical-new-defense-concept/>
, OCTOBER 2, 2018)

[Taiwan is doomed. The numbers prove it. Or so we are told. Every year
the U.S. Department of Defense publishes the statistics. Taiwan's
defense budget is \$10 billion. China's is \$154 billion]{.underline}.
There are almost a million active duty soldiers in the People's
Liberation Army versus 140,000 ground troops across the strait. Taiwan
has 420 fighters versus China's 1,490 and 23 ships versus China's 240.
Taiwan has two modern attack submarines, while China has 52. [The
cross-strait military balance seems hopeless and the conventional wisdom
is that the threat of U.S. intervention in the event of an invasion is
the only thing deterring Beijing from reunifying the island by
force]{.underline}. [In the face of such overwhelming odds, however,
Taiwan's military has not given up. In fact, they've greatly improved
their chances for survival. Last year, Taiwan's Chief of the General
Staff, Adm. Lee Hsi-ming quietly proposed a revolutionary new approach
to Taiwan's defense, called the Overall Defense Concept. This new
concept, if effectively implemented, could turn the tables and give
Taiwan a fighting chance of preventing China from being able to take it
by force]{.underline}. China considers Taiwan a rogue province --- an
unresolved remnant of the civil war that otherwise ended in 1949 when
Chiang Kai-shek's defeated forces retreated to Taiwan under the
protection of the U.S. Navy. The U.S. military maintained a presence in
Taiwan until the normalization of diplomatic relations with China in
1979. China has stated its intent to reunify Taiwan by force if
necessary, and built up its military with the aim of both invading
Taiwan and preventing the U.S. military from coming to the island's
defense in time. Taiwan has historically been dependent on the United
States to deter China through both the threat of intervention and the
provision of arms. The Taiwan Relations Act requires the United States
to maintain the ability to defend Taiwan and provide it with "arms of a
defensive character." Taiwan's military has closely mirrored its U.S.
counterpart, in miniature, for years, sending its officers to U.S.
military school houses, training together, and acquiring both new and
used military platforms sold by the U.S. government. Taiwan's military
is now a hodgepodge of U.S and indigenously built systems. Its American
systems range from the cutting edge to the antique. Taiwan's AH-64E
Apache attack helicopter is newer than the model fielded by the U.S.
Army in the United States Indo-Pacific Command's area of responsibility.
Taiwan's F-16s are being retrofitted to include new capabilities that
U.S. Air Force pilots are jealous of. However, Vietnam-era systems like
M-60 tanks, Knox-class frigates, and F-5 fighters are also found in
Taiwan's arsenal. Each of Taiwan's services is in desperate need of
recapitalization and it is tempting to look at U.S.-made next-gen
frigates, M1A2 Abrams tanks, and F-35s as logical candidates. [The
problem with buying U.S. systems wholesale is that they are expensive,
designed to project power over great distances, and maximize mobility
and networks to take the fight to the enemy with overwhelming
superiority. Taiwan on the other hand, needs the opposite: systems that
are short-range and defensive, able to survive an initial bombardment
from a larger adversary, and suitable for deployment close to home in
defense of the island should it come under blockade or attack. Despite
mirror-imaging the U.S. military in its doctrine, training, and
capabilities for decades, Taiwan has begun to chart its own course.
Taiwan's new defense concept employs an asymmetric defense strategy,
where Taiwan maximizes its defense advantages, and targets an invading
force when it is at its weakest. Whereas Taiwan's previous strategy
focused on fighting across the entire Taiwan Strait and defeating the
enemy through attrition, the new concept divides Taiwan's defense
operations into two phases, both closer to Taiwan's shores where the
lines of communication are short and Taiwan's forces can benefit from
land-based air denial and more effective surveillance and
reconnaissance.]{.underline}

**Taiwan is a distinct issue -- China won't be adventurist**

**Goldstein 2015** (Lyle J Goldstein is visiting fellow of the Watson
Institute of International Studies at Brown University and an associate
professor in the China Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI), 7/7/15,

Georgetown University Press, MUSE,
<https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781626161627/9781626161627-6.pdf>)

Two plausible objections may be discussed briefly at this point, though
each is dealt with more comprehensively in chapter 12, the book's
conclusion. [A first objection concerns]{.underline} the oft-made
argument that any concession to [Beijing]{.underline} represents
"[appeasement"]{.underline} that will only invite greater aggression.
For those making this argument, Taiwan is the "ultimate prize" for
Beijing, and thus would raise China's confidence to unacceptably high
levels. A related argument concerning the fate of US alliances in the
Asia-Pacific region is made that any kind of reunification between the
Mainland and Taiwan would signal a "death blow" to the US-Japan
Alliance, and other allies would also be dubious of the US commitment to
the region's security. [However]{.underline}, both
[argument]{.underline}s [turn out to be specious]{.underline}---having
been [built on crude and simplistic assumptions.]{.underline} A clear
view of [history shows]{.underline} plainly that [Beijing approaches the
Taiwan issue quite differently than other issues, and so the expectation
that China, following unification, would immediately seek to apply its
hubris to other issues only stretches the imagination]{.underline}. The
"Munich" appeasement argument also seems to be ignorant of geography,
neglecting the fact that Taiwan's defense is not feasible over the long
term. White quite correctly concludes: "America can no longer defend
Taiwan from China, and a policy towards Taiwan that presumes that it can
is unsustainable."68 Even putting military capabilities aside, as Nathan
and Scobell relate, "Beijing is convinced that it enjoys an asymmetry of
motivation over the United States with respect to Taiwan."69

#### Sales don't add to deterrence or help Taiwan's self defense 

**Chung 2018** (Lawrence Chung covers major news in Taiwan, ranging from
presidential and parliament elections to killer earthquakes and

, 9/25/2018)

[Washington's plan to sell US\$330 million of spare parts for Taiwan's
warplanes will not change the cross-strait military situation or improve
the self-ruled island's ability to defend itself against growing threats
from Beijing, according to analysts.]{.underline} But they say that the
proposed deal is the latest sign of strengthening US-Taiwan ties and
shows that the administration of US President Donald Trump is willing to
take further steps to help ensure the island's security as Beijing
expands its military. The Pentagon's Defence Security Cooperation Agency
on Monday announced the planned sale of spare parts and logistics
support for F-16, C-130 and F-5 indigenous defence fighter jets, pending
final approval from the US Congress. It will be the second US weapons
deal under Trump, after his administration in June last year agreed to
sell a US\$1.4 billion arms package to Taiwan that included high-speed
anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes, missile components and technical
support for early warning radar. [Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade
province that should be reunited with the mainland, by force if
necessary. It has previously warned Washington against selling weapons
to Taiwan and establishing military relations with the island, and
remains locked in a trade war with the US.]{.underline} Taiwan was quick
to express its appreciation for the proposed deal, saying it showed
Washington's concern for the island's security. Presidential spokesman
Alex Huang said that the sale would "help boost Taiwan's confidence in
facing security challenges" from Beijing. He also said that Taiwan "will
continue to increase our investment in national defence, boost our
defence industry and technology development, and closely cooperate and
communicate with the US on various security issues and agendas".
[Analysts said that the new deal was unlikely to alter the military
imbalance between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since it involved
mainly aircraft parts and other logistics support. "Unlike fighter jets
like F-35s, this won't actually represent any significant increase in
Taiwan's defensive capabilities," said Arthur Ding, an associate
­research fellow at the Stockholm-based Institute for Security and
Development Policy, referring to a more advanced aircraft Taiwan has
sought from the US.]{.underline} "However, these spare parts and the
logistics support are necessary to keep the warplanes involved
operational," he said. Taiwan's former defence minister Andrew Yang said
that the spare parts should be one of continuing arms deals between
Taipei and Washington. "It should be part of the regular military
exchanges between the two sides," he said, adding that [the purpose of
the sale was not to boost Taiwan's defences.]{.underline}

### 1AR Deterrence

#### Taiwan's self-defense is key to deterrence---US systems fail but Overall Defense Concept solves 

**Thompson 2018** (Drew Thompson was the Director for China, Taiwan, and
Mongolia in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 2011 to 2018. He

<https://warontherocks.com/2018/10/hope-on-the-horizon-taiwans-radical-new-defense-concept/>
, OCTOBER 2, 2018)

[One challenge is that Taiwan's defense needs are diverging from the
expertise and systems the U.S. military can provide. For example, the
U.S. Marine Corps does not have a dedicated opposing force that Taiwan
could train with to hone their skills in defending beaches. Commanders
of Taiwan's squadrons of small fast attack boats can find no counterpart
in the U.S. Navy to train with. U.S. Navy mine warfare is
under-resourced, unappreciated and mines are considered a problem, not a
solution]{.underline}. Offensive mining may be making a comeback,
however, in light of the U.S. strategy identifying China as a key
threat. The U.S. Navy has recently signaled its developing interest in
mine warfare, publicly demonstrating the deployment of Quickstrike mines
from a B-52 in September during exercise Valiant Shield 18. With every
challenge comes opportunity. As the U.S. Army develops its multi-domain
battle concept and applies it to the Indo-Pacific, it will increasingly
realize that China is the challenge, and the battlespace is Taiwan. Adm.
Harry Harris, then commanding Pacific Command, spoke at the Association
of the U.S. Army conference in 2016, reduced the task to, "Army's got to
be able to sink ships." [U.S. Army could find solutions and
opportunities for expanding their reach into the maritime domain by
studying and innovating alongside their counterparts in
Taiwan]{.underline}. Conclusion [The beauty of Adm. Lee's Overall
Defense Concept is that it embraces an asymmetric strategy, does not
seek to compete with China's larger military head on, and focuses
Taiwan's resources on targeting the greatest threat, while surviving
long enough for third-party intervention]{.underline}. [It eschews
traditional symmetrical warfighting of surface action groups, fighter
planes, or tanks slugging it out head-to-head. Instead, it takes a page
from guerilla warfare and envisions large numbers of small, affordable,
highly mobile units taking advantage of the terrain to defeat a larger
enemy.]{.underline} U.S. defense experts should consider these concepts
as well as they contemplate how the U.S. military can address the threat
from increasingly capable adversaries. With its new Overall Defense
Concept, opportunities for collaboration with Taiwan to address
asymmetric challenges will increase. [Deterring China from seeking to
reunify Taiwan by force will continue to be a complex equation. The
threat of U.S. intervention remains the most critical factor, but as the
People's Liberation Army continues to modernize and expand, including
anti-access/area denial capabilities designed to challenge a U.S.
intervention, Taiwan's own defense capabilities become increasingly
important. The survivability of Taiwan's military, particularly its
combat effectiveness weeks after a conflict begins, and the ability to
slow and attrite an invading force is critical to buy time for the U.S.
to intervene.]{.underline} Adm. Lee has made a courageous proposal to
set Taiwan on that crucial course which will continue to assure
cross-strait stability despite the threat from an increasingly capable
adversary.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should halt the sale
of]{.underline} new types of [weapons]{.underline} systems. This
concession is not recommended lightly, but Steinberg and O'Hanlon seem
to call for similar adjustments in US policy in exchange for a reduced
Mainland military posture targeting Taiwan.56 As true as it may be that
Taiwan has had the confidence to enter into negotiations because of its
military relationship with the United States, it is just as certain, if
not more so, that [Taiwan may continue to resist serious negotiations
regarding its political status vis-à-vis the Mainland as long as defense
ties to the United States remain robust]{.underline}. [The notion that
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can indefinitely maintain
such a close security relationship with a claimed island off the coast
of a nuclear-armed, rising superpower is simply absurd and defies all
the "natural laws" of international relations]{.underline}. Seeking for
a point of comparison, one might think of the position of Berlin during
the Cold War, and yet the USSR did not claim Berlin as its own "sacred
territory." [Imagine]{.underline}, instead, [if the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [had sought to hold Crimea]{.underline} or some
such territory [against Moscow's will. Such a position would have been
strategically untenable and risky in the extreme]{.underline}. Even in
present circumstances, Washington has refused to take any military steps
to counter Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. [Military analysts
knowledgeable about the cross-Strait "balance" fully recognize that
there is no balance at all. China's military modernization has steadily
outstripped Taiwan's armed forces]{.underline}, to the point where
[Taiwan's armed forces are now outclassed in practically every
domain]{.underline} of warfare. With ballistic and cruise missile
saturation, Beijing, if it so chooses, can effectively eviscerate
Taiwan's air force (and navy), claim air superiority, and then
successfully conduct amphibious operations. Thus, [arms sales have for
some time taken on a purely symbolic meaning. This is well understood on
Taiwan]{.underline}---hence, 66 Meeting China Halfway the reluctance to
spend large sums on big-ticket weapons systems. In effect, the Obama
administration has recognized the necessity to limit arms sales to
Taiwan by agreeing to upgrade existing aircraft, rather than selling
F-16C/D aircraft. Indeed, this policy is actually consistent with the
1982 US commitment not to sell Taiwan advanced military hardware.
Regarding that particular agreement, Nathan and Scobell suggest that
Washington has been duplicitous in the past: "Once the agreement was in
place, the Americans proceeded to use legalistic reasoning to empty it
of all meaning."57 It is worth stating, moreover, that Taiwan may well
seek military hardware from other states, such as those in Europe or
even Russia. But the value to global security of stability in USChina
relations has long outweighed any marginal gain that Taipei gains in
negotiations from these weapons sales. China should restrict the
building of its amphibious fleet. Having secured major new commitments
by Washington to restrict arms sales and to help facilitate an accord
regarding Taiwan's final status, Beijing must respond with concrete and
measurable new limits on its own ability to strike at Taiwan. Although
somewhat improbable, amphibious invasion still ranks near the top of
Taipei's fears regarding the Mainland, especially as the Chinese Navy
makes continual forward strides. More than Beijing's initial testing of
an aircraft carrier in 2012, the Type 071 amphibious assault ship, which
carries one marine battalion plus fifteen to twenty armored vehicles, is
a platform that especially concerns Taiwan. The vessel is nearly on par
with Western equivalents, and has the special capability to launch
high-speed large hovercraft, which amounts to a rapid, over-the-horizon
strike capability with the potential to overturn traditional
calculations regarding the feasibility of an amphibious attack across
the Strait.58 As of 2014, three Type 071s had been launched, but another
may be under construction.59 In addition, all signs point to an air
assault complimentary capability, known as the Type 081, that will be
capable of deploying dozens of large helicopters---also quite ideal for
a modern amphibious assault. Moreover, a 2014 exercise sought to
demonstrate that new Chinese Z-10 attack helicopters, which had
previously only been associated with the ground forces, could be
operated from Chinese naval vessels of various types.60 Such innovative
capabilities, deployed on a large scale, could gravely threaten Taiwan.
Although missile and aerial bombardments, of course, are massively
threatening to Taiwan, the threat of amphibious assault nevertheless
causes the most anxiety naturally, as it holds out the possibility of an
all-out and appallingly bloody campaign to completely subjugate Taiwan.
If China builds a dozen large amphibious attack vessels (either 071s or
081s), it will have the premier amphibious attack capability in the
world, especially as state-of-the-art attack helicopters are added into
the mix in extensive numbers. Anything above that number of amphibious
attack vessels (in combination with other assets, including
low-technology transports) would give China the ability to invade Taiwan
outright. Undoubtedly, these multimission platforms can provide China
with important new capabilities for exerting global power---including
giving humanitarian relief, evacuating Chinese nationals from a conflict
situation, and even pursuing open ocean antisubmarine warfare.
Nevertheless, a dozen of these large, amphibious attack vessels should
be more than adequate for implementing China's newly ambitious foreign
and defense policies. An explicit commitment to cap the PLA Navy's
amphibious capabilities would offer Taiwan (and other neighboring island
states) the additional assurance that Beijing has no need for colossal
capabilities for an amphibious attack. Such military restraint would
play an important role in a China-US cooperation spiral for Taiwan.The
United States should cease all arms transfers to Taiwan[. In halting
arms shipments to Taipei, Washington can make a clean break with its
involvement in the Chinese civil war]{.underline}. This involvement
originally was an accident of history, when the United States found
itself after World War II presiding over the entire Asia-Pacific region,
and Washington, to its credit, tried hard to reconcile the Communists
and Nationalists in the late 1940s for the greater good of the Chinese
people. Whether or not this was warranted, or whether the Chinese people
had to find their own way, is debatable, of course. But the record
clearly shows that the United States intended to leave the island to
communist rule, except when the Korean War briefly led Washington's
decision makers to believe that a titanic World War III was in the
immediate offing. Thankfully, it was not, but Taiwan by happenstance
rather than by strategic design thereafter became an American
protectorate. Most likely, the Taiwanese people and even the Mainland
have to some extent benefited from this accident of history, but it is
time to end this unnatural protectorate status, which would otherwise
only intensify for the worse and fester like an infected wound under
current global power trends. It is a wonder that such a situation
persisted for so long---a condition that can only be explained by
China's perennial weakness. [The adjustment is not only an imperative
for US foreign policy, but also for global security that demands
effective US-China cooperation in the security domain, and all others as
well.]{.underline} Gilley is quite correct in asserting that "Taipei's
decision to chart a new course \[in 2008\] is a godsend for \[the\] . .
. United States. . . . The overburdened giant should happily watch \[the
cross-Strait rapprochement\] and focus on other pressing regional and
global issues."61 Also, according to Michael Swaine, "It is . . .
extremely unlikely that Washington will significantly alter its balanced
policy . . . \[on\] the Taiwan issue."62 But he also concludes that
"Washington . . . should consider negotiating directly with Beijing, in
consultation with Taipei, a set of mutual assurances regarding PLA force
levels and deployments on the one hand, and major US arms sales and
defense assistance on the other hand that are linked to the opening of a
cross-Strait political dialogue." That is precisely the process that is
being advocated here. [The arms sales cutoff will not significantly
alter the military balance,]{.underline} [which,]{.underline} as has
been discussed above, [is now largely symbolic. However, it will
obviously alter the political calculus, focusing the minds of
cross-Strait negotiators to press forward toward an
agreement.]{.underline} Contrary to the dire predictions of American
conservatives, [such a policy would not destabilize the Strait, because
the military options would remain arduous]{.underline} and incredibly
destructive. Thus, [both Taiwan and the Mainland could be expected to
remain on the negotiating track.]{.underline}

## Add-On

### 2AC China Relations

**Chinese backlash over arms sales is growing and will determine the
future of US/China relations -- reversing US policy is key to prevent
conflict and spills over to other areas**

Charles **Glaser**, Professor of Political Science and International
Affairs, George Washington University, Spring **15**, International

A common counterpoint to the argument above is that China-Taiwan
relations have improved dramatically since 2008, so the probability of
war is low.66 This, in turn, means the expected benefits offered by
policies that would keep the United States out of a China-Taiwan
conflict have decreased. Although this argument has merit, [it is hard
to be confident that cross-strait relations will remain good. Taiwan
might again elect a more pro-independence government, or China might
ramp up pressures for unification]{.underline}. Jia Qingguo, a professor
at Peking University, recently wrote: "\[P\]olitical [pressures on the
Chinese government when it comes to Taiwan are tremendous and
growing]{.underline}. [In the past, the Chinese people knew that China
was weak and could not stop the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[from selling weapons to Taiwan. Now, many believe that China should no
longer tolerate such insulting behavior. Confronted with this mounting
domestic pressure, the CCP]{.underline} \[Chinese Communist Party\] [is
finding it increasingly difficult to justify its weak
responses]{.underline}."67 More important, however, is that focusing on
the quality of current cross-strait relations overlooks two other less
direct, but potentially more signiªcant, beneªts of U.S. accommodation
on Taiwan. First, U.S. support for Taiwan is one of the most important,
possibly the most important, policy-driven sources of China's suspicions
about U.S. motives and intentions. Although the United States does not
take a position on what the ªnal outcome of the Taiwan issue should be,
China considers U.S. support of Taiwan a key source of "strategic
distrust." [A recent study by two leading authorities on U.S.-China
relations concludes that Beijing views U.S. arms sales to Taiwan "as
confirming American]{.underline} arrogance and [determination to
interfere in China's domestic affairs]{.underline} and to prevent
peaceful uniªcation from occurring, thereby [harming a]{.underline}
clearly-articulated [Chinese core interest]{.underline}." In a similar
vein, their report argues that "continuing to provide Taiwan with
advanced weapons . . . is viewed as pernicious in Chinese eyes and has
added to suspicion that Washington will disregard Chinese interests and
sentiments as long as China's power position is secondary to
America's."68 Nathan and Scobell conclude that "most Chinese see
strategic motives at the root of American behavior. They believe that
keeping the Taiwan problem going helps the U.S. tie China down."69
Similarly, a prominent Chinese analyst argues: "[The
position]{.underline} the U.S. takes [on]{.underline} the
[Taiwan]{.underline} issue [determines]{.underline} the essence of
American strategy toward China, and thus determines the quality and
status of [U.S.-China relations]{.underline}."70 Xu Hui, a professor at
China's National Defense University, holds that "[U.S. policies toward
Taiwan]{.underline} have been and [are the fundamental cause
of]{.underline} some [anti-American sentiment among the Chinese
public]{.underline}\....I assure you that [a posture change]{.underline}
of the U.S. policy [on Taiwan will remove the major obstacle
for]{.underline} our military-to-military [relations]{.underline} and
also strengthen Sino-American cooperation by winning the hearts and
minds of 1.3 billion Chinese people."71 In short, ending the U.S.
commitment to Taiwan has the potential to dramatically improve
U.S.-China relations, which in turn could [increase]{.underline} the
possibility of [cooperation on other issues and reduce the probability
of]{.underline} competition and [conflict]{.underline}.

**That's key to solve every global impact**

**Cohen 2009 - former U.S. secretary of defense** \[Maurice R. Greenberg
is chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr & Co., Inc. "Smart Power in U.S.-China
Relations," pg online @

[The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next]{.underline} months,
[years]{.underline}, and decades [has the potential to have a greater
impact on global security]{.underline} and prosperity than any other
bilateral or multilateral arrangement. [In this sense, many analysts
consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most
influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S.
alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of
U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the
trajectory of U.S.-China relations will determine the success, or
failure, of efforts to address the toughest global challenges: global
financial stability, energy security and climate change,
nonproliferation, and terrorism, among other pressing
issues.]{.underline} Shepherding that trajectory in the most
constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for
Washington and Beijing. [Virtually no major global challenge can be met
without U.S.-China cooperation]{.underline}. The uncertainty of that
future trajectory and the \"strategic mistrust\" between leaders in
Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns '\'many experts and
policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as
a strategic competitor---deliberately vying with the United States for
energy resources, military superiority, and international political
influence alike--- analysis by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its
soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda
primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and
social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington,
not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United
States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft
power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions
to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have
atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a
competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be
mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global
problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the
respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices
that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and
overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic
contexts. Both parties must recognize---and accept---that the other will
pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest.
Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational,
and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread
of SARS from China in 2003, [pandemic flu can be spread rapidly through
air]{.underline} and via international travel. Dust particulates from
Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and
does trigger an economic slowdown in another. [These challenges can no
longer be addressed by]{.underline} either [containment]{.underline} or
isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily
encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did
in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote
its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS
Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the
\"global good.\"3 This approach is not always practical or achievable,
of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic
pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United
States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and
political influence in key countries and regions around the world in
ways that enable the United States to better confront global and
transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those
things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not
been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite
historical, cultural, and political differences between the United
States and China, Beijing\'s newfound ability, owing to its recent
economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for
common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing
recognition that [no major global challenge can be addressed
effectively, much less resolved, without the active engagement of---and
cooperation between---the United States and China]{.underline}. [The
United States and China---the worlds first- and third-largest
economies---are inextricably linked,]{.underline} a fact made ever more
evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand
in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of
global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and
threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries.
Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more
clear than in international finance. China has \$2 trillion worth of
largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the
world\'s largest holder---by far---of U.S. government debt. Former
treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the
structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current
economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to
purchase the lion\'s share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in
connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton\'s February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing
that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese
investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries,
and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared
interest---and central role---that both countries have in turning around
the global economy quickly. Although China\'s considerable holdings of
U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being
perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the
worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United
States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient
economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate
global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been
elusive, owing as much to Washington\'s reluctance as to Beijing\'s
intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse
for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part,
China, as the world\'s top polluter, must cease playing the
developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain
an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China
cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the
energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy
means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto
global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors
such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an
area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in
emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities.
Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in
international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military
contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide
economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize
instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel
antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support
of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism
offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation.
Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the
Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council
require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more
broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic
interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more
Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation
and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the
number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this
regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law
enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western
China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of
narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the
International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint
antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint
capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the
issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage
NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the
auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an
additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian
security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes
Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on
Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in
Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and
the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on
interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure,
there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and
Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has
disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly
dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have
challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of
addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in
quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China
context, there is often little to be gained---and much to be lost in
terms of trust and respect---by a polarizing debate. Any differences,
moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both
sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that
\"the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two
opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability
to function.\"3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and
vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence.
Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will
help promote strategic trust between China and the United States,
facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited
cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms
for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In
fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent
years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental
bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3
reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding
workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama
administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by
Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary
Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief
that \'We must use\... the full range of tools at our
disposal---diplomatic, economic, military, political and
cultural---picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each
situation.\"\' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November
2007, \"Smart Power is neither hard nor soft---it is the skillful
combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a
strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and
institutions at all levels\... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily
mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues.
\'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people
and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the
world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will
or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and
Chinese people should expect their leaders [to come together on those
vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership,
though not inevitable, is indispensable]{.underline}.

### \--1AR Turns Deterrence 

**Strong US/China relations enhance US deterrence and military presence
in the rest of the Asia Pacific**

Charles **Glaser**, Professor of Political Science and International
Affairs, George Washington University, March/April **11**, Will China\'s
Rise Lead to War?, Foreign Affairs,

[Confidence in the U.S. deterrent is likely to be reinforced
by]{.underline} relatively [good relations between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China]{.underline}. Those
who feared that the United States could not extend its deterrent to
Western Europe believed that the Soviet Union was a highly revisionist
state bent on radically overturning the status quo and willing to run
enormous risks in the process. There is virtually no evidence suggesting
that China has such ambitious goals, so extending the U.S. deterrent
should be easier now than during the Cold War. And even in the unlikely
event that China evolved into such a dangerous state, deterrence would
still be possible, albeit more difficult. Some realist pessimists argue
that in order to be highly secure, China will find itself compelled to
pursue regional hegemony, fueling conflict along the way. However,
[China\'s size, power, location, and nuclear arsenal will make it very
challenging to attack successfully. China will not need to push the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [out of its region in order to
be secure, because a forward U.S. presence will not undermine
China\'s]{.underline} core [deterrent capabilities]{.underline}. A major
U.S. withdrawal, moreover, would not automatically yield Chinese
regional hegemony, because Japan and South Korea might then acquire
stronger conventional military capabilities and nuclear capabilities of
their own, greatly reducing China\'s coercive potential. A Chinese drive
for regional hegemony, therefore, would be both unnecessary and
infeasible. The United States\' forward military presence does enhance
its power-projection capabilities, which threaten China\'s ability to
protect its sea-lanes and coerce Taiwan. But the U.S. alliance with
Japan also benefits China by enabling Japan to spend far less on
defense. Although the United States\' power far exceeds Japan\'s, China
has seen the alliance as adding to regional stability, because it fears
Japan more than the United States. As China grows more powerful, it may
increasingly resent U.S. influence in Northeast Asia. But [unless
U.S.-Chinese relations become severely strained, China is likely to
accept a continuing U.S. presence]{.underline} in the region, [given the
alternatives]{.underline}.

Indeed, [U.S. policy to Taiwan has become less predictable since
President Trump came to office. Many uncertainties, such as the power
struggle inside Trump's policy-making circle between the nationalists
and internationalists and the policy debates between the hardline and
moderate Republicans, have resulted in the unpredictability of Trump's
policy to Beijing as well as Taipei.]{.underline} However, against the
backdrop of the ongoing wide-range U.S. debates over Washington's China
policy in academic and policy circles over the policy of engagement and
hedging, one cannot help but link the decisions on Taiwan with U.S.
intentions to balance against a rising China. In other words, [the
Taiwan card will continue to be played by the Trump
administration]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [it is not unlikely that
President Trump may want to **"make a deal" with Beijing over Taiwan in
exchange of economic gains**]{.underline} as well as the Korean
Peninsula issue about which he is more concerned. As Raymond Burghardt
indicated, **[the U.S. Taiwan policy might be negotiable with Beijing

Trump's earlier challenge to and later acceptance of the one-China
policy have demonstrated that the president's ignorance of foreign
affairs can be improved only through a belated learning process
depending on individual channels rather than institutional
decision-making processes. [When considering all decisions by the U.S.
government and Congress concerning Taiwan after Trump's inauguration,
one can feel that the strategic importance of Taiwan is
reemphasized]{.underline}. [Since the beginning of 2017, for instance,
Washington has increased its security cooperation with the
island]{.underline}, particularly in a nontraditional sphere like
antiterrorism. Besides, [the arms sale of a \$1.42 billion arms
package---including seven proposed defense sales---to Taiwan on 29 June
2017 is the first such sale under the Trump administration.]{.underline}
This package includes advanced missiles and torpedoes as well as
technical support for an early warning radar system, which has surely
overshadowed the Xi-Trump summit in April of that year and threatened to
undermine PRC-U.S. relations. In addition, the U.S. Congress has pushed
for new resolutions to upgrade Washington-Taipei relations, enhance the
security of Taiwan, and bolster Taiwan's participation in international
organizations such as the WHA, Interpol, and the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO). Some proposals may lead to a port call of
the U.S. Navy to Taiwan and sending uniformed marines to the AIT in
Taiwan. [Another decision that would exert an extremely serious impact
on the cornerstone of U.S.-China relations is the passage of the Taiwan
Travel Act (TTA), which was passed without amendment by unanimous
consent in the U.S. Senate on 28 February 2018, expressing "the sense of
Congress that the U.S. government should encourage visits between U.S.
and Taiwanese officials at all levels."65 President Trump's signature of
the TTA indicates a breakthrough in Washington's and Taipei's unofficial
relationship at the price of U.S.-China ties. This is followed by
Washington's reluctance to allow American airlines to redefine Taiwan as
a non-state---under Beijing's pressure---on their
websites.66]{.underline}

ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN",
<https://www.nbr.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/us-taiwan_defense_relations_roundtable_may2018.pdf>
, May 2018)

[The overall direction of the Trump administration's Taiwan policy is to
ensure that democratic Taiwan remains a confident contributor in a tense
and turbulent world. This means ensuring that Taiwan does not have to
succumb to coercion and threats of force and that it is integrated
rather than isolated from global affairs. These goals will be achieved
through direct relations with Taiwan, but first and foremost through
strong and clear signals sent to China]{.underline}. Under the Obama
administration, China was seen as a lender, a trading partner, a
diplomatic collaborator, and a potential military challenger. [The Trump
administration]{.underline}, however, appreciates the complexity of the
bilateral relationship but [views China as a long-term strategic
competitor]{.underline}. This realistic view assimilates the argument of
scholars such as Michael Pillsbury, who asserts "that Beijing seeks to
remake the global hierarchy, with itself as leader, and to counter and
undermine the power and influence of the United States."6 Once seen as
unduly hawkish, this argument has become more mainstream and
bipartisan.7 It is too early to discern the full weight and impact of
this China policy, but the United States' Taiwan policy is now
inextricably linked to a more realistic evaluation of Sino-U.S.
relations. Chinese threats to block all U.S. arms sales to Taiwan appear
empty in 2018. But unless the United States stands up to those threats
with political will, strength, and resources, it is only a matter of
time before China attempts to test a shifting balance of power.
Fortunately, the United States is not a disinterested power, but instead
has every intention to thwart that coercive design in order to preserve
peace across the Taiwan Strait and protect the people of Taiwan from
Chinese threats and pressure. Reflecting the determination of the Trump
administration to support democratic Taiwan, the new National Security
Strategy embraces Taiwan by name, albeit within the context of
long-standing policy: "We will maintain our strong ties with Taiwan in
accordance with our 'One China' policy, including our commitments under
the Taiwan Relations Act to provide for Taiwan's legitimate defense
needs and deter coercion."8 [In pledging to push back against a more
assertive and capable China, the Trump administration follows its
predecessors by viewing the Taiwan Relations Act as a vital legal
framework, requiring the executive branch not to neglect Taiwan's
legitimate needs to remain free from threats and isolation. Regularized
arms sales designed to maintain a military balance across the Taiwan
Strait are consistent with that act. In this sense the administration's
Taiwan policy might be viewed as a front-line challenge for its stated
goal of preserving and building a free and open Indo-Pacific
strategy.]{.underline} The military dimension of maintaining a favorable
balance of power and a free and open Indo-Pacific laid out in the new
U.S. National Defense Strategy is relevant to Taiwan: "A more lethal,
resilient, and rapidly innovating Joint Force, combined with a robust
constellation of allies and partners, will sustain American influence
and ensure favorable balances of power that safeguard the free and open
international order."9 Taiwan, while not mentioned by name, is a key
component of that constellation of allies. [The Trump administration is
willing to threaten China with strong-arm tactics while preparing for
long-term competition.]{.underline} For instance, it is continuing to
exhort Beijing to help pressure North Korea into adopting a path toward
denuclearization, even if that means imposing secondary sanctions on
Chinese banks and other entities doing business with Pyongyang. The
administration is also shifting defense priorities to focus on
developing long-term, high-end capabilities and a national innovation
base in critical technology areas such as artificial intelligence,
quantum computing, and autonomous machines. Regarding the growing trade
deficit with China, the Trump administration is continuing to threaten
tariffs and other protectionist measures, along with new restrictions on
investments that impinge on national security industries or
technologies. But as in the security arena, the administration is also
continuing to look for areas of cooperation, and President Trump puts
high stock in his personal relations with Xi.

### AT: Try or Die

#### Reject the affirmative's try or die claims based on hyperbolic authors---it's an illogical way to make decisions that ignores huge risks

\*Italics in original

[The clouds over Taiwan have grown darker]{.underline} in recent months.
In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Taiwan must be unified
with the mainland and urged Taipei to embrace the 1992 Consensus. It
states that there is only "one China" and Taiwan belongs to it but
allows different interpretations of which is the governing entity. China
"will not rule out the use of force" against foreign intervention, Xi
said. Tsai reiterated that her government will never accept the "one
country, two systems" model and defended the democratic island's
sovereignty. The worrisome China-Taiwan tensions come as the U.S.-China
relationship has deteriorated, with the two rivals engaged in major
disputes over trade and technology and jostling for power in the western
Pacific. During this week's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
meetings in Washington, threats from China reportedly featured more
prominently than ever before. [Experts say all of these factors are
increasing the risk of a cross-strait crisis. **"The *status quo* is
admittedly imperfect," wrote CFR President Richard N. Haass, "but it is
far less imperfect than what would follow unilateral actions and
attempts to resolve a situation that doesn't lend itself to a neat
solution."**]{.underline}

### Neg Offense First 

#### Prefer our offense over solvency---the plan can't solve friction with China but threatens Taiwan and causes other US-PRC friction 

**Schell and Shirk 2019** (Orville Schell-Asia Society, Susan
Shirk-University of California San Diego. "Course Correction: Toward An
Effective And Sustainable China Policy",

, Feb. 2019)

The long-standing United States policy of insisting on peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue remains a vital American interest. This
policy serves to protect the principle of peaceful resolution of
disputes in the international system, and to preserve a vibrant Asian
democracy. Peaceful resolution will require the agreement of Beijing and
the assent of the residents of Taiwan, expressed through their
democratic processes. Pending such resolution, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must stand ready to deter unprovoked military
aggression by Beijing against Taiwan. Washington must maintain a strong
and credible military presence in the Western Pacific to convince
Beijing that the United States still has serious military options,
despite the improvements described above in Chinese military
capabilities]{.underline}. At the same time, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should assist Taiwan in developing asymmetric
capabilities to hold off the massively superior mainland military until
the United States can bring forces to bear.]{.underline} Robust shore
batteries, improved air defenses, mobile response units, and sea mines
to counter landing craft can all pose major problems for an invading
People's Liberation Army (PLA) force. PLA blockades pose arguably the
most difficult challenge to Taiwan and the United States, a reminder
that the United States should encourage Taiwan to develop deeper
strategic reserves of key materials and to create better logistic
linkages between smaller ports and population centers. To avoid
exacerbating cross-Strait tensions or potentially even triggering a
mainland attack, Washington should not alter its "one China policy,"
which was established by the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué and reinforced in
subsequent U.S.-China communiqués, and which has served well the cause
of strategic stability in the Taiwan Strait. While not challenging the
claim that there is one China and that Taiwan is part of China, this
policy does not take a position in favor of unification, and seeks to
maintain stability in the Strait by insisting on peaceful resolution of
the Taiwan issue. **[Taking symbolic or substantive actions that call
into question the U.S. commitment to its historic policy will aggravate
the mainland threat to Taiwan and cause unproductive friction in
Washington-Beijing relations without accomplishing any useful
purpose.]{.underline}** Clarity and continuity in U.S. policy will be
particularly important during Taiwan's 2020 presidential election
campaign, which could increase cross-Strait tensions. While adhering to
its "one China policy," the United States should provide stronger
support for Taiwan by expressing its concern about China's increased
diplomatic, economic, and military pressure on Taiwan; calling for a
resumption of dialogue across the Strait; permitting appropriate
high-level official visits between the United States and Taiwan;
exploring further trade and investment liberalization with Taiwan; and
continuing to push for increased participation for Taiwan in
international organizations and activities for which statehood is not a
requirement.

## Cross-Strait

### 1NC No Taiwan War

#### No Taiwan war---it's less likely than other hotspots and both sides will deescalate 

**You and Hao 2018** (Hao Ji You is Professor and head of the Department
of Government, University of Macau. Yufan Hao is Dean of the Faculty of

(August 2018), 89--119)

[In comparison with other Asian hot spots, there are certainly
restraints for Washington to play the Taiwan card when the benefits can
turn into costs.]{.underline} [It can decide whether to involve itself
militarily and how much in a face-off in the SCS, as it is unlikely
there will be a major war there]{.underline}. In the Strait, the
declared independence would trigger the mainland's attack and lock the
United States into a reluctant war with another nuclear power. [Unless
Sino-U.S. contention triggers a direct confrontation, Washington would
continue to rein in Taipei in the foreseeable future, as shown by Bush's
rebuke on Chen Shui-bian.76 This serious calculus of Washington on
military intervention in the Taiwan conflicts is conducted from the
political and strategic height, which serves to prove this article's
central argument of politics in command of military options by the three
parties in the triangular inaction.]{.underline}

### 1NC Europe Alt Cause

#### The aff can't solve PRC concerns over arms sales---Europe makes them inevitable

However, [Beijing does not just have the US to worry about]{.underline}.
[Taiwanese media reported on September 26 about two contracts with
France on training and upgrades to nearly 50 French-made Mirage 2000
high-altitude fighter jets in Taiwan's air force inventory.]{.underline}
Moreover, [Taiwan's defence ministry decided on a European design for
Taiwan's Indigenous Defence Submarine project]{.underline}. The media
has speculated that French shipbuilder Direction des Constructions
Navales Services and German Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft were among the
contenders, and one of them is likely to be the winner. [The French
connection to Taiwan's defence modernisation is a timely reminder that
European defence industry companies are present and active in Taiwan.
With France and Germany leading European resistance against adverse
effects of the Belt and Road Initiative, and greater scrutiny over
Chinese investment in and acquisition of strategic industries, Europe's
arms suppliers may find the situation ripe for taking a greater share in
Taiwan's defence projects. Their governments may very well give them the
green light.]{.underline}

### AT: Modernization I/L

**Ending arms sales to Taiwan doesn't solve Chinese military
modernization**

**Rigger 2011** (Shelley, Brown Professor and chair of political science
at Davidson College, 11/29, \"Why giving up Taiwan will not help us with
China,\"
https://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/)

[Gilley, Glaser, Freeman, and Owens believe arms sales are the driver
for China's military buildup opposite Taiwan]{.underline}. **[But that
buildup has continued uninterrupted through periods of arms sales and
periods when arms sales were suspended]{.underline}**; [it continued
under Sinophobic Taiwanese presidents and is continuing now under the
most proengagement president Taiwan has ever seen. The evidence suggests
China's military posture has its own logic]{.underline}, which in turn
suggests that **[a change in US policy would do little to alter
it]{.underline}**. Foreign Affairs published several letters criticizing
the Gilley and Glaser articles, especially the two authors' sanguine
view of China's military deployments. Both authors published rejoinders
to their critics in which they made critical concessions. In Gilley's
words, "If China were to reduce its threat to Taiwan by promising
verifiable and immediate force reductions, as well as by allowing Taipei
to continually expand its role in international organizations, Taiwan
may decide that participating in U.S. military planning, purchasing
major weapons systems from the United States, and denying offshore naval
security to China are no longer worth it. However, [an implicit U.S.
promise to intervene in the event of any invasion of Taiwan would be
necessary in order for Taipei to choose to change course"]{.underline}
(emphasis added).\[19\] [Glaser made a similar concession]{.underline},
writing, "The United States could stop selling arms to Taiwan but
maintain its pledge to defend Taiwan should China launch an unprovoked
attack; it could continue to sell Taiwan arms but make clear that it
will not intervene on Taiwan's behalf should a conflict occur, even if
Taiwan did not provoke it; or it could link its continued support to the
Taiwanese government's willingness to refrain from moving toward
independence."\[20\] [Both authors, in other words, admitted that some
kind of US security guarantee was necessary for Taiwan: in exchange for
ending arms sales, the United States would need to make an implicit (or
explicit) "promise to intervene]{.underline}." Three serious problems
with this line of argument exist. First, **[in the absence of arms
sales, a promise to intervene might not be credible]{.underline}**.
Could the United States mount a successful defense of Taiwan if the
island had been disarmed? Second, [such a policy invites envelope
pushing on both sides of the strait.]{.underline} America's decades-old
policy of strategic ambiguity is based on the idea that keeping the two
sides guessing about how the United States will react in a crisis
restrains Taiwan's tendency toward recklessness and Beijing's tendency
toward aggression. Gilley and Glaser are recommending the United States
ditch that policy. Finally, [trading arms sales for a promise of
intervention would completely undermine the thrust of Gilley and
Glaser's original articles]{.underline}. On what basis can we conclude
that such a policy would be any less offensive to China than America's
current policy? Indeed, [Beijing would probably find the promise of
direct military intervention even more of an intrusion into China's
domestic affairs than arms sales]{.underline}. And **[surely such a
change in US policy would only accelerate]{.underline}** the development
Freeman is most concerned about, **[an expensive and destabilizing race
for military dominance between the United States and the
PRC]{.underline}**.

### 2NC Taiwan

#### No China-Taiwan conflict 

**Kastner 16**---PhD in Political Science from U of Cal (San Diego) and
an Associate Professor of Government and Politics at U of Maryland
\[Scott L., "Is the Taiwan Strait Still a Flash Point? Rethinking the
Prospects for Armed Conflict between China and Taiwan," *International
Security*, 40(3): 54-92\]

On the one hand, [there are several reasons]{.underline} to be
optimistic that [the Taiwan Strait **will not**]{.underline} again
[become a flash point for conflict even if the PRC\'s military
capabilities]{.underline} continue to [improve]{.underline}. First, as
noted earlier, it is hard to predict the long-term evolution of the
balance of military power in the Taiwan Strait, and as such it [is not a
given that a shift in the PRC\'s favor will]{.underline} indeed [become
the dominant trend in cross-strait relations]{.underline}. Some analysts
have suggested, for instance, that [Taiwan\'s defenses are quite
**strong**]{.underline}, particularly if [the U.S. commitment to the
island\'s security **remains robust**]{.underline}.100 Second, [even if
a shifting balance of power does become the dominant trend]{.underline}
in cross-strait relations, [it will not]{.underline} necessarily [become
so dominant that Beijing concludes it could reap greater benefits
from]{.underline} a cross-strait [war than it receives from the status
quo]{.underline}. That is, [even if the PRC is confident that it would
"win"]{.underline} a cross-strait war (in the context of figure 1, the
war outcome might lie very close to the unification end of the
continuum), [it might still view **the costs of war as prohibitively
high**]{.underline} (enough to keep China\'s redline to the right of the
status quo). Also, there is good reason to think that [these costs
are]{.underline} in fact [substantial and will remain so for the
foreseeable future]{.underline}. As Paul Godwin and Alice Miller write,
[a PRC-initiated war in the Taiwan Strait would **damage** the PRC\'s
"effort to be perceived as a constructive, responsible member of the
international community," which]{.underline} in turn [would "have
**undesirable consequences** for China\'s global **economic** and
commercial **links**."]{.underline}101 Finally, Taylor Fravel has shown
that [the PRC historically has been most likely to escalate territorial
disputes when its bargaining power is declining, not when it is
improving]{.underline}.102 This is a point emphasized in the pessimistic
trends-analysis scenario highlighted earlier. Indeed, if [Beijing is
confident that]{.underline}, over the long term, [factors such as
increasing cross-strait economic integration or increasing
people-to-people contacts across the]{.underline} Taiwan [Strait will
ultimately help to transform Taiwan\'s identity and make
unification]{.underline} more [palatable]{.underline} to Taiwan\'s
citizens, then [Chinese decisionmakers]{.underline} could [forgo the use
of force **even if** they believed they could win a better outcome
through war.]{.underline}

#### It's too risky for China due to military imbalances 

**Zhao 18** (Christina, citing Steve Tsang, political scientist and
director of the SOAS University of London\'s China Institute and

https://www.newsweek.com/will-china-invade-taiwan-next-5-years-depends-trump-experts-883324)

[Despite China\'s **clear designs**]{.underline} on the island it lost
when Mao Zedong\'s nationalist enemies fled there when he declared the
founding of Communist China in 1949, [it\'s unlikely that Beijing would
want to achieve]{.underline} **[reunification]{.underline}** [by means
of a]{.underline} **[full-scale war]{.underline}**. And [even if it did,
the mainland isn't guaranteed to win it.]{.underline} "[China does not
have the capability to do it in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[next
five years]{.underline}**. [If they did, an invasion could lose
them]{.underline} most of **[their frontline]{.underline}**, **[advanced
equipment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[troops]{.underline}** in
the process,\" Steve [Tsang, political scientist and director of the
SOAS University]{.underline} of London\'s China Institute, [told
Newsweek.]{.underline} Even [under]{.underline} President
**[Xi]{.underline}**, [Beijing is]{.underline} [relatively]{.underline}
**[risk averse]{.underline}**, Tsang argued. [The PLA is unlikely to
launch a military attack]{.underline} [unless they struck a deal with
the Trump administration]{.underline} to prevent U.S. interference.
Christopher R. [Hughes, professor of international relations at the
London School of Economics, is similarly **pessimistic**]{.underline}
[about China's chances.]{.underline} Taipei does not have a great
military power, but [the island is built like a **natural
fortress**]{.underline} [and its defenses are capable of
inflicting]{.underline} **[substantial damage]{.underline}**. "[The cost
of failure could potentially]{.underline} **[end the \[communist\]
regime]{.underline}**," he told Newsweek. The small island nation, 110
miles east of China, is protected by coastal artillery, state-of-the-art
mines, anti-ship missiles and batteries, and high-tech early warning
systems. The equipment is there to protect 10 percent of Taiwan's
shoreline that is suitable for amphibious landings. Taipei can also
speedily transport its 150,000 army troops around the island to defend
from the soldiers who successfully penetrate its fortress. Rather than
an invasion, [Beijing will]{.underline} probably [continue to play the
\"psychological game," Hughes said]{.underline}.

### \*\*\*Deterrence Turn\*\*\*

### 1NC Deterrence 

#### US arms sales to Taiwan are vital to maintaining deterrence which is the only chance of war with China 

**Cropsey 2018** (Seth Cropsey is a senior fellow at Hudson Institute
and director of its Center for American Seapower. He served as deputy
Undersecretary of the Navy in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush
administrations and is the author of "Seablindness," published by

<https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/402286-Taiwan-is-key-to-US-power-in-Pacific>
, 8/17/18)

[Sixth-century Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu wrote that "to fight
and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme
excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without
fighting." Sun Tzu, skeptical about prolonged warfare, favored swift,
decisive action; he preferred deception and psychological warfare to
subduing an enemy by force. Contemporary Chinese rulers sometimes
breathe the same strategic air as their distinguished
forebear]{.underline}. The Peoples' Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has
dispatched warships into the Taiwan Strait and conducted live-fire
drills. On more than one occasion, its Xian H-6 bombers have
circumnavigated Taiwan; in early summer, a Chinese destroyer and frigate
repeated that circumnavigation by sea. And Beijing has not renounced the
use of force to seize Taiwan. A Chinese military analyst and TV
personality told one of Beijing's state-run media outlets that it is
"legitimate" for China "to send strong signals like this," and that it
must be able to deal not only with Taiwan's military but potential U.S.
and Japanese intervention. This is foolish talk. Taiwan possesses 1.6
percent of the mainland's population; by the most generous estimate,
Taiwan's defense budget is one-twentieth of China's; the U.S. and Japan
would use force against China only if Beijing initiated hostilities.
Like Mikhail Gorbachev, who knew NATO would not invade the former Soviet
Union, Xi Jinping understands that neither Taiwan, nor the U.S. and
Japan, nor any combination of these represents a military threat to the
People's Republic of China (PRC). [China's increasing military exercises
are intended to convince the Taiwanese that resisting is useless. Sun
Tzu would approve: China seeks to achieve its objective --- the
absorption of democratic Taiwan into authoritarian China --- by
frightening and bullying. Yet, China also is increasing the amphibious
forces needed to put ground troops ashore.]{.underline} Since 2007 it
has constructed five amphibious ships similar in size and capability to
the U.S. Navy's 25,000-ton USS San Antonio-class LPD (landing platform
dock); the Chinese vessels carry up to 800 troops each, along with
landing craft and armored vehicles. It is building several larger
amphibious ships (40,000 tons), the first of which is to launch in 2020.
[China is going about intimidating Taiwan purposefully]{.underline}. The
list of provocative behavior is long: a build-up of armaments that can
be used specifically to attack Taiwan; sea and air exercises targeted at
Taiwan; unilaterally expanding its air-defense zone; sustained efforts
to isolate Taiwan diplomatically; Xi Jinping's 2017 statement to China's
19th Party Congress that the "Taiwan problem" is part of his plan for
"national rejuvenation." All point to increasing pressure on Taiwan's
democratic institutions and sovereignty. The United States has a large
interest in helping Taiwan remain sovereign --- not only because of its
democratic institutions or its strategic place in the island chain
bracketing China's east coast. We are committed by the Taiwan Relations
Act of 1979 to provide equipment and services Taiwan needs to defend
itself. **[Deterring China is the best means to lower tensions and
reduce the possibility that Beijing might decide to use
force]{.underline}** --- but U.S. policy in recent years has alternated
between good and dubious. An example of the former is Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo's July 30 speech restating U.S. commitment to protect
sovereignty in the region "from coercion by other countries," backed by
a pledge of \$300 million for Indo-Pacific security. Also on the
positive side was last month's transit of the Taiwan Strait by guided
missile destroyers USS Mustin and USS Benfold, reminding China that the
U.S. remains committed to regional stability and Taiwan's safety. More
such transits are needed --- as is overall administration policy as
tough-minded about defense as it is about trade. China is not likely to
regard the dispatch of an occasional naval vessel as serious American
support for Taiwan and the region. An American aircraft carrier has not
transited the Taiwan Strait since the USS Kitty Hawk, 11 years ago.
China would react with predictable sound and fury if the Trump
administration sailed a carrier through the strait. But the broad
midsection of the 110-mile-wide strait is international waters, and U.S.
policy has long insisted on a legal right to sail unrestricted on the
high seas. Another action to underline American support for Taiwan is
noted in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA); it
specifically expresses Congress's sense that the administration should
order Navy ships to call in Taiwanese ports. Congress understands the
geographic centrality of Taiwan in the First Island Chain, along with
the large strategic value of a free Taiwan in preserving America's
position as a great power in the West Pacific. The 2018 NDAA also
supports bilateral exercises with Taiwan's navy and exchanges of senior
military officers; this strengthens the ties between Washington and
Taipei that improve the interoperability of their military forces. If
the Trump administration listens, **[Congress's expressed interest and
such other measures as regular arms sales to Taiwan --- including
substantial assistance to help Taiwan build its own submarines and other
equipment needed to defend against China's growing arsenal --- will help
deter the PRC from precipitous action as well as
intimidation.]{.underline}** As demonstrated by the 2018 National
Defense Strategy, the Trump administration regards China as a "strategic
competitor." While the result of tariffs on Chinese goods remains
unknown, economic competition between the U.S. and China is central to
their broader contest. And China is challenging the U.S.'s technological
edge; for example, its \$10 billion investment in a quantum computing
research facility in Hefei dwarfs the approximately \$250 million of
annual U.S. federal spending on the same technology, which has
extraordinary potential for the security and economy of whichever
country holds the whip hand. [**In this competitive relationship,
Taiwan's security remains a large portion of America's interest in
future stability in the West Pacific. The U.S. will benefit itself and
its regional friends by increasing its tangible commitment to Taiwan and
the region**, in concert with the Trump administration's correct
understanding that China is a threat to American and allied interests.
Alongside his advice on using means other than force to achieve a
political objective, Sun Tzu noted that "the opportunity of defeating an
enemy is provided by the enemy himself." China's willingness to use
force demonstrates the enmity it holds for Taiwan. **By increasing the
deterrent value of Taiwan's defenses and those of our other allies in
the region, the U.S. and Taiwan help deny the PRC the opportunity to
accomplish its goal by threat or by force.**]{.underline}

JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii---[U.S. military forces in the
Pacific are alarmed by what they see as an increasingly capable China
using military intimidation and economic coercion to bully its smaller
neighbors. So far, these tactics fall short of actual armed conflict.
But U.S. defense officials here and in Washington, most of whom spoke on
condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, say if the United
States does not stay on alert in the region, Beijing could use force to
advance its interests---and Taiwan in particular is a major potential
flash point. Among the signs of Beijing's increasing aggression, a
Chinese warship came within 45 yards of the bow of a Navy destroyer in
the South China Sea late last year, a close encounter the service
characterized as "unsafe and unprofessional]{.underline}." Meanwhile,
the U.S. Navy has increased the frequency of movement through the
strategically important Taiwan Strait, including most recently on March
24, after China repeatedly sent military aircraft and ships to circle
the island for drills. [And in January, China's President Xi Jinping
warned that any efforts by the contested island democracy to assert its
full independence could be met by armed force, and he implicitly
threatened the United States if it tries to intervene.]{.underline} In
what appears to be a signal to China, [the]{.underline} Trump
[administration has reportedly given tacit approval to Taiwan's request
for 60 new F-16 fighter jets, prompting fresh protests from Beijing.
Previous administrations, including former Presidents George W. Bush and
Barack Obama, rejected Taiwan's request to buy new F-16s, likely so as
not to provoke China. But this time, while the formal process has not
yet been completed, officials and experts said it will likely go
through]{.underline} given President Donald Trump's administration's
more hawkish attitude toward China. John Bolton, Trump's national
security advisor, is a proponent of the deal, said one former defense
official. "There is a consensus that's almost bipartisan in Washington
that it's time to be a bit more assertive against China," said Richard
Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group. "This is the part where
fighters are geopolitics with wings." The U.S. military's increasing
concern over China's actions in the Pacific come amid tense negotiations
between the Trump administration and Beijing to end a tariff and trade
rules standoff that has roiled global markets. National and financial
security are inexorably tangled in the region, as China uses not just
military but also economic tactics to coerce its vulnerable neighbors.
"China represents our greatest long-term strategic threat to a free and
open Indo-Pacific, and to the United States," Adm. Phil Davidson, the
commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, recently warned the Senate.
Between the Spratly and Paracel islands in the South China Sea, China
has built roughly eight islands, populated with advanced surface-to-air
missiles and airfields that can support bombers and other aircraft, said
one U.S. Air Force official here. At the same time, Beijing has employed
dubious maritime tactics in the South China Sea, such as using disguised
military vessels, painted white to look like China Coast Guard ships, to
intimidate Vietnamese fishing boats. China also has between 100,000 and
150,000 fishing vessels that "at any point they could operationalize"
and use "to blockade, intimidate, or coerce other nations," the official
said. While an all-out war between the United States and China is
unlikely, Taiwan is the one place where the two countries' conflicting
interests could lead to a military confrontation, said one senior U.S.
defense official. Beijing has opposed any attempt by the island nation
to declare independence since 1949, when the two split after Mao
Zedong's Communists won China's civil war. "Separatists are the greatest
threat to internal order and the Communist Party in China," the official
said. "Preservation of the Party is the #1 goal of the Chinese
government, and one of the few interests that would lead them to risk a
military confrontation with the US." Xi's January comments seemed to
confirm this worry. "We make no promise to abandon the use of force, and
retain the option of taking all necessary measures," he said during the
speech in Beijing, stressing that reunification must be the ultimate
goal. Those options could also be used against "intervention by external
forces," Xi added. One U.S. military official here in Hawaii said the
United States must send a message to China's communist government that
it will stand behind democratic nations, particularly Taiwan. "Anytime a
nation says they are willing to forcibly assault an island, we should be
concerned," the official said. The United States has sent ships through
the Taiwan Strait three times already this year, and six times in total
since last July. The destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur and Coast Guard cutter
USCGC Bertholf conducted the most recent transit, which Cmdr. Clay Doss,
a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet, said "demonstrates the U.S.
commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific." [The United States must
also put a "premium" on transforming Taiwan's military and defense
capability so it can maintain a deterrent force, the military official
here said. That includes mobile air defense systems, anti-ship cruise
missiles, small fast attack boats, countermine capability, precision
artillery, and modern aircraft to patrol its airspace.]{.underline} "[No
one wants to be pulled into World War III]{.underline}," the official
said. [In an effort to beef up Taiwan's defenses, the U.S. military sold
more than \$25 billion of equipment to Taipei from 2007 to
2018.]{.underline} There has also been talk of selling Lockheed Martin's
newest stealth fighter jet, the F-35, to Taiwan. Last week, Taiwan's
chief of the general staff, Adm. Lee Hsi-ming, visited Luke Air Force
Base in Arizona, home to scores of U.S. and international F-35s. But a
second senior defense official said an F-35 sale to Taipei likely would
not be approved as it is "just a little leap too far with the advanced
technology." If the F-16 sale actually happens---and the two senior U.S.
defense officials caution it is far from a done deal---it would be in
addition to the country's roughly 140 older F-16 aircraft, which are
currently being upgraded to the latest standard. Any foreign military
sale is a lengthy, complex process that involves approval by the Defense
Department, State Department, and Congress. Aside from Taiwan, the
United States is also looking to increase its arms sales to other
countries in the region, which buy a lot of military equipment from
Russia and China, said another U.S. Air Force official here. However, it
is difficult for some of these poorer nations to get over the "sticker
shock" of American equipment, the official said. [The push to increase
arms sales to Pacific nations is in part an attempt to counter China's
Belt and Road Initiative. Through this effort, China is developing
infrastructure and investing financially in countries across the world,
particularly in its Pacific backyard. In a move that upset Washington
and Brussels on Saturday, Italy became the first G-7 country to join the
project.]{.underline}

### Deterrence True

#### Key to avoid allies becoming victims of [coercion]{.underline}

Jerry **Meyerle 14**, Ph.D., senior research scientist in CNA's Center
for Strategic Studies, 12/9/14, "THE U.S. NEEDS A MORE TAILORED &
DISCRIMINATE DETERRENCE REGIME,"
http://warontherocks.com/2014/12/the-u-s-military-will-need-more-low-end-strike-options-in-the-second-nuclear-age/

[**Challenges to American primacy** from a newly aggressive Russia and a
militarily growing China suggest]{.underline} that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs]{.underline} a robust
nuclear deterrent now more than ever. Today's threats also call for
[high-end conventional capabilities that promise to protect U.S.
military dominance and enable rapid victory]{.underline} in any major
conflict. If the United States is to remain the world's number one
superpower, it cannot afford to fall behind. [**At the same time**, it
is unlikely]{.underline} that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will fight a major war with]{.underline} a serious
military power such as [Russia or China]{.underline}, least of all use
nuclear weapons. The [conflicts]{.underline} that the the United States
is most likely to become embroiled in [will remain at the lower bounds
of the warfare spectrum, where wars can be fought without large-scale
destruction]{.underline}. Any major power that seeks to challenge
American primacy would be unwise to do so by fighting a major war or
threatening to use nuclear weapons. [Challenges are more likely to come
through **small-scale** attacks]{.underline} and repeated confrontations
that promise to gradually chip away at U.S. authority. [U.S. forces need
to be able to respond to **these challenges** in ways that signal
strength and resolve]{.underline}. This is where the United States is
least prepared. Despite all the talk about the United States maintaining
its military technological edge and the search for a new offset
strategy, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, as
well as the spread of other high-end military technologies, threaten to
restrict U.S. options in future conflicts. It may be increasingly
difficult for the United States to take military action without
escalation toward a major conventional war or even a nuclear war. The
costs and risks of such an outcome are too high to fathom. Because
nuclear weapons appear to take major war and regime change off the
table, they promise greater space for smaller powers to conduct proxy
warfare, violent provocations, and even limited military operations at
lower levels of escalation. These developments pose a dilemma for the
United States and other status quo powers: responding militarily could
lead to escalation and the risk of nuclear war, but failing to do so
could lead to a cascade of low-level coercion in the future
[Salami-slicing tactics by Russia in Ukraine and China in the western
Pacific pose a serious threat to American primacy]{.underline}. Russia
under Vladimir Putin is challenging the United States and NATO not by
massing forces or threatening nuclear attack, but by waging a
semi-covert proxy war against the West. Russia's actions in Ukraine are
part of an incremental campaign of escalation meant to test the limits
of what the United States is willing accept and its resolve to take
military action against another nuclear power. In this battle of wills,
Russia so far appears to have the upper hand. China's actions in the
western Pacific pale in comparison to the blatant aggression evinced by
Russia in Ukraine. Nonetheless, [China has]{.underline} for years [been
gradually chipping away at American primacy in the Pacific through
repeated confrontations with the naval vessels and aircraft of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies]{.underline}.
Patrick Cronin has coined the term "tailored coercion" to refer to
low-level aggression by China against Japan and several Southeast Asian
countries, as well as U.S. naval forces, in pursuit of disputed maritime
claims. Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals serve as a shield behind
which to poke and prod the United States and its allies. Some experts
have argued that Russia has been increasing its reliance on nuclear
weapons in recent years as a means to counter advances in U.S. precision
strike capabilities, and may even be seeking nuclear superiority as the
U.S. continues to reduce its nuclear arsenal. China is also in the
process of modernizing its nuclear capabilities. Second-tier powers,
such as North Korea and Pakistan, are also growing their nuclear
capabilities. Iran, it appears, is pursuing a nuclear capability of its
own. Since acquiring nuclear weapons, North Korea and Pakistan have
engaged in coercive and violent provocations, calculating that their
larger rivals would concede rather than risk escalation that could lead
to nuclear use. These include torpedo and artillery strikes on South
Korean forces in 2010, and limited ground incursions and terrorist
attacks against India in 1999 and 2001 that were attributed to Pakistan.
These actions threaten to destabilize key regions unless measures can be
devised to deter acts of coercion at the lower bounds of the warfare
spectrum. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will need a
more **tailored** and discriminate **deterrent** to address these
threats. Policymakers will need **options** that **promise to deter
adversaries at the low-end**]{.underline} as well as the high end, [in
order to dissuade potential adversaries from attempting to coerce the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies]{.underline}.
At the same time, [U.S. leaders will need tools]{.underline} -- military
and diplomatic -- [aimed at **controlling escalation and minimizing the
risk of nuclear use**. This will be important for extended deterrence as
well, because allies and partners are the more likely victims of
low-level coercion]{.underline}. **[Defending them against coercive
pressure]{.underline}** [will be **important for continued U.S.
influence in Asia**]{.underline}. [Forward-deployed conventional forces
capable of **calibrated responses to low-level attacks** are likely to
play a central role]{.underline}. Nuclear threats are not likely to be
credible against anything short of a major act of war. U.S. commanders
will need a variety of military options below the threshold of major
combat operations, aimed at sending a message rather than disarming an
adversary. [These options will need to be proportionate, timely,
precise, and calculated to signal]{.underline} both [resolve and
restraint]{.underline}. [Capabilities that might enable such responses
include **tactically oriented ~~unmanned~~ \[unstaffed\] platforms**,
**conventional cruise missiles**, **special operations forces**, and
non-kinetic options such as cyber and electronic attack]{.underline}.
Employing ground forces may not be advisable, given the risks of
becoming tied down in a protracted conflict. Attempts to deter
small-scale attacks through limited military operations could involve
considerable risk of escalation. [Escalation control measures must be
integrated into war plans and concepts of operation. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [may need to **allow adversary
leaders a way out in a crisis** in order to avoid trapping them in an
escalatory spiral. In the event of a strike that could be perceived as a
strategic threat, it may be advisable to signal that the attack is
limited]{.underline}, through public statements, discreet diplomatic and
military channels, and careful choice of targets, weapons, and flight
paths. [Recent exploits by Russia in Ukraine and China in the western
Pacific threaten to **chip away at U.S. power and influence** unless
effective responses can be developed]{.underline}. [Policymakers will
need strong but proportionate military options designed to counter and
deter offensive actions at lower levels of conflict while controlling
follow-on escalation. This may require a more diverse array of usable
conventional capabilities that pose less risk of escalation, as well as
greater attention to escalation control in military
planning]{.underline} and concepts of operation.

#### Perfect deterrence theory is correct -- empirical evidence, logical assumptions and previous tests -- prefer our epistemology and reject their evidence about immediate deterrence

**Quackenbush 10** \~{Stephen L., Associate Professor in the Department
of Political Science (University of Missouri -- Colombia), Ph.D. and
M.A. in Political Science (University at Buffalo, SUNY), Director of the
Strategic Studies Program at Missouri, \"General Deterrence and
International Conflict: Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory,\"
International Interactions,
36, <http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03050620903554069>}\
The need for immediate deterrence indicates that general deterrence

has previously failed (Danilovic 2001). If general deterrence succeeds,
crises and wars do not occur. Since general deterrence necessarily
precedes immediate deterrence, the analysis of general deterrence is
more fundamental to an understanding of international conflict than is
an analysis of immediate deterrence. Furthermore, because of selection
effects, [examining immediate deterrence without consideration of
general deterrence can lead to misleading empirical
results]{.underline}. As Fearon (2002:15) observes, "hypotheses that are
valid for general deterrence should appear exactly reversed if we look
at cases of immediate deterrence." Unfortunately, a divide exists
between formal theories and the empirical analysis of deterrence. One
reason for this divide is that while formal theories have focused on
general deterrence, [the quantitative literature has focused almost
exclusively on immediate deterrence]{.underline} (Huth 1999). Important
exceptions include Weede (1983), who examined extended deterrence in the
cold war, and Sorokin (1994), who examined the impact of alliance
formation on extended general deterrence within the Arab--Israeli
conflict. Given their focus on extended deterrence, these studies are
unable to provide insight on direct general deterrence. Huth and Russett
(1993) did examine direct general deterrence within the context of
enduring rivalries. [They find that the balance of forces, arms races,
and domestic conflict are all important determinants of deterrence
outcomes]{.underline}. [However, they do not directly test any specific
theory of deterrence;]{.underline} indeed, formal theories of general
deterrence have never been subjected to direct empirical testing.
Indeed, this problem has unfortunately plagued formal theories
throughout political science (Green and Shapiro 1994), not only in the
study of deterrence. This is unfortunate since deterrence theory appears
to shed great light on the dynamics of deterrence, yet without extensive
empirical analysis, one cannot know how well these theories explain
real-world phenomena. One reason for this lack of testing is that, while
selection of immediate deterrence cases has received a great deal of
attention (for example, Huth and Russett 1984, 1988, 1990; Huth 1988),
criteria for the selection of general deterrence cases have remained
elusive. This paper has two related purposes. The specific purpose is to
fill this evidentiary gap by subjecting perfect deterrence theory---a
recently developed theory of general deterrence---to a systematic test.
I do so for several reasons. First, [perfect deterrence
theory]{.underline} (Zagare and Kilgour 2000) [is supported by a formal
logic with explicit theoretical expectations that facilitates empirical
testing]{.underline}. Second, several preliminary tests of perfect
deterrence theory have rendered promising, albeit provisional results
(Senese and Quackenbush 2003; Quackenbush and Zagare 2006).1 And
finally, as Huth (1999) points out, standard formulations of
deterrence---to the extent that they have been explored
empirically---are without compelling support. The more general purpose
is to develop the conceptualization and procedures to make such a test
possible. This is necessary to bridge the divide between formal theories
and quantitative analyses of deterrence. Key conceptualizations include
case selection for direct general deterrence---I argue that
**[identifying opportunity for conflict is the key]{.underline}**. In
addition, this paper offers the first direct test of incomplete
information equilibrium predictions made by formal deterrence theory.
Conducting such a test requires measurement of the utilities the actors
have for the different outcomes that may emerge, so a modification of
the measurement procedures developed by Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman
(1992) is used. Also, since incomplete information equilibria depend on
each state's estimate of the opponent's credibility, a nonlinear
transformation technique is developed to estimate the credibility
parameters. To test perfect deterrence theory, I examine general
deterrence from 1816--2000. After detailing the equilibrium predictions
of perfect deterrence theory's unilateral deterrence game, I more fully
discuss the research design used to test them, including case selection,
measurement of variables, and statistical method. In the next section, I
discuss the empirical results and the theory's ability to explain
general deterrence and international conflict. [The results indicate
that perfect deterrence theory is well supported by the empirical
record.]{.underline} Finally, I compare these findings to previous
results supporting Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's (1992) international
interaction game that is the basis of one of the most influential and
important theories of interstate conflict.

[The potential for PRC coercive use of force to resolve political
differences with Taiwan]{.underline} has been the primary flash point in
the region and likely [will remain so for the foreseeable future. **A
relative erosion of Taiwan's military capabilities could create
opportunities and incentives for Beijing's political and military
leadership to assume greater risk in imposing their own agenda on
cross-Strait relations, including resorting to force to resolve their
difference with Taiwan. This is also the contingency that is most likely
to bring the U.S. and China into armed conflict**]{.underline}. [Beijing
has long viewed U.S. arms sales to Taiwan in a predominately political
context.]{.underline} Yet [the U.S. and]{.underline}, to a lesser
extent[, Taiwan have both approached arms sales issues from a primarily
military perspective]{.underline}. [China presumes that U.S. arms sales
to Taiwan are encouraging Taiwan independence sentiments on the
island]{.underline}. However, such assertions are no less difficult to
prove than the previously mentioned cause-effect linkage between arms
sales and breakthroughs in cross-Strait relations. [The single most
important factor in **alienating the people of Taiwan**]{.underline},
and thereby a large factor in encouraging independence sentiments, [is
the PRC's coercive military posture opposite Taiwan]{.underline}.51
**[If it truly desired a reduction in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the PRC
would begin substantive reductions in its own military
posture]{.underline}**. [This would have to include redeployment or
closure of conventional SRBM and MRBM brigades opposite Taiwan, along
with the dismantling of static infrastructure supporting missile
operations -- such as rail transfer points and brigade/base-level
underground missile assembly/checkout centers.]{.underline} Removal of
the missiles has been an important issue both under Taiwan President Ma
Ying-jeou and his predecessor, President Chen Shui-bian. The Ma
administration has explicitly established the removal of the SRBMs
opposite Taiwan as a pre-condition for initiation of political
negotiations that could potentially lead to a cross-Strait peace
agreement.52 Barring a substantive reduction in the Chinese military
posture opposite Taiwan, the U.S. should -- and most likely will --
continue to provide Taiwan with weapons of a defensive character, as
mandated under the TRA. Key issues currently on the table include an
outstanding request for additional F-16C/Ds and a Congressional
notification for a diesel-electric submarine design program valued at
US\$360 million. Past behavior indicates that **[the PRC is unlikely to
challenge any fundamental U.S. interests in response to future releases
of significant military articles and services to Taiwan]{.underline}**.
Congressional notifications will likely remain the primary trigger for
Chinese responses -- rather than earlier decision-points in the process,
such as providing P&A data in response to an LOR. With the exception of
AECA Section 36(b) and Section 36(c), there is no legal requirement, nor
any practical reasons, to publicly announce Taiwan arms sales decisions.
However, there may be political reasons to do so. Based on past
experiences, announcements of DCS programs -- including tech transfer,
licensed assembly, or cooperative development -- are likely to result in
a more subdued response. This is perhaps due to the absence of a
detailed reporting requirement, as notifications under AECA Section
36(c) for DCS programs need not be as specific as for those under AECA
36(b) for FMS programs. [Future Chinese actions taken in response to
Taiwan arms sales could include sanctions against the U.S.
companies]{.underline} that are supporting FMS programs or undertaking
DCS programs. But major U.S. defense industrial firms, such as Lockheed
Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon, conduct only minor business in
China. Smaller companies -- such as those providing engine and other
sub-system or sub-assembly supplies for the F-16 -- could potentially be
affected. However, such smaller companies are unlikely to become targets
for sanctions due to their peripheral involvement as sub-contractors and
because small companies also have lesser value as symbolic targets. In
addition, [if a U.S. company faces discrimination in China as a result
of sanctions stemming from Taiwan arms sales, such a case could
certainly be introduced to the WTO for adjudication]{.underline}. This
would be especially true if the company was participating in a free and
open government competition in China. The PRC would then be compelled to
justify any substantive sanctions on national security grounds,
presumably arguing their case based on the notion that Taiwan is an
integral part of China and that arms sales are a threat to Chinese
national interests and territorial integrity. However,
[Beijing]{.underline} likely [understands that]{.underline}
[i]{.underline}nternational [law is not on its side]{.underline} when it
comes to Taiwan sovereignty issues.

#### Arms sales to Taiwan are critical for the regional balance of power---they prevent China from broader power projection

Sevastopulo in Washington and Edward White in Taipei, "US-China: Why
Taiwan is back on the agenda",

A US Senate delegation visiting Beijing in March expected its
conversations with Chinese officials to be dominated by talk of a trade
war between the two countries and President Donald Trump's plans to meet
North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un. Instead the five-member delegation ---
visiting on the same day that Mr Kim was in the Chinese capital ---
received an earbashing from Chinese officials seething over Taiwan. [The
meetings came just weeks after the Senate had passed, and Mr Trump had
signed, the Taiwan Travel Act, which formally encouraged more exchanges
between US officials and their counterparts on the free, democratic and
self-governed island]{.underline}. For Chinese officials, Taiwan is an
inalienable part of their sovereign territory that they believe they
will one day recover. For Washington the "One China policy" is the
"bedrock" of Sino-US relations. Under a diplomatic fudge that has lasted
four decades, the US formally recognises Beijing but also maintains
unofficial ties with the island of 23m people. In an effort to calm his
angry hosts at the National People's Congress on March 28, Steve Daines,
the Montana Republican who led the US delegation, focused his closing
remarks on their concerns about US-Taiwan relations. According to three
people who attended the meeting, the senator concluded by saying that
"we only have one embassy in China, here in Beijing, and one ambassador
who is sitting right next to me" as he gestured towards Terry Branstad
who took up the ambassadorship last year. The senator's deft diplomatic
response is a reminder that, [for Beijing, Taiwan and other "core
interests" related to territorial sovereignty could be the real
tripwires in the world's most consequential bilateral relationship,
rather than more visible friction over trade and North
Korea]{.underline}. Indeed, [for decades it was Taiwan --- rather than
China's more recent militarisation of outposts in the South China Sea
--- that was viewed as the most likely trigger for any clash between
Chinese and US forces. Taiwan is also a key link in the "first-island
chain" --- stretching from South Korea in the north to the Philippines
in the south --- that restricts China's ability to project power into
the western Pacific. **US support for Taiwan through arms sales is a
critical component of the regional balance of power.**]{.underline}

### [2NC /1NR Aggression Link]{.underline}

**Reducing arms sales makes China more aggressive**

**Wang 10**

(Yuan-kang Wang, Brookings Institute, November 2010, "China's Growing
Strength, Taiwan\'s Diminishing Options",
<http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2010/11/china-taiwan-wang> :)

**[A reassessment of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, however, would have
tremendous implications for Taiwan's security]{.underline}**. Over the
decades, **[U.S. support has been the indispensible factor for the
survival of the island]{.underline}**. The U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense
Treaty, in effect from 1954 to 1980, provided an alliance that
guaranteed Taiwan's security. U.S.-Taiwan security relations continued
after Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing, and
sustained arms sales to Taiwan helped strengthen the island\'s defense.
[The Taiwan Relations Act, enacted by U.S. Congress in 1979, stipulates
that "the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense
articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to
enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability.]{.underline}" **[The arms sales, in addition to
strengthening Taiwan's defense, also indicate the level of political
support from Washington]{.underline}**. Beijing sought to restrict U.S.
arms sale to Taiwan in the August 17, 1982 Communiqué. But before he
formally agreed to the communiqué, President Reagan secretly sent an
envoy to deliver what became known as the Six Assurances to Taipei
affirming that Washington would not "set a date for ending arms sales to
Taiwan."\[5\] [The pledge not to set a termination date, however, may be
meaningless if Washington does not sell Taiwan the equipment that it
needs]{.underline}.

Will These Actions Help or Hurt Taiwan? For all of Beijing's bravado
about its determination to "defend" a sovereignty over Taiwan that it
has never actually exercised, China will hesitate to attack the U.S.
military kinetically for fear of escalation into an uncontrollable
confrontation. It could, however, punish Taiwan. Chinese sources have
warned of further actions, with the PRC's foreign supporters urging that
Washington not do anything that might cross Beijing's red lines. It is
not clear exactly what actions short of a declaration of
independence---which neither of Taiwan's major political parties has any
intention of doing---would trigger these reactions. And, it must be
pointed out, [**American immobilism for fear of triggering a response
plays exactly into the anaconda strategy: the gradual tightening will go
on.** So far, United States responses, while pleasing the overwhelming
majority of Taiwanese who do not favor unification with China, have been
largely symbolic. More needs to be done to counter the
anaconda]{.underline}. High-level reciprocal visits, despite having been
congressionally sanctioned, have not yet taken place---but should. There
was disappointment that the U.S. did not send a higher-ranking
representative to the opening ceremony for the new American Institute in
Taiwan facility. The U.S. navy should regularly send its ships,
including aircraft carrier battle groups, through the Taiwan Strait; its
air force should conduct patrols in the area. Joint military exercises
between the U.S. and Taiwan's military should become routine, with
Taiwan invited to participate in the annual multinational Rim of the
Pacific (RIMPAC) exercises. The timing seems right: there are persistent
rumors about Xi Jinping being criticized within the PRC's leadership
elite for economic shortcomings, his overly aggressive behavior and
reckless actions that have aroused foreign backlash as well as for the
excesses of his personality cult. Continued American inaction will
simply validate Xi's conviction that these policies are working. To
reverse Mao Zedong's advice to the Soviet Union, if the west wind does

Strength, Taiwan\'s Diminishing Options",
<http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2010/11/china-taiwan-wang> :)

Recently, [China has struck a more assertive tone in its
foreign]{.underline} [policy]{.underline}. [The call to replace the
dollar as the international reserve currency, Chinese resistance to a
tougher climate change]{.underline} accord in Copenhagen, [the
reassertion of Chinese sovereignty in the South China Sea]{.underline},
[and the hardball tactics against Japan in the East China
Sea]{.underline} [are all indications of an increasingly assertive
China]{.underline} on the world stage. China had kept a low profile when
it needed a stable international environment to accumulate economic and
military power. [Now, with the world\'s second largest economy and
increased military capabilities, China is in a better position to pursue
its foreign policy interests]{.underline}. **[China's growing military,
economic, and political capabilities make it ever more important for
Taiwan to strengthen its relations with the United
States]{.underline}**. As the weaker power in cross-Strait relations,
[it makes good strategic sense for Taiwan to have the support of
Washington in case Beijing changes its intentions]{.underline}. In
truth, [Taiwan cannot rest its security on the goodwill of
China.]{.underline} [Taiwan needs allies]{.underline}. [To deter China
and to preserve Taiwan's political autonomy and survival, **Taiwan must
strengthen its self-defense capabilities**]{.underline}. In the midst of
cross-Strait dialogues, [Taiwan should negotiate from a position of
strength rather than from a position of weakness]{.underline}. [With
strengthened defense capabilities, Taiwan would more likely get
favorable terms in cross-Strait negotiations and not be forced to
accommodate Beijing's demands]{.underline}. In early 2010, the Obama
administration authorized a \$6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan. [As the
cross-Strait military balance continues to shift in Beijing\'s favor,
the arms sale can help Taiwan beef up its defense and boost confidence
on the island. There is still room for growth in Taiwan-U.S. military
exchanges and defense cooperation]{.underline}. [Building strong
military to military ties with the United States is the best hedge
against a change in Chinese intentions in the future]{.underline}.

#### Arms sales are key to Taiwanese defense credibility---specifically in the air

**Cheng 2018** (Dean Cheng is a senior research fellow in The Heritage
Foundation's Asian Studies Center. "Don\'t Listen To China: U.S. Arms
Sales to Taiwan Are Right Thing to Do",
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/dont-listen-china-us-arms-sales-taiwan-are-right-thing-do-32397>
, 10/2/2018)

[The United States on Sept. 24 announced a new set of arms sales to
Taiwan. Valued at \$330 million, this sale comprises mainly spare parts
and equipment to support Taiwan's air force, including its F-16s and
C-130s. This marks the second major arms sale to Taiwan by the Trump
administration]{.underline}, following a \$1.4 billion sale in June 2017
that included long-range missiles and heavy torpedoes. Not surprisingly,
Beijing promptly denounced the sale. The Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman declared that "the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan severely violates
the international law \[and\] the basic norms governing international
relations." The Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman warned that the U.S.
move severely violated U.S.-China relations, "interfered with China's
domestic affairs and harmed China's sovereignty and security interests,
and seriously damaged China-U.S. ties, relations between the two
militaries, as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait."
The arms sales announcement came not only amid another round of tariffs
in the slowly escalating trade clashes between the United States and
China, but also right after the U.S. imposed sanctions against the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). Because the Chinese purchased
Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia, the
U.S. announced sanctions required by the Countering America's
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017 against the PLA's Equipment
Development Department and its director, Lt. Gen. Li Shangfu. The
Chinese, meanwhile, canceled a meeting between Vice Adm. Shen Jinlong
(head of the Chinese navy) and U.S. Chief of Naval Operations John
Richardson with only 48 hours' notice. They also denied the USS Wasp
access to Hong Kong for a port call. It is unclear whether these Chinese
actions are more in response to the sanctions or the arms sales, or
perhaps the broader deterioration of U.S.-China ties. [The new arms
sales will help Taiwan maintain]{.underline} some semblance of
[credibility in its own defense, especially in the air. As China has
increased its pressure on Taiwan (e.g., employing financial diplomacy to
erode Taiwan's diplomatic standing), preserving Taiwan's ability to
maintain control of its own airspace will be vital.]{.underline}

Taiwan's new defense concept presents both challenges and opportunities
for cooperation with the U.S. military. [Sales of large, expensive
U.S.-made arms have certain benefits --- they are a visible and
**tangible signal of U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense, which boosts
morale in Taiwan and uncertainty in Beijing, and they are a critical
form of political deterrence in that respect**. U.S.-supplied systems
also provide the potential for interoperability with the U.S. military,
and potentially other countries in the region. Taiwan's proximity to
China is an advantage that could benefit networked U.S. forces operating
at greater stand-off distances. For example, a sensor operated by Taiwan
could feed data to networked U.S. planes and ships operating at a
distance to increase their awareness of threats and improve
targeting.]{.underline}

Past Economic Risks and Pin Hopes on Trump for Trade Deal." The New York
Times. January 23, 2019.
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/us/politics/china-trump-trade-deals.html>

[America's corporate leaders are **shrugging off a monthslong trade
war**, a protracted government shutdown and other looming economic
threats, projecting that revenue growth in 2019 will be strong largely
on the assumption that President Trump will reach a deal with
China]{.underline}. They seem to be increasingly isolated in that view.
[In **earnings calls** and interviews, executives at some of the largest
companies in the United States have played down what many economists and
analysts see as possible obstacles]{.underline} to economic expansion
both at home and abroad. In addition to the shutdown and the trade war,
the challenges include recent signs of weakness in manufacturing data
and slowing growth in China and Europe. [Business leaders are instead
expressing confidence that the Trump administration and Chinese
officials will strike a trade agreement before midnight on March 2, when
tariffs on Chinese imports are set to more than double, and keep the
economy humming]{.underline}. "We think the trade talk is going to be
winding down over the next two or three months, the government shutdown
will be figured out," Kelly King, the chief executive of BB&T
Corporation, said last week while discussing the bank's fourth-quarter
earnings in a conference call with analysts. Marianne [Lake, JPMorgan
Chase's chief financial officer]{.underline}, was similarly upbeat in
comments to reporters last week. "Put aside the shutdown and China trade
and all that," Ms. Lake [said.]{.underline} "The [underlying statistics
of the global economy are not bad."]{.underline} Jamie Dimon, the bank's
chief executive, said the same day that he remained confident that a
trade agreement was near and that with the deadline looming "enough will
be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal."
And Mr. Trump continues to project confidence that a trade deal is
within reach, telling reporters on Wednesday that "we're doing very well
in our negotiation with China." "China very much wants to make a deal,"
he said. "We'll see what happens. I like where we are right now."
[Corporate leaders are eager to continue what has been a sustained run
of growth, and historically high profits, since the financial crisis.
**Their optimism defies gloomier predictions**]{.underline} from chief
financial officers, nearly half of whom predicted in a Duke University
survey last year that there would be a recession in 2019. Federal

they have signaled at least a temporary pause in interest rate increases
as they wait to see if trade tensions and other headwinds slow down the
economy.

, Feb. 2019)

But such failures do not obviate the reality that the long-held
bipartisan strategy of engaging China from a principled position of
strength now requires adjustment to reflect Beijing's growing
assertiveness and the new reality of our more competitive bilateral
relationship. [Engagement from a principled position of strength always
included an adjustable mix of cooperation, deterrence, and pressure.
That strategy has]{.underline} basically [been successful, enhancing
regional stability for decades, convincing China to forego the use of
force in its many regional disputes in the South China Sea and East
China Sea, and encouraging China to pursue economic marketization and
reassurance policies toward its neighbors. This approach also allowed
the United States and China to manage their differences while
cooperating on many global issues of common interest such as fostering
trade, addressing climate change, and preventing nuclear proliferation.
In response to China's growing assertiveness in military and foreign
policy matters in the past ten years, as well as its increasingly
mercantilist economic policies, the United States must respond with a
course correction, altering the mix of cooperation and pressure to more
strongly emphasize pressure and deterrence. But we do not call for the
United States to pivot toward a latter-day containment policy or give up
seeking cooperation with China where it can. In fact, a tougher approach
of pushback against Chinese assertiveness and destabilizing policies
gives us the maximum chance that China will return to the more
cooperative and less destabilizing policies it had adopted
earlier.]{.underline}

we have a further set of signposts that the probability of a severe
trade war is playing out, and hence cause for asset prices to adjust
further towards the end state.

A keen understanding of these and other potential escalation points can
guide portfolio construction. There is no immediate need to adjust
portfolios to a fully defensive strategy if there is time to correct
one's course as events play out. Indeed, [we **do not

out]{.underline}. Instead, [we think it more likely]{.underline} that [a
combination of a clear understanding of the benefits of
trade]{.underline}, on one side, [and institutional **constraints and

for further escalation.]{.underline} In other words, at some point we
expect the probability of a severe scenario to fall back; asset prices
should then step down and there might at that point be an opportunity to
take more risk.

The interplay between economics and politics was undoubtedly a dominant
feature of analyses during 2016. As we know, [it was difficult to
foresee both election results and their economic consequences. It
was]{.underline} certainly [not strange that economists were unable
to]{.underline} predict the Brexit referendum outcome or [Donald Trump's
victory, when public opinion polling organisations and betting firms
failed to do so,]{.underline} but lessons might be learned from the
economic assessment impacts they made. [Economists]{.underline} probably
tend to [**exaggerate** the importance of more general political
phenomena. While in the midst of elections that appear historically
important, it is tempting to present **alarmist
projections**]{.underline} about election outcomes that seem improbable
and/or unpleasant. [But once the initial shock effect has
faded,]{.underline} more [ordinary economic data such as corporate

Psychological effects often exaggerated¶ [One important observation is
that **it is difficult to find any historical correlation between

perhaps because [uncertainty is offset by investments in a defence

faith that a response would come]{.underline}. Not until after a lengthy
period of inept actions by decision makers did these crises become
genuinely acute, with large secondary effects as a consequence. [This
market \"patience\" is presumably based on a long-time pattern of
recurring bailout measures by governments and central
banks]{.underline}, which usually benefit risk-taking at the expense of
caution or speculation that policy responses will not materialise.¶ [It
is reasonable to assume that this may also underpin the rather cautious
reactions to the risks associated with the Trump administration\'s

https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/421693-contrary-to-popular-belief-trumps-tariffs-are-working

Throughout 2018, there has been a constant wave of criticism regarding
the tariffs that President Trump imposed on an array of imports,
principally from China. However, the [evidence shows that the tariffs
are actually working. Economic **growth is up**, **inflation is under
control**, and many of the tariffed industries are enjoying **strong
recoveries**]{.underline} in output, profits and employment. An economic
analysis we conducted at the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA)
explains why we are seeing stronger economic growth this year and can
also expect more gains over the next three years. The economic numbers
in 2018 are already impressive. In the third quarter of this year,
[growth in inflation-adjusted GDP (the broadest measure of U.S. economic
activity) came in at 3.5 percent. That's far **better than most
economists expected** a year ago. The Commerce Department is also
reporting that **consumer spending was up**]{.underline} a strong 0.6
percent in October. That's good, too, but even more stunning is the data
showing online consumer sales were up 23.6 percent for "Black Friday"
compared with last year. Economists and [retailers are now expecting
**strong holiday sales**, driven by **low unemployment**, with wages
rising slightly faster than inflation. Even more impressive is the
**growth in America's manufacturing** sector. Despite continual
predictions that the proverbial sky is falling, the Trump tariffs have
actually **combined with other policies** to trigger an economic
boom]{.underline} for U.S. manufacturing. Federal data shows U.S factory
employment up 296,000 jobs compared with a year ago. And manufacturers
are reporting that demand for their products has increased in a broad
range of industries --- including everything from tiny medical devices
to heavy construction machinery. This mirrors the closely-watched
[**Purchasing Managers' Index**, which shows broad optimism across U.S.
manufacturing. The tariffs have contributed to this growth, both
directly and indirectly. In the four main areas where tariffs were
imposed --- steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines --- the
U.S. has directly added **more than 11,000 jobs** as of
August]{.underline}. Since then, more investments and jobs have been
announced --- including a massive \$1.5 billion steel plant by Steel
Dynamics that will employ some 600 workers. And in the solar arena,
Solar Power World magazine lists more than a dozen U.S. companies where
new facilities have been "started and/or expanded."

[Trade wars **won't sharply curtail economic activity**]{.underline},
unless they cause businesses to lose confidence, said Spencer Dale,
chief economist for BP, the energy giant. The bigger problem, he said,
is that [trade wars could "eat away at trend growth]{.underline}" by
[reducing G.D.P. by a **fraction of a percent a year**]{.underline}.
That might not seem meaningful in any given year, but [**compounded over
a decade or two**, it could leave the economy noticeably short of what
it might otherwise have achieved]{.underline}.

The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has also noted those risks. "Changes
in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook," he said
on Wednesday at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal.

[Still, the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [remains
more insulated from a trade shock than other countries. Exports account
for just 12 percent of American **g**]{.underline}ross

nearly [70 percent of G.D.P]{.underline}. And [recent
surveys]{.underline} and other data [show]{.underline} that [people are

[U.S. President **Trump's tariffs**]{.underline} unleashed a global
terror. Trade war fears are everywhere. They've hamstrung world stocks
all year! Trump's primary target? China! That's one reason why Chinese
stocks are in a bear market, with many fearing economic fallout. But
here is a secret: Trump's taxes [are **too tiny** to squash global
economic growth --- or China's]{.underline}. See this correctly and
you'll find opportunity lurking. What you just read probably sounds
nuts. Economists everywhere warn of tariffs' negative impact, invoking
comparisons to the 1930s, when huge global tariffs contributed to the
West's economic depression. Stock analysts are sure the so-called "trade
war" is why the shine is off global stocks outside China, which have
surrendered most of their year-to-date gains. But most pundits presume
China will suffer most. They fret Trump is trying to prevent China's
ongoing economic development. That's why, they claim, the Shanghai index
is down 19% this year. Shenzhen is worse, down 25.8%. Tariffs are
negative. A tax on imported goods. Consumers in the nation implementing
them usually end up paying higher prices as a result. They can interrupt
the global supply chain by adding costs and friction. Exporters can be
whacked too! Hence why tariff fears seem to stoke global volatility and
weigh on China's stock market. And lead many to fear economic problems
await. But China's stock swoon seems disconnected from economic reality
--- a move based on fear. Not fact. For example, when China posted 6.5%
gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter --- the slowest
in a decade --- some blamed tariffs. But this is a little odd. First,
consider trade. Exports rose 15.6% year-on-year in October, accelerating
from September. Exports to the U.S. rose 13%, though demand was broadly
strong --- particularly in Asia. Rather than trade, most of the slowdown
seems tied to the government's ongoing efforts to rein in "nonstandard
financing activities," including credit issued outside formal bank
loans. While containing these financing activities helps promote
financial stability, regulatory officials have noticed many private
firms faced diminished access to funding, which slowed their growth.
Policymakers have already deployed targeted stimulus to offset the
slight drag, and they recently announced a slate of reforms to offer
further assistance. Now, many fear that the strong trade growth was the
result of companies front-running the tariffs --- which means delayed
pain is on the way. Even if that's true, I doubt it leaves a mark. To
see why, scale Trump's tariffs --- and the global retaliation to them.
To date, [Trump has taxed about half of U.S. imports from China at rates
ranging from 10% to 25%. But he's threatened more, **so let's
overestimate.** In 2017, the U.S. imported 3.51 trillion yuan (\$517
billion) in goods from China. If Trump taxed them all at a flat 25%,
tariff payments would be 877.5 billion yuan. Seems big! But nominal
Chinese GDP was 82.7 trillion yuan in 2017]{.underline}. If the economy
matches the government's 2018 target and grows 6.5% --- plus another
2.5% for inflation --- GDP would grow by 7.4 trillion yuan this year.
That means [our inflated estimate of tariff payments amounts to **just
1.1% of Chinese GDP** and 11.9% of expected growth. Small! Even if we
presume tariffs erase all 877.5 billion yuan in value, Chinese GDP would
still grow by over 6.5 trillion yuan in 2018. So, all else equal,
instead of 9% nominal growth, you'd get 7.9%. **No
calamity.**]{.underline} Most nations would love to see nominal GDP grow
7.9%. [Tariffs shouldn't harm global growth enough to destroy other
countries' demand for Chinese exports]{.underline}, either. Including
America's, nations globally have recently enacted or threatened tariffs
on a total of 6.8 trillion yuan in goods. Using a 25% rate --- again, an
overestimate --- tariff payments would total 1.7 trillion yuan. The IMF
estimates world GDP was 589 trillion yuan in 2017. Tariff payments only
amount to 0.29% of that. **[You could triple or quadruple them without
triggering a global recession]{.underline}**. The IMF also estimates
3.7% nominal GDP growth this year --- adding about 21.8 trillion yuan.
Tariff payments are just 7.8% of growth.

[As trade talks between the U.S. and China increasingly center on
Chinese treatment of foreign companies, Beijing says major American
complaints about structural aspects of its economy are running up
against "core interests."]{.underline} The implication: **[Those matters
are not up for negotiation.]{.underline}** Previously, the vague "core
interest" term was generally understood as referring to Beijing's
territorial claims, such as those on Taiwan. But a commentary piece
published this weekend by state news agency Xinhua emphasized that China
will not yield on its prerogative about how to manage its economy. The
Chinese-language article published Saturday claimed there were five ways
in which the U.S. is harming the growth of the global economy by
launching a trade war with the Asian giant. ["At the negotiating table,
the U.S. government has made many arrogant requests, including
restricting the development of state-owned enterprises," the commentary
said, according to a CNBC translation. "Obviously, this is beyond the
field and scope of trade negotiations, (and) touches upon China's
fundamental economic system." "This demonstrates, that behind the trade
war the U.S. has launched against China, there is an attempt to violate
China's economic sovereignty, (and) compel China to damage its own core
interests," the article said. China's giant state-owned enterprises
control strategic industries such as energy, telecommunications and
defense. Since those companies benefit from favorable policies and
subsidies, foreign companies complain of an unfair advantage. The
escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China has focused the
coerced surrender of proprietary technology and the trampling of
intellectual property rights.]{.underline}

[On April 30, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He made an unusual request to his
American guests Robert Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, who were in
Beijing for crunch talks to end the costly trade war between the world's
two largest economies.]{.underline} Liu, President Xi Jinping's trusted
economic lieutenant, wanted to have a quiet word with the two American
senior officials in private. Three of them broke away from the rest of
the negotiation teams. Accompanied only by a Chinese interpreter, they
entered a small room at the meeting venue and stayed inside for nearly
an hour. [When they finally emerged, they did not give any briefings or
instructions to their aides. But their expressions were stern and
gloomy, according to a person who was present. A sense of foreboding
permeated the meeting hall, but nobody dared to ask why. Five days
later, the once hopeful trade negotiations took a sudden turn. American
President Donald Trump announced on Twitter on May 5 that the United
States would increase tariffs from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on US\$200
billion of Chinese goods. Chinese official media hit back at the
American announcement, saying that the additional tariffs would make it
even harder to strike an agreement. At a meeting on May 13, Xi canvassed
the other 24 Politburo members for their views on the latest American
demands. The Politburo overwhelmingly decided that the Americans had
gone too far and China should put its foot down, according to a source.
What exactly had caused this costly impasse in the trade talks and sent
global markets into a tailspin remained unclear. The US side accused
Beijing of "reneging" on its earlier promises.]{.underline} The
Americans painted a vivid picture of how the Chinese side had taken out
the most crucial agreements from a 130-page document that both sides had
"agreed" earlier. The document returned to Washington was reduced to
only 103 pages, according to American sources. [Beijing was livid at the
accusation, calling it "untruthful and deliberately confusing". Yet the
Chinese government never offered its side of the story to the
public.]{.underline} Two separate Chinese sources told the South China
Morning Post that the talks hit a snag because the US side "kept adding
new demands in the late stages of the negotiations". They said "some of
these would directly affect China's political and social stability".
Beijing was particularly angered by the additional tariffs and what it
saw as the US' attempt to shift the blame to China. ["The real reason is
that the US side keep changing their demands," one source said. "There
were so many changes that we can't \[keep giving in\]. And then they
turned around and accused us of backtracking."]{.underline} He also
revealed some of the key areas that the two sides could not agree on.
For instance, [Washington demanded China "completely open its internet"
and relax its controls that require foreign cloud computing companies to
store all their data in China. "China can only agree to selectively open
some areas. A completely open internet is impossible," the source
said]{.underline}. [Another contentious point was the quantity of
American products China must purchase annually. "The US wants China to
increase imports of American products by another US\$100 billion a
year," the source said. "It is difficult to achieve that
immediately."]{.underline} Given that Washington has kept in place an
extensive ban on hi-tech exports to China, there would be limited
choices of imports for Beijing besides agricultural products and
liquefied natural gas. [The two sides also could not agree on the issue
of currency manipulation]{.underline}. Although Beijing agrees to the
principle that it should not use currency depreciation to gain trade
advantages, it wants more flexibility and control to ensure the
stability of its financial system. The US, however, wanted a rigid
system that allowed little room for manoeuvre. The source did not
elaborate further. Most critically, the US negotiators demanded to have
a monitoring mechanism to track and verify progress, and wanted it to be
stipulated in the final agreement that the US could impose tariffs on
Chinese products if it was not satisfied with developments. Some Chinese
laws would also need to be rewritten to accommodate US demands. ["These
are unacceptable to the Chinese side," the source said, adding that **a
core issue was the US' lack of trust in Beijing.**]{.underline} "To have
a deal, both sides need to be able to see things from the other side's
perspective," the source said. "The Americans need to understand that it
will take time for China to implement these changes. If they refuse to
accept that and demand instant changes, then there is no way that we can
continue."

[President Donald Trump's administration told China it has a month to
seal a trade deal or face tariffs on all its exports to the U.S., even
as both sides sought to avoid a public breakdown in negotiations despite
a developing stalemate. The threat was made during talks Friday in
Washington, hours after Trump upped the ante by imposing a second round
of punitive duties on \$200 billion in Chinese goods.]{.underline} The
talks are under close scrutiny across global financial markets, and U.S.
stocks turned positive after negotiators on both sides said the session
had gone fairly well. In a series of tweets that cheered markets, Trump
declared Friday that the talks with China had been "candid and
constructive." "The relationship between President Xi and myself remains
a very strong one, and conversations into the future will continue," he
said. Further talks are possible, but there's no immediate plan for the
next round, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.
Earlier, in a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. officials
laid out their bottom line, telling him that Beijing had three or four
weeks to agree to a deal or face additional 25% tariffs on a further
\$325 billion in exports to the U.S., according to people familiar with
the talks. The threat came in response to the lack of any meaningful
concessions by China during two days of meetings, the people said. In a
statement late Friday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said
the administration would release details of its plans for tariffs on
roughly \$300 billion in imports from China on Monday, setting the
process in motion for Trump to deliver on his latest threat. [The lack
of progress left major question-marks hanging over the search for a deal
on trade \-- just one source of tensions in a growing geopolitical
rivalry that's already shifting supply chains and testing established
economic and security alliances.]{.underline} In an interview Friday
with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, Liu said both sides agreed to keep
talking despite what he called "some temporary resistance and
distractions,'' and to hold future meetings in Beijing. He dismissed the
idea that talks had broken down. "It's normal to have hiccups during the
negotiations. It's inevitable." 'Equality and Dignity' He also struck a
note of defiance. "For the interest of the people of China, the people
of U.S. and the the people of the whole world, we will deal with this
rationally,' the vice premier said. "But China is not afraid, nor are
the Chinese people," adding that "China needs a cooperative agreement
with equality and dignity." [Chinese state media released a statement of
the official view of fault-lines in the talks. In a commentary published
Saturday, Xinhua news agency said the two sides differ on whether or not
all tariffs should be removed as part of an agreement. The second
sticking point is on the amount of purchases China should make in order
to even the trade balance. The third is on the "balance" of the text \--
Chinese commentators have long signaled that they see the agreement as
being one sided and damaging to Chinese sovereignty.]{.underline} In a
series of morning tweets Trump, who is seeking re-election on the back
of a booming U.S. economy, sought to justify his decision to hike
tariffs as well as to convince businesses and financial markets that he
wasn't walking away from a deal.

### 2NC Economy Defense

**Decline doesn't cause war**

Christina L. **Davis &** Krzysztof J. **Pelc 17**, Christina L. Davis is
a Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton;
Krzysztof J. Pelc is an Associate Professor of Political Science at
McGill University, "Cooperation in Hard Times: Self-restraint of Trade
Protection," Journal of Conflict Resolution, 61(2): 398-429

[Conclusion Political economy theory would lead us to expect rising
trade protection during hard times]{.underline}. [Yet **empirical
evidence**]{.underline} on this count [has been mixed]{.underline}. Some
studies find a correlation between poor macroeconomic conditions and
protection, but the worst recession since the Great Depression has
generated surprisingly moderate levels of protection. We explain this
apparent contradiction. [Our statistical findings show that under
conditions of pervasive economic crisis]{.underline} at the
international level, [states exercise more **restraint**]{.underline}
than they would when facing crisis alone. [These results throw light on
behavior not only during the crisis, but throughout the WTO
period]{.underline}, from 1995 to the present. One concern may be that
the restraint we observe during widespread crises is actually the result
of a decrease in aggregate demand and that domestic pressure for import
relief is lessened by the decline of world trade. [By **controlling**
for **product-level imports**, we show that the restraint on remedy use
is not a byproduct of declining imports]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}
**[also]{.underline}** [take into account the ability of]{.underline}
some [countries to **manipulate their currency** and demonstrate that
the relationship between crisis and trade protection **holds**
independent of exchange rate policies]{.underline}. Government
[decisions to impose costs on their trade partners by taking advantage
of their legal right to use flexibility measures]{.underline} are driven
not only by the domestic situation but also by circumstances abroad.
This [can give rise to an individual **incentive for strategic
self-restraint** toward trade partners in similar economic
trouble]{.underline}. Under conditions of widespread crisis, [government
leaders **fear** the **repercussions** that their own use of trade
protection may have on the behavior of trade partners at a time when
they cannot afford the economic cost of a trade war]{.underline}.
[Institutions provide **monitoring** and a venue for **leader
interaction** that **facilitates coordination** among
states]{.underline}. Here the key function is [to reinforce expectations
that any move to protect industries will trigger similar moves in other
countries]{.underline}. Such coordination often draws on shared
historical analogies, such as the Smoot--Hawley lesson, which form a
focal point to shape beliefs about appropriate state behavior. Much of
the literature has focused on the more visible action of legal
enforcement through dispute settlement, but this only captures part of
the story. Our research suggests that [tools of informal governance such
as leader pledges, guidance from the Director General, trade policy
reviews, and plenary meetings **play a real role** within the trade
regime]{.underline}. In the absence of sufficiently stringent rules over
flexibility measures, compliance alone is insufficient during a global
economic crisis. [These **circumstances** trigger **informal
mechanisms** that complement legal rules to **support
cooperation**]{.underline}. [During widespread crisis, legal enforcement
would be inadequate, and informal governance helps to bolster the
system]{.underline}. Informal coordination is by nature difficult to
observe, and we are unable to directly measure this process. Instead, we
examine the variation in responses across crises of varying severity,
within the context of the same formal setting of the WTO. Yet by
focusing on discretionary tools of protection---trade remedies and
tariff hikes within the bound rate---we can offer conclusions about how
systemic crises shape country restraint independent of formal
institutional constraints. Insofar as [institutions are
generating]{.underline} such [restraint]{.underline}, we offer that it
is [by facilitating informal coordination]{.underline}, since all these
instruments of trade protection fall within the letter of the law.
Future research should explore trade policy at the micro level to
identify which pathway is the most important for coordination. Research
at a more macro-historical scope could compare how countries respond to
crises under fundamentally different institutional contexts. In sum, the
determinants of protection include economic downturns not only at home
but also abroad. [Rather than reinforcing pressure for protection,
pervasive crisis in the global economy is shown to generate
countervailing pressure for restraint in response to domestic
crisis]{.underline}. In some cases, **[hard times bring more, not less,
international cooperation]{.underline}**.

#### Substitution and re-routing solve their internal links---investors will [take advantage]{.underline} of the selloff and growth will last

[All this also presumes these tariffs are paid in full. Unlikely.
Bilateral tariffs like these encourage substitution and re-routing ---
tariff dodging]{.underline}. For example, consider China's retaliatory
tariff on U.S. soybeans. Chinese soybean imports from America fell by
80% year-on-year in September. Ouch! But [Chinese consumers and
businesses didn't just stop using imported soybeans. They substituted,
buying beans from Brazil, the world's second-largest grower, instead.
China's shift depressed U.S. soybean prices, causing temporary pain. But
with time, **brokers will likely see these lower prices** --- and swoop
in. They'll buy up beans on the cheap and ship to a third
party]{.underline}. While the scale hasn't replaced Chinese demand yet,
[new partners are emerging for these American beans. Ironically, Brazil
is among them! They buy cheaper American beans and either re-export them
or sell them domestically. This could easily be behind the uptick in
Asian demand for Chinese exports, too. Hence, **even the very small
impact the tariffs would have if paid in full won't
happen**]{.underline}. Finally, tariffs are just a tax. A tax on trade
isn't any worse than most other taxes. Countries raise other taxes
often! Yet few fear them causing global bear markets. Nor should they
--- tax revenue gets redistributed, not deleted. Hence big tax increases
create debate --- not doom. The small scope and easily dodged nature of
tariffs highlights a reality: Viewing Trump's moves as economic policy
is a mistake. This isn't about trade deficits. It's not about jobs,
either. Nor is it a rejection of globalization. If it was, tariff rates
would be far higher. Like most American political policy debates, think
of this in terms of the next election --- now 2020's presidential race,
when Trump seeks re-election. Key to Trump's 2016's victory: motivating
voters in America's industrial Midwest who have long been skeptical of
trade. He told them America had been treated unfairly by trade partners.
Not just China! He took shots at the EU, Japan, Mexico and Canada. Trump
will need those voters again in two years --- and he knows it. China
knows it, too, which is perhaps why China's retaliatory tariffs targeted
industries in states Trump will need to win to secure re-election in
2020. Don't be shocked if a relatively minor U.S.-China handshake ends
this whole saga, with both sides able to claim victory. For stocks, fear
of a false factor is always bullish. [When investors realize the "trade
war" that terrified them is less than feared, **relief should wash over
markets**. **Particularly the areas investors sold most heavily out of
fear**]{.underline}. That means China. Specifically it means materials
and industrial firms --- hardest hit in the tariff terror. While China
is indeed shifting from heavy industry to services and consumption, as
the head of Polish copper miner KGHM Polska Miedz SA recently told the
media, "[There is a lot of support for Chinese growth coming from the
One Belt One Road initiative and infrastructural investments in the
mid-western part of China." That reality, paired with the selloff, is a
bullish disconnect. A **buy signal**]{.underline}. Technology, too, has
been hard hit, giving you a chance to buy fast-growing firms at a
discount. However, domestically focused industries like financials and
utilities fell much less than others. They should bounce too, but less
than those harder hit. Legendary American investor Warren Buffett once
famously said, "Be greedy when others are fearful." There is sense in
that for equity investors --- and it applies to Chinese stocks now. But
I think a slight tweak makes sense too: Be greedy where others are most
fearful.

Saturday\'s meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at
the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In the latest tariff moves,
the U.S. levied 10 percent duties on \$200 billion worth of goods from
China, prompting Beijing to put tariffs on \$60 billion worth of U.S.
goods. \"I think that [trade deals themselves really are **overstated**

### 1NC Arms Sales Not Key

**Arms sales to Taiwan aren't key to US-China relations**

**Lingwall 2015** (Noah, student at the Schreyer Honors College of the
Pennsylvania State University and an intern at the Strategic Studies
Institute of the U.S. Army War College, \"The Taiwan Problem: If It
Ain\'t Broke, Don\'t Fix It,\"
<http://thediplomat.com/2015/08/the-taiwan-problem-if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it/>
8/8/2015)

Myth #1: Taiwan Is an Obstacle to Better U.S.-China Relations [Glaser
and others]{.underline} who espouse the benefits of a U.S.-China grand
bargain [allege that the unresolved question of Taiwanese independence
has impeded healthy U.S.-China relations]{.underline}. To test this
assertion, it is important to consider the reality of recent
China-Taiwan interactions. The issues of Taiwan's disputed status and
U[.S. arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline} remain perhaps the most
outstanding problems between the United States and China. Still, even
these issues **[no longer impede U.S.-China relations]{.underline}**.
The question of Taiwanese independence emerged in the 1990s with the
nation's transition to democracy. As the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) gained control over Taiwan in subsequent
elections, then-President Chen Shui-bian amplified Taiwan's calls for
independence. The 2005 passage of the Anti-Secession Law\* in China
served as a sharp response to Taiwan's ambitions for independence.
Meanwhile, former President George W. Bush clarified the U.S. position
of "strategic ambiguity" over the Taiwan issue with a powerful
proclamation: The United States would not want to see Taiwan provoke
China, but the United States would help defend Taiwan if China were to
lose its patience with Taiwan and use force to achieve unification with
the island. This statement made it clear that the United States did not
support either formal Taiwanese independence or forceful unification.
This policy position effectively stabilized the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait. Since then, no further attempts have been made to upend the
balance between China and Taiwan. Nor should U.S. arms sales to Taiwan
be regarded as a serious barrier to U.S.-China relations. [The Taiwan
Relations Act of 1979 stipulates that the United States will provide
Taiwan with arms of a defense nature. Although China often uses the
United States' periodic decision to sell arms to Taiwan as a political
ploy]{.underline} to suspend the Chinese military's contact with the
United States and stir up nationalistic sentiments, [the issue needs to
be put into perspective.]{.underline} While all arms are technically
offensive in nature, the quantity and quality of the weapons Taiwan
receives from the United States do little Taiwan's offensive
capabilities. For example, Taiwan purchases short-range fighter jets,
air defense systems, and older-generation weapons. In addition, U.S.
authorization to sell arms to Taiwan differs from the actual delivery of
weapon systems. [The United States has declined to provide the quality
of weapons that Taiwan has requested from time to time]{.underline}.
Moreover, Taiwan's legislature has often failed to appropriate the funds
necessary to purchase the quantity of weapons requested. Finally,
[China's periodic suspensions of its military contacts with the United
States have **failed to inflict significant damage** on U.S.-China
relations and **relations are regularly quietly restored** once the
political storm subsides]{.underline}. Beijing understands that Taiwan's
weaponry does not pose a serious threat to mainland China's military.
Bearing this in mind, it seems evident that [U.S. arms sales to Taiwan
act as mere political pretense for China's antagonistic behavior and
**are not serious obstacles**]{.underline}. In fact, the past several
decades have produced a relatively stable economic and political
equilibrium between China and Taiwan. Most recently, the 2008 election
of President Ma Ying-jeou has ushered in an era of unprecedented
China-Taiwan cooperation. Economic integration, highlighted by a 2010
bilateral trade agreement, has inextricably linked Beijing and Taipei.
In fact, the health of Taiwan's economy relies on revenue from Chinese
trade. According to 2014 Chinese statistics, trade volume between the
two nations totaled more than 200 billion dollars. Taiwan also exports
most of its goods to China and enjoys a huge trade surplus. Yearly
trends indicate that the economic bonds between the two nations are
getting even stronger: From 2014 to 2015, trade between the two nations
increased 16.7 per cent.

### 1NC Turn 

**Abandoning Taiwan doesn't solve US-China relations -- structural
factors preclude cooperation AND reduced presence emboldens Chinese

Budgetary Assessments, 2/28, \"Why Taiwan Matters,\"

[Abandoning Taiwan would]{.underline} likely **[fail to ameliorate the
Sino-U.S. Relationship]{.underline}**. [There are certain core issues
troubling the Sino-U.S. relationship that extend far beyond the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}. Whether it is [Beijing's assertiveness towards its
neighbors]{.underline} \[10\], some of whom, like Japan and the
Philippines, are treaty allies of the United States, o[r issues related
to cyber-espionage and human rights, the challenges currently testing
the bilateral relationship **are profound and numerous.**]{.underline}
[China is a \[11\]revisionist power]{.underline} \[11\]---and [its
claims on the international system do not end with Taiwan]{.underline}.
**[One should not surmise]{.underline}**, therefore, **[that Sino-U.S.
strategic competition would abate were the Taiwan issue to be
resolved]{.underline}**. Indeed, a growing body of work in the strategic
studies community has suggested that [Sino-U.S. tensions are more
structural than conjectural]{.underline}, and are the natural result of
the \[12\]friction \[12\] that traditionally occurs between rising and
established powers. Furthermore, while some may assume that China's
absorption of Taiwan might provide at least a symbolic first step
towards a more stable and peaceful relationship between Washington and
Beijing, this hypothesis also appears somewhat untenable. To the
contrary, [an American abandonment of Taiwan might only succeed in
**emboldening, and strengthening hardline elements** within Beijing's
leadership, by providing a material confirmation of their long-held
desire to see America progressively retreat]{.underline} from the
Indo-Pacific theater. Bonnie Glaser and Nancy Bernkopf Tucker have
\[13\]expressed their concerns \[13\] over such a development,
cautioning that [A decision to jettison Taiwan, or even cut back
significantly on U.S. support, would prove to an increasingly confident
China that Washington has become **weak, vacillating and
unreliable**]{.underline}...Accordingly, a U.S. sacrifice of Taiwan,
while gratifying, could not thoroughly slake a continuing need for
Beijing to demonstrate its power. Indeed, the sacrifice might promote
new appetites and necessitate fresh efforts to satisfy that need.

### 2NC/1NR Arms Sales Not Key

**Reducing security assistance to Taiwan doesn't solve US-China
relations -- it's not a magic-bullet solution**

Maintaining constructive relationships with both Beijing and Taipei is a
perpetual challenge for American leaders. With the end of the Cold War
and the rise of a strong, globally engaged China, [some American policy
analysts have begun to question whether the delicately balanced Taiwan
policy the United States has followed]{.underline} since the late 1970s
[still serves US interests]{.underline}. According to these observers,
US defense assistance prevents Taipei from making hard decisions about
its future and undermines a much more important relationship---the one
between the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC).
Therefore, [they argue, the United States needs to phase out that aid
and let Taiwan and China work through their relationship without US
interference]{.underline}. **[These arguments promise a magic-bullet
solution to one of the most intractable problems in US foreign
relations]{.underline}**, so it is not surprising that they have
received a lot of attention. As persuasive it may be on its face, [the
case for rethinking US Taiwan policy and, more specifically, withdrawing
American security assistance**, is overstated.**]{.underline} [Such a
policy change would not serve the interests of the United States,
Taiwan, or China; nor would it solve the problems its proponents claim
they want to address]{.underline}. Key points in this Outlook: • In the
face of a rising China, US analysts are increasingly calling on
Washington to rethink its Taiwan policy, but withdrawing US support
would serve neither China, Taiwan, nor the United States. • Phasing out
US security assistance to Taiwan would not only undermine vital security
architecture in the Asia-Pacific region but also send a chilling message
to our democratic allies around the world that American friendship is
fickle. • [Instead of satisfying Beijing, a change in US Taiwan policy
could raise China's expectations]{.underline} without making peaceful
cross-strait unification any easier, **[further damaging US-China
relations]{.underline}**.

**Reduced support for Taiwan doesn't solve US-China relations -- other
issues remain**

**Bush 2013** (Richard, Director, Center for East Asia Policy Studies +
Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy, John L. Thornton China Center @
Brookings, 1/14, \"Uncharted Strait,\"
http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/01/14-taiwan-bush)

[A few influential Americans have begun to suggest that the United
States should reduce its long-standing security commitment to
Taiwan]{.underline}. Some say that Taiwan itself has chosen to improve
relations with China, so the island has less need for advanced U.S.
weaponry and a defense pledge. Others argue that Washington, to avoid
unnecessary tensions with a rising China, should accommodate Beijing on
the most neuralgic issue---Taiwan. The first group overstates the limits
of the ongoing Taiwan-China détente. True, progress has been made in
normalizing, liberalizing, and institutionalizing the economic
relationship. But, to the disappointment of many Chinese, none has
occurred on political and security issues, because the Taiwan public is
not ready to go there and serious conceptual differences exist on how to
get there anyway. So the prospects for cross-Strait relations in the
near-term are for modest, incremental progress only, or a stall. [The
second group misunderstands the benefits and costs of a significant
American accommodation to China regarding Taiwan (e.g. by sharply
cutting back arms sales). In fact, Washington has frictions with China
on a growing list of issues]{.underline}. **[Conceding to Beijing on
Taiwan will not help us elsewhere]{.underline}**. Moreover, our friends
and allies (e.g. Japan and Korea) will worry that the United States
might sacrifice their interests next for the sake of good relations with
China. Finally, the primary reason China has failed to incorporate
Taiwan on its terms is not U.S. arms sales but because its negotiating
position is unacceptable to the Taiwan public.

### 2NC/1NR Turn 

**Ending US defense assistance to Taiwan sparks US political fights that
poison US-China cooperation**

**Rigger 2011** (Shelley, Brown Professor and chair of political science
at Davidson College, 11/29, \"Why giving up Taiwan will not help us with
China,\"
https://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/)

**[No Silver Bullet for US-China Woes]{.underline}** Even if it were
true that Sino-American tensions could be melted away with a single
policy change in Washington, the United States should still continue to
support Taiwan to maintain the credibility of its alliances and uphold
its commitment to democracy as a desirable and feasible goal for
developing nations. But, in reality, [ending US defense assistance to
Taipei is **unlikely to produce the salutary effects** the critics of
current US policy anticipate]{.underline}. Such a change would indeed
delight Beijing; however, it would create new problems just as
intractable as the old ones but less familiar and potentially even more
challenging. [The point of departure for critics of America's existing
Taiwan policy is their shared belief that ending security assistance to
Taiwan would improve US-China relations]{.underline}. As Freeman puts
it, "The kind of long-term relationship of friendship and cooperation
China and America want with each other is incompatible with our
emotionally fraught differences over the Taiwan issue. These differences
propel mutual hostility and the sort of ruinous military rivalry between
the two countries that has already begun. We are coming to a point at
which we can no longer finesse our differences over Taiwan. We must
either resolve them or live with the increasingly adverse consequences
of our failure to do so."\[10\] As a syllogism, this argument makes
sense: Beijing believes Taiwan should be unified with the mainland, and
it views US security assistance to Taiwan as the primary reason it is
not. Because unification is a core issue for the PRC, leaders in Beijing
cannot ignore or overlook US intervention; they must constantly
challenge it. Thus, if the United States ended its security assistance
to Taiwan, the biggest irritant in US-China relations would disappear.
[In practice, unfortunately, **there is no guarantee** that a change in
US policy toward Taiwan would instantly or automatically end, or even
significantly reduce, the tensions the Taiwan issue creates in
Sino-American relations]{.underline}. [Ending security assistance to
Taiwan would raise expectations in China without removing the existing
obstacles to peaceful unification. It likely would provoke panic in
Taiwan, but it would not make the Taiwanese people any more enthusiastic
about unification]{.underline}. On the contrary, the more vulnerable and
threatened the Taiwanese people felt, the harder it would be for them to
consider China's overtures rationally. For decades, the United States
has justified arms sales to Taiwan on the grounds that Taipei can
negotiate with Beijing more effectively from a position of strength than
of weakness. It is easy to dismiss this logic as a rationalization, but
as Randall Schriver said, "In what other instance involving a
negotiation is the weaker party better off? . . . Historically, what you
find is where there is equal power---or, at least, credible deterrent
power---you get better outcomes." Neither Beijing nor Taipei is well
served by a negotiating process that leads to a bad deal, including one
Taiwanese citizens cannot accept. Successfully pressuring Taiwan's
negotiators into accepting a deal might seem like a victory for Beijing,
but if Taiwan's domestic politics make it impossible to implement the
deal, the long-term result might be worse than no deal at all. [Ending
US defense assistance to Taiwan]{.underline}---whether by repealing the
Taiwan Relations Act or by simply declining to provide defensive
equipment to Taiwan's armed forces---[would not "ripen" Taiwan for
peaceful unification or obviate the rationale the United States has
historically followed regarding Taiwan]{.underline}. [It would, however,
intensify the debate over Taiwan policy within the United
States]{.underline}. Taiwan still has many US friends and supporters,
and many foreign policy experts would question a decision to change
course. The policy changes Gilley, Glaser, Freeman, and Owens recommend
would stimulate a debate over China policy at a time when negative
attitudes toward the PRC already are on the rise. **[The last thing
Sino-American relations need is an acrimonious, politically charged
debate in Washington over policy toward China and Taiwan]{.underline}**.
In sum, **[changing America's Taiwan policy could easily induce a
poisonous turn in the domestic politics of US China
policy]{.underline}** without making peaceful unification easier.

**Abandoning Taiwan doesn't solve US-China relations -- only emboldens
China to seek regional hegemony**

**Roy 2015** (Denny, 6/24, Senior Fellow @ CSIS East-West Center, \"The
Impossible Price of a U.S.-China Grand Bargain: Dumping Taiwan,\"
http://nationalinterest.org/print/blog/the-buzz/the-impossible-price-us-china-grand-bargain-dumping-taiwan-13177)

[He assumes that the US abandonment of Taiwan would "dramatically
improve" U.S.-China relations]{.underline}, and that "China can be very
secure with the United States maintaining its alliances and forward
deployment" as long as Taiwan is no longer in play. T[his is believable
only if we posit that Beijing has no aspirations for regional leadership
or revisions of the current order beyond gaining control over Taiwan,
both now and in the future]{.underline}. The "grand bargain" idea
probably resonates less with Beijing than Washington. From Beijing's
point of view, this would be asking it to trade something it believes it
already owns for something else it believes it already owns. If they did
agree, how the "bargain" would be operationalized is unclear. [What
would it mean for China to "officially accept" U.S. alliances and
military bases in the Asia-Pacific? This would seem to require Beijing
to renounce its proudly "principled" opposition to any country having
"Cold War era" alliances and foreign bases]{.underline}. At the same
time, it is easy to foresee China continuing its pre-bargain activities
(military buildup, maneuvers with Russia, naval patrols in the East and
South China Sea, etc.) while claiming these were not attempts to drive
U.S. influence out of the region. Glaser recognizes that Chinese leaders
may intend to push out their U.S. rival. He argues his proposal would
answer the question of whether this is Beijing's plan. If Beijing
accepts the proposal, it would indicate that China has limited aims and
can tolerate continued U.S. regional hegemony. If not, China intends to
usurp that role from the United States. [If we now recognize that
expelling U.S. strategic leadership may be Beijing's intention,
unilaterally assisting the Chinese by abandoning Taiwan is not the most
sensible policy if the US hopes to retain its accustomed
role]{.underline}. [The timing of Glaser's proposal is particularly bad
given that Xi Jinping's government seems to represent a shift toward a
more assertive Chinese foreign policy that has grown impatient with
waiting for the United States to decline]{.underline} on its own. [Even
if the current regime in Beijing does not plan to dismantle U.S.
regional leadership, the United States cannot be sure the leaders of a
future, stronger China will think the same way.]{.underline} China could
renege on Glaser's proposed deal more easily than the US could. China is
a local power with relatively short supply lines to the East and South
China Seas. In the case of the South China Sea, China enjoys a huge and
growing military force projection disparity in its favor relative to the
other claimants. But to cancel its part of the deal, the United States
would have to cross the Pacific Ocean to invade and capture a Taiwan
defended by ensconced PLA forces only 100 miles from China's mainland.
Ultimately, [Glaser's idea founders on the contradiction between
assuring China and assuring allies who fear China.]{.underline}
Admitting that regional confidence in U.S. reliability would suffer if
Washington stopped supporting Taiwan, Glaser argues that Washington
would need to compensate for this reputational setback by increasing
U.S. military forces in the region, investing in stronger capabilities,
and deepening ties between US and allied military commands. These
compensatory moves, however, would go a long way toward reviving the
very fears that the "grand bargain" was intended to alleviate. It is
questionable that China would feel much more secure if the price of
gaining control over Taiwan was a permanently stronger US military
presence in the region. Glaser's view of the protection of a democratic
Taiwan as superfluous rather than intrinsic to America's "longstanding
military security role in East Asia" is erroneous. Therefore [a
bargaining away of US support for Taiwan -- especially for a doubtful
payoff -- is **no way to strengthen America's regional
leadership.**]{.underline}

[Taiwan's national security is **fundamentally in the national interest
of the United States**]{.underline}, and the U.S. seeks to create an
atmosphere conducive to a peaceful and non-coercive resolution of
political differences on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. [U.S. arms
sales]{.underline} are intended to [provide Taiwan's government and
leadership with the confidence needed to engage with their counterparts
in Beijing from a position of strength]{.underline}. Guided by the
Taiwan Relations Act, and consistent with understandings outlined in
Joint Communiqués with China, America providing to Taiwan the arms
necessary to ensure its own self-defense has enabled democracy to
flourish on the island. Substantial support for Taiwan has also served
as a visible reminder of U.S. commitments to peace and security in the
Asia Pacific. The process by which U.S. policymakers have addressed
Taiwan's defense requirements has evolved over time. When the Mutual
Defense Treaty guided the relationship, between 1955 and 1979, Taiwan
was treated as an ally. After the shift in diplomatic relations in 1979,
Taiwan was treated as a special case. Concerned over possible Chinese
intervention, Taiwan defense officials traveled to Washington to present
senior U.S. policy officials with Taiwan's bundled list of requirements
in annual face-to-face meetings. Formal Congressional notifications of
approved items were forwarded both relatively frequently and as needed
throughout the course of a given year. In 2001, the annual Taiwan arms
sales talks process was discontinued, with the intention of allowing
Taiwan's defense requirements to be addressed at any time during the
year, similar to the process for a normal security assistance partner.
Since 2008, however, Congressional notifications of approved items have
consistently been bundled into large multi-billion dollar packages,
rather than being processed when ready. A return to the annual arms
sales talks process may warrant consideration. [China has a
well-established track record of responding negatively and stridently to
public announcements of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}.
Congressional notifications will likely remain the primary trigger for
Chinese responses, rather than earlier decision-points in the process
such as providing Price and Availability (P&A) data in response to a
Letter of Request (LOR) from Taiwan. Future Chinese actions taken in
response to Taiwan arms sales may include sanctions against the U.S.
companies that are supporting Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs or
undertaking Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) programs with Taiwan. However,
the effectiveness of such sanctions is open to question, as major U.S.
defense industrial firms conduct only minor business in China. Beijing
is also unlikely to sanction smaller sub-system suppliers due to their
peripheral involvement as sub-contractors and their marginal value as
symbolic targets. In addition, if a U.S. company were to face
discrimination as a result of Chinese sanctions due to Taiwan arms
sales, a case could be introduced to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
for adjudication. Beijing authorities could suspend People's Liberation
Army (PLA) military exchanges with the U.S. Department of Defense in
response to Taiwan arms sales -- an often-used tactic. While such
exchanges have value, critical issues in the bilateral security
relationship would be addressed through other channels if necessary. In
addition, the PLA most likely would resume exchanges again, following an
appropriate interval, as they have in the past. In retaliation for
Taiwan arms sales, [PRC leaders could also consider releasing sensitive
nuclear or missilerelated technologies to Iran or other countries of
concern]{.underline}, or they could withhold support for
nonproliferation- related actions within the United Nations or other
international organizations. **[However, reprisals from the U.S. or from
other concerned countries could be expected in return, and Beijing
likely would also be subject to criticism from other players in Europe
and elsewhere who have significant interests in preventing Iran from
gaining weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}**. Political or
military leaders in [Beijing may attempt to retaliate by liquidating
U.S. Treasury holdings]{.underline}. As satisfying an emotional outburst
as this course of action might be on an individual basis, the PLA has
limited authority over national Chinese economic and financial policy. A
sudden sell-off of U.S. Treasury holdings would be a significant
horizontal and vertical escalation of the relatively minor, albeit
emotionally charged, issue of Taiwan arms sales. In addition, [**the
effects of such an action are unclear and could actually have a greater
negative effect on China's economic interests** than on the interests of
the U.S. Past behavior indicates that **China is unlikely to challenge
any fundamental U.S. interests in response to any future releases of
significant military articles or services to Taiwan**. The U.S.
therefore retains considerable freedom of action in abiding by the
Taiwan Relations Act.]{.underline} Barring a substantive reduction in
the Chinese military posture opposite Taiwan, the U.S. will likely
continue to provide Taiwan with weapons of a defensive character for the
foreseeable future. Nevertheless, key unresolved issues include Taiwan's
unheeded request for additional F-16 fighters, and the fact that the
Bush administration's 2001 commitment to assist Taiwan in its
acquisition of diesel-electric submarines remains unfulfilled. Taiwan's
request for additional F-16s is both reasonable and urgent, and should
be honored. In addition, if Congressional notification for a submarine
design program is not forthcoming, Taiwan's LOR should be withdrawn and
export licenses through direct commercial sales channels should be given
positive treatment. The Barack Obama administration has demonstrated
unnecessary restraint in its Taiwan arms sales decisions to date,
despite having ample justification for positive considerations.
[Excessive caution on new]{.underline} [arms sales to Taiwan risks
legitimizing PRC use of military coercion to resolve political
differences with its neighbors and]{.underline} **[sends a signal to
others in the region of a diminished U.S. commitment in
Asia.]{.underline}**

[China is seeking a bigger role in the Middle East arms trade, with a
major state-owned shipbuilder opening an office there and exporters
showing hi-tech weapons -- including an advanced killer robot ship -- at
a regional defence expo last week. Military analysts say the move means
China will be tailor-making more weapons for the Middle East, where the
market has been growing because of widespread conflict.]{.underline}
China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) on Wednesday announced it
had set up a representative office in Dubai to expand sales across the
Gulf region. The company, which developed and built China's first
home-grown aircraft carrier, said the office was its first overseas and
would focus on pursuing both military and civilian business
opportunities. One of the world's biggest arms markets, the Middle East
accounted for 32 per cent of global weapons imports in the 2013-17
period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. The region's arms imports grew by 103 per cent from the
2008-12 period to 2013-17 because most states were directly involved in
violent conflict, the institute said. [Meanwhile, China's arms exports
to the Middle East jumped 38 per cent in the 2013-17 period from the
previous five years, and it is now the fifth-largest arms exporter in
the world, supplying weapons to 48 countries.]{.underline} Pakistan is
the main buyer of Chinese weapons, but Middle Eastern nations are also
looking to China. Since 2014, China has sold more than 30 CH-4 drones to
countries such as Saudi Arabia, though its arms exports to the kingdom
in 2017 totalled about US\$20 million -- compared to US\$3.4 billion
from the United States. China has also sold its Wing Loong II drone to
the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar has bought its ballistic missiles.
In addition to setting up a branch in Dubai, CSIC also had its unmanned
20-tonne Aegis-class destroyer on display at the International Defence
Exhibition and Conference in Abu Dhabi, which wrapped up on Thursday.
Dubbed the "mini Aegis" because it has an electronic system said to be
as advanced as America's Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the JARI USV is
a 15-metre vessel with a top speed of 42 knots and a range of 500
nautical miles. Developed by CSIC's 716 Research Institute, it can be
armed with a 30mm cannon combined with small surface-to-air missiles,
anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and lightweight anti-submarine
torpedoes. It can also track underwater targets 7km away. Beijing-based
military analyst Zhou Chenming said the Chinese navy did not need the
mini Aegis and CSIC was building the vessel -- which could be used for
the Gulf region's narrow waterway -- for overseas markets. "This
reflects the fact that China's defence technology is advancing ... that
it can assemble a product based on the specific needs of customers," he
said. "China is improving its radar technology and can make smaller
active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar for the vessel." Also
on show in Abu Dhabi was China North Industries Group's new VT4 heavy
infantry fighting vehicle -- a third-generation main battle tank made
for export. Other Chinese weapons on display included the MRTV 3000
frigate and C-602 medium-range cruise missiles. [China's increased arms
sales to the Middle East have triggered concern from nations such as
Israel and the US. Israel is worried about its exports to Iran, while
the US has raised concerns about China's growing influence in the region
through the weapons trade and its projects under the "Belt and Road
Initiative".]{.underline} Last year, the Royal United Services Institute
said China was a significant supplier of military drones to Middle East
countries, especially those that are barred from importing them from the
US. Jonathan Fulton, an assistant professor of political science at
Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, said China's growing list of investments
and assets in the Gulf and its large expatriate population would require
some kind of military capacity to protect them.

The radio superhero The Shadow had the power to "cloud men's minds." But
nothing clouds men's minds like anything that has to do with Jews or
Israel. [This year's variation on that theme is the idea that Israel is
about to attack Iran.]{.underline} Such a claim repeatedly appears in
the media. Some have criticized Israel for attacking Iran and turning
the Middle East into a cauldron of turmoil (not as if the region needs
any help in that department) despite the fact that it hasn't even
happened. On the surface, of course, there is apparent evidence for such
a thesis. [Israel has talked about attacking Iran]{.underline} and one
can make a case for such an operation. [Yet any serious consideration of
this scenario --- based on **actual research and real analysis** rather
than what the uninformed assemble in their own heads or Israeli leaders
sending a message to create a situation where an attack isn't necessary
--- is this: It isn't going to happen]{.underline}. Indeed, [the main
leak from the Israeli government, by an ex-intelligence official who
hates]{.underline} Prime Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu]{.underline}, [has
been that the Israeli government **already decided not to attack**
Iran]{.underline}. He says that he worries this might change in the
future but there's no hint that this has happened or will happen.
Defense Minister Ehud [Barak has publicly denied plans for an imminent
attack as have other senior government officials.]{.underline} Of
course, one might joke that the fact that Israeli leaders talk about
attacking Iran is the biggest proof that they aren't about to do it. But
Israel, like other countries, should be subject to rational analysis.
Articles written by others are being spun as saying Israel is going to
attack when that's not what they are saying. I stand by my analysis and
before December 31 we will see who was right. I'm not at all worried
about stating very clearly that [Israel is not going to go to war with
Iran]{.underline}. So [why are Israelis talking about a potential attack
on Iran's nuclear facilities? Because that's a good way -- indeed, the
only way Israel has --- to **pressure Western countries** to work harder
on the issue]{.underline}, to increase sanctions and diplomatic efforts.
If one believes that somehow pushing Tehran into slowing down or
stopping its nuclear weapons drive is the only alternative to war, that
greatly concentrates policymakers' minds. Personally, I don't
participate --- consciously or as an instrument --- in disinformation
campaigns, even if they are for a good cause. Regarding Ronen Bergman's
article in the New York Times, I think [the answer is simple: Israeli
leaders are not announcing that they are about to attack Iran. They are
sending a message that the United States and Europe should act more
decisively so that Israel does not feel the need to attack Iran in the
future]{.underline}. That is a debate that can be held but it does not
deal with a different issue: [Is Israel about to attack Iran? **The
answer is "no."**]{.underline}

**And no impact to first strike**

**Bronner '12** (Ethan, NYT staff reporter, 1/26/12,
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/world/middleeast/israelis-see-irans-threats-of-retaliation-as-bluff.html?\_r=1&hp)

JERUSALEM --- [Israeli intelligence estimates, backed by academic
studies, have **cast doubt** on the widespread assumption that a
military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities would set off a
catastrophic set of events like a regional conflagration, widespread
acts of terrorism and sky-high oil prices.]{.underline} Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said he thinks Iranian citizens will welcome an
attack. The [estimates, which have been largely adopted by the country's
most senior officials, conclude that the threat of Iranian retaliation
is partly **bluff**. They are playing an important role in Israel's
calculation of whether ultimately to strike Iran, or to try to persuade
the United States to do so, even as Tehran faces tough new economic
sanctions from the West.]{.underline} "A war is no picnic," Defense
Minister Ehud Barak told Israel Radio in November. [But if Israel feels
itself forced into action, the retaliation would be
bearable]{.underline}, he said. ["There will not be 100,000 dead or
10,000 dead or **1,000 dead**. The state of Israel will not be
destroyed." The Iranian government,]{.underline} which says its nuclear
program is for civilian purposes, [has threatened to close the Strait of
Hormuz]{.underline} --- through which 90 percent of gulf oil passes ---
and if attacked, to retaliate with all its military might. But [Israeli
assessments reject the threats as **overblown**.]{.underline} Mr. Barak
and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have embraced those analyses as
they focus on how to stop what they view as Iran's determination to
obtain nuclear weapons. No issue in Israel is more fraught than the
debate over the wisdom and feasibility of a strike on Iran. [Some argue
that even a successful military strike would do no more than delay any
Iranian nuclear weapons program, and perhaps increase Iran's
determination to acquire the capability.]{.underline} Security officials
are increasingly kept from journalists or barred from discussing Iran.
[Much of the public talk is as much message delivery as actual
policy.]{.underline} With the region in turmoil and the Europeans having
agreed to harsh sanctions against Iran, strategic assessments can
quickly lose their currency. "They're like cartons of milk --- check the
sell-by date," one senior official said. But conversations with eight
current and recent top Israeli security officials suggested several
things: since Israel has been demanding the new sanctions, including an
oil embargo and seizure of Iran's Central Bank assets, it will give the
sanctions some months to work; the sanctions are viewed here as probably
insufficient; a military attack remains a very real option; and
postattack situations are considered less perilous than one in which
Iran has nuclear weapons. "Take every scenario of confrontation and
attack by Iran and its proxies and then ask yourself, 'How would it look
if they had a nuclear weapon?' " a senior official said. "In nearly
every scenario, the situation looks worse." The core analysis is based
on an examination of Iran's interests and abilities, along with recent
threats and conflicts. Before the United States-led war against Iraq in
1991, Saddam Hussein vowed that if attacked he would "burn half of
Israel." He fired about 40 Scud missiles at Israel, which did limited
damage. Similar fears of retaliation were voiced before the Iraq war in
2003 and in 2006, during Israel's war against Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon. In the latter, about 4,000 rockets were fired at Israel by
Hezbollah, most of them causing limited harm. "If you put all those
retaliations together and add in the terrorism of recent years, we are
probably facing some multiple of that," a retired official said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, citing an internal study. ["I'm
not saying Iran will not react. But it will be nothing like London
during World War II."]{.underline} A paper soon to be published by the
Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, written
by Amos Yadlin, former chief of military intelligence, and Yoel
Guzansky, who headed the Iran desk at Israel's National Security Council
until 2009, argues that the Iranian threat to close the Strait of Hormuz
is largely a bluff. The paper contends that, despite the risks of
Iranian provocation, [Iran **would not be able to close the waterway**
for any length of time and that it would not be in Iran's own interest
to do so.]{.underline} "[If others are closing the taps on you, why
close your own?"]{.underline} Mr. Guzansky said. [Sealing the strait
could also lead to all-out confrontation with the United States,
something]{.underline} the authors say they believe [Iran wants to
avoid.]{.underline} A separate paper just published by the Begin-Sadat
Center for Strategic Studies says that the [fear of **missile warfare**
against Israel **is exaggerated** since the missiles would be able to
inflict **only limited physical damage.**]{.underline} Most Israeli
analysts, like most officials and analysts abroad, reject these
arguments. They say that Iran has been preparing for an attack for some
years and will react robustly, as will its allies, Hezbollah and Hamas.
Moreover, they say, an attack will at best delay the Iranian program by
a couple of years and lead Tehran to redouble its efforts to build such
a weapon. But Mr. Barak and Mr. [Netanyahu believe that those concerns
will pale if Iran does get a nuclear weapon.]{.underline} This was a
point made in a public forum in Jerusalem this week by Maj. Gen. Amir
Eshel, chief of the army's planning division. Speaking of the former
leaders of Libya and Iraq, he said, "Who would have dared deal with
Qaddafi or Saddam Hussein if they had a nuclear capability? No way."

### 2NC Impact D 

**US says no to Israel**

**Golan '12** (Matti Golan, Veteran Israeli journalist, former
editor-in-chief of Ha\'aretz and Globes, "Israel won\'t attack Iran
without US go-ahead."

2012)

What is really going on between Israel and the US over Iran? Is what we
read and hear all that there is? In other words, [is Israel really
planning to attack Iran without coordination with the US?]{.underline}
Does Washington really oppose an Israeli attack on Iran? eports say yes,
that is exactly the case. But these reports do not meet my test of
common sense, and at the margins [the reports,]{.underline} at least to
me, [do not make sense]{.underline}. For example, reports that the US is
protecting its facilities and bases in Europe on the basis of an
assessment that Israel will attack Iran and that a counterattack would
soon follow. I read these reports that the US has accepted the
possibility of an Israeli attack, and that all the superpower can say in
the matter is that it is readying for such a possibility. Protection?
That\'s a response? I would expect that [alongside protecting its
facilities, the US would press Israel **not to attack**; and not just
the usual and not-so-painful pressure, but **measures that fit the
deed**]{.underline}. After all, an Israeli attack would result in an
Iranian response. What this response would entail, and whether it would
target Israel or other countries as well - this cannot be known, but it
is possible. The US knows this - how could it not know - and its
response is to protect facilities? Not a full assault on Israel with all
the means at its disposal (non-military means of course)? Behind the
scenes? Obviously, there are people who will say that the US is
undoubtedly doing just this behind the scenes. I don't buy it. [I know a
bit about how these things work]{.underline}, and the accepted way to
work is both behind the scenes and on the front stage. If there were
real and serious pressures, we would know about them. The US would make
sure that we know, because it would undoubtedly want to create public
opinion, which is an integral part of managing pressure. The bottom line
that I want to reach is that [if there are disagreements between Israel
and the US, they **are at the margins**]{.underline}. I believe that
**[there is no such thing]{.underline}** that [**Israel would embark on
an action** with such severe consequences,]{.underline} possibly even
existential consequences, [**without** coordination with **the
US.**]{.underline} [There is no such thing]{.underline}, in my opinion,
[that]{.underline} President Barack [Obama will be woken up one night
with the news of an Israeli attack. If Israel were to attack, it will be
with his consent, support, and knowledge]{.underline}. [So how do I
explain the many reports that Israel will launch an attack without
coordinating it with the US? It seems like a game]{.underline} to me.
It\'s objective? Many to give the US an alibi, as if it didn't know, in
order to avoid a confrontation with Iran; maybe it\'s a smokescreen to
conceal the real contacts and agreements between Washington and
Jerusalem; and maybe it\'s disinformation targeting Iran. [Everything is
possible, except for one thing: that Israel would attack Iran without
coordinating it with the world\'s great power and **Israel\'s only
friend**]{.underline}. It does not matter what is said and asserted, I
don't believe it.

#### No draw-in or esclaation---no Iran revanchism, allies are assured, nuclear deal will hold, missile tests won't escalate

**Tabatabai, 17**---co-founder and CEO of the Center for Applied
Research in Partnership with the Orient (Adnan, "Why Iran-US war of
words won\'t turn physical,"
<http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/iran-us-war-words-trump-escalating-rhetoric.html>,
dml)

[As much as the United States\' **new tone** toward Iran is
**worrisome**, and as much as the Islamic Republic\'s]{.underline} Jan.
29 [**ballistic missile test** is **disconcerting**, Tehran and
Washington are **unlikely to collide directly**. In both capitals,
decision-makers see an **urgent need for harsh rhetoric**]{.underline}
--- albeit for different reasons. [The Iranians see a need to **show
resilience** vis-a-vis an explicitly hostile US
administration]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the latter wants to make
clear]{.underline} to both its domestic and international audience [that
the **Obama era is over**. This involves signaling that the easing of
tensions with Iran has ended. It also involves **reassuring regional
allies** such as Saudi Arabia and Israel that Washington **would not
engage in a rapprochement** with Tehran at their expense]{.underline}.
Indeed, it should not come as a surprise that US national security
adviser Michael Flynn\'s warning that Iran \"is officially on notice\"
came shortly after lengthy phone calls between the White House and both
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia\'s King
Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. But [**escalating rhetoric aside**, the
**reality** is that US policy toward Iran has **largely remained
intact**]{.underline}. In the 13 months since the implementation of the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), [Iran has repeatedly
conducted ballistic missile tests. And it is **entitled to do
so**]{.underline}. In UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2231, which
endorses the nuclear deal, Iran is \"called upon\" not to carry out
tests of missiles \"designed\" to carry nuclear weapons. There is no
legally binding prohibition of such launches, unlike in UNSCR 1929 ---
the last and most harsh UN resolution against Iran over its nuclear
program --- which is superseded by UNSCR 2231. To be clear, [the nuclear
deal does not address Iran\'s missile program]{.underline}. Moreover,
the world powers with which Iran negotiated UNSCR 2231 --- apart from
the United States --- did not display any appetite to insert legally
binding text on Iran\'s missile tests. Thus, as provocative as the
missile tests may be, it is hard to see them providing a legal basis for
the United States to spearhead new multilateral sanctions, leaving
Washington with the option of adopting unilateral sanctions, which it
did on Feb. 3. While it took the Trump administration less than two
weeks to slap sanctions on Iran, the idea that there was a sanctions
freeze in Obama\'s final year in office is inaccurate. In fact, the
latest sanctions were prepared by the previous administration. In
January 2016, not long after the implementation of the nuclear deal,
changes were made to the Visa Waiver Program, which excluded Iranian
dual nationals and anyone who had visited Iran in the preceding five
years. Moreover, last December, Obama refrained from moving to veto the
congressional vote on a 10-year extension of the Iran Sanctions Act.
While these sanctions are unrelated to Iran\'s nuclear program, they
undoubtedly undermine the impact of the lifting of nuclear-related
sanctions. Iran has reacted to the escalating rhetoric and sanctions by
stressing that its missile program is defensive in nature, promising
retaliatory sanctions, and by carrying out new military drills. Yet,
[there is **little incentive** for Iran to **greatly alter the status**
quo. Iranian leaders see the JCPOA as **much more than just about the
U**nited **S**tates. It is an **international arrangement** with **world
powers** --- including the **E**uropean **U**nion, which Iran **holds in
high regard** as a **multinational institution**. They see this
arrangement as **beneficial** to Iran\'s **economic** and **security
calculations**. Foreign investment]{.underline}, albeit limited due to
remaining US sanctions, [is **trickling in**. The EU oil embargo has
been lifted and major contracts in the area of petrochemicals, civic
aviation and transport are increasingly sealed]{.underline}.
Additionally, [the JCPOA **provides a sense of security** to Iran. It is
**highly unlikely** for any party to the agreement to **green-light
military action** by another party against Iran. Hence, Iran has
**little incentive not to abide** by the nuclear deal]{.underline}. As
such, [while the cycle of escalating rhetoric is **discomforting** at a
time of deep uncertainty and conflict in the Middle East]{.underline},
it is important to see that [it **has its limits**]{.underline}. Short
of outright regime change, the United States has in fact rather limited
options to weaken and contain Iran. Given its experiences in places like
Iraq and Afghanistan, [it is **unlikely** that the United States will
launch **full-scale unilateral military action** against
Iran]{.underline}. [It could move to **arm a third country** to hit
Iranian infrastructure]{.underline}. This was tried with Iraq under
Saddam Hussein. Today, Saudi Arabia could be such a third country. But
given the lack of appetite in Riyadh for direct confrontation with
Tehran, and considering the downward spiral in the Saudi military
intervention against Yemen --- the poorest country in the region --- it
is unthinkable that Saudi Arabia would take such a step. Israel has
repeatedly threatened to attack Iranian nuclear sites. [But considering
the **low chances of success** and the **potentially dire
consequences**]{.underline}, including retaliatory attacks by Lebanon\'s
Hezbollah movement, it can be argued that [such threats **primarily
serve a political purpose**]{.underline}. Less costly measures aimed at
weakening and containing Iran, such as sanctions, have been tried and
tested. The Obama administration managed to put in place an
unprecedented multilateral sanctions regime targeting Tehran. Yet, it
was under those very sanctions that Iran's nuclear program evolved into
what the international community came to perceive as a major threat to
global security. Consequently, the Obama administration tried diplomacy.
And it worked. [The JCPOA reduced the capacity and increased the
transparency of Iran\'s nuclear program]{.underline} in exchange for the
lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. [And as the
I]{.underline}nternational [A]{.underline}tomic [E]{.underline}nergy
[A]{.underline}gency [has repeatedly certified, **the deal is working**.
Bearing in mind the nuclear deal is **fulfilling its objectives**, the
**limited military options** to contain Iran, and]{.underline} perhaps
most of all [the **likely US inability** to forge an international
consensus against Iran]{.underline} in case of its unilateral breach of
the accord, the security establishments of [both Israel and Saudi Arabia
have **publicly urged Washington** not to dismantle the JCPOA. While
**reveling** in the **newfound reassurances** from
Washington]{.underline}, it can thus be argued that [Riyadh and Tel Aviv
**understand the limits** of the cycle of escalation and]{.underline}
mostly [take solace in Trump\'s **unwillingness to realize their
nightmares** under Obama]{.underline}. In this vein, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [can be expected to do whatever it
can to minimize the economic benefits Iran will reap under the JCPOA. It
will likely seek to discredit Iran\'s regional policies]{.underline} to
prevent the normalization of the Islamic Republic\'s ties with the
world, while also diminishing the political capital the deal affords
Iran. [But it will do this **short of breaching the
accord**.]{.underline} Thus, [while likely to **squabble about
respective obligations** and **further drift away from rapprochement**,
**neither Iran nor the U**nited **S**tates has the **incentive** or
**ability** to take the new cycle of tension to a **military
confrontation**.]{.underline}

**Ogrosky 2016** (Lieutenant Colonel Christian Ogrosky, "A Tale Of One
China: How And Why Has The Efficacy Of United States Arms Sales To
Taiwan Changed Since 1990?", A Thesis Presented To The Faculty Of The
School Of Advanced Air And Space Studies For Completion Of Graduation
Requirements School Of Advanced Air And Space Studies Air University
Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, May 2016 ,
https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1030443.pdf)

Multiple options exist to attenuate or delay these impacts. Most
important, [while still desiring to engage the PRC as a competitor
rather than as an adversary, the United States should shift its China
policy from one of aspiration to one grounded in a more transactional
style]{.underline}. [Instead of appealing to the PRC to change its
behavior, often against Beijing's own interests, the United States
should employ a quid-pro-quo based approach to more effectively
influence China to become a responsible regional and global
stakeholder.]{.underline}

Another key step would be to [develop a clear and coordinated US policy
on Taiwan that incorporates the views of both the executive and
legislative branches, as is mandated by the TRA. Such a policy would
better enable the United States to resist PRC pressure and decrease
fluctuations in policy between parties and with changes in presidential
administrations]{.underline}.

A reinvigorated US security assistance policy for Taiwan must begin by
[making greater demands of the Taiwanese themselves]{.underline}. In
exchange for continuing security assistance, [American policy should
require Taiwan's commitment to increased defense spending as a
percentage of GDP, currently 1.9 percent, placing it closer to levels
budgeted by other nations facing existential threats such as Israel, 5.7
percent, South Korea, 2.8 percent, and Singapore, 3.5
percent.]{.underline}34 Shortly after taking office on 4 August 2008,
President Ma promised Taiwan would "demonstrate \[its\] determination to
defend \[itself\] by...raising \[its\] defense budget to three percent
of GDP."35 [Taiwan cannot expect even ambiguous American security
guarantees if it is not willing to more seriously provide for its own
defense.]{.underline} Next, [the United States should assist Taiwan in
diversifying its economy to lessen its current reliance on trade with
the PRC]{.underline}. A large step in this direction would be offering
Taiwan membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership if it proves willing
to undertake the politically painful economic changes necessary for
admission. Finally, [the United States should continue to make clear
that any unilateral changes to the status quo by Taiwan would preclude
American military assistance. If Taiwan's political leaders remain
sufficiently confident of ongoing US support, they will be more likely
to "forego any radical solutions for maintaining Taiwan's sovereignty
and national security status]{.underline}."36

Several simple American administrative changes would increase the
effectiveness of the security assistance provided to Taiwan and decrease
adverse PRC reactions. [The United States should reinstate the annual
Taiwan Arms Talks]{.underline} cancelled by President Bush in 2001.
[Taiwan is not a normal FMS customer. An annual meeting would ensure
that Taiwan's security assistance requests receive due consideration and
would provide an additional forum for discussions between Taiwanese and
American defense leaders]{.underline}. Next, the United States should
rescind its 2008 process change of delaying and bundling arms sales
notifications according to the "China calendar." [More frequent
individual program notifications would be less likely than the current
process to arouse PRC ire and would condition the PRC to expect routine
and ongoing American assistance to Taiwan]{.underline}. Additionally,
[individual sales would provide a variable response that the United
States could ratchet up or down based upon PRC actions in the South and
East China Seas or increased threats to Taiwan. Furthermore, this change
would improve Taiwan's ability to plan for itself, providing it a
greater sense of control of its own defense, decreasing Taiwan's
dependence on American security guarantees.]{.underline}

Another part of a renewed US strategy should be to [encourage greater
Direct Commercial Sales to Taiwan and the authorization of increased
technology transfers to allow Taiwan to indigenously construct advanced
weapon systems like submarines]{.underline}. After 1983, "US
policymakers paid close attention to FMS-case values, instead stressing
direct commercial sales (DCS) for arms to Taiwan. Examples of major DCS
programs, or hybrid FMS/DCS programs, during this period include the
CM-11/M48H main battle tank, the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF), the
PFG-2 frigate program, and the Tien Kong air defense system, among
others. Because of the smaller public footprint of direct commercial
sales, negative PRC responses to these types of US-Taiwan technical
transfer \[sic\], licensed production, or locally assembled within DCS
channels appear both subdued and rare."37

Furthermore, the United States should [reconsider the requirement to
make congressional notifications of security assistance
public]{.underline}. Originally passed to ensure arms sales to Taiwan
received sufficient congressional debate, "these little-noticed
provisions have dramatically altered the climate affecting arms sales to
Taiwan. What was once an obscure process is now increasingly open to
congressional and public debate."38 [Removing this public reminder of
Taiwan's self-governance and potential irritant to the PRC from the arms
transfer process might assist in reducing the strength of PRC
protests.]{.underline}

The United States should also [work to redefine PRC views of American
security assistance to Taiwan. Recognizing PRC attempts to draw red
lines around new technologies and key systems, the United States should
work to recast the bounds of the conversation]{.underline}. For missile
defense, [the United States could begin discussions on selling THAAD
systems and settle for further Patriot deliveries, if Taiwan has a
military requirement for the system. Air superiority discussions should
shift to the sale of F-35s, such that Beijing would no longer view the
sale of F-16C/Ds as the worst-case option. Following this pattern,
Taiwan could still receive critical, if not the most modern, systems for
key defense missions]{.underline}.

Next, [the United States should publicly link weapon sales to Taiwan
with PRC behavior in the East and South China Seas and especially to
threats to Taiwan's security. The United States should tie a future
South China Sea ADIZ declaration]{.underline}, [for example, to the
release of an advanced capability to Taiwan, such as F-16C/D aircraft.
The United States should meet PRC systems or actions that threaten
Taiwan with the sale of a system that helps to counter that threat. In
this way, the PRC would understand that "continued reliance on military
instruments of coercion to resolve political differences \[would\] come
at a cost. Sound US-China relations rest upon the assumption that
Beijing will adopt peaceful means to resolve differences with
Taiwan."]{.underline}39

Finally, [the United States should remind the PRC of the large and
ongoing role the United States plays in keeping Taiwan part of the
Chinese sphere of influence and preventing adverse Taiwanese actions,
including twice preventing Taiwan from developing nuclear weapons.40 The
PRC must understand that decreased American involvement in Taiwan
affairs would decrease American desires to continue to play this
consequential role in the future]{.underline}.

Matthew, Trump's Move On Tariffs Is Emblematic Of A Dangerous Tendency
To Concentrate Power, The Federalist,
[[http://thefederalist.com/2018/03/07/trumps-tariff-move-emphasizes-danger-of-concentrated-executive-power/]{.underline}](http://thefederalist.com/2018/03/07/trumps-tariff-move-emphasizes-danger-of-concentrated-executive-power/)

\*inserted for grammar

President [Trump's announcement that he plans to impose tariffs of 25
percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum, respectively, caught
markets and business leaders off guard.]{.underline} [Journalists have
paid a great deal of attention to its economic impacts]{.underline},
ranging from a short-term drop in stock prices for firms that use steel
in manufacturing to job losses and retaliatory trade restrictions from
partners. [Each of these is reason enough to reject Trump's tariffs as
unwise, but they are also emblematic of a graver danger. Beyond simply
being bad policy, Trump's **unilateral actions** on steel and aluminum
tariffs epitomize the dangers of the longstanding]{.underline} and,
regrettably, bipartisan [trend toward excessive concentration of power
in the executive branch]{.underline}. The president has justified his
actions by claiming he is acting in the interests of American workers
and national-security interests by preserving jobs in steel and aluminum
manufacturing, while preserving a domestically produced supply of each
metal in the case of a geopolitical crisis. On the former count he is
shortsighted; on the latter he is either deeply misguided or cynically
creating a means by which he can exercise a power that rightfully
belongs to Congress. Steelworkers and steel-town residents are
optimistic about the tariffs, hoping they will bring back jobs and
revive manufacturing communities. However, available evidence suggests
that automation and improvements in factory technology, would have
depressed employment at American steel mills with or without the
concurrent phenomenon of globalization. There is no tariff that can
un-ring that bell. Even if we were to grant that tariffs might help some
American steel manufacturers, theirs is a narrow interest compared to
the wide swath of industries --- which includes sectors as varied as
beer, automobiles, construction and energy --- that would face higher
production costs and slower job growth as result of higher prices for
raw materials, to say nothing of the millions of American consumers to
whom the tariffs could be passed on through higher prices for finished
goods. Given these ripple effects, benefits from the tariffs are
unlikely to accrue to blue-collar Americans. The direct economic impact
of these tariffs, however, is small next to their implications for
international trade writ large. It is here where the administration's
rhetoric begins to ring truly hollow: Trump and his advisers have
cloaked their protectionism in national-security terms as necessary to
counter Chinese domination of the market and ensure America has a ready
supply of critical raw materials, but the effects of their proposals
would in fact weaken America's position in the world. Despite its
massive presence in the global market, China only just cracks the top
five of steel importers to the United States. The countries ahead of
China --- Canada, South Korea, Mexico, and Brazil --- are all U.S.
allies or important strategic partners, as are Japan and the European
Union, both of whom have had intensely negative reactions to Trump's
proposals. Antagonizing allies and instigating tit-for-tat restrictions
across the international trade system simply to create a minor
irritation for Chinese steelmakers and create a small boost in domestic
production is, in national-security terms, a poor trade-off. [The most
insidious part of this story is also the one that has gotten the least
attention. Trump has casually seized for himself a power --- the ability
to levy tariffs --- that traditionally and rightfully belongs to
Congress]{.underline}. This legislative prerogative was, like so many,
passed to the executive branch by means of euphemism and bureaucratic
interpretation, with an odd wrinkle: in this case, Congress itself
played an active role in abdicating its responsibility. Section 232 of
the ironically titled Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the president
the right to impose tariffs in the case of a national security threat.
This exemption was no doubt intended for a scenario of large-scale
conflict in which the U.S. would have no choice but to produce its own
steel. The law, however, makes no such specifications, and national
security threats are like tans: anyone can make it look like they have
one, no matter how real it is. Thus did the Commerce Department conclude
that a status quo in which the United States imports one third of its
steel, mostly from its allies, constituted a national security threat
large enough to justify the president in imposing tax increases by fiat.
The Constitution explicitly grants the power to levy taxes, including
tariffs, to guard against corruption and arbitrary government, and both
of these are present in Trump's tariffs. [Trump has cloaked his tariff
proposals in populist rhetoric, but they represent cronyism of the
highest order, providing concentrated benefits to narrow political
interests while imposing much larger costs on the general public. **It
would be difficult for such a proposal to pass muster in Congress**,
whose members represent Americans with a vast array of contradicting
interests]{.underline}. [Setting factions against each other to make
legislation without broad appeal difficult to pass was a specific
purpose of Congress's design. The President, by comparison, is only one
man, who at any given time may have **multiple quacks** and
**rent-seekers** whispering **sweet, economically illiterate nothings in
his ear**.]{.underline} What matters here is not whether Donald Trump is
more or less virtuous than your average congressman, but that [should he
go into the business of picking winners and losers, there will be no one
to check his worst impulses]{.underline}. [In addition to being
vulnerable to corruption, government by executive order has another
shortcoming]{.underline}: **[it is arbitrary, and therefore
unpredictable]{.underline}**. [Under]{.underline} Barack [Obama's
administration, businesses and investors noted how the uncertain
regulatory environment created by his authoritarian governing style made
it difficult for them to commit resources for hiring and product
innovation]{.underline}. **[It is difficult to plan for the future when
one cannot be sure \[what\]\* would interrupt established practices and
alter the cost of doing business]{.underline}**. **[If Trump establishes
a precedent whereby the chief executive can assess tariffs without
warning or legislative deliberation, then regulatory lawlessness will
have reached new heights.]{.underline}** Conservatives rightly
recognized this as not only irresponsible, but dangerous, when it was
practiced by Barack Obama. It is no less dangerous now that it is
employed by Donald [Trump]{.underline}, who over the years [has shown
himself to be endlessly changeable, impulsive, and generous in his
estimation of his own power.]{.underline} The American project is a
direct and forceful rejection of the exact sort of arbitrary government
that Trump's tariffs represent. [The accumulation of power in the
executive branch, ultimately tilts policy in the direction of favored
players and interests rather than the common good, and deprives the
people of their means to change it.]{.underline} Conservatives generally
have a better grasp on this truth than our liberal friends, but too many
of us have been willing to turn a blind eye to it for partisan reasons.
[There is no economic outcome or political maneuver that is worth
further degrading the separation of powers]{.underline}, which the
previous administration already left on its knees. If we are to truly
protect the future of this nation by strengthening and preserving our
constitutional order, Republican policy goals cannot take precedence
over republican principles.

where a stable of pro-trade Republicans are trying to rein in the
administration. On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee will grill
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on the administration's trade policies,
with an eye on the avalanche of reprisals taken by countries around the
world.

Sen. Bob [Corker]{.underline}, a Tennessee Republican who's retiring
this year, has been one of the most outspoken congressional critics of
Trump's reliance on tariffs. "I haven't heard a single senator on our
side that hasn't expressed concern to the president directly about
what's happening with tariffs," said Corker on the Senate floor last
week.

He [introduced legislation]{.underline}, co-sponsored with eight other
Republicans and several Democrats, [that would allow Congress to review
the administration's use of "national security" justifications to slap
tariffs on imports,]{.underline} as it did with steel and aluminum and
threatens to do with cars. [It's won the backing of a **huge
cross-section** of American **business groups** worried **the
administration** is **abusing** the idea of national security to take
protectionist measures that will **hurt the economy**]{.underline}.

But Senate leadership hasn't yet allowed it to come up for a vote;
Corker's office says it "will continue to look for ways to get an
up-or-down vote on the floor."

Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, and a handful of other lawmakers from
both sides of the aisle are aiming even higher. They've co-sponsored a
bill that would give Congress the final say over any decision to raise
tariffs, essentially wresting back the power of trade policy from the
White House.

That bill hasn't been taken up in committee yet, but Sen. Lee's office
said "the bill has become more relevant" in light of the
administration's aggressive use of tariffs.

Some experts are skeptical that a majority of the Republican-controlled
Congress is now ready to buck Trump on trade, especially in an election
year. "Usually Congress is more protectionist than the president; it's
hard to get Congress to act in a pro-trade manner," said Scissors.

But that could change quickly, Scissors and others said, if Trump
follows through with the next round of tariffs on China, and especially
if he slaps tariffs on imported cars --- the impact of which could dwarf
anything announced so far.

"I think we're getting closer to where Congress reasserts its authority
on trade," said Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for
International Economics.

[If Republicans in Congress are starting to respond, that's due in no
small part to complaints from big business groups which have already
suffered from several rounds of tariffs and **gnawing uncertainty** over
the future of NAFTA.]{.underline} On Monday, [**more than 60 business
associations** told top lawmakers that they had "**deep and increasing
concern** with the direction of America's trade policy" and **called on
Congress to respond** to the administration's actions.]{.underline}

[Many]{.underline} of the affected groups rely on imported goods to make
finished, higher value products --- but those [businesses could be at
risk thanks to higher tariffs]{.underline}.

"What we have here is a cascading effect," said Ann Wilson, the senior
vice president for government affairs at the Motor and Equipment
Manufacturers Association, which represents the biggest manufacturing
sector in the United States.

"It deeply troubles me and deeply concerns me that this administration
is putting in place policies that hurt manufacturing," she said.

[The **political drama** in Washington has created]{.underline} the kind
of **[instability]{.underline}** [that makes Wall Street
nervous]{.underline}. [**Investors crave** nothing more than
**stability**]{.underline}, so when the market is aflutter, money is
lost and bad things happen. Normally, government is the source of the
problem. It now needs to be the solution. [With the **Executive Branch
intransigent**]{.underline}, [Congress must step up to revive a slowing
economy]{.underline} and [**restore investor confidence** in the capital
markets]{.underline}. As the 116th Congress gets underway, activist
liberals will supplant laissez-faire conservatives in House leadership
roles. Democrats may be tempted to avenge the wrongs of recent years by
swinging the policy pendulum 180 degrees. Big business is an easy and
attractive target. Under Trump there has been scant business regulation,
but to settle the score, Democrats are likely to take it out on business
for no good reason. This would be a misread of their November mandate
and a mistake of Olympic proportions. Nor is it what our nation needs
now. The Herculean task for Congress will be to reassure global markets
that the ship of state is secure. More than the Mueller investigation,
[investors want to know that a trade war will not go beyond words and
the **Fed** will **not bow** to **West Wing pressure**]{.underline}.
They want assurances that a simmering government shut-down will not boil
over onto key economic decisions. And they want to know that the next
two years will not be a policy pogrom on key business priorities.
Legitimate concerns to be sure because the danger of Congressional
over-reach is real. [Setting the markets aright will require a
**case-by-case regimen of regulatory restraint**]{.underline}. After
all, it would not be prudent to balance the political ledger on the
backs of business. The Democratic Party sorely needs to mend its
relationship with business if it is to lay claim to good governance, let
alone leadership in 2020 or beyond. Myopia should not be part of their
equation. Broad-brush regulation of banking, communications, finance,
media, and mergers, for example, should give way to reasonable oversight
and focused policy decisions that will guide, not gouge, business.
Americans seem to like the fact that government stays clear of the
day-to-day affairs of business but sets up guardrails when it is headed
off-track. Congress rightfully should examine egregious business
practices that offend societal norms. It is okay to castigate companies
for gender discrimination, lack of diversity, privacy breaches and
negligence in national security. Shining the spotlight on bad corporate
actors makes us a better nation and industry associations should embrace
change in that context. But bashing business as fidelity to Democratic
dogma should be eschewed out of hand. Democrats need not become the
anti-business brigade. Let's face facts. The business of America is
business. From online entrepreneurs to global technology giants, the
U.S. economy impacts international markets in an unparalleled way. As
the world's third largest economy, the U.S. generated \$19.4 trillion,
behind China (\$23.1 trillion) and the EU (\$19.9 trillion). With a
growth rate of 3.4 percent, however, [the U.S. economy is slowing down,
**with a foreseeable recession.** With tech **stocks dragging** NASDAQ
down and a **sagging Dow**]{.underline}, the latter-day turbulence of
2018 has found footing in 2019. [The last thing investors need is a
two-year internecine **battle between Congress and the
President**]{.underline} when economic stabilization should be the order
of the day. Smart corporations should understand the shift underway.
[This has none of the hallmarks of a do-nothing Congress]{.underline}.
**[Pelosi]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Schumer]{.underline}**
[have shown they can coordinate on big policy issues and a resolve to
move full steam ahead]{.underline}. In so doing, they must be careful to
balance the popular with the pragmatic, especially on the corporate
agenda. The market needs stability and Congressional Democrats need to
grow beyond their beef with big business. Companies, too, need to
embrace the new rules of corporate responsibility, which have been
overlooked by Facebook, Google, Wells Fargo and several others. It may
sound good to denounce big banks, big mergers, big media and big tech,
for example, but scale has great value in the global economy. Without
scale, U.S. companies cannot compete globally for the next generation of
services, products and technologies for which American consumers clamor.
Without scale, investment seeks safe harbor and innovation remains
provincial. And without scale, America's access to emerging markets
stops at the border. With a recession looming, [the new Congress should
embrace its **Commerce Clause** role]{.underline} and
**[responsibility]{.underline}**. [It should rise to **reassure
investors** of America's market stability]{.underline} and temper the
reflex to over-tax and over-regulate business for no good reason. [Even
with the ongoing Executive -- Congressional tension, **Congress has the
power** to save the day for American investors]{.underline} and **[it
should use it]{.underline}**.

#### The effects worst effects of the trade war are tied to authority distribution

Kevin **Simmons**, **1-9**-19, (an economics professor at Austin College
in Sherman. He wrote this column for The Dallas Morning News, "The stock
market is reacting to Trump\'s erratic policies", The Dallas Morning
News,
https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/01/09/stock-market-reacting-trumps-erratic-policies)

[December was the worst month for the stock market **since
2008**]{.underline}. And the volatility makes you dizzy as [the
Dow]{.underline} Jones Industrial Average has [fluctuated over 1,000
points within a day.]{.underline} Not only does [it **complicate
financial decisions** by firms]{.underline}, but [anyone with plans to
retire]{.underline} soon [is scared to open the 401k
statement]{.underline}. The weakness and erratic behavior in the market
is puzzling given positive economic news like the recent jobs report.
But the market is forward looking, which means [it\'s not only current
economic activity that determines price changes]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} also [the **expectation** of what may happen in the
**future**.]{.underline} [**Fears** of a recession **drive prices down**
even when the economy is humming along nicely]{.underline}. And
increasingly, uncertainty regarding economic policy makes investors
nervous. In 1968, future Nobel laureate Milton Friedman spoke to the
annual meeting of the American Economic Association to outline his
prescription for how monetary policy should be applied. He suggested
policy makers keep the economy stable, but be prepared to offset major
economic disturbances. Also, he admonished them to avoid major policy
swings that confuse economic participants. While his focus was on
monetary policy (duties of the Federal Reserve) these ideas also apply
to government responsibilities such as trade and fiscal policy. [Trade
policy is]{.underline} current [news due to]{.underline} decisions by
the Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** administration. [Against the advice
of most economists]{.underline}, myself included, [the administration
took actions that negated existing and pending treaties]{.underline}.
When new tariffs were applied on imported goods, predictably the
response from trading partners was to increase tariffs on exported
American goods. This placed firms who either import goods to the U.S. or
export American goods in a bind. They have no good options. Either pass
the increased cost to their customers and watch their sales decline, or
leave prices alone and watch their profit margins fall. Both actions
lower expectations for future earnings, which investors take into
consideration when pricing the stock. Rather than keeping the economy
stable, as Friedman recommends, the trade policy does the opposite.
Plus, [it\'s a **major** and **unexpected swing** in trade policy from
that of previous administrations]{.underline}, Democrat or Republican.
[Adding to the turmoil is]{.underline} a **[dysfunctional fiscal
policy]{.underline}** [that predates the current
administration]{.underline}. Fiscal policy is the taxing and spending
powers of the government. Ideally, tax receipts should equal or come
close to our spending obligations. Beginning with the Bush
administration, the combination of tax rate reductions, unfunded wars, a
new Medicare benefit and the largest recession since the 1930s created
debt now exceeding \$21 trillion. Ultimately, that debt will drive up
interest rates and may damage the U.S. credit rating, further increasing
rates. [High interest rates spook investors because the debt market is
an alternative for investment capital]{.underline}. [For firms that
borrow money, high interest rates increase costs]{.underline}, which
diminishes profit. [Future **expected earnings** are now
**lower**]{.underline}, [so **investors** **decrease** their
**estimate** of what to pay for the stock]{.underline}. [Another
consequence of]{.underline} high [debt is weakening the government\'s
ability to respond to economic disturbances.]{.underline} [Once
the]{.underline} 20[08]{.underline}-09 [recession became
evident]{.underline}, the combination of [fiscal stimulus
and]{.underline} aggressive [monetary action arrested the
decline]{.underline}, initiating the slow climb to an expanding economy.
[But our current level of debt and the politicization of fiscal policy
generally make it less likely this tool can be effective in the
future.]{.underline} Solutions to our policy troubles are both obvious
and difficult. For [trade policy]{.underline}, we simply need to stop
the brinksmanship with our trading partners and return to actions that
encourage free trade. But this policy [originated with boasts made
during the **2016 presidential campaign**, so **recommendations from
experts are ignored**]{.underline}. Likewise, fiscal policy is equally
doomed. The fix is an increase in taxes, reductions in federal spending
or a combination of both. It\'s hard to imagine that happening. Economic
policy should be boring and non-controversial. For this to happen, we
need leaders whose objective is the nation\'s benefit rather than
scoring points on TV or needlessly attacking an opponent. That outcome
is beyond the discipline of economics. Economists can advise based on
empirical research. But our leaders should lead, not posture.

Trade War", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillevy/2019/03/20/the-endless-china-trade-war/#3387b1c88586)

President [Trump]{.underline} **[shook markets]{.underline}**
[Wednesday]{.underline} [when he warned that U.S. tariffs on China might
remain for a **prolonged period**]{.underline}. The warning came amidst
otherwise-happy talk of how negotiations were proceeding well and how
the two sides were hoping to wrap up a deal by April. [The episode
does]{.underline} help [**clarify** some **central points** about Trump
administration **trade policy**]{.underline}. First, there is the
question of whether President [Trump]{.underline} [employs tariffs as a
means to]{.underline} achieve a world of even freer trade or whether he
[embrace]{.underline}s [protection for his own sake.]{.underline} The
President's more market-oriented advisers like to argue that he is
aiming for the former. Yet the President's track record and his Tweets
argue strongly for the latter. [It **never seems to be a good moment**
for this administration to step back from protection]{.underline}.
[When]{.underline} [the President's team negotiated a trade deal with
South Korea]{.underline}, they did eliminate steel tariffs, but [they
replaced them with quotas, which were even worse.]{.underline} Further,
as the Wall Street Journal noted disapprovingly for the NAFTA trade, the
steel and aluminum tariffs that were supposed to disappear once a deal
was reached have instead remained in place. **[The President likes
tariffs]{.underline}**. **[That's what he says.]{.underline}** **[That's
how he acts]{.underline}**. [It may be time to believe him]{.underline}.
A second implication of [the President's China-tariff warning is
confirmation that the administration continues to **handle** the
**negotiations badly**]{.underline}. Here we have to perform our own
analysis, rather than relying on the President's statements, since he
will inevitably describe himself as a masterful negotiator. Yet,
[in]{.underline} [the ongoing China talks]{.underline}, [the President
has disempowered key lieutenants such as]{.underline} Treasury Secretary
[Mnuchin]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Commerce Secretary
[Ross]{.underline} [by rejecting deals they had struck]{.underline}.
[He]{.underline} has **[diluted]{.underline}** U.S. **[bargaining
power]{.underline}** [by failing to focus U.S. concerns and by elevating
the importance of the bilateral trade balance, which has no economic
significance and is not readily addressable through Chinese policy
measures]{.underline}. [The President **undercut his own
credibility**]{.underline} [by making retaliatory threats that he
clearly does not want to keep]{.underline} (25 percent tariffs on \$200
billion of trade) [and]{.underline}, [in turn]{.underline}, repeatedly
**[setting and then waiving deadlines]{.underline}** [for China to
comply]{.underline} with his demands (January 1, then March 2).
[He]{.underline} has also [trapped himself into a fundamental conflict
between his]{.underline} own [impatience and]{.underline}
[deep]{.underline}, [time-consuming goals]{.underline}. It is [this
facet of his negotiating failure]{.underline}, in particular,
[that]{.underline} likely [prompted his warning about ongoing China
tariffs]{.underline}. [If there is to be a near-term deal consummated at
the sort of leaders' summit that]{.underline} President [Trump
favors]{.underline}, [it will]{.underline} likely [involve a modest set
of commitments]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [China]{.underline}. [Such
a package would]{.underline} likely [include]{.underline} the removal of
Chinese tariffs, plus [promises]{.underline} to purchase U.S. soybeans,
liquid natural gas, and other items. It would also likely include some
Chinese promises of reforms that they already planned to undertake,
along with vows not to misbehave in the future (in instances in which
the Chinese claim never to have misbehaved in the past, as with forced
technology transfer). [**None of that** would address the more serious
and deep-seated issues **of intellectual property
protection**]{.underline}, subsidies, or state-owned enterprises, for
example. Thus, [the quandary: if the President agrees to remove tariffs
with those problems unaddressed, **he will** appear to **have failed**
by his own measures]{.underline}. [Yet if he maintains the tariffs, it
is hard to see why the Chinese would be willing to reach a
deal]{.underline} and give the President the victory summit he desires.
In this latter case, the president will appear to have failed by any
measure. [This is the unfortunate outcome of **artless negotiating.**
This all should have made **investors** **highly** **skeptical** of
claims **that any resolution** to economic conflict with China is right
at hand. The President's advisers]{.underline} are happy to
[feed]{.underline} that [resolution narrative with quotes]{.underline}.
Never mind that those [quotes]{.underline} begin to [sound familiar, as
they are used and reused over months of fruitless
bargaining]{.underline}. [The difficult challenge will come
for]{.underline} American [businesses]{.underline} and farmers who have
[to make investment]{.underline} and planting [decisions based on their
**forecasts** of the President's **erratic trade
behavior**]{.underline}. [His latest China trade warning offered them
some guidance: **they should count on tariffs.**]{.underline}

<https://www.aei.org/publication/the-taiwan-relations-act-at-40-its-time-to-deepen-ties/>
, April 8, 2019)

For these reasons, Congress should use the opportunity presented by the
40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act to assess its successes,
failures, and the changes that need to be made so that the United States
can still fulfill its original intent to the people of Taiwan. The broad
and deep relationship with Taipei that existed between 1949 and 1979 has
narrowed[. Congress can reinvigorate the spirit of the Act by pursuing a
multi-pronged agenda for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.]{.underline}

[First, as the United States encourages partners to pursue economic
decoupling from mainland China in sensitive sectors, it should also
initiate negotiations with Taipei on a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement.
China's military buildup and its provocative maneuvers in the Taiwan
Strait tend to command the most attention, but Taiwanese economic
dependence on the mainland is also a significant national security
challenge. Deepening trade and investment ties to the United States and
other partners will be key to Taiwan's continued independent existence,
making it more difficult for Beijing to utilize economic coercion to
interfere in domestic Taiwanese politics. Congress can encourage the
Trump Administration to accept the Tsai government's offer to resolve
longstanding irritants in the U.S.-Taiwan trade relationship and begin
negotiations on a free trade agreement as quickly as
possible.]{.underline}

[Second, the Taiwan Relations Act states that Congress intended to
authorize "the continuation of commercial, cultural, and other relations
between the people of the United States and the people on
Taiwan."]{.underline} Yet while business and cultural ties have
continued to flourish, [official interactions have become limited
because of the caution of Administrations of both American political
parties]{.underline}. And while Republican and Democratic leaders in
Congress have met with Taiwanese officials, including the island's
Presidents, on U.S. soil and in Taipei, Executive Branch visits are
overwhelmingly limited to working-level officials. The rules governing
these contacts are not a matter of law but are set by State Department
guidelines that can be modified at any time. [Congress should direct the
Trump Administration to update those guidelines to ensure that U.S. and
Taiwanese officials of all ranks, including in the respective national
security agencies and militaries, can meet to discuss issues of mutual
interest. Congress should also consider making the Director of the
American Institute in Taiwan, our de facto embassy in Taipei, a
Senate-confirmed political position]{.underline}.

[Third, the United States should take the steps necessary to ensure that
the Taiwan Relations Act's declaration that "any effort to determine the
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means" would be "of grave
concern to the United States" is addressed. Given China's military
buildup across from Taiwan and its now routine air, naval, and missile
deployments designed to bully Taiwan, the Pentagon should, in addition
to regularizing arms sales to Taiwan, invite the Taiwanese military to
participate in exercises to increase the former's proficiency in
combined arms and to ensure that the two forces are able to operate
effectively together should the need arise.]{.underline}

[Finally, Beijing has put Taipei under increasing pressure by closing
off its international space. It has attempted to poach Taiwan's
remaining diplomatic allies and has used its growing clout in many
international organizations to block the more than 23 million Taiwanese
from being represented in international organizations on issues such as
health, law enforcement, and civil aviation. Congress should ensure that
U.S. partners and allies understand that promoting ties and cooperation
with Taiwan is a priority for U.S. policy, a priority that will be
considered when Washington assesses annual assistance
budgets.]{.underline}

**Abandoning Taiwan undercuts the credibility of US alliance commitments
globally -- this undermines the US-led international order -- sparks
armed conflict and decks cooperation needed to solve existential
threats**

at Davidson College, 11/29, \"Why giving up Taiwan will not help us with
China,\"
https://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/)

Taiwan Still Matters to US Interests While Gilley may be right in the
long run---Taiwan's people and leaders may decide someday that US
defense assistance has become an obstacle to their preferred path of
rapprochement with the PRC---for now, [the conventional strategic and
normative arguments for keeping the defense relationship in place remain
compelling]{.underline}. The most-cited strategic argument for
continuing US security assistance to Taiwan is that the existing
security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond serves the
interests of many nations. Within the network of global security
relationships, [Washington's behavior toward Taiwan **indicates its
attitude toward security assistance generally, including its alliance
commitments and willingness to honor other obligations around the
world**]{.underline}. As retired admiral Eric McVadon said, "**[American
credibility as an alliance partner]{.underline}** and as a bulwark of
peace and stability in the region and [**around the world would be
sorely diminished** were we to abandon]{.underline} the
\[[Taiwan]{.underline} Relations Act\], cease support of Taipei, and
lead Beijing to conclude that it can attack Taiwan and not be
repulsed."\[6\] The system of alliances the United States constructed in
Northeast Asia after World War II and the Korean War is not to be
discarded on a whim. From 1895 to 1945 Japan, Russia, and China battled
for regional supremacy, devastating huge swaths of Korea and China.
American security guarantees put in place in the mid-twentieth century
suspended those conflicts. Ample evidence exists in current
affairs---including conflicts over contested islands in the East and
South China Seas---to suggest that [military rivalry could return to
East Asia.]{.underline} The US presence, however it may offend China,
actually lightens Beijing's military burden by restraining neighboring
countries' military investments and easing their strategic anxiety. As
Glaser acknowledges, "the U.S. alliance with Japan also benefits China
by enabling Japan to spend far less on defense. Although the United
States' power far exceeds Japan's, China has seen the alliance as adding
to regional stability, because it fears Japan more than the United
States."\[7\] [Taming the military rivalries that once ravaged Northeast
Asia freed countries in the region to pursue domestic development and
provided a foundation for explosive economic growth and a liberal
economic order based on free markets and open trade]{.underline}.
[Military alliances stabilized the international system while new
economic and political organizations]{.underline} from the United
Nations to the World Trade Organization [nurtured nations' shared
interests]{.underline}. This system, in which the United States has
served as chief enforcer and guarantor, secured six decades of peace,
stability, and prosperity in non-Communist Northeast Asia. This US-led
order is far from perfect. Developing countries suffered terribly from
proxy wars and economic isolation during the Cold War, and since then
new threats---[from climate change to transnational
terrorism]{.underline}---have appeared. Although the bipolar competition
between two superpowers has disappeared, the need for global cooperation
to address economic and military challenges has not. [**Nations continue
to look to the United States to provide leadership** in mobilizing that
cooperation and addressing those threats, and how the United States
manages its relationships with longtime friends, including Taiwan, **is
an important measure of its commitment to that leadership
role**]{.underline}. Glaser dismisses the idea that security assistance
to Taiwan helps sustain the postwar security architecture in East Asia.
He writes, "the risks of reduced U.S. credibility for protecting allies
. . . should be small, especially if any change in policy on Taiwan is
accompanied by countervailing measures."\[8\] Certainly, other nations
differentiate between Taiwan---which not only is not a formal US ally,
but which the US government does not even recognize as a state---and
other US defense partners. Nonetheless, **[no competent security planner
would dismiss a US retreat from a long-standing security commitment as
irrelevant]{.underline}**, especially if it appears driven by American
weakness. [If Washington appears to be backing away from its commitment
to the alliances and institutions in which it has invested so much,
other governments will take that as a sign that they **may not be able
to rely on US-backed security arrangements** to ensure their future
security]{.underline}, forcing them to become more competitive and
individualistic. According to retired Army colonel and military analyst
Albert Willner, **[America's friends already are on the alert for signs
of a decline in US commitments]{.underline}**. He said in an interview,
"There is a growing sense in the world that the US is a fair-weather
friend, it won't be there for the long run. This causes people in many
countries to maneuver ahead of time, to get into position in
anticipation of the day the US pulls back. [If the US makes decisions
regarding Taiwan that reinforce this perception, **it will have profound
implications for our other relationships**]{.underline}." Another
strategic interest the United States has in maintaining close ties to
Taiwan rests with Taiwan's position on the front line of China's rise.
China's behavior toward Taiwan indicates how it will perform its role as
a lead actor on the world stage. As Randall Schriver, a former deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, put it,
"Beijing's ambitions go beyond Taiwan, but right now, it's the Taiwan
issue that drives their military modernization, so it's very important
to us. Taiwan is a prism through which we can understand China's
evolution, and gain insights into it." Richard Bush, a leading analyst
of the US-PRC-Taiwan relationship, summarized these concerns when he
said, "[How the Taiwan Strait issue is resolved is an important
test]{.underline}---perhaps the most important test---[of what kind of
great power China will be and of how the US will play its role as the
guardian of the international system]{.underline}." By extension, how
the United States and its allies treat Taiwan is an important indicator
of what other countries in the region can expect from Washington as the
PRC's influence expands. They may ask, [if the United States acquiesces
to a rising China on the Taiwan issue, will it also acquiesce on issues
important to them?]{.underline}

Jessica Yeats, "In the same way that deterrence must be tailored to each
actor, situation, and form of warfare, assurance must be tailored to the
strategic culture, threat perceptions, values, and specific concerns of
each ally."1 In this paper, we primarily address the requirements of the
latter, focusing on U.S. efforts to assure its two Northeast Asian
treaty allies: Japan and South Korea. After analyzing the current
security environment---specifically the assurance requirements in
Northeast Asia in this second, post-Cold War nuclear age---we turn to
the initial steps that the United States has taken to strengthen
assurance. Finally, we explore the current assurance agenda with Japan
and South Korea, highlighting key challenges and opportunities. Dubbed
the second nuclear age,2 the current context has been widely discussed
for its differences with the Cold War, or the world's first nuclear age.
During this first age, two nuclear superpowers were locked in a
competition for global dominance with allies on each side, a handful of
which developed small nuclear arsenals. U.S.--Soviet competition was
intense, but remained cold in part because Washington and Moscow
developed arms-control and crisismanagement mechanisms to regulate their
behavior. Stability endured because even though Washington and Moscow
did not control all the triggers, they had sufficient authority to keep
bloc discipline and avoid becoming entrapped in a nuclear war. The
security environment was always extremely dangerous because the
possibility of global nuclear annihilation was omnipresent, but per the
notorious formula, "a stable balance of terror" endured.3 The end of the
Cold War gave rise to hopes---mainly in Western quarters--- that nuclear
weapons would be relegated to the dustbin of history.4 This belief led
the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to downsize their
arsenals and assist a financially-strapped Russia to do the same.
Meanwhile, several states across Asia---in Western Asia (the Middle
East), South Asia, and East Asia---developed nuclear and long-range
missile programs.5 China's efforts to modernize its nuclear and missile
forces continued steadily. India and Pakistan pushed forward with their
own programs and, after exploding nuclear devices in 1998, became
nuclear-armed states. North Korea conducted several rocket tests during
the late 1990s and tested its first nuclear device in 2006. Iran, Syria,
and others also developed nuclear and missile programs. By the early
21st century, the Cold War order tightly controlled by the United States
and the Soviet Union was replaced by a multiplayer arena with several
less experienced nuclear decision-making parties and an epicenter in
Asia. As a result, today, while there is less risk of global
annihilation--- both because major-power relations have improved and
because important firebreaks against conflict are in place, including
robust crisis management mechanisms and enhanced economic
interdependence---[the **potential for war, and**]{.underline} even
[**nuclear use, is growing**.]{.underline}6 Not surprisingly, [these
developments have led U.S. allies to seek strengthened assurances that
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [their main
security guarantor]{.underline}, **[will continue to protect them from
coercion]{.underline}** and attack. The assurance challenge is
particularly difficult because it turns on more than effective
deterrence. Deterrence primarily requires the United States to influence
an adversary's calculus at critical moments during a crisis. For allies
to be fully assured, however, the United States must, during peacetime,
convince them 1) that U.S. extended deterrence will succeed in
preventing adversaries from challenging their core interests, and 2)
that should deterrence fail, the United States can and will provide for
their defense. Hence former British defense minister Denis Healey's
formulation that during the Cold War it took "only five percent
credibility of U.S. retaliation to deter the Russians, but ninety-five
percent credibility to reassure the Europeans."7 In the second nuclear
age, it is more difficult for the United States to assure its Northeast
Asian allies than it was during the Cold War. James Schoff notes that
during the Cold War "the U.S. commitment to counter the Soviet threat
was largely unquestioned in Tokyo, and the details about how deterrence
worked mattered little."8 Today, [the United States must convince allies
that it can deter **multiple nuclear-armed adversaries**]{.underline},
some of whom have less adversarial relations with the United States than
the Soviet Union did. Just as important, the United States also faces an
equally difficult task of convincing its allies that it could and would
respond should extended deterrence fail. [North Korea continues to
develop long-range missiles and nuclear weapons,]{.underline} and [China
is modernizing its military]{.underline} [and acting]{.underline}
increasingly [assertively]{.underline}. The United States' relationship
with China is also more complex than its Cold War relationship with the
Soviet Union, featuring varying degrees of competition and cooperation.
At the same time, the United States has shifted from a 1960s deterrent
posture of deploying thousands of nuclear weapons, including 3,000
forward deployed in the Asia--Pacific (1,200 in Okinawa), to one with
far fewer deployed nuclear weapons and none forward-deployed in Asia.9
U.S. assurance of allies exists along a spectrum, and **[Washington must
carefully balance its desire to reduce allied anxiety against other
interests]{.underline}**. There are some allied interests that the
United States---rightly---does not deem worthy of risking war. But [if
the gap between the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and its allies becomes]{.underline} too [large]{.underline}, [allies
will lose faith in]{.underline} U.S. [assurance]{.underline}, which
could have disruptive consequences. In the worst case scenario for the
United States, [Japan or South Korea might]{.underline} choose to
[bandwagon]{.underline} [with]{.underline} U.S.
[competitors]{.underline} in the region. Another slightly better, but
still deeply troublesome, [possibility]{.underline} is for **[Tokyo and
Seoul]{.underline}** to [develop]{.underline} [nuclear
arsenals]{.underline} of their own, [which would]{.underline} likely
**[eviscerate the remaining credibility of the]{.underline}** Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (**[NPT]{.underline}**). In either case, [a loss
of confidence in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as a
reliable security guarantor in Northeast Asia]{.underline} [would send
reverberations across]{.underline} **[the entire U.S. alliance
system]{.underline}**. [Development of nuc]{.underline}lear
weapon[s]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [Japan]{.underline} or South
Korea [is not a farfetched scenario]{.underline}. [Both
possess]{.underline} the [latent capability]{.underline} [to
develop]{.underline} weapons [programs]{.underline} relatively
**[quickly]{.underline}**, and some in South Korea and to a lesser
extent Japan have advocated that their countries should go nuclear if
the Northeast Asian security environment deteriorates or they lose
confidence in the United States as a reliable guarantor.10 In South
Korea, there are also signs of public support for nuclearization. After
North Korea's third nuclear test, for example, an Asan Institute poll
revealed that 66 percent of people in South Korea wanted nuclear
weapons.11

Andrew T.H., Security and Conflict in East Asia, p. 31

[East Asia's arms race leads to the classic problem of the security
dilemma, in which a state that is perceived as becoming too powerful
leads to counter-acquisitions by other states. This results in
misperceptions, conflict spirals, heightened tensions and ultimately
open conflict, thereby destroying the very security that arms are
supposed to guarantee]{.underline} (Jervis 1976). East Asia's sustained
economic rise since the end of the Korean War in 1953 and [the lack of
any major conflict since has lulled many into believing that growing
economic interdependence will make war unlikely in that
region]{.underline} (Khoo 2013: 47-48). However, **[this is a false
premise as significant historical antagonisms have
remained.]{.underline}** [Japan's imperialism prior to 1945 and its
failure adequately to account for its past continues to stir up strong
nationalist emotions in China and South Korea]{.underline}. In
additions, t**[he divisions between North Korea and South Korea are as
strong as intractable as ever, leading to an arms race on the Korean
peninsula]{.underline}**. [The situation is compounded by the weakness
or absence of regional institutions, regimes and laws that could
regulate interstate relations, build trust and confidence- and
security-building measures]{.underline} which were in pace in Europe
during the Cold War and helped to calm tensions as well as contain the
arms race exist in Asia. Within East Asia itself, [the Six-Party Talks
have focused only on the Korean issue and have not managed to stem North
Korea's open brinkmanship]{.underline} that in early 2013 almost brought
the Korean peninsula to war again. [The arms race in East Asia is
dangerous owing to the increased risk of **miscalculation as a result of
misperception**]{.underline}. Chinese policymakers appear to be
convinced that Japan is dominated by right-wing conservatives bent on
reviving militarism (Glosserman 2012). At the same time, [there is also
a perception within China that given its growing strength, it should now
aggressively assert what it perceives to be its legitimate claims in the
East and South China Seas]{.underline}. Thus, China's nationalist
discourse perceives that the problems about disputed territory emanate
from other powers, not China (Sutter 2012). [The consequences of
conflict between China and Japan, on the Korean peninsula or over
Taiwan, however, will not stay regional]{.underline}. As a key player in
East Asia[, the USA, which has security commitments to Japan and South
Korea, residual commitments to Taiwan, and troops on the ground in East
Asia and in the Western Pacific, **will be drawn in.** The problem is
that any conflict in East Asia is not likely to remain conventional for
long]{.underline}. In fact**[, it is likely that it would rapidly
escalate into a nuclear war]{.underline}** [because three of the key
players, namely China, North Korea and the USA, possess nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

[The United States and Japan confront a demanding paradox]{.underline}:
**[never has the alliance been stronger]{.underline}**; [yet never
before has it been challenged by the complexity of the world it faces
today]{.underline}: tectonic [global power shifts]{.underline}; the
growing [resistance to globalization,]{.underline} particularly in the
U.S. and Western Europe; the rise of excessive [nationalism]{.underline}
in many societies; [and]{.underline} the rise of dangerous [regional and
global actors with nuclear strike capabilities.]{.underline} During its
first fourteen months, the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[has]{.underline} already [reconfirmed the U.S. commitment to
recalibrate the alliance to keep it relevant and productive in
addressing growing regional]{.underline} [threats and economic
uncertainties]{.underline}. President [Trump]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} Prime Minister [Abe]{.underline} [are both committed
to economic revitalization at home, strengthening defense
capabilities]{.underline} [and reducing excessive
government]{.underline} regulates that can hold back investment and
technological innovation. Abe's diplomatic experience and a more active
Japanese international role should naturally reinforce U.S. interests
and be welcomed by the United States. At the same time, active and
creative U.S. leadership is essential to the maintenance and
strengthening of the Alliance, which in turn is the foundation of
building and protecting the liberal international order, maintaining
security and prosperity in East Asia, and shaping outcomes that benefit
the interests of the United States, Japan and their allies and partners
in East Asia. In the current juncture of global uncertainty and
diversified threats to prosperity, the allies, [recognizing the unique
ways in which the alliance serves mutual interests and supports global
stability should work to integrate across-the-board cooperation into
their respective, comprehensive national strategies.]{.underline} This
is a challenge not only for policy makers in both countries, but also
for the wide-range of alliance stakeholders including legislators, state
and local governments, the private sector, members of civil society and
academia. As alliance partners, the United States and Japan benefited
greatly from this relationship. Much has been accomplished, but much
will be demanded of the alliance and its partners in the years ahead.
For both governments the time is opportune to reaffirm their commitment
to the alliance; to develop the "hard power" elements at its foundation;
to [maintain credible deterrence postures]{.underline}, both **[nuclear
and conventional]{.underline}**; [to prepare to meet "gray zone"
contingencies; to develop through diplomatic and military consultations
an alliance based, comprehensive approach to China and the nuclear and
missile threat posed by North Korea]{.underline}. At the same time, the
two governments should work to enhance the "soft power" appeal of the
alliance, shared commitments to democracy, openness, and a rules-based
order. As alliance partners, the two governments should act to
demonstrate leadership both in the Asia-Pacific region in support of its
evolving multilateral architecture and, beyond, in support of
international economic and financial institutions and in response to
international demands for leaderships and thereby enhance prospects for
stability and peaceful change.

As it has been over the past seven decades, [the U.S.-Japan alliance is
critical to maintaining international order in the Asia-Pacific region
based on the rule of law]{.underline}. Japan can speak confidently about
its contributions to the U.S.-Japan alliance and commitment to shaping
the regional order.

Since his return to power at the end of 2012, Prime Minister Shinzo
[Abe]{.underline}, as a part of his policy of Japan's "proactive
contribution to peace, under the principle of international
cooperation," [has]{.underline} [embarked on an ambitious strategy to
strengthen the foundations of Japan's national power beginning with
economic reform]{.underline} as a path to sustainable growth. [Security
policy features included record]{.underline} [levels of defense spending
and a package of recent reforms of Japan's defense policy]{.underline},
[national security structure, and military capabilities]{.underline}.
The Abe government's [security policies]{.underline} also
[include]{.underline} [enhanced defense cooperation]{.underline} with
the United States and other partners, namely Australia, India, the
Republic of Korea, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the
United Kingdom and France.

In December 2015, Japan and the United States reached agreement on a
five year Host Nation Support (HNS) package, worth approximately 189.9
billion Yen (about \$1.8 billion at the exchange rate at the time of
writing this report) per year. The agreement covers costs related to the
stationing of U.S. forces in Japan and outlines Japan's share of costs
related to the Japanese workforce on U.S. bases, utilities, training
relocation expenses and facilities improvement. Under the agreement,
Japan, in 2015, actually provided an estimated annual support of 191
billion Yen, approximately 86.4 percent of total U.S. costs, excluding
the personnel costs of the American forces themselves.

[Japan is also making a significant contribution to maritime capacity
building in Southeast Asia.]{.underline} Prime Minister
[Abe]{.underline} has [invested]{.underline} [heavily]{.underline} [in
regional diplomacy with]{.underline} particular [emphasis on
Southeast]{.underline} [Asia and regional institutions]{.underline},
[where long-standing rules and norms for economic and security affairs,
particularly maritime security, are increasingly contested]{.underline}.
Abe's commitment to infrastructure financing is no less an important
contribution to sustainability and growth in Southeast Asia and beyond.
In May 2015, Abe announced that Japan, in collaboration with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), would provide Asia with \$110 billion innovative
infrastructure financing over five years. At the G7 summit meeting held
in Ise-Shima, Japan, in May 2016, he stated that Japan would implement
\$200 billion high-quality infrastructure investments over the next five
years, not only in Asia but around the world. Japan and the U.S. should
coordinate efforts to expand the resources and lending capacities of the
ADB and World Bank/International Finance Corporation (IFC), particularly
for infrastructure loans.

[The U.S.-Japan alliance]{.underline}, as the cornerstone of Japanese
foreign policy, naturally [attains prominence in this strategic
construct]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [Abe]{.underline}
government [has worked closely with the United States to strengthen the
security and economic pillars of the alliance.]{.underline}

The two governments revised the guidelines for bilateral defense
cooperation in 2015 to broaden the scope for functional cooperation to
include areas such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance,
air and missile defense, maritime security, space and cyber, and
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The guidelines also
strengthen bilateral security cooperation by building on Japan's defense
policy reforms, namely the decision to reinterpret the constitution to
allow the limited exercise of the right of collective self-defense, to
further integrate the operations of Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the
U.S. military, in particular with respect to missile defense, in
response to "gray zone" contingencies as well as to promote coordination
with third countries.

On the economic front, joint leadership on the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP) trade negotiations was meant to ensure high standards for trade
liberalization and regional economic integration that would shape the
regional economic order. [The Trump administration's decision to
withdraw from TPP r]{.underline}emoved a pillar of U.S. policy toward
the Asia-Pacific region and, with no effective replacement on the
horizon, [introduced an element of uncertainty]{.underline} in the
bilateral economic relationship and more broadly, the future of the
regional trade architecture. The U.S. approach to favor bilateral over
multilateral trade arrangements appears out of step with the prevailing
trends in Asia.

[To address these concerns]{.underline}, Prime Minster [Abe
and]{.underline} President [Trump]{.underline} [emphasized in their
Summit Joint Statement]{.underline} in February 2017 that "[they remain
**fully committed** to strengthening the economic]{.underline}
[relations]{.underline} between their two countries and across the
region, based on rules for free and fair trade. This will include
setting high trade and investment standards, reducing market barriers
and enhancing opportunities for economic and job growth in the
Asia-Pacific."

In April 2017, the U.S. and Japanese teams headed by Deputy Prime
Minister Taro Aso and Vice President Mike Pence met in Tokyo to initiate
the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Vice
President agreed to structure the dialogue along three policy lines:
Common Strategy on Trade and Investment Rules and Issues; Cooperation in
Economic and Structural Policies; and Sectoral Cooperation. The Economic
Dialogue was reconvened in October. President Trump's strong preference
for bilateral trade agreements over multilateral constructs and
discussion of a bilateral U.S.-Japan FTA is receiving a tepid Japanese
response. President Trump's refusal to exempt Japan from new tariffs on
steel and aluminum imports in March 2018 added a degree of friction to
the bilateral relationship. Japan hopes the United States will return to
some revised version of the TPP. Although President Trump's recent
remark in Davos that he would consider re-entering the TPP if the United
States got a "substantially better deal" is encouraging, it is not
certain at present if that will really happen. In the interim, Japan has
stepped up its defense of free trade, with an impressive finalization of
the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTTP, also referred to as TPP 11). Regardless of the U.S.
position, the ROK, Thailand, Philippines and even the U.K. have
expressed interest in joining CPTPP. Abe's another important achievement
was the finalization of the negotiations on the EU-Japan economic
partnership accord. In addition, Abe has been seeking to move forward
with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)
negotiations.

In the near term, [the personal relationship between]{.underline} Prime
Minister [Abe and]{.underline} President [Trump]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} **[significantly shape]{.underline}** [the parameters
for bilateral cooperation]{.underline}. The [Trump-Abe summits and
visits to Japan by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and]{.underline}
then [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speak to elements of **continuity
in the security alliance**]{.underline}. Relative [domestic political
stability in Japan allows]{.underline} Prime Minister [Abe to present
himself as a **trusted counterpart**]{.underline}, [able to develop and
implement joint initiatives with the]{.underline} U.S. [Trump
administration]{.underline}.

[At the same time, Japan and the United States are faced with complex
regional challenges that underscore the strategic import of their
bilateral alliance]{.underline}. [This is particularly the case with
respect to]{.underline} [China's increasing assertiveness]{.underline}
particularly in maritime Asia [and North Korea's disturbing advances in
its nuclear and missile programs]{.underline}. The [Trump]{.underline}
Administration **[clearly acknowledges this fact]{.underline}**, as [the
National Security Strategy issued]{.underline} on December 18
[maintains]{.underline} that "[U.S. allies are critical to responding to
mutual threats]{.underline}, such as North Korea, and preserving our
mutual interests in the Indo-Pacific region. . . . [We welcome and
support the strong leadership role of our critical ally, Japan."
Bilateral diplomacy between the United States and Japan could very well
yield new avenues for economic and security cooperation]{.underline},
but the prospects for sustaining the normative aspects of the alliance
agenda---a shared commitment to maintaining an open, rules-based order,
governance of trade under the World Trade Organization, opposition to
the use of force or coercion to advance national interests and peaceful
resolution of disputes--- should be reaffirmed. It is critically
important to reaffirm the normative values that support the Alliance and
shared approaches to economic and security challenges in Asia and
beyond. Then Secretary of State [Tillerson did so during his visit to
Japan]{.underline} in March 2017, [noting]{.underline} that "[the
U.S.-Japan alliance represents the cornerstone for stability in
Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific because of our shared values; our
shared commitment to the rule of law, our shared commitment to countries
following international norms, and we look forward to strengthening the
alliance further]{.underline}." Such a commitment should be maintained
and repeatedly expressed by the leaders of the two allies.

[Taiwan plays a key geostrategic and messaging role for the United
States in the Asia-Pacific region and with the PRC specifically.
Taiwan's location at **the heart** of the first island chain links Japan
and South Korea with the Philippines and other US partners in South East
Asia, limiting PRC access to the western Pacific.]{.underline}
Additionally, **[Taiwan acts as a bellwether for American allies and
partners to gauge the United States' commitment to the region,
especially vis-à-vis the PRC.]{.underline}** [As an economically
successful, ethnically Chinese, liberal democracy, Taiwan also serves as
a beacon of freedom and model for potential PRC political
reform]{.underline}. [Because some of the PRC's interests currently
conflict with those of the United States, and will likely increasingly
do so in the future, the United States should continue its efforts to
influence the PRC's development and integration into the global
system.]{.underline} Given its growing strength, [the PRC understandably
desires to alter the existing international order to best suit its
interests.]{.underline} American foreign policy should not attempt to
arrest, nor can it realistically stop, the PRC's development. Policy
makers can, however, comprehensively assess the security and political
environment in Asia and select policies that best protect and promote
American interests, including the preservation of the cross-Strait
status quo and Taiwan's security, as well as positive relations with the
PRC. Despite its strong economy and democratic system, [given the
complete mismatch in resources, Taiwan can no longer compete
head-to-head with PRC militarily]{.underline}. Even Taiwan's attempts to
adopt asymmetric and innovative defense capabilities, paired with the
advantages of island defense and foreign arms purchases, cannot
guarantee Taiwan's security without third-party intervention. Given its
international strategic objectives, and considering Taiwan's security
requirements, the United States has conducted a robust program of
security assistance, providing Taiwan with tens of billions of dollars
in weapons and related training since severing formal diplomatic
relations. From 1990 until the mid-2000s, the United States announced
the sale of numerous systems that greatly improved Taiwan's defense by
introducing new capabilities or by strengthening Taiwan's ability to
conduct missile defense, air superiority, or counter-invasion or
counter-blockade missions. The PRC's post-Tiananmen isolation, pursuit
of Most Favored Nation trading status and World Trade Organization
entry, and promises of American assistance in other fields moderated the
PRC's reaction to these sales. Despite selling weapons to Taiwan, the
United States still endeavored to preserve the regional military balance
and stability by declining to sell Taiwan systems more advanced than
those of the PRC. The 2008 and 2010 notifications, which included
Patriot PAC-3 missile defense and AH-64E Apache helicopters, still
provided new capabilities and strong support to Taiwan's key military
needs, but represented the last of the weapons President Bush authorized
in his 2001 announcement. Since 2007, according to the US-Taiwan
Business Council, the United States has not released new capabilities to
Taiwan. PRC reactions to these more recent notifications differed from
those following previous announcements. In response to the sale of
systems which it viewed as crossing red lines on missile defense, and in
light of its increased economic strength following the 2008 financial
crisis, the PRC severed military-to-military relations and cancelled
high-level meetings with the United States. Additionally, in 2010, for
the first time, the PRC threatened sanctions against American companies
providing weapons to Taiwan, although no evidence exists of PRC
enforcement of these sanctions. During the 2011 and 2015 arms sale
notifications, the United States failed to provide new capabilities or
additional numbers of key systems that would increase Taiwan's missile
defense, counter-invasion, counter-blockade, or air superiority
capabilities. Given the large decrease in the frequency and number of
American sales to Taiwan, as well as the lack of missile defense
systems, fighter aircraft, or submarines that violate its red lines, the
PRC moderated its reactions to American arms sales. While still issuing
protests and demarching American ambassadors, the PRC did not cancel
high-level meetings, sever military-to-military relations, or negatively
affect American interests, such as the non-proliferation efforts with
Iran and North Korea or the climate change negotiations following
notifications in 2011 and 2015. [The decrease in the number of US arms
sale to Taiwan and reduced utility of those systems appears linked to a
fear of angering an increasingly powerful PRC, the lack of political or
economic enticements such as MFN and WTO membership to mollify potential
PRC responses, and simple benign neglect on the part of the United
States toward Taiwan. Although policy makers are aware of China's
importance in economic and security affairs and appear willing to pay
the price to resist some of the PRC's more egregious actions, **they
fail to perceive the Taiwan's relevance to this effort and fail to
recognize the severity of the potential consequences of neglecting
Taiwan**]{.underline}. This was evidenced by the "Obama Administration's
decision rhetorically and substantively to omit Taiwan from its pivot to
Asia \[which\] telegraphs to China that Taiwan is no longer central to
US policy."1 Two American policy changes during this period also
affected the number and frequency of arms notifications to Taiwan. In
2001, President George W. Bush cancelled future sessions of the annual
US-Taiwan Arms Sales Talks in an attempt to normalize the weapons sale
process and treat Taiwan in the same manner as other security
cooperation partners. Unfortunately, given its unique political status
and the PRC's growing power and claims to sovereignty over the island,
Taiwan is not like every other customer. The lack of an annual arms
sales meeting, coupled with PRC pressure, has led to a marked decrease
in the quantity of arms sale notifications from an average of 4.97 per
year from 1990 until 2001 to an average of three per year from 2002
until 2008 and an average of just two per year from 2009 through 2016.
Prior to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the United States began freezing
notifications of arms sales to Taiwan and then bundling the sale of
individual systems together into larger packages. This allowed the
United States to reduce the both the number and frequency of
notifications and to attempt to minimize negative PRC reactions by
timing announcements when they are least likely to impact the crowded
schedule of bilateral US-PRC events. The freezing of notifications
violates instructions requiring the DoD to process Letters of Request
and Letters of Agreement within specific time limits. The packaging of
requests led to the over four-year gap between notifications from
September 2011 until December 2015, the longest period between
notifications since 1979 by a factor of two and a half. These long
delays complicate Taiwanese defense planning and increase the difficulty
of making future notifications after extended periods without sales due
to fear of PRC responses. Therefore, according to the arms sale
notifications reviewed, weapon sales to Taiwan in recent years have
become less helpful to its defense, fewer in number, delayed for
political reasons, and bundled together for sale compared to those of
previous years. Given these changes, and considering the growing
military threat Taiwan faces from the PRC, it is clear the United States
is not solely considering Taiwan's defense needs when considering arms
sales as stipulated by the Taiwan Relations Act. Instead it is also
weighing potential PRC responses when considering arms sales to Taiwan.
Given the importance of US-PRC economic and security relations, as well
as the number of American interests the PRC is now capable of
influencing, American consideration of PRC responses to arms sales to
Taiwan, is understandable despite contravening existing law. The United
States, however, must consider any decisions on its Taiwan policy with a
holistic view of the impacts, not just on Taiwan and the PRC but on
regional and global American interests. Multiple options exist to
attenuate or delay the PRC's ability to coerce Taiwan. Most importantly,
instead of appealing to the PRC to change its behavior, often against
its own interests, the United States should attempt to employ a more
transactional approach to bilateral relations in an effort to influence
China to become a responsible stakeholder. [The PRC purposefully links
its responses to Taiwan arms sales to interests the United States
values, such as non-proliferation, in an attempt to affect the
decision-making calculus of US policy makers. The United States,
however, often appears hesitant to employ a similar strategy to
influence PRC behavior]{.underline}. President George W. Bush appeared
to attempt this approach when he deferred the sale of Aegis destroyers
to Taiwan in 2001 contingent upon the PRC halting its ballistic missile
buildup opposite Taiwan. Despite the continued growth in PRC missile
deployments, however, the United States did not follow through on its
linkage by selling Aegis destroyers to Taiwan. A transactional China
policy more clearly linking PRC threats to Taiwan or regional security
with increased defensive arms sales to Taiwan benefits from
straightforward and very defensible logic. The United States must
ensure, however, that it does not wantonly employ such a formula due to
the risk of escalating tit-for-tat responses. [**Arms sales to Taiwan
would be a powerful bargaining chip to influence PRC behavior** because
of the island's centrality to CCP claims of legitimacy. The PRC's recent
East China Sea ADIZ declaration and its island building campaign in the
South China Sea could both easily justify additional major defensive
arms sales to Taiwan.]{.underline}

[The United States must consider its Taiwan policy within a holistic
framework of the potential outcomes, not just on Taiwan and the PRC, but
on global American interests as well. **As tempting as it may be to
believe** that removing "the Taiwan question" would dramatically improve
US-PRC relations, the PRC's position as a rising power challenging the
status quo and its recent assertiveness regarding its territorial
claims, suggest the PRC would **not** view American compromise on Taiwan
**as a move made out of strength, but rather one made out of
weakness.**]{.underline} Should the United States continue to defer
selling Taiwan weapons that provide new capabilities, as during the past
six years, it will not have an immediate impact on Taiwan's defense.
Instead, lacking new capabilities, Taiwan's military will continue its
slow but steady decline, especially considering the rapid and continuing
improvement made by PRC forces. Given these increasing military and
economic pressures, it is likely that either [Taiwan's leaders would
feel pressured to acquiesce to PRC political pressure or cross-Strait
stability would suffer. A decrease in the perceived willingness of the
United States to support Taiwan **would reverberate across the region to
US allies and partners, likely leading them to question the substance
and durability of US commitments**, potentially leading to decreased
balancing against and increased attempts to bandwagon with the PRC. It
would also severely impact American soft power, seemingly confirming the
narrative that the United States is a power in retreat and the PRC is
ascendant, lending greater credence to Chinese efforts to affect the
current international order.]{.underline}

#### The plan legitimizes PRC coercive military force, signals US retreat from the region and undermines the semiconductor industry

[Decreased American support for Taiwan would likely bring forward the
day when the PRC is able to bring Taiwan under its control]{.underline}
politically, economically, or militarily. Counter to the intent of the
United States' rebalance to Asia and the Pacific, [it would risk
**"legitimizing PRC use of military coercion to resolve political
differences with its neighbors and sends a signal to others in the
region of a diminished US commitment in Asia**.]{.underline}"[33 Were
the PRC to control Taiwan, it would be able to **project greater
military power** and influence in the East and South China Seas and gain
unfettered access to the western Pacific.]{.underline} [PRC control of
Taiwan would extend its control of key industries, such as
**semiconductor design and manufacturing, threatening American
security**. Perhaps most consequential, it would silence the world's
only Chinese democracy, thereby extinguishing the most effective beacon
for liberalism and pluralism for the Chinese mainland.]{.underline}

#### Washington needs to ensure Taiwan's self-defense in order to reassure allies and deter Chinese aggression 

**Chung 2019** (Lawrence Chung covers major news in Taiwan, ranging from
presidential and parliament elections to killer earthquakes and
typhoons. Most of his reports focus on Taiwan's relations with China,
specifically on the impact and possible developments of cross-strait
relations under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and
mainland-friendly Kuomintang governments. Before starting work at the
South China Morning Post in 2006, he wrote for Reuters and AFP for more
than 12 years. "US must support Taiwan with weapons against mainland
aggression, Donald Trump is told",

, 2/13/2019)

[A group of US scholars has called on]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump to be ready to deter aggression by mainland China against Taiwan,
maintain a strong military presence in the Western Pacific and help the
self-ruled island develop a strategy in tackling expansionist Beijing.
In a 53-page report released by the Task Force on US-China Policy -- a
group of China 17 specialists formed by the Asia Society -- Washington
was reminded of the long-standing American policy of insisting on a
peaceful resolution to the question of Taiwan's future and the extent of
the self-governing island's dependence upon US military
power]{.underline}. The panel of experts said the United States should
not break with nearly 50 years of practice and challenge Beijing's
one-China policy, a move that would inflame tensions across the Taiwan
Strait or, worse, precipitate military force from mainland China. The
report said: "[Washington must maintain a strong and credible military
presence in the Western Pacific to convince Beijing that the United
States still has serious military options]{.underline}," despite China's
rapid military expansion and development of advanced weapons. [The
report, "Course Correction: Toward an Effective and Sustainable China
Policy", addressed the gulf in military forces between Beijing and
Taipei and said it was necessary for Washington to "assist Taiwan in
developing asymmetric capabilities to hold off the massively superior
mainland military until the United States can bring forces to
bear".]{.underline} "Robust shore batteries, improved air defences,
mobile response units, and sea mines to counter landing craft can all
pose major problems for an invading People's Liberation Army (PLA)
force," the report said, suggesting that [Washington ensure that Taiwan
is properly equipped for self-defence.]{.underline}

### AT: Link Turns

#### The aff puts all our assurances in question -- spills over 

**Hooper**, **15** -- Fellow in the Asia Program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies and the Director of CSIS\'s Maritime
Transparency Initiative (Mira Rapp, \"Uncharted Waters: Extended
Deterrence and Maritime Disputes,
https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/twq.elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/TWQ_Spring2015_Hooper.pdf)

One reason why Washington should be attentive to the relationship
between Japan and the Philippines' sovereignty disputes and its extended
deterrence commitments is because of the role assurance plays in any
alliance. Extended deterrence is a highly perceptual undertaking, where
both allies and adversaries are concerned. [The **failure to persuade
allies** that their defense needs are being met at low levels of
conflict could]{.underline} conceivably **[have a deleterious
effect]{.underline}** **[on U.S. security guarantees
broadly]{.underline}**. [The belief that]{.underline} U.S. [extended
deterrence is inoperable]{.underline} at any level of escalation [could
**erode allies' faith** **in its**]{.underline} overall
**[credibility]{.underline}**. To remain active and engaged in the
region, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[will need to rely on its forward bases and
strong host-nation support]{.underline}**---[**if allies are wary** of
U.S. support]{.underline} in discrete areas, [they may pursue
capabilities or policies that may be **inimical to these interests**.
Another reason]{.underline} why [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should treat its
allies' territorial disputes as an extended deterrence concern is the
role]{.underline} that [these]{.underline} may [play in crisis
**stability** and]{.underline} crisis **[readiness]{.underline}**. U.S.
[neutrality towards allies' disputes may prove useful for deterrence if
a challenger]{.underline}---namely, China---[remains]{.underline}
reasonably well [convinced]{.underline} that [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [may]{.underline}
nonetheless [intervene]{.underline} on behalf of its partners in the
case of war. But [if Beijing believes that Washington will]{.underline}
likely [stand aside]{.underline} in an island row despite its alliance
commitments, [this may]{.underline} instead [invite opportunism and
"salami tactics"]{.underline} that test the commitment. Salami tactics
will be a less attractive resort if a challenger believes it cannot
slice much without provoking a serious response, but if the United
States waits to decide whether it will intervene, **[it may ultimately
find itself in a crisis or conflict that it could have
avoided.]{.underline}** Additionally, [while the United States may not
see a clear stake in discrete territorial disputes]{.underline}, [it
unequivocally has one in]{.underline} the maintenance of the political
and territorial status quo in [East Asia]{.underline} more broadly
defined. No one island feature will tip the balance of power in the
Pacific in China's favor, but if Beijing attempted over time to acquire
all the land it claims, this would be a strategic game-changer for U.S.
partners and Washington itself.

#### Perception matters and spills over -- our ev is comparative

Alex **Weisiger 15**, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the
University of Pennsylvania, Keren Yarhi-Milo, Assistant Professor of
Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University, \"Revisiting
Reputation: How Past Actions Matter in International Politics,\"
International Organization 69(2), Mar 2015, pp. 473-495

Our findings provide strong evidence that [**reputation for resolve
matters**. Although]{.underline} studies by reputation [critics are
correct to argue that]{.underline} realist variables such as [power and
interests play an important role in states' behavior]{.underline} during
crises, [**past actions have significant consequences**. Countries that
have backed down are **substantially more likely to face subsequent
challenges**]{.underline}. We argue that the discrepancy between our
results and those advanced by [reputation critics]{.underline} may stem
from their [focus on crisis decision making, where
information]{.underline} gleaned [from past action will already have
been incorporated into broader estimates of interests and]{.underline}
hence [is less likely to be referenced directly, as well as]{.underline}
from their [fail]{.underline}ure [to recognize that reputation acts
through estimates of an opponent's interests]{.underline}. That said,
our results do not provide unequivocal support in favor of the strong
version of reputation associated with Schelling. Rather, we observe that
the [effects of past actions remain]{.underline}, but are weaker, [when
the subsequent interaction less closely resembles the dispute in which
the country]{.underline} in question [earned its
reputation]{.underline}. Thus we find that past actions have a less
substantive effect on the probability of a new dispute when the
inferences are drawn by observers who were not involved in the previous
dispute. We further find that [lessons from territorial disputes
are]{.underline} much more [**strongly associated** with subsequent
territorial challenges]{.underline} than are lessons from nonterritorial
disputes. However, we find that [reputation for resolve is not
leader-specific]{.underline}, indicating that leader [turnover in a
country with a bad reputation should not]{.underline} significantly
[lower the probability that]{.underline} such a [country will be
challenged again]{.underline}. Important questions about reputation
remain. Reputation for resolve exists and is fairly general, but that
leaves unanswered questions about the generality of reputation for other
traits like honesty and reliability. Separately, although we find little
change in reputation after leadership turnover, further research would
be needed to definitively establish the degree to which reputations
affix to leaders or to states. It is not implausible that both the
generality of reputation and the degree to which inferences are drawn
about specific leaders or about states in general would vary by regime
type or over time. [Our results confirm what leaders]{.underline}
already intuitively [suspect: **reputation for resolve is worth
having**]{.underline} in international politics. [Although backing down
is not always]{.underline} the [wrong]{.underline} thing to do,
[leaders]{.underline} who contemplate doing so [should be aware of the
**associated costs**]{.underline}.

### Framing

**No Asian conflict BUT doesn't take out the DA -- allied prolif is the
only scenario for escalation**

[The]{.underline} first [problem with]{.underline} using **[the "2014 is
1914" analogy]{.underline}** [is that it doesn't even get the present
right]{.underline}. In all the ways that matter, [the]{.underline}
**[Asia-Pacific]{.underline}** region of today [is **unlike** Europe a
century ago]{.underline}. Although [some]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations [theorists
point to overarching]{.underline} [similarities]{.underline} -- **[China
is a rising power]{.underline}** seeking to reassert regional dominance
[and the U.S. is a great power with a preference for the status
quo]{.underline} -- [**the specific parallels simply aren't there.**
Asia]{.underline} today [lacks 1914 Europe's]{.underline} competing
**[webs of rigid alliances]{.underline}**. There is no Serbia-esque
regime yearning to carve an ethnically unified nation-state out of
existing political boundaries. **[China is not encircled]{.underline}**
(the protestations of some of its military planners notwithstanding),
[nor does **an insane monarch** lead it]{.underline}. [Asia is not swept
up in **a "Cult of the Offensive**]{.underline}" -- [the shared belief
that military technology makes it easier to attack than to
defend.]{.underline} If anything, [Beijing's acquisition of]{.underline}
**[anti-access/area denial]{.underline}** [weapons]{.underline} [systems
has convinced]{.underline} most [strategists that **defenders hold the
upper hand. Globalized trade and production**]{.underline} [chains have
increased]{.underline} **[the economic costs of war]{.underline}**. And
finally, for better or worse, we now live in a nuclear world. **[Nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}** [makes unilateral aggression much riskier for
China]{.underline} than it ever was for Germany. Conversely, [if the
nuclear]{.underline} [balance were **tipped by Japan, South Korea
or**]{.underline} -- even more problematically --
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** [acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [the
region would]{.underline} [likely become **far more volatile than
pre-war Europe**]{.underline}. In either case, nuclear weapons render
the parallel obsolete.

### OV---Timeframe

**Japanese prolif is quick, collapses regional security, and causes arms
races**

**Peng 2018**

2018-03-02 Wang Peng with the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force
Engineering University "Capable of possessing nuclear weapons overnight,
Japan\'s nuclear issue draws attention again"
http://english.chinamil.com.cn/view/2018-03/02/content_7957970.htm

Japanese media recently reported that the Japan-US Nuclear Cooperation
Agreement that will terminate in July 2018 was automatically extended on
January 16, 2018. As the agreement allows Japan to promote the
reprocessing of nuclear fuel, it is the basis for Japan\'s nuclear fuel
recycling policy, and the extension of the agreement has caught the
world's close attention. [Japan]{.underline} reportedly
[has]{.underline} a current [47 tons of plutonium, enough for about
6,000 nuclear bombs. Under such circumstances, it is an open secret that
Japan has strong capability of nuclear weapon manufacturing. In March
1995, a Japanese magazine announced]{.underline} that
[Japan]{.underline} [was able to manufacture a nuclear bomb in 183
days]{.underline}. Now, [this capability must have **improved
significantly**]{.underline} [thanks to]{.underline} the
[continuous]{.underline} [development and maturity of the country\'s
nuclear technology]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} June
[2016]{.underline}, then US Vice President [Biden]{.underline} [told the
American press]{.underline} in an interview that \"[Japan is capable of
possessing nuclear weapons overnight]{.underline}.\" American nuclear
expert [Kuznick]{.underline} even [said]{.underline} \"[Japan is **only
a screwdriver away** from making nuclear warheads\".]{.underline}
Moreover, [Japan is also strong in the Research and
Development]{.underline} (R&D[) of nuclear launchers and carriers. The
just-launched Epsilon solid fuel carrier rocket is a potential nuclear
warhead carrier and can become an intercontinental ballistic
missile]{.underline} with the range of 12,000 kilometers [with minor
modifications. Japan also has a huge conventional submarine
force]{.underline} with 22 submarines, [all of which can be modified to
launch cruise missiles]{.underline} [that carry nuclear
warheads]{.underline}. [Japan\'s F-15J military aircraft can also launch
nuclear bomb]{.underline}s upon modification [and therefore Japan
actually has the **material foundation**]{.underline} [for making
nuclear deployments on all fronts]{.underline}. On August 20, 2017, the
American website of National Interest magazine analyzed Japan\'s
possible deployment of its nuclear weapons based on the \"3D\" system.
Although its conclusion was that Japan\'s land missiles have a low
survival rate, and it noted that submerged nuclear submarines can hardly
launch nuclear weapons and air bombs are exposed to attack, it still
confirmed Japan\'s material strength and foundation in those areas.
[Japan\'s possession of nuclear weapons will change its national nature,
aggravate regional nuclear arms race and destroy regional
security]{.underline}. For a long time, Japan\'s possession of nuclear
weapons has been a highly sensitive topic. If that became a reality it
would have tremendous political and military impacts on the
international community. First of all, Japan\'s possession of nuclear
weapons would completely change its national nature. [The Japanese
government has revised the peaceful constitution]{.underline} [and
passed the new security bills]{.underline} in recent years in attempt
[to change the exclusively defensive military mission]{.underline} of
its self-defense forces, change Japan\'s political nature as a peaceful
country, and shake off the restraint on Japan\'s national militarization
by the post-war system. [In this process, the possession of nuclear
weapons is an extremely important symbol or bottom line]{.underline}.
[Once the bottom line is crossed]{.underline}, **[there will be no curb
on Japan\'s military strength]{.underline}** [and it will get on the
path of **militaristic revival** in the real sense.]{.underline} In
April 2017, a Russian expert on military strategy published an article,
saying that Japan is able to produce a large amount of nuclear weapons
within several months and leave the nuclear protection from the US. This
is thanks to Japan\'s silent but continuous nuclear energy development
over the years. As soon as it can escape the United States' control,
Japan will become a top nuclear power in the world. Second, [Japan\'s
possession of nuclear weapons will aggravate the nuclear arms race in
the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} region. The Asia-Pacific region has always
been a hotspot region in the nuclear arms race. Some countries, for
political or military purposes, have kept developing nuclear weapons
regardless of international conventions. Among those countries, Japan is
both an active and passive player. As a nation restricted by the
post-war system, [Japan\'s development of nuclear weapons will doubtless
alarm surrounding countries]{.underline}. [Especially in the process of
solving the protracted Korean nuclear]{.underline} [issue]{.underline},
[Japan\'s possession of nuclear weapons is a destructive factor from
**every perspective**]{.underline}. [After the]{.underline} Democratic
People\'s Republic of Korea ([DPRK]{.underline}) [had its sixth nuclear
test in September 2017]{.underline}, Japanese defense minister Itsunori
Onodera said in public that he believed the DPRK already possessed
nuclear weapons, which made the South Korean press highly alert. [The
South Korean press suspected]{.underline} that [Japan was hyping up the
nuclear threat from the DPRK to pave the way for its own possession of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [This will only further stimulate the
nuclear arms race in the Asia-Pacific region.]{.underline} Lastly,
Japan\'s possession of nuclear weapons will directly threaten regional
security. Why is Japan so bent on developing nuclear weapons? The direct
reason is to deal with the nuclear threat from the DPRK, but Japan has
more definite and long-term military goals. On April 6, 2002, Ichirō
Ozawa, head of Japan\'s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said at a
symposium in Fukushima City that \"if China is too bloated, Japan will
make nuclear weapons to contain it.\" \"The plutonium in Japan\'s
nuclear power plants is enough to make more than 4,000 nuclear warheads.
We are in no way inferior to China in military strength,\" said Ichirō
Ozawa. Such intense remarks fully reflect Japan\'s real intention in
developing nuclear weapons, and indicate that addressing the DPRK
nuclear threat is just the first step. International community is fully
aware of the danger of Japan\'s possession of nuclear weapons. On
October 9, 2015, the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association
(CACDA) and the China Institute of Nuclear Information & Economics
issued the Research Report on Nuclear Materials in Japan. The report
pointed out that Japan has a persistent and serious imbalance in the
supply and demand of nuclear materials which creates a risk of nuclear
proliferation and of an increase in nuclear terrorism. In early 2016,
James M. Acton, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said at the Japan National Press Club that Japan
has about 48 tons of plutonium that can be used for nuclear weapons,
which largely exceeds the volume that can be used by its nuclear power
plants. Japan\'s stock of plutonium may worsen the tension and the risk
of nuclear terrorism in Asia, and other countries may follow suit, James
said.

**The impact is quick**

**Windrem '14** (Robert Windrem, MA in American Studies @ Seton Hall
University, research fellow at the Center on Law and National Security
at NYU, Fellow at the Fordham School of Law's Center on National
Security, "Japan Has Nuclear \'Bomb in the Basement,\' and China Isn\'t
Happy," 11 March 2014,
http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/fukushima-anniversary/japan-has-nuclear-bomb-basement-china-isnt-happy-n48976)

But government officials and proliferation experts say
[Japan]{.underline} is happy to let neighbors like China and North Korea
believe it is part of the nuclear club, because it [has a **"bomb in the
basement"**]{.underline} --- [the material and the means to produce
nuclear weapons **within six months**]{.underline}, according to some
estimates. And with tensions rising in the region, China's belief in the
"bomb in the basement" is strong enough that it has demanded Japan get
rid of its massive stockpile of plutonium and drop plans to open a new
breeder reactor this fall. Japan signed the international Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which bans it from developing nuclear weapons,
more than 40 years ago. But according to a senior Japanese government
official deeply involved in the country's nuclear energy program, Japan
has been able to build nuclear weapons ever since it launched a
plutonium breeder reactor and a uranium enrichment plant 30 years ago.
"[Japan already has the technical capability]{.underline}, and has had
it since the 1980s," said the official. He said that once Japan had more
than five to 10 kilograms of plutonium, the amount needed for a single
weapon, it had "already gone over the threshold," and had a nuclear
deterrent. [Japan now has 9 tons of plutonium stockpiled at several
locations in Japan and another 35 tons stored in France and the U.K. The
**material is enough to create 5,000 nuclear bombs**]{.underline}. [The
country also has **1.2 tons of enriched uranium**. Technical ability
doesn't equate to a bomb, but experts suggest getting from raw plutonium
to a nuclear weapon could take **as little as six months** after the
political decision to go forward]{.underline}. [A senior U.S. official
familiar with Japanese nuclear strategy said the six-month figure
for]{.underline} a country with [Japan]{.underline}'s advanced nuclear
engineering infrastructure [was not out of the ballpark]{.underline},
and no expert gave an estimate of more than two years. In fact, many of
Japan's conservative politicians have long supported Japan's nuclear
power program because of its military potential. "The hawks love nuclear
weapons, so they like the nuclear power program as the best they can
do," said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-Proliferation
Program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in
California. "They don't want to give up the idea they have, to use it as
a deterrent." Many experts now see statements by Japanese politicians
about the potential military use of the nation's nuclear stores as part
of the "bomb in the basement" strategy, at least as much about
celebrating Japan's abilities and keeping its neighbors guessing as
actually building weapons. But pressure has been growing on Japan to
dump some of the trappings of its deterrent regardless. The U.S. wants
Japan to return 331 kilos of weapons grade plutonium -- enough for
between 40 and 50 weapons -- that it supplied during the Cold War. Japan
and the U.S. are expected to sign a deal for the return at a nuclear
security summit next week in the Netherlands. Yet [Japan]{.underline} is
sending mixed signals. It [also has plans to open a new fast-breeder
plutonium reactor]{.underline} in Rokkasho in October. [The reactor
would be able to produce 8 tons of plutonium **a year**, or enough for
**1,000 Nagasaki-sized weapons**]{.underline}.

<http://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/ending-a-nuclear-threat-via-a-northeast-asia-nuclear-weapons-free-zone/>)

[Deterrence, compellence, and reassurance are credible depending on the
resolve and capability of the state projecting nuclear
threat]{.underline}, and the ability of the threatened state to respond
in kind or asymmetrically, to offset these threats. All three types of
effects are almost always present in a nuclear threat made by one party
to another; sometimes all three effects may be in play at the same time,
either in the intention of the state projecting nuclear threat, or in
the perception of the state that is the target of the threat, or in the
perceptions of third parties. [It is rare for the intentions and
perceptions of these two or more affected states to be the
same]{.underline}. [Therein lies much of the risk of misperception,
misunderstanding, and]{.underline} [**inadvertent escalation to nuclear

by the **accidental risks of nuclear war**]{.underline} [because of
**technical** or computer malfunctions,]{.underline} **[misinterpreted
signals of an impending attack]{.underline}**, **[problems in
communication]{.underline}** systems, **[problems in fail-safe and

**[fall under the shadow of the threat of nuclear war]{.underline}**.
Sometimes, this threat is intended, manipulated, and calibrated, by a
variety of signals---nuclear testing, delivery system testing, visible
transiting deployments, forward deployment in host countries,
declaratory doctrines, operational doctrines, political statements,
propaganda statements, sharing via deliberate open line communications,
or even what is not done or said at a particularly tense moment.
[Nuclear threat is]{.underline} [one of the bases of interstate
relations between]{.underline} the long-standing NWSs in this region,
**[the United States, China, and Russia,]{.underline}** [forming a
triangle of]{.underline} strategic nuclear [deterrence]{.underline},
compellence, and reassurance that operates continuously and generally;
and sometimes becomes part of an immediate confrontation. Accordingly,
these types of threat are termed general and immediate in western
literature.\[3\] Thus, general and strategic nuclear deterrence may be
said to operate to ensure that NWSs avoid actions that might suggest
that they could involve nuclear weapons and intentions to use
them---thereby creating a cautionary behavior that operates all the
time.

**Probability -- prolif causes sudden power shifts -- takes away other
checks on conflict**

(Stephen, "NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND DETERRENCE IN ASIA: THE VIEW FROM
VLADIVOSTOK," Journal of Slavic Military Studies, 20: 61--79)

Because [**even** small nuclear arsenals can **wreak devastating
havoc**]{.underline} on populations (even against defenses of high
competency), [they shrink the gap between "great" powers and
others]{.underline}. And not only the general public in states with
nuclear ground zeros is at risk: [so, too, are the heads of state and
military leaders of countries faced with the possibility of nuclear
attack]{.underline} or retaliation. [Nuclear weapons]{.underline} thus
[pose a]{.underline} personal [risk for **swaggering
politicians**]{.underline} and prospective Schlieffens [who mismanage
nuclear]{.underline} [brinkmanship]{.underline} **[into inadvertent
war.]{.underline}** [Nuclear weapons require rethinking of the
relationship between **structural factors** and the **likelihood of
war.**]{.underline}

**[Any reconsideration]{.underline}** [of Japan's policy of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [abstention would have significant implications
for]{.underline} U.S. policy in East Asia. Globally, [Japan's withdrawal
from the]{.underline} Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty ([NPT) **could
damage**]{.underline} [the most durable international]{.underline}
[non-prolif]{.underline}eration [regime]{.underline}. Regionally,
[Japan]{.underline} "going nuclear" [could set off a nuclear arms race
with **China**]{.underline}, **[South Korea]{.underline}**, and
**[Taiwan and]{.underline}**, in turn, **[India]{.underline}**, **[and
Pakistan]{.underline}** [may feel **compelled to further strengthen**
their own nuclear weapons capability]{.underline}. Bilaterally, assuming
that Japan made the decision without U.S. support, [the]{.underline}
[move could indicate **Tokyo's lack of trust** in the American
commitment **to defend Japan**]{.underline}. [An erosion in the
U.S.-Japan alliance could upset **the geopolitical balance in East
Asia,**]{.underline} [a shift that could indicate a **further
strengthening of China's position**]{.underline} as an emerging
hegemonic power. [These ramifications would]{.underline} likely [be
**deeply destabilizing**]{.underline} for the security of the Asia
Pacific region and beyond.

### Turns Iran 

#### Asian prolif spills over and ignites Iranian aggression---turns their Iran advantage

Scenario 2: Asian Nuclear Arms Race

[What would a **nuclear arms race in Asia** look like]{.underline} in
2020 or thereafter? If proliferation in Asia is successfully contained
or rolled back, by political or by military means, the threat of an arms
race declines and there is no need for speculation. However,
[if]{.underline} we assume a more pessimistic future in which
[proliferation is not contained]{.underline}, the third decade of [the
twenty-first century might witness]{.underline} **[an eight-sided
nuclear club of states in Asia]{.underline}** and/ **[or the Middle
East]{.underline}**, **[including Russia, China, Japan, North Korea,
South Korea, India, Pakistan, and Iran]{.underline}**, [with the ability
to contribute]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[nuclear
destabilization]{.underline}** [in Asia]{.underline} (other
possibilities for nuclear weapons proliferation exist, especially in the
aftermath of Iran becoming a declared and de facto nuclear weapons
state, led by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt). Although this scenario
does not contain proliferation, it does not automatically result in war.
The assumption that nuclear weapons can spread among these states
without war necessarily ensuing will be questioned by some, and with
some justification. For example, [the US has declared that an
Iranian]{.underline} or a North Korean [nuclear capability
is]{.underline} presently [unacceptable]{.underline}: [the former must
be prevented, and the latter]{.underline} must be [rolled
back]{.underline}. In addition, [some experts would]{.underline} surely
[argue that China would never accept a Japan armed with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. On the other hand, [the rollback of North Korea's
nuclear program is **far from a certainty**]{.underline}: a complicated
international bargaining process may leave the DPRK as a standing
nuclear power, with a trade-off including more glasnost on the part of
the regime, a willingness on the part of Pyongyang to adhere to some
international arms control agreements, and economic assistance from the
US and other powers to help rebuild North Korea's collapsed economy. As
for the Iranian nuclear case, [both Israel and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [have]{.underline}
obliquely [threatened preemption]{.underline} (presumably with
conventional weapons) [against Iran]{.underline}'s nuclear
infrastructure [and]{.underline} against [any]{.underline}
[nuclear]{.underline} capable military [forces]{.underline}, [but the
costs of carrying out the threat of preemption against Iran]{.underline}
[must be factored in]{.underline}to the equation.26 Unlike Iraq, **[Iran
is a large state and cannot be conquered and occupied]{.underline}** by
outside powers. Iran could also reconstruct any destroyed nuclear power
plants or other infrastructure. An additional consideration is
political: [any Israeli preemption against Iran becomes]{.underline}
**[a recruitment poster for another holy war by jihadists against
Israel]{.underline}**. [Iran is one of the **major sponsors of
Hizbollah**]{.underline} and other groups that have carried out past
terror attacks in Israel. [An Israeli preemption against Tehran
might]{.underline} therefore **[spark a new conflagration]{.underline}**
or otherwise destabilize the peace process.

[**crucial backstops** for Japan's commitments]{.underline} [to
nonproliferation and disarmament]{.underline}. [**Without them**, a
nuclear arms race could ensue in East Asia]{.underline}. [If Japan
pursued nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [it would upend efforts to
restrict their spread]{.underline}, especially in East Asia. With the
largest nuclear program of any state outside the 9-member nuclear club,
[Japan has]{.underline} long [been a **poster child** for
nonproliferation]{.underline}. Besides its NPT membership, [it
accepts]{.underline} the [safeguards of the]{.underline}
[I]{.underline}nternational [A]{.underline}tomic [E]{.underline}nergy
[A]{.underline}gency --- the global nuclear watchdog ---
[on]{.underline} activities ranging from [uranium imports to plutonium
reprocessing]{.underline}. In 1998, [it was the first to [sign
up](https://www.iaea.org/safeguards/safeguards-legal-framework/additional-protocol/status-of-additional-protocol)
for the]{.underline} IAEA's voluntary [Additional Protocol]{.underline},
[which mandated]{.underline} even more [comprehensive and onerous
inspections]{.underline} after the first Gulf War. The Japanese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs
[touts](http://www.mofa.go.jp/dns/ac_d/page24e_000080.html) nuclear
disarmament, and officials of its Arms Control and Disarmament Division
toil abroad in support of international efforts to manage and eventually
eliminate weapons of mass destruction. These attitudes and behaviors are
[often](http://www.ugapress.org/index.php/books/nonproliferation_norms)
ascribed to the bombs' enduring impact on Japanese culture and politics.
An [estimated](http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/MED/med_chp10.shtml)
66,000 people were killed and 69,000 injured in Hiroshima, and another
39,000 and 25,000 in Nagasaki --- in all, 250,000 to 300,000 died within
13 years. During the 7-year U.S. occupation of Japan, U.S. authorities
censored accounts of the bombings and its radioactive aftereffects on
the cities' populations. Anti-nuclear sentiment flared again after an
American H-bomb test went awry in 1954, contaminating 7000 square miles
of the South Pacific and irradiating 23 crew members of a Japanese
fishing vessel --- the Lucky Dragon --- one of whom later died from
radiation poisoning. The incident gave rise to public outcry and
anti-nuclear protests in Japan and was featured in the godfather of all
monster movies --- Godzilla. One year later, Japan's parliament, the
Diet, restricted domestic nuclear activities to those with civilian
uses, a norm which Prime Minister Eisaku Sato further reinforced in
1967, when
he[introduced](https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLvr20u-PUC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=three+principles:+non-possession,+non-manufacture,+and+non-introduction+of+nuclear+weapons.&source=bl&ots=alObSfhsR2&sig=-_TjQTUIKDMcYyQEkCOB6m863S8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI896n8vOPxwIVkBuOCh3GRg6D#v=onepage&q=three%20principles%3A%20non-possession%2C%20non-manufacture%2C%20and%20non-introduction%20of%20nuclear%20weapons.&f=false)
his Three Non-Nuclear Principles: non-possession, non-manufacture, and
non-introduction of nuclear weapons. Yet [Japanese leaders' renunciation
of nuclear weapons has **never been absolute**]{.underline}.
[In]{.underline} private [remarks]{.underline}, many of Japan's [prime
ministers]{.underline} in the 1950s and 1960s
[[asserted]{.underline}](http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=705)
that the [weapons would enhance]{.underline} their country's [national
security and international standing]{.underline}. (This was partly a
mark of the era, when President Dwight Eisenhower
[insisted](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=10434) that he saw "no
reason why \[nuclear weapons\] shouldn't be used just exactly as you
would use a bullet or anything else.") After China's first nuclear test
in 1964, Sato
[informed](https://books.google.com/books?id=Dg5nEk7YNscC&pg=PA222&lpg=PA222&dq=had+nuclear+weapons,+the+Japanese+should+have+them+sato&source=bl&ots=ixSyXhELxe&sig=3jPyk1vD4XbixGQUnh5r5nLI0Mw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAmoVChMImvnM-oGLxwIVxo8NCh0kFgmD#v=onepage&q=had%20nuclear%20weapons%2C%20the%20Japanese%20should%20have%20them%20sato&f=false)
U.S. President Lyndon Johnson "that if the \[Chinese\] had nuclear
weapons, the Japanese also should have them." He later
[confided](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v29p2/d140)
to the U.S. ambassador to Japan U. Alexis Johnson that the Three
Non-Nuclear Principles were "nonsense." [Why then did Japan not build
atomic bombs in the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}? Mainly [because
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[offered to share]{.underline} its own. Security treaties signed in 1952
and 1960 granted the U.S. military basing rights in exchange for
protecting Japan. Those treaties were silent on nuclear threats,
however, so after China's nuclear test, Johnson and his foreign-policy
team devised various schemes to make U.S. atom and hydrogen bombs
available to Japan amid a crisis. In January 1965, [Johnson
[inaugurated](https://books.google.com/books?id=psarwscR_48C&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=if+Japan+needs+our+nuclear+deterrent+for+its+defense,+the+United+States+would+stand+by+its+commitments+and+provide+that+defense.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=6zjs_hbXpy&sig=c0n-AnlNVoWJDDvWTeEdmkQNNTQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI_o6LyIKLxwIVjNCACh2KzgLe#v=onepage&q=if%20Japan%20needs%20our%20nuclear%20deterrent%20for%20its%20defense%2C%20the%20United%20States%20would%20stand%20by%20its%20commitments%20and%20provide%20that%20defense.%E2%80%9D&f=false)

to Japanese prime ministers, "[if Japan needs]{.underline} our [nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} for its defense, [the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would stand by its
commitments and provide]{.underline} [that defense]{.underline}." [These
reassurances]{.underline} seemed to [have their intended
effect]{.underline}. In 1967, Sato acknowledged the importance of
extended nuclear deterrence in a meeting with Secretary of State Dean
Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara: "[The Japanese were
well-protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella]{.underline}, and Japan had
no intention to make nuclear weapons," he [told
them](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v29p2/d104).
Afterward, [Sato]{.underline} [announced]{.underline} [that extended
nuclear deterrence]{.underline} also [formed a pillar of Japan's nuclear
posture]{.underline}. When Sato's former Foreign Minister Takeo
[Miki]{.underline} became prime minister in 1974, he [convinced the Diet
to ratify Japan's acceptance of the NPT]{.underline}, [thanks
to]{.underline} President Gerald [Ford's]{.underline}

[that the U.S.-Japan security treaty encompassed nuclear
threats]{.underline} and the establishment of the Subcommittee on
U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation, where the two countries' foreign and
defense ministers would thereafter meet to coordinate their common
defense. [Optimists claim that [nuclear

[political

[international commitments](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8554.html)
will prevent a Japanese nuclear breakout]{.underline} in the future.
After all, Foreign Minister Fumio [Kishida]{.underline} --- who hails

Hiroshima and Nagasaki in order [to "witness]{.underline} with their own

**increasingly ambivalent** about its military restraint]{.underline}.
Before his speech in New York, [Kishida]{.underline}

[Japan's possession of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, however, [is

interpretation is that Article 9.2 of the constitution does not prohibit
the possession of force that is within the minimum range necessary for
self-defense]{.underline}.2 Therefore, [if the weapon in question,
**whether conventional or nuclear**, is within these bounds, it is not
constitutionally banned. If thus confined to the minimum necessary level
for self-defense, **the possession of nuclear weapons is considered
constitutional for Japan**.]{.underline} Here it should be noted that
the minimum necessary level applies to the limit of individual
self-defense and does not include collective self-defense in the
government's interpretation of the constitution.

The significance of the argument in the report that [Seoul can **build
dozens of nuclear bombs in a short time period** because it is capable
of making and transporting nuclear warheads]{.underline} and [its
nuclear reactors already have enough plutonium to make such
weapons]{.underline} cannot be taken lightly as such claims came after
South Korea and the US struck a deal over the revision of their 1974
nuclear cooperation agreement on April 22. [The deal opens the door for
Seoul to expand its commercial use of nuclear energy]{.underline} in
accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation (of Nuclear Weapons)
Treaty (NPT). In that case, [Seoul may violate the NPT and consider
joining the **nuclear arms race** if it determines that Pyongyang's
nuclear threat reaches a level which Washington and Beijing cannot
control.]{.underline} The report claims Japan's possible attempt to
acquire nuclear weapons may trigger Seoul to develop such weapons on its
own. But the argument also can go the other way that [Seoul's decision
to acquire nuclear weapons may **precipitate a decision in Tokyo** to
acquire some of them on its own as well. It does not matter if spent
fuel or enriched uranium is used to build nuclear bombs as long as their
devastative potentials are in their possession]{.underline}. Seoul won
the right to deal with spent nuclear fuel, secure a stable supply of
nuclear fuel and promote the export of nuclear power plants in its
agreement with the US on April 22.The two sides also agreed to lift the
"gold standard" that legally binds US partners not to perform uranium
enrichment and reprocessing. [The]{.underline} revised [Seoul-Washington
nuclear cooperation]{.underline} deal [allows Seoul to secure long-term
advance consent from Washington to conduct the early stages of
"pyroprocessing]{.underline}." Though the report also expressed concern
that Seoul may exploit "pyroprocessing," an experimental process for
recycling spent fuel, to make nuclear weapons, Korean scholars rubbish
to such possibility. According to a scholar at the Sejong Institute, "it
is generally perceived that pyroprocessing has less chance of being
converted into a program to produce nuclear weapons because it leaves
separated plutonium mixed with other elements." He further argues that
"South Korea's export-dependent economy will suffer heavily if the
international community imposes economic sanctions as punitive measures
for developing nuclear weapons[."]{.underline}

**They can [quickly]{.underline} develop it**

**Ferguson, 15** -- President of the Federation of American Scientists,
(Charles D., "HOW SOUTH KOREA COULD ACQUIRE AND DEPLOY NUCLEAR WEAPONS,"
<http://npolicy.org/books/East_Asia/Ch4_Ferguson.pdf>)

Let's consider three scenarios that would lend South Korea the means to
deter, counter, and respond to nuclear threats. The first scenario will
be called "enhanced status quo" because it will show that [the current
status quo has already resulted in South Korea having **delivery
systems** such as missiles and aircraft for nuclear weapons
and]{.underline} having [a]{.underline} relatively [large civilian
nuclear infrastructure that would only need to be enhanced a bit to
provide]{.underline} the means to extract [fissile material for
weapons]{.underline} and deploy the first nuclear weapons on available
delivery systems. This scenario posits that [South Korea would first
stockpile separated reactor-grade, but still weapons-usable,
plutonium]{.underline} (Pu) [and proceed with enhancing its means to
produce larger quantities of weapons-grade]{.underline} or
near-weapons-grade [plutonium for a potential major
breakout]{.underline} if necessary. In parallel to the initial amassing
of separated plutonium, [the ROK would continue to improve its ballistic
and cruise missile systems]{.underline} and perform development and
testing to ensure that these systems are nuclear capable. [Once South
Korea has at least a few bombs' worth of plutonium and]{.underline} has
[confidence in its missile systems, it could go for a **quick
breakout**]{.underline} that would most likely be [used to signal North
Korea, China, Japan, and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
One plausible purpose of this signaling of these initial "diplomatic"
bombs would be to prod Washington as well as Beijing to engage seriously
on the denuclearization of North Korea.

Sales to Taiwan, <https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/taiwanarms>) PA

During his first term in office, President [Barack Obama has sought to
reduce the visibility U.S. arms sales to Taiwan by providing new three
arms packages, while simultaneously refusing to approve a deal to
provide Taiwan with new fighter jets,]{.underline} the most contenious
issue for China. Instead, the administration has offered to upgrade
Taipei\'s existing fleet of F-16 fighters, rather than approve a deal
that would provide Taiwan with 66 new F-16 fighters. This upgrade
agreement is in addition to the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, P-3C
Orion maritime patrol planes and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 air
defense systems provided to Taipei as a part of the Obama
administration\'s three [arms packages to Taiwan]{.underline} since
entering into office in January 2008. The Obama administration [has
suffered bipartisan criticism from Congress a result of both their

**[The latest US arms sales to Taiwan have not only drawn sharp protests
from the Chinese government but also criticism from experts on China-US
relations.]{.underline}** US President Barack Obama signed the Naval
Vessel Transfer Act on Thursday to pave the way for the US government to
sell four used Perry-class guided missile frigates to Taiwan. It was
Taiwan\'s first purchase of US-made military equipment in three years.
**[Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Friday that the
Chinese government has lodged a formal protest to the US in Beijing and
Washington, and that China reserves the right for further actions. \"The
Taiwan question concerns China\'s core interest and remains the
important and sensitive issue in China-US relations,\"]{.underline}**
Qin said. **[\"The Chinese side is firmly opposed to the arms sales by
the US to Taiwan. The position is steadfast, clear and
consistent.\"]{.underline}** He said the US action was \"brutally
interfering in China\'s domestic affairs and undermines China\'s
sovereignty and security interests\". \"It goes against the trend of
peaceful development of the cross-Straits relations,\" he said. **[Qin
urged the US to stop official interactions and military exchanges with
Taiwan, stop selling arms to Taiwan and do more that is conducive to the
overall interests of China-US relations and the peaceful development of
cross-Straits relations.]{.underline}** Chinese Ministry of Defense
spokesman also made a similar protest. Geng described the US action as
going against the good momentum of current China-US military-to-military
relations. The two countries have witnessed growing military exchanges
in the past years with high-level visits and joint exercises, including
China participating for the first time in the US-led Rim of the Pacific
(RIMPAC) naval exercise this summer. China has long regarded US arms
sales to Taiwan, the US\' frequent close-in surveillance along China\'s
coast and the US Congress laws restricting military exchanges with China
as three major stumbling blocks for developing bilateral
military-to-military ties. The four frigates to be sold to Taiwan this
time are the USS Taylor, USS Gary, USS Carr and USS Elrod, commissioned
in 1984 and 1985. Many Chinese have questioned why the US would make
such a move at a time when cross-Straits relations are believed by many
to be at their best in decades. **[Zha Daojiong, professor at the School
of International Studies of Peking University, told China
Daily]{.underline}** on Sunday that **[the announcement of the arms
sales can cause many to wonder if the Obama administration is
backpedaling in pursuing ties with China.]{.underline}** Zha said that
while Beijing should not see the sales as unexpected, as Washington can
refer to its \"gradual phase out\" clause in a 1982 bilateral agreement,
the timing is not good only weeks after Obama had a productive visit to
Beijing. **[Obama visited Beijing last month during which the two
countries reached important agreements]{.underline}** on climate change,
military confidence building, visa extension and expansion of an
information technology agreement. . **[\"Was it because Washington saw
an opportunity to exploit a sense of uncertainty in cross-Straits ties
after the loss of KMT in local elections in Taiwan?\"]{.underline}** Zha
asked. **[Zha said the move does \"not bode well for those in the
(Chinese) mainland that prefer to see Washington working with Beijing to
enlarge areas of cooperation and minimize geostrategic
suspicions.\"]{.underline}** Zhiqun Zhu, a professor of political
science and international relations at Bucknell University, also said
the timing of the announcement is \"unfortunate and suspicious\". \"With
its landslide victory in Taiwan\'s municipal and local elections, the
DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) is aiming to take full control of the
government in the 2016 election. Is the US sending some message to the
DPP or the timing is just a coincidence?\" Zhu said to China Daily on
Sunday.

**China is an essential part of congressional calculus---they've caused
Congress to block policy in fighter jet sales**

[No president since George H.W. Bush has approved the sale of
advanced]{.underline} fighter [jets to Taiwan, and even that approval
came under very specific circumstances.]{.underline} When Bush approved
the sale of 150 F-16 A/B fighters to Taiwan, it was almost entirely a
ploy to increase his domestic approval ratings ahead of the 1992
presidential election. Bush had faced severe criticism over his handling
of U.S.-China relations in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square
violence in 1989. Selling advanced fighters to Taiwan was a way of
contradicting Bill Clinton's accusations that Bush was coddling "the
butchers of Beijing." Further, as James Mann argued in his book *About
Face*, the sale of F-16 A/B fighters was also immensely profitable for
General Dynamics (the F-16 manufacturer), and created nearly 6,000 new
jobs during an economic downturn. In other words, the last sale of U.S.
fighters to Taiwan was dictated by a unique confluence of U.S. domestic
politics --- a scenario unlikely to be repeated. It's not a coincidence
that the U.S. hasn't sold fighters to Taiwan in over 20 years. Instead,
[presidents have opted for less controversial measures, such as the 2011
agreement to]{.underline} [[upgrade Taiwan's existing
fleet](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/world/asia/us-decides-against-selling-f-16s-to-taiwan.html)
of F-16 A/B fighters. Taiwan's military has decried this as
inadequate]{.underline} --- arguing, for example, that the program will
not address the root problem of [declining fleet
numbers](http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120722/DEFREG03/307220001/Taiwan-Remains-Irked-Despite-F-16-Upgrade-Deal?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE)
--- but [their complaints are never enough to sway the U.S. government.
Neither is congressional pressure]{.underline}, which also remains a
consistent voice in favor of selling fighters to Taiwan. In 2011,
Senator Robert Menendez (Chairman of Senate Taiwan Caucus) and 45 other
senators[wrote a
letter](http://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-urges-president-obama-to-expedite-sale-of-military-aircraft-to-taiwan)
urging Obama to expedite the sale of F-16 C/D aircraft to Taiwan. A few
months later, the [Obama administration disregarded]{.underline} [this
advice and chose (yet again) not to approve such a sale. Taiwan's
official request for F-16 C/D aircraft has now been pending for nearly
eight years.]{.underline} Like it or not[, China remains an essential
part of the United States' calculus when it comes to arms sales to
Taiwan.]{.underline} Beijing has made it clear, time and time again,
that this single issue has the most potential to disrupt the U.S.-China
relationship. A [major policy
paper](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zmgxss/t954603.htm) written in
2012 by Cui Tiankai (now the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S.) and Pang
Hanzhao called Taiwan "the most important and most sensitive issue in
the \[sic\] China-US relations." Xi Jinping himself [reportedly
asked](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/06/10/2003564416)
the U.S. to cease arms sales to Taiwan during his informal summit with
Barack Obama in June 2013. Ever since Nixon made his overtures to China
in the early 1970s, the U.S. has played a balancing act, trying to keep
its defense commitments to Taiwan while not scuttling U.S.-China
relations. History is full of examples of this tight-rope walk. The
announcement of the normalization of U.S.-PRC relations in 1979 was
closely followed by the passage of the 1979 [Taiwan Relations
Act](http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=393&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1),
which promised (among other things) "to provide Taiwan with arms of a
defensive character." [Under President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. issued
the [1982 joint
communique](http://www.ait.org.tw/en/us-joint-communique-1982.html)with
China, which famously promised that U.S. arms sale to Taiwan "will not
exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of
those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic
relations."]{.underline} The same year, however, the U.S. government
also offered the "[six
assurances](http://www.taiwandocuments.org/assurances.htm)" to Taiwan,
promising that the U.S. would not set a date for ending arms sales to
Taiwan and would not consult with China prior to making decisions about
arms sales. Each pair of diplomatic decisions seems contradictory, but
for better or worse this was the U.S.'s way of maintaining a balance
between Taiwan and China. [There is no reason to think the U.S.
government is ready to depart from this policy by selling F-35s to
Taiwan. Even in the mid-1990s, President Clinton (who came to office
partly on an anti-China platform) avoided selling fighters to Taiwan ---
and at that time, China was far less important to the U.S., both
politically and economically, than it is now.]{.underline}

**Ending security assistance to Taiwan costs political capital --
alienates powerful Taiwan supporters and poisons domestic politics**

[Ending US defense assistance to Taiwan]{.underline}---whether by
repealing the Taiwan Relations Act or by simply declining to provide
defensive equipment to Taiwan's armed forces---would not "ripen" Taiwan
for peaceful unification or obviate the rationale the United States has
historically followed regarding Taiwan. It [would,]{.underline} however,
**[intensify the debate over Taiwan policy within the United
States]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan still has many US friends and

changes]{.underline} Gilley, Glaser, Freeman, and Owens recommend [would
stimulate a debate over China policy at a time **when negative attitudes
toward the PRC already are on the rise**]{.underline}. The last thing
Sino-American relations need is an acrimonious, politically charged
debate in Washington over policy toward China and Taiwan. In sum,

Overall, [congressional oversight ensures the president's adherence to
the Taiwan Relations Act, enacted in 1979. In addition, Congress
uniquely acts as guarantor in the U.S. government to maintain the Six
Assurances that President Ronald Reagan offered to Taiwan in
1982]{.underline}.3 [Many members see shared interests between the
United States and Taiwan, a fellow democracy, and have issued statements
and taken actions supporting closer engagement with the
island]{.underline}. [When the Trump administration notified Congress of
arms sales to Taiwan in June 2017, Senators Bob Menendez (the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) and James Inhofe
(the second-highest ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, after the chairman John McCain) issued a bipartisan statement
as co-chairs of the Senate Taiwan Caucus]{.underline}. [They expressed
support for the arms sales as promoting U.S. interests in a peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan question and a strong, vibrant, and democratic
Taiwan.4 In a bipartisan letter to President Donald Trump]{.underline}
before his visit to Beijing in November 2017, which Taiwan feared would
result in a deal at its expense, [Representatives Ed Royce and Eliot
Engel (the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee) reminded the president that the United States
and Taiwan "have fostered a close relationship that has been of
significant strategic and economic benefit to both nations; and our two
peoples are bound by shared values of democracy, human rights, and rule
of law."5]{.underline} Likewise, [in December 2017,]{.underline} after a
PRC diplomat threatened Taiwan, [Senator Tom Cotton promptly issued a
statement in which he countered, "I take Beijing's threats to use
military force against Taiwan seriously. That's why I urge both the
president and Congress to accelerate the sale of defensive weapons to
Taiwan, as well as to bring Taiwan into joint military exercises with
the United States. We can't afford to take Beijing's saber-rattling
lightly."6 In February 2018, Senator Inhofe led a delegation of the
Senate and House Armed Services Committees to visit Taiwan and other
partners. Inhofe expressed U.S. support for Taiwan: "With China becoming
more aggressive and intent on expanding its influence globally, the
United States--Taiwan security relationship is now more important than
ever."7 The congressional delegation met with Taiwan's president Tsai
Ing-wen and senior ministers.]{.underline}
