While this film has been characterized as a cinematic masterpiece, it
greatly advanced the aims of White Supremacy. In particular, this film
had a deleterious effect on African American males because they were
depicted as brutes whose sole intent in life was to rape White women and
destroy the White man's way of life (Loewen, 2007). [As an effective Ku
Klux Klan recruitment tool, this film galvanized support for the Klan as
the preeminent savior of White southern civilization. So far-reaching
was the negative effects of this movie for African American people,
during a private White House screening by-then President Woodrow Wilson,
he reportedly described the film as painting an accurate portrait of
African Americans]{.underline} (Loewen, 2007). In short, this film was a
catalyst for most of the early 20th century media caricatures of African
Americans that still exist today (Baker, 1996; Menzel- Baker, Motley, &
Henderson, 2004). The aforementioned images of African Americans have
contributed to what Armour (1997) calls **[[Negrophobia, or an
irrational fear of African Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
irrational fear **[[has contributed to Whites' general desensitization
to African American suffering of all types as well as decreased support
for social safety nets. Thus, African American males are devalued and
seen as expendable]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Burrell, 2010).
Unfortunately, **[[Black as a metaphor for criminality is so deeply
embedded in the minds of societal members that Whites have reported
seeing an African American criminal suspect at the scene of a crime when
none was actually present]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Chaney & Robertson,
2013b; Leverentz, 2012; Oliver & Fonash, 2002). In a study to determine
the effect of network news images on viewer perceptions, Dixon (2008)
found that exposure to network news depressed estimates of African
American income, increased the endorsement of stereotypes of African
Americans as poor and intimidating, and were associated with higher
racism scores**[. Media characterizations of violent criminals as Black
has been deeply etched in the psyche of many viewers]{.underline}**
(Dixon & Maddox, 2005; Leverentz, 2012; Oliver & Fonash, 2002; Oliver,
Jackson, Moses, & Dangerfield, 2004). **[Such]{.underline}** negative
**[portrayals]{.underline}** of African Americans in media **[have
resulted in wanton stereotyping, extreme fear of African Americans, and
African Americans with darker complexions and more Afrocentric
phenotypic features being perceived as more worthy of the death penalty
in research experiments]{.underline}** (Blair, Judd, & Chapleau 2004;
Chaney & Robertson, 2013b; Dixon, 2008; Eberhardt, Davies,
Purdie-Vaughns, & Johnson, 2006; Maddox & Gray, 2002; Peffley & Hurwitz,
2013). All of **[[the aforementioned serve to legitimize White
supremacy]{.mark}, legitimize White life, [and de-legitimize African
American life]{.mark} so that incidents of police violence against
African Americans are not punished nor viewed as a larger societal
problem.]{.underline}**

#### We protest and dem white folks try to make it seem like our protest ain't do shit, tryna stop us from fighting for freedom, shit we aint letting that happen, dem motherfuckers use their big ass guns to shoot us down like it aint nuthin, Money-hungry companies that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in the hood, making bloody clothes, dem bullets hit a young boy with a snotty nose.

[The issues of [**police militarization** and
the]{.mark} disproportionate [use of force
against]{.mark} historically [**disadvantaged racial groups** are
inextricably]{.mark} [**linked**.]{.mark} The goal here is to provide
insight into the origins of **domestic police militarization**. To do
so, we build on our previous work to discuss how proactive [U]{.mark}.S.
foreign policy generates **undesirable domestic consequences**, which
threaten the liberties and **freedoms** of U.S.
citizens. ]{.underline}In the context of police militarization[, past
foreign military interventions **led directly to the militarization of
U.S. police**. The undesirableconsequences have
fallen **disproportionately on minorities** ]{.underline}and
disadvantaged groups[. The main takeaway is that a proactive,
imperialistic foreign policy can impose significant costs on domestic
citizens due to expansions in the scope of state
power. ]{.underline}Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams are police
units possessing highly specialized military equipment and training.
These groups have become a fixture in many police departments in the
United States. In the mid-1980s, approximately 20 percent of police
departments had a SWAT team. By the year 2000, nearly 90 percent of
police departments serving populations of 50,000 or more had a SWAT
team. An estimated 3,000 SWAT deployments occurred in 1980. By the early
2000s, SWAT teams deployed 45,000 times every year. Current estimates
place the number of SWAT deployments as high as 80,000 annually.
Although now common[, [SWAT teams are a relatively new
innovation]{.mark}, one [that can be directly **tied to U.S. foreign
intervention**]{.mark} ]{.underline}and to two combat veterans, former
Los Angeles police chief and World War II veteran Daryl Gates and former
Los Angeles police officer and Marine John Nelson[.]{.underline} As a
Marine, Nelson served in Vietnam in an elite Force Recon unit. Although
originally designed to gather intelligence, these Force Recon teams saw
extended combat and were recognized for their use of lethal force. They
became well known for being experts at skillfully eliminating enemy
targets. For example, the \"kill ratio,\" or number of enemies killed
per every soldier lost, was about 7.6 enemies per Marine for regular
Marine infantries during the Vietnam War. The kill ratio for the Force
Recon units, meanwhile, was about 34 enemies for every man lost in
action. The Force Recon units were also more aggressive. Regular Marine
units were the aggressors in combat only 20 percent of the time they saw
action. The Force Recon teams, in contrast, were the aggressors in an
astounding 95 percent of their operations. Stated differently, the Force
Recon units were trained to gather information, engage enemy combatants,
and kill. They did so efficiently. These experiences were integral in
developing John Nelson\'s skills, knowledge, and abilities regarding
methods for controlling large groups, gathering information, and
eliminating enemies. He brought this unique human capital with him when
he returned to the United States and joined the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD). In the 1960s, Nelson was presented an opportunity to
use the unique skills of social control that he had developed abroad. In
1965, racial tensions set off the Watts riots in Los Angeles. The riots
left the LAPD feeling unprepared. In response to the perceived crisis
surrounding the riots, leaders of the LAPD were anxious to develop new
ways to effectively control the large crowds regularly in attendance at
race rallies. Drawing from his experiences with the Force Recon team,
Nelson suggested the development of a similar unit within the LAPD. \"A
small squad of highly trained police officers armed with special
weapons,\" he suggested, \"would be more effective in a riotous
situation than a massive police response.\" To take effect, however,
Nelson\'s idea would need administrative support. It was here that
Inspector (later Police Chief) Daryl Gates was essential. Like Nelson,
Gates was a veteran of foreign conflict, serving aboard the USS Ault
during World War II. And like Nelson, Gates returned home from war with
a unique skill set and had joined the LAPD. By the time Nelson proposed
his idea, individuals like Gates had successfully worked their way into
the administration of the LAPD. The presence of war veterans created an
administrative and cultural openness to the use of military tactics. In
fact, Gates himself wanted the LAPD be more militaristic and
\"aggressive, intimidating, and confrontational by design.\" It was
within this environment that Nelson proposed the idea of a Force Recon
style unit within the LAPD. With Gates\' support, Nelson\'s idea was
quickly adopted. The link between the newly formed paramilitary unit and
the ongoing war in Vietnam was readily apparent. Initially called the
\"Special Weapons and Attack Team,\" it was decided that the word
\"attack\" was politically unpalatable. Gates subsequently changed the
name to \"Special Weapons and Tactics\" and the first SWAT team was
born. The first SWAT unit consisted of 60 of the LAPD\'s top marksmen
divided into teams consisting of five men---a leader, marksman,
observer, scout, and a rearguard. The men selected for the first SWAT
team further illustrate how the skills developed in foreign intervention
influenced domestic police operations. According to the LAPD, each
member of the original SWAT unit had specialized experience and prior
military service. Moreover, the new SWAT team continued to incorporate
new military tactics in counterinsurgency and guerrilla warfare, hiring
military personnel to teach the SWAT unit. The use of SWAT teams
throughout the country expanded rapidly as a result of [[the War on
Drugs and War on Terror. ]{.underline}]{.mark}As we have written
previously, these conflicts[ [served as **catalysts** to spread
police militarization as **local police departments** became intertwined
with the federal government\'s efforts to combat drugs and
terror.]{.mark} ]{.underline}This relationship between the political
periphery (state and local governments) and the political center (the
national government) allowed for the expansion of SWAT operations
through the transfer of military-grade equipment and training. For
example, the DOD 1208 Program, implemented in 1990, allowed the
Department of Defense to transfer military equipment, such as aircraft,
armor, watercraft, and weapons, to state and local police to use in
their efforts to combat drugs. In 2013, a successor
program[, **Program** [**1033**, transferred]{.mark} almost [\$500
million in military weapons]{.mark} and gear [to domestic law
enforcement agencies for]{.mark} the purposes of [**fighting drugs and
terror**. The **influx of military equipment** into local law
enforcement, combined with the **adoption of military tactics** like
those employed by SWAT teams, created an arena in which]{.mark} the
liberties and [freedoms]{.mark} of U.S.
citizens [were **jeopardized**. Those most likely to suffer]{.mark} from
these changes [were those least likely to have the means
to **avoid** the enhanced coercive power of the state---the
poor]{.mark}, politically
unconnected, [and]{.mark} historically **[marginalized]{.mark}** groups. ]{.underline}Just
as racial minorities are more likely to die while in police custody, so
too are SWAT teams more likely to be used against minority groups.
According to a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU), SWAT raids primarily impact persons of color. Between 2011 and
2012, approximately 50 percent of all SWAT raids were conducted against
Black or Hispanic individuals while only 20 percent of raids involved
white suspects. The difference is more pronounced when looking at
particular types of SWAT raids. For example, some 68 percent of drug
raids studied by the ACLU were conducted against minority suspects
compared to a much lower rate for whites, even though rates of drug use
and selling are similar across racial groups. In some localities, Blacks
and Latinos are much more likely to be impacted by SWAT raids than their
white counterparts. In Allentown, Pennsylvania, for example, Latinos are
29 times more likely to be affected by a SWAT raid than whites, while
Blacks are 23 times more likely. Blacks are 37 times more likely to be
the victim of a SWAT raid in Huntington, West Virginia, than their white
counterparts. Blacks in Ogden, Utah, are 39 times more likely to be
subjected to a SWAT raid and Blacks in Burlington, North Carolina, are
47 times more likely as compared to whites. The question remains why
such groups are more likely to be disproportionally affected by police
militarization. Albert Hirschman offers one explanation[. He argues
that [individuals are faced with **two options** when they confront
problems within ]{.mark}organizations to which they belong,
including [governments]{.mark}. First, [individuals may
\"**exit,\"**]{.mark}** or withdraw** from [the
relationship.]{.mark} Alternatively, [they can \"**voice\" their
grievances** in an attempt to address and **repair** the problem. For
those groups most]{.mark} likely to be adversely [affected by police
militarization]{.mark}, however, [both of these options may
be]{.mark} weak or [altogether nonexistent for a variety of
reasons.]{.mark} For many, **exiting a community** where police
militarization is prevalent may be **unviable** due to financial
constraints. Consider that Hispanics are more than **twice** as likely,
and Blacks almost **three times** more likely, to live in deep poverty
as whites. ]{.underline}Given these circumstances,[ the option to exit
is not feasible for many. As a result, these individuals become **even
more** **vulnerable** to state tools of social
control. ]{.underline}There is reason to believe that the \"voice\"
mechanism is also weak for racial minorities[. One study,]{.underline}
for instance[, foundthat **increased racial segregation leads to a
decrease in black civic efficacy**. The authors note
that relatively segregated black communities are often represented by
politicians who **fail to vote** for policies favored by black
constituents. Ferguson illustrates this concept well. [While 67 percent
of residents are black, there are nearly **no Black political
figures**.]{.mark} ]{.underline}Taken together, the lack of voice and
exit opportunities means that[ minority groups are often the least able
to avoid the **adverse costs** and consequences of militarized police
forces. [**Foreign and domestic policies** are ]{.mark}often [seen
as ]{.mark}distinct and [separate. In reality]{.mark},
however, [a]{.mark} proactive [foreign policy]{.mark} (i.e., [military
intervention) generates **unseen domestic** costs, including the
importation of techniques, methods, and tools of **state-produced social
control**.]{.mark} The militarization of domestic policing is one
illustration of how innovations in social control developed through
foreign interventions can **boomerang back to the
homeland**. ]{.underline}When these innovations return home they lower
the cost for the political elite of exerting control over the domestic
populace. [The costs of these expanded powers often fall
disproportionally on those least able to move or effectively voice their
dissatisfaction with government behaviors. [What can
be]{.mark} [done? Changing the status quo requires a **fundamental
reconsideration** of the]{.mark} scope and scale of [government by U.S.
citizens. Instead of]{.mark} [remaining **passive**]{.mark} regarding
the role of the state in their daily lives, [citizens must
become **skeptical** regarding]{.mark} the net benefits of the
projection of [state power, both **domestically and
abroad**.]{.mark} This is especially important for minority and
marginalized groups who are least able to avoid the abusive hand of the
state. Unfortunately, many U.S. citizens currently view the state as a
solution to their problems when in fact it is a contributing cause to
many economic, political, and social ills.]{.underline}

Lives Matter and the Limits of Formal Black Politics,\" The South
Atlantic Quarterly 116:3 2017)NAE

Giorgio [Agamben's]{.underline} (1998: 10--11) [discussion of "bare
life" as reflecting not so much basic biological life but the premise of
political life that reveals a condition to which "we are all potentially
exposed" helps in unraveling the intimacies between modern democratic
governance and totalitarian rule,]{.underline} although his turn to the
Nazi camp as the paradigmatic example of the moment of collapse elides
the very modes of coloniality that remain unre- marked in his thinking.
I will return to this point of Agamben's thinking later. What I want to
highlight here is that [the declaration "Black lives matter" echoes a
longer-running commentary on, and a rejection of, the protocols of
sovereign rule, where thinking about the exception presents colonialism,
plantation slavery, and genocidal violence in Africa, the Americas, and
India as long-standing features of the modern.]{.underline} From this
tradition of black thought, we can see the state of exception not as
something arrived at and thus not a state of exception at all. Rather,
it appears as something akin to what Achille Mbembe (2001: 29--30) calls
a régime d'exception, where [there is not so much a departure from but
an absence of common law, where [political rule is designed merely to
command subjects, rather than negotiate with citizens within a context
of consensual governance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such a setting, [there
is no regard for the means by which the modern, the rulers who command,
upon encountering their constitutive other, generally in various "states
of nature," might bring about their civilization. For Mbembe, this
involves a collapsing of the means and ends of rule as civilizing,
which, as others have noted of modernity, may necessarily entail
violence.]{.underline} We are therefore confronted with the question of
[what forms of black politics and political thought open up to us if we
view an emergency as representing less the bringing about of an
exception than that which illuminates an already operative
exception.]{.underline} To draw on Walter Benjamin's (1968: 257)
observation that "[[the tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the
'state of emergency' in which we live is not the exception but the
rule]{.mark},"]{.underline} what insights might we gain by viewing
Ferguson, Baltimore, and Milwaukee as issuing from a tradition for which
the paradigmatic emergency was a prior, longer-standing reality? What if
[these [protests reflect a form of political discourse largely
unintelligible to black elites and the larger political
structures,]{.mark} for whom this is merely lawlessness and rioting, yet
still one whose perspectives insist,]{.underline} if we can follow
Benjamin a bit further, that we "attain to a con- ception of history
that is in keeping with this insight" (257)? It seems that it is
primarily in thinking through black political thought that we find the
conceptual tools for addressing these questions. Head, Apologies, and
Apologia In discussing the problem of the human in contemporary critical
thought, Anthony Bogues (2012: 34) observes that "[[it is a critical
task of radical thought today to work with the speech of those who have
been historically excluded from the history of thought]{.underline}," [a
practice that requires "coming to grips with the speech and practices"
of those peoples who are marginalized within or excluded from the social
order as productive of thought. This involves taking seriously those
claims, actions, and practices that seemingly depart from or stand
outside of what is acceptable given prevailing social
norms.]{.underline}]{.mark} I want to extend Bogues's thinking,
particularly his explicit departure from Agamben's approach to the
exception through a foregrounding of the colonial, wherein [he focuses
on those who exist in a Fanonian zone of nonbeing.]{.underline} While I
am not suggesting that Ferguson and Baltimore are colonial contexts,
[the sovereign practices of those municipalities nonetheless operate
within the matrix of coloniality, where the black residents of Ferguson
and Baltimore are those on whom "practices of violence \[are\] conducted
that ma\[ke\] them not sites of exception but rather sites in which
regularized performances of violence as power \[are\]
enacted]{.underline}" (Bogues 2012: 34). In other words, I am after how
[the actions and speech of those in Baltimore and Ferguson reveal the
seeming exception as, in fact, the rule of rule.]{.underline} Within
days of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson's shooting and killing of
Brown, an eighteen-year-old unarmed black man who had recently graduated
high school, local residents and activists from around the country
descended on West Florissant Avenue in the St. Louis suburb. The
response of the local police department was to have officers in
military-grade riot gear and armored vehicles, using ash grenades and
tear gas, confront protesters. One week after Brown's body lay lifeless
in the street for four and a half hours, after police repeatedly
destroyed memorials that local residents had erected to Brown on the
spot where he was killed, Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared a state
of emergency in Ferguson. Although the state of emergency imposed a
curfew that made it illegal to be out after midnight, protests
continued, as did clashes with local and state police, even after Nixon
called in the National Guard. Yet, in what many saw as an unprece-
dented move, on November 17, 2014, Nixon declared another state of emer-
gency, this time in anticipation of the St. Louis County grand jury's
decision on whether to indict Wilson. Some might have considered Nixon's
second state of emergency prescient. Indeed, on November 25, when it was
announced that the grand jury had decided against handing down an
indict- ment of Wilson, Ferguson erupted. [After witnessing their son's
body lying in the blistering August heat, handling his transition,
burial, and an unimaginable level of grief, Brown's mother, Lezley
[McSpadden]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} stepfather, Louis [Head]{.mark}, had to
hear not only that there would be no indictment but, possibly more
troubling, that St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch had
purposefully undermined any possibility of an indictment. Their range of
emotions [came together in a moment of grief, anger, and rage]{.mark}
when McSpadden, in tears and atop a car, addressed a crowd gathered
outside the Ferguson courthouse. McSpadden made it clear that after
having endured the loss of her son, she felt that the grand jury's
decision demonstrated a complete lack of care. "[They ain't never gonna
care. I been here my whole life, I ain't never had to go through nothing
like this,"]{.mark} [she told the crowd]{.mark}. As McSpadden began to
break down in tears, cries of "fuck the police" were mixed in with a
young woman yelling, "[We love you, Ms. Lezley," a uniquely Southern
black form of address]{.mark} for an honored community member,
especially a mother (McDonald 2014). McSpadden's justifiable [anger and
indignation helps us bring into view the central paradox of turning to
the state as the agent offering repair for the actions of the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} When CNN reporter Sunny Hostin
asked McSpad- den why she addressed the crowd, she explained, "We heard
this and it was just like, like I had been shot. Like you shoot me now"
(quoted in Ford and Levs 2014[). McSpadden refused to consider police
officer Wilson,]{.underline} county prosecutor McCulloch, [and the grand
jury as separate from one another or apart from the state]{.underline}.
Police killings are not, in such a formulation, the action of individual
police officers who represent the state but do not constitute the state
as such. Rather, [they are considered parts of a whole.]{.underline}
When McSpadden says, "[**[Like you shoot me now," she brings McCulloch's
handling of the grand jury into the same frame as Wilson, where she
identifies both as the "you" who shot her son and her. The "you" here
works to capture the state as the party causing
injury]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [To confront such a scenario, one has to
ask how a private "citizen" might reconcile the incongruity of turning
to the state to carry out repair of an injury that the state
caused.]{.underline} It was in this vortex of emotion that [Head climbed
onto the car to comfort his wife and then screamed out, "[Burn this
bitch down]{.mark},"]{.underline} delivering it at a pitch that many
would all too easily explain away as an "excited utter- ance." Yet [Head
repeated his incendiary plea eleven times, which, while unintentional,
echoed Garner's plea, also uttered eleven times, "I can't
breathe."]{.underline} The resonance of Head's "excited utterance" with
Garner's pleas is that [it resists the disciplining impulse to render it
as thoughtless anger]{.underline}. Indeed, Head acted somewhat
deliberately. An Al Jazeera America camera recorded him saying moments
before he climbed onto the car, "If I get up there, [[I'm gonna start a
riot.]{.mark} Burn this bitch down]{.underline}" (quoted in America
Tonight Digital Team 2014). As Head would later describe his "outburst,"
"I screamed words that I shouldn't have screamed in the heat of the
moment" (quoted in Alcindor and Bacon 2014), an apparent apology born of
the necessities of our political present, where the legitimacy of one's
grief and anger, one's claim to injury, especially if one is black,
depends on one's expression of that grief on the terms sanctioned by the
social order. Central to such a demand is that people design their
expression of grief so as to cause minimal disruption to that order.
Head, McSpadden, and their advisers certainly understood this in having
Head issue an apology, particularly given the efforts to charge him with
inciting a riot. [The response from black political elites revealed the
continued sway of a civil rights approach that seeks to maintain a moral
ground by putting forth the unimpeachable citizen exemplar of sacrifice.
Such an approach requires a disavowal of Head's "outburst" as a mistake,
mere thoughtless anger.]{.underline} Rather than attempt to explain away
Head's anger, I want to suggest that [we can see [in his
shouting]{.mark} "burn this bitch down" an adequate response to his
slain son and to Eric Garner's pleas; his is an anger that, as if
speaking to Frantz Fanon's observation, "[we revolt simply
because,]{.mark} for many reasons, [we can no longer
breathe]{.mark}]{.underline}," [[expressed a desire for the total
destruction of the racial state. Doing so enables us to dwell on the
possibilities that his defiant call holds for thinking through a mode of
black politics that refuses the pre- vailing protocols and logics
governing public demands for reparative justice]{.mark}.]{.underline} My
interest is not to explain Head's or any other seemingly "extreme"
expres- sion of anger as a departure from black politics. [What we find
in such expressions, which include the [uprisings]{.mark} in Ferguson
and Baltimore, is a critique that [exceeds the sensibilities of
liberal]{.mark} black [political discourse precisely in their suggestion
of the incompatibility]{.mark}, or possibly the constitutive exclusion,
[of the black as noncitizen]{.mark}, the paradigmatic
other.]{.underline} By taking Head as engaged in political discourse, I
want to see in his apology more than an attempt to negotiate the
protocols of legitimate or acceptable speech. Given the social function
of apology---admission of a violation and an agreement or promise to
avoid any such future violation--- those apologizing recognize their
transgression of a social or political norm and locate guilt for that
violation in their own actions or words.2 This was certainly part of
what Head intended when he said, "I humbly apologize to all of those who
read my pain and anger as a true desire for what I want for our
community." Still, we might better view his statement as an apologia---a
defense or justi cation of his "outburst."3 Head went on: "[But to place
blame solely on me for the conditions of our community, and country,
after the grand jury decision, goes way too far and is as wrong as the
decision itself. To declare a state of emergency and send a message of
war, and not peace, before a grand jury decision was announced is also
wrong]{.underline}" (quoted in Alcin- dor and Bacon 2014). I want to
consider Head's apologia as centering on a critique of the racial state
through his identification of Governor Nixon's November 17, 2014, state
of emergency order as the context in which he expressed his pain and
anger. [The fundamental injury in this instance becomes the actions of
the state itself]{.underline}, though not simply because the grand jury
refused to indict Wilson, or even because county prosecutor McCulloch
worked to ensure that the grand jury would not return an indictment.
Whereas Agamben might consider Nixon's two state of emergency orders the
moment an exception appeared, [Head invites us to bring into view a
longer-running exception already in place. As such, [his]{.mark}
original "[outburst" brings to mind]{.mark} not so much [a desire to
destroy]{.mark} property or "our community" but [the institutional
orderings]{.mark} of the local municipality [in which black people
experienced a perpetual exception]{.mark}. Head's invective thus
reflects a knowledge born from experiencing Ferguson as a régime
d'exception]{.underline}. Unlike in Mbembe's (2001) framing, where the
departure from common law occurs when privileged individuals and
companies constitute for themselves a "form of sovereignty," in Ferguson
there was no departure as such, as the posture that the municipality of
Ferguson assumed toward its black residents was that of a sovereign
toward its subjects who existed outside the compact of consensual
governance. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) report on Ferguson offers
insight into how the city's revenue-generating strategy allowed local
police and courts to elaborate an exception. As the report outlines,
generating revenue through policing black residents "fostered practices
in the two central parts of Ferguson's law enforcement system---policing
and the courts---that are themselves unconstitutional or that contribute
to constitutional violations" (DOJ 2015: 27). Where for the police these
policies led to practices that "resulted in a pattern and practice of
constitutional violations" (27) of black residents' First and Fourth
Amendment rights, the local courts assumed as their primary goal
maximizing revenue rather than "administering justice or protecting the
rights of the accused" (68). The DOJ (2016: 24) investiga- tion of the
Baltimore police discovered a similar "pattern or practice of mak- ing
stops, searches, and arrests in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments" where they lacked "reasonable suspicion of people who
\[were\] lawfully present on Baltimore streets," which in turn
"escalate\[d\] street encounters and contribute\[d\] to o cers making
arrests without probable cause." The DOJ's (2015: 27) concern in both
instances lay with the erosion of "police legitimacy and community
trust" that made "policing in Ferguson less fair, less e ective at
promoting public safety, and less safe," a concern the DOJ (2016: 29)
repeated in its Baltimore report, where it identi ed the practice of
unlawful stops and searches as working to "erode public con - dence in
law enforcement and escalate street encounters." The DOJ reports on
Ferguson and Baltimore take as a core concern the erosion of black trust
in the police, where the level of distrust helps to esca- late
encounters between black people and the police. This is no minor prob-
lem. Amy E. Lerman and Vesla Weaver (2014) explain that this eroding
trust in the police and the state more generally gives rise to what they
call custo- dial citizenship, where citizenship is transformed from a
mode of civic engagement through democratic structures into a series of
maneuvers designed to minimize encounters with the state. This sense of
needing to evade encountering the state certainly seemed to have guided
Garner's, Gray's, and Brown's respective encounters with the police o
cers who killed them. The DOJ (2016) report on Baltimore is littered
with incidents where black people breaking no laws attempt to evade and
avoid encounters with the police. What the DOJ reports do not question,
and it would have been surprising if they had, is whether the erosion of
black people's trust in the agents of the state, and thus the state
itself, was of recent provenance. In light of Joel Olson's (2004: xv)
observation that "American democracy is a white democracy, a polity
ruled in the interests of a white citizenry and char- acterized by
simultaneous relations of equality and privilege . . . in relation to
those who are not white," we might question whether there is a basis for
black citizenship to be anything other than custodial, with a
corresponding fugitive orientation toward (or away from) state
apparatuses.4 To put the question di erently, is it useful to approach
the problem of the "erosion" of black trust in the state as one that the
state can solve? To answer this question demands that we give attention
to how the state approaches the issue of police violence. One feature of
both the DOJ's (2015: 48; 2016: 74) reports on Ferguson and Baltimore
that deserves atten- tion is their reliance on the US Supreme Court's
1989 Graham v. Connor decision that provides the legal framework for how
to assess police o cers' use of force. The key passage from that ruling
(Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989)), quoted in both reports,
holds that police o cers' use of force must be judged based on whether
"the o cers' actions are 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts
and circumstances confronting them," wherein the central element of such
an assessment is "the perspective of a reasonable o cer on the scene,"
rather than "the 20/20 vision of hindsight." The part of the ruling that
neither report references, however, holds that such an assessment is to
be made "without regard to \[the o cer's\] underly- ing intent or
motivation." The e ect of this ruling, which allows for the use of force
if the o cer determines that a "suspect poses an immediate threat to the
safety of the o cers or others," is that the o cer is the sole body
capable of determining whether force, and what degree of force, is
necessary---"even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a
judge's chambers" (Gra- ham, 490 U.S. at 396). Graham thus provides the
legal justi cation for police o cers to exercise violence, but outside
the judgment or oversight of any other governmental body; the police
become, in e ect, the sovereign, and they are the ones who decide. This
is not the suspension of law that Agam- ben describes as a moment that
democracies arrive at---thus marking their historiographical distinction
from totalitarian regimes. Rather, the context in which black people
exist is itself the exception. Notwithstanding the insights we might
gain from the DOJ's investiga- tions into the Ferguson and Baltimore
police departments, these reports fol- low a pattern whereby the state
is the agent o ering repair for actions of the state. In finding fault
with local police departments or municipal courts, the issue is rendered
a strictly local one. That the police practices described in Ferguson
and Baltimore are also found in Philadelphia, Cleveland, New Orleans,
and Milwaukee (all police departments under consent decrees) never seems
to present the possibility that what the DOJ has "uncovered" in any of
these departments is less an aberration from the norm than the norm
itself. Indeed, rarely have such ndings resulted in the prosecution of
local police o cers for corruption. Under Graham, police o cers are
virtually unprosecutable. [We are confronted, then, with the Ferguson
and Baltimore uprisings mounting what we might describe as an
ontological challenge to the guiding premise of black politics as a
liberal engagement that pursues redress so that black life can matter
within US liberal democracy.]{.underline} [Rather than the suspension of
law during an emergency, or an aberration from legitimate modes of
governance, what Ferguson and Baltimore bring into sharp relief is that
the police, even before the juridical armature of Graham, exercised the
sovereign right to kill]{.underline}. It is in this context that we
should read [Head's "outburst," his unacceptable, nonsensical speech, as
making a fundamental claim about the nature of Western democracies.
Head's words reveal how Ferguson is less a zone of exception, an
aberration arrived at, than an example of a constitutive element in the
operation of democracy. Head thus rejects a politics largely rejected in
dominant black political discourse, yet one that suggests something of
the nature of US democratic governance as constituted through an
exception.]{.underline}

which are invariably used against Black and Brown communities in the
US.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The Programme has allowed police departments
to acquire vehicles (land, air, and sea), weapons, computer equipment,
fingerprint equipment, night vision equipment, radios and televisions,
first aid equipment, tents and sleeping bags, photographic equipment and
more. **[There is no more [glaring proof that the US has been waging war
against both Black people within its borders and those in Africa]{.mark}
than a cursory examination of the responses by the US national security

essence unfolds when comparing what took place]{.underline}** from the
1950s to the 70s **[in the US Black Power, Civil Rights movements with
the independence, anti-colonial movement in Africa.]{.underline}**
Documented evidence vividly illustrates that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI)'s infamous Counterintelligence Programme, also known
as COINTELPRO, orchestrated operations to "infiltrate, intimidate,
imprison, and assassinate" the leaders of Black movements for social
justice in the US. In Africa, the US executed identical and
chronologically aligned repression through the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) against the independent African governments and liberation
movements sweeping the continent. **[[No matter where in the world

threat to the political, economic, and cultural interest of the US

the new African states were subjected to coup d'états and incessant
assassination attempts including that of Kwame Nkrumahin Ghana, the
successful assassination of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, and today we

continue tantamount treatment, like spying on Black Lives Matter
activists, monitoring their social media and creating the bogus FBI
designation Black Identity Extremists to malign them as responsible for
violence against police. All the while tolerating organised, criminal
infiltration of law enforcement by violent white supremacists.
**[AFRICOM is the US response]{.underline}** to economic competition

**[to prevent the emergence of any independent African influence or

as stated in their promotional materials. **[The US military presence is

2012 overthrow of a democratically elected government in Mali by an

AFRICOM, was rebuked across the African continent when attempting to
establish the headquarters for AFRICOM on the continent, forcing the new
command to work out of Europe. Then came the Obama administration that
paved the way for the proliferation of AFRICOM on the continent, as
quisling African leaders fell over themselves to cooperate with the
first Black US President. A now acceptable scenario has resulted in 46
various forms of US bases as well as military-to-military relations
between almost all of the 54 African countries and the United States. US
Special Forces troops now operate in more than a dozen African nations
reflecting a 1,900 percent increase in the US military presence in
Africa. [**[What impact has increased militarisation abroad had on US
Black and Brown communities? Since 1990, about US \$6 billion worth of

**[to local, state, federal and tribal law-enforcement agencies while
communities are suffering from austerity cuts. The world saw this
deployed against Black rebellions in response to the police shooting of
an unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
The first actual militarisation of the US police started 28 years before
the 1033 Programme in the 1960s with the creation of the Special Weapons
And Tactics units --commonly known as SWAT. In South Africa (Azania) the
same thing was developed at exactly the same time. The Special Task
Force (STF) was an elite police tactical unit of the white settler
regime's South African Police Service (SAPS). The first significant
deployments of SWAT and STF units were to repress African/Black
movements for liberation. On 9 December 1969 SWAT was deployed for a
four-hour confrontation with members of the Black Panthers in a densely
populated area of Los Angeles. In 1967 about 2,000 STF forces were
deployed to guard the northern border of Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe)
to assist Rhodesian security forces against the liberation forces there.
Roger Morris, former National Security staffer for Henry Kissinger,
admits that of the dozens of coup d'états that have taken place in

US destabilisation. **[The sale of small arms to "Black Africa" was a

It is my contention that African American linguist Geneva Smitherman is
working within the rich situated practices of Africana philosophy and
should be acknowledged as such. She is self-consciously aware of the
metareflective analysis that is necessary to make sense of what it means
for Black people to have forged an identity through the muck and mire of
white racism. After all, [[Black folk]{.mark} [were deemed **inherently
inferior**]{.mark}**, cultureless**, without Geist. [Yet, Black agency
survived]{.mark}]{.underline} the tortuous African blood-stained water
of the Atlantic. [Like Jazz]{.underline} (with its improvisatory
structure and chromatic form), [the Blues]{.underline} (with its
ontology of lyrically holding at a distance incredible pain and sorrow),
[and rap music]{.underline} (with its phat beats, lyrical braggadocio,
and in yo face street reality), [[African American Language is a
significant site of Black **cultural
innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [syncretism, [and
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**[[, laden with situated **epistemological
insights**]{.underline}.]{.mark} There is no other way to honor the work
of Geneva Smitherman, [to explore the "**language- gaming**" of everyday
Black folk]{.underline}, without directly and unapologetically entering
into the dynamic, rhythmic, ritual, and cognitive spaces of African
American linguistic expressiveness. [Hence, from the very giddayup, that
is, befo I bees gittin into some really dope cultural, historical,
philosophical, and **linguistic analyses**, [let's engage in a lil bit
of **naming and claiming**. Word! The power of
**Nommo**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Geneva Smitherman (a.k.a. [[Docta G)
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an educational activist, [[a **word
warrior**]{.mark}**, a language rights fighter**, a linguist-activist,
and a linguistic democratizer]{.underline}. Can I get a witness? Yeah,
that's right. [She is the legitimizer of African American Language
(**AAL**)]{.underline} (Smitherman 2001, 347). [The shonuff sista from
the hood who is **cognizant** of what it means to be a New World
African, to be linked to that shonuff Black space of talkin and
testifyin, stylin and profilin.]{.underline} [AAL is the **language of
her nurture**]{.underline} (343). She was, after all, baptized "in the
linguistic fire of Black Folk" (Smitherman 1997, 242). Believe me, [for
if I'm lyin, I'm flyin, she knows the source of those deleted
copulas]{.underline} ("The coffee cold"), those post-vocalic --r sounds
("My feet be tied," not "tired"), redundant past tense markings ("I
likeded her," not "liked"), few consonant pairs ("Those tesses was
hard," not "tests"), [stylizations, and rhetorical devices. [Docta G
operates within]{.mark} that unique African American space of
[performative "languaging," a **space of agency, contestation,
self-definition**]{.mark}, poiesis, [and hermeneutic
combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. She is all up in the cultural sphere of
ashy knees, nappy hair, and how we be actin so saddity. Ah, yes, and she
knows about the hot comb as a cultural artifact of self-hatred, a form
of hatred instilled through the power of colonial white aesthetics. [She
**member** where she come from. She got **no desire to front**. [Docta
G's medium is the message]{.mark}]{.underline}. She avoids what
linguist- philosopher John L. Austin refers to as the "descriptive
fallacy," which involves the assumption that the main function of
language is to describe things. Through the incorporation of AAL flava
in her written works (and no doubt in her lectures), Docta G is doing
something with those words and phrases. [[Her
writings]{.underline}]{.mark}, in short, [are demonstrative
[enactment]{.mark}s of the historical, stylistic, political,
communicative, cognitive, and [**social ontological power** of
A]{.mark}frican [A]{.mark}merican [L]{.mark}anguage. Docta G is the lion
who has learned]{.underline} how to write, [how to narrate a
**counterhistorical narrative**, and how to recognize and theorize a
counterlanguage. [A **metalinguist**, she is a cultural, ethical, and
political theorist]{.mark}.]{.underline} If push comes to shove, she'll
"choose goodness over grammar" (349). She knows that the politics of
language policy is a larger question of the politics of reality
construction, historical structuring of society, race, class, and
Anglo-linguistic imperialism. As such, she moves between both the
sociolinguists (who stress social and ethnic language) and the Cartesian
or Chomskyan linguists (who stress "ideally competent" language). She
knows that [the right to speak [AAL is a question of **linguistic
freedom, agency, and justice**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A womanist,
[[moving within that bold, **self-assertive**, and we-affirming
space]{.mark} of sistas like Angela Davis, Alice Walker, Patricia Hill
Collins, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman, [Docta G is responsible,
in charge, and serious. **She's no prisoner of the
academy**]{.mark}]{.underline}; rather, she is existentially and
politically committed to the Black community, its survival, and the
continual actualization of its cultural generative force. Smitherman
maintains that a womanist denotes an "African-American woman who is
rooted in the Black community and committed to the development of
herself and the entire community" (Smitherman 1996, 104). African
American women, empowered by their womanist consciousness, were
well-aware that white feminists had failed to critique,
self-reflexively, the normativity of their own whiteness.
Epistemologically, Black womanists occupied their own subject positions,
positions that did not square with the theorizations of white
middleclass women. [[You dig]{.underline}]{.mark} (Wolof: dega) [[what
I'm sayin? **Can I get an Amen?**]{.underline}]{.mark} Docta G,
"daughter of the hood," raised in Brownsville, Tennessee, was culturally
immersed in the rich locutionary acts of Black folk (Smitherman 2000,
xiii). [Y'all wit me?]{.underline} I'm pointing to the significant links
between Docta G's biographical location and how this influenced her
later theorizations about AAL. Consistent with feminist, womanist,
social constructionist, and postmodernist insights, one's social
location is a significant hermeneutic lens through which to understand
one's theorizations. [By emphasizing one's social location, one is able
to avoid the obfuscating process of
**reification**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} As social constructionists Peter
L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann maintain, "Reification is the apprehension
of human phenomena as if they were things, that is, in non-human or
possibly suprahuman terms" (Berger and Luckmann 1995, 36). In short, the
lived-context, as existential phenomenology stresses, is always already
presupposed in relationship to epistemological claims. Docta G, daughter
of the Black ghetto, daughter of Reverend Napoleon, was an early witness
to the illocutionary and perlocutionary acts of a linguistically rich
Black family, a sharecropping community, and a Traditional Black Church.
For example, [she knows the power of tonal semantics, a significant
feature of AAL that moves the listener through melodic structure and
poignant **rhetorical configuration**.]{.underline} She relates that her
father once expressed the following theme in one of his sermons: "I am
nobody talking to Somebody Who can help anybody" (Smitherman 2001, 222).
[Geneva]{.underline}, monolingual and from the sociolinguistic margins,
[was well-aware of what it meant to be deemed a problem, to endure the
pain of being told that her speech was "**pathological**," "**wrong**,"
"**inferior**," "bad," and "derelict."]{.underline} Having gone North
(or was it simply up South?) where she attended college, Geneva had to
pass a test "in order to qualify for the teacher preparation program"
(1). Given the then oppressive and racist language policy, a policy that
stressed the importance of teachers being able to speak the language of
those who "carry on the affairs of the English-speaking people" (2),
[Geneva did not pass **the speech test**.]{.underline} Docta G explains:
We found ourselves in a classroom with a speech therapist who wasn't
sure what to do with us. Nobody was dyslexic. No one was aphasic. There
was not even a stutterer among us. I mean here was this young white
girl, a teaching assistant at the university, who was just trying to get
her Ph.D., and she was presented with this perplexing problem of people
who didn't have any of the communication disorders she had been trained
to deal with. (2) Although Geneva eventually passed the test by simply
memorizing the pronunciation of particular sounds she needed to focus
on, she came to interpret this experience as key to stimulating her
politico-linguistic consciousness. She relates that "it aroused the
fighting spirit in me, sent me off into critical linguistics and I
eventually entered the lists of the language wars" (3). Clearly, this
experience created in Geneva a powerful sense of agency and praxis. On
the strength! You know it. As Kenyan philosopher and literary figure
Ngu\~gi\~ wa Thiong'o argues, "There is no history which is purely and
for all time that of actors and those always acted upon" (Thiong'o 1993,
131). [Uhm [talkin bout]{.mark} a Womanist, [Docta G. You know, the
chief]{.mark} expert [witness for]{.mark} the **[linguistic
intelligence]{.mark}** of Black children, the one who has made it her
**political project [to challenge]{.mark}** effectively [the totalizing
systems of Euro]{.mark}/Anglo-[linguistic **cultural
normativity**.]{.mark}]{.underline} You betta act like you know. [[She
fightin against African American **linguistic erasure**. Naw]{.mark},
even more so, [she fightin for African American

[It is here that one might ask: "Are Anglo-American and European
**philosophical forms of discourse inadequate** for re-presenting the
complexity of Black experiences?"]{.underline} After all, not any form
of discursivity will do. [[My experiences were in **excess of**]{.mark}
what ["Standard"]{.mark} American [English]{.mark} could capture.
[Some]{.mark} [forms of knowledge become **substantially truncated and
distorted**]{.mark}, indeed, erased, [if not expressed through the
familiar linguistic media of those who have possession of such
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a passage rich with issues concerning
the lack of power and effectiveness of "Standard" American English to
capture the personal identity and personal experiences of a young Black
boy, writer R. DeCoy asks: [[How ... my Nigger Son, can you ever hope to
**express** what you are, who you are]{.mark} or your experiences with
God, [in a language **so limited**,]{.mark} conceived by a people who
are **quite helpless** in explaining themselves? [How can you, my Nigger
Son, find your **identity**, articulate your experiences, in an order of
**words**?]{.mark}]{.underline} (quoted in Brown 2001, 59--60) Regarding
white philosophers (or even Black ones) who simply fail to understand
the importance of African American Language as a rich cultural and
philosophical site of expression, I believe that [it is the job of
knowledgeable and responsible Black philosophers]{.underline}---at least
for those who are willing to admit that they speak both the Language of
Wider Communication (or LWC) and the powerful vernacular shaped by
African retentions and African American linguistic nuances---[to invite
them to enter African American semiotic spaces of discursive difference
and overlap.]{.underline} We should keep in mind that being Black or
African American in North America does not ipso facto mean that one is
familiar with the subtle complexities and power of African American
Language. After all, there are Black philosophers from middle-class (and
lower-class) backgrounds whose linguistic assimilation of "Standard"
American English, a form of cultural capital ownership and privilege,
functions both as a badge of white acceptance and as an antidote for
reducing white anxiety and fear. [The invitation, though, should not be
a plea, but an **honest gesture** to explore the language on its own
terms. This is why it was so very important that this present article be
written unapologetically in the language of my nurture: [the]{.mark}
**[medium had to be the message]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Keep in mind
that an invitation is not the same as a forced introduction. This was
the situation that [[Blacks]{.underline}]{.mark} of African descent
faced; they [[were forced to learn the **language of the
colonizer**]{.mark}, forced to split, [to multiply in]{.mark} so [many
different cultural, psychological, linguistic, and spiritual directions
**against their will**.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}The fact that this
article appears in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy invites a
certain level of cultural and linguistic splitting on the part of its
readers, perhaps not very different from what is required when reading
Kant or Heidegger, particularly given their penchant for neologism.
Let's be honest, articles that typically appear in the Journal of
Speculative Philosophy have no doubt been written in "Standard" American
English and by predominantly white male philosophers, philosophers who
have been trained to engage in "proper" philosophical prose. I, too, can
write in this language. [To write in this language is to **reproduce the
professional culture** of philosophy, to perpetuate lines of power, and
to show that you have been "properly" educated and worthy of
hire.]{.underline} Moreover, to engage in this discourse is to perform
linguistically before an audience of gatekeepers who probably fear too
much fat in their discourse, too much play, too much signifying, too
much indirection, too much ambiguity, too much vagueness, too much
concrete, everyday reality. Like African American Language within the
larger context of "Standard" American Language, [[by appearing in this
journal this article]{.mark} also [enters into a space of established
norms of linguistic propriety, **calling into question** and]{.mark}
perhaps [**rupturing** the authority of "Standard" philosophical prose,
that **unhip discourse of professional**
philosophers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, having this article
published in this journal could turn out to be a curse or a blessing.
Realizing the degree to which "proper" philosophical discourse is
required by philosophy journals, and how such discourse in turn shapes
and legitimates philosophy journals, many readers of the journal may
read the article with contempt. Some may approach the article as a piece
of exotica. Some may even view my use of African American Language as a
disgraceful "Stepin Fetchit" performance that does a disservice to Black
philosophers who are all too eager to perform well in the presence of
white power, to show the world that we be real philosophers because we
speak the language of Mister Charlie. Then, of course, there are some
philosophers who are open to creative possibilities, differences, and
alternatives to hegemonic linguistic territorialism, who believe in
plural experiences and multiple discourses for articulating them. It's
here, of course, that [I got to give props to my man JJS for being hip
to the importance of **multiple philosophical voices** and the different
and **complex** existential spaces within which they emerge. When the
medium is the message, [one has got to **get wit da
medium.**]{.mark}]{.underline} It will take more than this article to
create a significant impact on a certain linguistic-philosophical
reference point that is buttressed by so much history and power, but the
Journal of Speculative Philosophy is a good place to begin, right in the
midst of professional philosophy-speak. [[To best articulate that Black
existential space where the]{.mark} real [world]{.mark} (not that

#### Link: The alt does not challenge materially challenge institutions -- Occupy proves state action is needed to avoid individualism 

**Cutler** 11/15/**16** (Sophia, writer and dancer residing in Montreal,
Occupying Trump,
<https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/donald-trump-occupy-wall-street-zuccotti-park/>)

[Others]{.underline} correctly [noted]{.underline} that [Occupy wasn't a
traditional political movement that made demands upon the state. It
instead turned inward, believing the]{.underline} consensual and
nonhierarchical [community it was building in Zuccotti **constituted a
demand in itself**.]{.underline} [Sympathizers touted the camp as the
instantiation of a new social awareness,]{.underline} a new way of
relating to one another. "\[W\]e are literally laying the framework for
a new world by building it here and now --- and it works," the New York
City encampment proclaimed. [This consensual social experience
**centered on the autonomy of the individual**]{.underline}. [Occupiers
were not held accountable to any particular agenda or
leadership]{.underline}. As one participant put it at a general assembly
meeting, "None of us are leaders; \[therefore\] we are all leaders."
Today, [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} high school [students walk out en masse
and [anti-Trump protests sweep]{.mark} the country]{.underline}, [**[the
memory of Occupy should give us pause.]{.mark}** [Instead of]{.mark}
creating [a political movement that **materially attacked**]{.mark} the
**[institutions]{.mark}** of the 1 percent, many [occupiers vowed to
transform themselves and raise awareness **at the individual
level**]{.mark}. Some responses to Trumpism **have fallen into the same
trap** --- treating the election of a far-right demagogue
as]{.underline} an opportunity for soul-searching or [a reason to **rail
against individual Trump voters**]{.underline}. [But just as tending
urban gardens didn't fundamentally challenge the prerogatives of
capital, **safety pins won't bring down the reactionary figures taking
the reins of government**. To stop Trump, **we'll have to reject** some
of Occupy's **central precepts**.]{.underline} Occupy Individualism
[Occupy's emphasis on the individual sprang from its horizontalist
antecedents]{.underline} --- particularly the May 1968 occupations in
France. Kalle Lasn and Micah White, who launched Occupy with their
famous Adbusters meme, explicitly cited the leaderless,
anti-hierarchical student demonstrations in Paris as their inspiration.
Yet it's telling that the sixties critique of uniformity and authority
was appropriated not only by subsequent social movements, but by
capitalism. Calls "to live, to express oneself, to be free" now survive
as tag lines for soft-drinks and SUVS. In their book The New Spirit of
Capitalism, Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello go so far as to argue that
capitalism co-opted the '68 demands for autonomy to create our
contemporary postindustrial economy of worker instability and commanded
flexibility. The ease with which the sixties ethos of autonomy was
co-opted by capital didn't seem to trouble Lasn and White, however. They
saw the rise of autonomous politics as a source of potential rather than
a sign of a weakened and splintered left. In their famous July 2011 call
to occupy, Lasn and White celebrated a worldwide shift in revolutionary
tactics. They quoted Raimundo Viejo, an activist with the 15-M movement
in Spain: "\[B\]ack then our model was to attack the system like a pack
of wolves. There was an alpha male, a wolf who led the pack, and those
who followed behind. Now the model has evolved. Today we are one big
swarm of people." Following this leaderless model, Lasn and White took
no ownership of the movement. In fact, neither even visited Zuccotti
Park that fall. Instead, they shared their idea with a listserv of
ninety thousand "redeemers, rebels, and radicals" and allowed it to
evolve on its own. While they suggested ending Citizens United as one
unifying demand, they left it to the occupiers themselves to formulate
"one demand in a plurality of voices." But the one-plank platform never
materialized. As the protest expanded to include thousands of occupiers
in hundreds of cities, the mainstream media increasingly pressed Occupy
to lay out a set of policy desires. The fast-approaching winter months
exacerbated these pressures, as camps across the country scrambled to
figure out how to sustain an outdoor occupation in the cold. [Occupy's
system of consensus-based decision-making turned this into a tiring and
time-consuming]{.underline}, if not effectively [impossible,
task]{.underline}. Inspired by Spain's acampadas, the occupiers opened
general assemblies to everyone. If someone vehemently disagreed with a
proposal, they could block it, and it would have to be adapted until a
super-majority of ninety percent supported the proposal. It did not
matter if the dissenter was new to a movement others had been invested
in for weeks; they had just as much of a say as the original Occupiers.
**[As a result, a simple decision like how to take care of laundry could
take hours to make.]{.underline}** The Occupy's New York City General
Assembly explained why the process was so important to the movement: The
care we take in a consensus process to hear everyone's opinions and
weave them into a whole is a living demonstration that each one of us is
important. It's a counter to systems that tell us some people count
while others don't. In consensus, everyone matters. Consensus-based
decision-making, then, was understood as a way to include marginalized
voices in a movement that claimed to represent the 99 percent. But
[[Occupy fostered inclusivity through **individualism rather than
organized collective action**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In countless
interviews about the movement, participants cautioned, "I can only speak
for myself." The ubiquitous caveat frustrated attempts to understand
Occupy as a whole and to advance a collective project]{.underline}.
Discussion became confined to personal experiences and opinions. Instead
of a rallying point of unison, "We are the 99%" became a Twitter hashtag
for the individual to express his personal struggles. [[In casting
individual experiences as **fundamentally unknowable**]{.mark} to
others, occupiers ignored the feminist insistence that the "personal is
political."]{.underline} The second-wave slogan emerged as a reaction to
the capitalist credo of personal responsibility, pointing to the ways in
which individual experiences were not merely private but in fact defined
and shaped by political and social institutions. Distinct, yes --- but
still fundamentally collective. As [Occupy gradually took shape, it
moved in the opposite direction, **loading the burden on the
individual.**]{.underline} Too often[, **[the political was nothing but
the personal]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Too frequently, [[occupiers focused
on "kill\[ing\] the one-percenter within" **instead of pressuring the
state to rein in the 1 percent.**]{.underline}]{.mark} All of this was
fine with Adbusters. As [White's latest book makes clear, the
anti-consumerist, culture-jamming magazine still regards resistance as a
matter of changing one's thought patterns and lifestyle
choices.]{.underline} In The End of Protest --- a self-styled "new
playbook for revolution" --- the Adbusters editor touts a "subjectivist"
theory of protest, arguing that by transforming one's inner reality, one
can transform one's external material reality. "[In our global struggle
to liberate humanity," he writes, "the most significant battles will be
fought on the spiritual level --- inside our heads, within our
imagination and deep in our collective unconscious]{.underline}."
[**While it's easy to laugh at his claim [that "climate change is
happening because of the state of our minds]{.mark}**,"]{.underline}
[[this]{.mark} sort of [magical thinking **survives in the recent
outpouring** of praise for ]{.mark}]{.underline}Occupy as
[[consciousness-raising]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It]{.mark} also [lives
on]{.mark} in [the call to check one's privilege]{.mark}, [which]{.mark}
often [imagines]{.mark} that **[self-edification]{.mark} --- [rather
than structural change]{.mark} --- [can solve
inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But [[realizing one's]{.mark}
individual [privilege does nothing to **dismantle the prison industrial
complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or [**[block environmentally destructive
legislation]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} **[improve wages for
workers]{.underline}**.]{.mark} As Barbara J. Fields remarks:
**[Ideology is not a set of attitudes that people can "have" as they
have a cold,]{.underline}** and throw off the same way. [Human beings
live in human societies by negotiating a certain social terrain, whose
map they keep alive in their minds by the collective, ritual repetition
of the activities they must carry out in order to negotiate the terrain.
**If the terrain changes, so must their activities, and therefore so
must the map.**]{.underline} Fields' definition of ideology puts the
power of personal autonomy in its place. [Rather than a "law unto
itself," the individual is situated in the prevailing system of
authority]{.underline}. **[Before the individual can be changed, the
system must be restructured.]{.underline}** [Lessons From
Occupy]{.underline} Both Fields' conception of ideology and [the
[shortcomings of Occupy are worth keeping in mind as we mobilize]{.mark}
against Trump and his racism, sexism, and Islamophobia. **An effective
opposition movement cannot be about privilege checking or soul
searching**. It must challenge the structures and forces that brought
Trump to power.]{.underline} Campus safe spaces won't do this. Neither
will safety pins. [Instead we must **stand against the disastrous
effects of deregulation, privatization, and a disintegrating social
safety net.**]{.underline} **[[We must organize collectively against an
economic system that uses racism, xenophobia, and misogyny to pit worker
against worker.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Taking on an entire economic and
political system sounds daunting.]{.underline} [Especially in the face
of a **rising far right**, **smaller victories**]{.underline} --- [like
moral denunciations and attitudinal shifts]{.underline} --- **[may seem
like our only option.]{.underline}**

#### The first impact is democracy- empirics show the attitude of the affirmative drives down participation, decreasing the position of the people in our decisionmaking

**Gustavsson 07**
<http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:54566/FULLTEXT01.pdf>

Individualism is often thought to constitute the cultural core of the
American dream. Indeed, individualism has been called "the dominant
ideology of American life".24 Ever since Alexis de Tocqueville, this
mythical individualism has invoked both fear and awe. The fear has been
grounded in concerns over the potentially [[eroding effects that
individualism might have on America]{.mark}n society]{.underline};
concerns that are now becoming perhaps more articulate than ever. There
is now extensive evidence [that [political engagement in the
Un]{.mark}ited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}[,]{.mark} or at least
traditional forms of it, [[is rapidly declining]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This change seems to have taken place sometime between the 1970's and
the late 1990's. During this time, there seems to have been a
[[considerable decrease in]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[voter
turnout]{.mark}, petition signing, [attendance of town meetings]{.mark}
and political rallies, [serving on committees]{.mark}, making political
speeches, writing political articles and [participating in groups
concerned with governmental reform]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 Meanwhile,
however, other radical changes have taken place. [The number of protest
and civil rights movements has steadily grown higher than
ever]{.underline}. And during roughly the same two or three decades, the
American population has also become much more tolerant and supportive of
diversity. Compared to the 1970's, the American population of the late
1990's showed a much greater support for gender equality, civil
liberties and racial integration.26

#### Impact two is soft despotism

**Foundation for Constitutional Government no date**
<http://thegreatthinkers.org/tocqueville/introduction/>

Tocqueville fears that democratic [[individualism would
produce]{.underline}]{.mark} what he called, in his first volume,
"[tyranny of the majority]{.underline}," [and,]{.underline} in the
second, "[[soft despotism]{.underline}]{.mark}." As the English liberal
John Stuart Mill understood, this does not refer to a majority imposing
its will on a minority, but, rather, [to [the propensity of democratic
peoples to develop highly abstract]{.mark}]{.underline} political
[[ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} and erect bureaucratic structures [[that
rob them of the need to act]{.underline}]{.mark} or think for themselves
except on the most trivial matters. Democracy could thus [[pose a danger
to both intellectual and political freedom]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Tocqueville notes that this new despotism is perhaps [[more insidious
than the traditional despotism, because it threatens to enslave the
souls of men]{.mark} [rather than simply their
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Trump loses in 2020: wall consolidates opposition of key ambivalent voters

**Brownstein 1/11**

Strategic Partnerships, in charge of long-term editorial strategy, *The

<https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/trumps-border-wall-could-cost-him-2020-votes/579952/>)\]

**[[Trump's Wall Could Cost Him in 2020]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
[[president's]{.underline}]{.mark} relentless [[effort to
cement]{.underline}]{.mark} the loyalty of [his [base
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[alienating]{.mark} him from]{.underline} the
[[ambivalent voters who provided]{.underline}]{.mark} him [[critical
support in 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}. President Donald Trump may now be
talking more about steel than cement, but his proposed border wall
remains the Rosetta Stone for understanding both his conception of the
presidency and his political strategy. Nothing better illustrates
Trump's political calculus than his determination to build the
[wall]{.underline}, a goal that [[most Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}
[consistently [oppose]{.mark}]{.underline} in polls, even [at the cost
of [shutting down the]{.mark}]{.underline} federal [[government]{.mark},
a tactic]{.underline} that surveys show [most Americans also
consistently reject]{.underline}. Politically, the [showdown over the
[shutdown]{.mark} [demonstrates]{.mark}]{.underline} how much more
[[Trump prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark} energizing and mobilizing his
passionate [[base]{.underline}]{.mark}, often [with]{.underline}
messages that appeal to [anxiety]{.underline} about demographic and
cultural change, [over broadening his support toward]{.underline}
anything that [approaches a majority of the country]{.underline}. It
sends the same message about his priorities in executing his office.
**[Trump makes no pretense of governing as president of the entire
nation]{.underline}**. Instead, he governs as the champion of his slice
of America against all the forces in the country his supporters dislike
or distrust---an instinct he displayed again this week with his latest
threats to cut off disaster-relief funding for California. For a
president to consistently steer his governing agenda and political
messaging toward a demonstrable minority of the country is, to put it
mildly, a novel strategy. But Trump may feel comfortable playing on the
short side of the field because it's worked for him before. In the 2016
election, a majority of voters said they had an unfavorable view of him
personally and did not believe he had the experience or temperament to
succeed as president, according to the Election Day exit poll conducted
by Edison Research. And yet [Trump]{.underline}, of course, [won a slim
Electoral College majority despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3
million]{.underline}. A **[[critical question]{.mark} looming [over 2020
is whether he could squeeze]{.mark} out another [victory while
facing]{.mark} [opposition from]{.mark} a
[majority]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the country. The struggle over the
border wall actually provides a revealing gauge of Trump's prospects on
that front. From the start of his presidential campaign,
[immigration]{.underline}, more than any other issue,
[captured]{.underline} the [potential benefits of Trump's strategy of
pursuing depth of support over breadth]{.underline}. Even during the
2016 Republican primaries, a majority of voters opposed deporting all
undocumented immigrants in all but two of the 20 states where exit polls
asked their opinion. Yet the minority of voters that supported
deportation backed Trump in such preponderant numbers that they provided
a majority of his votes in all but two of the 20 states. The same
pattern was evident in the general election. In the exit poll, just 41
percent of voters supported Trump's border wall, while a solid majority
of 54 percent opposed it. Yet Trump won a much higher share of the
wall's supporters (85 percent) than Hillary Clinton did of the wall's
opponents (76 percent). Roughly one-fourth of the wall's opponents
either voted for Trump (16 percent) or drifted away to a third-party
candidate (8 percent). That disparity reflected a clear trend in the
exit poll. On questions about Trump's personal characteristics---such as
whether he had the experience or temperament to succeed as
president---he consistently won a higher percentage of those who said
"yes" than Clinton won among those who said "no." That pattern may have
reflected doubts about Clinton, a willingness to roll the dice on a
political outsider, or a desire for change. But whatever the cause, the
pattern was decisive: [The pivotal votes that made Trump president came
from voters ambivalent at best about him and key elements of his
agenda]{.underline}. [After two years of arguing for the
wall]{.underline} as president, [Trump has shown no ability to expand
its popularity.]{.underline} In 10 national polls conducted during his
presidency, Quinnipiac University has never found support for the wall
higher than 43 percent. With his Oval Office address on Tuesday night,
Trump may have further consolidated support among Republicans and
conservatives, which could raise that number slightly. But his focus on
grisly portrayals of undocumented immigrants is unlikely to dent the
preponderant opposition to the wall among all the groups that powered
the Democratic takeover of the House last fall: minorities, young
people, and college-educated white voters. Depending on the survey, the
[wall usually faces opposition from at least two-thirds of minorities
and young people,]{.underline} and [between three-fifths and two-thirds
of college-educated whites]{.underline}. Looking back at 2016, Trump may
conclude that lopsided opposition from those groups doesn't matter so
long as he maintains strong support for the wall from his base. But
there's evidence that [the [voters]{.mark} [hostile to the wall]{.mark},
and to many other aspects of Trump's tenure, [are less willing to
give]{.mark} him the [benefit]{.mark} of the doubt [now than]{.mark}
they were [in 2016]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To test that
proposition, I compared results from the 2016 exit poll with findings
from Quinnipiac's latest national survey on the wall in December. That
comparison shows that **[[Trump]{.mark}'s position [among wall
opponents]{.mark} has [eroded dramatically]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Overall attitudes about the wall in the December poll remained similar
to 2016, with 43 percent supporting and 54 percent opposing. (Other
surveys, including Quinnipiac's, have usually found support slightly
lower, at about 40 percent.) Among whites both with and without a
four-year college degree, opinions on the wall in the Quinnipiac survey
showed only minimal change from the exit poll, with nearly three-fifths
of whites with a degree opposing the wall and nearly three-fifths of
those without a degree supporting it. But while overall attitudes about
the wall haven't changed much, attitudes toward Trump have deteriorated
significantly among the wall's critics. Opposition to the wall, just
like doubts about Trump's personal characteristics, was not a deal
breaker for a significant share of voters in the presidential election.
In the exit poll, 18 percent of the college-educated whites who opposed
the wall voted for Trump anyway, according to figures provided by Edison
Research. But [now, far fewer express support for Trump in
general]{.underline}. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, [just 3 percent of
these voters approved of Trump's job performance]{.underline}, according
to data provided by Quinnipiac. [Ninety-two]{.underline} percent
[disapproved]{.underline}. Likewise, just over one-fourth of
non-college-educated whites who opposed the wall still voted for Trump
in 2016. But in the latest Quinnipiac survey, only 9 percent of these
whites approved of Trump's performance, while 83 percent disapproved. In
all, fully 88 percent of Americans who oppose the wall say they
disapprove of Trump's performance as president. **[[Approval ratings
correlate closely with]{.mark} the [reelection vote for
incumbent]{.mark} presidents]{.underline}**. So that huge disapproval
number suggests that the 2020 Democratic nominee could win a
considerably higher share of wall opponents than the 76 percent who
voted for Clinton in 2016. By contrast, the share of wall supporters who
approve of Trump in Quinnipiac's latest poll is about the same (83
percent) as his vote among that group in 2016 (85 percent). That means
**[[opponents of]{.mark} the [wall are]{.mark} now [consolidating
against Trump's]{.mark} overall [performance at]{.mark} an even [higher
rate than]{.mark} its [supporters are coalescing]{.mark} behind
him]{.underline}**. [That's]{.underline} a [very different]{.underline}
landscape [than in 2016]{.underline}, and one that springs directly from
two years of governing in a volatile, confrontational manner aimed
almost entirely at his base, the strategy that he's escalated again by
shuttering the government over the wall. It's possible, of course, that
with slim victories in key Rust Belt and Sun Belt states, Trump can
squeeze out another Electoral College victory even if he loses the
popular vote again. His chances will rise if a third-party alternative
again divides the voters who are resistant to him. But these [patterns
of public reaction suggest that Trump's relentless effort to cement the
loyalty and stoke the outrage of his strongest supporters, compounded by
his volatile behavior in office, is building a wall between him and the
ambivalent voters who provided him critical support in 2016]{.underline}
(or at least withheld it from Clinton by splintering to third-party
candidates). The [sharp movement toward Democrats]{.underline} in the
midterm elections among independents and college-educated white voters,
both groups that broke closely for Trump in 2016, [points toward the
same conclusion]{.underline}. [Trump's monomania on the border wall
shows that he remains fixated on the priorities and resentments of his
core coalition]{.underline}. But **[[even a 30-foot barrier]{.mark}
probably [wouldn't protect him in 2020]{.mark} if he allows the waves of
discontent to continue rising among the majority of Americans who don't
consider themselves part of that ardent club]{.underline}**.

#### The plan's a populist win that Trump takes credit for and gives him the election in 2020.

**[[What if President Trump did popular stuff on
policy]{.mark}?]{.underline}** In particular, [[what]{.mark} [if
Democrats]{.mark} do well in the midterms]{.underline} and take the
House [and [start passing bills]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [then [Trump takes **their most popular
ideas**]{.mark} and **agrees with them?**]{.underline} Or at least with
watered-down versions of them? So [[maybe Trump
signs]{.underline}]{.mark} a bill to hike the minimum wage to \$12 an
hour, a deficit-financed surge in infrastructure spending, **[[some
version of a DREAM Act]{.underline}]{.mark}** paired to wall funding,
and maybe even something like the Manchin-Toomey background check bill.
[Up until now, [Trump has governed like a]{.mark} very [hardline]{.mark}
[conservative]{.mark}]{.underline} except on trade. But except for
**[[authoritarian views on immigration]{.underline}]{.mark}** and crime,
Trump doesn't have any personal history of consistency as a
conservative. And even during his 2016 campaign, he put forth a much
more eclectic, heterodox version of himself than how he's governed. Of
course, maybe that won't change no matter what happens in 2018. Maybe
he's a true prisoner of the conservative movement. Maybe he's always
harbored Heritage Foundation sympathies and they are just now blooming.
But [I think a reasonable person should have some humility about his
ability to foresee the future and admit that this [**bipartisan,
populist Trump** is]{.mark} at least **[a
possibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Trump's path to victory One
immediate consequence of this would be that it would give guys like Ben
Sasse and Mike Lee, who sometimes like to position themselves as more
high-minded than Trump, the opportunity to actually vote against the
president sometimes. Any Trump-Pelosi deal could easily weather a dozen
or so defections from the right that would allow that crew to own the
brand of "true conservatives" without needing to do anything to check
Trump's corruption or authoritarianism. Conversely, it would greatly
empower the left of the Democratic Party because it would cost more
moderate factions their resistance branding. [[Trump's electoral base
wouldn't mind]{.mark} a handful of ideological [betrayals since]{.mark}
rank-and-file [Republicans are]{.mark} really [here for]{.mark} the
[culture war stuff and not for]{.mark} the [concrete policy]{.mark}
anyway]{.underline}. [So [Trump would **enter**]{.mark} the
**[2020]{.mark}** campaign **[with his base
intact]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[but]{.mark} also [with the brand as a
freethinking moderate]{.mark} who's at odds with the right wing of
congressional Republicans]{.underline}. Democrats would end up
nominating someone with a relatively extreme rejectionist profile, and
[Trump would be in [a good position to]{.mark} **improve his approval
ratings** and **[get reelected]{.mark}**. Think of it as basically [a
rerun of]{.mark} [Bill Clinton in]{.mark}]{.underline} 1995-[['96 with
"**triangulation**]{.underline}]{.mark}." Now, of course, there are
other historical models. Richard Nixon signed a lot of moderately
progressive legislation to try to salvage his presidency, and it didn't
work. And the fairly productive Bush-Pelosi 110th Congress didn't
restore the GOP's popularity. Anyway, who knows? But I think the odds of
a Trump rebound are underrated.

#### A Trump re-election would be four more years of ableist hell.

**Harnish 17** (Andrew Harnish, Disability & Society, 2/15/17, "Ableism
and the Trump phenomenon," p. 424-425,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09687599.2017.1288684?needAccess=true)//jy

But reprehensible as it is, Trump's ableist rhetoric plainly has
purchase. One reason is simple: **[[many in the white working class --
and the working class writ large -- are deeply fearful of
disability]{.underline}.]{.mark}** Until recently, life for rural,
white, able-bodied Americans was broadly gratifying. [The automation of
agriculture, the outsourcing of manufacturing, and the neoliberal
assault on social services have left many rural Americans unable to find
jobs]{.underline} in their communities and debilitated by the great
distances they must travel to find employment. Life in rural America is
increasingly precarious, yet [rural American culture does not have a
strong tradition of valuing bodily difference or conceiving of people as
having worth beyond their labor value]{.underline}. While the urban
working class has access to a range of (often inadequate) government
services, the rural working class often lacks even this limited access.
[Low population density, limited access to public transportation, and
few social service offices make rural communities difficult to navigate
for those with disabilities.]{.underline} Yet, at least electorally,
[rural communities have not]{.underline} generally
[embraced]{.underline} the services that might make the [neoliberal
disruptions of the last quarter century more endurable]{.underline}.
Part of this is [because the culture of rural America
remains]{.underline} independent, rooted in family and [contemptuous of
the costs and diversity of the metropolis, scornful of]{.underline}
social investments, the '[welfare]{.underline}' that always seems to
benefit 'someone else' (Williams 2016). [Part, too, is due to a powerful
conservative media apparatus that is quick to denounce urban
entitlements, but seldom, if ever, highlights the government subsidies
that benefit its largely rural, white audience.]{.underline} In the face
of its own increasing economic and even bodily difference, much of rural
America has redoubled its isolation. **[[This is the environment Trump
preyed upon with his ableist rhetoric. Rural electoral complicity with
the neoliberal assaults on the welfare state has created an environment
where disabled working-class voters have few resources to fall back
on]{.underline}.]{.mark}** It is no wonder that many rural,
working-class whites are frightened of disability. The federal
government still offers people with disabilities limited financial
assistance, \$1070 dollars per month for 'non-blind persons' and \$1800
dollars monthly for 'blind persons' ('Facts and Figures' 2014), but
these sums are so low that many Americans cannot imagine living on them,
especially as, in much of the United States, [poverty is treated as a
moral flaw. So far, the left has not done a good job persuading rural
America that more accessible and inclusive communities will increase its
flourishing. Hillary Clinton tried]{.underline} to make this case -- she
spoke directly to people with disabilities. [But]{.underline} Donald
[**[Trump]{.mark}** eschewed this vision, **[denouncing racial and
disabled minorities, and promising to create rural, white working-class
jobs, and trounced Clinton in rural communities.]{.mark}** Employment
seems to promise the 'independence' prized in rural, working-class
culture]{.underline}. Conveniently for conservatives, these promises are
also a substitute for economically costly investments in the built
environment of rural communities: in public transportation, social
services, and child care, investments that would make those communities
more livable for people with disabilities and those with limited
economic means. The rural, white working class embraced Donald
[**[Trump]{.underline}**,]{.mark} but his [policies are liable to make
all rural Americans more vulnerable, and especially those with
disabilities. His ableist rhetoric,]{.underline} capitalizing on an
ableist culture, **[[will increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[structural ableism that already obtains in the United
States.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### A Trump re-election would be four more years of anti queer hell

**Johnson 2019**, (Chris Johnson is Chief Political & White House
Reporter for the Washington Blade. Johnson attends the daily White House
press briefings and is a member of the White House Correspondents\'
Association, 6/5/2019,
<https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/06/05/all-of-trumps-anti-lgbt-actions-since-last-pride-plus-a-few-welcome-moves/>,
7/17/2019, SG)

President Trump acknowledged Pride month via Twitter last week, but his
well wishes for the LGBT community fell on skeptical ears following the
extensive anti-LGBT actions of his administration. In just the year
since last Pride, **[[the tally of anti-LGBT actions from the Trump
administration dwarf the number of good things that have come from his
presidency for the LGBT community.]{.underline}]{.mark}** With Pride
celebrations underway, the Blade presents a list in no particular order
of Trump's positive and negative actions with direct impact on the LGBT
community since 2018's Pride celebration. (-) 1. **[[Embracing the
Masterpiece Cakeshop decision]{.underline}]{.mark}** When the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling last year in favor of Colorado
baker Jack Phillips, many observers saw the decision as limited. After
all, justices declined to find the First Amendment right Phillips
asserted to refuse to make custom-made wedding cakes for same-sex
couples. But the Trump administration fully embraced the decision as a
win for "religious freedom." White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders said the court "rightly concluded" the Colorado Civil Rights
Commission "failed to show tolerance and respect" for Phillips'
religious beliefs. Soon after, the Labor Department issued guidance to
ensure enforcement of LGBT non-discrimination rules complied with the
ruling's deference to religious freedom, even though the Trump
administration wasn't required to take that action. (-) 2. **[[White
House meeting with Ginni Thomas President Trump continues to meet with
anti-LGBT activists]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the White House, including
a recent high-profile discussion with Ginni Thomas, the wife of
conservative U.S. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas. The New York Times
reported Trump met in January with anti-LGBT activists led by Thomas in
the Roosevelt Room of the White House. As Trump was reportedly
"listening quietly," members of the group denounced transgender people
serving in the U.S. military. In addition to decrying transgender
military service, the anti-LGBT activists said women shouldn't serve in
the military "because they had less muscle mass and lung capacity than
men." They also said the Supreme Court ruling for marriage equality is
"harming the fabric of the United States" and sexual assault isn't
pervasive in the military, according to the New York Times. (-) 3.
Coming out against the Equality Act In the same week the U.S. House
voted to approve the Equality Act, legislation that would amend the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban anti-LGBT discrimination, Trump came out
against the bill. In an exclusive statement to the Blade, a senior
administration official said Trump opposes the Equality Act based on
unspecified "poison pill" amendments to the legislation. "The Trump
administration absolutely opposes discrimination of any kind and
supports the equal treatment of all; however, this bill in its current
form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and
conscience rights," the official said via email. (+) 4. AIDS advisory
council restaffed One year after firing all members of the Presidential
Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS without explanation as first reported by
the Blade, Trump restaffed the advisory body with 11 new appointees.
Carl Schmid, deputy director of the AIDS Institute, and John Wiesman,
secretary of health in Washington State, were named as co-chairs for the
advisory council. Months later, the Department of Health & Human
Services named nine additional members to PACHA from a variety of
professions, including the pharmaceutical industry, activism and
academia. (-) 5. **[[Trans military ban]{.underline}]{.mark}**
implemented After the U.S. Supreme Court essentially green lighted
Trump's ban on transgender people in the military, the Defense
Department implemented the policy in April. Denying the transgender ban
is, in fact, a ban, the policy prohibits anyone who has undergone gender
reassignment surgery from enlisting in the military and requires anyone
who identifies as transgender to serve in their biological sex (which
would be a small number of transgender people.) Although transgender
people who were already serving openly won an exemption, individuals who
are diagnosed in the future with gender dysphoria or obtain
transition-related care would be discharged. (-) 6. Brief against trans
protections under Title VII In a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court not
to take up a case seeking clarification on whether anti-trans
discrimination is a form of sex discrimination under federal law, the
Trump administration asserted the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
wrongly decided transgender people have protections under Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act. "The court of appeals' conclusion that
gender-identity discrimination categorically constitutes sex
discrimination under Title VII is incorrect," the filing says. "As
discussed above, the ordinary meaning of 'sex' does not refer to gender
identity...The court's position effectively broadens the scope of that
term beyond its ordinary meaning. Its conclusion should be rejected for
that reason alone." (-) 7. List of anti-LGBT appointments grows The U.S.
Senate continues to confirm Trump's appointments, many of whom have long
anti-LGBT records. The latest will reportedly be former Virginia
Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who once said homosexual acts are
"against nature and are harmful to society," for a position at the
Department of Homeland Security Other confirmations include U.S.
District Judge Howard Nielson of Utah, who as an attorney argued a gay
judge shouldn't be able to decide the case against California's
Proposition 8, and U.S. District Judge Chad Readler of Ohio, who as
acting assistant U.S. attorney general penned his name to briefs in
favor of the transgender military ban and against LGBT protections under
Title VII. (+) 8. But a few are from the LGBT community A handful of
Trump's appointments are from the LGBT community. Among them is former
Log Cabin Republicans executive director R. Clarke Cooper, whom Trump
appointed to a senior position at the State Department for
political-military affairs. The Senate confirmed Cooper in April. Other
new LGBT appointments are Mary Rowland, a lesbian with ties to the LGBT
group Lambda Legal whom Trump named to a federal judgeship in Illinois;
and Patrick Bumatay, a gay federal prosecutor whom Trump named for a
seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.
Both nominations are pending before the Senate. (-) 9. Draconian
anti-trans memo leaked An explosive report in the New York Times last
year exposed a planned memo within the Department of Health & Human
Services that would effectively erase transgender people from federal
law, igniting a massive outcry among transgender rights supporters. The
proposal reportedly asserts Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, which bars sex discrimination in schools, doesn't apply to
transgender people and calls for government agencies to adopt an
explicit and uniform definition of sex "on a biological basis that is
clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable." A dispute
about one's sex, the New York Times reported, would have to be clarified
using genetic testing. (-) 10. **[[Anti-trans 'conscience
rule']{.underline}]{.mark}** is final The memo as described by the Times
never came to light, but months later HHS did implement an anti-trans
"conscience rule" allowing health care providers to opt out of
procedures over which they have religious objections, including
abortions or gender reassignment surgery. Trump announced the rule was
final during a speech in the White House Rose Garden on the National Day
of Prayer. (-) 11. HHS seeks to undo trans health rule HHS wasn't done.
Weeks after the conscience rule was final, the department announced a
proposed rule seeking to undo regulations in health care against
anti-trans discrimination. The Obama-era regulations asserted Section
1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which bars sex discrimination in health
care, also covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Under
the Trump rule, HHS would disavow those protections. (The Obama-era rule
was already enjoined by a federal judge.) (-) 12. **[[Ending visas for
unmarried partners of diplomats]{.underline}]{.mark}** The State
Department last year cancelled visas for the unmarried same-sex partners
of diplomats to the United States. By canceling these visas for these
partners, the State Department forced these partners to either marry or
get out, which complicated matters if these diplomats are from countries
where same-sex marriage isn't legal. At the time of the decision, only
25 countries recognized same-sex marriage. (-) 13**[[. Proposal to gut
trans protections at homeless shelters]{.underline}]{.mark}** Despite
assurances from Secretary of Housing & Urban Development Ben Carson LGBT
non-discrimination rules for federally funded housing would remain in
place, HUD has proposed a rule that would gut transgender protections at
homeless shelters. The HUD proposal would allow homeless shelters with
sex-segregated facilities --- such as bathrooms or shared sleeping
quarters --- to establish policy consistent with state and local laws in
which operators consider a range of factors when determining where to
place individuals looking to stay, including "religious beliefs." (+)
14. **[[Trump announces HIV plan in State of the
Union]{.underline}]{.mark}** Trump in his State of the Union address
announced an initiative to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, asserting
"remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS" in recent years.
"Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within
reach," Trump said. "My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to
make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United
States within 10 years. We have made incredible strides. Incredible.
Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond." The plan seeks to
reduce new HIV diagnoses by 75 percent within five years, and by 90
percent within 10 years. Efforts will focus on 48 counties, D.C., and
San Juan, Puerto Rico and seven states where the epidemic is mostly in
rural areas. (+) 15. And the budget follows through with that request
Trump's budget request for fiscal year 2020 made good on his pledge in
the State of the Union address, seeking \$300 million in new funds for
domestic HIV programs. The bulk of the \$300 million figure is an
additional \$140 million requested for HIV prevention at the Centers for
Disease Control & Prevention, which is a 19 percent increase in its
overall budget from fiscal year 2019. The rest is \$70 million for the
Ryan White Health Care Program, \$50 million for PrEP services at HRSA
centers and \$25 million to screen for HIV and treat Hepatitis C. (-)
16. But NIH and global AIDS programs slashed But the same budget sought
to slash funds for the National Institutes for Health, which conducts
HIV research, and global AIDS programs like PEPFAR. Moreover, the plan
sought to make Medicaid a block-grant program, even though 40 percent of
people with HIV rely on it. Congress ended up rejecting the cuts, fully
funding NIH and global AIDS programs. (-) 17. Giving Pete Buttigieg
nickname of 'Alfred E. Neuman' Consistent with his track record of
giving his political opponents nicknames, Trump gave an unflattering
moniker to Pete Buttigieg, the gay presidential candidate with growing
support in the Democratic primary. Trump dubbed him "Alfred E. Neuman,"
the Mad Magazine character famous for the phrase, "What Me Worry?" In a
dog whistle that perhaps gay people could hear, Trump said, "Alfred E.
Neuman cannot become president of the United States." (+) 18.
Recognizing global initiative to end anti-gay laws In his tweet
recognizing June as Pride Month, Trump also acknowledged his global
initiative to decriminalize homosexuality. Currently, same-sex relations
are illegal in 71 countries. The project is spearheaded by U.S.
Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-ranking openly gay
person in the Trump administration. Previously, Trump seemed unaware of
the project. Asked about it by reporters, Trump said, "I don't know
which report you're talking about. We have many reports." (-) 19. **[[No
State Dept. recognition of Pride Month,]{.underline}]{.mark}** IDAHO In
contrast to Trump, the State Department in 2019 issued no statement
recognizing Pride Month, nor weeks before did it recognize the
International Day Against Homophobia & Transphobia. In 2018, Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo issued statements recognizing Pride Month and
IDAHO. Coming off a confirmation process in which he was criticized as
homophobic, Pompeo said "too many governments continue to arrest and
abuse their citizens simply for being lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender or intersex." (-) 20. Refusing to recognize birthright of
child to gay couple Consistent with the policy of cracking down on
immigration, the Trump administration refused to recognize the
birthright citizenship of the son of U.S.-citizen Andrew Dvash-Banks and
his Israeli husband Elad Dvash-Banks. The couple had two twin boys
conceived via a surrogate mother in Canada. The State Department,
however, required a DNA test to prove the children were related to the
couple to provide them U.S. passports. One child, Aiden, was deemed a
citizen because he's the biological son of Andrew, but the other, Ethan,
wasn't because he's the biological son of Elad. (-) 21. And appealed a
court ruling for the couple When the couple sued the Trump
administration, a court sided with the couple in granting birthright
citizenship to Ethan. However, the State Department refused to accept
the decision and appealed the ruling to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, where the case remains pending. A mediation document reveals
the State Department insists on its policy of "a biological relationship
between a U.S. citizen parent and a child born outside the United
States" to grant citizenship. (-) 22. **[[LGBT protections watered-down
in USMCA]{.underline}]{.mark}** An initial version of the USMCA trade
agreement with Canada and Mexico contained at the behest of Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau language a call for countries to adopt
policies "against sex-based discrimination, including on the basis of
sexual orientation and gender identity." But Trudeau publicly buckled
when asked about his commitment. After additional negotiations with the
Trump administration, a footnote was added to USMCA stating Title VII in
the United States, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex in the
workforce, was sufficient to meet the requirements of the deal. (-) 23.
DOJ's 'Religious Liberty Task Force' Before he was sacked by Trump,
former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions held a summit at the Justice
Department on religious freedom featuring Masterpiece Cakeshop's Jack
Phillips and Catholic leaders. At the summit, Sessions established the
Religious Liberty Task Force. The goal of the task force was to ensure
his memo on "religious freedom" --- widely seen as guidance in support
of anti-LGBT discrimination --- was being implemented throughout the
federal government. (+) 24. Hailing PrEP deal with Truvada as 'great
news' The Department of Health & Human Services reached a deal with
Gilead to make PrEP available for generic production one year earlier
and to secure a donation of the medication for up to 200,000 individuals
each year for up to 11 years. Trump took to Twitter to hail the
agreement: "Great news today: My administration just secured a historic
donation of HIV prevention drugs from Gilead to help expand access to
PrEP for the uninsured and those at risk. Will help us achieve our goal
of ending the HIV epidemic in America!" (-) 25. Deleting trans employee
guidance on OPM website In a little-noticed development over the
holidays, guidance on the Office of Personnel Management's website for
federal workers who are transgender was deleted without explanation. The
Obama-era guidance spelled out the definition of terms for transgender
identities and expectations for respecting transgender workers. The
guidance ensured transgender people could dress according to their
gender identity, be addressed by their preferred gender pronouns and use
restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity. (+)
26. U.S. joins OSCE in calling for Chechnya investigation Under the
Trump administration, the United States joined 15 allied countries at
the U.S. Organization for Security & Cooperation in Europe in the
creation of a probe to investigate alleged anti-gay human rights abuses
in Chechnya. The report concluded, as the United States and human rights
organizations long believed, Chechen government officials engaged in
human rights violations, including "harassment and persecution,
arbitrary or unlawful arrests or detentions, torture, enforced
disappearances and extrajudicial executions." Victims were LGBT people,
human rights defenders, journalists and members of civil society. (-)
27. But U.S. didn't sign U.N. statement against atrocities Months later,
the United States was nowhere to be found on a United Nations statement
signed by more than 30 countries calling for a thorough investigation of
the Chechnya atrocities. The State Department said the United States
didn't sign because it withdrew from the U.N. Human Rights Council "and
no longer participates in its sessions." (-) 28. State Department
proposes 'natural law' commission LGBT rights supporters are viewing
with skepticism a State Department proposal to create a "natural law"
commission, which is set to "provide fresh thinking about human rights
discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding
principles of natural law and natural rights." The term "natural law"
has been used to express condemnation of LGBT identities in religious
discourse. (-) 29. **[[Eliminating LGBT youth data question in foster
care]{.underline}]{.mark}** The Trump administration has proposed
eliminating requirements for case workers to ask LGBT youth in foster
care about their sexual orientation of youth for data collection
purposes. Although the Department of Health & Human Services concluded
it was "intrusive and worrisome," LGBT rights advocates say the
questions are necessary to ascertain disparities facing LGBT youth in
the foster care and adoption systems. (-) 30. **[[Trump stands with
anti-LGBT adoption agencies In a speech at the National Prayer
Breakfast,]{.underline}]{.mark}** Trump expressed solidarity with
religious-affiliated adoption agencies, who are bristling over LGBT
non-discrimination requirements to obtain federal funding. "My
administration is working to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies
are able to help vulnerable children find their forever families while
following their deeply held beliefs," Trump said. (-) 31. And
**[[defends Karen Pence teaching at anti-LGBT school In the same speech,
Trump also defended second lady Karen Pence for her decision to teach
art at a Christian school in Virginia,]{.underline}]{.mark}** which has
a policy against employing LGBT teachers or admitting LGBT students.
"She just went back to teaching art classes at a Christian school,"
Trump said, "Terrific woman."

#### Orientalism is the structuring force behind both anti-Semitism and Israeli oppression of Palestinians.

**Khazzoom 2003** \[Aziza, "The Great Chain of Orientalism: Jewish
Identity, Stigma Management, and Ethnic Exclusion in Israel" *American

Israel, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. She is the
author of *Shifting Ethnic Boundaries and Inequality in Israel, Or: How
the Polish Peddler Became a German Intellectual, *published by Stanford
University Press in 2008. The book focuses on why ethnic discrimination
occurred in Israel, and argues that concerns over producing the state as
western centrally determined who was excluded and who was included.

[ ]{.underline}

Several features of race and ethnicity are now abundantly clear to
sociologists. First, [racial and ethnic boundaries are mutable social
constructions]{.underline}. Second, they are relational constructs in
the describing a "self" by implication describes an "other." Third,
these moving boundaries that form ethnic groups are real in their
consequences as they are fundamental building blocks of social
hierarchies. But while sociologists care about shifting boundaries
largely because they are so often related to exclusion, precisely this
connection between boundaries and exclusion has received little
empirical attention. Currently, the literatures on immigration and
racialization are concerned primarily with charting the process by which
group boundaries are created, strengthened, or weakened. Within this
work it is not always clear why definitional moves are initiated, why
boundaries take a particular form when others are available, or how the
emergence of ethnic *inequality.* Here, I use one instance of rapid
transformation in ethnic boundaries to explore these issues.
[Contemporary Jewish Israeli society was formed in the 1950s as the
result of a massive immigration of Jews from many
countries.]{.underline} Despite significant heterogeneity among the
immigrants, a bifurcated social structure emerged in which [Ashkenazim
(European, primarily East European Jews) were the dominant group and
Mizrahim]{.underline} (Middle Eastern and North African Jews) were
subordinate (Amit 2001; Nahon 1987). It has been argued that **[[one of
the ways Ashkenazim acquired their domination of Jewish Israeli society
was to "Orientalize"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mizrahim. That is,
**[[Ashkenazim used the previously-existing east/west dichotomy to
advance a binary construction of ethnicity in Israel in which the
heterogeneity of the arriving cultures was simplified into
two,]{.underline}]{.mark}** homogeneous categories: Ashkenazim, who were
fully "eastern" (Shohat 1988, 1989). The bifurcation in the realm of
representation, it is argued, both shaped and justified an unequal
distribution of resources (Bernstein and Swirski 1982). As a result,
[the binary ethnic division has become entrenched, that that across a
range of important contexts Israel ethnic groups.]{.underline} **[[The
imposition of new ethnic boundaries in Israel was clearly a first step
in the process of exclusion]{.underline}.]{.mark}** However, the
dynamics most often invoked to explain these moves- competition for
scarce material resources and he natural tendency to help one's own-
cannot account for the choice of these particular ethnic boundaries over
others or for their emergence as central aces of exclusion. [I
**[suggest that a far better explanation lies in an expanded and
historicized account of orientalism in the Jewish
world.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Based on a review of secondary source
materials, and building on the works of Goffman (1963) and Said (1978),
I argue that [the past two centuries of Disapora Jewish history in
Europe and the Middle East can be conceptualized as a series of
orientalizations.]{.underline} [**[Through the history, Jews came to
view Jewish tradition as oriental, developed intense commitments to
westernization as a form of self-improvement, and became threatened by
elements of Jewish culture that represented the oriental
past.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Self-classification then drove how others
were classified- perceived levels of [westernization became the primary
determinant for evaluation other Jewish communities]{.underline}, and

Americanizing the Middle East [The Middle East began to loom larger on
America's diplomatic and cultural horizon]{.underline} during what Mark
Twain called "the Gilded Age," [not only because **[U.S. missionaries
sought to save more souls]{.mark}** but also because **[U.S. merchants
sought to expand trade]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** By the 1870s
American entrepreneurs were buying nearly one-half of Turkey's opium
crop for resale in China while providing the Ottoman Empire with
everything from warships to kerosene. "Even the sacred lamps over the
Prophet's tomb at Mecca," one U.S. diplomat gloated in 1879, "are fed
with oil from Pennsylvania."19 Meanwhile a new generation of American
missionaries made their way to Armenia, Syria, and other corners of the
Ottoman realm, spreading not only the gospel but also subversive New
World ideas. Indeed, by the 1890s two in- stitutions of higher learning
established by U.S. missionaries three decades earlier ---Robert College
just outside Constantinople and the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut
--- had become notorious anti-Turkish hotbeds, where Arabs, Kurds, and
Armenians began to dream of and scheme for national independ- ence.20
"Quite without intention," British orientalist and adventurer T. E.
Lawrence observed a generation later, these two colleges had actually
"taught revolution" to subject peoples throughout the Turkish empire.21
While most U.S. observers seem to have agreed that the Christians of Ar-
menia and Syria might profit enormously from these lessons, few
churchmen or diplomats expected such revolutionary teachings to spell
anything but dis- aster in the Muslim world. When angry mobs of Iranian
students and peas- ants toppled the royal government and forced the shah
to proclaim a consti- tutional monarchy in August 1906, for example,
Ambassador Richmond Pearson offered a bleak forecast laced with
orientalism: "History does not re- cord a single instance of successful
constitutional government in a country where the Mussulman religion is
the state religion."22 Ambassador John Leish- man, Pearson's counterpart
in Constantinople, was no more sanguine about the prospects for
constitutional rule in Turkey, where reformist military officers ---"the
Young Turks"--- staged a coup and curbed the sultan's powers in July
1908. "The fanatical element" among Muslim students, soldiers, and
mullahs, Leishman reported nine months later, had triggered
antigovernment riots, an army mutiny, and "a reign of terror and a
succession of murders."23 [President Theodore Roosevelt,]{.underline}
who had appointed both Pearson and Leish- man, [was even more skeptical
about the possibility of reform and progress in the Middle East. A firm
believer in a hierarchy of race in which "civilized na-]{.underline} 14

shoulder "the White Man's Burden" and at- tempt to westernize the
"benighted" peoples of Asia,]{.mark}** Africa, and Latin Amer-
ica,]{.underline} [Roosevelt confessed]{.underline} privately in 1907
that ["it is impossible to expect moral, intellectual and material
well-being where Mohammedanism is su- preme]{.underline}." The
Egyptians, for example, were "a people of Moslem fellahin who have never
in all time exercised any self-government whatever." Britain's Lord
Cromer, Roosevelt added, "is one of the greatest modern colonial
administra- tors, and he has handled Egypt just according to Egypt's
needs"--- military oc- cupation, foreign tutelage, and Christian
patience.24 [**[If Roosevelt ranked Muslims near the bottom of his
hierarchy of race, he placed Jews closer to the
top]{.underline}**.]{.mark} To be sure, like many other members of the
pa- trician elite that still ruled America at the turn of the century[[,
**Roosevelt har- bored some patronizingly offensive stereotypes of
Jewish Americans.**]{.underline}]{.mark}25 But he was also highly
critical of the wave of anti-Semitism that swept Turkey and Russia
during the First World War, and he was an early supporter of the idea of
establishing a Jewish state in the Holy Land. The United States and its
al- lies, Roosevelt observed in July 1918, should "pledge themselves
never to make peace until the Turk is driven from Europe, and . . . the
Jews \[are\] given control of Palestine." It seemed, he added two months
later, "entirely proper to start a Zionist State around Jerusalem."26
[As the war to end all wars drew to a close, the establishment of a
Jewish homeland in Palestine had become a goal widely shared on both
sides of the Atlantic]{.underline}. Famous mainly for its biblical ruins
and its fruit exports, Palestine had until very recently remained little
more than a sleepy backwater con- trolled by the dying Ottoman Empire.
Overwhelmingly Muslim, Palestine had counted just 25,000 Jews among a
total population of 300,000 as late as 1880.27 Fifteen years later,
however, Theodore Herzl, a thirty-five-year-old Jewish
lawyer-turned-journalist born in Budapest, published what might be
called the first Zionist manifesto. [Outraged by the pogroms in Russia
and Poland and appalled by the resurgence of anti-Semitism]{.underline}
farther west in France, [Herzl warned]{.underline} his brethren in the
pages of *The Jewish State* that [only by es- tablishing a national home
in Palestine could they be safe from persecution.]{.underline} Working
tirelessly, Herzl brought together Jews from seventeen countries, in-
cluding the United States, in Basel, Switzerland, where in August 1897
they founded the World Zionist Organization committed to accelerating
Jewish im- migration to Palestine by purchasing land from the Arabs.
**[[Zionist efforts bore fruit in short order and helped swell the
Jewish community in Palestine to 85,000]{.underline},]{.mark}** 12
percent of the total population, on the eve of the First World War.28

As [enthusiasm for a Jewish state in Palestine faded at the White House
and at Whitehall]{.underline} during the 1920s, an upsurge of nativism
eroded support on Main Street for the Zionist dream. From Atlanta to
Anaheim the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses and staged rallies to intimidate
African Americans, Cath- olics, and Jews, while on the banks of the
Potomac Congress was erecting re- strictive quotas to stem the flow of
Jews and other "undesirable" groups from Eastern Europe. [Fearful that a
Zionist success in Palestine might inadvertently call into question the
loyalty of the entire Jewish community in the United States,
**[influential American Jews]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as *New York

convincing the State De- partment's elitist and sometimes anti-Semitic
Middle Eastern experts that they could safely ignore this first Jewish
foray into interest group politics.44 By late 1936 [the State
Department's Wallace Murray had convinced his supe- riors to do nothing
that might "entangle us in any other way in the most del- icate problem
of Palestine]{.underline}."45 Murray's brief for [U.S. noninvolvement
could not have come at a worse time for American Zionists or their
comrades in Europe]{.underline}. Claiming that **[[the influx of 250,000
European Jews during the decade and a half since the First World War was
more than the overloaded Palestinian economic and political system could
bear]{.underline},]{.mark}** in 1936 **[[the Arabs launched a violent
revolt to resist Zion- ism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** While Palestinian
militias battled the Haganah, the Jewish underground army, in the
streets of Jerusalem and the foothills of Nablus, even more omi- nous
events were unfolding in Germany, where Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic
policies were growing ever more blatant. Since coming to power in early
1933 the Nazi dictator had tarred German Jews with the brush of
communism, stripped them of their civil rights, and branded them
scapegoats for the Third Reich's economic woes. After Nazi tanks rolled
into Vienna in March 1938 and after Hitler's storm troopers went on an
anti-Semitic rampage in Berlin eight months later, thousands of German
and Austrian Jews sought refuge abroad, some in Britain and America, but
most in Palestine.46 [At the time when European Jewry was most desperate
for a safe haven in a national homeland,]{.underline} however, [the
British government moved to reduce Jewish immigration to Palestine
sharply.]{.underline} Having just completed a costly two-year campaign
to suppress the Arab revolt, Whitehall issued a White Paper on 17 May
1939 limiting the total number of Jewish refugees permitted to enter the
Holy Land to just 75,000 during the next five years; after that, all
further im- migration would be subject to Palestinian approval. Among
the most outspo- ken critics of the 1939 White Paper was
fifty-three-year-old David Ben Gu- rion, the charismatic unofficial
leader of the Yishuv, as the 350,000-member Jewish community in
Palestine was now known. Convinced that persuading Whitehall to rescind
the White Paper would prove an exercise in futility, Ben Gurion and his
comrades hoped American Zionists might be more successful at the White
House, where [Franklin D. Roosevelt was preparing to seek an
unprecedented third term with support from Jewish
liberals]{.underline}.47 Long sympathetic to the aims of the Balfour
Declaration, fdr was clearly troubled during the late 1930s by signs
that Britain intended to repudiate its commitment to a Jewish homeland.
"I was at Versailles," he recalled in 1938, "and I know that the British
made no secret of the fact that they promised Palestine to the Jews. Why
are they now reneging on their promise?"48 Bri- 20 orientalism, american
style tain's actions during the spring of 1939 only raised more
questions. "I have read with interest and a good deal of dismay the
decisions of the British Gov- ernment regarding its Palestine policy,"
he told Secretary of State Cordell Hull in mid-May. "This White Paper,"
Roosevelt hastened to add, "is something that we cannot give approval
to."49 During the following eighteen months well-connected Zionists such
as Stephen Wise and Felix Frankfurter, whom fdr had recently tapped to
fill Brandeis's seat on the Supreme Court, quietly encouraged the
president to press Whitehall to honor its commitments re- garding
Palestine. At the State Department, however, Hull and his advisers in-
sisted that U.S. meddling would only serve to undermine the U.K.
position in the Middle East at a time when Britain, in the wake of the
fall of France in June 1940, was the sole remaining barrier to complete
Nazi domination of Eu- rope. Judging geopolitical considerations to be
more important than domestic politics, Roosevelt kept his doubts about
the White Paper to himself and still managed to win a third term by a
healthy margin.50 Thousands of European Jews unable to find refuge
abroad would soon be among the earliest victims of the Holocaust. During
1939 and 1940 the Nazis had targeted the Jewish population of occupied
Europe for relocation to con- centration camps in Poland. After the
German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, agents of the Gestapo,
Hitler's secret police, began systematically to murder all Russian Jews
who fell into their hands. By the time that Ger- many's Japanese allies
attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, rumors of the Gestapo's
anti-Semitic butchery were already filtering into the United States. In
January 1942 Hitler formally approved a "final solution for the Jewish
problem" and authorized the Schutzstaffel, or SS, an elite corps of the
German army whose commanders spoke with the voice of Cain, to begin the
wholesale extermination of hundreds of thousands of Jews then imprisoned
at Ausch- witz, Buchenwald, and other concentration camps. During the
next three years nearly 6 million Jewish men, women, and children would
die.51 The unspeakable slaughter unfolding in Nazi-occupied Europe
removed any remaining doubts among most American Jews about the
importance of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In May 1942, 600 American
Zionists gathered at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City and passed a
unanimous resolution de- manding "that Palestine be established as a
Jewish Commonwealth integrated in the structure of the new democratic
world." While insiders such as Stephen Wise sought to win White House
support for the Biltmore declaration, out- siders like Abba Hillel
Silver, a fiery Cleveland rabbi born in Lithuania and ed- ucated at
Hebrew Union College, founded the American Zionist Emergency Council,
whose 200 local chapters funneled a half-million dollars into national
headquarters to finance a lobbying effort in Washington.52 [**[Nineteen

\"[In contemporary writing about nineteenth-century photography of the
Middle East]{.underline},\" writes Michelle L. Woodward, \"[it has
become al- most a cliché to describe many oftheseimages as
\'Orientalist\'---that is, reflecting or propagating a system of
representation that creates an essentialized difference between the
\'Orient\' and the \'West\'\"]{.underline}(363). This claim aptly
captures the predominant anti-Saidian sentiment [among art historians
and curators who work on representations of the Middle East created by
both European and indigenous painters and photographers]{.underline}. To
be sure, responses to [Said\'s discussion of Oriental- ism as a
discourse of colonial power span the critical spectrum, from more
rigorous and subtle critiques articulated from the left to the sometimes
facile and reactionary from those of an opposing political
orientation]{.underline}. On one side are art historians such as Zeynep
Çelik, Jill Beaulieu and Mary Roberts, and Woodward who argue that \"the
trend to extend Said\'s analysis to apply equally to visual
representations has . . . been used too broadly, obscuring nuances and
inconsistencies, not only between different photographers\' bodies of
work but also within them\" (Woodward 363). These scholars typically aim
to con- structively revise Orientalism to encompass \"a disparate and
disputed set of discursive constructions\" while at the same time
acknowledging \"Orientals\" as \"participants in the production of
counternarratives or resistant images\" (Bealieu and Roberts 3). On the
other side are writ- ers, such as John MacKenzie and Ken Jacobson, who
betray a marked suspicion of theory and seek to return the term
\"Orientalism\" to its prior usage as an art historical term that could
be deployed without suggestion of a broader political or ideological
critique. In Orientalism: History, Theory, and the Arts, MacKenzie
argues against Linda Nochlin that \"there is little evidence of a
necessary coherence between the imposition of direct imperial rule and
the visual arts,\" claiming that \"Orientalism celebrates cultural
proximity, historical parallelism and religious familiarity \[with the
Middle East and North Africa\] rather than true \'Otherness\'\" (51).
Given such perceived \"misconceptions inherent in postcolonialist
analysis,\" Jacobson similarly suggests that \"a return to more
traditional methods is desirable for the study of 19th- and early
20th-century photography in North Africa and the Near East,\" urging
commentators to focus more single-mindedly on the \"notable aesthetic,
as well as documentary and historical merit\" when analyzing visual
representations (88). In what follows, [I argue that Orientalism should
not be under- stood merely as an ideological discourse of power nor as a
neutral art historical term, but rather as a network of aesthetic,
economic, and political relationships that cross national and historical
boundaries]{.underline}. Understood in this way, [Orientalism is
indispensible to understanding nineteenth-century photography of the
Middle East]{.underline}. Whether consid- ered in the context of their
production and dissemination in the nine- teenth century or in relation
to their current afterlives as collectable objects or archives,
[photographs of the Orient become meaningful and legible only if they
are considered in terms of the specific geopolitical distinctions,
economic interests, and cultural assumptions about the Middle
Eas]{.underline}t and its people. While insisting that Orientalism
offers a crucial perspective from which to comprehend the meaning and
significance of photographic representations of the Middle East, I do
not mean to suggest that such images should be understood merely as a
reflection of Europeans\' racial prejudice against \"Orientals,\" or
that these images simply validate European imperial dominance over the
region. Nor would I wish to argue that Orientalist photography entails a
binary visual structure between the Europeans as active agents and
\"Orientals\" as passive objects of representation. Rather, I hope to
provide an alternative view of [Orientalistphotography]{.underline} that
focuses on nodes and ties that bind artists, collectors, and museums
across historical and national boundaries, which are productive of a
distinctly exotic vision of the region, [a vision at once embraced and
perpetuated by the elite in the Middle East]{.underline} .Indigenous
photography in and of itself, I maintain, does not constitute an
oppositional locus or resistant iconography, for it too belongs to the
Orientalist network that mediates its vocabulary and thematics of
representation.1 A network theory of Orientalism concerns itself neither
with the motivations of individual artists nor with the attributes of
art objects, but instead studies the symmetric and asymmetric relations
between discrete objects, specific individuals, and concrete practices.

#### The alternative is to vote negative to construct the ballot as a counter-script against the orientalist discourses of the affirmative. This is key to generating space for subjectivities outside of the construction of the West.

**[But Orientalism, as a symbolic revolt, was not just about the
critique, deconstruction and exposure of ideological and epistemological
Eurocentric frameworks that monopolised the realm of discursive
production]{.underline}**. Appropriating Michel Foucault's postulation
that power is everywhere and that it is diffused and embodied in
discourse, knowledge and "regimes of truth", Said presents the second
mode of critique; namely, Orientalism as the ontological nature,
structure and a priori condition of power. In this sense, **[[knowledge
or the historical materialisation of specific Nietzschean truths were a
form of power and power could only be deciphered through critiquing its
manufactured meta-narrative and mapping out the transmutation and
movement of its anthropomorphisms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, metaphors and
metonymies. Said demonstrates this through examining Sylvester de Sacy's
role in the Dacier Report (1802). Conducted for examining the state of
Orientalist learning, the report was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte.
Said writes: The importance of the Tableau historique for an
understanding of Orientalism's inaugural phase is that it exteriorizes
the form of Orientalist knowledge and its features, as it also describes
the Orientalist's relationship to his subject matter. In Sacy's pages on
Orientalism ... he speaks of his own work as having uncovered, brought
to light, rescued a vast amount of obscure matter. Why? In order to
place it before the student. For like all his learned contemporaries
Sacy considered a learned work a positive addition to an edifice that
all scholars erected together. Knowledge was essentially the making
visible of material, and the aim of a tableau was the construction of a
sort of Benthamite panopticon. Scholarly discipline was therefore a
specific technology of power ...(1978, 127).3 Elsewhere in his analysis
of Arthur James Balfour's speech in the House of Commons on the 13 June
1910, Said declares: England knows Egypt; Egypt is what England knows;
England knows that Egypt cannot have self-government; England confirms
that by occupying Egypt; for the Egyptians, Egypt is what England has
occupied and now governs; foreign occupation therefore becomes "the very
basis" of contemporary Egyptian civilization; Egypt requires, indeed,
insists upon British occupation (1978, 34). In other words, Said
postulated that **[Orientalism exuded epistemic violence through its
inherent relation with European colonial power. And, in turn, European
colonial power could only dominate the region through Orientalism
functioning as a technique and instrument of power.]{.underline}** Here
then Said's third definition of Orientalism, drawing from the two
previous epistemological definitions, demonstrates the intrinsically
dialectical relation between knowledge and power. Said posits
Orientalism is also: (3) The corporate institution for dealing with the
Orient---dealing with it by making statements about it, authorizing
views of it, describing it, by teaching it, settling it, ruling over it:
in short, Orientalism as a Western style for dominating, restructuring,
and having authority over the Orient Collectively Said conceptualises
Orientalism as epistemological (both as a corpus of scholarly writings
and a historical system of thought) and ontological (as in the nature of
being, the structure and condition of power). Read critically, for Said
the synthesis of Western power and knowledge had a singular ontological
and teleological purpose; namely, the thingification or subjectivation
of the colonized Oriental subject. This point is best demonstrated by
William D. Hart's analysis of Orientalism: In his description of
discourse, Said appropriates Foucault's ideas of discipline and
power/knowledge. By discipline, Foucault \[and by default Said\] means
those methods of modern punitive power that establishes meticulous
control over the body, assuring its constant subjection by imposing a
relation of "docility-utility". Discipline, that is, makes human bodies
docile and useful \[thingifies\], and advertises their availability for
political, economic, and cultural uses of many kinds (2000, 70). And
what of the latter Said's "voyage in" and the powerful transformative
attempt by the native to "write back" in the metropolis? Can this
"contrapuntal reading" (Said 1994a, 288, 79), allow a discursive space
where the native-intellectual, halfinvolved and half-detached (Said
1996), rejects the "hail" and the Althusserian "quadruple system" of
interpellation (Althusser 1969)? Does the deliberate attempt in Said's
words to "enter into the discourse of Europe and the West, to mix with
it, transform it, to make it acknowledge marginalized or suppressed or
forgotten history" (Said 1994, 260) effect this equation? This
**[[latter Said, moving away from Foucauldian discursive
formation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and utilizing Gramsci's hegemony or
direzione culturale \[cultural direction\], **[[envisions social space
alike a Bourdieuean field. Revalorizing culture, political space becomes
an arena where subjects engage in competent action and deploy different
modes of capital and strategies in order to advance their position
within the framework of a shared system of
meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Bourdieu 1977). In this sense, Said
announces in Culture and Imperialism (1994a) that "... no matter how
apparently complete the dominance of an ideology or social system, there
are always going to be parts of the social experience that it does not
cover and control. From these parts very frequently comes opposition
both self-conscious and dialectical" (Said 1994, 289). Accordingly, Said
posits that the ["**[new receptivity to both liberation

only challenges the "monopoly of discourse by Eurocentric intellectuals
and politicians"]{.underline}** (Said 1994, 316), **[but also [creates a

[[Senators voted 56-41 to recommend that the U.S. stop supporting the
war in Yemen]{.mark}, a direct affront to the administration's war
powers abilities.]{.underline} Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of
Vermont, who co-sponsored the Yemen resolution with Republican Sen. Mike
Lee of Utah, called passage a "historic moment." Lee said Khashoggi's
death focused attention "on the fact that we have been led into this
civil war in Yemen half a world away" and "we've done so following the
lead" of Saudi Arabia. "What the Khashoggi event did was to demonstrate,
hey, maybe this isn't a regime that we should just be following that
eagerly into battle," Lee said. [As Senate approval loomed, the
administration dispatched Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to the
House to make the case against the resolutions and warn of damage they
could do to the U.S.-Saudi relationship. A congressional aide and an
administration official said their appearance was aimed at stopping any
House action on the resolutions]{.underline}. Pompeo and Mattis had made
a similar entreaty to the Senate late last month. [But it was roundly
panned by senators angered by the secretaries' refusal to accept a CIA
determination that assessed the crown prince had ordered Khashoggi's
murder]{.underline}. CIA Director Gina Haspel briefed House leaders
Wednesday on the Khashoggi slaying. The journalist, who had lived in the
U.S. and wrote for The Washington Post, had been critical of the Saudi
regime. He was killed in what U.S. officials have described as an
elaborate plot as he visited the consulate for marriage paperwork. Saudi
prosecutors have said a 15-man team sent to Istanbul killed Khashoggi
and then dismembered his body, which has not been found. Those findings
came after Saudi authorities spent weeks denying Khashoggi had been
killed in the consulate. Trump has been reluctant to condemn the crown
prince. He said the United States "intends to remain a steadfast
partner" of the country, touted Saudi arms deals worth billions of
dollars to the U.S. and thanked the Saudis for plunging oil prices. But
Graham and Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations
Committee, have rejected Trump's economic arguments. They are setting
the stage for legislation next year that goes further in halting arms
sales and taking other measures. Menendez says [economic concerns do not
overpower human rights and the U.S. must send a "global message that
killing with impunity" will not be tolerated]{.underline}. Frustration
with the crown prince and the White House prompted several Republicans
to support the Yemen resolution. Seven Republicans and all Democrats
voted for it. Some already had concerns about the war, which human
rights groups say is wreaking havoc on the country and subjecting
civilians, many of them children, to deadly disease and indiscriminate
bombing. [[The resolution condemning Saudi Arabia]{.mark} for
Khashoggi's slaying [was from]{.mark} Senate Foreign Relations Chairman
Bob [Corker and]{.mark} Senate Majority Leader Mitch [McConnell]{.mark}.
Both Republicans opposed the Yemen resolution and voted against it.
McConnell said senators have grave concerns about Khashoggi's killing,
but "we also want to preserve a 70-year partnership between the United
States and Saudi Arabia, and we want to ensure it continues to serve
American interests and stabilizes a dangerous and critical
region]{.underline}." [But [McConnell encouraged passage of the
Khashoggi resolution and said it provided "a clear]{.mark} and
unambiguous [message about how we feel about what happened to this
journalist]{.mark}." The Senate debate came as the United Nations
secretary general announced that Yemen's warring sides have agreed to a
province-wide cease-fire and withdrawal of troops in Hodeida, a
contested Red Sea port city]{.underline}. The agreement came during
peace talks in Sweden. The brutal four-year-old civil war pits the
internationally recognized Yemeni government, supported by a Saudi-led
coalition, against the Iran-backed rebels known as Houthis.

[Canadian Prime Minister Justin [Trudeau]{.mark} on Sunday [said Canada
is]{.mark} looking into [ending sales of]{.mark} armored vehic[les to
Saudi Arabia as pressure builds following the murder of U.S.-based
journalist Jamal Khashoggi]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"We are engaged with
the export permits to try and see if there is a way of no longer
exporting these vehicles to Saudi Arabia," Trudeau told Canadian
television network CTV, according to The Globe and Mail. Trudeau\'s
comments come after he said in October that he was unlikely to cancel
the sales. "I do not want to leave Canadians holding a billion-dollar
bill because we're trying to move forward on doing the right thing,\" he
said of the Saudi deal at the time. But [Canada and other
[countries]{.mark} [have faced increased pressure to end]{.mark} arms
[sales]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia [following the murder of
Khashoggi]{.mark} and amid criticism of the deadly civil war in
Yemen]{.underline}. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was killed
inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October. The CIA has
reportedly concluded with high confidence that Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing. The U.S. has faced pressure to
end its own arm sales to Saudi Arabia since the slaying, but President
Trump has maintained that he will not do so. Trump, who has refused to
condemn Saudi Arabia or the crown prince over the killing of Khashoggi,
has said that ending those sales would result in significant job losses
in the U.S.

During the G20 summit earlier this month, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad
bin Salman met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the meeting,
[[Putin announced that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed to extend an
oil production cut agreement for another nine
months]{.underline}]{.mark}. When the extension was formalized several
days later, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo touted the deal as
a "Catholic marriage" and boasted that it would last an "eternity." Such
cooperation between the two countries would have surprised many
international observers just a few years ago. Back then, Saudi Arabia
and Russia appeared headed for showdown over Syria and global oil
prices. Now however, one of America's closest allies in the Middle East
and one of its leading adversaries are increasingly finding common
ground. [[At a time when many foreign investors are leaving Russia,
Saudi Arabia is investing billions of dollars into the Russian
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, Saudi Arabia and Russia are
increasingly coordinating to influence global oil prices. In a few
instances, Saudi Arabia has even sided with Russia over the United
States. For example, [[Riyadh has publicly opposed further U.S.
sanctions against Moscow and abstained from several UN votes condemning
Russian actions in Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} (RELATED: Saudi Arabia
Is Trying To Execute And Possibly Crucify Teen Who Participated In
Protest When He Was 10 Years Old: Report) Dmitry Frolovsky, an
independent Moscow-based geopolitical analyst, told The Daily Caller
that the current level of cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia is
"unprecedented." "The convergence with Saudi Arabia over the past
several years in many ways is surprising even to Russian strategists
because no one expected that Russia's campaign in Syria could help
improve relations with the Persian Gulf monarchies so much," he said.
Riyadh and Moscow have historically had a contentious relationship. As
recently as 2013, Saudi Intelligence head Prince Bandar bin Sultan tried
to persuade Putin to alter his position on Syria by raising the prospect
of terrorism at the Sochi Olympics games, according to a report from The
Telegraph. However, the Obama administration's foreign policy in the
Middle East made Saudi Arabia rethink its approach to Moscow. Riyadh was
alarmed by the Obama administration's favorable reception of the Arab
Spring, which swept away several prominent pro-American dictators in the
region. When the United States signed the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, the
kingdom regarded the move as a betrayal. On the other hand, Russia's
military intervention in Syria left a strong impression on Saudi Arabia.
[[Thus, at a time when Saudi Arabia sought to hedge its bets against
Washington, Russia seemed likely a formidable
option]{.underline}.]{.mark} In 2016, Saudi Arabia and Russia signed
their first deal on limiting oil production to combat falling energy
prices. Saudi King Salman visitedMoscow the subsequent year, becoming
the first Saudi monarch to set foot in Russia. [[Economics is
increasingly at the forefront of Saudi-Russia
cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} While many Western investors shunned
Russia after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Riyadh instead expanded its
portfolio in the country. In 2015, Saudi Arabia pledged to invest \$10
billion into the Russian economy. A quarter of that sum has been
invested so far. Last October, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund
became a partner of a Russo-Chinese investment fund and contributed
\$500 million to the project. That month Saudi Arabia also promised to
provide \$5 billion for an LNG project in the Arctic by Russian gas
company Novatek. Some in Moscow are optimistic that 2019 could be a
breakthrough year for Saudi investment in Russia. Kirill Dmitriev CEO of
Russia's sovereign wealth fund, recently told Saudi website Argaam that
Russia and Saudi Arabia were exploring investing \$2 billion this year
on 25 different joint projects. Alexey Khlebnikov, a Middle East expert
at the Russian International Affairs Council stated that Saudi
investments help provide Russia with relief from Western sanctions.
"They do not fully take away the pain \[of Western sanctions\], they do
not fully resolve the problem," he said. "But it is one of the
alternative sources of foreign direct investment into the Russian
economy." Khlebnikov added, "There is big potential, in the future
\[Saudi investment\] is likely to increase because the dynamics are
favorable." However, Yuri Barmin, Middle East and North Africa Director
at Moscow Policy Group, offered a more pessimistic assessment about the
long-term prospects for further Saudi investment in Russia. "The problem
is that the Saudis are very conservative investors and Russia
politically is a very risky market to invest in," he said. Saudi
Arabia's economic interests in Russia have made it wary of U.S. efforts
to increase pressure on the country. In March, Saudi Minister of Energy
Khalid Al-Falih publicly opposed a new proposed U.S. sanctions package
targeting Moscow. "Russia is a big supplier of gas to Europe, oil to
China. If \[new sanctions\] happen, it will affect Europe, China and the
whole world," the minister stated. Saudi Arabia is also increasingly
reluctant to criticize Russian foreign policy. In December 2017 and
2018, the kingdom abstained from two UN General Assembly resolutions
condemning Russia conduct towards Ukraine. This move marked a sharp
change of policy. As late as 2016, Saudi Arabia had supported similar
resolutions. For its part, [[Russia has defended Saudi Arabia from
international criticism over the kingdom's feud with Canada and the
killing of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Khlebnikov explained that Riyadh and Moscow have an unspoken
understanding to not criticize one-another's foreign policy. (RELATED:
Behind The Growing Rift Between Russia And Iran) "Russia avoids offering
commentary and condemnations of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, and Saudi
Arabia likewise takes a neutral position towards Russian policy in
Ukraine," he said. Despite the improved relations between Russia and
Saudi Arabia, all the Russian experts The Daily Caller spoke to
emphasized that the two countries remained far away from a partnership.
Saudi Arabia and Russia still have numerous conflicts of interest.
Moreover, Riyadh's alliance with Washington and Moscow's strong ties
with Tehran limit the ability of both countries to become fully-fledged
partners. So far, however, [the two countries have managed to draw
closer together despite their differences. All the more is impressive is
how far this surprising development has fallen under the
radar.]{.underline} At a time when Saudi Arabia has successfully pushed
Washington to get more involved against Iran, it has also made
significant inroads with a top global competitor of the United States.
[By upping its Russia investments and striking oil deals with Moscow,
Riyadh has helped the Kremlin avoid international isolation and
strengthen its economy.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia and Russia may not be
headed for a partnership, but [Washington is unlikely to welcome the
current trajectory of their relationship.]{.underline}

Of course it does not follow from the enormous benefits of growth that
the world is perfect. Far from it. But **[what we need is more
growth]{.underline}**, rather than less, **[to overcome the remaining
challenges. Take the example of climate change]{.underline}**. The
conventional green-tinged view is that we need to limit economic growth
to stop us destroying the planet. From this perspective the emphasis
must be on individual consumers making sacrifices by consuming less.
Such an approach could not be more wrong. **[To tackle climate
change]{.underline}**, to the extent it is a problem, **[we need more
resources and better technology rather than less.]{.underline}** **[For
example, we can construct more nuclear power stations, build higher sea
walls to resist flooding and investigate more high technology solutions.
We need an investment in practical engineering-based
solution]{.underline}**s rather than cheap moralising by politicians and
pundits. **[The end of scarcity is a precondition for human beings to
achieve the good life. Economic growth]{.underline}**, and social
progress more generally, **[is central to the full realisation of our
humanity.]{.underline}**

**Elitist backlash to transition will kill billions**

Most critics would argue, probably correctly, that [instead of allowing
underdeveloped countries to withdraw from the global economy and
undermine the economies of the developed world, the United States,
Europe, and Japan and others will fight neocolonial wars to force these
countries to remain within this collapsing global economy.]{.underline}
These [neocolonial wars will result in mass death, suffering, and even
regional nuclear wars]{.underline}. If First World countries choose
military confrontation and political repression to maintain the global
economy, then [[we may see mass death and genocide on a global scale
that will make the deaths of World War II pale]{.mark} in
comparison]{.underline}. However, these [[neocolonial wars, fought to
maintain the developed nations' economic and political hegemony,
will]{.underline}]{.mark} cause the final
[[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} of our [[global]{.underline}]{.mark}
industrial [[civilization]{.mark}. These wars will so damage the complex
economic and trading networks and squander material, biological, and
energy resources that they will undermine the global economy and its
ability to support the earth's 6 to 8 billion people]{.underline}. This
would be the worst-case scenario for the collapse of global
civilization.

elimination of the ecological crisis.

Left out of the ensuing tangle of commentary on race and class has been
the increasing impoverishment \-- or, we should say, re-impoverishment
\-- of African Americans as a group. In fact, [the most salient and
lasting effect of the current recession may turn out to be the
decimation of the black middle class]{.underline}. According to a study
by Demos and the Institute for Assets and Social Policy, 33 percent of
the black middle class was already in danger of falling out of the
middle class at the start of the recession. Gates and Obama, along with
Oprah and Cosby, will no doubt remain in place, but millions of the
black equivalents of Officer Crowley \-- from factory workers to bank
tellers and white collar managers \-- are sliding down toward
destitution. [For African Americans \-- and to a large extent, Latinos
\-- the recession is over. It occurred between 2000 and
2007]{.underline}, as black employment decreased by 2.4 percent and
incomes declined by 2.9 percent. During the seven-year long black
recession, [one third of black children lived in poverty and black
unemployment \--]{.underline} even among college graduates \--
[consistently ran at about twice the level of white
unemployment.]{.underline} That was the black recession. [What\'s
happening now is a depression.]{.underline} Black unemployment is now at
14.7 percent, compared to 8.7 for whites. In New York City, black
unemployment has been rising four times as fast as that of whites.
Lawrence [Mishel]{.underline}, president of the Economic Policy
Institute, [estimates that 40 percent of African Americans will have
experienced unemployment]{.underline} or underemployment [by
2010]{.underline}, and [this will increase child poverty from one-third
of African American children to slightly over half]{.underline}. No one
can entirely explain the extraordinary rate of job loss among African
Americans, though factors may include the relative concentration of
blacks in the hard-hit retail and manufacturing sectors, as well as the
lesser seniority of blacks in better-paying, white collar, positions.
But one thing is certain: [The longstanding racial \"wealth gap\" makes
African Americans particularly vulnerable to poverty when job loss
strikes.]{.underline} In 1998, the net worth of white households on
average was \$100,700 higher than that of African Americans. By 2007,
this gap had increased to \$142,600. The Survey of Consumer Finances,
which is supported by the Federal Reserve Board, collects this data
every three years \-- and every time it has been collected, the racial
wealth gap has widened. To put it another way: [in 2004, for every
dollar of wealth held by the typical white family, the African American
family had only one 12 cents. In 2007, it had exactly a dime. So when an
African American breadwinner loses a job, there are usually no savings
to fall back on, no well-heeled parents to hit up, no retirement
accounts to raid]{.underline}.

However, [no outside force guarantees the continued progress of the
human species, nor does anything mandate that the human species must
even continue to exist]{.underline}. In fact, [history is littered with
races and civilizations that have disappeared without a trace. So, too,
could the human species. There is no guarantee that the human species
will survive]{.underline} even if we posit, as many have, a special
purpose to the species' existence. Therefore, [[the species innately
comprehends that it must engage in]{.mark} purposive [actions]{.mark} in
order [to maintain its level of growth]{.mark} [and progress]{.mark}.
Humanity's future is conditioned by]{.underline} what I call [the
Imperative of Growth]{.underline}, a principle I will herewith describe
along with its several corollaries. The Imperative of Growth states that
[[in order to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}, any nation, indeed[, [the
human race, must grow, both materially and
intellectually]{.underline}]{.mark}[. The Macroindustrial Era represents
growth in the areas of both technology and human development, a natural
stage in the evolution of the species]{.underline}' continued extension
of its control over itself and its environment. Although 5 billion
strong, [[our continued existence depends on our ability to continue the
progress we have been making at higher and higher
level]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Systems, whether organizations,
[societies]{.underline}, or cells, [have three]{.underline} basic
[directions in which to move. They can grow, decline, or temporarily
reside in a state of equilibrium]{.underline}. These are the choices.
[[Choosing any alternative to growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance,
stabilization of production/consumption through zero-growth policies,
[[could have alarmingly]{.mark} pernicious [side effects, including
extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline} **He Continues. .** . The fifth
corollary of the Imperative of Growth claims that [a society can remain
in a state of equilibrium only temporarily]{.underline}. In reality, [a
society seemingly in a phase where it neither improves nor regresses is
actually in a transition to either growth or decline. Such periods
easily seduce their contemporaries into a false sense of security, that
their institutions will last forever]{.underline}, they have all the
science they need, and there are no more challenges. In fact, during
such periods some imagine that they have reached their "golden age,"
perhaps even the "end of history." [During such periods of supposed
equilibrium, the population ceases to prepare itself for new challenges
and becomes risk averse]{.underline}. Importantly, [they reject the idea
that growth and progress are necessary for their survival]{.underline}.
The sixth corollary evolves from the fifth. [[If the system chooses not
to grow, it will decline and eventually disappear]{.mark}, either
because other organisms or systems overtake it or because it is
impossible to maintain itself even at static levels without in some way
deteriorating]{.underline}. This is the Law of Spiraling Regression. It
is indeed a curiosity of the late-twentieth-century culture that this
truism has been ignored. In the morass of claims about the risks of
technological growth and its impact on the ecosystem, the mainstream
media and orthodox [[a]{.mark}cademics have decided not to consider what
harm the full pursuance of zero growth or non growth might inflict on
the sociotechnical system, which includes our technological
infrastructure, culture, and standard of living.]{.underline}

**The worse it is now, the better -- the banking sector needs a
sustained crisis to cut off failing banks - perception of short-term
turnaround only encourages more bubble-inducing speculation**

[[The scale of that bubble is reminiscent of the price-inflation bubble
that bedeviled President Carter. So are the policies being used to deal
with it.]{.mark} [Carter]{.mark}]{.underline} and his hapless Fed
chairman, G. William Miller, [[flooded the economy with dollars]{.mark}
even as consumer price inflation spiraled out of control]{.underline}.
Volcker took over the Fed in 1979 and, by previous standards, moved
aggressively his first year in office. But he made little headway.
Finally, in late 1980, he cracked down hard and significantly raised
interest rates. Unemployment soared from 5.8 percent to 9.7 percent.
Inflation stubbornly held on but finally broke in 1983. For the next
several years, Volcker continued to crack down at the slightest hint of
price buoyancy, until the markets took for granted that the United
States was a low-inflation economy. [The]{.underline} 2008 analogue to
the Volcker [strategy would be to force a harsh, fast marking-down of
all bank assets to real values. A one- to two-year bloodbath is far
preferable to a decade of death by a thousand cuts]{.underline}. [[Many
banks would fail]{.underline}]{.mark} and would have to be re-equitized
by the government --- the terms should be neither punitive nor
excessively generous --- [[but the weakest and the most irresponsible
should]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[be let go]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[The banking system that emerges should be dull]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- one [where credit analysis trumps financial engineering and where
everything is on the balance sheet.]{.underline} [The big [Canadian
banks]{.mark}]{.underline}, RBC and TD Bank, [[have
been]{.mark}]{.underline} determinedly [[dull]{.mark} in the 2000s [and
have turned in superb profits]{.mark}, far [outperforming]{.mark} their
supposedly brilliant [American cousins]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Shrinking
the banking sector will curtail bubble-style lending]{.mark} and force
the share of GDP represented by consumer spending]{.underline} back down
from its current 70 percent [to a more sustainable 65-66
percent]{.underline}. It will be very painful, putting many companies in
jeopardy, but **[[it is the only way to engineer a transition to a world
in which we spend less on houses and TVs and more on infrastructure and
health care]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Interest rates will be higher to
encourage savings and taxes will go up, but **[[debt should go
down]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the bottom half of the population should
be more secure. It will also be very important to shore up our tattered
social safety net to cushion the recession\'s impact on that lower half.

It\'s hard to find anything to smile about [[in the economy these
days]{.underline}]{.mark}. Portfolios are in tatters. Jobs are being
slashed. The market can\'t find a floor. National debt can\'t find a
ceiling. Inflation, oil, home prices ... it\'s not hard to see why the
myriad issues draw comparisons to the Great Depression. Yet [beneath the
ruckus, one statistic \--]{.underline} perhaps [[**the most vital
component of getting back on a sustainable track** \--
is]{.mark}]{.underline} doing better than it has in years. [[People are
saving money again]{.underline}]{.mark}. [And in a big way]{.underline}
The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports [consumers]{.underline}
[saved]{.underline} an annualized \$297 billion in the second quarter
\-- [more than 10 times higher than the first quarter]{.underline}, and
the highest quarterly savings [since 1995]{.underline}. From 2004
through 2007, the average rate was around \$85 billion. In the third
quarter of 2005, things got really out of hand, with a negative savings
rate ... meaning that as a collective body, living paycheck-to-paycheck
meant you were ahead of the pack. Thank goodness those overextended days
are gone. It\'s about time As was the case with oil prices, [[people
don\'t start changing their ways until the problem is shoved down their
throat]{.underline}]{.mark}. It took \$4 gasoline to get people to wake
up, and to get innovation from companies like Sasol (NYSE: SSL) and
electric cars from Toyota (NYSE: TM) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) to
start being taken seriously. [[Necessity is the key to
innovation]{.mark}, the proverb goes]{.underline}. The same goes for
saving. As Lehman Brothers, AIG, and Bear Stearns will tell you, greed
clouded by optimism can be an awesomely overwhelming force. Saving went
out of style because, at the rate things were going, few saw a need to.
Why save when your house went up by 20% every year? That\'s all changed
in the past few months as people are realizing that Visa (NYSE: V),
MasterCard (NYSE: MA), and American Express (NYSE: AXP) will make you
richer in your brokerage account than they will in your wallet. As
reality sets in for millions of Americans blindsided by home
foreclosures and job losses without a safety net to fall back on,
[people are scrambling to rebuild and replenish their personal balance
sheets by saving again]{.underline}. And that problem was yours and
yours only Which brings up another point: Can we really put all of the
blame for our current woes on Wall Street? Of course, the army of
Harvard-stupid Wall Streeters (thanks, Bill) were leading the charge,
orchestrating the disaster we\'re now facing. They screwed up. They
should pay the price. And they are. But the larger picture is that it
wasn\'t just Wall Street gorging on more debt than they could handle and
taking excessive risks. It was nearly everybody. By 2005, over a quarter
of Americans\' income went toward revolving debt payments. Debt was the
lifeblood of the economy, and the chickens have come to roost. I dug up
a few headlines from major newspapers and magazines, all published
between 2001-2006, that might remind us how overextended we were. Here
are a few: \* Saving in 2005 Worst Since 1933 \* Equity Shrivels as
Homeowners Borrow and Buy \* As Personal Savings Fall, a Comeuppance Is
Due \* The Way We Live Now: Home Sweet Debt \* Our Vanishing Savings
Rate \* Overwhelming Majority of Americans Feel Consumers Are Taking on
Too Much Debt So, yeah, maybe it wasn\'t just Wall Street When AIG
(NYSE: AIG) gets in over its head, it\'s a sin, and they\'re a criminal.
When John Q. Citizen gets in over his head, it\'s a tragedy, and he\'s a
victim. That blame game is an irony to this debacle that\'ll likely only
prolong our recovery. But enough pointing fingers. For once, let\'s
focus on the good news: People are saving again! [How does that help the
economy? [Countries]{.mark}, like people or business, [grow wealthier
over time by saving money and investing it wisely]{.mark}. It really is
about as simple as that. True, our economy managed to grow over the past
decade with little or no savings]{.underline}. [How? We borrowed. And
that\'s why it\'s falling apart today]{.underline}. [When an economy
saves money, it has the resources it needs to invest [without borrowing
from someone else]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Chinese and OPEC nations), [and
it creates real wealth]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Domestic savings creates a
pot of money borrowers can turn to for investments in projects [that
eventually create jobs, keep interest rates low, and push the economy
along at a sustainable pace.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}The important
part is that it\'s our savings \-- not savings from foreign nations we
became beholden to over the years to sustain our lavish lifestyles. [The
bottom line is simple: people \-- and economies \-- that work hard and
spend less than they make will grow wealthy. People \-- and economies
\-- that borrow heavily and spend more than they make will grow
poor]{.underline}.

#### **[OPEC is dead makes their impacts non-unique.]{.mark}**

**[Butler 19]{.mark}**(Nick Butler, FT energy commentator and chair of
The Policy Institute at King's College London, "The weakness of Opec+ is
evident", 07/08/2019, https://www.ft.com/nick-butler)//Shreyas\
[The agreement between [the oil cartel Opec]{.mark} and a group of
non-Opec countries led by Russia to maintain the quotas they established
last December for another six to nine months confirms the shift in power
within the market away from the producers.]{.underline} In the short
term, the defensive deal agreed in Vienna is designed to prop up prices
at their current levels. The cartel and its new allies, including
Russia, Kazakhstan and Mexico, will continue to take some 1.2m barrels a
day of potential supply off the market. [But [the immediate market
reaction and]{.mark} the [further fall in prices in the following days
show that the shift in income and wealth away from producers is one that
even an agreement by Opec+ --- led by Russia and Saudi Arabia --- cannot
halt.]{.mark}]{.underline} Last week's formal deal came as no surprise.
Nor was it surprising that the once hugely proud and exclusive club Opec
agreed to create a permanent alliance with the other countries. The need
to cling together was evident to everyone --- although some, including
the Iranians, remain unhappy about the dominance of Russia and Saudi
Arabia in the decision-making process. The exporters are being forced to
adapt by the impact on the oil market of the one major player not
represented in Vienna last week: the US. American shale production ---
up from almost nothing 10 years ago to 8.5m b/d in May with a further
rise predicted over the next five years --- has reshaped the entire
global market. Because of that rise, the loss of production from
Venezuela, Libya and Iran has been shrugged off. In addition, the US has
met most of the gradual increase in global demand seen in the past few
years. [What happens next in a market over which Opec has lost control
depends on the demand side of the equation. The prospect of a serious
trade conflict between the US and Beijing remains, and there are
significant signs of a slowing of China's economy and therefore of its
oil import requirements.]{.underline} Since these are running at around
9.5m b/d, any variation in China's needs swings the physical market and
the surrounding speculation[. The most recent oil market outlook from
the International Energy Agency predicts global demand growth of 1.2m
b/d this year but that figure could be revised downward, as it was last
month.]{.underline} If demand remains soft, with prices pushed down as
Iran tries to beat US sanctions by offering discounts to buyers, the
Opec+ quotas will not go far enough. Saudi Arabia, which has already cut
its production by some 600,000 b/d beyond its agreed curbs, will have to
do even more. It is tough to see which --- if any --- of the other
producers would be willing or able to cut further by any material
amount. The intriguing player in the new pattern of relationships is
Russia, which seems to have finally accepted that it is a petro-economy
whose interests are aligned with those of the Opec states such as
Nigeria and Kuwait. The shift is a sign of President Vladimir Putin's
pragmatism and grasp of the dynamics of the market but also shows
Russia's fundamental economic weakness. Oil and gas account for more
than 60 per cent of its export earnings and around 50 per cent of state
revenues. The diversification of the economy promised when Mr Putin came
to power 20 years ago has never happened. Russia's vulnerability lies in
the fact that, for reasons beyond its control, excess supplies of both
oil and gas are undermining prices and therefore reducing the flows of
revenue through the state companies. The new alliance between Moscow and
Riyadh renews a link established in 1926 when the Soviet Union was the
first foreign power to recognise Abdul Aziz al-Saud, grandfather of the
current king, as the ruler of the Hejaz and Nejd --- the forerunner of
the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Relations have not always been
smooth, particularly when the Saudis were funding the Afghan mujahideen
as they drove out the Soviet army in the 1980s. Today's relationship is
one of necessity, and it will be severely tested if oil prices drop
further. [[Falling prices mean falling revenues, giving]{.mark} every
producer in the new grouping --- including [Russia --- the incentive to
break their quotas and produce a little more.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Last week's deal is fragile and cannot disguise the fundamental shift
of income and wealth away from the oil exporters. **Opec's glory days
are over**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The world's call on the cartel's oil is
down to levels not seen since the early 1980s. Over the past five years,
the market's move from being producer-led to a situation where the risks
to prices, even after they have fallen from \$110 a barrel in the early
months of 2014 to just above \$60 now, are still predominantly on the
downside[. **[This could be from weakening demand or, through political
change, some restoration of production in Venezuela or
Iran.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Short of a war or revolution in the Middle
East taking out substantial supply for a sustained period, Opec+ will
need to at least maintain its quotas far beyond March. As the reaction
of the market to last week's announcement showed, there is deep
scepticism about the ability of the producers to hold together for a
long defensive fight.

[Marx et al 7]{.underline} says climate change must ["**facilitate this
interaction is through group and participatory
decision-making."**]{.underline} **Means the aff must allow the neg to
choose to not do the aff, meaning no perm**

\[mr.ghs\]

For all but the most harried journalist motivated by a need to pay off
the mortgage, the annual G20 summit -- being held this weekend in Buenos
Aires -- is typically viewed as a perfect cure for insomnia. Who will
stand next to whom in the family photo? Will the wording of a final
statement be agreed by all leaders before the official deadline? Yawn
yawn yawn. However, there is an exception to every rule. And yesterday's
opening ceremony proved to be just that. [First, a hot mic picked up
parts [of a tense conversation between the ]{.mark}]{.underline}French
[[President and Saudi Crown Prince]{.underline}]{.mark}. [While hardly a
slanging match, it [was the most undiplomatic spat between a Western and
Saudi leader]{.mark} ever made public.]{.underline} [**That was followed
by the equally unprecedented spectacle of a bro-five between the latter
and Russia's Vladimir Putin.** In the space of an hour, we may have
witnessed what future history books will say was the moment Saudi
Arabia's relations pivoted from the West towards Russia. The
relationship between the democratic West and theocratic Saudi Arabia has
often been described as a marriage of convenience]{.underline}. The
exchange between President Emmanuel Macron and Crown Prince Mohammed
will certainly sound familiar to anyone who has been through a messy but
not especially bitter divorce: MbS: Don't worry. M: I do worry. I am
worried, because I am very exp... MbS: He told me. Thank you. M: I don't
want... MbS: No. M: You never listen to me. MbS: I will listen, of
course. M: ... MbS: It's OK. I can deal with it. **[The official word
from the Elysee Palace is that]{.underline}** the President was giving
the Crown Prince a 'very firm' warning over the murder in Istanbul of
Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and the continuing humanitarian crisis
in Yemen[**.** In the Western media, the two issues have become
inextricably linked. For having failed in their effort to oust the Crown
Prince, there is now as a push -- led by the Washington Post, which has
tripled its coverage of Yemen during the past six weeks -- to bring an
end to the Yemen conflict as retribution for Khashoggi's
slaughter.]{.underline} And this is especially embarassing for Macron.
As recently as April, he pledged France's 'full support' for the Saudi
position on Yemen, while slamming the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels the
Saudis and their allies are battling against. Predictably, this came on
the back of arms agreements worth \$18bn. But Macron's exasperated 'You
never listen to me' may have been in reference to the Saudi ruler's
decision last year to kidnap Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri during
a visit to Riyadh, when he was beaten up and forced to read a
resignation letter on Saudi TV. It was only after Macron stepped in that
Hariri was finally released, and was subsequently able to resume his
role as prime minister. In this way, Macron has been strutting around
the world lecturing other countries and leaders how to behave as, his
critics argue, a way of diverting attention from his own abysmal
failures at home. [Now he is in the unenviable position of being not
only the least popular French president in modern history but also
aligned most closely abroad with a Saudi ruler who is perhaps the most
despised in the world.]{.underline} [**[Putin]{.mark}, of course, [is
watching]{.mark} all this [with relish]{.mark}.** He is experienced in
the art of bumping off political opponents, and having eradicated almost
all traces of meaningful democracy and freedom of expression at home is
able to offer the Crown Prince the hand of friendship without fear of
reprecussions]{.underline}. He laid the groundwork last year during an
official state visit to Moscow by King Salman --- the first ever by a
reigning monarch. They signed a \$3bn arms deal and pledged tens of
billions more in bilateral trade. At the time, Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov described the event as 'an historical moment'. **[Now
[Saudi Arabia is]{.mark} even [negotiating the purchase of
Russia's]{.mark} formiddable S-400 [defense missile system, while
threatening to cancel arms deals with the Western countires]{.mark} and
instead purchase weaponary from Russia and China [if sanctions are
imposed over the Khashoggi affair]{.mark}. As with Syria and Iran, [the
Kremlin is demonstrating]{.mark} how, [in contrast to the fickle West,
it can relied on to remain a steadfast ally]{.mark} to countries in the
Middle East it considers friendly, come hell or high
water.]{.underline}** [The partnership between Saudi Arabia and Russia
is not going to flourish overnight. But [the crucial difference]{.mark}
between our political leaders and theirs is [that the latter
think]{.mark} not in terms of election cycles while feeding at the
trough, but rather [how to forge deep strategic]{.mark}
[partnerships]{.mark} that will bear fruit decades, even centuries, in
the future.]{.underline}

Experiment,\" Lawfare,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/pushing-back-russia-middle-east-thought-experiment>
\[mr.ghs\]

**[[Russia is]{.mark} increasingly [emerging as an enemy of the United
States]{.mark}, not just a rival.]{.underline}** Although President
Trump generally seems to oppose any attempt to confront Russia---with
the exception of a tweet this morning in which he warned the Kremlin to
"get ready"---[it's worth considering how a more strategically minded
administration might do so, [particularly in the Middle East, where
Moscow has vastly expanded its influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. During
the height of the Cold War, the United States reflexively opposed the
Soviet Union and the spread of communism. In addition to shoring up
allies in Europe and Japan, the United States often sought to hinder or
roll back Moscow's influence in parts of Africa and Asia, regardless of
the minor strategic significance of the areas in question. In the Middle
East, the U.S. opposition to the Soviet Union often manifested in
efforts to sway and topple governments in Iraq and Syria and a
competition for influence in Egypt, among other locations. At the Cold
War's end, the Soviet Union maintained some interest in and influence
over Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Syria and South Yemen (the last of which
would soon enter history's dustbin). Yet for the most part, the United
States had run the board, with close partnerships with key states such
as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Morocco, and Egypt as well as Israel and
Turkey, the region's military powerhouses. These close relationships
continued after the Cold War's end, and the United States even improved
relations with several of Moscow's former clients. The dominant U.S.
position in the Middle East slipped under President Obama. Skeptical of
intervention in the Middle East and unsympathetic to long-standing
allies like Saudi Arabia, the Obama administration tried to keep its
distance from the region. [Although the United States intervened in
response to the Islamic State's atrocities against the Yazidis and the
broader concerns about terrorism, the [Obama]{.mark} team still [tried
to avoid greater entanglement in Syria, distanced itself from
Egypt]{.mark} after the 2013 coup, [soured on Netanyahu's]{.mark}
government in Israel and limited efforts to deal with trouble spots like
Libya and Yemen to a narrow counterterrorism mission]{.underline}. Even
the administration's successes, like the Iran deal, seemed to alienate
many traditional American friends[. **[U.S. credibility in the region
fell]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** and many leaders were
glad to see Obama go. **[[Moscow entered into the void]{.mark} [created
by the decline in the U.S. position]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Russia
backed its Syrian ally when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was on the
ropes, helping Assad's government survive and slowly turning the tide
against an opposition that Washington nominally championed. Moscow
delivered for its allies and claimed victory as the Islamic State
receded and the Syrian state recaptured much of its lost, though now
devastated, territory. **[Moscow has]{.mark} also [made inroads with
former U.S. stalwarts]{.mark}**]{.underline}: President Vladimir Putin
recently visited Turkey, probably to coordinate the crushing of the
Syrian Kurds who were the tip of the U.S. spear against the Islamic
State. Russia also offered to sell Turkey advanced weapons. King Salman
of Saudi Arabia, whose country had long scorned Russia, traveled to
Moscow last October to talk about shoring up the price of oil.
Ideologically, Russia also fits in well with the Middle East.
[[Putin,]{.mark} an autocrat himself[, is comfortable with dictators and
resents]{.mark} what he perceives as U[.S. democracy
promotion]{.mark}---a position that dictators in the Middle East also
share.]{.underline} As Steven Cook notes, "Now it's payback time for
almost three decades of Moscow's humiliation. [And [what better place to
start than]{.mark} [the Middle East]{.mark}, where the United States is
already widely resented even among its allies."]{.underline}

[Experts who had argued that authoritarianism [in the Middle
East]{.mark} would maintain stability and keep extremism at bay were
proven wrong by the events of the Arab Spring.\[xxxv\] **The [Russian
leadership]{.mark}, however, [still projects]{.mark} its vision of
"[autocratic stability]{.mark}" onto the region**. And even though
Moscow repeatedly insists that it is up to the Syrian people to decide
through a presidential election who will lead the nation into the
post-war period, **[the Russian government is unlikely to become a
supporter of democracy]{.mark} movements in the Middle East.** After
all, elections have been a crucial legitimization tool of Russia's own
"managed democracy." **[The consolidation of power]{.mark} in the hands
of the national leader [as well as the securitization of the political
agenda]{.mark} have [characterized]{.mark} the Russian political system
throughout the last 17 years Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} has been in power.
And they [continue to guide him in how he sees]{.mark} regimes in [the
Middle East]{.mark}.** Some of these authoritarian Arab regimes share a
long history with Russia: during the Cold War, they proved their ability
to maintain order for longer than any democratic regime could sustain
it, not least due to Moscow's financial and military support.
[The]{.mark} fact that Bashar al-Assad survived throughout the bloody
[Syrian conflict]{.mark}, to a large extent due to Russia's aid,
[solidifies the idea]{.mark} [that authoritarianism in the Middle East
guarantees stability]{.mark} and puts a cap on "toxic" democratic values
imposed from the outside. [In Moscow]{.mark}'s view, [authoritarian
tendencies are indigenous to the region]{.mark}, much like they are to
Russia, which is why they need not be battled but rather be correctly
managed. Russia's idea of "authoritarian stability" in the Middle East
may find a potential supporter in Donald Trump, who notoriously dropped
America's agenda for promoting democracy in the Middle East. **The
distinct security focus of Donald Trump's strategy toward the region has
emboldened his allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and convinced them that
the regional policeman will no longer restrain their geopolitical
ambitions.** The position of both Russia and the United States is, thus,
likely to resonate with many governments in the region that previously
had to put on airs of civil society engagement and liberalization just
to have international political and diplomatic backing. Egypt and Turkey
are the two cases in point: the 2017 Human Rights Watch World Report
specifically points to them to illustrate how the tide of new
authoritarianism is sweeping through the Middle East.\[xxxvi\] In
Turkey, the attempted coup in July 2016 was used by President Recep
Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) as an excuse
to crack down not only on suspected plotters but also on wider circles
critical of the government's policies. **Western powers sharply rebuked
Erdoğan over his suspension of the rule of law in the country and mass
detentions---but Russia pointedly did not. Putin was the one world
leader who gave a call to Erdoğan to tell him Moscow supports his
campaign to root out dissent, which the Turkish president described as
"anti-constitutional**."\[xxxvii\] Furthermore Putin hosted his Turkish
counterpart in St. Petersburg less than a month after the failed coup,
during which Erdoğan explained that Vladimir Putin's call to him was an
important move, "a kind of moral support and display of Russia-Turkey
solidarity," as the Turkish president described the
situation.\[xxxviii\] All this occurred just weeks after Erdoğan's late
June apology to Russia for the November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24
jet over Syria; **and it goes to show how masterfully Vladimir Putin
uses authoritarian movements to his own political benefit.** Egypt is
going through a similar wave of authoritarianism, with President Abdel
Fattah El Sisi cracking down on dissent that is not necessarily
associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. That government campaign is
happening against the backdrop of economic instability, currency
devaluation and increased poverty rates. However, the army's grip on
power and full control over the public sphere give a semblance of
stability in the country. Sisi's fight to eradicate extremism in the
Sinai as well as his crackdown on dissent find support in Moscow, which
is reflected in official statements coming from the Kremlin. Egypt
reemerged as Russia's key partner in the Middle East, including in
crucial spheres of military-technical cooperation. The two countries
signed a protocol on military cooperation in March 2015, significantly
ramped up joint military exercises, and are looking to green light an
agreement that would allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian
airspace and infrastructure.\[xxxix\] With the turmoil and regular
attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, counter-terrorism cooperation has become
a distinct characteristic of the bilateral relationship. A
security-heavy agenda acts as a glue between Moscow and Cairo, not least
due to the military and security background of the political elites of
the two countries. Both Russians and Egyptians will head to the polls in
March 2018 to elect their respective heads of state, while presidential
elections in Turkey are to take place in November 2019. The outcome is
already known in all three countries; Putin, Sisi and Erdoğan will
almost certainly serve out their next terms into the first half of the
2020s, meaning that we are unlikely to witness a disruption in the
security-comes-first policy employed by Moscow in its bilateral
relations with both Cairo and Ankara. **The cases of [Egypt and Turkey
illustrate]{.mark} that Vladimir [Putin is likely to encourage
authoritarian "stability]{.mark}" across the region [through skewed
security-heavy]{.mark} [policies]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} [Putin's
support]{.mark} for autocratic tendencies [will hardly find any
resistan]{.mark}ce among other powers in the region [and will]{.mark}
almost certainly [be embraced.]{.mark} [Syria's recovery]{.mark} from
the seven-year war is unlikely to happen through the emergence of
democratic institutions and freedom, **but [will probably lead to the
creation of a strong regime with an inflated security appara]{.mark}tus
to shield a fragile government [and keep extremist tendencies at
bay]{.mark}**. [Iraq's increasingly sectarian policies hint at a similar
trend]{.mark}. And as Libya's internationally recognized government
fails to establish control over much of the country's territory, [Libyan
National Army]{.mark} Field Marshall Khalifa [Haftar represents the type
of leader the Kremlin would presumably like]{.mark} to see for a
post--civil war Libya. **If Russia's Syria policy is any indication, [a
highly centralized system will be Moscow's remedy for extremism
throughout the wider region]{.mark}**. The fear of a new wave of
extremism will push many regimes to seek more control over the
population, and a lack of incentives to democratize may bring about new
repressive regimes. In other words [Russia's leadership in the Middle
East may significantly lengthen and reinforce]{.mark} the era of
[authoritarianism]{.mark} there.]{.underline}

[The moderate Left misappropriated theoretical terms and concepts,
divorced from any actual theory.]{.underline} Identity politics, despite
its origins in academia, flourishes best on social media --- it's the
most accessible concept for moderate liberals to grasp. "Well, if
identity is only a game, if it is only a procedure to have relations,
social and sexual-pleasure relationships that create new friendships, it
is useful. But [[if identity becomes the problem of]{.mark} sexual
[existence]{.mark}, and if people think that they have to 'uncover'
their 'own identity,' and that [their own identity has to become the
law]{.mark}, the principle, the code of their existence; if [the
perennial question]{.mark} they ask is ['Does this thing conform to my
identity?]{.mark}']{.underline} then, I think, [[they will turn back to
a kind of ethics very close to the old heterosexual
virility.]{.underline}]{.mark} If we are asked to relate to the question
of identity, it must be an identity to our unique selves. But the
relationships we have to have with ourselves are not ones of identity,
rather, they must be relationships of differentiation, of creation, of
innovation. To be the same is really boring. We must not exclude
identity if people find their pleasure through this identity, but we
must not think of this identity as an ethical universal rule." ---
Michel Foucault, "Sex, Power, and the Politics of Identity" (1984)
Identity politics became an albatross, however. Both [[the moderate and
radical were too eager to evangelize oppressed identities. There was no
room for]{.mark} discussion, no place for [debate. **Call outs, clap
backs**]{.mark}, and other reality tv patois [**replaced dialectics**.
Representation is the de facto litmus]{.mark} of society's progress for
the moderate liberal --- [society appeared more inclusive]{.mark} and
diverse [because "Orange is the New Black" has a female lead]{.mark} and
a multiethnic supporting cast. They inhabit a never ending, curated echo
chamber of think pieces, listicles, notifications, and
retweets.]{.underline} Everyone within their algorithmic ghetto shares
their sentiments about society. [The algorithm makes their small corner
seem far more vast than it actually is, and as a result, the moderate
extends this myopia to society at large.]{.underline} The moderate
midwifed the birth of the Alt-Right through bipartisan compromises.
Moderate liberals are basically content to vest trust in their vaunted
Democratic Party as it slides further to the right, thereby underpinning
a level of discourse friendly to the far-right. It's worth remembering
that the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries were a
period of diehard cooperation between liberals and conservatives in
crafting today's authoritarianism. Neoconservatism provided
socio-political planning that complemented a neoliberal economic agenda.
This is why the radical Left blames liberals as well as conservatives
for "command and control policing", mass surveillance and this century's
rationale for endless warfare. [[Moderate liberals]{.mark} provided and
adopted theoretical frameworks that [explained away structural
oppression but retained an appearance of caring about racism]{.mark} and
equality across intersecting spectrums of gender and sexuality. [This

#### Music becomes commodified by the nation-state to promote democracy and capital

[[Despite the recognition of the social importance of
music]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that social structures and developments
can be be reflected in varied ways in musical structures, music has not
been given a fair hearing in the social sciences. If little systematic
investigation into the relation of music to culture or society as a
whole has been made, even less effort has been expended on understanding
the relationship between music and politics. Music has represented a
mode of expression for human beings' interaction with their
surroundings, making it a spontaneous medium for expressing their
discontent with it as well. This discontent has, in varied historical
and geographical contexts, been expressed through words, without words,
through appraisal, evaluation, and often rejection of certain canonical
forms, and through creation of new forms. Further, [[structures of
authority have used music]{.mark} as a medium or mode [for]{.mark}
[transmitting political information]{.mark} and values, [mobilizing the
population, evoking and sustaining pride]{.mark} and identity, [and
legitimizing patterns of authority.]{.mark} Despite there being a long
history of the connection between music and politics, in [the role of
music as a medium]{.mark} or an instrument of political communication,
in critiquing existing social contexts and norms or in expressing
protest against those norms, the corpus of work on music and politics
[has been scant.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is necessary to make a
qualification here. This point, about the corpus of work on music and
politics not being substantial, is being made for politics and protest
as manifest through collective political movements and the music of
protest that arises out of such political mobilizations. [[Political
theory and political philosophy]{.mark} have [engaged]{.mark} with [the
politics of sound]{.mark} and auditory regimes in capitalism, as well as
the politics of the emergence of the "visual" against the "auditory" as
the dominant sensorial register that acquires prominence, and through
[which power gets established and played out in society, particularly
under capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Attali, 1977; Bull & Back, 2003;
Siisiainen, 2012). French theory, through the work of thinkers such as
Ranciere (2006) and Nancy (2007), to name two, has been concerned with
the relationship of music to society, the place of listening with
philosophies and cultures of listening, and the place of the sonorous in
being and experience.

#### Music link - music labels are inherently capitalist, their performance gets consumed by white America in an attempt to become black, the industry is built off of capitalism and the black body becomes just another commoditiy that can be replaced as soon as there is the next big thing or the next black person that they can sell to the world as another piece of media to be consumed, the music industry takes over any potential solvency, their performance becomes coopted by white capitalist society and molded into the white definition of blackness that reproduces their impacts - this independently turns case because black people will always just become the sterotypical thug whose in a gang or smokes weed, their performance is rooted in capitalist exploitation of black bodies to make a profit, white America will consume their performance through the capitalist consumption of everything that is produced in this structure , picking apart the parts of black culture that are aesthetically pleasing and selling it to white America - this turns case and disproves any perm because they are using capitalism to achieve any form of self care which ultimately coopts their movement by directly feeding into capitalism which will inev. Produce anti black violence onto black people. 

#### Performance fails -- it traps resistance at the individual level and cedes the power of surveillance to recognition -- this locks in a universalized, neoliberal subject at the center of their movements -- only anti-capitalist organizing solves

[[The aestheticization of resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} enacted by
anti-surveillance camouflage and fashion [ultimately [fails to
address]{.mark} the exclusionary logics of contemporary state and
[corporate surveillance.]{.mark}]{.underline} These anti-surveillance
practices emerge at this historical juncture because of a widespread
recognition of unchecked, pervasive surveillance and popular criticism
of government and corporate overreach. [The key to the popularity of
[these artistic efforts]{.mark} may be that they [mobilize the trappings
of radical intervention]{.mark}, in highly stylized form, [but do so in
ways that do not compel people to challenge state visuality
projects.]{.mark} [They offer hyper-individualized and consumer-oriented
adaptations to]{.mark} undesired [surveillance.]{.mark}]{.underline} [To
the extent that such efforts can be seen as critical interventions, they
rely on an appeal to the pedagogical potential of art to galvanize
meaningful political change.]{.underline} As Jacques Rancière explains:
Art is presumed to be effective politically because it displays the
marks of domination, or parodies mainstream icons, or even because it
leaves the spaces reserved for it and becomes a social practice. . . .
The logic of mimesis consists in conferring on the artwork the power of
the effects that it is supposed to elicit on the behavior of
spectators.65 In the case of the examples covered in this paper, it is
clear that [while some of the signifiers of critical art are
present]{.underline}, for instance with the Fag Face Mask's blurring of
institutionally imposed identities, [[the primary message is]{.mark}
nonetheless [one of accommodating]{.mark} pervasive
[surveillance]{.mark} and inviting a playful dance with it.]{.underline}
[[Recognition of the violent]{.mark}, unequal, and marginalizing
[applications of surveillance is bracketed]{.mark} or denied [in the
presentation of universal, neoliberal subjects in search of]{.mark} a
modicum of]{.underline} (fashionable) [[control over their
exposure.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is not to say that play has no place
in resistance efforts. As Jeffrey Juris66 has illustrated in his
ethnography of the anti-corporate globalization movement, play and
frivolity can sometimes succeed in ways that oppositional tactics
cannot. For example, in spaces of confrontation, people playing music or
staging performances while dressed in elaborate costumes are effective
because they are symbolically powerful solidarity-building activities
that are not physically threatening to the police. Juris writes, "Such
playful provocation represents a form of ritual opposition, a symbolic
overturning of hierarchy much like medieval carnival.... Play, in
particular, reveals the possibility of radically reorganizing current
social arrangements." 67 In the mode of anti-surveillance, groups like
the Surveillance Camera Players similarly embody a spirit of play as
they stage performances for video surveillance camera operators and
spectators in public places like New York City subway stations.68
Perhaps because of the public setting of these performances, which
usually end with police or security guards escorting players off public
property, these interventions may have the effect of fostering in
audiences a critique of policing priorities and the commodification of
public space. Play of this sort may be an effective form of resistance
that alters public awareness and cultural sensibilities, but it can be a
difficult task for such interventions to problematize inequalities that
can fester within assumptions of shared rights. Ultimately, [discourses
of "the right to hide" are weak variations of "the right to privacy,"
both of which depend on conceptually inadequate and empirically
deficient mobilizations of universal rights.]{.underline} Indeed, [poor
and racialized populations subjected to the most invasive forms of
monitoring are much more concerned with issues of domination and
control, along with the practicalities of survival, than they are with
legal or philosophical abstractions like privacy.]{.underline}69
[Privacy is also a deeply individualistic concept, poorly suited to
forestall discriminatory practices against social groups.]{.underline}70
As Sami Coll explains, "The notion of privacy, as a critique of \[the\]
information society, has been assimilated and reshaped by and in favour
of informational capitalism, notably by being over-individualized
through the self-determination principle." 71 [The discourse of [the
right to hide]{.mark}, as with the right to privacy, [accepts]{.mark}
the legitimacy of [state demands for legible populations and offers
symbolic compromises to assert degrees of freedom within those
constraints.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead of being content with artistic
forms of hiding, [[countervisuality projects]{.mark}, by contrast,
[would]{.mark} "look back" and [pursue alternatives to]{.mark}
totalizing regimes of [state visuality]{.mark}.]{.underline} [They would
seek to undermine the authority of state control [by challenging the
capitalist imperatives that lend legitimacy to]{.mark} forms of [state
violence]{.mark} and oppression.]{.underline}72 [**[What is required is
a full engagement with "the political,"]{.mark}** which,]{.underline} as
Rancière describes, [is always **[in opposition to the
police]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The police is not a social function but a
symbolic constitution of the social. The essence of the police lies
neither in repression nor even in control over the living. Its essence
lies in a certain way of dividing up the sensible. . . . [Politics, by
contrast, consists in transforming this space of "move-along," of
circulation, into a space for the appearance of a subject: the people,
the workers, the citizens.]{.underline}73

**The aff's strategy cedes the universal in favor of local, fragmented
knowledge -- this surrenders the ability to define the future to
neoliberal hegemony -- the universal is not inherently-oppressive, but
it will be under unfettered capitalism**

There has been an excess of modesty in the feminist agendas of recent
decades. Carol A. [Stabile is amongst those who have been critical of an
absence of systemic thinking within postmodern feminisms, remarking upon
[a "growing emphasis on fragmentations and single-issue
politics.]{.mark}"]{.underline}1 [Stabile dismisses this kind of
thinking which, [in]{.mark} "so resolutely [avoiding
'totalizing']{.mark}]{.underline}---the bête noire of contemporary
critical theory---\[...\] [ignores or [jettisons a structural analysis
of capitalism]{.mark}."]{.underline}2 [[The difference in scope]{.mark}
and scale [between that which is being opposed and the strategies being
used to oppose it is generative of]{.mark} a sense of [disempowerment.
]{.mark}]{.underline}On the one hand, Stabile argues, [postmodern social
theorists "accept the systemic nature of capitalism, as made visible in
its consolidation of power and its global expansion]{.underline} \[...\]
[[Capitalism's power]{.mark} as a system [is therefore
identified]{.mark} and named [as a totality]{.mark}"; [on the other
hand, these theorists "celebrate local, fragmented, or partial forms of
knowledge as the only forms]{.mark} of knowledge [available" and
criticize big-picture]{.mark} speculative [thinking for its potentially
oppressive]{.mark} tendencies or [applications.]{.mark}]{.underline}3
Nancy Fraser, too, has addressed this apparent "shrinking of
emancipatory vision at the fin de siècle," linking this with "a major
shift in the feminist imaginary" during the 1980s and 1990s---that is,
with a move away from attempting to remake political economy
(redistribution) and towards an effort at transforming culture
(recognition).4 [The legacies of this kind of political
theorizing]{.underline}---legacies some might describe as "folk
political"---[are still being felt today, and continue to shape the
perceived horizons of possibility for progressive
projects.]{.underline}5 Yet [these projects]{.underline}, which are
frequently valuable, necessary, and effective on their own terms, [are
not sufficient as ends in themselves.]{.underline} To the extent that
they are conceptualized in detachment from an ecology of other
interventions, [operating via a diversity of means and across a variety
of scales, [they cannot serve as a suitable basis for any politics
seeking to contest t]{.mark}he imaginaries of the right or to contend
with [the expansive hegemonic project of neoliberal
capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is for this reason that Nick Srnicek
and Alex Williams's work positions itself as somewhat skeptical about
fragmentations and single-issue politics, pointing out that problems
such as "global exploitation, planetary climate change, rising surplus
populations, \[and\] the repeated crises of capitalism are abstract in
appearance, complex in structure, and non-localized."6 As such, a
[politics based around the ideas that "the local is ethical, simpler is
better, the organic is healthy, permanence is oppressive, and progress
is over" is not always the best weapon in an attempt to contend with the
complex technomaterial conditions of the world as it
stands.]{.underline}7 [[There is a persistent kind of abstraction
anxiety hanging over progressive politics]{.mark}; an anxiety that
haunts a contemporary leftist feminism still unwilling or unable to
critically reappraise the tendencies]{.underline} that Stabile
identified in the 90s. Recently, however, [[a renewed appetite for
ambitious and future-oriented emancipatory politics has begun to make
itself felt]{.mark} at the fringes of the left---and indeed, to gather
momentum and popular support more broadly]{.underline}.8 Perhaps [the
most remarkable example of this tendency within
philosophically-inflected political theory circles has been
[accelerationism,]{.mark} with its [calls to build an "intellectual
infrastructure" capable of "creating a new ideology, economic and social
models,]{.mark} and a vision of the good to replace and surpass the
emaciated ideals that rule our world today."]{.underline}9 These
so-called "Promethean" ideas have generated widespread interest,
arguably both reflecting and contributing to the changing tenor of
activist discourse. Interestingly, this term has to some extent emerged
in opposition to the pejorative "folk political," acting as a shorthand
for a very different set of values and perspectives. In a recent
critical piece, Alexander Galloway suggests that "Prometheanism" could
be defined as "technology for humans to overcome natural limit."10 Peter
[Wolfendale, meanwhile, sees it as a "politics of intervention"---one
that starts from the insistence that [nothing be exempted in advance
from the enactment of re/visionary processes]{.mark}.]{.underline}11

#### We have an ethical-political obligation to reject capitalism -- the [organizing principle]{.underline} of society that necessitates [global exclusion]{.underline} and [violence]{.underline} which [cannot be calculated]{.underline}

**Zizek and Daly 14**

(Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy
at the University of Ljubljana; AND, Glyn, Associate Professor of
Sociology, Economics, International Development, International
Relations, and Politics at the University of Northamption,
"Conversations with Zizek," Republished by Polity Press)

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of
postmodern protocol and recognize that [[our ethico-political
**responsibility** is to **confront**]{.mark} the [**constitutive
violence** of]{.mark} today's **[global capitalism]{.mark}** and its
obscene naturalization / anonymization of the millions who are
subjugated by it throughout the world.]{.underline} Against the
standardized positions of postmodern culture -- with all its pieties
concerning 'multiculturalist' etiquette -- [Zizek is arguing for [a
politics that]{.mark}]{.underline} might be called 'radically incorrect'
in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and
[[focuses]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[on the]{.mark} very
[**organizing principles** of]{.mark} today's **[social
reality]{.mark}**:]{.underline} the principles of global liberal
capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long,
Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism that has
tended towards political morbidity. With the likes of Hilferding and
Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffee, crucial theoretical
advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of
economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem
that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is
to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can
function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of
implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an
ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, the fear of economism can end up
reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary
capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it
fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to
economism. Zizek's point is rather that in rejecting economism we should
not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in shaping the lives and
destinies of humanity and our very sense of the possible. In particular
we should not overlook Marx's central insight that [in order to create a
universal global system the forces of [capitalism seek to **conceal**
the **politico-discursive** **violence** of its construction
through]{.mark} a kind of [gentrification]{.mark} of that
system]{.underline}. What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as
Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that [the gentrification of global
liberal [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} is one whose 'universalism'
fundamentally [[reproduces **and depends** upon a disavowed violence
that excludes **vast sectors** of the world's
populations]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this way, [**[neoliberal
ideology]{.mark}** attempts to [naturalize capitalism by presenting its
outcomes of winning]{.mark} and losing as if they were simply a matter
of chance **[and sound judgment]{.mark}** in a neutral market
place.]{.underline} Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain
diversity, at least for the central capitalist regions, but it is
neither neutral nor ideal and its price in terms of social exclusion is
exorbitant. That is to say, [[the human cost]{.mark} in terms [of
inherent global poverty and degraded 'life]{.mark}-chances' **[cannot be
calculated within the existing]{.mark}** economic [**rationale**
and]{.mark},]{.underline} in consequence, [[social exclusion
remains]{.mark} mystified and [nameless]{.mark}]{.underline} (viz. the
patronizing reference to the 'developing world'). And Zizek's point is
that [this mystification is magnified through capitalism's profound
capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to
redirect]{.underline} (or misdirect) [social antagonisms and to absorb
them within a culture of differential affirmation.]{.underline} Instead
of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political
boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism
and lifestyle. Against this [[Zizek argues for a new]{.mark}
universalism whose [primary **ethical** **directive** is to
**confront**]{.mark} the fact [that our]{.mark} forms of [social
existence are **founded** on **exclusion** on a **global
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While it is perfectly true that
universalism can never become Universal (it will always require a
hegemonic-particular embodiment in order to have any meaning), [what is
novel about Zizek's universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal
this fact or reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a 'glitch'
in an otherwise sound matrix.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is to affirm the model of the Communist Party -- only the Party can provide effective accountability mechanisms to correct chauvinist tendencies, educate and mobilize marginalized communities, and connect local struggles to a movement for international liberation

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [[base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through party organizing]{.mark}, and that [party organizing can allow
this]{.mark} emerging [movement to solidify into a powerful
revolutionary socialist tendency]{.mark} in the United
States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights of the base building
movement is that [the current state of the left in the United States is
one in which revolution is not currently possible.]{.underline} There
exists very little popular support for socialist politics. A century of
anticommunist propaganda has been extremely effective in convincing even
the most oppressed and marginalized that communism has nothing to offer
them. [The base building emphasis on dual power responds directly to
this insight. [By building institutions which can meet people's needs,
we]{.mark} are able to concretely [demonstrate that communists can
offer]{.mark} the oppressed [relief from]{.mark} the horrific conditions
of [capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Base building strategy recognizes
that actually doing the work to serve the people does infinitely more to
create a socialist base of popular support than electing democratic
socialist candidates or holding endless political education classes can
ever hope to do. Dual power is about proving that we have something to
offer the oppressed. The question, of course, remains: once we have
built a base of popular support, what do we do next? [If it turns out
that establishing socialist institutions to meet people's needs does in
fact create sympathy towards the cause of communism, how can we mobilize
that base?]{.underline} Put simply: **[[in order to mobilize the
base]{.mark} which base builders hope to create, [we need to have
already done the work of building a communist
party.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[It is not enough to simply meet
peoples needs. Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power in
the name of communism.]{.underline} [We must refuse covert front
organizing and instead have a public face as a communist
party.]{.underline} When we build tenants unions, serve the people
programs, and other dual power projects, we must make it clear that we
are organizing as communists, unified around a party, and are not
content simply with establishing endless dual power organizations. [We
must be clear that our strategy is revolutionary and in order to make
this clear we must adopt party organizing. By "party organizing" I mean
an organizational strategy which adopts the party model. Such organizing
focuses on building a party whose [membership is formally unified around
a party line determined by democratic centralist decision
making.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The party model creates internal methods
[for **holding party members accountable**, unifying]{.mark} party
member [action]{.mark} around democratically determined goals, [and for
educating]{.mark} party members in communist theory and
praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization utilizing the party model
works to build dual power institutions while simultaneously educating
the communities they hope to serve. [Organizations which adopt the party
model focus on propagandizing around the need for revolutionary
socialism. [They]{.mark} function as the forefront of political
organizing, [empower]{.mark}ing local [communities]{.mark} to theorize
their liberation through communist theory [while organizing communities
to]{.mark} literally [fight for their liberation.]{.mark}]{.underline} A
party is not simply a group of individuals doing work together, but is a
formal organization unified in its fight against capitalism. Party
organizing has much to offer the base building movement. By working in a
unified party, base builders can ensure that local struggles are tied to
and informed by a unified national and international strategy. While the
most horrific manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique
form at the local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is
against a material base which functions not only at the national but at
the international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[[party organizing allows
for]{.mark} local organizations and individual [organizers to be held
accountable]{.mark} for their actions.]{.underline}** [[It allows
criticism to function]{.mark} not as one independent group criticizing
another independent group, but rather as comrades [with]{.mark} a formal
organizational [unity working together to sharpen]{.mark} each others
[strategies and to help correct **chauvinist** ideas and]{.mark}
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [[**accountability is
crucial**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [As a movement which operates within a
settler colonial society, [imperialist and colonial ideal frequently
infect leftist organizing. Creating formal]{.mark} unity and party
[procedure]{.mark} for dealing with and correcting these ideas [allows
us to address these consistent problems]{.mark} within American
socialist organizing.]{.underline} Having a formal party which unifies
the various dual power projects being undertaken at the local level also
allows for base builders to not simply meet peoples needs, but to pull
them into the membership of the party as organizers themselves. The
party model creates a means for sustained growth to occur by unifying
organizers in a manner that allows for skills, strategies, and ideas to
be shared with newer organizers. It also allows community members who
have been served by dual power projects to take an active role in
organizing by becoming party members and participating in the continued
growth of base building strategy. It ensures that there are formal
processes for educating communities in communist theory and praxis, and
also enables them to act and organize in accordance with their own local
conditions. We also must recognize that the current state of the base
building movement precludes the possibility of such a national unified
party in the present moment. Since base building strategy is being
undertaken in a number of already established organizations, it is not
likely that base builders would abandon these organizations in favor of
founding a unified party. Additionally, it would not be strategic to
immediately undertake such complete unification because it would mean
abandoning the organizational contexts in which concrete gains are
already being made and in which growth is currently occurring. What is
important for base builders to focus on in the current moment is
building dual power on a local level alongside building a national
movement. This means aspiring towards the possibility of a unified
party, while pursuing continued local growth. The movement within the
Marxist Center network towards some form of unification is positive step
in the right direction. The independent party emphasis within the
Refoundation caucus should also be recognized as a positive approach. It
is important for base builders to continue to explore the possibility of
unification, and to maintain unification through a party model as a long
term goal. In the meantime, [individual base building [organizations
ought to adopt party models]{.mark} for their local organizing. Local
organizations ought to be building dual power [alongside
recruitment]{.mark} into their organizations, [education]{.mark} of
community members [in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment
of]{.mark} armed and [militant party cadres capable of defending]{.mark}
dual power [institutions from state terror.]{.mark}]{.underline} Dual
power institutions must be unified openly and transparently around these
organizations in order for them to operate as more than "red charities."
Serving the people means meeting their material needs while also
educating and propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and
organizing. [[**The party model** remains the most useful method for
achieving these ends.]{.mark}]{.underline} The use of the party model by
local organizations allows base builders to gain popular support, and
most importantly, to mobilize their base of popular support towards
revolutionary ends, not simply towards the construction of a parallel
economy which exists as an end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we
will see future unification of the various local base building
organizations into a national party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we
must push for party organizing at the local level. If local
organizations adopt party organizing, [it ought to become clear
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[a unified national party will]{.mark}
have to [be the long term goal]{.mark} of the base building
movement.]{.underline}** Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The
long term details of base building and dual power organizing will arise
organically in response to the conditions the movement finds itself
operating within. [I hope that I have put forward a useful contribution
to the discussion about base building organizing, and have demonstrated
the need for party organizing in order to ensure that the base building
tendency maintains a revolutionary orientation.]{.underline} The finer
details of revolutionary strategy will be worked out over time and are
not a good subject for public discussion. I strongly believe party
organizing offers the best path for ensuring that such strategy will
succeed. My goal here is not to dictate the only possible path forward
but to open a conversation about how the base building movement will
organize as it transitions from a loose network of individual
organizations into a unified socialist tendency. These discussions and
debates will be crucial to ensuring that this rapidly growing movement
can succeed.

The evidence is clear. [Donald [Trump']{.mark}s presidency [has eroded
America's soft power]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Only 30% of people recently
polled by Gallup in 134 countries held a favourable view of the United
States under Trump's leadership, a drop of almost 20 points since Barack
Obama's presidency.]{.underline} The Pew Research Center found that
China, with 30% approval ratings, had reached near-parity with the US.
And a British index, The Soft Power 30, showed America slipping from
first place in 2016 to third place last year. Trump's defenders reply
that soft power does not matter. Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney,
proclaimed a 'hard power budget' as he slashed funds for the State
Department and the US Agency for International Development by 30%. For
promoters of 'America First', what the rest of the world thinks ranks
second. Are they right? Soft power rests on attraction rather than
coercion or payment. It co-opts people rather than coerces them. At the
personal level, wise parents know that their power will be greater and
will last longer if they model sound ethical values for their children,
rather than relying only on spankings, allowances or taking away the car
keys. [Similarly, political leaders have long understood the power that
comes from being able to set the agenda and determine the framework of a
debate. If I can get you to want to do what I want, then I do not have
to force you to do what you do not want. If the US represents values
that others want to follow, it can economise on sticks and carrots.
Added to hard power, attraction can be a force multiplier. A country's
[soft power comes]{.mark} primarily [from]{.mark} three sources: its
[culture]{.mark} (when it is attractive to others), [its political
values]{.mark} such as democracy and human rights (when it lives up to
them[), and its policies]{.mark} (when they are seen as legitimate
because they are framed with some humility and awareness of others'
interests).]{.underline} How a government behaves at home (for example,
protecting a free press), [in international institutions (consulting
others and multilateralism) and in foreign policy (promoting development
and human rights) can affect others by the influence of its example. In
all of these areas, [Trump has reversed attractive]{.mark} American
[policies.]{.mark}]{.underline} Fortunately, America is more than either
Trump or the government. Unlike hard-power assets (such as armed
forces), many soft-power resources are separate from the government and
are only partly responsive to its purposes. In a liberal society,
government cannot control the culture. Indeed, the absence of official
cultural policies can itself be a source of attraction. Hollywood movies
like The Post, which showcase independent women and press freedom, can
attract others. So, too, can the charitable work of US foundations or
the benefits of freedom of inquiry at American universities. It is true
that firms, universities, foundations, churches and other
non-governmental groups develop soft power of their own which may
reinforce or be at odds with official foreign policy goals. And all of
these private sources of soft power are likely to become increasingly
important in the global information age. [That is all the more reason
for governments to make sure that their own actions and policies create
and reinforce rather than undercut and squander their soft power.
Domestic or foreign [policies that appear hypocritical, arrogant,
indifferent to others]{.mark}' views, [or based on a narrow conception
of national interests]{.mark} can [undermine soft
power.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, the steep decline in the
attractiveness of the US in opinion polls conducted after the invasion
of Iraq in 2003 was a reaction to the Bush administration and its
policies, rather than to the US generally. The Iraq War was not the
first government policy that made the US unpopular. In the 1970s, many
people around the world objected to the US war in Vietnam, and America's
global standing reflected the unpopularity of that policy. When the
policy changed and the memories of the war receded, the US recovered
much of its lost soft power. Similarly, in the aftermath of the Iraq
War, the US managed to recover much of its soft power in most regions of
the world (though less so in the Middle East). Skeptics might still
argue that the rise and fall of American soft power does not matter
much, because countries cooperate out of self-interest. But this
argument misses a crucial point: cooperation is a matter of degree, and
the degree is affected by attraction or repulsion. Moreover, the effects
of a country's soft power extend to non-state actors---for example, by
aiding or impeding recruitment by terrorist organisations. In an
information age, success depends not only on whose army wins, but also
on whose story wins. [[One]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[greatest]{.mark} [sources]{.mark} [of]{.mark} America's [soft]{.mark}
[power]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [the]{.mark} openness of its
[democratic]{.mark} [processes]{.mark}. [Even]{.mark} [when]{.mark}
mistaken [policies]{.mark} [reduce]{.mark} [its]{.mark}
[attractiveness]{.mark}, [America's]{.mark} [ability]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[criticise]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [correct]{.mark} its mistakes
[makes]{.mark} [it]{.mark} [attractive]{.mark} to others at a deeper
level. When protesters overseas were marching against the Vietnam War,
they often sang 'We Shall Overcome', the anthem of the US civil rights
movement. America, too, will almost certainly overcome. Given past
experience, there is every reason to hope that the US will recover its
soft power after Trump.]{.underline}

"Soft Power": How to Dominate Without the Use of Force or Coercion

Foreign Affairs magazine, published by big-business-funded US policy
think tank, the Council on Foreign Relations, would reveal in a review
of Joseph Nye's book, "Soft Power: The Means to Success in World
Politics," that (my emphasis): ...the term "soft power" --- the ability
of a country to persuade others to do what it wants without force or
coercion --- is now widely invoked in foreign policy debates. [[The
United States]{.mark} can dominate others, but it [has also excelled
in]{.mark} projecting [soft power]{.mark}, with the help of its
companies, foundations, universities, churches, and other institutions
of civil society; [U.S. culture, ideals, and values have been]{.mark}
extraordinarily [important in helping Washington]{.mark} attract
partners and supporters. And [in reality, US domination and its soft
power work]{.mark} together [to create]{.mark} what is modern day
[empire and the foundation of US global hegemony. The]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates']{.underline} many organisations, from
the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) to its Young Leaders
Initiatives targeting the Americas (Young Leaders of the Americas
Initiative/YLAI), Africa (Young African Leaders Initiative/YALI)
and Southeast Asia (Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative/YSELAI),
all [[seek to indoctrinate and co-opt]{.mark} the [populations]{.mark}
of targeted nations [to serve the interests of Wall Street and
Washington]{.mark} rather than their own. While the US does this often
under the guise of promoting "democracy," it is clearly engaged in
precisely the opposite. While democracy is generally understood as a
process of self-determination, through US soft power, the process is
co-opted and abused to allow Wall Street and Washington to determine the
policies and direction a targeted nation takes rather than its own
people. Often times victims of US soft power are youths who are
indoctrinated in university programmes or targeted by US-funded fronts
posing as nongovernmental organisations (NGOs). They believe they have
arrived at their conclusions and adopted their personal set of
principles on their own, unaware of the amount of time, money and energy
invested in ensuring they adopt a worldview and a set of political
proclivities that serve US interests rather than those of their own
nation, people and those of the individuals themselves.]{.underline} The
use of soft power is not new. It is a practice as old as empire itself.
The ancient Romans engaged in sophisticated cultural colonisation we
could easily describe as soft power. Ancient Roman historian Tacitus (c.
AD 56 -- after 117) would adeptly describe the systematic manner in
which Rome pacified foreign peoples and the manner in which it would
extend its sociocultural and institutional influence over conquered
lands. In chapter 21 of his book Agricola, named so after his
father-in-law whose methods of conquest were the subject of the text,
Tacitus would explain (my emphasis): His object was to accustom them to
a life of peace and quiet by the provision of amenities. He therefore
gave official assistance to the building of temples, public squares and
good houses. He educated the sons of the chiefs in the liberal arts, and
expressed a preference for British ability as compared to the trained
skills of the Gauls. The result was that instead of loathing the Latin
language they became eager to speak it effectively. In the same way, our
national dress came into favour and the toga was everywhere to be seen.
And so the population was gradually led into the demoralizing temptation
of arcades, baths and sumptuous banquets. The unsuspecting Britons spoke
of such novelties as 'civilization', when in fact they were only a
feature of their enslavement. In a very similar manner, youths today in
nations targeted by US soft power describe the notions of "democracy"
and "human rights' as well as Western-style neo-liberal politics and
institutions as "civilisation." They often seek out every opportunity to
disparage the culture and institutions of their own nation, describing
them as backwards and demanding they be promptly replaced with new
notions and institutions modelled after or directly beholden to those in
the US and Europe. Thailand's "Color Revolution": US Meddles Abroad,
Accuses Others of Meddling at Home. We can see across the whole of Asia
this full process of soft power coming to fruition. Years and millions
of dollars spent in infiltrating universities, indoctrinating youths
through programmes like YSEALI or the British Chevening scholarships and
funding and directing fronts posing as NGOs has led to the creation of
entire political parties contesting power, comprised of indoctrinated
youths beholden both to the notions of Western culture and institutions
as well as the money and technical support nations like the US and UK
directly provide these parties. Hong Kong's "Demosisto" political
party is made up entirely of youths and NGO representatives that have
been created and funded for years by the US, UK and various other
European interests. Myanmar's ruling National League for Democracy has
the top echelons of its party run by former journalists, activists and
politicians cultivated, funded and trained by US-funded programmes for
decades. This includes the current minister of information, Pe Myint.
Case Study: Thailand The recently formed "Future Forward" opposition
party headed by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit,the heir of a
multi-million dollar auto-parts business, has overtly advertised itself
as an amalgamation of Western-style neo-liberal political ideology.
While the supposed "founders" of the party appear to fully represent
various social issues, the immense amount of money needed to perform
"Future Forward's" campaigning indicates the true founders (and
financial sponsors) have chosen to remain behind the scenes. Reuters in
its article, "Thai auto heir launches new party, promises to heal
political rift," would admit: Thanathorn introduced other party
co-founders on Thursday, including a filmmaker and a number of activists
involved in LGBT and environment causes, among other issues. Party
co-founder Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, a law lecturer at Bangkok's Thammasat
University, said the party hopes to transcend Thailand's political
divide, a sentiment echoed by the student-led groups that have held
anti-junta protests across Bangkok in recent weeks.  But some say the
party might find it difficult to appeal to grassroots voters. "Will
they, academics and NGOs ... be able to connect with grassroots people,
which is a large part of the electoral base?," asked one Twitter user.
To create that electoral base, the US is currently funding programmes
inside Thailand specifically to infiltrate and co-opt local, regional
and national concerns. Everything from environmental issues regarding
the building of dams and power plants to women's rights and access to
education have been used as vectors by US-funded organisations seeking
to co-opt and knit together various genuine individual pragmatic causes
into a singular, national political clearinghouse. Part of this singular
front's responsibilities will be to serve as a voting bloc to place
parties like "Future Forward" into power. NED and YSEALI are two
examples of how single US organisations are targeting and cultivating
youths much in the way Tacitus described in Agricola. These individuals
are cultivated to be "leaders" who then create their own organisations
(often US funded) to begin recruiting and indoctrinating additional
members. Like a pyramid scheme, the efforts' structure enables the US to
recruit and indoctrinate Thais faster than any single US organisation
could do on its own. While programmes like YSEALI boast of thousands of
leaders who undoubtedly have infected thousands more with US-funded
indoctrination, its still isn't likely enough to create a voting bloc
big enough to place "Future Forward" into power. But it doesn't need to
be. The US is still depending on existing political machines of
politicians like US proxy Thaksin Shinawatra to create the support
needed to propel "Future Forward" and other parties like it politically.
Future Forward: The Evolution of a US Proxy   While Reuters admits that
Future Forward has been accused of ties to US proxy Thaksin Shinawatra,
the article fails to mention the substantial evidence those making the
accusations are citing. Piyabutr, mentioned by Reuters as the party's
co-founder, had previously abused his academic credentials to organise
and host an indoor event for Thaksin Shinawatra's United Front for
Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) also known as red shirts. The event
held at Thammasat University, included Thaksin Shinawatra's lobbyist
Robert Amsterdam given a front row seat during the proceedings. The red
shirts are Shinawatra's street front whose reputation had become a
political liability after back-to-back riots and deadly armed violence
the front carried out in 2009-2010. Piyabutr and fellow academics
endeavoured to rehabilitate the UDD's public image by transforming it
into a more academic movement, papering over the crass populism and
demagoguery used to create it in the first place. While the "red shirt"
street front is still used to give emerging successors to Shinawatra's
political machinery the numbers they need at public events, protests and
rallies, this new, more academic face is what is being presented to the
public, and the world. Soft Power's Final Destination: Consume All,
Including Allies   The US will continue attempting to create a voting
bloc independent of traditional political figures like Thaksin
Shinawatra and his own networks of patronage. While Thaksin Shinawatra
has been a loyal servant of US interests for years, the US would prefer
a political party and a voting bloc it controls entirely on its own. By
Shinawatra supporting the creation of parties like "Future Forward" he
is in reality sealing his own political fate. Special interests
sponsoring "Future Forward's" political activities are also creating a
monster that will eventually consume them both politically and
economically in the future. [As demonstrated in [nations]{.mark} around
the world [subjected]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the full cycle of [US meddling,
co-opting, infiltration and domination]{.mark}, even those special
interests that eagerly assisted US ambitions [find themselves unwelcomed
competitors once the US]{.mark} finally [succeeds.]{.mark} [Those who
believe they can "ride the tiger" of US heg]{.mark}emony [into]{.mark}
[power]{.mark} often [find themselves the target of the]{.mark} very
domestic [networks]{.mark} of agitators and activists [they helped the
US create.]{.mark} Protecting Against US Soft Power  Clearly, [the soft
power process]{.mark} has nothing to do with any genuine interpretation
of democracy. It [is simply using democratic]{.mark} [themes]{.mark} and
procedures [to lend legitimacy to]{.mark} what is modern day
[imperialism]{.mark} and the very sort of soft power employed by the
Romans against the ancient world centuries ago. Thailand and other
nations targeted by US soft power can only defend themselves by being
able to both effectively expose US soft power methods, and by countering
them through the work of indigenous institutions and genuine NGOs
filling Thailand's political, activist, educational, information and
economic space sufficiently enough so that no room remains for
foreign-funded alternatives. As to why the US is so interested in
co-opting and controlling Thailand politically, the answer lies in
Washington's larger Asia-Pacific agenda which includes the encirclement
and containment of China with nations that do business with and are
entirely under the influence of Washington. A political party run by the
products of decades of US cultural colonisation and soft power efforts
taking office in Thailand would directly serve Washington's wider
regional ambitions and augment its efforts to co-opt and control
Thailand's Southeast Asian neighbours as well.]{.underline}

#### Black arguments cannot be debated without the experience of pain and suffering of black people. The aff is a appropriation of black culture in order to win the debate, re-entrenching whiteness due to the benefits of black suffering.

**WILDERSON IN 10** \[Frank B., Associate Professor of African American
Studies and Drama at the University of California & former member of the
Umkhonto we Sizwe, Red, White and Black: Cinema and the Structure of US
Antagonisms, p. 10, C.A.\]

**[Again, [if accumulation and fungibility are the modalities through
which Blackness is positioned as incapacity,]{.mark} then genocide is
that modality through which embodied Redness is positioned as
incapacity. [Ontological incapacity,]{.mark}]{.underline}** I have
inferred and here state forthright, **[[is *the* constituent element of
ethics]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Put another way, **[[one cannot embody
capacity and be, simultaneously, ethical. *Where there are Slaves it is
unethical to be free*]{.mark}*.*]{.underline}** The Settler/Master's
capacity, I have argued, is a function of exploitation and alienation,
and the Slave's incapacity is elaborated by accumulation and
fungibility. But the "Savage" is positioned, structurally, by subjective
capacity and objective incapacity, by sovereignty and genocide,
respectively. The Indian's liminal status in political economy, how her
and his position shuttles between the incapacity of a genocided object
and the capacity of a sovereign subject, coupled with the fact that
Redness does not overdetermine the thanatology of libidinal economy
(this liminal capacity within political economy and complete freedom
from incapacity within libidinal economy) raises serious doubts about
the status of "Savage" ethicality vis-à-vis the triangulated structure
(Red, White, and Black) of antagonisms. Clearly, **[[the coherence of
Whiteness]{.mark} as a structural position in modernity [depends on the
capacity to be free from genocide, perhaps not as a historical
experience, but at least as a positioning
modality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This embodied capacity (genocidal
immunity) of Whiteness jettisons the White/Red relation from that of a
conflict and marks it as an antagonism: it stains it with
irreconcilability. Here, the Indian comes into being and is positioned
by an a priori violence of genocide. Whiteness can also experience this
kind of violence but only *a fortiori*: genocide may be one of a
thousand contingent experiences of Whiteness but it is not a constituent
element, it does not make Whites white (or Humans human). **[Whiteness
can grasp its own capacity, be present to itself, coherent, by its
unavailability to the a priori violence of Red genocide, as well as by
its unavailability to the a priori violence of Black accumulation and
fungibility. [If it experiences accumulation and fungibility, or
genocide, those experiences must be named]{.mark},]{.underline}**
qualified, that is, "White slavery," or the Armenian massacre, the
Jewish Holocaust, Bosnian interment, **[[so that such contingent
experience is not confused with ontological
necessity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In such a position one can always say,
"Im not a 'Savage'" or "I'm being treated like a nigger." One can assert
one's Humanity by refusing the ruse of analogy. Regardless of Whites'
historical, and brief, encounters with the modalities of the "Savage"
and the Slave, these modalities do not break in on the position of
Whiteness with such a force as to replace exploitation and alienation as
the Settler/Master's constituent elements. **[We might [think of
exploitation and alienation as modalities of suffering which inoculate
Whiteness from death]{.mark}. If this is indeed the case, then perhaps
[Whiteness has no constituent elements other than the immanent status of
immunity.]{.mark} Still, [this immunity]{.mark} is no small matter, for
it [is the sine qua non of Human capacity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### 3. Pragmatism-Their desire to seek a perfect conceptual understanding of power before reengaging the political makes the good the enemy of the perfect, we can't afford to wait.

**Yancy 1** (George Yancy and Cornel West, \"Cornel West\", p 70) \*we
do not endorse ableist language

[The final component of the political construal of prophetic pragmatism
deals with the issue of power. Here, West announces that [prophetic
pragmatism will unmask the different power structures that present
themselves as natural.]{.mark}]{.underline} Along with this, he Ervors a
genealogical strategy that will similarly unearth the relevant practices
and systems of beliefs inappropriately dependent upon questionable moral
values. Confessing to his Foucauldian connections, he states that
"Prophetic pragmatism shares with Foucault a preoccupation with the
operation of powers. It also incorporates the genealogical mode of
inquiry \.... \[Plrophetic pragmatism promotes genealogical materialist
modes of analysis similar in many respects to those of Foucault.["3\"
West finally [construes prophetic pragmatism as]{.mark} a form of
[tragic thought.]{.mark} although not a "doomsday" form of thinking. To
the extent that [prophetic pragmatism evades involvement with a priori
epistemological concerns but instead focuses on the everyday
concerns]{.mark} of human beings, [West cautions that.]{.mark} despite
our efforts to better our existential condition, [both personal and
social evil are persistent realities not immediately submissive to our
intentions to do good.]{.mark} Evil's evasion of the good that we seek
to do will continue. West\'s focus on the presence of evil is not an
invitation to concede defeat but rather one to force us to become humble
as we realize that our best intentions are not immune to failure.
[Prophetic pragmatism]{.mark}. according to West, ["is a form of trage
thought]{.mark} in that it conlionts candidly individual and collective
experiences of evil in individuals and institutions - [with little
expectation of ridding the world of all evil."]{.mark}3\']{.underline}
As with his other construals. West links his conception of prophetic
pragmatism, as a fomi of tragic thought, with democracy. What he seems
to be getting at here is the idea that it is misleading to assume that
we can totally and completely realize the absolute ideal of democracy as
a historically manifested reality[. [Democracy remains an ideal that we
must constantly pursue while realizing that we are not pursuing an
illusion.]{.mark} The dynamics of human existence and the dialectical
tensions between human being and the natural world continually give rise
to various obstacles and challenges as we seek a more socially enriching
existence. Nevertheless, in acknowledging the constant struggle to
improve things, [West warns against surrendering to pessimism or
yielding to the]{.mark} seductive [idea of perfectibility.]{.mark}
Hence, he maintains: Prophetic pragmatism denies Sisyphean pessimism and
utopian perfectionism. Rather. it promotes the possibility of human
progress and human impossibility of paradise. [Human struggles its at
the center of prophetic pragmatism, a struggle guided by a democratic
and libertarian vision, sustained by]{.mark} moral [courage and]{.mark}
existential [integrity, and tempered by the recognition of]{.mark} human
[finitude and fragility."]{.mark}]{.underline} Clearly. West focuses
persistently upon the importance of creating "new possibilities for
human agency." He even briefly describes his prophetic pragmatism as a
form of historical consciousness attuned to the struggles of the past as
well as appreciative of the alternative forms of life based upon the
best of the past. [But he quickly interjects the theme of the tragic,
stating that the praxis of [prophetic pragmatism "is tragic action with
revolutionary intent.\"]{.mark}33 Finally, forever straddling two modes
of thought at once, West reiterates [that prophetic pragmatism is not
blind to the fact that utopian schemes]{.mark} QIIIJOK [escape the
limitation presented by the unfortunate condition of
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} and the structures of injustice
normally sustained by social, economic and political institutions. So,
even if prophetic pragmatism evades pessimism, it still cautiously
embraces utopianism. According to West: Prophetic pragmatism. . .
tempets its utopian impulse with a profound sense of the tragic
character of life and history. This sense of the tragic highlightst be
irreducible predicament of unique individuals who undergo dread,
despair, disillusionment, disease, and death and institutional forms of
oppression that dehumanize people." Now that we have some understanding
of \\Vest\'s impressionistic conception of prophetic pragmatism. we can
offer an evaluation of it. We should keep in mind, however, that thus
task is complicated by West\'s preference for a method of reading that
emphasizes moving the reader through passionate and motivational
rhetoric rather than the reader through the dispassionate execution of
arguments. Hence, in criticizing West, we must focus on the vision at
the heart of his prophetic pragmatism and not treat it as a systematic
body of truths.

#### 1. You fail to ground your discourse in materiality -- you don't defend anything and understand the impacts of your inaction -- vote neg on presumption 

Rashad **Evans** writes while debating Casey Harrigan in 20**12**:
Rashad Evans, 2012 11-20-2012 (http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/)

[A quare approach to debate includes afro-pessimism. For instance, I am
pessimistic that any of the solutions being floated around will
meaningfully address anti-blackness. I am pessimistic of changes in MPJ,
resolutional wording or tournament practices to address the attitudinal
and structural (throwback) barriers to black participation in debate. A
quare approach to debate recognizes the importance that color, sex and
gender have in structuring our lives and producing differing results for
different people[. Disidentification is a way by which we can enact
change at the structural level through localized acts of
resistance]{.mark}. It is a process whereby we can work on and against
the system.]{.underline} I started this process at Harvard with the
initiation of my affirmative action policy and have continued on
facebook and my blog. **[[This disidentification is important because it
recognizes the material consequences of our actions and inactions. It
also allows individuals utilize discourse in a subversive
way]{.underline}]{.mark}**. E. Patrick Johnson explains that: "Foucault
himself acknowledges that discourse has the potential to disrupt power:
"Discourses are not once and for all subservient to power or raised up
against it, anymore than silences are. We must make allowances for
complex and unstable process whereby discourse can be both an instrument
and effect of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling block, a point of
resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Discourse
transmit and produces power; it reinforces it , but also undermines and
exposes it, renders it fragile and makes it possible to thwart it.
Although people of color, myself included, may not have theorized our
lives in Foucault's terms, we have used discourse in subversive ways
because it was necessary for our survival. Failure to ground discourse
in materiality is to privilege the position of those whose subjectivity
and agency, outside the realm of gender and sexuality, have never been
subjugated." Therefore, [[we must look look at the material consequences
of our acts]{.mark} and inactions and account for the ways in which
certain performances either maintain power or subvert
power.]{.underline} In addition, [we must account for stylistic
differences]{.underline}. It is at the level of style that most black
and queer politics are enacted. [In]{.underline} the
[debate]{.underline} space[, stylistic differences is one of the most
important ways that Black debaters enact their politics and resistance.
Style is an important tool of survival]{.underline} for Black, queer and
female debaters. [One cannot speak if she cannot speak with and from her
own voice]{.underline}. Style is important and so too is the value of
using the debate space to theorize about life more generally. Debate is
a homeplace for its participants. [[Theorizing about things like
anti-blackness, humanism and feminism from within the debate space is
important to teaching debaters how to theorize about this issues outside
the debate space]{.mark}.]{.underline} We must always be able to be
critical in those places where we are most familiar and most

[We see then that [power has a dual character]{.mark} and that [we
cannot]{.mark} simply [identify and define phenomena without acting, for
to do so is to become an armchair philosopher.]{.mark} And when Bobby
and I left Merritt College to organize brothers on the block we did so
because the college students were too content to sit around and analyze
without acting. On the other hand, [power includes action]{.mark}, for
it is making phenomena perform in the desired manner. [But action
without thinking and theory is also incorrect. If the social
forces]{.mark} at work in the community [have not been correctly
analyzed and defined, how can you control them]{.mark} in such a way
that they act in a desired manner? So the Black Panther Party has always
merged theory and practice in such a way as to serve the true interests
of the community. [In merging theory with practice we recognized that it
was necessary to develop a theory which was valid for more than one time
and place.]{.mark} We wanted to develop a system of which was good
anywhere, thus it had to be rather abstract. [Yet our theory would
relate to a concrete analysis]{.mark} of concrete conditions [so that
our actions would always be relevant]{.mark} and profitable to the
people. Yet, at the same time, [it had to advance their thinking so that
they would move toward a transformation]{.mark} of their situation of
exploitation and oppression. We have always insisted on good theory and
good practice, but we have not always been successful in carrying this
through. [When the Black Panther Party defected]{.mark} from the Black
community; [we became,]{.mark} for a while, [revolutionary cultists.
One]{.mark} of the primary [characteristic]{.mark}s [of a revolutionary
cultist is that ]{.mark}]{.underline}~~he~~ \[[[they\]]{.mark}
[despise]{.mark}s [everyone who has not reached
]{.mark}]{.underline}~~his~~ [[\[their\] level of consciousness,]{.mark}
or the level of consciousness that he \[they\] thinks ~~he has~~ \[they
have\] reached, instead of acting to bring the people to that level. In
that way the revolutionary cultist becomes divided from the
people,]{.underline} ~~he~~ [\[they\] defects from the community.
Instead of serving the people as a vanguard[,]{.mark}]{.underline}
~~he~~ [[\[they\] become]{.mark}s [a hero.]{.mark} Heroes engage in very
courageous actions sometimes, and they often make great sacrifices,
including the supreme sacrifice, but they are still isolated from the
people. [Their courageous actions and sacrifices do not lead]{.mark} the
people [to a higher level of consciousness, nor]{.mark} do they produce
[fundamental changes]{.mark} in the exploitation and oppression of the
people. [A vanguard, however, will guide the people onto higher levels
of consciousness and]{.mark} in that way [bring them to the point where
they will take sterner actions in their own interests and against those
who continue to oppress them.]{.mark} As I\'ve said previously;
[revolution is a process,]{.mark} not a conclusion. [A true
revolutionist will not only take courageous
actions,]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~he~~ [[\[they\] will also try to advance
the people]{.mark} in such a manner that they will transform their
situation. That is, by delivering power to the people the true
revolutionist will help them define the social phenomena in their
community and lead them to the point where they will seize the time and
make these phenomena act in a desired manner.]{.underline}

#### 3. Advocacy Skills - Analysis around material change is essential to provide political training. Ignoring politics only cedes the political to the right and hurts those subject to carceral logic.

**Themba-Nixon 2k** (makani, Changing the rules what public policy means
for organizing Colorlines 3.2)

\*we do not endorse ableist language

In essence, [policies are the codification of power relationships and
resource allocation. [Policies are the rules of the world]{.mark} we
live in. [Changing the world means changing the
rules.]{.mark}]{.underline} So, [if organizing is about changing the
rules]{.underline} and building power, [[how can organizing be separated
from policies]{.underline}? [Can we really speak truth to
power,]{.underline}]{.mark} fight the right, stop corporate abuses, [[or
win racial justice without contesting the rules and the
rulers,]{.mark}]{.underline} the policies and the policymakers? [[The
answer is no-and double no for people of color.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Today, [racism subtly dominates nearly every aspect of
policymaking.]{.underline} From ballot propositions to city funding
priorities, policy is increasingly about the control, de-funding, and
disfranchisement of communities of color. What Do We Stand For? Take the
public conversation about welfare reform, for example. Most of us know
it isn\'t really about putting people to work. [[The right\'s message
was framed around racial stereotypes]{.mark} of lazy, cheating \"welfare
queens\" whose poverty was \"cultural.\" But]{.underline} the new
welfare policy was about moving billions of dollars in individual cash
payments and direct services from welfare recipients to other, more
powerful, social actors. [[Many]{.mark} of us [were too busy to tune
into the welfare policy]{.mark} drama in Washington, [only to find it
washed up right on our doorsteps.]{.mark}]{.underline} Our members are
suffering from workfare policies, new regulations, and cutoffs. Families
who were barely getting by under the old rules are being pushed over the
edge by the new policies. [Policy doesn\'t get more relevant than this.
And [so we got involved in policy-as defense. Yet]{.mark} we have to do
more than block their punches. [We have to start the fight with
initiatives of our own.]{.mark}]{.underline} Those who do are finding
offense a bit more fun than defense alone. Living wage ordinances, youth
development initiatives, even gun control and alcohol and tobacco
policies are finding their way onto the public agenda, thanks to focused
community organizing that leverages power for community-driven
initiatives. - Over 600 local policies have been passed to regulate the
tobacco industry. Local coalitions have taken the lead by writing
ordinances that address local problems and organizing broad support for
them. - Nearly 100 gun control and violence prevention policies have
been enacted since 1991. - Milwaukee, Boston, and Oakland are among the
cities that have passed living wage ordinances: local laws that
guarantee higher than minimum wages for workers, usually set as the
minimum needed to keep a family of four above poverty. These are just a
few of the examples that demonstrate how organizing for local policy
advocacy has made inroads in areas where positive national policy had
been stalled by conservatives. Increasingly, the local policy arena is
where the action is and where activists are finding success. Of course,
corporate interests-which are usually the target of these policies-are
gearing up in defense. Tactics include front groups, economic pressure,
and the tried and true: cold, hard cash. Despite these barriers,
grassroots organizing can be very effective at the smaller scale of
local politics. At the local level, we have greater access to elected
officials and officials have a greater reliance on their constituents
for reelection. For example, getting 400 people to show up at city hall
in just about any city in the U.S. is quite impressive. On the other
hand, 400 people at the state house or the Congress would have a less
significant impact. Add to that the fact that all 400 people at city
hall are usually constituents, and the impact is even greater. Recent
trends in government underscore the importance of local policy.
[[Congress has enacted a series of measures devolving significant power
to state and local government.]{.mark} Welfare, health care, and the
regulation of food and drinking water safety are among the areas where
states and localities now have greater rule.]{.underline} Devolution has
some negative consequences to be sure. History has taught us that, for
social services and civil rights in particular, the lack of clear
federal standards and mechanisms for accountability lead to uneven
enforcement and even discriminatory implementation of policies. Still,
there are real opportunities for advancing progressive initiatives in
this more localized environment. Greater local control can mean greater
community power to shape and implement important social policies that
were heretofore out of reach. To do so will require careful attention to
the mechanics of local policymaking and a clear blueprint of what we
stand for. Getting It in Writing [[Much of the work of framing]{.mark}
what we stand for [takes place in the shaping of demands.]{.mark} [By
getting into the policy arena in a proactive manner, we can take our
demands to the next level. Our demands can become law, with real
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline} if the agreement is broken. After all
the organizing, press work, and effort, a group should leave a decision
maker with more than a handshake and his or her word. [Of course, [this
work requires a certain amount of interaction with \"the
suits,\"]{.mark} as well as struggles with [the bureaucracy, the
technical language, and the]{.mark} all-too-common [resistance by
decision makers.]{.mark} Still[, if it\'s worth demanding, it\'s worth
having in writing-]{.mark}whether as law, regulation, or internal
policy.]{.underline} From ballot initiatives on rent control to laws
requiring worker protections, organizers are leveraging their power into
written policies that are making a real difference in their communities.
Of course, [policy work is just one tool in our organizing arsenal, but
it is a tool we simply can\'t afford to ignore. Making policy work an
integral part of organizing will require a certain amount of
retrofitting. [We will need to develop the capacity to translate our
information, data, and experience into stories that]{.mark} are designed
to [affect the public conversation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Perhaps most
important, [[we]{.mark} will [need to move beyond fighting problems and
on to framing solutions]{.mark} that bring us closer to our vision of
how things should be.]{.underline} And then we must be committed to
making it so.

#### Complete rejection of the real world institutional logic of civil society crushes anti-white supremacy projects

Kimberle **Crenshaw 1988**, law at UCLA, "Race, Reform, and
Retrenchment: Transformation and Legitimation in Antidscrimination Law
101," Harvard law review 1331//MMWang

The Critics\' product is of limited utility to Blacks in its present
form. [The implications for Blacks of trashing liberal legal ideology
are troubling, even though it may be proper to assail belief structures
that obscure liberating possibilities. [Trashing legal ideology]{.mark}
seems to [tell us repeatedly what has already been established]{.mark} -
that legal discourse is unstable and relatively
indeterminate.]{.underline} Furthermore, trashing offers no idea of how
to avoid the negative consequences of engaging in reformist discourse or
how to work around such consequences. [Even if we imagine the wrong
world when we think in terms of legal discourse, [we must]{.mark}
nevertheless [exist in a present world where legal protection has at
times been a blessing]{.mark} - albeit a mixed one.]{.underline} The
fundamental problem is that, although Critics criticize law because it
functions to legitimate existing institutional arrangements, it is
precisely this legitimating function that has made law receptive to
certain demands in this area. [[The Critical emphasis on
deconstruction]{.mark} as the vehicle for liberation [leads to the
conclusion that engaging in legal discourse should be avoided]{.mark}
because it reinforces not only the discourse itself but also the society
and the world that it embodies]{.underline}. Yet [[Critics offer little
beyond this]{.mark} observation. Their focus on delegitimating rights
rhetoric seems to suggest that, once rights rhetoric has been discarded,
[there exists a more productive strategy for change, one which does not
reinforce existing patterns of domination]{.mark}. Unfortunately, no
such strategy has yet been articulated, and it is difficult to imagine
that racial minorities will ever be able to discover one]{.underline}.
As Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward point out in their Tushnet
observes: [The conditions of the society define exactly what kind of
rights-talk makes sense, and the sort of rights-talk that makes sense in
turn defines what the society is. When someone objects to an act as a
violation of a right, the ensuing dialogue either involves a claim that
the challenged act is inconsistent with some \"deeper\" commitments that
the actor has . . . or deals with what kind of society we ought to have
excellent account of the civil rights movement, popular struggles are a
reflection of institutionally determined logic and a challenge to that
logic]{.underline}. 137 [[People can only demand change in ways that
reflect the logic of the institutions that they are
challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}.138 Demands for change that do not
reflect the institutional logic - that is, [[demands that do not
engage]{.mark} and subsequently reinforce the dominant ideology -
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[be
ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}. 139 [[The possibility for ideological
change is created through]{.mark} the very process of
[legitimation]{.mark}, which is [triggered by crisis.]{.mark} [Powerless
people can]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [[trigger]{.mark} such a
[crisis by challenging an institution internally]{.mark}, that is, by
using its own logic against it]{.underline}. 140 Such crisis occurs when
powerless people force open and politicize a contradiction between the
dominant ideology and their reality. The political conse- 137 See id. at
22-25. The observation concerning the inability to bring about change in
some non-legitimating fashion does not, of course, rule out the
possibility of armed revolution. **[[For most oppressed peoples]{.mark},
however, [the costs of]{.mark} such [a revolt are]{.mark} often [too
great]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, [[the oppressed cannot
realistically hope to overcome the \"coercive\" components of
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}. More importantly, [it is not clear that
such a struggle,]{.underline} although superficially a clear radical
challenge to the coercive force of the status quo, [would be a lesser
reinforcement of the ideology of American society]{.underline} (i.e.,
the consensual components of hegemony[). Consequences of maintaining the
contradictions may sometimes force an adjustment - an attempt to close
the gap or to make things appear fair.]{.underline} 141 Yet[, because
the adjustment is triggered by the political consequences of the
contradiction, [circumstances will be adjusted only to the extent
necessary to close the apparent contradiction. This approach]{.mark} to
understanding legitimation and change [is applicable to the civil rights
movement]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because Blacks were challenging their
exclusion from political society, the only claims that were likely to
achieve recognition were those that reflected American society\'s
institutional logic: legal rights ideology. Articulating their formal
demands through legal rights ideology, civil rights protesters exposed a
series of contradictions - the most important being the promised
privileges of American citizenship and the practice of absolute racial
subordination. Rather than using the contradictions to suggest that
American citizenship was itself illegitimate or false, civil rights
protestors proceeded as if American citizenship were real, and demanded
to exercise the \"rights\" that citizenship entailed. [By seeking to
restructure reality to reflect American mythology, [Blacks relied upon
and]{.mark} ultimately [benefited from politically inspired efforts to
resolve the contradictions]{.mark} by granting formal rights. Although
it is the need to maintain legitimacy that presents powerless groups
with the opportunity to wrest concessions from the dominant order, it is
the very accomplishment of legitimacy that forecloses greater
possibilities]{.underline}. In sum, [[the potential for change is both
created and limited by legitimation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Strategic resistance through institutional engagement can allow us to understand, expose, and destabilize whiteness

John **Powell 2005**, Williams Chair in Civil Liberties and Civil Rights
@ Moritz College of Law -- Ohio State University, Executive Director @
Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, "Dreaming of a
Self Beyond Whiteness and Isloation," Washington University Journal of
Law and Policy//MMWang

I am not suggesting that the interrogation of whiteness and the
privileges bound up in it is not useful. I have attempted to do some of
that in another article,82 but these approaches are both incomplete and
likely to be misdirected. Any particular focus on privilege as being
something that can possibly be separated from whiteness is likely to
leave the structure of whiteness in place with the reinscribing of a new
arrangement of privileges. [Any focus on the deconstruction of whiteness
through the individual intent of whites risks,]{.underline} as Wiegman
notes, ["reproducing . . . the white male rebel as the . . . subject of
antiracist struggle.]{.underline}"83 In our increasingly complicated
postmodern world, [transgression is much more complicated than deciding
"not to be white."]{.underline} One could point to the Civil War and the
Civil Rights Movement as two examples of the attempt to disturb white
privilege without striking at its core. But how are we to strike at the
core of white racial hierarchy? What I have been asserting throughout
this article is that we must address the ontological question. [This is
not a retreat from the possible or a retreat to the interior. It is not
just race that is socially constructed; so is the self]{.underline}.84
[[We must better understand and address how this self is constructed and
what maintains its attachment to whiteness]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} self,
and particularly the white [self, has a history]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Because the self has a history, [it is [constantly being made and
remade. This process goes largely unnoticed and hides behind]{.mark} a
veil of [naturalness]{.mark}]{.underline}. But it would be a serious
error to see this as only an internal undertaking. This is part of the
myth of the individual subject, that the self is internal and private.
We must expose the social nature of the subject. [[This subject is not
just held together by other subjects but also by our norms, practices
and institutions]{.mark}. This subject is related to other subjects and
to the world. Together [this creates a context that the subject lives in
both externally and internally]{.mark}.]{.underline} But this fix is
never perfect. [This context always denies some possibility that yearns
for expression. This yearning itself is part of the hope. As we think
about institutional arrangements, we must think about what they mean for
routine expression and the experience of internal space]{.underline}.
Unger reminds us that the way institutions are arranged will either
mutilate or provide space for the emancipation of our being.85 For those
of us with privilege, we must use those privileges we cannot reject to
better understand, expose, and destabilize the structures and cultural
norms that support and reinscribe whiteness. [[We must raise the cost of
maintaining whiteness by seeking strategic interventions]{.mark} that
reduce racialized disparities across multiple areas, [but still seek to
better understand and problematize whiteness. We must]{.mark} begin to
[work for a new set of arrangements]{.mark} that will support a new way
of relating, [a new way of being]{.mark}.]{.underline} So, part of this
answer is in the material world, the arrangements of structures and
institutions---not only because we need to address material needs and
disparities, but because structures are not separate from our self. But
[we must keep an eye on the self that we are trying to call into being.
[Without working on the interiorization of whiteness, we simply cannot
solve the problem of whiteness]{.mark}.]{.underline} There has been some
development in this region, but I believe that the ontological question
of whiteness remains largely undertheorized.86 [The purpose of this
understanding is to end the performance of whiteness, not so that whites
can be non-white or uncolored people, but so we can all be human with
all our social amalgamation and complexity that has so long been denied
and dreaded.]{.underline} Feminist theory has developed a view of the
self as radically relational. It is this relational self that whiteness
is created in, but fearful to acknowledge. How can we create communities
of kinship that allow us to explore these connections?

#### This replicates the revolutionary hero who limits their analysis to one time and place instead of formulating strategy to take theory and create replicable solution in the community. This prevents any ability to turn theory to praxis

Living wage ordinances, youth development initiatives, even gun control
and alcohol and tobacco policies are finding their way onto the public
agenda, thanks to focused community organizing that leverages power for
community-driven initiatives. - Over 600 local policies have been passed
to regulate the tobacco industry. Local coalitions have taken the lead
by writing ordinances that address local problems and organizing broad
support for them. - Nearly 100 gun control and violence prevention
policies have been enacted since 1991. - Milwaukee, Boston, and Oakland
are among the cities that have passed living wage ordinances: local laws
that guarantee higher than minimum wages for workers, usually set as the
minimum needed to keep a family of four above poverty. These are just a
few of the examples that demonstrate how organizing for local policy
advocacy has made inroads in areas where positive national policy had

grassroots organizing can be very effective at the smaller scale of
local politics. At the local level, we have greater access to elected
officials and officials have a greater reliance on their constituents
for reelection. For example, getting 400 people to show up at city hall
in just about any city in the U.S. is quite impressive. On the other
hand, 400 people at the state house or the Congress would have a less
significant impact. Add to that the fact that all 400 people at city
hall are usually constituents, and the impact is even greater. Recent
trends in government underscore the importance of local policy.
**[[Congress has enacted a series of measures devolving significant
power to state and local government.]{.mark} Welfare, health care, and

**Yancy 1** (George Yancy and Cornel West, \"Cornel West\", p 70) \*we

[The final component of the political construal of prophetic pragmatism
deals with the issue of power. Here, West announces that [prophetic
pragmatism will unmask the different power structures that present
themselves as natural.]{.mark}]{.underline} Along with this, he Ervors a
genealogical strategy that will similarly unearth the relevant practices
and systems of beliefs inappropriately dependent upon questionable moral
values. Confessing to his Foucauldian connections, he states that
"Prophetic pragmatism shares with Foucault a preoccupation with the
operation of powers. It also incorporates the genealogical mode of
inquiry \.... \[Plrophetic pragmatism promotes genealogical materialist
modes of analysis similar in many respects to those of Foucault.["3\"
West finally [construes prophetic pragmatism as]{.mark} a form of
[tragic thought.]{.mark} although not a "doomsday" form of thinking. To
the extent that [prophetic pragmatism evades involvement with a priori
epistemological concerns but instead focuses on the everyday
concerns]{.mark} of human beings, [West cautions that.]{.mark} despite
our efforts to better our existential condition, [both personal and
social evil are persistent realities not immediately submissive to our
intentions to do good.]{.mark} Evil's evasion of the good that we seek
to do will continue. West\'s focus on the presence of evil is not an
invitation to concede defeat but rather one to force us to become humble
as we realize that our best intentions are not immune to failure.
[Prophetic pragmatism]{.mark}. according to West, ["is a form of trage
thought]{.mark} in that it conlionts candidly individual and collective
experiences of evil in individuals and institutions - [with little
expectation of ridding the world of all evil."]{.mark}3\']{.underline}
As with his other construals. West links his conception of prophetic
pragmatism, as a fomi of tragic thought, with democracy. What he seems
to be getting at here is the idea that it is misleading to assume that
we can totally and completely realize the absolute ideal of democracy as
a historically manifested reality[. [Democracy remains an ideal that we
must constantly pursue while realizing that we are not pursuing an
illusion.]{.mark} The dynamics of human existence and the dialectical
tensions between human being and the natural world continually give rise
to various obstacles and challenges as we seek a more socially enriching
existence. Nevertheless, in acknowledging the constant struggle to
improve things, [West warns against surrendering to pessimism or
yielding to the]{.mark} seductive [idea of perfectibility.]{.mark}
Hence, he maintains: Prophetic pragmatism denies Sisyphean pessimism and
utopian perfectionism. Rather. it promotes the possibility of human
progress and human impossibility of paradise. [Human struggles its at
the center of prophetic pragmatism, a struggle guided by a democratic
and libertarian vision, sustained by]{.mark} moral [courage and]{.mark}
existential [integrity, and tempered by the recognition of]{.mark} human
[finitude and fragility."]{.mark}]{.underline} Clearly. West focuses
persistently upon the importance of creating "new possibilities for
human agency." He even briefly describes his prophetic pragmatism as a
form of historical consciousness attuned to the struggles of the past as
well as appreciative of the alternative forms of life based upon the
best of the past. [But he quickly interjects the theme of the tragic,
stating that the praxis of [prophetic pragmatism "is tragic action with
revolutionary intent.\"]{.mark}33 Finally, forever straddling two modes
of thought at once, West reiterates [that prophetic pragmatism is not
blind to the fact that utopian schemes]{.mark} QIIIJOK [escape the
limitation presented by the unfortunate condition of
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} and the structures of injustice
normally sustained by social, economic and political institutions. So,
even if prophetic pragmatism evades pessimism, it still cautiously
embraces utopianism. According to West: Prophetic pragmatism. . .
tempets its utopian impulse with a profound sense of the tragic
character of life and history. This sense of the tragic highlightst be
irreducible predicament of unique individuals who undergo dread,
despair, disillusionment, disease, and death and institutional forms of
oppression that dehumanize people." Now that we have some understanding
of \\Vest\'s impressionistic conception of prophetic pragmatism. we can
offer an evaluation of it. We should keep in mind, however, that thus
task is complicated by West\'s preference for a method of reading that
emphasizes moving the reader through passionate and motivational
rhetoric rather than the reader through the dispassionate execution of
arguments. Hence, in criticizing West, we must focus on the vision at
the heart of his prophetic pragmatism and not treat it as a systematic
body of truths.

#### It's a voting issue - You fail to ground your discourse in materiality -- you don't defend anything and understand the impacts of your inaction -- vote neg on presumption 

Rashad **Evans** writes while debating Casey Harrigan in 20**12**:
Rashad Evans, 2012 11-20-2012 (http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/)

[A quare approach to debate includes afro-pessimism. For instance, I am
pessimistic that any of the solutions being floated around will
meaningfully address anti-blackness. I am pessimistic of changes in MPJ,
resolutional wording or tournament practices to address the attitudinal
and structural (throwback) barriers to black participation in debate. A
quare approach to debate recognizes the importance that color, sex and
gender have in structuring our lives and producing differing results for
different people[. Disidentification is a way by which we can enact
change at the structural level through localized acts of
resistance]{.mark}. It is a process whereby we can work on and against
the system.]{.underline} I started this process at Harvard with the
initiation of my affirmative action policy and have continued on
facebook and my blog. **[[This disidentification is important because it
recognizes the material consequences of our actions and inactions. It
also allows individuals utilize discourse in a subversive
way]{.underline}]{.mark}**. E. Patrick Johnson explains that: "Foucault
himself acknowledges that discourse has the potential to disrupt power:
"Discourses are not once and for all subservient to power or raised up
against it, anymore than silences are. We must make allowances for
complex and unstable process whereby discourse can be both an instrument
and effect of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling block, a point of
resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Discourse
transmit and produces power; it reinforces it , but also undermines and
exposes it, renders it fragile and makes it possible to thwart it.
Although people of color, myself included, may not have theorized our
lives in Foucault's terms, we have used discourse in subversive ways
because it was necessary for our survival. Failure to ground discourse
in materiality is to privilege the position of those whose subjectivity
and agency, outside the realm of gender and sexuality, have never been
subjugated." Therefore, [[we must look look at the material consequences
of our acts]{.mark} and inactions and account for the ways in which
certain performances either maintain power or subvert
power.]{.underline} In addition, [we must account for stylistic
differences]{.underline}. It is at the level of style that most black
and queer politics are enacted. [In]{.underline} the
[debate]{.underline} space[, stylistic differences is one of the most
important ways that Black debaters enact their politics and resistance.
Style is an important tool of survival]{.underline} for Black, queer and
female debaters. [One cannot speak if she cannot speak with and from her
own voice]{.underline}. Style is important and so too is the value of
using the debate space to theorize about life more generally. Debate is
a homeplace for its participants. [[Theorizing about things like
anti-blackness, humanism and feminism from within the debate space is
important to teaching debaters how to theorize about this issues outside
the debate space]{.mark}.]{.underline} We must always be able to be
critical in those places where we are most familiar and most
comfortable. That is why these discussions regarding debate are so
important. [Important to a]{.underline} quare understanding of [debate
is the work done by D]{.underline}r. [S]{.underline}hanara
[R]{.underline}eid-[B]{.underline}rinkley and her call that we pay
specific attention to how we produce our scholarship. [Responsible
argumentation should account for multiple forms of knowledge including
(1) academic scholars, (2) organic intellectuals and (3) personal
experience.]{.underline} **[[Responsible debaters also engage in
knowledge production and not just knowledge
consumption.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### This replicates the revolutionary hero who limits their analysis to one time and place instead of formulating strategy to take theory and create replicable solution in the community. This prevents any ability to turn theory to praxis

[We see then that [power has a dual character]{.mark} and that [we
cannot]{.mark} simply [identify and define phenomena without
acting,]{.mark} for to do so is to become an armchair philosopher. And
when Bobby and I left Merritt College to organize brothers on the block
we did so because the college students were too content to sit around
and analyze without acting. On the other hand, [power includes
action]{.mark}, for it is making phenomena perform in the desired
manner. [But action without thinking and theory is also incorrect. If
the social forces]{.mark} at work in the community [have not been
correctly analyzed and defined, how can you control them]{.mark} in such
a way that they act in a desired manner? So the Black Panther Party has
always merged theory and practice in such a way as to serve the true
interests of the community. [In merging theory with practice]{.mark} we
recognized that [it was necessary to develop a theory which was valid
for more than one time and place.]{.mark} We wanted to develop a system
of which was good anywhere, thus it had to be rather abstract. Yet [our
theory would relate to a concrete analysis]{.mark} of concrete
conditions [so that our actions would always be relevant]{.mark} and
profitable to the people. Yet, at the same time, [it had to advance
their thinking so that they would move toward a transformation]{.mark}
of their situation of exploitation and oppression. We have always
insisted on good theory and good practice, but we have not always been
successful in carrying this through. When the Black Panther Party
defected from the Black community; we became, for a while, revolutionary
cultists. One of the primary characteristics of a revolutionary cultist
is that]{.underline} ~~he~~ \[[they\] despises everyone who has not
reached]{.underline} ~~his~~ [\[their\] level of consciousness, or the
level of consciousness that he \[they\] thinks ~~he has~~ \[they have\]
reached, instead of acting to bring the people to that level. In that
way the revolutionary cultist becomes divided from the
people,]{.underline} ~~he~~ [\[they\] defects from the community.
Instead of serving the people as a vanguard,]{.underline} ~~he~~
[\[they\] becomes a hero. Heroes engage in very courageous actions
sometimes, and they often make great sacrifices, including the supreme
sacrifice, but they are still isolated from the people. Their courageous
actions and sacrifices do not lead the people to a higher level of
consciousness, nor do they produce fundamental changes in the
exploitation and oppression of the people. [A vanguard,]{.mark}
however[, will guide the people onto higher levels of consciousness
and]{.mark} in that way [bring them to the point where they will take
sterner actions in their own interests and against those who continue to
oppress them.]{.mark} As I\'ve said previously; [revolution is a
process,]{.mark} not a conclusion. [A true revolutionist will not only
take courageous actions,]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~he~~ [[\[they\] will
also try to advance the people]{.mark} in such a manner that they will
transform their situation. That is, by delivering power to the people
the true revolutionist will help them define the social phenomena in
their community and lead them to the point where they will seize the
time and make these phenomena act in a desired manner.]{.underline}

####  []{.underline}2. Minority Participation-Adopting an ethereal view of power based on abstraction turns any attempts at political engagement because minorities NEED to have relatable political analysis. They make debate less relevant for people of color and lead to replicating the intellectual framework that is exclusionary and precludes revolutionary analysis, decreasing participation 

bell **hooks 1990**, black feminist and author, postmodern blackness

It is sadly ironic that **[[the contemporary discourse which talks the
most about heterogeneity]{.mark}, the decentered subject, [declaring
breakthroughs]{.mark} that allow recognition of otherness,
[still]{.mark} [directs its critical voice]{.mark} primarily [to a
specialized audience]{.mark},]{.underline}** one that shares a common
language rooted in the very master narratives it claims to challenge.
**[[If radical postmodernist thinking is to have a transformative impact
then a critical break]{.mark} with the notion of \"authority\" as
\"mastery over\" [must]{.mark} not simply be a rhetorical device, it
must [be reflected in habits of being, including styles of writing as
well as chosen subject matter.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Third-world
scholars, especially elites, and white critics who passively absorb
white supremacist thinking, and therefore never notice or look at black
people on the streets, at their jobs, who render us invisible with their
gaze in all areas of daily life, are not likely to produce liberatory
theory that will challenge racist domination, or to promote a breakdown
in traditional ways of seeing and thinking about reality, ways of
constructing aesthetic theory and practice. From a different standpoint
Robert Storr makes a similar critique in the global issue of \_Art in
America\_ when he asserts: To be sure, much **[[postmodernist critical
inquiry has centered]{.mark} precisely [on the issues of \"difference\"
and \"otherness.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** On the purely theoretical
plane the exploration of these concepts has produced some important
results, but **[[in the absence of any sustained research]{.mark} into
what artists of color and others outside the mainstream might be up to,
[such discussions become rootless instead of
radical.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Endless second guessing about the latent
imperialism of intruding upon other cultures only compounded matters,
preventing or excusing these theorists from investigating what black,
Hispanic, Asian and Native American artists were actually doing.
**[Without adequate concrete knowledge of and contact with the non-white
\"other,\" [white theorists]{.mark} may [move in discursive theoretical
directions that are threatening to and]{.mark} potentially [disruptive
of that critical practice]{.mark} which would support radical liberation
struggle.]{.underline}**

####  []{.underline}3. Revolutionary education- Contextualizing analysis around material change is essential to provide political training. Ignoring politics only cedes the political to the right which UNIQULY hurts people of color. We must gain the tools to fight power in the halls of power on OUR terms

**Themba-Nixon 2k** (makani, Changing the rules what public policy means
for organizing Colorlines 3.2)

\*we do not endorse ableist language

In essence, [**policies are the codification of power relationships and
resource allocation. [Policies are the rules of the world]{.mark} we
live in.** [Changing the world means changing the
rules.]{.mark}]{.underline} So, **[if organizing is about changing the
rules]{.underline}** and building power, [[how can organizing be
separated from policies]{.underline}? **[Can we really speak truth to
power,]{.underline}**]{.mark} fight the right, stop corporate abuses,
**[[or win racial justice without contesting the rules and the
rulers,]{.mark}]{.underline}** the policies and the policymakers? [[The
answer is no-and double no for people of color.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Today, **[racism subtly dominates nearly every aspect of
policymaking.]{.underline}** From ballot propositions to city funding
priorities, policy is increasingly about the control, de-funding, and
disfranchisement of communities of color. What Do We Stand For? Take the
public conversation about welfare reform, for example. Most of us know
it isn\'t really about putting people to work. **[[The right\'s message
was framed around racial stereotypes]{.mark} of lazy, cheating \"welfare
queens\" whose poverty was \"cultural.\" But]{.underline}** the new
welfare policy was about moving billions of dollars in individual cash
payments and direct services from welfare recipients to other, more
powerful, social actors. [**[Many]{.mark} of us [were too busy to tune
into the welfare policy]{.mark} drama in Washington, [only to find it
]{.mark}**[washed up right on our doorsteps.]{.mark}]{.underline} Our
members are suffering from workfare policies, new regulations, and
cutoffs. Families who were barely getting by under the old rules are
being pushed over the edge by the new policies. **[Policy doesn\'t get
more relevant than this. And so we got involved in policy-as defense.
Yet we have to do more than block their punches. [We have to start the
fight with initiatives of our own.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Those who do
are finding offense a bit more fun than defense alone. Living wage
ordinances, youth development initiatives, even gun control and alcohol
and tobacco policies are finding their way onto the public agenda,
thanks to focused community organizing that leverages power for
community-driven initiatives. - Over 600 local policies have been passed
to regulate the tobacco industry. Local coalitions have taken the lead
by writing ordinances that address local problems and organizing broad
support for them. - Nearly 100 gun control and violence prevention
policies have been enacted since 1991. - Milwaukee, Boston, and Oakland
are among the cities that have passed living wage ordinances: local laws
that guarantee higher than minimum wages for workers, usually set as the
minimum needed to keep a family of four above poverty. These are just a
few of the examples that demonstrate how organizing for local policy
advocacy has made inroads in areas where positive national policy had
been stalled by conservatives. Increasingly, the local policy arena is
where the action is and where activists are finding success. Of course,
corporate interests-which are usually the target of these policies-are
gearing up in defense. Tactics include front groups, economic pressure,
and the tried and true: cold, hard cash. Despite these barriers,
grassroots organizing can be very effective at the smaller scale of
local politics. At the local level, we have greater access to elected
officials and officials have a greater reliance on their constituents
for reelection. For example, getting 400 people to show up at city hall
in just about any city in the U.S. is quite impressive. On the other
hand, 400 people at the state house or the Congress would have a less
significant impact. Add to that the fact that all 400 people at city
hall are usually constituents, and the impact is even greater. Recent
trends in government underscore the importance of local policy.
**[[Congress has]{.mark} enacted a series of measures [devolv]{.mark}ing
[significant power to state and local government.]{.mark} Welfare,
health care, and the regulation of food and drinking water safety are
among the areas where states and localities now have greater
rule.]{.underline}** Devolution has some negative consequences to be
sure. History has taught us that, for social services and civil rights
in particular, the lack of clear federal standards and mechanisms for
accountability lead to uneven enforcement and even discriminatory
implementation of policies. Still, there are real opportunities for
advancing progressive initiatives in this more localized environment.
Greater local control can mean greater community power to shape and
implement important social policies that were heretofore out of reach.
To do so will require careful attention to the mechanics of local
policymaking and a clear blueprint of what we stand for. Getting It in
Writing **[[Much of the work of framing]{.mark} what we stand for [takes
place in the shaping of demands.]{.mark} [By getting into the policy
arena in a proactive manner,]{.mark} we can take our demands to the next
level. [Our demands can become law, with real
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}** if the agreement is broken. After
all the organizing, press work, and effort, a group should leave a
decision maker with more than a handshake and his or her word. **[Of
course, [this]{.mark} work [requires]{.mark} a certain amount of
[interaction with \"the suits,\"]{.mark} as well as struggles with [the
bureaucracy, the technical language, and the]{.mark} all-too-common
[resistance by decision makers.]{.mark} Still[, if it\'s worth
demanding, it\'s worth having in writing-]{.mark}whether as law,
regulation, or internal policy.]{.underline}** From ballot initiatives
on rent control to laws requiring worker protections, organizers are
leveraging their power into written policies that are making a real
difference in their communities. Of course, [**policy work is just one
tool in our organizing arsenal, but it is a tool we simply can\'t afford
to ignore. Making policy work an integral part of organizing will
require a certain amount of retrofitting.** [We will need to develop the
capacity to translate our information]{.mark}**, data, and experience
[into]{.mark} [stories that]{.mark} are designed to** [affect the public
conversation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Perhaps most important,
[**[we]{.mark} will [need to move]{.mark} beyond fighting problems and
on [to ]{.mark}**[framing solutions]{.mark} **that bring us closer to
our vision of how things should be.**]{.underline} And then we must be
committed to making it so.

#### Only a complete shattering of European philosophical framework through adopting a focus on material conditions can solve

Marimba **Ani**. Yurugu: An African-Centered Critique of European
Cultural Thought and Behavior. March 19**94** Pg.329-331

It has been part of the posture of **[[the moral philosophers of
European culture]{.underline}]{.mark}** to disavow cultural commitment,
yet their work has contributed significantly to the survival and
intensification of the rhetorical ethic-the hypocrisy and the deception
that constitute a vital and definitive part of the content of European
cultural imperial- ism-and, therefore, to nationalistic objectives. To
begin with the Platonic-influenced utamawazo
**[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark}**s **[[the theoretical basis
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** a conceptual ethics**[;]{.underline}** **[[an
ethical system,]{.mark}]{.underline}** the themes of which are
considered to be valid, as long as they are consistent in terms of the
logic of that system. **[What is [\"ethical\" becomes]{.mark} what is
[\"rational\" and \"logical.\" The most \"ethical\" statement is the
purest abstraction.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Havelock correctly
observes, **[the individual \"thinking\" psyche becomes the seat of
morality and [the individual\'s ability to act ethically is based on
]{.mark}]{.underline}**~~his~~ \[[[their]{.underline}\] **[ability to
think \"]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[rationally\"; i.e., [\"abstractly.\"
The result,]{.mark} again[, is \"talk.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[The
European idea is that words divorced from action, feeling,
commitment,]{.mark} from human [involvement can them- selves be
relevant]{.mark} to]{.underline}** (and properly inform) **[human
interaction-]{.underline}**as long as they are part of a consistent
syntax; an approved semantical system. **[This pursuit itself is an
exercise in self-deception. Primary cultures are characterized by an
\"existential ethic\"]{.underline}** (Stanley Diamond) **[that is based
on and refers to actual behavior. European culture gives rise to
semantical systems and instead of being concerned with the inconsistency
between \"word\" and \"deed]{.underline}**\" (which could conceivably be
the determinant of ethical behaVior), **[[the moral philosophers are
merely concerned with verbal and]{.mark} what they call [\"logical\"
inconsistency]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[One result]{.mark} of
this characteristic of the culture [is]{.mark} a tendency [to]{.mark}
make philosophers the most irrelevant of people and to effectively
[divorce their work from]{.mark} any [decision-making
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}** or role that in any way influences the
ethical behavior of European peoples. What this tradition has done
instead is to support the culture in its ability to use words without
meaning, and to support Europeans in their quest to deceive others and
themselves as well. The body of literature known as \"ethical theory\"
has to a large degree been conducive to the growth of moral hypocrisy in
European culture. It is the \"liberal\" academic tradition in
contemporary European/ European American culture that uses the
rhetorical ethic best to sup- port the objectives of European
chauvinism. **[Ingeniously these [theo- rists]{.mark} use the semantical
systems of the moral philosophers, the \"brotherhood\"
rhetoric]{.underline}** of the Christian statement and **[empty
abstractions like \"humanitarianism\" and \"universalistic ethics\" as
evidence of the ideological commitments]{.underline}** of the Europeans
and therefore as indices of the nature of European culture. **[They [are
\"critical,\" because they say that the imperialistic behavior of the
European has represented a]{.mark} conflicting theme or [\"negative\"
tendency in European development]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The result
of their theories, however[,]{.mark} is that they succeed in [making the
European responsible for everything-]{.mark}the \"good\" as well as the
\"bad\"-[and]{.mark} in the end [the good]{.mark} far [outweighs the
bad]{.mark} and will,]{.underline}** of course, triumph along with
\"reason.\" Norman F. Cantor provides an excellent example of the subtle
chauvinism of the European liberal academician in his work on Western
culture. He says, **[[The]{.mark} new [ethos]{.mark} of the late 1960\'s
[sought to restore]{.mark} to their central place in Western culture
[the religious, mystical, compassionate]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
imaginative, and altruistic ideals that had been tarnished or ignored by
industrialism and secularism, **[[by the mechanism and bureaucracy of
modern life]{.mark}. 22]{.underline}** The new ethos had indigenous
roots in some of the central cur- rents of the Western tradition-in
Christian mysticism, in the Enlightenment\'s vision of a happy and
peaceful world, in Romanticism\'s yearning of the union of self and
nature and for the union of all individuals in the Absolute Spirit, in
anarchism\'s faith in the spontaneous association of men in a harmonious
community when freed from the brutality and oppression of the state, in
Nietzsche\'s life-affirming ethic and Freud\'s revelation of the pri-
macy of erotic impulses, and in the existential philosophy of Camus,
Sartre, and Jaspers. 23 The trick is to \"claim\" ideas that have failed
to influence the def- inition of the culture: because they do not fit in
with the asili. In this way, \\any critique of European ideology
informed by a vision of the human that could only have been created
either by a rejection of European value or in a culture qualitatively
different from European culture itself becomes a \"Western\" product.
**[And [this argument]{.mark} (if \"argued\" at all) [is made on the
basis of values that were]{.mark}, for the European, [never more than
rhetoric! \"]{.mark}]{.underline}**Christian mysticism\" becomes
\"Western,\" and the \"Enlightenment\'s vision of a happy world\" is not
tarnished by the fact that this world was to be defined in terms of and
controlled by European \"progress.\" **[Cantor\'s characterization of
\"Western liberalism\" is a perfect statement of what I have called the
\"rhetorical ethic.\"]{.underline}** In the statement that follows,
taken from the concluding paragraphs of his three-vol- ume work on
European cultural history, Cantor claims, for the cul- ture, its most
severe critics. Movements that would seek the destruction of what the
West has meant are characterized as expres- sions of Western humanism
and of Western ideals. This excerpt is evi- dence of the characteristic
of European cultural nationalism that we are here delineating. **[This
particular example is all the more signifi- cant because it represents a
fairly recently published text, used to explain and interpret to the
European-American college student, the nature and meaning of
Western-European history: It is a pernicious misreading of history to
identify Western civiliza- tion with the racism, imperialism, and
capitalism of the late nine- teenth century. Even in their heyday, these
attitudes and institutions were only one side of the Western world view
and way of life. [The destiny of Western civilization immeasurably
transcends the mistakes of one era.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The West has
had its confusion, horror, and misery, its moments when anti-human
doctrine have seemed on the verge of carrying all before them. But it is
the glory of Western civilization that it has never stood still and has
never neglected for long the quest for institutions that can contribute
to the realization of human freedom. **[Soon its best minds have
recalled the highest ideals of the classical and Christian traditions;
they have inspired their contemporaries with the vision of a great age
of beginning anew,]{.underline}** of the establishment of God\'s kingdom
on earth or a secular equivalent in their own time.\" Cantor concludes
his panegyric with the assurance that the \"great upheavals of the
1960\'s were collectively only manifestations of the age-old western
tradition by which Western \'civilization\' peri- odically \'renews
itsel!.\'\" In this way he debunks the need for revolu- tion; and in
fact \"claims\" the revolutionaries, who, he says, will ineVitably and
happily be overshadowed by the \"rationalists and moderates, II who have
restructured the institutions of the past and redirected the ideas of
the present. **[[The result has never been perfect]{.mark} justice or
absolute truth [but sufficient]{.mark} justice [and enough]{.mark} truth
to satisfy the anxieties of the contemporary era [while
reestablishing]{.mark} the [social peace and political order]{.mark}
that the progress of civilization requires.]{.underline}**22 And so ends
Cantor\'s historical study of the \"genesis and des- tiny\" of Western
culture. With its greatest minds as the custodians of
\"civilization\"-not just \"European civilization.\" **[My
interpretation of that history is quite different, as it is informed by
an African-centered perspective and methodology. Cantor is concerned
lest the students of the \"new ethos\" would \"shatter\" and irrevocably
separate from what has historically been Western European culture. Our
conclusion is that [the European tradition must be \"shattered\" if
a]{.mark} truly [\"new ethos\" is to replace the old.
]{.mark}]{.underline}**This means a new utamaroho to fulfill a different
asiii. **[But then centered in African interest I understand [European
culture to be identifi]{.mark}ed [with]{.mark} anti-Africanism, [the
imperialistic pursuit,]{.mark} and [with a denial of the human
spirit;]{.mark}]{.underline}** whereas Cantor finds this identification
\"pernicious\" and makes the claim that the \"liberation of the human
spirit\" has been a \"central current\" in the Western tradition.
Ultimately Cantor\'s objectives are chauvinistic. **[[He is concerned
with influencing students]{.mark} in such a way that they will act [to
maintain the]{.mark} \"peace\" and \"order\" necessary for the
continuance of the [European conception of \"progress,\"]{.mark} i.e.,
[the persistence of]{.mark} European [power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### 5. Pragmatism-Their desire to seek a perfect conceptual understanding of power before reengaging the political makes the good the enemy of the perfect, something people of color cannot afford. Our call allows for politics combined with critical analysis of power relations making us the perfect middle ground 

**Yancy 1** (George Yancy and Cornel West, \"Cornel West\", p 70) \*we
do not endorse ableist language

[The final component of the political construal of prophetic pragmatism
deals with the issue of power. Here, West announces that [prophetic
pragmatism will unmask the different power structures that present
themselves as natural.]{.mark}]{.underline} Along with this, he Ervors a
genealogical strategy that will similarly unearth the relevant practices
and systems of beliefs inappropriately dependent upon questionable moral
values. Confessing to his Foucauldian connections, he states that
"Prophetic pragmatism shares with Foucault a preoccupation with the
operation of powers. It also incorporates the genealogical mode of
inquiry \.... \[Plrophetic pragmatism promotes genealogical materialist
modes of analysis similar in many respects to those of Foucault.["3\"
West finally [construes prophetic pragmatism as]{.mark} a form of
[tragic thought.]{.mark} although not a "doomsday" form of thinking. To
the extent that [prophetic pragmatism evades involvement with a priori
epistemological concerns but instead focuses on the everyday
concerns]{.mark} of human beings, West cautions that. despite our
efforts to better our existential condition, [both personal and social
evil are persistent realities not immediately submissive to our
intentions to do good.]{.mark} Evil's evasion of the good that we seek
to do will continue. West\'s focus on the presence of evil is not an
invitation to concede defeat but rather one to force us to become humble
as we realize that our best intentions are not immune to failure.
[Prophetic pragmatism]{.mark}. according to West, ["is a form of trage
thought]{.mark} in that it conlionts candidly individual and collective
experiences of evil in individuals and institutions - [with little
expectation of ridding the world of all evil."]{.mark}3\']{.underline}
As with his other construals. West links his conception of prophetic
pragmatism, as a fomi of tragic thought, with democracy. What he seems
to be getting at here is the idea that it is misleading to assume that
we can totally and completely realize the absolute ideal of democracy as
a historically manifested reality[. [Democracy remains an ideal that we
must constantly pursue while realizing that we are not pursuing an
illusion.]{.mark} The dynamics of human existence and the dialectical
tensions between human being and the natural world continually give rise
to various obstacles and challenges as we seek a more socially enriching
existence. Nevertheless, in acknowledging the constant struggle to
improve things, [West warns against surrendering to pessimism or
yielding to the]{.mark} seductive [idea of perfectibility.]{.mark}
Hence, he maintains: Prophetic pragmatism denies Sisyphean pessimism and
utopian perfectionism. Rather. it promotes the possibility of human
progress and human impossibility of paradise. [Human struggles its at
the center of prophetic pragmatism, a struggle guided by a democratic
and libertarian vision, sustained by]{.mark} moral [courage and]{.mark}
existential [integrity, and tempered by the recognition of]{.mark} human
[finitude and fragility."]{.mark}]{.underline} Clearly. West focuses
persistently upon the importance of creating "new possibilities for
human agency." He even briefly describes his prophetic pragmatism as a
form of historical consciousness attuned to the struggles of the past as
well as appreciative of the alternative forms of life based upon the
best of the past. [But he quickly interjects the theme of the tragic,
stating that the praxis of [prophetic pragmatism "is tragic action with
revolutionary intent.\"]{.mark}33 Finally, forever straddling two modes
of thought at once, West reiterates [that prophetic pragmatism is not
blind to the fact that utopian schemes]{.mark} QIIIJOK [escape the
limitation presented by the unfortunate condition of
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} and the structures of injustice
normally sustained by social, economic and political institutions. So,
even if prophetic pragmatism evades pessimism, it still cautiously
embraces utopianism. According to West: Prophetic pragmatism. . .
tempets its utopian impulse with a profound sense of the tragic
character of life and history. This sense of the tragic highlightst be
irreducible predicament of unique individuals who undergo dread,
despair, disillusionment, disease, and death and institutional forms of
oppression that dehumanize people." Now that we have some understanding
of \\Vest\'s impressionistic conception of prophetic pragmatism. we can
offer an evaluation of it. We should keep in mind, however, that thus
task is complicated by West\'s preference for a method of reading that
emphasizes moving the reader through passionate and motivational
rhetoric rather than the reader through the dispassionate execution of
arguments. Hence, in criticizing West, we must focus on the vision at
the heart of his prophetic pragmatism and not treat it as a systematic
body of truths.

#### 6. Switch Side Debate

#### Preserving negative ground key to fairness for minorities in debate. You don't have to suppress your identities to affirm, you must infuse your identity into public discourse and discussion -- going negative solves all your offense.

Rashad **Evans,** 20**12**. 11-20-2012 (http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/)

I will accept this definition, but I think it requires some more
refinement. In a practical sense, [SSD, at a minimum, requires that the
affirmative defend the resolution.]{.underline} For the most part, [the
negative is unconstrained (except by competition) and most debates in
which SSD comes up the question is whether the affirmative team should
be required to affirm the topic, including some defense of an action by
the United States Federal Government ("USFG"). The essential question
posed by SSD is whether the affirmative team should be required to
defend the resolution even when they (1) fundamentally disagree with all
or part of it and/or (2) are compelled to affirm other ideas because of
their "personal convictions."]{.underline} The answer to this question
must be yes. First, [there are multiple ways to skin a cat and even more
ways to affirm the resolution in the world of parametric debate because
one need only affirm an interpretation of the resolution and not the
resolution writ large.]{.underline} **[Therefore, there are rare
instances in which there is no interpretation of the resolution that you
cannot defend and these rare instances are most likely the product of
lack of creativity and research.]{.underline}** So in reality, the
question is an even simpler one: should the affirmative team be required
to defend an interpretation of the resolution. There are immense
constitutive and instrumental benefits to SSD that cannot be otherwise
obtained and therefore must be required. I ask that the judges: George,
Justin and Kyla evaluate this debate holistically, which requires that
they evaluate the benefits of SSD to the speaker (constitutive) and to
society (instrumental). This also requires that they exclude nothing in
their analysis of this debate. The Constitutive [Debaters benefit from
SSD.]{.underline} [It requires that they engage in topics that they may
not otherwise engage. The resolution poses a unique question and the
debate round is a unique time to answer that question.]{.underline} [One
is much more likely to consider their personal convictions outside of
the debate round than they are to consider the resolution outside the
debate round. Therefore, independently of whether one agrees with the
resolution or not, there are benefits to defending an interpretation of
the resolution in that it requires you to consider something you may not
have otherwise considered. These thought expiriments create more
informed and thoughtful debaters and citizens. **SSD creates a unique
opportunity for self-reflexivity.**]{.underline} The idea is to let your
personal convictions guide you in the debate. [The resolution doesn't
require that you suppress your identity or convictions, but is instead
an opportunity to infuse that identity and those
convictions]{.underline} [into the resolution and public policy
discussion.]{.underline} [So, given who you are, what you believe and
what you know what say you regarding energy production? What say you
regarding democracy assistance? What say you regarding federal control
in Indian Country? Therefore, the resolution is an opportunity for you
to refine your personal convictions and put your identity in politics
instead of relying exclusively on identity politics.]{.underline} **[SSD
allows you to check your own privilege.]{.underline}** Here, I will rely
on my personal experience. I once participated in a 30 day creative
challenge where the challenge leader would pose questions on facebook
and the group would answer them in the comments section. One day he
asked us to imagine we could be the other gender for 3 days and to
discuss what would we do. I thought about this on the A-train from
Harlem to Chelsea and again from Chelsea to Harlem and had no answer
because I couldn't imagine being a woman. I explained that as a gay man
I don't need to be a woman to have sex with a man, [I don't want a baby
in me and more importantly I don't want the physical vulnerability of
being a woman. This realization really forced me to
reevaluate]{.underline} my previous jokes even that as a gay many I was
ontologically indistinct from a woman. I am not. I am gay and I am
black...in many ways I am the the worlds bottom, but even I could would
not want to occupy the body of a woman. [That thought experiment taught
me a lot about myself, privilege and the world. Sometimes, you have to
take a walk in someone else's stiletto to learn who you really
are]{.underline}. Seriously CH, have you walked in stilettos? It will
change your life. [SSD is both necessary and sufficient to ensure that
you debate your personal convictions]{.underline}. Remember, if [you are
staunchly opposed to the resolution you get to lodge those complaints on
the negative.]{.underline} Also, [remember that what is good for the
goose is good for the gander and if you don't have to debate the
resolution then no one has to debate the resolution. This loosening of
the restrictions on the resolution may mean that no one gets to debate
anything they want]{.underline}. I mean lets face it, no one wants to be
topical! [There's always a better version of your aff that isn't
topical. Every 2AC considers severance or intrinsicness because the
resolution is flawed or insufficient. However, a true debater
understands that they both have to debate on the affirmative and the
negative and that in order to do either effectively there must be
stability in the relationship between the affirmative and the negative.
Therefore, committing yourself to the resolution is key preserving your
own negative ground to engage in your critique of the resolution. As
goes the resolution so goes your personal convictions about that
resolution.]{.underline} The Instrumental [SSD is the only way to
organize a fair debate tournament. We must have a topic. There must be
rules and allowing any and everyone go rogue because of their "personal
convictions" it is a recipe for disaster.]{.underline} I don't want to
live and debate in that world. **[There must be strict requirements on
defending the resolution to allow for fair and predictable negative
ground.]{.underline}** By the way, [protecting fair negative ground is
easier and more important than all other concerns regarding
fairness.]{.underline} [All people of all convictions have to be
negative at some point. Which means that the affirmative-negative
dialiectic is the only intersectional analysis that can be performed
because all people of all identities will eventually find themselves on
the affirmative or negative side in debate. Preserving negative ground
then preserves the ground of women, minorities and hippies. SSD ensures
that we have all hands on deck in these extraordinary times. We need all
perspectives and all peoples to engage in all debates. SSD facilitates
this. Allowing students to pick their own topic]{.underline} because of
their "personal convictions" may [mean that important issues get ignored
all together]{.underline}. I mean, what would happen if we let the
students set the curriculum? Would they learn anything, ever? How many
times have you heard these questions in a classroom: why do I have to
learn this? Will this be on the exam? My major is X, why do I need to
learn Y? Blah. Yes, students would almost always like to do what they
want to do. If we allowed this where would we be as a country? Who will
be there to tackle the important questions pertaining to immigration,
energy production, the Arab Spring, etc? [Engaging the resolution from
your specific social location can cause others to change their
views.]{.underline} There are several examples of creative
interpretations of the resolution that have inspired folk to view the
topic and life differently. This is when debate is at its best and when
it's engaging in important knowledge production. [Debate and debaters
have the potential to infuse new arguments, ideas and perspectives into
the resolution and into the broader discussion.]{.underline}

#### State engagement is key -- Asian feminist jurisprudence is the best starting point to challenged white sexual imperialism -- only by engaging macro-level institutions can solve the impact of the 1AC

interactive dynamic of gender as an inequality\'\'2 09 and \"aggression
against those with less power is experienced as sexual pleasure, an
entitlement of masculinity,, 210 it is the White male\'s sexual
dominance over the Asian female which emerges as the source of
inequality that the Asian female suffers. Moreover, for Asian feminist
jurisprudence, \"colonial and military domination are interwoven with
sexual domination.\" 21 \' [The [Western military\'s involvement in

predominantly [White men and]{.mark} the sellers of [their bodies for

the West. This [imbalance of power came from White men imperializing
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}2 13 and, [in the course of conquest, the
taking of Asian women\'s bodies as their spoils]{.underline}. 214 The
pervasiveness of [[sexual objectification establishes]{.mark} in the
minds of Westerners [a stereotype of Asian women as
hyper-sexualized]{.mark}, since their only utility to Westerners for

We Go From Here? The U.S. recognizes the profound harms that the
institution of slavery caused during the early parts of American history

it from textbooks in neutral language. [No sense of penance comes with

[[Considering]{.mark} the general trends]{.underline} of the Asian and

from the American media\'s portrayal of them as effeminate, and many
Asian women\'s subconscious preference for dating White men over Asian
men-a trend which has become increasingly popular. [White men display
the \"Asian fetish\" syndrome, a symptom of not only the desire for male
dominance, but also the imported stereotype that Asian women want to be

studies have looked at sexual violence against Asian women.218 This
Article urges continued and active scholarship in Asian feminist
jurisprudence, particularly through the fisheye lens of White sexual
imperialism. Understanding intersectionality issues with the historical
dimension of colonialism will help expose otherwise latent forces that
work at conserving injurious sex and race disparities.

#### Operating within formal politics can challenge biopower---reform key to engagement 

**Foucault**, French Sociologist, 19**88** (Michel, "On Criticism" in
[Michel Foucault: Politics Philosophy Culture Interviews and other
writings 1977- 1984]{.underline})

D.E. You mean it will be possible to work with this government?
FOUCAULT: **We must escape from the dilemma of being either for or
against.** After all, **[it is possible to face up to a government and
remain standing. To work with a govern­ment implies neither subjection
nor total acceptance. One may work with it and yet be restive]{.mark}**.
I even believe that **[the two]{.mark}** things **[go
together]{.mark}**. D.E. After Michel Foucault the critic, are we now
going to see Michel Foucault the reformist? After all, the reproach was
often made that the criticism made by intellectuals leads to nothing.
FOUCAULT First I'll answer the point about "that leads to nothing."
There are hundreds and thousands of people who have worked for the
emergence of a number of problems that are now on the agenda. To say
that this work produced nothing is quite wrong. Do you think that twenty
years ago people were considering the problems of the relationship
between mental illness and psychological normality, the problem of
prison, the problem of medical power, the problem of the relationship
between the sexes, and so on, as they are doing today? Furthermore,
there are no reforms as such. Reforms are not produced in the air,
independently of those who carry them out. One cannot not take account
of those who will have the job of carrying out this transformation. And,
then, above all, I believe that an opposition can be made between
critique and transformation, "ideal" critique and "real" transformation.
A critique is not a matter of saying that things are not right as they
are. It is a matter of pointing out on what kinds of assumptions, what
kinds of familiar, unchallenged, uncon­sidered modes of thought the
practices that we accept rest. We must free ourselves from the
sacrilization of the social as the only reality and stop regarding as
superfluous something so essential in human life and in human relations
as thought. Thought exists independently of systems and structures of
discourse. It is something that is often hidden, but which always
animates everyday behavior. There is always a little thought even in the
most stupid institutions; there is always thought even in silent habits.
**[Criticism is]{.mark} a matter of flushing out that thought and trying
to change it[: to show that things are not as self-evident as]{.mark}**
one **[believed]{.mark}**, to see that what is accepted as self-evident
will no longer be accepted as such. **Practicing criticism is a matter
of making facile gestures difficult.** In these circumstances, criticism
(and radical criticism) is absolutely indispensable for any
transformation. A transform­ation that remains within the same mode of
thought, a transformation that is only a way of adjusting the same
thought more closely to the reality of things can merely be a
superficial transformation. On the other hand, **[as soon as one can no
longer think things as one formerly thought them, transformation
becomes]{.mark}** both very urgent, very difficult, and quite
**[possible]{.mark}**. It is not therefore a question of there being a
time for criticism and a time for transformation, nor people who do the
criticism and others who do the transforming, those who are enclosed in
an inaccessible radicalism and those who are forced to make the
necessary concessions to reality. In fact I think **the work of deep
transformation can only be carried out in a free atmosphere, one
constantly agitated by a permanent criticism.** D.E. But do you think
the intellectual must have a programmatic role in this transformation?
FOUCAULT **A [reform]{.mark} is never only the result of a process in
which there is conflict**, confrontation, struggle, resistance To say to
oneself at the outset: what reform will I be able to carry out? That is
not, I believe, an aim for the intellectual to pursue. His role, since
he works specifically in the realm of thought, is to see how far the
liberation of thought can make those transformations urgent enough for
people to want to carry them out and difficult enough to carry out for
them to be profoundly rooted in reality. **It [is a question of making
conflicts more visible, of making them more essential than mere
confrontations of interests]{.mark}** or mere institutional immobility.
**[Out of these]{.mark} conflicts**, these confrontations, [**a new
power relation must emerge, whose first, temporary expression will be a
reform**.]{.mark} If at the base there has not been the work of thought
upon itself and if, in fact, modes of thought, that is to say modes of
action, have not been altered, whatever the project for reform, we know
that it will be swamped, digested by modes of behavior and institutions
that will always be the same.

#### Theory is irrelevant absent specific application -- must combine theory and political action

Foucault '82 \[Michel, "Politics and Ethics: An Interview," The Foucault
Reader, Trans. Catherine Porter, Ed. Paul Rabinow, 373-4\]

Q. There is much talk in America these days comparing your work to that
of Jurgen Habermas. It has been suggested that your work is more
concerned with ethics and his with politics. Habermas, for example, grew
up reading Heidegger as a politically disastrous heir of Nietzsche. He
associates Heidegger with German neo-conservatism. He thinks of these
people as the conservative heirs of Nietzsche and of you as the
anarchistic heir. You don\'t read the philosophical tradition this way
at all, do you? M.F. That\'s right. When Habermas was in Paris, we
talked at some length, and in fact I was quite struck by his observation
of the extent to which the problem of Heidegger and of the political
implications of Heidegger\'s thought was quite a pressing and important
one for him. One thing he said to me has left me musing, and it\'s
something I\'d like to mull over further. **After explaining how
Heidegger\'s thought indeed constituted a political disaster, he
mentioned one of his professors who was a great Kantian**, very
well-known in the \'30s, and he explained how astonished and
disappointed he had been when, while looking through card catalogues one
day, he found some texts from around 1934 by this illustrious Kantian
that **were thoroughly Nazi in orientation.** I have just recently had
the same experience with Max Pohlenz, who heralded the universal values
of Stoicism all his life. I came across a text of his from 1934 devoted
to Fiihrertum in Stoicism. You should reread the introductory page and
the book\'s closing remarks on the Fuhrersideal and on the true humanism
constituted by the Volk under the inspiration of the leader\'s
direction-Heidegger never wrote anything more disturbing. Nothing in
this condemns Stoicism or Kantianism, needless to say. But I think that
we must reckon with several facts**: [there is a very tenuous
\"analytic\" link between a philosophical conception and the concrete
political attitude]{.mark}** of someone who is appealing to it; **[the
\"best\" theories do not constitute a very effective protection against
disastrous political choices; certain great themes]{.mark}** such as
\"humanism\" **can be used to any end whatever-**for example, to show
with what gratitude Pohlenz would have greeted Hitler. I do not conclude
from this that one may say just anything within the order of theory,
but, on the contrary, that **[a demanding, prudent, \"experimental\"
attitude is necesary]{.mark}; at every moment**, step by step**, [one
must confront what one is thinking and saying with what one is
doing]{.mark}**, with what one is. I have never been too concerned about
people who say: \"You are bor‑rowing ideas from Nietzsche; well,
Nietzsche was used by the Nazis, therefore. . .\"; but, on the other
hand, **[I have always been concerned with linking together as tightly
as possible the historical and theoretical analysis of]{.mark} power
relations**[, **institu‑tions**]{.mark}, and knowledge**, [to]{.mark}
the movements, [critiques]{.mark}, and experiences that call them into
question in reality.** If I have insisted on all this \"practice,\" it
has not been in order to \"apply\" ideas, but in order to put them to
the test and modify them. **The key to the Personal poetic attitude of a
philosopher is not to be sought in** his **ideas**, as if it could be
deduced from them, **but rather in** his **philosophy-as-life**, in his
philosophicallife, his ethos. Among the French philosophers who
participated in the Resistance **[during the war]{.mark}**, one was
Cavailles, a historian of mathematics who was interested in the
development of its internal structures. **[None of the philosophers
of]{.mark}** *[engagement]{.underline}‑*Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir,
Merleau-Ponty-none of them **[did a thing.]{.mark}**

**Policy engagement is vital in effectively challenging the excesses of
neoliberalism - rejection is a form of utopianism that stifles
progressive politics**

**Giroux and Polychroniou 14** (Henry and CJ, Global Television Network

They are the enemies of democracy and are crucial in creating
subjectivities and values that buy into the notion that capital rather
than people are the subject of history and that consuming is the only
obligation of citizenship. Their goal is to normalize the ideologies,
modes of governance and policies that reproduce massive inequities and
suffering for the many, and exorbitant and dangerous privileges for the
corporate and financial elite. Moreover, such intellectuals are
symptomic of the fact that **[neoliberalism represents a new historical
conjuncture in which cultural institutions and political power have
taken on a whole new life in shaping politics]{.underline}**. What this
suggests is that the left in its various registers has to create its own
public intellectuals in higher education, the alternative media and all
of those spaces where meaning circulates. **[[Intellectuals have a
responsibility to connect their work to]{.mark} important [social
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**, work with popular movements **[[and
engage in the shaping of policies]{.mark} that benefit all people and
not simply a few]{.underline}**. At the heart of this suggestion is the
need to recognize that ideas matter in the battle against
authoritarianism and that pedagogy must be central to any viable notion
of politics and collective struggle. **[Public intellectuals have [an
obligation to work for global peace, individual freedom]{.mark}, care of
others, economic justice and democratic participation]{.underline}**,
especially at a time of legitimized violence and tyranny. I completely
agree with the late Pierre Bourdieu when he insisted that there is
enormous political importance \"to defend the possibility and necessity
of the intellectual, who is firstly critical of the existing state of
affairs. There is no genuine democracy without genuine opposing critical
power.\" The very notion of being an engaged public intellectual is
neither foreign to nor a violation of what it means to be an academic
scholar, but central to its very definition. Put simply, **[academics
have a duty to enter into the public sphere unafraid to take positions
and generate controversy]{.underline}**, functioning as moral witnesses,
raising political awareness and **[making connections to those elements
of power and politics often hidden from public view]{.underline}**. One
final question. Are you optimistic about the future of the left and of
progressive politics in general? It is impossible to be on the left and
at the same time surrender to the normalization of a dystopian vision[.
**[One has to be optimistic, but also realistic]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[This means that [there is no room for]{.mark} a kind of [romanticized
utopianism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, **[one has to be motivated
by a faith in the willingness]{.underline}** of young people principally
**[to fight for a future in which dignity, equality and justice matter
and]{.underline}** at the same time **[recognize the forces that are
preventing such a struggle]{.underline}**. More specifically, [**[hope
has to be fed by the need for collective action]{.underline}**. **[Power
is never completely on the side of domination and resistance is not a
luxury but a necessity]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As Stanley Aronowitz has
argued **[[the left has to]{.underline}]{.mark}** engage the issue of
economic inequality, overcome its fragmentation, develop an
international social formation for radical democracy and the defense of
the public good, undertake ways to finance itself, take seriously the
educative nature of politics and the need to change the way people
think, and [**[develop a comprehensive notion of politics and a vision
to match]{.underline}**.]{.mark} History is open, though the gates are
closing fast. The issue for me personally is not whether I am
pessimistic, but how am I going to use whatever intellectual resources I
have to make it harder to prevent various events and problems from
getting worse while at the same time struggling for a society in which
the promise of democracy appears on the horizon of possibility.

embedded. (Reed, 2000: 526-7) [These [institutional
stabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[include]{.mark} market relations,
the [power of the state]{.mark}]{.underline}, relations like
[[colonialism]{.mark}, kinship and patriarchy. [These]{.mark} are the
\'generative properties\']{.underline} that Reed (1998: 210) understands
as [[\'mak(]{.mark}ing) [social practices]{.mark} and forms - [such as
discursive formations - what they are]{.mark} and]{.underline}
equip(ing) them with [what they do\'.]{.underline} Equally Thompson and
Ackroyd also argue that in discourse analysis \'workers are not
disciplined by the market, or sanctions actually or potentially invoked
by capital, but their own subjectivities\' (1995: 627). [The inability
to examine structures such as capitalism means that some basic forms of
power are thus uninvestigated.]{.underline} Focusing solely on
entrepreneurship discourse within organisations and the workplace would
lead to a situation where pertinent relations that do not enter into
discourse are taken to not exist. [[Such oversights]{.mark} in
discursive analyses are that often structural relations such
as]{.underline} class and [the state [have become so reified]{.mark} in
social]{.underline} and mental [worlds that [they
disappear]{.mark}.]{.underline} An ironic outcome indeed. [[Even
when]{.mark} this [structural context is considered, it is]{.mark} often
[examined in **broad**, **oversimplified**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[[**underspecified** manners]{.mark}.]{.underline} This attention to
social structure can be an important part of developing a critical
theory of entrepreneurship, as we remember that the existing structural
arrangements at any point are not inevitable, but can be subjected to
criticism and change. [In order to deal with these problems, we need to
revive the concept of social structure.]{.underline} Thus [we are
arguing that [\'there exist in the social world itself]{.mark} and [not
only within symbolic systems]{.mark}]{.underline} (language, myths,
etc.) **[[objective]{.mark} [structures independent of]{.mark} the
consciousness and [will of agents,]{.mark} which [are capable of guiding
and constraining]{.mark} their [practices or]{.mark} their
[representations\']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bourdieu, 1990: 122).
[[Objective]{.mark} still [means socially constructed, but social
constructions]{.mark} that [have become **solidified as structures
external to individual subjects**. Examples]{.mark} of these
structures]{.underline} may [[include]{.mark} basic \'organising
principals\' which are relatively stable]{.underline} and spatially and
historically situated [such as [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline},
kinship, patriarchy [and the state**.**]{.underline} Some
entrepreneurship researchers, particularly those drawing on sociology
and political science, have shown the importance of social structure for
understanding entrepreneurship (see for example Swedberg, 2000).

#### Resistance over participation maintains the status quo -- we need genuine political engagement to enact change

Jeffrey **Pyle 99**---Boston College Law School, J.D., magna cum laude,
"Race, Equality and the Rule of Law: Critical Race Theory\'s Attack on
the Promises of Liberalism," 40 B.C.L. Rev. 787, pgs 807-808//MMWang

For all their talk of \"realism,\"\'[\" race-crits are]{.underline}
strangely [unrealistic in their proposals for reform]{.underline}. 1 m 7
Most probably realize that radical measures like racial or ethnic
reparations are not likely to be granted, especially by a court. But
[even unrealistic proposals are rare, because race-crits generally
prefer not to suggest solutions, but to \"resist\" the dominant legal
thought, doctrine and policy, whatever that happens to
be.]{.underline}\'\" As Derrick Bell has put it, \"[[most
critical]{.mark} race [theorists are committed to]{.mark} a program of
scholarly [resistance]{.mark}, and most hope scholarly resistance will
lay the groundwork for wide-scale resistance]{.underline}.\"\'\" [[How
this ivory tower oppositionalism would foment grassroots revolt is
unclear]{.mark}, because CRT professors rarely suggest anything
practical.]{.underline} Rather, their exhortations are meant, as Bell
says, to \"harass white folks\" and • thereby \"make life bearable in a
society where blacks are a permanent, subordinate class.\"\'\" One of
the race-erns\' few practical programs of \"resistance\" is Paul
Butler\'s proposal that inner-city juries practice racially-based jury
nullification.\' 91 jurors of color, Butler argues, have the \"moral
responsibility\" not to apply the criminal law to blacks and whites
equally, but to \"etnancipate some guilty black outlaws\" because \"the
black community\" would be \"better off\" if there were fewer black men
in prison.\'\" If enough juries were hung or not-guilty verdicts
rendered, he imagines, the white-dominated government would change its
excessive reliance on incarceration.\'\" Butler rejects the ordinary
democratic process of legal reform.\' Democracy, he says, ensures a
\"permanent, homogenous majority\" of whites that \"dominat\[es\]\"
African Ainericans.w5 Butler is probably correct that occasional acts of
jury nullification might well express the resentment that many African
Americans justifiably feel towards discriminatory law
enforcement.\'\"\`\' As Randall Kennedy has pointed out, however, black
Americans are disproportionately the victims of crimes,\' 97 and
therefore tend to favor more, not less, criminal prosecution and
punishment. 1 \"8 [[The]{.mark} race-crits\' [preference for
\"resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}\"\' 99 [[over]{.mark} democratic
[participation seems to flow from a fear of losing their status as
\"oppositional scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}\] \"200 [to the game of
mainstream law and politics, which they regard as \"an inevitably
co-optive process?\"\' [Better to be radically opposed]{.mark} to the
\"dominant political discourse]{.underline}\"\"2 [and remain an outsider
[than to work within the current system and lose one\'s
\"authenticity?\" In rejecting the realistic for the
\"authentic]{.mark}]{.underline},\" however, [race-[crits begin to look
like academic poseurs]{.mark}---ideological purists striking the correct
radical stance, but [doing little within the confines of the real world,
so sure]{.mark} are they [that nothing]{.mark} much [can be
done.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Must start from within dominant discourses---abstract criticisms of feminism fail to bring about real world change

**Saloom**, **6.** JD Univ of Georgia School of Law and M.A. in Middle
Eastern Studies from U of Chicago, Fall 2006

\[Rachel, *A Feminist Inquiry into International Law and International
Relations*, 12 Roger Williams U. L. Rev. 159, l/n, Stevens\]

Tickner\'s last point that deserves further reflection is the notion
that international law and international relations will not become free
from gender bias as long as we live in a gendered world. This is not to
say that small steps are ineffective, but rather that international law
and **international relations are merely a small part of the larger
systemic problem of unequal gender relations. While it is desirable that
more women occupy foreign** and military **policy making positions,
this** \"desire\" **does not** necessarily **transform the way**
international law and **international relations work. [To
allege]{.mark}** that **[this]{.mark}** is the case **[assume]{.mark}s**
that **[women have an essential character that can transform the
system.]{.mark}** This of course is contrary to the very arguments that
most gender theorists forward, because **it would mean that women have
some unique \"feminine\" perspective. What is needed** then **is a
release from the sole preoccupation on women and men**. The state\'s
masculinist nature that gender theorists critique affects everyone in
society. **[Moving beyond the \"add and stir\" approach is quite
difficult, but there must be a starting point]{.mark}** from which
gender theorists can work.
[105](http://web.lexis-nexis.com/scholastic/document?_m=a2ac53a45e1fe17371cdbaa2cf370390&_docnum=3&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkVk&_md5=2c8e9aab339ea5ca4d4f4fae4578bb53#n105#n105)
**[If everything is problematized, paralysis will inevitably occur.
Working within the current framework is]{.mark}** truly [**the only
option to bring about change**. **Lofty abstract criticisms will do
nothing to change the practices**]{.mark} **of** international law and
[international relations.]{.underline} **Pragmatic feminist criticisms**
of international law and international relations, however, **should be
further developed.** Even advocates of realist thought will admit that
realism is neither the most accurate nor the only way to view the world.
[106](http://web.lexis-nexis.com/scholastic/document?_m=a2ac53a45e1fe17371cdbaa2cf370390&_docnum=3&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkVk&_md5=2c8e9aab339ea5ca4d4f4fae4578bb53#n106#n106)
The changing dynamics of world politics make formulating new ways of
understanding international relations quite pertinent. **[Keeping some
semblance of realism in tact, while at the same time opening up space
for theorizing about other possibilities, is necessary]{.mark}.**
Critics are quick to note that realism cannot be easily abandoned
without some sort of alternative framework. Casting aside realism now,
even given the concerns of gender scholars, is not the most promising
option. Wayman and Diehl note that  \[\*180\]  \"**[the abandonment of
realism leaves a void, which in the short to medium term is at least as
much of a dead end as would be the result of following
realism]{.mark}**.\"
[107](http://web.lexis-nexis.com/scholastic/document?_m=a2ac53a45e1fe17371cdbaa2cf370390&_docnum=3&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkVk&_md5=2c8e9aab339ea5ca4d4f4fae4578bb53#n107#n107)
**New possibilities can be envisioned while still adhering to some** of
the **realist ideologies.** Wayman and Diehl describe realism as a
detour and not a definitive road map.
[108](http://web.lexis-nexis.com/scholastic/document?_m=a2ac53a45e1fe17371cdbaa2cf370390&_docnum=3&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkVk&_md5=2c8e9aab339ea5ca4d4f4fae4578bb53#n108#n108)
Thus, theorists must admit that realism is not the only way or the
correct way to view international law and international relations, but
it cannot be totally abandoned. Even given all of the criticisms of
feminist theories, there must be space, however, for feminist
theorization. **A pragmatic approach should not dismiss the benefits of
theorizing.** Discussions and debates on feminism and international law
and relations are extremely important. Yet even where feminist
discourses lack the social power to realize their versions of knowledge
in institutional practices, they can offer the discursive space from
which the individual can resist dominant subject positions\... .
Resistance to the dominant at the level of the individual subject

**Institutional configurations exist independently of and shape
micro-politics**

**Wight 6** -- Professor of IR @ University of Sydney -- 6

(Colin, Agents, Structures and International Relations: Politics as
Ontology, pgs. 48-50

One important aspect of this relational ontology is that these relations
constitute our identity as social actors. According to this relational
model of societies, one is what one is, by virtue of the relations
within which one is embedded. A worker is only a worker by virtue of
his/her relationship to his/her employer and vice versa. 'Our social
being is constituted by relations and our social acts presuppose them.'
At any particular moment in time **[[an individual may be implicated in
all manner of relations]{.mark},]{.underline}** each exerting its own
peculiar causal effects. **[[This 'lattice-work']{.mark}]{.underline}**
of relations constitutes the structure of particular societies and
**[[endures despite changes in]{.mark} the [individuals]{.mark}
occupying them]{.underline}**. Thus, the relations, the structures, are
ontologically distinct from the individuals who enter into them. At a
minimum, the social sciences are concerned with two distinct, although
mutually interdependent, strata. There is an ontological difference
between people and structures: 'people are not relations, societies are
not conscious agents'. Any attempt to explain one in terms of the other
should be rejected. If there is an ontological difference between
society and people, however, we need to elaborate on the relationship
between them. Bhaskar argues that we need a system of mediating
concepts, encompassing both aspects of the duality of praxis into which
active subjects must fit in order to reproduce it: that is, a system of
concepts designating **[[the 'point of contact']{.mark} between human
agency and social structures. This [is]{.mark} known as a '[positioned
practice']{.mark}]{.underline}** system. In many respects, the idea of
'positioned practice' is very similar to Pierre Bourdieu's notion of
*habitus*. Bourdieu is primarily concerned with what individuals do in
their daily lives. He is keen to refute the idea that social activity
can be understood solely in terms of individual decision-making, or as
determined by surpa-individual objective structures. Bourdieu's notion
of the habitus can be viewed as a bridge-building exercise across the
explanatory gap between two extremes. Importantly, the notion of a
habitus can only be understood in relation to the concept of a 'social
field'. According to Bourdieu, a social field is 'a network, or a
configuration, of objective relations between positions objectively
defined'. **[[A social field]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, refers to a
structured system of social positions occupied by individuals and/or
institutions -- the nature of which **[[defines the situation
for]{.mark} their [occupants]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is a social
field whose form is constituted in terms of the relations which define
it as a field of a certain type. A *habitus* (positioned practices) is a
mediating link between individuals' subjective worlds and the
socio-cultural world into which they are born and which they share with
others. The power of the habitus derives from the thoughtlessness of
**[[habit]{.mark}]{.underline}** and habituation, rather than
consciously learned rules. The habitus is imprinted and encoded in a
socializing process that commences during early childhood. It **[[is
inculcated more by experience than]{.mark} by [explicit teaching.
Socially competent performances are produced as]{.mark} a matter of
[routine, without]{.mark} explicit [reference to]{.mark} a body of
[codified knowledge]{.mark}, and without the actors necessarily knowing
what they are doing (in the sense of being able adequately to explain
what they are doing).]{.underline}** As such, the *habitus* can be seen
as the site of 'internalization of reality and the externalization of
internality.' Thus social practices are produced in, and by, the
encounter between: (1) the *habitus* and its dispositions; (2) the
constraints and demands of the socio-cultural field to which the habitus
is appropriate or within; and (3) the dispositions of the individual
agents located within both the socio-cultural field and the *habitus*.
When placed within Bhaskar's stratified complex social ontology the
model we have is as depicted in Figure 1. The explanation of practices
will require all three levels. **[[Society]{.mark}, as field of
relations, [exists]{.mark} prior to, and is [independent of,
individual]{.mark} and collective [understandings at any]{.mark}
particular moment in [time]{.mark}]{.underline}**; that is, social
action requires the conditions for action. Likewise, **[[given that
behavior is]{.mark}]{.underline}** seemingly recurrent, patterned,
ordered, **[[institutionalised]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and displays a
degree of stability over time, **[[there must be]{.mark} sets of
[relations]{.mark} and rules [that govern it.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Contrary to individualist theory, these relations, rules and roles are
not dependent upon either knowledge of them by particular individuals,
or the existence of actions by particular individuals; that is,
**[[their explanation cannot be reduced to
consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark}** or to the attributes **[[of
individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These emergent social forms must
possess emergent powers. This leads on to arguments for the reality of
society baswed on a causal criterion. Society, as opposed to the
individuals that constitute it, is, as Foucault has put it, 'a complex
and independent reality that has its own laws and mechanisms of
reaction, its regulations as well as its possibility of disturbance.
This new reality is society...It becomes necessary to reflect upon it,
upon its specific characteristics, its constants and its variables'.

#### Only political engagement can challenge a heteronormative society on a broad scale and effectuate change

Benjamin **Bateman 2006**, doctoral candidate in English at the
University of Virginia, Spring 2006, "The Future of Queer Theory," The
Minnesota Review//MMWang

Queer theorists more politically programmatic than Edelman frequently
neglect this point. Michael [[Warner]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example,
[[accuses gays and lesbians who aspire to marriage]{.mark} of
caving]{.underline}, in assimilationist fashion, [[to heterosexual
norms]{.mark} perceived as demands. [But queers never exist completely
outside such norms---and thus cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
logically, [[succumb]{.mark} to them]{.underline}---and marriage and
childrearing might not look the same with gays on board. After all, gays
who have been traumatized by their parents\' homophobia and lessons of
compulsory heterosexuality are probably less likely than their
heterosexual counterparts to repeat such mistakes. Insofar as married
gays retain connections to less traditional elements of queer culture,
[[we cannot assume that they will abandon their fights]{.mark} for
sexual freedom, [conform entirely to]{.mark} all matrimonial
[traditions, or turn their backs]{.mark} upon their promiscuous peers.
[Some might, but many will not. Edelman]{.mark}\'s book [works well as
an]{.mark} intensely [academic]{.mark} polemic [but as a political
resource it proves insufficient. If queer theory is to have a social
impact, it must interpellate]{.mark} the gay and lesbian audience [to
whom]{.mark}]{.underline}, after all, [[it is]{.mark} primarily
[addressed. Few of these people,]{.mark} we can safely assume, [want to
live in a void or die Antigone\'s death. Queer culture should keep
insisting that we not sacrifice present,]{.mark}]{.underline} pressing
needs to heterosexual fantasies, [[but to secure its future it must
imagine a political order]{.underline}]{.mark} in which the needs of
children are not inimical to the interests of queers, [[and it must
celebrate]{.underline}]{.mark}---as Eve Sedgwick does so passionately in
\"How to Grow Your Kids Up Gay\"---[[that which is most queer, and
queer-able]{.mark}, in children.]{.underline}

#### Reformism is an effective method of change and may bring revolution closer 

Richard **Delgado 2009**, self-appointed Minority scholar, Chair of law
at the U of Alabama law schoo, books have won eight national book
prizes, including a Pulitzer nomination, teaching and writings focus on
race, the legal profession, and social change, "Does Critical Legal
Studies have what minorities want, arguing about law," pgs
588-590//MMWang

2\. The CLS critique of piecemeal reform [Critical scholars reject the
idea of piecemeal reform]{.underline}. Incremental change, they argue,
merely postpones the wholesale reformation that must occur to create a
decent society. Even worse, an unfair social system survives by using
piecemeal reform to disguise and legitimize oppression. Those who
control the system weaken resistance by pointing to the occasional
concession to, or periodic court victory of, a black plaintiff or worker
as evidence that the system is fair and just. In fact, Crits believe
that teaching the common law or using the case method in law school is a
disguised means of preaching incrementalism and thereby maintaining the
current power structure." To avoid this, CLS scholars urge law
professors to abandon the case method, give up the effort to ﬁnd
rationality and order in the case law, and teach in an unabashedly
political fashion. [[The]{.mark} CLS [critique of piecemeal reform is
familiar, imperialistic and wrong]{.mark}. Minorities know from bitter
experience that occasional court victories do not mean the Promised Land
is at hand. [The critique is imperialistic in that it tells]{.mark}
minorities and other [oppressed peoples how they should interpret events
affecting them. A court order directing a housing authority]{.mark} to
disburse funds for heating in subsidized housing [may postpone the
revolution, or it may not.]{.mark} In the meantime, [the order keeps a
number of poor families warm. This may mean more to them than it does to
a comfortable academic]{.mark} working in a warm office. It smacks of
paternalism to assert that the possibility of revolution later outweighs
the certainty of heat now]{.underline}, unless there is evidence for
that possibility. The Crits do not offer such evidence. Indeed, some
[[incremental changes may bring revolutionary changes closer]{.mark},
not push them further away. [Not all small reforms induce
complacency;]{.mark}]{.underline} some may whet the appetite for further
combat. The welfare family may hold a tenants' union meeting in their
heated living room. [CLS scholars' [critique of piecemeal reform]{.mark}
often [misses these possibilities, and neglects]{.mark} the question of
[whether total change,]{.mark} when it comes, [will be what we
want.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Critiquing existing security structures isn't enough -- political action is necessary

Pinar **Bilgin** (Department of International Relations Bilkent
University Ankara) **05** "Regional Security in the Middle East" p. 60-1

Admittedly[, **providing a critique of**]{.mark} **existing approaches
to [security]{.mark}**, revealing those hidden assumptions and normative
projects embedded in Cold War Security Studies, is only a first step. In
other words, from a critical security perspective, [self-reflection,
thinking]{.underline} and writing **[are not enough in themselves. They
should be compounded by]{.mark}** other forms of practice (that is,
**[action]{.mark} taken on the ground)**. It is indeed crucial for
students of critical approaches to re-think security in both theory and
practice by pointing to possibilities for change immanent in world
politics and suggesting emancipatory practices if it is going to fulfil
the promise of becoming a \'force of change\' in world politics.
Cognisant of the need to find and suggest alternative practices to meet
a broadened security agenda without adopting militarised or zero-sum
thinking and practices, students of critical approaches to security have
suggested the imagining, creation and nurturing of security communities
as emancipatory practices (Booth 1994a; Booth and Vale 1997). Although
Devetak\'s approach to the theory/practice relationship echoes critical
approaches\' conception of theory as a form of practice, the latter
seeks to go further in shaping global practices. The distinction Booth
makes between \'thinking about thinking\' and \'thinking about doing\'
grasps the difference between the two. Booth (1997:114) writes:
**[Thinking about thinking is important, but, more urgently, so is
thinking about doing]{.mark}**.... **[Abstract ideas]{.mark} about
emancipation [will not suffice: it is important for Critical Security
Studies to engage with the real by suggesting policies, agents, and
sites of change]{.mark}**[, to help humankind]{.underline}, in whole and
in part, to move away from its structural wrongs. [In this
sense,]{.underline} **[providing a critique of existing approaches to
security]{.mark}**[,]{.underline} revealing those hidden assumptions and
normative projects embedded in Cold War Security Studies**, [is only
a]{.mark}** first (albeit crucial) **[step]{.mark}.** [It is vital for
the students]{.underline} of critical approaches [to re-think security
in both theory and practice.]{.underline}

#### Complete rejection of the institutional logic of civil society crushes anti-white supremacy projects

Kimberle **Crenshaw 1988**, law at UCLA, "Race, Reform, and
Retrenchment: Transformation and Legitimation in Antidscrimination Law
101," Harvard law review 1331//MMWang

The Critics\' product is of limited utility to Blacks in its present
form. [The implications for Blacks of trashing liberal legal ideology
are troubling, even though it may be proper to assail belief structures
that obscure liberating possibilities. [Trashing legal ideology]{.mark}
seems to [tell us repeatedly what has already been established]{.mark} -
that legal discourse is unstable and relatively
indeterminate.]{.underline} Furthermore, trashing offers no idea of how
to avoid the negative consequences of engaging in reformist discourse or
how to work around such consequences. [Even if we imagine the wrong
world when we think in terms of legal discourse, [we must]{.mark}
nevertheless [exist in a present world where legal protection has at
times been a blessing]{.mark} - albeit a mixed one.]{.underline} The
fundamental problem is that, although Critics criticize law because it
functions to legitimate existing institutional arrangements, it is
precisely this legitimating function that has made law receptive to
certain demands in this area. [[The Critical emphasis on
deconstruction]{.mark} as the vehicle for liberation [leads to the
conclusion that engaging in legal discourse should be avoided]{.mark}
because it reinforces not only the discourse itself but also the society
and the world that it embodies]{.underline}. Yet [[Critics offer little
beyond this]{.mark} observation. Their focus on delegitimating rights
rhetoric seems to suggest that, once rights rhetoric has been discarded,
[there exists a more productive strategy for change, one which does not
reinforce existing patterns of domination]{.mark}. Unfortunately, no
such strategy has yet been articulated, and it is difficult to imagine
that racial minorities will ever be able to discover one]{.underline}.
As Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward point out in their Tushnet
observes: [The conditions of the society define exactly what kind of
rights-talk makes sense, and the sort of rights-talk that makes sense in
turn defines what the society is. When someone objects to an act as a
violation of a right, the ensuing dialogue either involves a claim that
the challenged act is inconsistent with some \"deeper\" commitments that
the actor has . . . or deals with what kind of society we ought to have
excellent account of the civil rights movement, popular struggles are a
reflection of institutionally determined logic and a challenge to that
logic]{.underline}. 137 [[People can only demand change in ways that
reflect the logic of the institutions that they are
challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}.138 Demands for change that do not
reflect the institutional logic - that is, [[demands that do not
engage]{.mark} and subsequently reinforce the dominant ideology -
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[be
ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}. 139 [[The possibility for ideological
change is created through]{.mark} the very process of
[legitimation]{.mark}, which is [triggered by crisis.]{.mark} [Powerless
people can]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [[trigger]{.mark} such a
[crisis by challenging an institution internally]{.mark}, that is, by
using its own logic against it]{.underline}. 140 Such crisis occurs when
powerless people force open and politicize a contradiction between the
dominant ideology and their reality. The political conse- 137 See id. at
22-25. The observation concerning the inability to bring about change in
some non-legitimating fashion does not, of course, rule out the
possibility of armed revolution. **[[For most oppressed peoples]{.mark},
however, [the costs of]{.mark} such [a revolt are]{.mark} often [too
great]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, [[the oppressed cannot
realistically hope to overcome the \"coercive\" components of
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}. More importantly, [it is not clear that
such a struggle,]{.underline} although superficially a clear radical
challenge to the coercive force of the status quo, [would be a lesser
reinforcement of the ideology of American society]{.underline} (i.e.,
the consensual components of hegemony[). Consequences of maintaining the
contradictions may sometimes force an adjustment - an attempt to close
the gap or to make things appear fair.]{.underline} 141 Yet[, because
the adjustment is triggered by the political consequences of the
contradiction, [circumstances will be adjusted only to the extent
necessary to close the apparent contradiction. This approach]{.mark} to
understanding legitimation and change [is applicable to the civil rights
movement]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because Blacks were challenging their
exclusion from political society, the only claims that were likely to
achieve recognition were those that reflected American society\'s
institutional logic: legal rights ideology. Articulating their formal
demands through legal rights ideology, civil rights protesters exposed a
series of contradictions - the most important being the promised
privileges of American citizenship and the practice of absolute racial
subordination. Rather than using the contradictions to suggest that
American citizenship was itself illegitimate or false, civil rights
protestors proceeded as if American citizenship were real, and demanded
to exercise the \"rights\" that citizenship entailed. [By seeking to
restructure reality to reflect American mythology, [Blacks relied upon
and]{.mark} ultimately [benefited from politically inspired efforts to
resolve the contradictions]{.mark} by granting formal rights. Although
it is the need to maintain legitimacy that presents powerless groups
with the opportunity to wrest concessions from the dominant order, it is
the very accomplishment of legitimacy that forecloses greater
possibilities]{.underline}. In sum, [[the potential for change is both
created and limited by legitimation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Strategic resistance through institutional engagement can allow us to understand, expose, and destabilize whiteness

Self Beyond Whiteness and Isloation," Washington University Journal of
Law and Policy//MMWang

I am not suggesting that the interrogation of whiteness and the
privileges bound up in it is not useful. I have attempted to do some of
that in another article,82 but these approaches are both incomplete and
likely to be misdirected. Any particular focus on privilege as being
something that can possibly be separated from whiteness is likely to
leave the structure of whiteness in place with the reinscribing of a new
arrangement of privileges. [Any focus on the deconstruction of whiteness
through the individual intent of whites risks,]{.underline} as Wiegman
notes, ["reproducing . . . the white male rebel as the . . . subject of
antiracist struggle.]{.underline}"83 In our increasingly complicated
postmodern world, [transgression is much more complicated than deciding
"not to be white."]{.underline} One could point to the Civil War and the
Civil Rights Movement as two examples of the attempt to disturb white
privilege without striking at its core. But how are we to strike at the
core of white racial hierarchy? What I have been asserting throughout
this article is that we must address the ontological question. [This is
not a retreat from the possible or a retreat to the interior. It is not
just race that is socially constructed; so is the self]{.underline}.84
[[We must better understand and address how this self is constructed and
what maintains its attachment to whiteness]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} self,
and particularly the white [self, has a history]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Because the self has a history, [it is [constantly being made and
remade. This process goes largely unnoticed and hides behind]{.mark} a
veil of [naturalness]{.mark}]{.underline}. But it would be a serious
error to see this as only an internal undertaking. This is part of the
myth of the individual subject, that the self is internal and private.
We must expose the social nature of the subject. [[This subject is not
just held together by other subjects but also by our norms, practices
and institutions]{.mark}. This subject is related to other subjects and
to the world. Together [this creates a context that the subject lives in
both externally and internally]{.mark}.]{.underline} But this fix is
never perfect. [This context always denies some possibility that yearns
for expression. This yearning itself is part of the hope. As we think
about institutional arrangements, we must think about what they mean for
routine expression and the experience of internal space]{.underline}.
Unger reminds us that the way institutions are arranged will either
mutilate or provide space for the emancipation of our being.85 For those
of us with privilege, we must use those privileges we cannot reject to
better understand, expose, and destabilize the structures and cultural
norms that support and reinscribe whiteness. [[We must raise the cost of
maintaining whiteness by seeking strategic interventions]{.mark} that
reduce racialized disparities across multiple areas, [but still seek to
better understand and problematize whiteness. We must]{.mark} begin to
[work for a new set of arrangements]{.mark} that will support a new way
of relating, [a new way of being]{.mark}.]{.underline} So, part of this
answer is in the material world, the arrangements of structures and
institutions---not only because we need to address material needs and
disparities, but because structures are not separate from our self. But
[we must keep an eye on the self that we are trying to call into being.
[Without working on the interiorization of whiteness, we simply cannot
solve the problem of whiteness]{.mark}.]{.underline} There has been some
development in this region, but I believe that the ontological question
of whiteness remains largely undertheorized.86 [The purpose of this
understanding is to end the performance of whiteness, not so that whites
can be non-white or uncolored people, but so we can all be human with
all our social amalgamation and complexity that has so long been denied
and dreaded.]{.underline} Feminist theory has developed a view of the
self as radically relational. It is this relational self that whiteness
is created in, but fearful to acknowledge. How can we create communities
of kinship that allow us to explore these connections?

#### Interrogation of power is not enough. We must engage in debates on how best to operationalize change to become effective advocates. If we win any risk of ground offense they can't win any education claims

Donald S **[Lutz]{.underline}**, **2k** (Political Theory and Partisan
Politics, pg 36-7)

The position argued here is that [to the extent such a discussion
between political theorists and politicians does not take place we
damage the prospects for marrying justice with power. Since the hope of
uniting justice with power was the reason for creating political
philosophy in the first place, political [theorists need to pursue the
dialogue as part of what justifies their]{.mark} intellectual [project.
Politics is the realm of power.]{.mark}]{.underline} More specifically,
[[i]{.mark}t is the realm [where force and violence are replaced by
debates and discussion]{.mark} about how to implement power.
[Without]{.mark} the [meaningful injection]{.mark} of considerations [of
justice, politics]{.mark} tends to [become discourse by the most
powerful about]{.mark} how to implement [their preferred
regime]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Although constitutionalism tends
to be disparaged by contemporary political science, [a constitution is
the very place where justice and power are married.]{.underline}
Aristotle first taught us that a constitution must be matched to the
realities of the political system -- the character, hopes, fears, needs
and environment of the people -- which requires that constitutionalism
be addressed by men and women practiced in the art of the possible.
Aristotle also taught us that [a constitution]{.underline} the
*politeia*, or plan for a way of life [should address [the improvement
of people]{.mark} toward the best life possible which [requires]{.mark}
[that constitutionalism be addressed by]{.mark} political [theorists who
can hold out a vision]{.mark} of justice [and the means for
advancing]{.mark} toward it. The]{.underline} conversation between
politician and political theorist stands at the center of their
respective callings, and a constitution, even though it reflects only a
part of the reality of a political system, has a special status in this
central conversion. Although the focus of this chapter is on a direct
conversation between theorist and politician, there is an important,
indirect aspect of the conversation that should not be overlooked --
classroom teaching. [[Too often the conversation]{.mark} between
politician and political theorist [is described]{.mark} in terms of a
direct one [between philosophers and those holding power. Overlooked is
the central need to educate as many]{.mark} young people [as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Since it is difficult to predict
who will, in fact, hold power, and because [the various peoples who take
seriously the marriage of justice with power are overwhelmingly
committed to a non-elitist, broad involvement of the
population,]{.underline} [we should not overlook or minimize our
importance as teachers of the many.]{.underline} Political leaders drawn
from a people who do not understand what is at stake are neither
inclined nor equipped to join the conversation. As we teach, we converse
with future leaders. Perhaps not everyone who teaches political theory
has had the same experience, but of the more than eight thousand
students I have taught, I know of at least forty nine who later held a
major elective office, and a least eighty more who have become important
political activists. This comes down to about five students per teaching
year , and I could not have predicted which five it would be. The
indeterminate future of any given student is one argument against
directing our efforts at civic education forward the few, best students.
[[A constitutional perspective suggests not only that those in power
rely upon support and direction from]{.mark} a broad segment of [the
public, but also]{.mark} [that reliance upon the successful civic
education of the elite is not]{.mark} very [effective, by itself for
marrying justice with power]{.mark} in the long run]{.underline}

#### Close enough does not count in the context of the resolution. Black participation is uniquely key in nuclear debates

**[[Black Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [[**comprehend that
peace is** not **the** absence of conflict**. As long as institutional
racism, apartheid, and social class inequality exist, social tensions
will erupt** ]{.mark}**into confrontations. Most blacks recognize that
[peace is the realization of social justice]{.mark} and human dignity
for all nations and historically oppressed peoples. Peace more than
anything else is the recognition of the oneness of
humanity.**]{.underline} As Paul Robeson, the great black artist and
activist, observed in his autobiographical work Here I Stand, \"I
learned that the essential character of a nation is determined not by
the tipper classes, but by the common people, and that the Common people
of all nations are truly brothers in the great family of mankind.\" Any
people who experience generations of oppression gain an awareness of the
innate commonalty of all human beings, despite their religions, ethnic,
and political differences. [**In order to reverse the logic of the Cold
War, white Americans must begin to view themselves as a distinct
minority ill a world dominated by people of color. [Peace between the
superpowers is ]{.mark}**directly **[linked to the evolution of
democratic rights, economic development, and social
justice]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the third world periphery. **[[Black
intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, front W. E. B. Du Bois to the
present, [[**have also comprehended their** unique role]{.mark} **in the
struggle for peace arid social justice. Cultural and intellectual
activity for its is inseparable from politics. All art and aesthetics,
scientific inquiry, and social studies are directly or indirectly linked
to the material conditions of human beings, and the existing set of
power relationships which dictates the policies of the modern state.**
[When intellectual artists fail to combat racial or gender
inequality,]{.mark}]{.underline} or the virus of anti-Semitism, [[their
creative energies may indirectly contribute to the ideological
justification]{.mark} for prejudice and social oppression. **This is
equally the case for the problem of war and peace. Through the**
bifurcation of our moral **and social** consciences against the cold
abstractions of research **and \"value-free\" social science, [we may
console ourselves by suggesting that we play role in the
]{.mark}**[escalation **of the** Cold War political culture**. By**
hesitating to dedicate ourselves ]{.mark}]{.underline}and our work
[**[to the pursuit of]{.mark} peace and** [social justice, we inevitably
contribute to the dynamics of national chauvinism, Militarism, and
perhaps set the ideological basis necessary for World War
III.]{.mark}]{.underline} Paul **[Robeson, during the Spanish Civil War,
expressed the perspective of the black Peace tradition as a passionate
belief in humanity: [\"Every artist, every scientist must decide, now,
where ]{.mark}]{.underline}**~~he~~ [**[\[they\] stand]{.mark}s[, life
has ]{.mark}**[no alternative. **There are no impartial
observers.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The commitment to contest public
dogmas, the recognition that we share with the Soviet people a Community
of social, economic, and cultural interests, force the intellectual into
the terrain of ideological debate. **[[If we fail to do so,]{.mark} and
if the peace consensus of black America remains isolated from
the]{.underline}** electoral [**mainstream[, the results may be the
]{.mark}**[termination of humanity itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### This education is the best way to rupture systems of power. Revolutions must be trained to infiltration institutions of power. This is the ONLY possible strategy in a world on face of the slow genocide of people of color

**Williams 1970 \[Robert F., civil rights leader, promoter of self
defense, interviewed by The Black Scholar, "Interviews," The Black
Scholar Volume 1 Number 7\]** 

**Williams: [[It is erroneous to think that one can isolate oneself
completely from institutions]{.mark} of a social and political system
that exercises power over the environment in which he resides.
[Self-imposed]{.mark} and premature [isolation]{.mark}, initiated by the
oppressed against the organs of a tyrannical establishment, [militates
against revolutionary movements dedicated to radical change. It is a
grave error]{.mark} for militant and just minded youth to reject
struggle-serving opportunities to join the]{.underline}** ~~man\'s~~
**[\[humanity's\] government and the services, police forces, peace
corps and vital organs of the power structure. [Militants should become
acquainted with the methods of the oppressor. Meaningful change can be
more thoroughly effectuated by militant pressure from
within]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as without. [[We can obtain valuable
know-how from the oppressor]{.underline}]{.mark}. Struggle is not all
violence. Effective struggle requires tactics, plans, analysis and a
highly sophisticated application of mental aptness. The forces of
oppression and tyranny have perfected highly articulate systems of
infiltration for undermining and frustrating the efforts of the
oppressed in trying to upset the unjust status quo. To a great extent,
the power structure keeps itself informed as to the revolutionary
activity of freedom fighters. [With the looming threat of extermination
looming menacingly before]{.underline} [black Americans, [it is
pressingly imperative that our people enter the vital organs of the
establishment]{.mark}. Infiltrate the]{.underline}** ~~man\'s~~

[At the turn of the twenty-first century, [Laclau entered into a
critical discussion with]{.mark} cultural theorist Judith [Butler
and]{.mark} Slovenian psychoanalyst and theorist Slavoj [Žižek]{.mark}
in their collaborative Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary
Dialogues in the Left. Using the theoretical lenses provided by Gramsci,
Derrida, and Lacan, [the three debate the failure of the Left in
contemporary politics]{.mark} and, if there has indeed been a failure,
its causes. The major contribution of this work to the field of
democratic theory is the ways the authors problematize current
watchwords deployed in the cultural rhetoric of US democracy such as
"multicultural," "pluralistic," and "politically correct."
[Ultimately,]{.mark} however[, the theorists of]{.mark} so-called
[radical democracy tend to become bogged down in discussions of the
discursivity of democracy; what they neglect]{.mark} here [is the
material, economic realities of poor people of color]{.mark} in the US
and around the globe. Kalyan K. Sanyal elaborates on this critique in
his "Postmarxism and the Third World: A Critical Response to the Radical
Democratic Agenda." "By emphasizing the discourse of the right," he
argues, the radical democrats link their multiple struggles to the state
because it is the state that endows every citizen with right, and the
process of realization of the right must refer to the state rather than
to any other form of collectivity . . . \[but\] what are the
implications of the radical democratic agenda for the global order,
economic and political? (128) In the end Sanyal finds that [the
implications are devastating]{.mark}. The most salient is that the
"Third World" "has to bear a large part of the cost of accommodating
rights in the \[First World\]. To the extent that these rights impinge
on the logic of profit and accumulation, capital has a tendency to move
to greener pastures in the Third World where such rights hardly exist"
(128). In fact, [the rhetoric of democracy in the US has grown out of a
Eurocentric obsession with "Western" foundations which inspire and
perpetuate an obsessive possessive individualism]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} constant appeals to [Enlightenment era thinking and
ideals.]{.mark} [The deployment]{.mark} of such rhetoric [has long
obscured the problems of racism, poverty, patriarchal oppression, and
heterosexism within the US, and now,]{.mark} given the global expansion
of US domination under the logic of late capitalism, [that same
rhetoric]{.mark} of democracy [obfuscates the historical and material
realities of]{.mark} US [colonialism and imperialism]{.mark} around the
world. [Debates about individual "rights" and appropriate "procedures"
rage on]{.mark} in the US [while suffering rages on in poor
neighborhoods populated disproportionately by people of color]{.mark} in
the US and enrages the devastated Two-Thirds World. It is a travesty
that demands a sustained intervention, one that historicizes
thepolitical and economic dimensions of the rhetoric of democracy in the
US.]{.underline}

#### They cannot solve systems of inequality unless we have a political framework contextualizing change through institutions. We must ignore the false choice between revolution and piecemeal reform. The alternative is political isolation creating a hopelessness that is the worst enemy of the oppressed

**Wood 2k** (Mark David Wood- MARK david wood is an assistant professor
jointly appointed in religious studies and African American studies at
Virginia Commonwealth University - \"Cornel West and the politics of
prophetic pragmatism\", p.88 90)

In subsequent publications, however, **[West did not pursue the working
class, internationalist, anticapitalist, anti-imperialist revolutionary
socialist theory and politics he elaborated and argued for in his
pre-Evasion works.]{.underline}** Between the publication of Prophesy
Deliverance and Race Matters in 1993, **[[West
developed]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and has continued to develop) **[[a
progressive pragmatist theory and politics.]{.mark} Rather than continue
to develop the radical project bequeathed to him by
M]{.underline}**artin **[L]{.underline}**uther **[K]{.underline}**ing
Ir. **[and Malcolm]{.underline}** X,[West]{.mark} **[[has followed a
post-Marxist path]{.mark} of theoretical and political
development]{.underline}**. **[Following this path
[involved]{.mark}]{.underline}**, above all else, **[[marginalizing
and]{.mark} in some cases [jettisoning the Marxist theory of class,
class struggle, and socialist transformation.]{.mark} Although many
academicians made race, class, and gender their conceptual
scaffolding,]{.underline}** class realities (e.g.,
[**[exploitation)]{.underline}** **[received the least attention, and
sometimes none at all]{.underline}**]{.mark} (see Wood 1986; Eagleton
1996). **[[Academicians theorized]{.mark} racism, ethnocentrism,
nationalism, sexism. and heterosexism as being fundamentally the
consequence of ideological and institutional forces]{.underline}**
(e.g., racist discourses and the legal system, respectively) but not of
capitalist property relations. **[[They]{.mark} thus [proposed
ending]{.mark} these [oppressive phenomena by transforming ideologies
and institutions, not by transforming the system]{.mark} of property
relations that these super structural forces regulate and
reproduce.]{.underline}** So, for example, West contends in Race Matters
that **[[the "major enemy of black]{.mark} [survival in America has
been]{.mark} and is neither oppression nor exploitation but rather [the
nihilistic threat-]{.mark}that is, [the loss of hope and absence of
meaning"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (1993:15). This problem can be "tamed
\[only\] by love and care," that is, by "a politics of conversion,\" by
"a turning of one's soul \[and\] one's own affirmation of one's own
worth-an affirmation fueled by concern for others" (18, 19).'
Alliteratively, in The War against Parents, he and Hewlett argue that
CEO greed, not private ownership of the means of production and global
competition for profits, is the fundamental cause of inequalities
(Hewlett and West 1998:6\\, 87). Having rejected the Marxist analysis he
advanced in Prophesy Deliverance and Prophetic Fragments,
**[[West]{.mark} no longer seeks to replace private with public control
of "the major institutions that regulate \|workers\'\] lives\"; rather,
he now [wants to ensure that "the grid of class, gender, and race weigh
less heavily upon our life in common\" and to increase "the ability of
the determined individual to climb the ladder ]{.mark}]{.underline}**of
class distinctions" (West 1982I1l4; Unger and West 1998:6o, 2.4).
indeed, the contrast between the theory and politics of his pre-Evasion
works and those of his post-Evasion writings could not be more striking.
As West writes in Race Matters, his post-Marxist politics seeks not to
build an international movement against corporate-controlled
globalization but to save America from racial division, moral
dissolution, and political balkanization and to establish "a freer, more
efficient, and stable America" (1993a:7). Rather than argue for
developing a counter hegemonic working class movement to turn back the
business-class assault, Hewlett and West urge us to empower heterosexual
parents to raise their children well so as to "increase America's store
of human capital and help this nation compete with the Germans and
Koreans" (1998:93). Rather than propose revolutionizing a system that
West previously described as "anti-democratic to the core," he and Unger
argue that our overarching goal should be "to democratize the American
economy and reenergize American democracy\" (1998:93). Not only has West
come to accept private property-\"the market\" and "free enterprise"-as
an inevitable fact of life, but **[he argues [explicitly against what
he]{.mark} now [calls the "paralyzing" belief, recommended by European
theories]{.mark} like Marxism, in the existence of a system outtier
"capitalism."]{.underline}** for example-with its driving laws, its
inner logic, and its indivisible unity. **[[Either you change the whole
system, or you]{.mark} merely [try to soften its]{.mark} harsh [effects
through "reformism.\" This]{.mark} simple and sincere progressive [fails
to cross the threshold of questioning and reimagining]{.mark} American
institutions, [or crosses it only under pressure of extreme
crisis]{.mark} and with the help of the collective anxieties and
enthusiasms crisis generates. [The believer in the idea of the "system"
places the institutional arrangements of the country beyond effective
reach of deliberate, piecemeal reconstruction.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Unger and West 1998-9-30). West is certainly a long way from his
earlier claims that Marxism is essential to liberation in that it
clarifies in "an extremely clear and convincing way\" the causes of
racism and what must be done to fight capitalist imperialism and to
build a genuinely humane, free, and democratic society. **[[A
progressivism that incorporates "the truth about political
possibility,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** as West indicates his now does.
**[[rejects "the]{.mark} simple [contrast between governmental activism
and free enterprise,]{.mark} not because it wants to have a little of
each, but [because it insists upon having more of
both\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Unger and West 199857, 3). Unlike those
who believe in a capitalist system "out there," **[[prophetic
pragmatists]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as members of a large progressive
coalition, do not assume \"primacy for one causal factor," such as
property relations, and are not committed to "any preordained historical
agent, such as the working class" (West 1989: 2.35). Rather, they take
the high road and "condemn oppression anywhere and everywhere,"
**[[promote "]{.mark}an all-embracing [democratic and libertarian moral
vision,]{.mark}"]{.underline}** and "invite all people of goodwill both
here and abroad to fight for an Emersonian culture of creative
democracy\" in order, **[[ultimately to "alleviate the plight of the
wretched of the earth"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (135, 231, 235). Whereas
the aim of West's African American revolutionary Christianity was to
build a socio-economic system based on "collective control of major
institutions," the aim of his prophetic pragmatism is to "revitalize our
republic" and "democratize the market economy" (West t98z:n4; Hewlett
and West 1998:258; Unger and West 1998:49). **[[The goal is]{.mark} no
longer to develop "a revolutionary praxis beyond capitalist
civilization" but rather [to improve conditions of labor, lei-sure, and
life within the limits]{.mark}]{.underline}** of capitalist property
relations. Interestingly **[[following West's earlier]{.mark} Marxist
[analyses, which he]{.mark} now views as being [based on a
"]{.mark}paralyzing[\" belief in a reified system, nothing could be more
utopian.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Switch side debate requires you to affirm the resolution. Fluidity is the strategy of whiteness, able to mold and shape itself to avoid being identified and to remain invisible. Switch side debate is blackness -- Conviction based debate is whiteness.

I agree with this argument. However, you have no warrant to support the
claim that SSD prevents the pursuit of social justice. [SSD best
facilitates social justice.]{.underline} You have already dropped [my
argument that it protects negative ground and that [protecting negative
ground is essential to promoting social justice in
debate]{.mark}.]{.underline} You also dropped my argument that
[[allowing debaters to go rogue because of their "personal convictions"
may mean that we never discuss issues pertaining to social justice
because debaters may choose to avoid those issues all together]{.mark}.
In short, "[conviction based debate" ("CBD") is neither necessary nor
sufficient to produce social justice]{.mark}.]{.underline} You lose this
argument. CH says: Rashad has presented a defense of a "Black SSD" which
allows individuals to "\[engaged\] the resolution from \[their\]
specific social location". This modification to the traditional practice
of SSD, he claims, exposes debates to a broad range of topics,
encourages reflexivity, forces students to "check their privilege", and
offers creative takes on the topic, all while preserving the
"instrumental goal" of topic-based fairness in debate. However, none of
the purported benefits \*justify\* SSD. Rashad has to thread the needle:
First, you dropped my pre-empt to this argument. [SSD is Blackness; CBD
is whiteness.]{.underline} Therefore, [[Black SSD is not a modification
but instead a clarification]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Your ghetoization of
debate that is engaging as opposed to dismissive highlights the problems
with CBD and is my first voting issue in this debate.]{.underline}
[Encouraging debaters to engage the resolution from their social
location is not a Black thing; it's just a thing.]{.underline} **[[It
recognizes that white people have a social location as well and that
they must begin to situate themselves as merely part of the picture and
not the whole picture]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words[,
[SSD]{.mark}]{.underline} or Black SSD as you call it[, [forces you to
realize that your view comes from somewhere and is not just a view from
nowhere]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Lastly, this argument was
gay turned in the 1NC. [SSD requires debaters to speak on issues they
may not otherwise consider.]{.underline} [In an increasingly diverse
debate community with increased Black participation in particular, SSD
takes on an even more significant meaning as it is a unique opportunity
to incorporate Black thought into debate and policy making. This
incorporation solves the fundamental problem with all debate: it's too
white, too male and too straight. Again, debate infused by Black and
queer thought is the solution to the ills you identify.]{.underline}
Your argument has been turned.

**[[In an aesthetic]{.mark} rather than political [register]{.mark},
[theory articulates dissidence and compliance]{.mark}
simultaneously.]{.underline}** At least one reason why this precarious
balance can be maintained is found in the prevailing conditions of the
postwar United States in which a fissure has opened up between the site
of contestation embodied by the law and unwritten directives governing
acceptable dissent. **[[We have all grown
accustomed,]{.underline}]{.mark}** for example, **[[to the assumption
that the U.S. Constitution protects citizens against
discrimination]{.mark} on the basis of "race, color, and
creed.\"]{.underline}** [**[In fact]{.underline}**,]{.mark} unlike the
UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, **[[there are no explicit
protections]{.mark} for freedom of conscience in the U.S.]{.underline}**
Constitution apart from article 1, which protects against "prohibiting
the free exercise of religion.\" This has resulted in a series of
negative pressures on North American intellectual life. While free
speech in the abstract is protected by law, the safeguards never specify
the content of acceptable speech, leaving all with the (false)
impression that no restrictions are tolerated. Such abstraction does not
render free speech meaningless, but it hides its partial character.
Freedom of expression is, in this respect, fatally abstract and for that
reason severely restricted without being meaningless. One clear
institutional exercise of free expression has been the policy of
affirmative action, which attempts to allow doing to take place freely,
to not be foreclosed by a certain perception of being. On the other
hand, affirmative action relies on a shift from identity-as-position to
identity-as-location. So, many still stubbornly assume, for example,
that American-based scholars whose family background is Lebanese,
Nigerian, or Mexican are born specialists on Lebanon, Nigeria, or
Mexico. Entire careers, not just the speakers' lists of conferences or
magazine roundtables, operate with a brittle confidence in this
questionable homology between knowledge and being, analytical depth and
sumame. **[[A cellular epistemology has]{.mark} for several decades
[covered the thinking and]{.mark} (more important) the [policymaking of
academic reformers and liberal politicians ]{.mark}]{.underline}**as
well as that of public commentators and mainstream news
organizations[,]{.mark} **[thereby [opening itself up to a reactionary
attack that has won favor with]{.mark} sectors of [the
public.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In spite of the crucial points of
dissonance between the media and academic progressives on matters
ranging from the value of cultural studies to the role of research in
undergraduate humanities education, there is no disagreement about the
subtle equation between black scholars and black thinking, if one can
use such a term. I use it here, at any rate, with intentional irony to
refer to that nervous overcompensation by well-intended administrators
who still actually believe in what they pretend not to: namely, the
radical and essential differences among people on the grounds of race,
gender, and ethnicity. **[In this liberal sentiment [there circulates an
amalgam of]{.mark} similarly [harmful but widespread assumptions by
the]{.mark} very [people at the cutting edge, supposedly, of curricular
reform, affirmative action, and postcolonial
sympathy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Such assumptions include the centrality
of the English language in a world where only a global minority speaks
it, about the vibrancy and longevity of foreign popular cultures
provided they are already subsumed into the U.S. media and are therefore
translatable, or about the seductions of the European literary canon-a
position that must ignore the competitive aesthetic brilliance of, say,
Caribbean music when placed alongside European literature or, indeed,
Urdu literature when juxtaposed with its European counterparts. **[In
both media and academic venues, [the defense of culturally dissonant
thinking is given permission to be only in the imaginary form of the
nonwhite, the woman, or the diasporic scholar.]{.mark} Very much like
the Californian tourist in Mali, the liberal critic cannot wait to
return home to a more secure and inviting environment.]{.underline}**
Beliefs breed ways of being, and the intolerance toward some has less to
do with scholarly refutations than with a palpable unease in the
presence of lifestyles and worldviews that demand of the stranger a
painful, and often impossible, cultural conversion. **[Outside the
relative social fairness and moral conscience of the university, [the
key sites of opinion forming and decision making]{.mark}-Congress. the

exemplified, perhaps, by the wave of arson against Southern black
churches in the late 1990's, or the Post 9/11 government campaign

regarding the fate of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli troops and
settlers[.]{.mark} Such campaigns and policy changes are not being
enacted, however, without resistance, for the crucial reason that a firm
rhetoric of racial and gender inclusions still remains a part of U.S.
civic life. **[[People still widely agree that genocide and racism are

\*we do not endorse ableist language

They are the enemies of democracy and are crucial in creating
subjectivities and values that buy into the notion that capital rather
than people are the subject of history and that consuming is the only
obligation of citizenship. Their goal is to normalize the ideologies,
modes of governance and policies that reproduce massive inequities and
suffering for the many, and exorbitant and dangerous privileges for the
corporate and financial elite. Moreover, such intellectuals are
symptomic of the fact that **[neoliberalism represents a new historical
conjuncture in which cultural institutions and political power have
taken on a whole new life in shaping politics]{.underline}**. What this
suggests is that the left in its various registers has to create its own
public intellectuals in higher education, the alternative media and all
of those spaces where meaning circulates. **[[Intellectuals have a
responsibility to connect their work to]{.mark} important [social
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**, work with popular movements **[[and
engage in the shaping of policies]{.mark} that benefit all people and
not simply a few]{.underline}**. At the heart of this suggestion is the
need to recognize that ideas matter in the battle against
authoritarianism and that pedagogy must be central to any viable notion
of politics and collective struggle. **[Public intellectuals have [an
obligation to work for global peace, individual freedom]{.mark}, care of
others, economic justice and democratic participation]{.underline}**,
especially at a time of legitimized violence and tyranny. I completely
agree with the late Pierre Bourdieu when he insisted that there is
enormous political importance \"to defend the possibility and necessity
of the intellectual, who is firstly critical of the existing state of
affairs. There is no genuine democracy without genuine opposing critical
power.\" The very notion of being an engaged public intellectual is
neither foreign to nor a violation of what it means to be an academic
scholar, but central to its very definition. Put simply, **[academics
have a duty to enter into the public sphere unafraid to take positions
and generate controversy]{.underline}**, functioning as moral witnesses,
raising political awareness and **[making connections to those elements
of power and politics often hidden from public view]{.underline}**. One
final question. Are you optimistic about the future of the left and of
progressive politics in general? It is impossible to be on the left and
at the same time surrender to the normalization of a dystopian vision[.
**[One has to be optimistic, but also realistic]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[This means that [there is no room for]{.mark} a kind of [romanticized
utopianism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, **[one has to be motivated
by a faith in the willingness]{.underline}** of young people principally
**[to fight for a future in which dignity, equality and justice matter
and]{.underline}** at the same time **[recognize the forces that are
preventing such a struggle]{.underline}**. More specifically, [**[hope
has to be fed by the need for collective action]{.underline}**. **[Power
is never completely on the side of domination and resistance is not a
luxury but a necessity]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As Stanley Aronowitz has
argued **[[the left has to]{.underline}]{.mark}** engage the issue of
economic inequality, overcome its fragmentation, develop an
international social formation for radical democracy and the defense of
the public good, undertake ways to finance itself, take seriously the
educative nature of politics and the need to change the way people
think, and [**[develop a comprehensive notion of politics and a vision
to match]{.underline}**.]{.mark} History is open, though the gates are
closing fast. The issue for me personally is not whether I am
pessimistic, but how am I going to use whatever intellectual resources I
have to make it harder to prevent various events and problems from
getting worse while at the same time struggling for a society in which
the promise of democracy appears on the horizon of possibility.

#### Charity Cannibalism DA: The West sustains itself through the cannibalization of the misery of those in the Global South, turning it in;pl to a field for the mass production of violence until the point of the west's total collapse

**Baudrillard 94** (Jean Baudrillard, greatest living philosopher, 1994,
*The Illusion of the End*, pg. 66-70)

The end of history, being itself a catastrophe, can only be fuelled by
catastrophe. Managing the end therefore becomes synonymous with the
management of catastrophe. And, quite specifically, of that catastrophe
which is the slow extermination of the rest of the world. [We have long
denounced the capitalistic, economic exploitation of the poverty of the
\'other half of the world\']{.underline} \[l\'autre monde\]. [We must
today denounce the moral and sentimental exploitation of that poverty -
charity cannibalism being worse than oppressive violence. The extraction
and humanitarian reprocessing of a destitution which has become the
equivalent of oil deposits and gold mines.]{.underline} The extortion of
the spectacle of poverty and, at the same time, of our charitable
condescension: a worldwide appreciated surplus of fine sentiments and
bad conscience. We should, in fact, see this not as the extraction of
raw materials, but as a waste-reprocessing enterprise. [Their
destitution and our bad conscience are, in effect, all part of the
waste-products of history - the main thing is to recycle them to produce
a new energy source.]{.underline} We have here an escalation in the
psychological balance of terror. [World capitalist oppression is now
merely the vehicle and alibi for this other, much more ferocious, form
of moral predation.]{.underline} One might almost say, contrary to the
Marxist analysis, that [material exploitation is only there to extract
that spiritual raw material that is the misery of peoples, which serves
as psychological nourishment for the rich countries and media
nourishment for our daily lives.]{.underline} The \'Fourth World\' (we
are no longer dealing with a \'developing\' Third World) is once again
beleaguered, this time as a catastrophe-bearing stratum. The West is
whitewashed in the reprocessing of the rest of the world as waste and
residue. [And the white world repents and seeks absolution - it, too,
the waste-product of its own history. The South is a natural producer of
raw materials, the latest of which is catastrophe. The North, for its
part, specializes in the reprocessing of raw materials and hence also in
the reprocessing of catastrophe. Bloodsucking protection, humanitarian
interference, Medecins sans frontieres, international
solidarity,]{.underline} etc. The last phase of colonialism: [the New
Sentimental Order is merely the latest form of the New World Order.
Other people\'s destitution becomes our adventure
playground.]{.underline} Thus, [the humanitarian offensive aimed at the
Kurds - a show of repentance on the part of the Western powers after
allowing Saddam Hussein to crush them - is in reality merely the second
phase of the war, a phase in which charitable intervention finishes off
the work of extermination. We are the consumers of the ever delightful
spectacle of poverty and catastrophe, and of the moving spectacle of our
own efforts to alleviate it (which, in fact, merely function to secure
the conditions of reproduction of the catastrophe market);]{.underline}
there, at least, in the order of moral profits, the Marxist analysis is
wholly applicable: we see to it that [extreme poverty is reproduced as a
symbolic deposit, as a fuel essential to the moral and sentimental
equilibrium of the West.]{.underline} In our defence, it might be said
that this extreme poverty was largely of our own making and it is
therefore normal that we should profit by it. There can be no finer
proof that the distress of the rest of the world is at the root of
Western power and that the spectacle of that distress is its crowning
glory than the inauguration, on the roof of the Arche de la Defense,
with a sumptuous buffet laid on by the Fondation des Droits de l\'homme,
of an exhibition of the finest photos of world poverty. Should we be
surprised that spaces are set aside in the Arche d\'Alliance\* for
universal suffering hallowed by caviar and champagne? Just as the
economic crisis of the West will not be complete so long as it can still
exploit the resources of the rest of the world, so [the symbolic crisis
will be complete only when it is no longer able to feed on the other
half\'s human and natural catastrophes (Eastern Europe, the Gulf, the
Kurds, Bangladesh, etc.). We need this drug, which serves us as an
aphrodisiac and hallucinogen. And the poor countries are the best
suppliers - as, indeed, they are of other drugs. We provide them,
through our media, with the means to exploit this paradoxical resource,
just as we give them the means to exhaust their natural resources with
our technologies. Our whole culture lives off this catastrophic
cannibalism, relayed in cynical mode by the news media, and carried
forward in moral mode by our humanitarian aid, which is a way of
encouraging it and ensuring its continuity, just as economic aid is a
strategy for perpetuating under-development.]{.underline} Up to now, the
financial sacrifice has been compensated a hundredfold by the moral
gain; But when the catastrophe market itself reaches crisis point, in
accordance with the implacable logic of the market, [when distress
becomes scarce or the marginal returns on it fall from overexploitation,
when we run out of disasters from elsewhere or when they can no longer
be traded like coffee or other commodities, the West will be forced to
produce its own catastrophe for itself, in order to meet its need for
spectacle and that voracious appetite for symbols which characterizes it
even more than its voracious appetite for food. It will reach the point
where it devours itself.]{.underline} When we have finished sucking out
the destiny of others, we shall have to invent one for ourselves. The
Great Crash, the symbolic crash, will come in the end from us
Westerners, but only when we are no longer able to feed on the
hallucinogenic misery which comes to us from the other half of the
world. Yet they do not seem keen to give up their monopoly. The Middle
East, Bangladesh, black Africa and Latin America are really going flat
out in the distress and catastrophe stakes, and thus in providing
symbolic nourishment for the rich world. They might be said to be
overdoing it: heaping earthquakes, floods, famines and ecological
disasters one upon another, and finding the means to massacre each other
most of the time. The \'disaster show\' goes on without any let-up and
our sacrificial debt to them far exceeds their economic debt. The misery
with which they generously overwhelm us is something we shall never be
able to repay. [The sacrifices we offer in return are laughable (a
tornado or two, a few tiny holocausts on the roads, the odd financial
sacrifice) and, moreover, by some infernal logic, these work out as much
greater gains for us]{.underline}, whereas our kindnesses have merely
added to the natural catastrophes another one immeasurably worse: the
demographic catastrophe, a veritable epidemic which we deplore each day
in pictures. In short, there is such distortion between North and South,
to the symbolic advantage of the South (a hundred thousand Iraqi dead
against casualties numbered in tens on our side: in every case we are
the losers), that one day everything will break down. One day, the West
will break down if we are not soon washed clean of this shame, if an
international congress of the poor countries does not very quickly
decide to share out this symbolic privilege of misery and catastrophe.
It is of course normal, since we refuse to allow the spread of nuclear
weapons, that they should refuse to allow the spread of the catastrophe
weapon. But it is not right that they should exert that monopoly
indefinitely. In any case, [the under-developed are only so by
comparison with the Western system and its presumed success. In the
light of its assumed failure, they are not under-developed at all. They
are only so in terms of a dominant evolutionism which has always been
the worst of colonial ideologies.]{.underline} The argument here is that
there is a line of objective progress and everyone is supposed to pass
through its various stages (we find the same eyewash with regard to the
evolution of species and in that evolutionism which unilaterally
sanctions the superiority of the human race). [In the light of current
upheavals, which put an end to any idea of history as a linear process,
there are no longer either developed or under-developed peoples. Thus,
to encourage hope of evolution - albeit by revolution - among the poor
and to doom them, in keeping with the objective illusion of progress, to
technological salvation is a criminal absurdity.]{.underline} In actual
fact, it is their good fortune to be able to escape from evolution just
at the point when we no longer know where it is leading. In any case, a
majority of these peoples, including those of Eastern Europe, do not
seem keen to enter this evolutionist modernity, and their weight in the
balance is certainly no small factor in the West\'s repudiation of its
own history, of its own utopias and its own modernity. It might be said
that the routes of violence, historical or otherwise, are ·being turned
around and that the viruses now pass from South to North, there being
every chance that, five hundred years after America was conquered, 1992
and the end of the century will mark the comeback of the defeated and
the sudden reversal of that modernity. The sense of pride is no longer
on the side of wealth but of poverty, of those who - fortunately for
them - have nothing to repent, and may indeed glory in being privileged
in terms of catastrophes. Admittedly, this is a privilege they could
hardly renounce, even if they wished to, but natural disasters merely
reinforce the sense of guilt felt towards them by the wealthy - by those
whom God visibly scorns since he no longer even strikes them down. One
day it will be the Whites themselves who will give up their whiteness.
It is a good bet that repentance will reach its highest pitch with the
five-hundredth anniversary of the conquest of the Americas. We are going
to have to lift the curse of the defeated - but symbolically
victorious - peoples, which is insinuating itself five hundred years
later, by way of repentance, into the heart of the white race.

#### Mourning requires the assimilation and cannibalism of the Other -- memory and mourning of the Other instrumentalize and incorporate the Other within the self. Instead, we should refuse to mourn the Other as a testament to absolute alterity. 

**Reynolds, 4** \[Jack, Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Tasmania, [Possible and Impossible, Self and Other, and the
Reversibility of Merleau-Ponty and
Derrida](https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-629611451/possible-and-impossible-self-and-other-and-the-reversibility),
Spring 2004, Philosophy Today, Vol. 48, No. 1\]

Moreover, in his essay \"Fors: The Anglish Words of Nicolas Abraham and
Maria Torok,\" **[[Derrida]{.underline}]{.mark}** again **[[considers
two models of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the type of **[[encroachment
between self and other]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is regularly
[**[associated with mourning]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Borrowing from
post-Freudian theories of mourning, he posits (although later
undermines) a difference between introjection, which is love for the
other person in me, and incorporation, which involves retaining the
other person as a pocket, or a foreign body within one\'s own body. For
Freud, as well as for the psychologists Abraham and Torok whose work
Derrida considers, **[successful [mourning is]{.mark} primarily [about
the introjection of the other person, and where they are consumed within
us]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The preservation of a discrete and
separate other inside the self, as is the case in incorporation, is
considered to be where mourning ceases to be a \"normal\" response and
instead becomes pathological. Typically, Derrida reverses this hierarchy
and order of Subordination by highlighting that there is a sense in
which the supposedly pathological condition of incorporation is actually
more respectful of the other\'s alterity. After all, incorporation means
that one has not totally assimilated or digested the other, as there is
still a difference and heterogeneity (EO 57). On the other hand, Abraham
and Torok\'s \"normal\" **[[mourning can be accused of interiorizing the
other to such a degree that they have become assimilated and
even]{.mark} metaphorically [cannibalized]{.mark}]{.underline}**.16
[**[Derrida considers this introjection to be an infidelity to the
other]{.underline}**,]{.mark} although it will be argued that this type
of mourning has more to recommend it than he allows. Indeed, it will be
shown that Merleau-Ponty\'s notion of responsibility towards alterity is
more \"digestive\" and appropriative, and it will also be argued that
this is not necessarily a bad thing. Before we get ahead of ourselves,
however, it is worth recognizing that Derrida\'s account is not so
simple as to unreservedly valorize the incorporation of the other, even
if **[[he consistently emphasizes this paradigm in an effort to refute
the canonical interpretation of successful
mourning]{.underline}]{.mark}**. he also acknowledges that the more the
self \"keeps the foreign element inside itself, the more it excludes
it\" (Fors xvii). Refusing to engage with the other, we exclude their
foreignness from ourselves and hence prevent any transformative
interaction with it. When fetishized in their externality in such a
manner, the dead other really is lifeless and it is significant that
Derrida describes the death of de Man in terms of the loss of exchange
and of the transformational opportunities that he presented (MDM xvi).17
Derrida\'s point hence seems to be that **[in mourning we must oscillate
between introjection and incorporation, but [the \"otherness of the
other\"]{.mark} nevertheless [resists both the process of incorporation
as well as the process of introjection. The other can neither be
preserved as a foreign entity, nor introjected fully
within]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, [**[the other must always resist
my memory and interiorization of them]{.underline}**, **[and remains
outside the grasp of subjectivity-that is, wholly
other]{.underline}**]{.mark} (tout autre). Towards the end of Memoires:
for Paul de Man, Derrida suggests that **[[responsibility towards
alterity is precisely about respecting and even emphasizing this
resistance of the other, as well as the concomitant impossibility of
mourning]{.underline}]{.mark}** (MDM 160, 238). It is on this point that
he parts company with Merleau-Ponty, and there are again two main
responses that Merleau-Ponty\'s work can help us furnish.

#### Blackness constitutes the site of a paradoxical double-bind within the social order -- it is both the organizing principle that makes possible the coherence of the world and the object of that world's gratuitous violence -- as such, the aff's wedding to affirmative potentiality accedes to a form of communicative capitalism which is only capable of modulatively reproducing the anti-black grammar of civil society

\[1\] **[[Anti-blackness operates axiomatically]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[This is the case]{.underline}, at least, [insofar as we speak of what
Frank B. Wilderson, III, has called \"[the world]{.mark}\"]{.underline}
(Wilderson 2003: 234).\[1\] {1. \"[World\" here [refers]{.mark} not to
reality as such, but more precisely [to the **paradigmatic operations by
which reality is structured**]{.mark}**, positioned, and rendered
sensible**]{.underline}. [Yet this does not mean that one can directly
express or pose reality as distinct from the world, for **the world
governs the very conditions of possibility for expression or
position**]{.underline}. [Even purportedly universal terms, such as
humanity, social life, and]{.underline}---to invoke the concern of this
essay---[being itself, are **operations of the world**]{.underline}.
[The Afro-Pessimist thesis, following Wilderson, is that **[this
world]{.mark} constitutes itself and [maintains its coherence]{.mark}**,
at essence, **[through anti-blackness]{.mark}**: **[the world has being
insofar as blackness does not]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Since the grammar
of this world, or the logic of the aforementioned operations, is so
**naturalized**]{.underline}---[enacted and assumed by/from
power]{.underline}---[that it generally has **no need to
appear**]{.underline} ([much less defend itself]{.underline}), [the
articulation of [reality without the anti-black world **must begin as an
articulation against this world**]{.mark}]{.underline}.} The aim of this
essay is to address the consequences of this axiomatic operation for
some rather classical terms of reference within continental philosophy,
such as being, analogy,\[2\] communication, possibility, and knowledge.
{2. Both the reading of Lazzarato I provide below and my general
argument, which revolves around the question of negativity and analogy,
are deeply shaped by---and only conceivable thanks to---the writings of
Wilderson, whose claim about analogy is summarized in the following
remark, made in conversation with Hartman: \"In my own work, obviously
[I\'m not saying that in this space of negation, which is blackness,
there is no life]{.underline}. [We have **tremendous
life**]{.underline}. [But this life is **not analogous to those
touchstones of cohesion that hold civil society together**]{.underline}.
In fact, [the trajectory of our life]{.underline} ([within our terrain
of **civil death**]{.underline}) [is bound up in
**claiming**]{.underline}---[sometimes individually, sometimes
collectively]{.underline}---**[[the violence]{.mark} which [Fanon writes
about]{.mark}]{.underline}** in *The Wretched of the Earth*, [that
trajectory which]{.underline}, as he says, [[is \'a **splinter to the
heart of the world\'**]{.mark} and **\'puts the settler out of the
picture**]{.underline}.\' [So, it doesn\'t help us politically or
psychologically to try to find ways in which how we live is analogous to
how white positionality lives, because]{.underline}, as I think your
book suggests, **[whites gain their coherence by knowing what they are
not]{.underline}**\" (Hartman and Wilderson 2003: 187).} [Such terms are
the means by which the world claims to **grant itself coherence**; they
form the **grammatical ground**, the **structuring condition**, of the
world]{.underline}. [If [the **\"gratuitous violence\"** of
anti-blackness **extends into**]{.mark} **the very [\"grammar\" of the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Wilderson 2010: 38, 131),\[3\] [then the
aforementioned terms]{.underline}---[far from providing retreat into a
\"metaphysical\" domain unaffected by the historical and
material]{.underline}---[serve as points for the articulation of
**antagonism toward anti-blackness**]{.underline}. In fact, [the
**gratuity** of such violence]{.underline}---[its **irreducibility to
purposive meaning**]{.underline}---[entails a **refusal of the coherent
ground** that these very terms claim to supply]{.underline}. This is to
say that [[being]{.underline}]{.mark}---[or the possibility
thereof]{.underline}---[[grounds itself **not through its own
coherence**, but through]{.mark} an **enactment of power that is staged
by [anti-black violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[Power precedes
grammatical ground]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

\[2\] Maurizio Lazzarato\'s analysis of contemporary capitalism
approaches the anti-blackness analyzed by Wilderson. Lazzarato argues
that capitalism is not grounded in any coherent science of economy, but
is an enactment of the power to make indebted beings. It is by way of
this emphasis on power that he links a purportedly secular capitalism to
the theological structure of Christianity---that is, to a being that
acts gratuitously, or without ground. Yet Lazzarato, I argue, ultimately
wards off an encounter with anti-blackness through reliance on a
coherence implicit in \"the indebted man\" (Lazzarato 2012: 8). I
elaborate this argument by drawing on [Gilles Deleuze\'s concept of
\"difference in itself\"]{.underline} (Deleuze 1994: 36-89). This
concept, on my reading, [ungrounds the purported coherence of being by
way of a logically prior differentiality, which is expressed as
**non-being**]{.underline}. [Essential to this argument is the task of
articulating such non-being **without conversion to an affirmation of
the world**]{.underline}.

Non-Being: Deleuze Against Affirmation

\[3\] [Deleuze\'s philosophy has come to be associated with habits of
affirmation, where \"habits\" indicate the practices or operations by
which reality is experientially and experimentally
enacted]{.underline}.\[4\] [This association could be attributed to
Deleuze\'s invocation of concepts such as the rhizome, which appears to
advocate teeming, emergent, multiplicitous movement in excess of all
boundaries]{.underline}. [In such a landscape of fluidity and flux,
Deleuze\'s notion of creation then becomes associated with the
affirmation of alternative possibilities]{.underline}. [This association
may also be attributed to Deleuze\'s rigorous refusal of the being of
negativity]{.underline}. [He contends that negative being plays no role
in the determination of reality, that it is in fact an illusion that
conceals the force of differential immanence]{.underline}. Given the
centrality of this contention, [any association of Deleuze\'s thought
with habits of affirmation would have to depend on the following claim:
the refusal of negative being entails the refusal of habits of
negativity, in favor of habits of affirmation]{.underline}.\[5\]

\[4\] [Yet [it is **fundamentally mistaken** to conflate]{.mark} the
refusal of [negative being with]{.mark} the refusal of [negative
habits]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The call for habits of affirmation is
theoretically illegitimate: if all habits are real, and if reality has
no negative being, then all habits]{.underline}---[precisely because
they are real]{.underline}---**[do not involve negative
being]{.underline}**; [the reality that is
habituated]{.underline}---[regardless of whether this habituation is
characterized as affirmative or negative]{.underline}---[has no negative
being]{.underline}. If the call for habits of affirmation is therefore
not entailed by Deleuze\'s refusal of negative being, then from where
does this call arise? [If habits of affirmation are imperative, then
from where does this imperativity draw its mandate?]{.underline} To
begin to answer these questions, one must address the ways in which
[[habits of affirmation are]{.mark} ***logically
consistent***]{.underline}---[and ultimately ***[politically
complicit]{.mark}***]{.underline}---[[with]{.mark} the **contemporary
conjuncture of [capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\[5\] [This conjuncture, which has been variously described in terms of
\"**late capitalism**,\" \"[**postfordism**,\" or \"**communicative
capitalism**]{.mark},\" [is marked by]{.mark} an affirmation of
**[mobility]{.mark}**, **innovation**, [**fluidity**, **possibility**,
and **creativity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Deleuze analyzed this
conjuncture in terms of **[control societies]{.mark}**, which he
distinguished from disciplinary societies]{.underline}. [Control
[establish]{.mark}es [domination]{.mark} **not by setting up in advance
strict boundaries**, but rather [by]{.mark} a kind of **unending
encouragement**, or **motivated permissiveness**: control establishes
and expands itself by **[establishing and expanding possibilities of
communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Domination \"no longer
operate\[s\] by confining people but through **continuous control** and
**instant communication**]{.underline}\" (Deleuze 1997: 174). [Whereas
discipline names the prohibition of excessive mobility and innovation,
control names the **\"modulation\" of the possibilities implied in such
mobility and innovation**]{.underline} (Deleuze 1997: 179).\[6\]

\[6\] [With control, [domination remains **not** ]{.mark}**despite, nor
[in opposition to, but]{.mark} precisely [*as* possibility]{.mark}**,
which is **modulated** through a **[communicability]{.mark}** that
[is]{.mark} **ever [more fluid]{.mark} and receptive** in its
[listening]{.mark} in order [to be]{.mark} **ever [more
innovative]{.mark} in its [surveilling]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[7\] {7.
[The fundamental **insidiousness of control** is that it **permits** and
**encourages** the **fluidity**, **mobility**, and **possibility**
implied by the **sheer *capacity* to narrate**]{.underline}.
[[Communicative capitalism]{.mark} does not work by mandating what can
and cannot be narrated, rather it [calls for
**any-narration**]{.mark}**-whatever, [as long as]{.mark} the
possibility of [narration *is* affirmed]{.mark}**]{.underline}.}
[Following Deleuze\'s analysis of control, habits of
affirmation]{.underline}---[of multiplicitous possibilities, or of the
possibility of being-otherwise]{.underline}---[are **not resistant to,
but actually constitutive of, control\'s modulation**]{.underline}.
[Control is marked by \"**endless postponement**\"]{.underline} (Deleuze
1997: 179), [meaning that the future]{.underline}---[as that which
breaks with the present]{.underline}---**[never takes
place]{.underline}**. [The present is extended into the future, and so
**the future becomes a modulation of the present**; an essential
incommensurability between present and future remains
**unthinkable**]{.underline}.\[8\] Given Deleuze\'s analysis, [it is not
by accident that he increasingly experimented with habits of
negativity]{.underline}. [In his last book]{.underline}, *What is
Philosophy?* -- co-written with Félix Guattari, and published one year
after his analysis of control---[one can observe, for instance, his
attentiveness to \"shame\"]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1996:
107), [which was motivated by his reading of Primo Levi, or his
indication of agreement with the negative dialectic of Theodor
Adorno]{.underline}.\[9\]

\[7\] [One finds, in the same book, a **polemic against communication**
and a concomitant positioning of **creation as distinct from and
incommensurable with the communicative**]{.underline}.\[10\] Simply put,
[Deleuze\'s increased attention to control, or communication, directly
corresponds to his increased attention to the
negative]{.underline}---[not as being but as experience and experiment,
as habit]{.underline}. [Thus it is not only that Deleuze\'s refusal of
negative being cannot be conflated with habits of affirmation, it is
also that [Deleuze]{.mark}, when attending to control, attempts to
articulate **habits of *negativity***]{.underline}. [*What is
Philosophy?* [concludes with]{.mark} an articulation of [**the *No* of
chaos**, **the *non* of thought** that **enables creation**]{.mark}:
philosophy must attain \"an **essential relationship with the No that
concerns it**\"; philosophy does \"not need the No as beginning, or as
the end in which \[it\] would be called upon to disappear by being
realized, but **at every moment of \[its\] becoming or \[its\]
development**]{.underline}\" (Deleuze and Guattari 1996: 218).

\[8\] [The creation named by Deleuze\'s philosophy is thus in
**immanence with the No**, and it is [this **No-creation
immanence**]{.mark} that [begins to]{.mark} [articulate **antagonism
toward communication**]{.mark}]{.underline}: \"[Creating has always been
something **different from communicating**]{.underline}\" (Deleuze 1997:
175). [[This **divergence**]{.mark} **between communication and the No
of creation** [is]{.mark} **utter**, **essential**, and
**[irredeemable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[There is **no**]{.mark}
**possibility of [emancipating communication]{.mark}, nor is there any
affirmative basis for creation**]{.underline}---[for the base is
communication]{.underline}. [There is **nothing to affirm**, and so
**creation is immanent with the negativity of the non**: \"[The key
thing may be to **create vacuoles of
noncommunication**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Deleuze 1997: 175).

The Reality of Non-Being

\[9\] My argument, drawing on Deleuze, is that [[the logic of
possibility]{.mark} actually [serves to]{.mark} **modulatively
[reproduce the anti-black grammar of the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Creation, defined as a break with the presently given world, is **not a
possibility**]{.underline}. [It is rather **immanent with an axiomatic
No to such possibility**, with **habits of negativity**]{.underline}.

\[10\] This thesis concerns a key problematic that stems from the
Afro-Pessimist analysis of anti-blackness: [[if
blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~stands~~ \[[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}\]
[[both **within**]{.mark} **the habitus of [modernity, as]{.mark} an
[organizing principle]{.mark}**[, and **without this habitus,
as**]{.mark} **a [perpetually banished subjectivity]{.mark}**[, then
the]{.mark} very [articulation of blackness would seem to]{.mark}
**depend on and [reproduce such a habitus]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
other words, [both *being*-within and *being*-without are possibilities
**governed by modernity\'s dominative positioning of
blackness**]{.underline}. [The articulation of blackness is in fact
bound by this problematic insofar as one remains within the ambit of
habits of affirmation]{.underline}. In other words, [the presumption of
affirmation is co-extensive with the **reproduction of the habitus of
modernity**: **[that which is presently available for affirmation is
already governed by modernity]{.mark} and its articulation of
blackness**, and so habits of affirmation **inevitably participate in
and reproduce the double-bind in which modernity positions
blackness**]{.underline}.

\[11\] [Against such reproduction, it is essential to **insist on habits
of negativity**]{.underline}. [Such insistence is **total**: since it is
affirmation *as such* that entails participation in the being here
indexed by modernity, **[even a modicum of affirmation mitigates the
force enacted by negativity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The power of
creation]{.mark} therefore **[resides entirely]{.mark} and essentially
[on the side of negativity]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[and **not at all on
the side of affirmation**]{.underline}. [Concomitantly, to invoke [such
power]{.mark} actually [entails]{.mark} an **[unmitigated refusal of
habits of affirmation]{.mark}**; affirmation does not name or support,
but on the contrary **denies, the power of creation**]{.underline}.
[Given the double-bind in which modernity positions blackness, this is
to say that [the negativity of the non]{.mark}, in virtue of its
immanence with a force of creation, [indexes blackness as a **power of
non-being**]{.mark}, as that which is without need
of]{.underline}---[and in fact **opposed to**]{.underline}---**[reliance
on the affirmative]{.underline}**.

\[12\] It remains necessary to outline the articulation of this
immanence of creation and non-being---that is, to theoretically express
how an unmitigated insistence on habits of negativity can be both a
refusal of affirmation and an enactment of power. This warrants a return
to Deleuze\'s thought by way of some questions: How can habits of
negativity, articulated via Deleuze\'s insistence on the non, gain
theoretical consistency with his conceptual refusal of negative being?
If negative being is refused, then in what sense can there be insistence
on the non?

\[13\] Deleuze argues that \"[being is difference itself]{.underline}.
[Being is also non-being, **but *non-being is not the being of the
negative***]{.underline} . . . **[non-being is
Difference]{.underline}**\" (Deleuze 1994: 76-77). This makes clear that
[negative being is **refused in virtue of *difference***; what is
essential is difference in itself]{.underline}. [Hence difference is
articulated not as the affirmation of affirmative being, nor even as the
affirmation of being as such]{.underline}. [On the contrary,
**difference is articulated as \"non-being\"**: negative *being* is
refused, but it is **refused in favor of *non*-being**]{.underline}.
[**Difference antecedes both positive being *and* negative being**,
thereby **displacing their dialectical or conflictual
relation**]{.underline}. In other words, [difference is not between
opposed beings but in itself, **autonomous from and antecedent to every
being or thing**; difference is real, but precisely as a matter of
*non*-being]{.underline}. [Its reality is not the being of a thing, **it
is *no*-thing**]{.underline}.

\[14\] [[Such theorization enables the **delinking of
creation**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([as force of non-being, or
no-thing]{.underline}) **[[from affirmation]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([as
possibility of being]{.underline}). [Difference, or non-being, marks a
real force of creation that is **without, and incommensurable with,
being**]{.underline}. [In virtue of this **unanalogizability of
non-being with being**, creation is articulated as a force **stemming
from negativity**, and **not at all from affirmation**: affirmation is
said of being and its possibilization, whereas creation is said of
non-being]{.underline}. [Habits of negativity, which **antagonize**
every]{.underline} ([positively or negatively described]{.underline})
[being, or being as such, are thus coeval with an insistence on the real
force of non-being]{.underline}.

\[15\] [[This]{.mark} argument [can]{.mark} be used to **[negotiate a
tension between]{.mark} the [Afro-Pessimist]{.mark} emphasis on
irresolvable [negativity and]{.mark} the concern of [Black
Optimism]{.mark} to emphasize a power named by blackness**: while the
former\'s emphasis on negativity extends to habits of affirmation as
such, this negativity immanently **involves**]{.underline}---**[and thus
does not abandon]{.underline}**---**[an insistence on the power of
creation]{.underline}**. [Consequently, the Black Op concern to speak of
the power of blackness may be **satisfied entirely within the space of
negativity, or social death**, on which Afro-Pessimism
insists]{.underline}. [Such satisfaction **does not then require
recourse to qualifications that would mitigate the negativity of this
space**]{.underline}, [On the contrary, power is immanent to a
**redoubled negativity**, or a negativity toward both being and the
affirmation of the possibility of being-otherwise]{.underline}.

\[16\] [Yet even as Deleuze\'s philosophical efforts may be deployed by
and for the articulation of [Afro-Pessimist claims]{.mark}, these claims
**vertiginously [intensify Deleuze\'s]{.mark} theorization of
[non-being]{.mark}**: Deleuze theorizes non-being in terms of a
**\"vertigo\" of immanence**]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1996:
48), **[yet blackness is the historical, material experience of such
vertigo]{.underline}**. [Drawing on a distinction made by Wilderson,
this is to say that **[for Deleuze non-being is a \"subjective
vertigo,\"]{.mark} or a vertigo [*into which* Deleuze\'s thought makes
an entrance]{.mark}**[, while **blackness is**]{.mark} **experienced as
[\"objective vertigo,\"]{.mark}** [meaning]{.mark} that vertigo
is]{.underline}---**[historically or
materially]{.underline}**---**[[*always already*
there]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Wilderson 2011: 3). [Immanence, or the
vertigo of non-being, remains an object for the thought of Deleuze;
blackness is **historically or materially the *objective reality of*
non-being**]{.underline}---**[the very reality of the vertigo of
immanence]{.underline}**. Consequently, [to think non-being according to
blackness entails the reading of Deleuze\'s theoretical articulation in
terms of the operations by which historical, material power is
enacted]{.underline}.

#### The affirmative resistance is just a blueprint of anti-blackness -- there move to ground of resistance politics is provided by antiblackness -- in Trump era resistance is wanted by anti-blackness while only being absorbed and gutted for potentiality  

**Sexton '17** (Jared, Interviewed by Daniel Colucciello Barber, \<On
Black Negativity, or the Affirmation of Nothing,
\<http://societyandspace.org/2017/09/18/on-black-negativity-or-the-affirmation-of-nothing/link\>
pg. 9-29, B.M.)

So, this tear in the world, this tearing of the world, this torn world
\... you see indexes of its ramifications within and across the field of
black studies itself---which for me is an unlimited field---that being
part of the dehiscence I mentioned in my earlier essay. I initially
borrowed from the *Écrits* (2006) of Jacques Lacan, where dehiscence
refers, in part, to the internal splitting of the subject by the
imposition of language and the abolition of access, conscious access, to
what might be called a real relation to being. Thereafter, one must
wrestle with language to articulate the inarticulable and, in the
process, live out and live with the effects of such signifying action at
the level of embodiment, affect, memory, and the like. But dehiscence
has a helpful polyvalence---thanks to Richard Yoder for speaking to
this---indicating, in surgical medicine, the opening up of a wound along
the lines of incision (either because the wound was inadequately sutured
or has become infected or subjected to further trauma), or, in botany,
the opening up of plants along a seam at the age of maturity as a means
of dissemination, or, in otology, the perforation in the inner ear
labyrinth causing chronic disequilibrium or vertigo. These themes of
wounding, dissemination, and vertigo all loom large in my
thinking\....In this protracted effort, of course, there is a necessary
element of defense against the undertones---or, more usually, the clear
overtones---of **[anti-blackness that provide both the message and the
medium of the radical betrayal of radicality in thought and action, a
certain ceding of potentiality]{.underline}** (not to be confused with
mere possibility) **[in search of ground, base, foundation. Operating
without need of a base, a willingness to operate in a way that is
groundless, baseless, without foundation]{.underline}** is not just the
good old anti-foundationalism that exercised the minds of late-twentieth
century philosophers, historians, political theorists, and literary and
cultural critics; in part, because there is no rejection of a concept of
totality here. Fanon was tracking something like this, I think, in his
insistence, late in *Black Skin, White Masks*, on "introducing invention
into existence" (Fanon, 2008a: 179). And on this point I really prefer
the Markmann translation to the Philcox translation. Philcox has it as
"introducing invention into life" (Fanon, 2008b: 204), which
unnecessarily restricts Fanon's commentary to the realm of life, or the
*bios*/*zoe* couplet, and leaves aside the entire realm of non-life, or
*geos* (Povinelli, 2016). ..Now, Zizek's "Bartleby politics" are
obviously not quietist, insofar as they are meant to prepare the way for
a true political act. (Frédéric Neyrat \[2014\] has a related
conception: "Rather than its heart, **[passivity should be the skin of
politics. Without passivity, without a 'negative capability,' to refer
to Keats's notion, there isn't any creative imagination, this chaotic
imagination that generates the promises of new worlds]{.underline}**."
And, not for nothing, Hortense Spillers (2003) makes another, earlier
argument for "negative capability" in a pair of essays first published
in the 1990s, "The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual: A Post-Date" and
"All The Things You Could Be By Now If Sigmund Freud's Wife Was Your
Mother: Psychoanalysis and Race." But the interregnum that opens up
between the frenetic, aggressively passive **["activism" of the current
socio-ideological constellation--- in which "the anxious expectation
that nothing will happen" competes with "the desperate demand to do
something"---and that new constellation brought into being by the
introduction of some fundamental indeterminancy---a negativity that is,
as you rightly note above, strictly unfathomable]{.underline}**---that
interregnum would seem to require the cultivation of an oxymoronic
*passive activity*. Does it make sense to speak of a need for
"passivism" (not to be confused with the homophonic term "pacifism")?
Think of the performative contradiction of trying to relax; the harder
you try to attain it, the more it evades you. As every athlete worth
their salt knows, your best performance requires your least effort. [The
more you relax, the more intensely you can exert yourself. In this
scenario, you do more the less you try\...**It's worth thinking about
this seriously in the Trump era**]{.underline} (using Trump here as a
symbol for the consolidation of a whole post-civil rights, post-cold
war, post-9/11 dispensation), **[given how greatly the ongoing
reactionary campaign benefits from and requires any and all imagery of
protest, political or pedestrian, as evidence---"alternative factual
evidence"---supporting a narrative, ultimately, of white victimization
and oppressive black power]{.underline}** (and all the conflictual
transliterations of this antagonism seen today---from the land and
resource battles in the heartland to the travel bans at the borders).
Given, that is, **[how frustratingly ineffective that protest seems to
be in the face of an entire infrastructure that not only absorbs
resistance, but solicits it too]{.underline}**. [It makes you nostalgic
for the days of good old-fashioned repression and co-optation (days
which, of course, never really existed in *black*), because at least
then you knew you were on to something truly oppositional, subversive,
alternate.]{.underline} [I don't think it's a coincidence that, under
such conditions, black (or blackened) artists are drawn with some
regularity to paradoxical ideas about fighting anti-blackness by over-
identifying with its desire to disappear or distort or disfigure
blackness, taking it over and enforcing it hyperbolically, satirically,
even vindictively]{.underline}. I think Paul Beatty's literature has
done this to great effect for twenty years or more---from *White Boy
Shu!e* (1996) to *The Sellout* (2015)---and you could add to that titles
like Darius James's *Negrophobia* (1992) and Kola Boof's *Sexy Part of
the Bible* (2011); consider as well the work of Betye Saar and Kara
Walker and Michael Ray Charles in the visual arts, the comedy of Dave
Chappelle and Leslie Jones, or films like Spike Lee's *Bamboozled*
(2000) and Lars von Trier's *Manderlay* (2005) and Jordan Peele's *Get
Out* (2017). I don't want to get too much into the weeds of the current
conjuncture and lose track of the larger structural problem posed by
blackness and **[anti-blackness]{.underline}**, a problem that confounds
the very distinction between structure and conjuncture in the first
place. It is not just the exigencies of the **[present moment or the
strategic and tactical challenges facing the Movement for Black Lives
that raise the question of how to intervene, of how to introduce
"invention into existence]{.underline}**," as Fanon put it. What I've
called "[a groundless or baseless politics that does not proceed from a
margin of power, a politics with no (final) recourse to foundations of
any sort, a politics forged from critical resources immanent to the
situation, resources from anywhere and anyone, which is to say from
nowhere and no one in particular]{.underline}" (Sexton, 2016b: 589);
**[this approach to politics would seem to entail a total rejection of
transcendence]{.underline}**, a politics of pure immanence without the
Archimedean point. And in one sense it is, but I am attuned to the
difficulties arising from an abandonment of the negative in our
enthusiasm for the affirmative, and so I want to think not so much about
transcendence viz. immanence as about the various forms or modalities of
transcendence and immanence that can be mobilized

###  Blackness

#### Anti-blackness is a structural antagonism that undergirds political life. Their gesture towards non-Black bodies facilitates the expansion of antiblackness, colonialism, and ultimately sustains the ontological foundation and expansion of the current socioeconomic order. 

**Dumas 16** \[Michael J. Dumas, Assistant Professor at the University
of California, Berkeley in the Graduate School of Education and the
Department of African American Studies, "Against the Dark: Antiblackness
in Education Policy and Discourse," *Theory Into Practice* 55:11--19,
2016, published by The College of Education and Human Ecology, The Ohio
State University\]

Antiblackness is the central concern and proposition within an
intellectual project known as Afro-pessimism.[1 [Afro-pessimism
theorizes that **Black people exist in a structurally antagonistic
relationship with humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is, [the very
technologies and imaginations that allow a social recognition of the
humanness of others systematically exclude this possibility for the
Black]{.underline}. [The **Black [cannot be human]{.mark}**, is **not
simply an Other** but is other than]{.underline} [human]{.underline}.
Thus, [antiblackness does not signify a mere racial conflict that might
be resolved through organized political struggle]{.underline} and
appeals to the state and to the citizenry for redress. Instead[,
[antiblackness marks an irreconcilability between the Black and any
sense of social or cultural regard]{.underline}]{.mark}. The aim of
theorizing antiblackness is not to offer solutions to racial inequality,
but to come to a deeper understanding of the Black condition within a
context of utter contempt for, and acceptance of violence against the
Black. Afro-pessimist scholars contend that [the Black is [socially and
culturally positioned as slave]{.mark}]{.underline}, dispossessed of
human agency, desire, and freedom. This is not meant to suggest that
Black people are currently enslaved (by whites or by law), but that
[slavery [marks the ontological position]{.mark} of Black
people]{.underline}. [Slavery is how Black existence is imagined and
enacted upon, and how non-Black people---and particularly whites---
assert their own right to freedom]{.underline}, and right to the
consumption, destruction, and/or simple dismissal of the Black.
"[Through chattel slavery]{.underline}," Frank Wilderson (2010) argued,
[the world gave birth and coherence to both its joys of domesticity and
to its struggles of political discontent]{.underline}; [and with these
joys and struggles the Human was born, but not before it murdered the
Black, forging a symbiosis between the political ontology of Humanity
and the social death of Black]{.underline}s. (pp. 20 -- 21) This "social
death" of the slave is introduced most explicitly in the work of Orlando
Patterson (1982), who detailed how slavery involves a parasitic
relationship between slave owner and slave, such that the freedom of the
slave owner is only secured and understood in relation to power over the
slave. For Patterson, [slavery is "the permanent, violent domination of
natally alienated and generally dishonored persons"]{.underline} (p.
13). [Although slavery involves personal relationships between groups,
it also operates as an institutionalized system, maintained through
social processes that make it impossible for the Slave to live, to be
regarded as alive for her- or himself in the social world.]{.underline}
This focus on slavery might seem anachronistic in the current historical
moment, some 150 years after the (formal) end of the institution in the
United States. However, [[Wilderson maintained that the relations of
power have not changed]{.underline}]{.mark}. He explained: Nothing
remotely approaching claims successfully made on the state has come to
pass. In other words, the election of a Black president aside, [[police
brutality, mass incarceration, segregated and substandard schools and
housing]{.mark}, astronomical rates of HIV infection]{.underline}, [and
the threat of being turned away en masse at the polls [still constitute
the **lived experience of Black life**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} (p. 10)
[This [lived experience serves as a **continual reinscribing** of the
**nonhumanness of the Black**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[a legitimization
of the very antiblackness that has motivated centuries of
violence]{.mark} against Black bodies]{.underline}. In this sense, [even
as slavery is no longer official state policy and practice, the slave
endures in the social imagination, and also in the everyday suffering
experienced by Black people.]{.underline} As Saidiya Hartman (2007)
insisted, Americans are living in what she described as "**[the
afterlife of slavery]{.underline}**:" [[Black lives are still imperiled
and devalued by a racial calculus]{.mark} and a political arithmetic
that were entrenched centuries ago]{.underline}. This is the afterlife
of slavery---**[skewed life chances]{.underline}**, **[limited access to
health]{.underline}** and education, **[premature death]{.underline}**,
**[incarceration]{.underline}**, and **[impoverishment]{.underline}**.
I, too, am the afterlife of slavery. (p. 6) Importantly here, the
afterlife of slavery is not only an historical moment, but deeply
impressed upon Black flesh, in the embodiment of the Black person as
slave. Thus, Hartman maintained, she is also this afterlife of slavery.
Salamishah Tillet (2012) made clear the heaviness of the historical
memory, the everpresence of slavery in Black life: [Because racial
exclusion has become part and parcel of African American political
identity since slavery, it cannot simply be willed or wished
away]{.underline}. [This protracted experience of disillusionment,
mourning, and yearning is in fact the basis of]{.underline} African
American **[civic estrangement]{.underline}**. Its lingering is not just
a haunting of the past but is also a reminder of the present-day
[[racial inequities that keep African American citizens in an
indeterminate, unassimilable state as a racialized
'Other.']{.underline}]{.mark} While the affect of racial melancholia was
bred in the dyad of slavery and democracy, it persists because of the
paradox of legal citizenship and civic estrangement. (p. 9) To the
extent that there is ample evidence of the civic estrangement of Black
people---their exclusion from the public sphere---one can theorize that
the Black is still socially positioned as the slave, as difficult as it
may be to use this frame to understand contemporary "race relations."
Here, "race relations" is necessarily in quotations because there is
really no relation to be had between master and slave in the way one
might conceptualize human relationships. For Afro-pessimists, [the Black
is not only misrecognized, but unrecognizable as human, and therefore
[there is no social or political relationship to be fostered or
restored]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Wilderson argued, Our
analysis cannot be approached through the rubric of gains or reversals
in struggles with the state and civil society, not unless and until the
interlocutor first explains how the Slave is of the world. The onus is
not on one who posits the Master/Slave dichotomy but on the one who
argues there is a distinction between Slaveness and Blackness. How,
when, and where did such a split occur? (p. 11) And this is the broader
challenge posed by a theory of antiblackness: [There is no clear
historical moment in which there was a break between slavery
and]{.underline} [acknowledgement of Black citizenship and
Human-ness]{.underline}; nor is there any indication of a clear
disruption of the technologies of violence---that is, the institutional
structures and social processes---that maintain Black subjugation. Thus,
Afro-pessimists suggest that one must consider the Black as (still)
incapable of asking for (civil or human) rights. This does not deny the
long legacy of Black racial struggle, but it positions this struggle as
an impossibility, because [the Black is (still) imagined outside of the
citizenship that allows claims for redress to be regarded as legitimate,
or even logical.]{.underline} Part of the challenge in theorizing
blackness in contemporary race discourse is that Americans are living in
an officially antiracist society, in which, as Jodi Melamed has
documented, postWorld War II racial liberalisms and neoliberalisms make
some space for the participation of multicultural subjects (Melamed,
2011). That is, [even as race continues to structure
capitalism]{.underline}, which in turn facilitates white accumulation,
[the official stance of the state is against racism]{.underline};
blatantly racist laws and government practices have been declared
illegal, and the market embraces outreach to a wide multicultural range
of consumers. In this context, there is a rush to celebrate the social
and economic advancement of select Black individuals and, perhaps more
significantly, the success of other groups of people of color. In fact,
it is the social and cultural inclusion of non-Black people of color
that is often offered as evidence of the end of racial animus and racial
barriers in the society. Therefore, [the failure of large swaths of the
Black population is purported to be a result of cultural deficits within
the Black]{.underline}. The slave, always suspected of being lazy and
shiftless, now must bear primary responsibility for not making it in a
society, which---officially, anyway---thrives on multiracial harmony and
civic participation. Jared Sexton (2008, 2010) contended that in this
era, [[multiracialism thrives largely at the expense
of]{.underline},]{.mark} and firmly against,
[[blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}. His argument rests on the premise that
the color line is more fluid during periods in which Black freedom is
thought to be most contained. Thus, during slavery in the United States,
multiracial communities could serve as "buffer classes between whites
and blacks" which often "corroborated and collaborated with
antiblackness" (Sexton, 2008, p. 12). The current period is marked by
similar dynamics, [[with little organized Black political
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}, [resegregation]{.underline} of
neighborhoods and schools, [and]{.underline}, in fact, an easy
deterritorialization and [gentrification]{.underline} of historic Black
urban homeplaces[. The current Black Lives Matter movement]{.underline}
(Garza, 2014), which has emerged in the wake of so many cases of
antiBlack violence, [may yet shift Americans into a period
of]{.underline} heightened [anxiety about Black bodies, but]{.underline}
Sexton's description of the current period is valid: [There is little
fear of Black bodies and]{.underline}, arguably, [an emboldened
antipathy to the Black overall]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in
Sexton's theorizing, [opens up new spaces for multiracial inclusion. In
this moment, the Black --white divide is seen as less consequential and
not as much the result of white attitudes and behaviors]{.underline}. In
these moments, Sexton maintained, the more significant boundary is the
one constructed "between blackness and everything else" (2008, p. 13).
And this is a boundary seemingly constructed and maintained by
recalcitrant Black people against multiracialism, and more to the point,
multiracial progress. [Multiracialism]{.underline}, in Sexton's view,
"[premises its contribution to knowledge]{.underline}, culture and
politics [upon an **evacuation of the historical
richness**]{.underline}, intellectual intensity, cultural expansiveness,
**[and political complexity of Black experience]{.underline}**,
[including]{.underline}, perhaps especially, [its indelible
terrors]{.underline}" (2008, p. 15). [[**Transcending the Black-white
binary**, multiracialism **ostensibly moves people past the** narrowness
and **anachronism of blackness and toward a more** **profitable global
economy** and more **sophisticated cultural milieu**. **Embracing
non-Black bodies of color thus facilitates**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
is facilitated by, **[antiblackness]{.underline}**, [and can be
justified as antiracist precisely because it is inclusive of more than
white. "The \[B\]lack body,"]{.underline} Lewis Gordon contended, "[is
confronted by the situation of its absence]{.underline}" (1997, p. 73).
[This absence]{.underline}---this social death or afterlife of/as the
slave---[positions Black people as the embodiment of
problem]{.underline}, a thing rather than a people suffering from
problems created by antiblackness. Part of the aim of Afropessimist
scholarship is to insist on the humanity of Black people. "Those of us
who seek to understand \[B\]lack people," Gordon concluded, need to
"bear in mind that \[B\]lack people are human beings" (p. 78). In an
anti-Black world, this is easier said than done. In the end, there may
be, as Wilderson suggested, no "roadmap to freedom so extensive it would
free us from the epistemic air we breathe" (2010, p. 338). Even so, like
Gordon, Wilderson suggested that [theorizing antiblackness is important
simply as an existential and political recognition of Black humanity, as
a means "to say we must be free of air, while admitting to knowing no
other source of breath"]{.underline} (p. 338; italics in original).

#### There is an ontological difference between slavery and colonialism -- we must prefigure slavery in order to understand the ways in which whiteness has dispossessed the Savage -- the concept of the law is irredeemable once properly understood for black agency is only ever conceivably legal when it is criminal -- the struggle for indigenous liberation is always appropriative of black struggle in a violent analogization that erases black agency

That is to say, [[in the debate about]{.mark} the
[colonial]{.mark}]{.underline} policy of
[[assimilation]{.underline}]{.mark} and its discontents, a debate in
which Mannoni and Fanon intervene respectively, [[it is
**slavery**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the particular freedom struggle it
engenders [[that mark the critical difference]{.mark}. [Slavery]{.mark}:
that which [reduces]{.mark}]{.underline} 'colonial [[peoples to a molten
state']{.mark} uniquely enabling]{.underline} the metropolitan [power
'to pour them into a new mould', a process in which 'th[e personality of
the native is first destroyed through uprooting, enslavement, and the
collapse of the social structure']{.mark}]{.underline} (Mannoni 1990:
27). For Mannoni, 'assimilation is only practicable where an individual
has been isolated from his group, wrenched from his environment and
transplanted else- where' (Mannoni 1990: 27, emphasis added). Fanon's
historical materialist redaction of Mannoni's psychology of the colonial
relation is to refuse the latter's projection of the 'affective
disorders' produced by colonization into a pre-colonial cultural
eternity. Not so much, perhaps, because such projection would have the
Malagasy desire her own colonizer (like the Inca who Mannoni suggests
desires her own conquistador in an earlier historical period), but
because the contradictions of colonization might provide an even more
problematic recommendation for 'the introduction of slavery' (Mannoni
1990: 27). [[To suffer the loss of political
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, the exploitation of labor, [the
dispossession of land]{.underline} and resources [[is
deplorable]{.mark}; yet, we might say]{.underline} in this light that to
suffer colonization is unenviable unless one is enslaved. One may not be
free, but one is at least not enslaved. More simply, we might say of the
colonized: **[[you may lose your motherland, but you will not 'lose your
mother']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Hartman 2007). [[The latter condition,
the 'social death']{.underline}]{.mark} under which kinship is denied
entirely by the force of law, [[is reserved for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
'natal alienation' and 'genealogical isolation' characterizing
[[slavery]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here is Orlando Patterson, from his
encyclopedic 1982 Slavery and Social Death: I prefer [the term 'natal
alienation']{.underline} because it goes directly to the heart of what
is critical in the slave's forced alienation, the loss of ties of birth
in both ascending and descending generations. It also [has the important
nuance of a loss of native status, of **deracination**. It was this
alienation of the slave from]{.underline} all formal, legally
enforceable [ties of 'blood,' and from any attachment to groups or
localities other than those chosen]{.underline} for him \[sic\] [by the
master]{.underline}, that gave the relation of slavery its peculiar
value to the master. The slave was the ultimate human tool, as
imprintable and as disposable as the master wished. And this was true,
at least in theory, of all slaves, no matter how elevated. (Patterson
1982: 7--8) True even if elevated by the income and formal education of
the mythic American middle class, the celebrity of a Hollywood icon, or
the political position of the so-called Leader of the Free World. 4 The
alienation and isolation of the slave is not only vertical, canceling
ties to past and future generations and rendering thereby the notion of
'descen- dants of slaves' as a strict oxymoron. It is also a horizontal
prohibition, canceling ties to the slave's contemporaries as well.
Reduced to a tool, [[the deracination of the slave]{.underline}]{.mark},
as Mannoni and Fanon each note in their turn, [is total, more
fundamental even than the displacement of the colonized, whose status
obtains [in **a network of persecuted human relations rather than in
a**]{.mark}]{.underline} collection or [**[dispersal of]{.underline}** a
class of **[things]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Crucially, this total
deracination is strictly correlative to the 'absolute submission
mandated by \[slave\] law' discussed rigorously in Saidiya Hartman's
1997 Scenes of Subjection: [the slave estate is the most perfect example
of the space of purely formal obedience defining the jurisdictional
field of sovereignty]{.underline} (Agamben 2000). [Because the forced
submission of the slave is absolute, any signs whatsoever of 'reasoning
... intent and rationality' are recognized 'solely in the context
of]{.underline} criminal liability'. That is, '[the slave's will \[is\]
acknowledged only as it \[is\] prohibited or punished']{.underline}
(Hartman 1997: 82, emphasis added). A criminal will, a criminal
reasoning, a criminal intent, [a criminal rationality]{.underline}: with
these erstwhile human capacities construed as indices of culpability
before the law, even the potentiality of slave resistance is rendered
illegitimate and illegible a priori. [The disqualification of black
resistance by the logic of racial slavery is not unrelated to the
longstanding cross-racial phenomenon in which]{.underline} the white
bourgeois and proletarian [revolutions]{.underline} on both sides of the
Atlantic can [allegorize themselves as revolts against slavery, while
the]{.underline} hemispheric [black struggle against actually existing
slavery cannot authorize itself literally in those same terms. The
latter must code itself as the apotheosis of the French and American
revolutions]{.underline} (with their themes of Judeo-Christian
deliverance) or, later, the Russian and Chinese revolutions (with their
themes of secular messianic trans- formation) [or]{.underline}, later
still, [the broad anti-colonial movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America of the mid-20th century (with their themes of indigenous
reclamation and renaissance)]{.underline}. 5 **[[One]{.mark} of the
[defining features of contemporary political and intellectual culture
remains this metaphoric transfer that appropriates black suffering as
the template for non-black grievances]{.mark}, while it misrecognizes
the singularity of black struggles against racial slavery]{.underline}**
and what Loïc Wacquant calls its 'functional surrogates' or what Hartman
terms its 'afterlife'. Put differently, 'the occult presence of racial
slavery' continues to haunt our political imagination: 'nowhere, but
nevertheless everywhere, a dead time which never arrives and does not
stop arriving' (Marriott 2007: xxi). Hartman's notion of slavery's
afterlife and Wacquant's theorization of slavery's functional surrogates
are two productive recent attempts to name the interminable terror of
slavery, but we are still very much within the crisis of language -- of
thinking and feeling, seeing and hearing -- that slavery provokes. Both
scholars challenge the optimistic idea of a residual 'legacy' of
slavery, precisely because it requires the untenable demarcation of an
historic end in Emancipation. [The relations of slavery live
on]{.underline}, Hartman might say, after the death knell of formal
abolition, mutating into 'the burdened individuality of freedom'.The
functions of the chattel system are largely maintained,Wacquant might
say, despite the efforts of Reconstruction, preserved in surrogate
institutional form under Jim Crow, the ghetto, and the prison. Slavery
lives on, it survives, despite the grand attempts on its institutional
life forged by the international movements against slavery, segregation
and mass imprisonment (Davis 2003). But what if slavery does not die, as
it were, because it is immortal, but rather because it is non-mortal,
because it has never lived, at least not in the psychic life of power?
What if the source of slavery's longevity is not its resilience in the
face of opposition, but the obscurity of its existence? Not the
accumulation of its political capital, but the illegibility of its
grammar? On this account, for those that bear the mark of slavery -- the
trace of blackness -- to speak is to sound off without foundation, to
appear as a ghost on the threshold of the visible world, a spook
retaining (only) the negative capacity to absent the
presence,ornegatethewilltopresence,ofeveryclaimtohumanbeing,evenperhapsthefugi-
tive movement of stolen life explored masterfully by Fred Moten (2008).
We might rethink as well the very fruitful notion of 'fugitive justice'
that shapes the prize-winning 2005 special issue of Representations on
'Redress'. Co-editors Saidiya Hartman and Stephen Best are posing the
right question: ['How does one compensate for centuries of violence that
have as their consequence the impossibility of restoring a prior
existence, of giving back what was taken, of repairing what was
broken?]{.underline}' (Hartman and Best 2005: 2) That is to say, they
are thinking about 'the question of slavery in terms of the incomplete
nature of abolition', 'the contemporary predicament of freedom' (2005:
5, emphasis added). Yet, the notion subsequently developed of a fugitive
life 'lived in loss' -- spanning the split difference between grievance
and grief, remedy and redress, law and justice, hope and resignation --
relies nonetheless on an outside, however improbable or impossible, as
the space of possibility, of movement, of life. Returning to our
schematization of Fanon, we can say that [the outside is a concept
embedded in **the problématique of colonization and its imaginary
topography**, indeed, the fact that it can imagine topographically at
all. But, even if the freedom dreams of the black radical imagination do
conjure images of place]{.underline} (and to do here does not imply that
one can in either sense of the latter word: able or permitted); [what
both the fact of blackness and the lived experience of the black name
for us]{.underline}, in their discrepant registers, [is an anti-black
world for which **there is no outside**]{.underline}. 6 'The language of
race developed in the modern period and in the context of the slave
trade' (Hartman 2007: 5). And [if that]{.underline} context is our
context and that [context is the world, then]{.underline} this is the
principal insight revealed by the contemporary predicament of freedom:
[there is no such thing as a fugitive slave. Malcolm X]{.underline}, by
another route, [was not far from this]{.underline} formulation in his
famous 'The Ballot or the Bullet' address, delivered 3 April 1964 at the
Cory Methodist Church in Cleveland, Ohio. Speaking to the risks of
political confrontation with the structures of racial domination, he
exhorts: ['If you go to jail, so what? If you black, you were born in
jail. If you black, you were born in jail, in the North as well as the
South. Stop talking about the South. Long as you south of the Canadian
border, you're south.']{.underline} For blacks in the USA, [the
political borders of the nation-state mark the walls of a social
incarceration, a political ontology of race **uninterrupted by ontic
differences of region or legal standing.** Of course, Malcolm X did not
restrict his commentary to the USA]{.underline}, even if recent devel-
opments in national electoral politics were the focus of this particular
address. [His]{.underline} evolv- ing [analysis accommodated a much
larger geographical scale]{.underline}, what he elsewhere designated
'white world supremacy'. [But]{.underline} if there is any weight to his
insistence that the Mason-Dixon Line, demarcating [the
territories]{.underline} of a still unresolved civil war, or even the
prison wall, constituting liberal democracy's internal hard edge, **[are
incidental to black life]{.underline}** -- this from a former prisoner
of over six years -- should we not extend this reasoning to the ultimate
penalty, the absolute master, and stop talking about death as the limit
of black life? Not a loss (of life and limb, liberty and property), but
a never having had. Not only the figurative 'nothing to lose but your
chains' of the proletariat, but the literal inability to lose (because
unable to own, to accumulate, to have and to hold, to self-possess) at
all. Can't have (even when we got), can't be (even when we are): a
strange freedom in the heart of slavery. 'The political ontology of
race' is a phrase borrowed from work of political theorist Frank B.
Wilderson, III, where it has been elaborated from his 2003 Social
Identities article, 'Gramsci's Black Marx', to his 2008 American Book
Award-winning memoir, Incognegro: A Memoir of Exile and Apartheid, and
his forthcoming Red,White, and Black: Cinema and the Structure of US
Antagonisms. Drawing heavily upon Gordon and Fanon, alongside the early
Patterson, the ongoing research of Wacquant on the four 'peculiar
institutions' that have 'operated to define, confine, and control
African Americans in the history of the United States' (Wacquant 2002:
41), and an array of noted literary critics and historians (e.g. David
Eltis, Lindon Barrett, Saidiya Hartman, Ronald A.T. Judy, David
Marriott, Hortense Spillers); Wilderson supplants the paradigm of
comparative ethnic and racial studies in two principle ways. First, by
moving conceptually from the empirical to the structural, especially
insofar as the question of differential racialization -- or the compli-
cations of racial hierarchy -- makes recourse to a comparative
sociology, measuring relative rates of infant mortality, poverty,
illiteracy, high school graduation, hate crimes, impris- onment,
electoral participation, and so on. Second, by reframing racism (pace
Fanon) as a social relationship that is grounded in anti-blackness
rather than white supremacy. What Wilderson demonstrates at length is
that 'the racialization of the globe' (Dikötter 2008) or the formation
of the 'world racial system' (Winant 2002) does not adhere strictly to
Du Bois's thesis on the color line -- 'the relation of the darker to the
lighter races of men \[sic\] in Asia and Africa, in America and the
islands of the sea' -- in which 'Negro slavery' is referred to as but
one 'phase' of a general problem. Rather, slavery establishes the
vestibule of the category of the Human. To be sure, Humans do not live
under con- ditions of equality in the modern world. In fact, [[modernity
is]{.underline},]{.mark} to a large degree, [[marked]{.mark}
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} societies structured in dominance: [[patriarchy
and white supremacy, settler colonialism and extra-territorial conquest,
imperialist warfare and genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}, class struggle
and the international division of labor. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
Wilderson, [[there is a qualitative difference, an ontological one,
between the]{.mark}]{.underline} inferiorization or
[[dehumanization]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} the masses of [[people
'in]{.underline}]{.mark} Asia ... in Ame[r]{.underline}ica and the
islands of the sea', [[including the colonization
of]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[land and resources]{.underline}]{.mark},
the exploitation of their labor and even their extermination in whole or
in part, [[and the singular com- modification of human being pursued
under racial slavery, that structure of gratuitous violence in which
bodies are rendered as flesh to be accumulated and
exchanged]{.underline}]{.mark}. 7 On this score, we should note that
'the absolute submission mandated by law was not simply that of slave to
his or her owner, but the submission of the enslaved before all whites'
(Hartman 1997: 83). The latter group is perhaps better termed all
non-blacks (or the unequally arrayed category of non-blackness), because
it is racial blackness as a necessary condition for enslavement that
matters most, rather than whiteness as a sufficient condition for
freedom. The structural position of the Indian slaveholder -- or, for
that matter, the smattering of free black slaveholders in the USA or the
slaveholding mulatto elite in the Caribbean -- is a case in point
(Blackburn 1997; Koger 2006; Miles and Holland 2006). Freedom from the
rule of slave law requires only that one be considered non-black,
whether that non-black racial designation be 'white' or 'Indian' or, in
the rare case, 'Oriental' -- this despite the fact that each of these
groups have at one point or another labored in conditions similar to or
contiguous with enslaved African-derived groups. In other words, it is
not labor relations, but property relations that are constitutive of
slavery.

coopted**]{.mark} **and expropriated [by world leaders who share
the]{.mark} same [culture of racial dominance]{.mark} and

**divorced peace from freedom,**]{.underline} **[from feminism, from
education reform, from legal rights, from human rights, from
international alliances and friendships, from national liberation, from
the particular]{.underline}** (for example, black female, Native

Nevertheless, social movements such as [the civil rights-black power
movement]{.underline} in the United States [have always demanded peace
with justice, with liberation, and with social and economic
reconstruction]{.underline} and cultural freedom at home and abroad.
[[The integration of our past and our present holocausts and]{.mark}
[our struggle to]{.mark} define our own lives and have our basic needs
met]{.underline} **[[are at the core of the inseparable struggles for
world peace and social betterme]{.mark}nt.]{.underline}** The Achilles
heel of the organized peace movement in this country has always been its
whiteness. In this multi-racial and racist society, no allwhite movement
can have the strength to bring about basic changes. It is axiomatic that
basic changes do not occur in any society unless the people who are
oppressed move to make them occur. In our society it is people of color
who are the most oppressed. Indeed our entire history teaches us that
when people of color have organized and struggled-most especially,
because of their particular history, Black people-have moved in a more
humane direction as a society, toward a better life for all people.1
Western man\'s whiteness, imagination, enlightened science, and
[movements toward peace have **developed from a culture and history
mobilized against women of color**]{.underline}. [The political
advancements of white men have grown directly from **the devastation and
holocaust of people of color and our lands**]{.underline}. This
technological and material progress has been in direct proportion to the
undevelopment of women of color. Yet [the dayto- day survival, political
struggles, and rising up of women of color,]{.underline} especially
black women in the United States, [reveal both complex resistance to
holocaust and undevelopment and often conflicted responses to the
military and war]{.underline}. The Holocausts [[Women of color
are]{.mark} **survivors of and [remain casualties of
holocausts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and **[we are direct victims of
war]{.underline}**-that is, of open armed conflict between countries or
between factions within the same country. But [women of color were not
soldiers]{.underline}, [nor did we trade animal pelts or slaves to the
white man for guns]{.underline}, [nor did we sell or lease our lands to
the white man for wealth]{.underline}. Most [[men and women of color
**resisted and fought back**, were **slaughtered**, **enslaved**, and
**force marched** ]{.mark}**into plantation labor camps** to serve the
white masters of war and to build their empires and war
machines]{.underline}. [People of color were and are victims of
holocausts]{.underline}-that is, [of great and widespread destruction,
usually by fire]{.underline}. [The world as we knew and created it was
destroyed in a continual scorched earth policy]{.underline} of the white
man. The experience of Jews and other Europeans under the Nazis can
teach us the value of understanding the totality of destructive intent,
the extensiveness of torture, and the demonical apparatus of war aimed
at the human spirit. A Jewish father pushed his daughter from the lines
of certain death at Auschwitz and said, \"You will be a remembrance-You
tell the story. You survive.\" She lived. He died. Many have criticized
the Jews for forcing non-Jews to remember the 6 million Jews who died
under the Nazis and for etching the names Auschwitz and Buchenwald,
Terezin and Warsaw in our minds. Yet as [[women of
color]{.underline},]{.mark} we, too, [[are \"remembrances\" of]{.mark}
all [the holocausts]{.mark} against the people of the world. [We must
remember the names of]{.mark} **concentration camps such as Jesus,
Justice, Brotherhood, and Integrity**]{.underline}[, **[ships that
carried millions]{.underline}** ]{.mark}[**of African men, women, and
children [chained and brutalized]{.mark}** across the ocean to the \"New
World.\"]{.underline} [We must remember the Arawaks, the Taino, the
Chickasaw, the Choctaw, the Narragansett, the Montauk, the
Delaware]{.underline}, [and the other Native American names of thousands
of U.S. towns that stand for tribes of people who are no
more]{.underline}. [[We must remember the holocausts visited
against]{.mark} the Hawaiians]{.underline}, [the [aboriginal peoples of
Australia]{.mark}, the Pacific Island peoples, and the women and
children of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.underline}. [We must remember **the
slaughter of men and women** at Sharpeville, the children of Soweto, and
the men of Attica]{.underline}. [We must never, ever, forget **the
children disfigured, the men maimed, and the women broken in** our
holocausts]{.underline}-[we must remember the names, the numbers, the
faces, and the stories and teach them to our children and our
children\'s children so the world can never forget our
suffering]{.underline} and our courage. Whereas the particularity of the
Jewish holocaust under the Nazis is over, [**[our holocausts
continue]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [We are the madres locos]{.underline}
(crazy mothers) [in the Argentinian square silently **demanding news of
our missing kin from the fascists who rule.**]{.underline} [[We are the
children of El Salvador who **see our mothers and fathers shot in front

Lebanese women and children overrun by Israeli, Lebanese, and U.S.
soldiers**]{.underline}. [We are **the women and children of the
bantustans and refugee camps** and the prisoners of Robbin
Island]{.underline}. [[We are the **starving in the Sahel**, the **poor

are the brothers and sisters of Grenada who carry the seeds of the New
Jewel Movement in our hearts, not daring to speak of it with our
lipsyet. Our holocaust is South Africa ruled by men who loved Adolf
Hitler, who have developed the Nazi techniques of terror to more
sophisticated levels. Passes replace the Nazi badges and stars. Skin
color is the ultimate badge of persecution. Forced removals of women,
children, and the elderly-the \"useless appendages of South
Africa\"-into barren, arid bantustans without resources for survival
have replaced the need for concentration camps. Black sex-segregated
barracks and cells attached to work sites achieve two objectives: The
work camps destroy black family and community life, a presumed source of
resistance, and attempt to create human automatons whose purpose is to
serve the South African state\'s drive toward wealth and hegemony. Like
other fascist regimes, South Africa disallows any democratic rights to
black people; they are denied the right to vote, to dissent, to peaceful
assembly, to free speech, and to political representation. The regime
has all the typical Nazi-like political apparatus: house arrests of
dissenters such as Winnie Mandela; prison murder of protestors such as
Stephen Biko; penal colonies such as Robbin Island. Black people,
especially children, are routinely arrested without cause, detained
without limits, and confronted with the economic and social disparities
of a nation built around racial separation. Legally and economically,
South African apartheid is structural and institutionalized racial war.
The Organization of African Unity\'s regional intergovernmental meeting
in 1984 in Tanzania was called to review and appraise the achievements
of the United Nations Decade for Women. The meeting considered South
Africa\'s racist apartheid regime a peace issue. The \"regime is an
affront to the dignity of all Africans on the continent and a stark
reminder of the absence of equality and peace, representing the worst
form of institutionalized oppression and strife.\" Pacifists such as
Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi who have used nonviolent
resistance charged that those who used violence to obtain justice were
just as evil as their oppressors. Yet all successful revolutionary
movements have used organized violence. This is especially true of
national liberation movements that have obtained state power and
reorganized the institutions of their nations for the benefit of the
people. If men and women in South Africa do not use organized violence,
they could remain in the permanent violent state of the slave. Could it
be that pacifism and nonviolence cannot become a way of life for the
oppressed? Are they only tactics with specific and limited use for
protecting people from further violence? For most people in the
developing communities and the developing world consistent nonviolence
is a luxury; it presumes that those who have and use nonviolent weapons
will refrain from using them long enough for nonviolent resisters to win
political battles. To survive, peoples in developing countries must use
a varied repertoire of issues, tactics, and approaches. Sometimes arms
are needed to defeat apartheid and defend freedom in South Africa;
sometimes nonviolent demonstrations for justice are the appropriate
strategy for protesting the shooting of black teenagers by a white man,
such as happened in New York City. [**[Peace is not merely an absence of
\'conflict that enables white middleclass comfort]{.underline}**, **[nor
is it simply resistance to nuclear war]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and war
machinery]{.underline}**. [[The **litany of \"you will be blown up,
too\"**]{.underline} **[directed by a white man to a black woman
obscures the permanency and institutionalization of war, the violence
and holocaust that people of color face daily]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Unfortunately, [the holocaust does not only refer to the mass murder of
Jews, Christians, and atheists during the Nazi regime; it]{.underline}
also [refers to **the permanent institutionalization of war that is part
of every fascist and racist regime. [The holocaust lives. It is a threat
to world peace as pervasive and thorough as nuclear
war.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Link - Hegemony

#### US hegemony is just the racial violence of America gone global --aff claims to benevolence are symptoms of white privilege

**Rodriguez '07** \[Dylan, PhD in Ethnic Studies Program of the
University of California Berkeley and Associate Proffessor of Ethnic
Studies at University of California Riverside, "American Globality And
the US Prison regime: State Violence And White Supremacy from Abu Ghraib
to Stockton to bagong diwa", Ateneo de Manila University, 2007, Kritika
Kultura 9 (2007): 022-048\]

In fact, [[the notion of American globality]{.underline}]{.mark} I have
begun discussing here [[already exceeds]{.underline}]{.mark} negri and
Hardt's formulation [to [the extent that it is a global racial
formation, and more pointedly a global mobilization of a white
supremacist social formation]{.mark}]{.underline} (read: a united States
of America formed by the social-economic geographies of racial chattel
slavery and their recodification through the post-13th Amendment
innovation of other technologies of criminalization and imprisonment).
The [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} prison regime's [[production of human
immobilization and death composes some of the fundamental modalities of
American national coherence]{.underline}. It
[inscribes]{.underline}]{.mark} two forms of
[[domination]{.underline}]{.mark} that tend to slip from the attention
of political theorists, including Negri and Hardt: first, the
[[prison]{.underline} [regime]{.underline} [strategically
institutionalizes the biopolitical structures of white
racial/nationalist ascendancy---it quite concretely provides a
definition for white American personhood, citizenship, freedom, and
racialized patriotism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second, [the prison regime
reflects the moral, spiritual, and cultural inscription of Manifest
Destiny (and its descendant material cultural and state-building
articulations of racist and white supremacist conquest, genocide, and
population control) across different historical moments.]{.underline} to
invoke and critically rearticulate negri and Hardt's formulation, the
focal question becomes: [[How does the right of the US-as-global police
to kill, detain, obliterate become voiced, juridically coded, and
culturally recoded? the structure of presumption---and therefore
relative political silence---enmeshing the prison's centrality to the
logic of American globality is precisely evidence of the fundamental
power of the uS prison regime within the larger schema of American
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this sense the uS prison regime is
ultimately really not an "institution." rather it is a formulation of
world order (hence, a dynamic and perpetual labor of
institutionalization rather than a definitive modernist institution) in
which massively scaled, endlessly strategized technologies of human
immobilization address (while never fully resolving) the socio-political
crises of globalization. The US prison regime defines a global logic of
social organization that constitutes, mobilizes, and prototypes across
various localities. What would it mean, then, to consider state-crafted,
white supremacist modalities of imprisonment as the perpetual end rather
than the self-contained means of American globality? I am suggesting a
conception of the prison regime that focuses on what cultural and
political theorist Allen Feldman calls a "formation of violence," which
anchors the contemporary articulation of white supremacy as a global
technology of coercion and hegemony. Feldman writes, the growing
autonomy of violence as a self-legitimating sphere of social discourse
and transaction points to the inability of any sphere of social practice
to totalize society. [[Violence itself both reflects and accelerates the
experience of society as an incomplete project, as something to be made.
As a formation of violence that self-perpetuates a peculiar social
project through the discursive structures of warfare, the US prison
regime composes an acute formation of racial and white supremacist
violence,]{.underline} a]{.mark}nd thus houses the capacity for
mobilization of an epochal (and peculiar) white supremacist global
logic. This contention should not be confused with the sometimes
parochial (if not politically chauvinistic) proposition that American
state and state-sanctioned regimes of bodily violence and human
immobilization are somehow self-contained "domestic" productions that
are exceptional to the united States of America, and that other "global"
sites simply "import," imitate, or reenact these institutionalizations
of power. In fact, I am suggesting the opposite: the [[US prison regime
exceeds as it enmeshes the ensemble of social relations that cohere uS
civil society, and is fundamental to the geographic transformations,
institutional vicissitudes, and militarized/economic mobilizations of
"globalization" generally]{.mark}.]{.underline} to assert this, however,
is to also argue that the constituting violence of the US prison regime
has remained somewhat undertheorized and objectified in the overlapping
realms of public discourse, activist mobilization, and (grassroots as
well as professional) scholarly praxis.

Here I am arguing that [[it is not possible to conceptualize and
critically address the emergence and global proliferation of the
(uS/global) prison industrial complex outside a fundamental
understanding of what are literally its technical and technological
premises]{.underline}: namely, [its complex]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[organization and creative production of racist and white
supremacist]{.mark} bodily violence]{.underline}. It is only in this
context, I would say, that we can examine the problem of how "the
Prison" is a modality (and not just a reified product or outcome) of
American statecraft in the current political moment. It is only a
theoretical foregrounding of the white supremacist state and social
formation of the united States that will allow us to understand the uS
prison regime as an American globality that materializes as it
prototypes state violence and for that matter, "state power" itself
through a specific institutional site.

### Link - Performance

#### Their faith in performance and conceptual rupturing as an act of emancipation trades off with structural analysis and puts false place in subjectivity 

**Wilderson 2010,** \[2010, Frank B. Wilderson is an Associate Professor
of African-American Studies at UC Irvine and has a Ph.D. from UC
Berkeley, "Red, White & Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S.
Antagonisms,"\]

Unfortunately, cultural studies that theorizes the interface between
Blacks and Humans is hobbled in its attempts to (a) expose power
relationships and (b) examine how relations of power influence and shape
cultural practice. [[Cultural studies insists on a grammar of suffering
which assumes that we are all positioned essentially by way of the
symbolic order]{.underline}]{.mark}, what Lacan calls the wall of
language---[[and as such our potential for stasis or
change]{.underline}]{.mark} (our capacity for being oppressed or free)
[[is overdeter-mined by our \"universal\" ability or inability to seize
and wield discursive weapons. This idea corrupts the explanatory power
of]{.underline}]{.mark} most socially engaged films and [[even the most
radical line of political action because]{.mark}]{.underline} it
produces a cinema and a politics that cannot account for the grammar of
suffering of the Black---the Slave. To put it bluntly, the imaginative
labor5 of cinema, political action, and cultural studies are all
afflicted with the same theoretical aphasia. [[They are speechless in
the face of gratuitous violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This theoretical
aphasia is symptomatic of a debilitated ensemble of questions regarding
political ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}. At its heart are two registers
of imaginative labor. The first register is that of description, the
rhetorical labor aimed at explaining the way relations of power are
named, categorized, and explored. The second register can be
characterized as prescription, [[the rhetorical labor predicated on the
notion that everyone can be emancipated through some form of discursive,
or symbolic, intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[But emancipation
through some form of discursive or symbolic intervention is wanting in
the face of a subject position that is not a subject
position]{.underline}]{.mark}---what Marx calls \"a speaking implement\"
or what Ronald Judy calls \"an interdiction against subjectivity.\" In
other words, the Black has sentient capacity but no relational capacity.
[[As an accumulated and fungible object, rather than an exploited and
alienated subject, the Black is openly vulnerable to the whims of the
world, and so is his or her cultural \"production.\" What does it
mean---what are the stakes---when the world can whimsically transpose
one\'s cultural gestures, the stuff of symbolic intervention, onto
another worldly good, a commodity of style]{.underline}]{.mark}? Frantz
Fanon echoes this question when he writes, \"I came into the world
imbued with the will to find a meaning in things, my spirit filled with
the desire to attain to the source of the world, and then I found that I
was an object in the midst of other objects.\" He clarifies this
assertion and alerts us to the stakes which the optimistic assumptions
of film studies and cultural studies, the counterhegemonic promise of
alternative cinema, and the emancipatory project of coalition politics
cannot account for, when he writes: \"Ontology---once it is finally
admitted as leaving existence by the wayside---does not permit us to
understand the being of the black.\"6 This presents a challenge to film
production and to film studies given their cultivation and elaboration
by the imaginative labor of cultural studies, underwritten by the
assumptive logic of Humanism; because if everyone does not possess the
DNA of culture, that is, (a) time and space transformative capacity, (b)
a relational status with other Humans through which one\'s time- and
space-transformative capacity is recognized and incorporated, and (c) a
relation to violence that is contingent and not gratuitous, then how do
we theorize a sentient being who is positioned not by the DNA of culture
but by the structure of gratuitous violence? How do we think outside of
the conceptual framework of subalternity---that is, outside of the
explanatory power of cultural studies---and think beyond the pale of
emancipatory agency by way of symbolic intervention? [[I am calling for
a different conceptual framework, predicated not on the subject-effect
of cultural performance but on the structure of political ontology, a
framework that allows us to substitute a culture of politics for a
politics of culture]{.underline}]{.mark}. The value in this rests not
simply in the way it would help us rethink cinema and performance, but
in the way it can help us theorize what is at present only intuitive and
anecdotal: the unbridgeable gap between Black being and Human life. To
put a finer point on it, such a framework might enhance the explanatory
power of theory, art, and politics by destroying and perhaps
restructuring the ethical range of our current ensemble of questions.
[[This has profound implications]{.mark} [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
non-Black film studies, Black film studies, and African American
[[studies writ large because they are currently entangled
in]{.underline} [a multicultural paradigm that takes an interest in an
insufficiently critical comparative analysis--- that is, a comparative
analysis in pursuit of a coalition politics]{.underline}]{.mark} (if not
in practice then at least as a theorizing metaphor) [[which, by its very
nature, crowds out and forecloses the Slave\'s grammar of
suffering]{.underline}.]{.mark}

### Link - Queerness

#### Thinking queerness as an identity, performance or set of practices obscures the prior ontological queerness of blackness, which exists as the absolute index of otherness over and against which humanity and modernity vouchsafe their value and coherence. This failure to theorize gender and sexuality from the underside of the human is a failure to interrogate the very template of deviance that haunts queerness, ensuring anti-black homonormative identification.

**Jackson 2011** \[Zakiyyah, PhD candidate in African diaspora studies
in the African American studies department at the University of
California, Berkeley, "Waking Nightmares," *GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian
and Gay Studies*, Vol. 17, No. 2-3\]

Marriott's scholarship reminds us that [queer theory may unwittingly
diminish its criticality if it fails to acknowledge the role antiblack
racism plays in shaping the discursive practices of gender and
sexuality. [The violence that produces blackness necessitates that from
the existential vantage point of black lived experience, gender and
sexuality lose their coherence as normative
categori]{.mark}es]{.underline}.8 Moreover, [[as queer theory attempts
to map a territory that encompasses an increasingly generalized
nonnormativity]{.mark}, [it may]{.mark} unwittingly [overlook the
function of blackness in modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}, since the black
body has been rendered the "absolute index of otherness." 9 While
particular nonblack sexual and gendered practices may be queered,
[[blackness serves as an essential template of gendered and sexual
"deviance" that is limited to the negation not of a particular practice
but of a state of being]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, [[there
are no practices that an individual black person can take up that will
settle once and for all the doubt that accompanies the assertion of a
black humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Marriott's texts encourage us to
interrogate the subject of feminist and queer theory rather than presume
that a subject is always and already there. Marriott's writing invites
us to reflect on aspects of gendered and sexualized racial experience
that often go unaccounted for in scholarly work on race, despite the
efforts of black feminism and its theories of intersectionality.
Feminists of color have encouraged us to think about gender and
sexuality as they intersect with the particularities of race and
embodiment. In the context of blackness, gender oppression not only
circumscribes the life chances of women but also stratifies or suspends
the category of manhood.10 Black men are seen as "excessively male and
insufficiently masculine."11 Historically, black men's "inversion" has
served as an alibi for their rape and castration, painful reminders that
rape is, as feminists state, "about power" rather than contingent on an
essentialized female vulnerability or an inherent male power.
[[Existential negation]{.mark}, which we refer to as "race" in polite
conversation]{.underline}, substantially complicates our theorization of
"black patriarchy" and "black sexuality." It [[requires us to theorize
gendered and sexual violence from the underside of "the human,"
which]{.mark} arguably [necessitates that we think about queerness as
something other than an identity, gender, or even set of sexual
practices]{.mark}. [We might think of black queerness as an existential
matter rather than as an attribution that accompanies only some black
subjectivities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Marriott reminds us that nonbeing
is the existential burden facing black people under the conditions of
(post)modernity and also the specter that haunts queer subjectivity.
This is fitting considering that [the birth of "homosexuality" is
inextricable from the rise of scientific authority and its racism.
[Fantasies of blackness]{.mark}, particularly black female sexuality,
[are the gendered and racial specters that haunt queerness --- that from
which homonormative subjects must distance themselves in order to be
properly recognized as humans]{.mark}, as citizens, as
subjects]{.underline}. Despite prior interdictions on same-sex
sexuality, it is only as recently as the late nineteenth century that
sexual acts and desires became constitutive of identity: the homosexual
becomes a type.12 In Siobhan Somerville's "Scientific Racism and the
Invention of the Homosexual Body," she queries, "[is it merely a
historical coincidence that the classification of bodies as either
'homosexual' or 'heterosexual' emerged at the same time that the United
States was aggressively policing the imaginary boundary between 'black'
and 'white' bodies?]{.underline}"13 Somerville goes on to suggest the
mutually constitutive effects of the bifurcated categories of race and
sexuality, their structural interdependence and mutual production.
[Structures and methodologies that drove dominant scientific ideologies
of race were subsequently taken up in the scientific pursuit of an
emerging discourse of sexuality]{.underline}. Difference was thought to
be a visualizable fact inscribed on the body; according to this logic,
interiority could be read on the surface of the body's anatomical
markers. Racial difference seemed to hinge on and be most represented by
the supposed differences of sexual appetites and anatomies, particularly
those of the African female. [Sexologists drew on fantasies of black
female embodiment as their model of sexual deviancy and gender
nonconformity. Racial comparative-anatomy methods were used to determine
sexual definition, with a presumed similitude between "deviant" white
bodies and the black body]{.underline}. The word homosexual itself
seemed to conjure some anxieties about miscegenation, as the
"barbarously hybrid word" was a mix of Latin and Greek, even referring
to "shades of gender" and "sexual half-breeds." 14 Reading Marriott in
the context of feminist and queer theory offers new insight into the
gendered and sexualized nature of blackness's ontological negation,
particularly the nonheteronormativity of race's reproduction. [The
[negation of blackness is the foundation of ethics and
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, even [[of modern sociality itself; this
negation overdetermines black practices as criminal, queer, nationally
polluting, and pathological]{.underline}.]{.mark}15

### Black Nihilism

#### The alternative is black nihilism \-\-- refusing political hope is the only metaphysically coherent response to the constant slaughter of black bodies 

**Warren 15** \[Calvin K., Assistant Professor of American Studies at
George Washington University, "Black Nihilism and the Politics of Hope,"
*CR: The New Centennial Review*, Volume 15, Number 1, Spring 2015\]

V. Conclusion Throughout this essay, I have argued that the Politics of
hope preserve metaphysical structures that sustain black suffering. This
preservation amounts to an exploitation of hope---when the Political
colonizes the spiritual principle of hope and puts it in the service of
extending the "will to power" of an anti-black organization of
existence. The Politics of hope, then, is bound up with metaphysical
violence, and this violence masquerades as a "solution" to the problem
of anti-blackness. [Temporal linearity, perfection, betterment,
struggle, work, and utopian futurity are [conceptual instruments of the
Political]{.mark} that [will never obviate black suffering or anti-black
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}[; [these]{.underline}]{.mark} [concepts
only serve to [reproduce the conditions that **render existence
unbearable for blacks**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Political theologians
and black optimists avoid the immediacy of black
suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}, the horror of anti-black pulverization,
[[and]{.underline} [place relief in a]{.underline}]{.mark}
"not-yet-but-is (maybe)-to-come-[[social order]{.underline}"
[that]{.underline},]{.mark} itself, [[can do little more but admonish
blacks to survive to keep struggling]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Political
[hope becomes a vicious and abusive cycle]{.mark} of
struggle]{.underline}---it mirrors the Lacanian drive, and we encircle
an object (black freedom, justice, relief, redress, equality, etc.) that
is inaccessible because it doesn't really exist[. The political
theologian and black optimist]{.underline}, then, [propose a collective
Jouissance as an answer to black suffering]{.underline}---[finding the
joy in struggle]{.underline}, the victory in toil, and the satisfaction
in inefficacious action. **[[We continue to "struggle" and "work" as
black youth are slaughtered daily, black bodies are incarcerated as
forms of capital, black infant mortality rates are soaring, and hunger
is disabling the bodies, minds, and spirits of desperate black
youth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In short, [these conditions are [deep
metaphysical problems]{.mark}]{.underline}---the sadistic pleasure of
metaphysical domination---and "[work[" and "struggle" avoid the
terrifying fact that **the world depends on black death to sustain
itself**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Black nihilism attempts to break this
"drive"]{.underline}]{.mark}---to stop it in its tracks, as it
were---[and to end the cycle of insanity that political hope
perpetuates. The question that remains is a question often put to the
black nihilist: [what is the point?]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[This
compulsory geometrical structuring of thought---[all knowledge must
submit to, and is reducible to, a point]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[it is
an epistemic flicker of certainty, determination, and, to put it
bluntly, life.]{.underline} "[The point" exists for life; it enlivens,
enables, and sustains knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thought outside of
this mandatory point is illegible and useless. [[To write outside of the
"episteme of life" and its grammar will require a position outside of
this point]{.mark}, a position somewhere in the infinite horizon of
thought]{.underline} (perhaps this is what Heidegger wanted to do with
his reconfiguration of thought). Writing in this way is inherently
subversive and refuses the geometry of thought. Nevertheless, the \[End
Page 243\] nihilist is forced to enunciate his refusal through a
"point," a point that is contradictory and paradoxical all at once. To
say that the point of this essay is that "the point" is fraudulent---its
promise of clarity and life are inadequate---will not satisfy the hunger
of disciplining the nihilist and insisting that one undermine the very
ground upon which one stands. [[Black nihilistic hermeneutics resists
"the point]{.mark}" but is subjected to it to have one's voice heard
within the marketplace of ideas. [The "point" of this essay is that
**political hope is pointless**. Black suffering is an essential part of
the world, and **placing hope in the very structure that sustains
metaphysical violence**, the Political, **will never resolve
anything**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why the black nihilist speaks
of "exploited hope," and [the]{.underline} [[black nihilist attempts to
**wrest hope from the clutches of the Political**]{.underline}. [**Can
we think of hope outside the Political?** Must "salvation" translate
into a **political grammar** or a political program? **The
nihilist**]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[**hopes for the end of
political hope** and its metaphysical violence.]{.underline} **[Nihilism
is not antithetical to hope; it does not extinguish hope but
reconfigures it. Hope is the foundation of the black nihilistic
hermeneutic]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In "Blackness and Nothingness," Fred
[Moten]{.underline} (2013) [conceptualizes blackness as a "pathogen" to
metaphysics]{.underline}, [something that has the ability to unravel, to
disable, and to destroy anti-blackness]{.underline}. If we read Vattimo
through Moten's brilliant analysis, we can suggest that **[blackness is
the limit that Heidegger and Nietzsche were really after]{.underline}**.
[It is a "blackened" world that will ultimately end metaphysics, but
putting an end to metaphysics will also put an end to the world
itself---this is the nihilism that the black nihilist must theorize
through]{.underline}. **[This is a far cry from]{.underline}** what we
call "**[anarchy]{.underline}**," however. The black nihilist has as
little faith in the metaphysical reorganization of society through
anarchy than he does in traditional forms of political existence. The
black nihilist offers political apostasy as the spiritual practice of
denouncing metaphysical violence, black suffering, and the idol of
anti-blackness. [[The act of renouncing will not change political
structures or offer a political program]{.underline}; instead, [it is
the act of **retrieving the spiritual concept of hope from the captivity
of the Political**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Ultimately, [it
is impossible to end metaphysics without ending blackness, and [the
**black nihilist will never be able to withdraw from the Political
completely without a certain death-drive or
being-toward-death**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is the **essence of
black suffering**]{.underline}: [the lack of reprieve from
metaphysics]{.underline}, [the **tormenting complicity** in the
reproduction of violence]{.underline}, [and the **lack of a coherent
grammar to articulate these dilemmas**]{.underline}. After contemplating
these issues for some time in my office, I decided to take a train home.
As I awaited my train in the station, an older black woman asked me
about the train schedule and when I would expect the next train headed
toward Dupont Circle. When I told her the trains were running slowly,
she began to talk about the government shutdown. "[They don't care
anything about us, you know,]{.underline}" she said. "[We elect these
people into office, we vote for them, and they watch black people suffer
and have no intentions of doing anything about it]{.underline}." I shook
my head in agreement and listened intently. "[I'm going to stop
voting]{.underline}, and supporting this process; [why should I keep
doing this and our people continue to suffer]{.underline}," she said.
[I]{.underline} looked at her and [said, "I don't know ma'am; I just
don't understand it myself." She then laughed and thanked me for
listening to her---as if our conversation were somewhat cathartic. "You
know, people think you're crazy when you say things like
this,"]{.underline} she said giving me a wink. "Yes they do," I said.
"But I am a free woman," she emphasized "and I won't go back." Shocked,
I smiled at her, and she winked at me; at that moment I realized that
[her wisdom and courage penetrated my mind and demanded
answers]{.underline}. I've thought about this conversation for some
time, and it is for this reason I had to write this essay. [To the brave
woman at the train station, I must say [you are not crazy]{.mark} at all
but [thinking **outside of metaphysical time, space, and violence**.
**Ultimately, we must hope for the end of political
hope**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Maximum Captivity

#### We must theorize slavery as maximum captivity in order to produce a structural analysis capable to think of the resistance necessary to disrupt that system. 

**Sexton 8** (Jared Sexton, Director of African American Studies at UC
Irvine, 2008, "Amalgamation Schemes: Antiblackness and the Critique of
Multiracialism", pages 111-114)

FYI: Randall Kennedy is "one of the first black scholars in this
generation to pen a sustained argument advocating what he terms 'a
cosmopolitan ethos that welcomes the prospect of genuine, loving
interracial intimacy' " (page 107-108)

In response to the last question, we examine several comments from
Kennedy's opening chapter, "In the Age of Slavery." As noted,
[[Kennedy]{.mark} is at [pains to counter the claims of]{.mark}
a]{.underline} certain [black feminist history regarding
the]{.underline} "extremity of power" exercised by the slaveholder and
"[the [absolute submission required of the slave]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(Hartman, quoted in Kennedy 2003, 532fn11). [He is]{.underline}, in
other words, [attempting to demonstrate]{.underline}, or at least to
speculate upon, [the limits of the slave system's power of domination.
Beyond this limit---whose locus proves frustratingly obscure---the
agency of the slave herself was, we are told, able to affect
significantly the conditions of captivity to alternate ends.
**[Kennedy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in other words, **[[proffers a
narrative]{.mark} in which]{.underline}** evidence of agency (evidence,
that is, confirming **[an assumption [of agency]{.mark}]{.underline}**),
**[however circumscribed or practically ineffective, is taken
[as]{.mark} a sign of [resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More properly,
[this is a narrative of resistant affection, an insistence that the
dehumanizing social order of racial slavery was unable to achieve its
ultimate goal---"the absolute submission of the slave"---because it
could not overcome the irresistible force of affection between men and
women, "regardless of color."]{.underline} When all is said and done[, a
human is still a human]{.underline}, as it were, [and the family romance
of normative heterosexuality persists "even within" hierarchies that
preclude for the captive all of the recognizable]{.underline} (social,
political, economic, cultural, legal) [trappings of "human being" in the
modern sense. Here is Kennedy: [The slave system
failed]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, to perfect the domination that \[
Judge Thomas\] Ruffin envisioned. It failed [[to bind the slaves so
tightly as to deprive them of all room to maneuver]{.underline}]{.mark}.
It failed to wring from them all prohibited yearnings. Slavery was, to
be sure, a horribly oppressive system that severely restricted the ambit
within which its victims could make decisions. But slavery did not
extinguish altogether the possibility of choice. (43) [[We might ask,
**what is the minimum ambit of decision making**]{.underline}]{.mark}?
**[[What sort of system, if not slavery, would bind one so tightly as to
deprive one of all "room to maneuver]{.underline}]{.mark}**"? **[[Need a
system]{.mark} of domination [be "perfect"]{.mark} in order [for it to
be]{.mark} legally binding or socially [effective or politically
determinant]{.mark}]{.underline}**? **[[Need the captive body be
deprived of all room to maneuver]{.mark} for the situation to be
considered one of extremity]{.underline}**? [**[Need the yearnings of
slaves be wrung entirely from them for their prohibition to be
considered a constitutive element of life]{.underline}**?]{.mark} **[At
what point does the quantitative measure of the slave's bondage become
difference of a qualitative sort]{.underline}**? **[[What precisely is
the "choice" available under slavery, and is it one worthy of
belaboring, one whose sphere of influence is to be considered
newsworthy]{.underline}]{.mark}**? To put a finer point on it, why is
**[[the categorical discrepancy refused between]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the free and the enslaved, or more specifically, between [[the slave and
the slaveholder]{.underline}]{.mark}? **[[Is]{.underline}]{.mark}** such
refusal not **[[tantamount to denying the very existence of slavery as a
system that produced slaves rather than free people whose freedom was
simply "severely restricted"]{.mark} or whose power was simply "severely
limited" [or who simply faced "difficult
situations]{.mark}]{.underline}**"? Kennedy continues: Bondage severely
limited the power---including the sexual power---of slaves. But it did
not wholly erase their capacity to attract and shape affectionate,
erotic attachments of all sorts, including interracial ones. In a
hard-to-quantify but substantial number of cases, feelings of affection
and attachment between white male masters and their black female slaves
somehow survived slavery's deadening influence. The great difficulty, in
any particular instance, lies in determining whether sex between a male
master and a female slave was an expression of sexual autonomy or an act
of unwanted sex. The truth is that most often we cannot know for sure,
since there exists little direct testimony from those involved,
especially the enslaved women. (44) [The inability to
quantify]{.underline} the "number of cases" or, indeed, [to "know for
sure" anything about them]{.underline} does not prevent the author from
considering them nonetheless "substantial," [and the paucity of direct
testimony,6 "especially \[from\] the enslaved women," does not stop the
author from extrapolating wildly]{.underline} about said "feelings of
affection and attachment" between them and their "white male masters."
In fact, it is the void in its place---the great historic
silence---[that enables both the reiteration of longstanding alibis for
white male sexual violence]{.underline}---what Hartman (1997) discusses
skillfully as the "ruses of seduction"---[and the projection of this
newfangled, though no less menacing, **story about a maverick
interracial intimacy that**, almost undetectably, **undermines the
injunctions of white supremacy, serving not only as a sign of agency for
enslaved women but a moment of their resistance as well**. Their "sexual
power" is expressed as the "capacity to attract"---and "somehow" to
manipulate---the erotic attachments of white male slaveholders. There is
here an unsubtle shift in terms]{.underline}: [[agency is not in itself
subversive]{.underline}]{.mark}; indeed, the entire slave system
derives, in large part, from the agency of the enslaved (its capture,
manipulation, redeployment, etc.) (Chandler 2000). [[Agency may be
resistant or complicit or both]{.mark}, and it may or may not have
practical effects in the world**; [all of this can only be determined
contextually]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Much more troubling]{.underline} than
Kennedy's imprecision here, however, [is]{.underline} his entirely
[uncritical suggestion about the "sexual power" of slaves**. Is not one
of the principal conceits of power to suggest that though the dominant
may monopolize power**]{.underline} political, economic, and social,
**[the dominated nonetheless enjoy a wily aptitude for "getting their
way" by other means, namely]{.underline}**, the ars erotica of
**[seduction]{.underline}**? [Is not one of the most pernicious elements
of the proslavery discourse that the "attractiveness" of enslaved black
women presents a threat of corruption to civilized white manhood
and]{.underline}/or [an internal guarantee against the excesses of
state-sanctioned violence reserved for white slaveholders]{.underline}?
**[The same quality that served as temptation was also]{.underline}**,
or alternately, taken to be that which would forestall the descent of
slaveholding into unrestrained brutality, [**an essential
rationalization for the upholding of white (male) impunity toward
blacks**, whether enslaved or nominally "free"]{.underline} (Hartman
1997).7 Finally, **[was not the suggestion that enslaved black men might
have the power to seduce white women]{.underline}** (whether free or, in
earlier periods, indentured) **[one of the prime alibis for the
construction of regulatory or prohibitory statutes around interracial
marriage and sexual relations from the seventeenth century
onward]{.underline}** (Bardaglio 1999)? **[In each case, [the focus on
the]{.mark} "sexual [power" of slaves was undoubtedly a displacement of
the organized violence consistently required of captivity]{.mark} and,
further, a dissimulation of the institutionalized sexual power of
slaveholders in particular]{.underline}** (whose authority not only
foreclosed the possibility of prosecution and militated against the
extralegal reprisals but also contributed immeasurably to their
"capacity to attract and shape affectionate, erotic attachments of all
kinds." **[The asymmetry here approaches the incommensurable---how,
after all, would a slave go on to "court" a master? How would such an
exercise in self-objectification, supplementing structural availability
with an affirmation of "willingness," rightly be called
power?).]{.underline}** [This is no less the case simply because for
Kennedy]{.underline} [the "sexual power" of slaves is something to honor
or celebrate rather than to fear]{.underline}.

### Pathology

#### Only a refusal to create a distance from the pathology of blackness, to work inside of it can produce the end of the world, and therefore sociality. 

**Sexton 10** (Jared Sexton, Director, African American Studies School
of Humanities , Associate Professor, African American Studies School of
Humanities, Associate Professor, Film & Media Studies School of
Humanities at University of California Irvine, "The Social Life of
Social Death: On Afro-Pessimism and Black Optimism")

What I find most intriguing about the timbre of the argument of "The
Case of Blackness," and the black optimism it articulates against a
certain construal of afro-pessimism, is the way that [[it works away
from a discourse of black pathology only to swerve right back into it as
an ascription to those found to be taking up and holding themselves in
"the stance of the pathologist" in relation to black
folks]{.underline}]{.mark}. I say this not only because there is, in
this version of events, a recourse to psychoanalytic terminology
("fetishization," "obsession," "repetition,"), but also because [there
is at the heart of the matter a rhetorical question that
establishes]{.underline} both the bad advice of a wild analysis and [a
tacit diagnosis affording a certain speaker's benefit: "So why is it
repressed?" The "it" that has been afflicted by the psychopathology of
obsessional neurosis is the understanding, which is also to say the
celebration, of the ontological priority or previousness of blackness
relative to the antiblackness that establishes itself against it, a
priority or previousness that is also termed "knowledge of
freedom]{.underline}" or, pace Chandler, comprehension of "the
constitutive force of the African American subject(s)" (Chandler 2000:
261). \[21[\] [What does not occur here is a consideration of the
possibility that something might be unfolding in the project or
projections of afro-pessimism "knowing full well the danger of a kind of
negative reification" associated with its analytical claims to the
paradigmatic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Moten 2004: 279). That is to say,
**[it might just be the case that an object lesson in the phenomenology
of the thing is a gratuity that folds a new encounter into older habits
of thought through a reinscription of (black) pathology that reassigns
its cause and relocates its source without ever really getting inside
it]{.underline}**. In a way, [what we're talking about
relates]{.underline} not to a disagreement about "unthought positions"
(and their de-formation) but [to a disagreement, or discrepancy, about
"unthought dispositions]{.underline}" (and their in-formation). I would
maintain this insofar as [the misrecognition at work]{.underline} in the
reading of that motley crew listed in the ninth footnote
[regards]{.underline}, perhaps ironically, [the performative dimension
or signifying aspect of a "generalized impropriety" so improper as to
appear as the same old propriety returning through the back
door]{.underline}. Without sufficient consideration of the gap between
statement and enunciation here, to say nothing of quaint notions like
context or audience or historical conjuncture, the discourse of
afro-pessimism, even as it approaches otherwise important questions, can
only seem like a "tragically neurotic" instance of "certain discourse on
the relation between blackness and death" (Moten 2007: 9).xiii Fanon and
his interlocutors, or what appear rather as his fateful adherents, would
seem to have a problem embracing black social life because they never
really come to believe in it, because they cannot acknowledge the social
life from which they speak and of which they speak---as negation and
impossibility---as their own (Moten 2008: 192). Another way of putting
this might be to say that they are caught in a performative
contradiction enabled by disavowal. I wonder, however, whether things
are even this clear in Fanon and the readings his writing might
facilitate. Lewis Gordon's sustained engagement finds Fanon situated in
an ethical stance grounded in the affirmation of blackness in the
historic antiblack world. In a response to the discourse of
multiracialism emergent in the late twentieth-century United States, for
instance, Gordon writes, following Fanon, that "there is no way to
reject the thesis that there is something wrong with being black beyond
the willingness to 'be' black -- in terms of convenient fads of playing
blackness, but in paying the costs of antiblackness on a global scale.
Against the raceless credo, then, racism cannot be rejected without a
dialectic in which humanity experiences a blackened world" (Gordon 1997:
67). What is this willingness to 'be' black, of choosing to be black
affirmatively rather than reluctantly, that Gordon finds as the key
ethical moment in Fanon? \[23\] Elsewhere, in a discussion of Du Bois on
the study of black folk, Gordon restates an existential phenomenological
conception of the antiblack world developed across his first several
books: "Blacks here suffer the phobogenic reality posed by the spirit of
racial seriousness. In effect, they more than symbolize or signify
various social pathologies---they become them. In our antiblack world,
blacks are pathology" (Gordon 2000: 87). [[This conception would seem to
support Moten's contention that even much radical black studies
scholarship sustains the association of blackness with a certain sense
of decay and thereby fortifies and extends the interlocutory life of
widely accepted political common sense.]{.mark} In fact, it would seem
that Gordon deepens the already problematic association to the level of
identity. [And yet, this is precisely what Gordon argues is the value
and insight of Fanon: he fully accepts the definition of himself as
pathological as it is imposed by a world that knows itself through that
imposition, rather than remaining in a reactive stance that insists on
the]{.mark}]{.underline} (temporal, moral, etc.) [[heterogeneity between
a self and an imago originating in culture.]{.mark} [Though it may
appear counterintuitive, or rather because it is counterintuitive, this
acceptance or affirmation is active; it is a willing or willingness, in
other words, to pay whatever social costs accrue to being black, to
inhabiting blackness, to living a black social life under the shadow of
social death. This is not an accommodation to the dictates of the
antiblack world. **The affirmation of blackness, which is to say an
affirmation of pathological being, is a refusal to distance oneself from
blackness in a valorization of minor differences that bring one closer
to health, to life, or to sociality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fanon writes
in the first chapter of Black Skin, White Masks, "The Black Man and
Language": "A Senegalese who learns Creole to pass for Antillean is a
case of alienation. The Antilleans who make a mockery out of him are
lacking in judgment" (Fanon 2008: 21). In a world structured by the twin
axioms of white superiority and black inferiority, of white existence
and black nonexistence, a world structured by a negative categorical
imperative---"above all, don't be black" (Gordon 1997: 63)---in this
world, the zero degree of transformation is the turn toward blackness, a
turn toward the shame, as it were, that "resides in the idea that 'I am
thought of as less than human'" (Nyong'o 2002: 389).xiv [In this we
might create a transvaluation of pathology itself, something like an
embrace of pathology without pathos]{.underline}.

### Burn it Down

#### We must burn civil society to the ground - there is no up from slavery. From segregation to neosegregation, the end of the 1AC's progress is only the perfection of the slave - The legal system becomes the plantation, and we must kill it. 

**Farley '05** (Anthony Paul, Professor of Law @ Boston College,
"Perfecting Slavery", 1/27/2005,

--) NN

[What is to be done? Two hundred years ago, [when the slaves]{.mark} in
Haiti [rose up,]{.mark} they, of necessity, [burned
everything]{.mark}:]{.underline} They burned San Domingo flat so that at
the end of the war it was a charred desert. [Why do you burn
everything?]{.underline} asked a French officer of a prisoner. [We have
[a right to burn what]{.mark} we [cultivate because]{.mark} a man has a
[right to dispose of]{.mark} his [own labour]{.mark}, was the reply of
this unknown anarchist. [The slaves burned everything because everything
was against them.]{.mark} Everything was against the slaves, the entire
order that it was their lot to follow, the entire order in which they
were positioned as worse than senseless things, every plantation,
everything.]{.underline} "Leave nothing white behind you," said
Toussaint to those dedicated to the end of white-over black. "God gave
Noah the rainbow sign. No more water, the fire next time." [The slaves
burned everything, yes, but, unfortunately, they only burned everything
in Haiti. [Theirs was the greatest]{.mark} and most successful
[revolution in the history of the world but the failure of their fire to
cross the waters was]{.mark} the great [tragedy]{.mark} of the
nineteenth century.]{.underline} At the dawn of the twentieth century,
W.E.B. Du Bois wrote, "The colorline belts the world." Du Bois said that
the problem of the twentieth century was the problem of the colorline.
[The problem, now, at the dawn of the twenty-first century is the
problem of the colorline. The colorline continues to belt the world.
Indeed, [the slave power that is the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [now
threatens an entire world]{.mark} with the death that it has become and
so the slaves of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, [those with nothing but
their chains to lose,]{.mark} must, if they would be free, if [they
would escape slavery, win the entire world]{.mark}.]{.underline} We
begin as children. We are called and we become our response to the call.
[Slaves are not called. What becomes of them? What becomes of the
broken-hearted? The slaves are divided souls, they are brokenhearted,
the slaves are split asunder by what they are called upon to
become.]{.underline} The slaves are called upon to become objects but
objecthood is not a calling. [The slave, then, during its loneliest
loneliness, is divided from itself. This is schizophrenia.]{.underline}
The slaves are not called, or, rather, the slaves are called to not be.
The slaves are called unfree but this the living can never be and so the
slaves burst apart and die. [The slaves begin as death, not as children,
and death is not a beginning but an end.]{.underline} **[[There is no
progress and no exit from the undiscovered country of the slave,]{.mark}
or so it seems.]{.underline}** [We are trained to think through a
progress narrative, a grand narrative, the grandest narrative, that
takes us up from slavery. There is no up from slavery. [The progress
from slavery to the end of history is the progress from white-over-black
to white-over-black]{.mark} to white-overblack. The progress of [slavery
runs in the opposite direction of the]{.mark} past present future
[timeline]{.mark}.]{.underline} The slave only becomes the perfect slave
at the end of the timeline, only under conditions of total juridical
freedom. [It is [only under conditions of freedom,]{.mark} of bourgeois
legality, [that the slave]{.mark} can [perfect itself]{.mark} as a slave
[by *freely choosing* to bow down before its master.]{.mark} The slave
perfects itself as a slave [by offering a prayer for equal
rights]{.mark}. [The system of marks]{.mark} is a plantation. The system
[of property]{.mark} is a plantation. The system [of law is a
plantation. These]{.mark} plantations, all part of the same system,
*hierarchy*, [produce white-overblack]{.mark}, white-over-black only,
and that [continually]{.mark}.]{.underline} The slave perfects itself as
a slave through its prayers for equal rights. [The plantation system
will not commit suicide and the slave, as stated above, has knowing
non-knowledge of this fact.]{.underline} **[[The slave finds its way
back from the undiscovered country only by burning down every
plantation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When the slave prays for equal rights
it makes the free choice to be dead, and it makes the free choice to not
be. Education is the call. We are called to be and then we become
something. We become that which we make of ourselves. We follow the
call, we pursue a calling. [Freedom is the only calling---it alone
contains all possible directions, all of the choices that may later
blossom into the fullness of our lives. We can only be free. Slavery is
death. How do slaves die? Slaves are not born, they are
made.]{.underline} The slave must be trained to be that which the living
cannot be. The only thing that the living are not free to be is dead.
The slave must be trained to follow the call that is not a call. The
slave must be trained to pursue the calling that is not a calling. The
slave must be trained to objecthood. [[The slave must become
death.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Slavery is white-over-black.
White-over-black is death. [White-over-black, death, then, is what the
slave must become to pursue its calling that is not a
calling.]{.mark}]{.underline}
