**Chase 19.** \[Michael S. Chase, Senior Political Scientist, RAND
Corporation, Averting a Cross-Strait Crisis,
<https://www.cfr.org/report/averting-cross-strait-crisis>\]

**[The risk of a serious crisis between China and Taiwan is
growing]{.underline}**. [Cross-strait relations have chilled in recent
years]{.underline} as a result of [the unwillingness of]{.underline}
Taiwan's President Tsai [Ing-wen to embrace the]{.underline} so-called
[1992 Consensus]{.underline}---an understanding that was [the basis for
a warmer relationship between Beijing and Taipei]{.underline} under
Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT). According to
the KMT, the 1992 Consensus holds that both mainland China and Taiwan
belong to "one China" but with distinct interpretations. **[Beijing's
stance]{.underline}**, however, **[is]{.underline}** that the 1992
Consensus means **[there is "one China,"]{.underline}** which is the
People's Republic of China (PRC), and [that Taiwan is part of the
PRC]{.underline}. [China responded to Tsai's refusal]{.underline} to
endorse its approach to the 1992 Consensus [by]{.underline}
**[implementing a multifaceted pressure campaign to punish and coerce
Taiwan]{.underline}** into being more compliant. **[Beijing's tactics
have included suspending official]{.underline}** [and
semiofficial]{.underline} **[mechanisms for]{.underline}** cross-strait
**[communications]{.underline}**, reducing the number of mainland
tourists allowed to visit Taiwan, **[pressuring countries that recognize
Taiwan to sever diplomatic relations with the island]{.underline}**,
**[and conducting military exercises and information operations designed
to intimidate Taiwan.]{.underline}**

**[This]{.underline}** pressure **[campaign could intensify in the next
twelve]{.underline}** to eighteen
**[months]{.underline}**---[particularly in the lead-up to and
immediately following Taiwan's 2020 presidential
election]{.underline}---**[to the extent that it triggers a new
cross-strait crisis]{.underline}**. Although the United States maintains
a "one China" policy in accordance with the three U.S.-China joint
communiques and withdrew from its 1954 defense treaty with Taiwan after
establishing diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1979, [such a crisis
would clearly affect U.S. national security interests]{.underline}.

Taiwan and the United States maintain an unofficial relationship, but
the island is an important U.S. economic and security partner that
shares democratic values. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act holds that U.S.
policy is "to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by
other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat
to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave
concern to the United States." Given its long-standing commitments to
the security of Taiwan and its broader economic, diplomatic, and
security interests in the Indo-Pacific, **[the United States would
almost certainly become embroiled in a new cross-strait
crisis]{.underline}**. **[The United States should be
attentive]{.underline}**, therefore, to the potential direction of
events **[and take steps to help avert]{.underline}** and, if necessary,
mitigate **[a new cross-strait confrontation]{.underline}**.

#### Guaranteed US draw-in bears down on the possibility of strong US-China relations. Chinese distrust over Taiwan is the only scenario for East Asian escalation. 

**Chase 19.** \[Michael S. Chase, Senior Political Scientist, RAND
Corporation, Averting a Cross-Strait Crisis,
<https://www.cfr.org/report/averting-cross-strait-crisis>\]

[Various warning indicators are associated with]{.underline} each of the
three contributing developments to [a]{.underline} [cross-strait
crisis]{.underline} discussed above. For domestic developments in
Taiwan, **[the most obvious relate to Tsai's statements]{.underline}**,
**[the approval ratings of the DPP ahead of the next elections, changing
public opinion]{.underline}** (particularly [in relation to
China]{.underline}), and [the emergence of a more pro-independence DPP
candidate]{.underline} or a surprise third-party candidate ahead of the
2020 election. **[The possibility of a DPP candidate Beijing distrusts
even more than Tsai]{.underline}**, or of a three-way race for the
presidency in 2020, **[could create unpredictable
dynamics]{.underline}**.

The warning indicator associated with Beijing's desire to ramp up the
pressure campaign against Taipei would be sharper rhetoric from Xi,
which could indicate impatience with Taiwan or serve as a warning that
there could be consequences if Beijing perceives Taipei as politically
moving further away from the mainland. [Xi could signal an impending
increase in pressure by using new language suggesting urgency about
Taiwan]{.underline}, such as **[setting an explicit timetable for
unification]{.underline}**. Alternatively, he could repeat his previous
statement suggesting that the issue of Taiwan should not be passed down
"from generation to generation," or his earlier warning that if the
foundation of the cross-strait relationship erodes "the earth will move,
and the mountains will shake." Although a surprise attack by China is
extremely unlikely, Xi could also attempt to send a message to Taiwan
and the United States by highlighting the PLA's preparedness for
conflict across the Taiwan Strait. For example, Xi could declare the
ongoing PLA reforms and reorganization a *success*. [China
is]{.underline} undoubtedly [aware that]{.underline} some [observers
suspect the PLA would not be ready for a major conflict in the short
term because of]{.underline} the ongoing [restructuring]{.underline}, so
[signaling that the PLA is ready]{.underline} (or that it would be by
2020) **[could be a seen as a warning]{.underline}**.

Changes in U.S. policy or a further deterioration of the U.S.-China
relationship could also provide warning indicators. If the United States
were to take action that suggests it could fundamentally redefine its
policy toward Taiwan or abandon its long-standing "one China" policy,
China would likely respond strongly. Short of such a dramatic alteration
to U.S. policy, [if Washington proceeds with actions that Beijing sees
as emboldening]{.underline} leaders in [Taipei]{.underline} to reject
the mainland's demands or to move further in a direction that China
views as antithetical to its interests, [the risk of a cross-strait
crisis could increase]{.underline}. For example, China strongly objected
to the 2018 Taiwan Travel Act, which states that Congress believes it
should be U.S. policy to allow U.S. officials at all levels to visit
Taiwan. Chinese commentators have also expressed concern about calls for
Taiwan to be invited to participate in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC)
military exercise and for U.S. Navy vessels to make port calls in
Taiwan. **[A high-profile arms sale to Taiwan]{.underline}** that
included cutting-edge hardware such as F-35 fighters or submarines could
also raise tensions with China. Additionally, a sharp downturn in the
U.S.-China relationship over other issues, such as trade or the South
China Sea, **[could make a cross-strait crisis more likely by hardening
Chinese perceptions that the United States is intent on containing
China]{.underline}** and wishes to play the Taiwan card to check China's
rise more broadly.

If China decides, for whatever reason, to ramp up pressure on Taiwan,
there would likely be additional signals including leadership statements
that criticize specific actions by Taiwan or the United States, harsh
condemnations of pro-independence politicians in Taiwan in various media
outlets, and other moves to prepare the public for a confrontation. In
addition, some tactical indicators might be observable shortly before
China increases the pressure on Taiwan. These signs could include
unusual activity by Chinese military units, intensified intelligence
operations against Taiwan, or heightened levels of Chinese computer
espionage against political parties or election-related targets in
Taiwan.

[Implications for U.S. Interests]{.underline}

[A cross-strait crisis in the run-up to Taiwan's 2020
elections]{.underline} or shortly after [would present]{.underline}
[serious risks to U.S. interests]{.underline}.

**[At a minimum]{.underline}**, [a cross-strait crisis could result
in]{.underline} **[a broader freeze in U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}**, [which could complicate other important
issues]{.underline}---**[regionally and globally]{.underline}**---**[in
the relationship]{.underline}**. For example, **[it could exacerbate
tensions]{.underline}** **[in other areas where there is
already]{.underline}** considerable **[friction]{.underline}** (e.g.,
[maritime disputes]{.underline} [in the South China Sea]{.underline})
**[or imperil cooperation on other issues of concern]{.underline}**
(e.g., **[North Korean denuclearization]{.underline}**), at least
temporarily. A successful pressure campaign could embolden China to
apply similar tactics elsewhere. For example, if the Chinese government
successfully intensified its interference in Taiwan's elections (e.g.,
manipulating social media, covert financing of preferred candidates, or
hacking and releasing emails or other data), it could try to apply the
same or similar tactics elsewhere.

**[The consequences for U.S.-China relations could be
severe]{.underline}**.

A **[crisis could]{.underline}** also **[fundamentally damage U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}** and the overall U.S. posture in the
Indo-Pacific. This scenario could play out differently depending on how
the United States reacts and how its reaction is perceived by other
actors in the region. Particularly if the U.S.-China relationship
continues to be characterized by friction over trade and security
issues, **[a concerted U.S. effort to push back on Chinese pressure
could convince Beijing that Washington views Taipei as]{.underline}** a
useful **[part of a containment strategy]{.underline}**. On the one
hand, **[the consequences for U.S.-China relations could be severe,
potentially solidifying a more adversarial relationship
overall]{.underline}**, but U.S. allies and partners might be reassured
by a demonstration of Washington's willingness and ability to stand up
to Beijing. On the other hand, if the United States fails to help Taiwan
respond to escalating Chinese pressure tactics or if the United States
responds but is unable to stop China, other U.S. allies and partners in
the Indo-Pacific---in particular Japan and South Korea---might see the
United States as lacking in resolve or in capability. This scenario
could increase their concerns about Washington's reliability and
predictability, and cast doubt on the credibility of U.S. commitments in
the region and beyond---all of which would undermine Washington's
ability to implement national security and national defense strategies
that rely on cooperation with allies and partners.

#### Nationalist pressure and nuclear insecurity make the risk of war high and nuclear escalation probable

**Glaser 15**. \[Charles L Glaser is a professor in the Elliott School
of International Affairs and the Department of Political Science at
George Washington University. He is also a fellow in the Kissinger
Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ("A
U.S.-China Grand Bargain?" International Security, Vol. 39, No. 4
(Spring 2015), pp. 49--90, doi:10.1162/ISEC_a_00199\]

[Although a number of regional sovereignty and maritime disputes have
the potential to sour the U.S.-China relationship and draw the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [into]{.underline} crises that
could escalate into [larger wars]{.underline}, [the **key danger**
appears to be Taiwan's status]{.underline}. [China has long made clear
that it considers unification a paramount political and national
security goal]{.underline}.62 In contrast, at least until recently, [the
disputes in the South China and East China Seas seemed to be of
**secondary** importance, with the sovereignty disputes concerning
islets and very small islands that are strategically unimportant and
have uncertain]{.underline} and negotiable [economic value]{.underline}.
The escalating troubles in the South China and East China Seas arguably
reduce the special importance of Taiwan and weaken the case for
accommodation, which I address in a later section.

[The most direct benefit of ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan would
be a reduction in the probability of war between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China over Taiwan's status]{.underline}.
Current U.S. policy is designed to prevent Taiwan from declaring
independence and to make clear that the United States will not come to
Taiwan's aid if it does. Nevertheless, the United States will find
itself under pressure to protect Taiwan no matter what the source of a
Chinese attack. Whether Taiwan provoked an attack might be unclear,
which would increase pressure for U.S. involvement. Moreover, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has limited control over
Taiwan's policy, which puts it in the unfortunate position of being
**hostage to decisions made in Taipei**]{.underline}.

None of the above dangers is new, but others are. [China's improved
military capabilities may increase its willingness both to start and to
escalate a Taiwan crisis]{.underline}. [Fifteen years ago, China had
little capability to invade or blockade Taiwan. Today it can begin to
imagine successfully invading Taiwan, and its capability will only
increase with time]{.underline}.63 [Much of the concern about
China's]{.underline} so-called antiaccess/area-denial ([A2/AD) strategy
focuses on its ability to reduce the U.S. ability to come to Taiwan's
aid]{.underline}.64 In addition to its improved conventional
capabilities, [China is modernizing its nuclear forces to increase their
survivability]{.underline} and their ability to retaliate following a
large U.S. counternuclear attack.65 Arguably, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [current ability to destroy most]{.underline} or
all [of China's nuclear force enhances its bargaining position in a
severe crisis]{.underline} or conventional war [over
Taiwan]{.underline}. [Consequently, China's nuclear modernization may
make China more willing to start a crisis, less willing to make
compromises once conflict occurs, and **more willing to
escalate.**]{.underline}

A common counterpoint to the argument above is that [China-Taiwan
relations have improved dramatically]{.underline} since 2008, so the
probability of war is low.66 This, in turn, means the expected benefits
offered by policies that would keep the United States out of a
China-Taiwan conflict have decreased. Although this argument has merit,
[it is hard to be confident that cross-strait relations will remain
good. Taiwan might again elect a more pro-independence government, or
China might ramp up pressures for unification]{.underline}.
[Jia]{.underline} Qingguo, [a professor at Peking University, recently
wrote: "\[P\]olitical pressures on the Chinese government when it comes
to Taiwan are tremendous and growing. In the past, the Chinese people
knew that China was weak and could not stop the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from selling weapons to Taiwan. Now, many believe
that China should no longer tolerate such insulting
behavior.]{.underline} Confronted with this mounting domestic pressure,
[the CCP]{.underline} \[Chinese Communist Party\] [is finding it
increasingly difficult to justify its weak responses]{.underline}."67

#### Arms sales indicate a policy of [strategic ambiguity]{.underline} that guarantees conflict

**Colby and Slocombe 16**. \[Colby is a senior fellow at the Center for
a New American Security. Mr. Slocombe was U.S. undersecretary of defense
for policy from 1994 to 2001 (Elbridge and Walter, "U.S. 'Ambiguity' on
Taiwan Is Dangerous" Wall Street Journal, 5/23,
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ambiguity-on-taiwan-is-dangerous-1464022837>\]

If China were to attack Taiwan, would American forces come to the
island's defense? It is hard to know because [the U.S. maintains a
policy of "strategic ambiguity"]{.underline} concerning how it would
respond. It's time for that to change.

The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 states only that the U.S. would regard
such an attack as of "grave concern," and only commits the U.S. to
maintaining the ability to defend the island. This is a much less firm
commitment than the U.S. offers in NATO and to allies Japan and South
Korea. But the U.S. stakes in defending a democratic Taiwan and
maintaining the credibility of the overall U.S. alliance structure are
no less significant.

[The benefits of this approach long outweighed its risks. It preserved
flexibility, was less offensive to Beijing and signaled to Taipei the
need to tread gingerly]{.underline} on sovereignty issues. Beijing
meanwhile appeared content to try honey rather than vinegar in coaxing
Taiwan toward unification.

Moreover, China lacked the military capabilities to subjugate Taiwan.
The U.S. was so dominant militarily that Beijing's only plausible course
was to tolerate the status quo.

[But]{.underline} this calculus no longer obtains. [The military balance
is shifting in Beijing's favor]{.underline}. Sources as diverse as
Taiwan's government and the RAND Corporation have publicly judged that
[within a few short years any U.S. defense of the island will be
extremely demanding. Blocking a Chinese assault will still be possible
for the U.S., but it will be harder, riskier and more costly than
before]{.underline}.

This means that [the situation is changing from one in which Beijing
would have been foolhardy to attack Taiwan to one in which it may seem
an increasingly viable option]{.underline}. [Beijing may even deem it
necessary to keep alive its ambition of uniting the island with the
mainland]{.underline}.

Polls show that Taiwan's residents overwhelmingly prefer the status quo
or independence, and fewer identify as Chinese as time goes on. Given
that there are already substantial economic links with the mainland, why
should Beijing expect support for unification to grow suddenly,
particularly in light of China's turn away from liberalization under Xi
Jinping and the discouraging example of Hong Kong?

Thus, sooner or later, [China may decide that Taiwan is very unlikely to
simply fall into its lap---and will be increasingly tempted to turn to
coercion]{.underline}.

[This emerging situation is particularly dangerous because ambiguity can
heighten the likelihood of war when military strength becomes more
evenly balanced]{.underline}. [History is replete with examples of
countries starting wars, even against much stronger powers, based on the
belief that their strength or resolve over some issue was greater than
that of their foes]{.underline}, and that their opponents wouldn't fight
at all or hard enough. [Thus Kim Il Sung invaded South Korea in
1950]{.underline}, with Soviet and Chinese support, [believing the U.S.
wouldn't come to the South's defense]{.underline}.

[Beijing could make a similar miscalculation about U.S. resolve over
Taiwan. It might well assess U.S. ambiguity as indicating that,
confronted with a tough and costly fight over Taiwan, the U.S. would
decide not to go to war or not to fight hard enough]{.underline} to
prevent Beijing from achieving its core goals.

#### It's the [most probable]{.underline} cause of nuclear war -- strategic mistrust makes escalation likely

**Lowther 13**. \[citing a CSIS report (William, Tapei Times, 3/16,
"Taiwan could spark nuclear war: report,"
<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/03/16/2003557211>\]

[Taiwan is the **most likely** potential crisis that could trigger a
nuclear war between China and the US]{.underline}, a new academic report
concludes.

"Taiwan remains the single most plausible and dangerous source of
tension and conflict between the US and China," says the 42-page report
by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS).

[Prepared by the CSIS' Project on Nuclear Issues and resulting from a
year-long study, the report emphasizes that Beijing continues to be set
on a policy to prevent Taiwan's independence]{.underline}, while at the
same time the US maintains the capability to come to Taiwan's defense.

"Although tensions across the Taiwan Strait have subsided since both
Taipei and Beijing embraced a policy of engagement in 2008, [the
situation remains combustible, complicated by rapidly diverging
cross-strait military capabilities and persistent political
disagreements]{.underline}," the report says.

In a footnote, it quotes senior fellow at the US Council on Foreign
Relations Richard Betts describing Taiwan as "the main potential
flashpoint for the US in East Asia."

The report also quotes Betts as saying that neither Beijing nor
Washington can fully control developments that might ignite a Taiwan
crisis.

"[This is a classic recipe for surprise, **miscalculation** and
**uncontrolled escalation**]{.underline}," Betts wrote in a separate
study of his own.

The CSIS study says: "For the foreseeable future Taiwan is the
contingency in which nuclear weapons would most likely become a major
factor, because the fate of the island is intertwined both with the
legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party and the reliability of US
defense commitments in the Asia-Pacific region."

Titled Nuclear Weapons and US-China Relations, the study says disputes
in the East and South China seas appear unlikely to lead to major
conflict between China and the US, but they do "provide kindling" for
potential conflict between the two nations because the disputes
implicate a number of important regional interests, including the
interests of treaty allies of the US.

The danger posed by flashpoints such as Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and
maritime demarcation disputes is magnified by the potential for
mistakes, the study says.

"[Although Beijing and Washington have agreed to a range of crisis
management mechanisms, such as the Military Maritime Consultative
Agreement and the establishment of a direct hotline]{.underline} between
the Pentagon and the Ministry of Defense, t[he bases for
miscommunication and misunderstanding remain and draw on deep historical
reservoirs of suspicion]{.underline}," the report says.

For example, [it says, it is unclear whether either side understands
what kinds of actions would result in a]{.underline} military or even
[nuclear response by the other party]{.underline}.

To make things worse, "[neither side seems to believe the other's
declared policies and intentions, suggesting that escalation
management]{.underline}, already a very uncertain endeavor, [could be
especially difficult]{.underline} in any conflict," it says.

Although conflict "mercifully" seems unlikely at this point, the report
concludes that "it cannot be ruled out and may become increasingly
likely if we are unwise or unlucky."

The report says: "[With both sides possessing]{.underline} and looking
set to retain formidable [nuclear weapons]{.underline} arsenals, such a
[conflict would be]{.underline} tremendously dangerous and quite
possibly [devastating.]{.underline}"

[[As China's power has grown]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent years,
[[so]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [[has]{.mark} the [**risk of war** with
the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. Under President
Xi Jinping, [[China has]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark}** its political and economic
[[pressure on **Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and built]{.mark}
**[military installations]{.mark}**]{.underline} on coral reefs in the

expansionism** will **threaten** U.S. **allies** and **influence** in

they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well.
[**Chinese** fighter **jets** have **intercepted U.S. aircraft** in the

U.S. President Donald [**[Trump]{.mark}** has [brought]{.mark}
long-**[simmering]{.mark} economic [disputes]{.mark}** [to a **rolling

A war between the two countries remains unlikely, but [[the prospect
of]{.mark} a **[military
confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}---resulting, for example, from a
Chinese campaign against Taiwan---[[no longer seems]{.underline}]{.mark}
as [[implausible]{.underline}]{.mark} as it once did. And [the [**odds**
of]{.mark} such a [**confrontation going nuclear** are **higher** than
**most**]{.mark} policymakers and **analysts
[think]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Members of China's strategic com­munity tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, [U.S. **[studies]{.mark}** of a potential **war with China**
often **[exclude nuclear weapons]{.mark}** from the analysis
entirely]{.underline}, treating them as basically irrelevant to the
course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015, Dennis Blair, the
former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, estimated the
likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere between nil
and zero."

[**[This]{.mark} assurance** [is **misguided**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
deployed [[against China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the Pentagon's]{.mark}
preferred [style of]{.mark} **conventional [warfare]{.mark}** [would be
a]{.mark} potential [**recipe** for **nuclear
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' signature [approach]{.mark} to war [has
been]{.mark} simple: punch deep into enemy territory in order [to
**rapidly** knock out the opponent's]{.mark} key [military]{.mark}
assets at minimal cost]{.underline}. But [[the]{.mark} [**Pentagon**
developed this]{.mark} formula in wars [against]{.mark} Afghanistan,

#### The plan is key---

#### US-China relations are at a crossroads---US-Taiwan military relations are the litmus test for Chinese cooperation on all other issues

**Horton 18**. \[Chris Horton, Nikkei Asian Review, Taiwan caught in
US-China diplomatic crossfire,
https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Taiwan-caught-in-US-China-diplomatic-crossfire\]

The bilateral relations between Beijing and Washington, DC are at their
worst since 1996. Today, [Taiwan is caught in the crossfire
between]{.underline} the [two]{.underline} [superpowers]{.underline} as
**[the question]{.underline}** of Taiwanese recognition **[fuels both
States' advances in the South China Sea]{.underline}**. The United
States (US) Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo reiterated that the US is not
fuelling Cold War-era tensions in the region. It remains evident that on
the surface, **[the relationship between the US and China is more based
on competition]{.underline}** [rather than cooperation]{.underline}.

This article was published by Nikkei Asia Review:

[The U.S.-China relationship is at its lowest]{.underline} point
[since]{.underline} President Bill Clinton sent aircraft carrier groups
to stop Chinese intimidation of Taiwan in [1996]{.underline}.

Today, [just as then]{.underline}, [Taiwan is caught in the
middle]{.underline} of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.

In an early November meeting with U.S. National Security Adviser John
Bolton, **[Chinese envoy]{.underline}** Yang **[Jiechi]{.underline}**
**[warned that Taiwan was Beijing\'s \"most important and sensitive\"
issue]{.underline}**. As Yang undoubtedly knows, before joining the
Trump administration, Bolton had called for steps including the
restoration of full diplomatic recognition of Taipei if China continued
its strong-arm tactics against the self-ruled democracy.

Taiwan is claimed by a Chinese government that has never ruled it and
backed by a U.S. government that does not officially recognize it. The
island occupies an awkward and uncertain position as Beijing and
Washington step up belligerent rhetoric over trade, the South China Sea
and human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Yang told Bolton that China was
adhering to a policy of \"no confrontation\" with the U.S. At a news
conference two days later, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lauded
America\'s unofficial, yet close, relationship with Taiwan after a
meeting with Yang and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe. \"Regarding
our strong ties with a democratic Taiwan, I reiterated the U.S. policy
has not changed and that we are concerned about China\'s increasing
efforts to coerce others, constraining Taiwan\'s international space,\"
Pompeo said. \"The United States is not pursuing a Cold War or
containment policy with China.\"

[Both sides are making]{.underline} such [denials at a time when the
tone of language on the U.S.-China relationship has shifted from
cooperation to competition]{.underline}. While nobody is ringing alarm
bells over the possibility of clashes between Beijing and Washington
over Taiwan, **[a miscalculation by one or more of the three parties
could hasten moves toward confrontation]{.underline}**.

\"I don\'t see an inevitable drift toward conflict,\" said Bonnie
Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies. \"It doesn\'t serve the interests of Taiwan,
China or the U.S. to enter into such a conflict, so it will only happen
if major policy errors are made by all sides.\"

Yet **[missteps are not inconceivable]{.underline}**.

Chinese leaders erroneously took Trump\'s initial talk of a trade war as
bluster, only to be caught flat-footed by his doubling down on tariffs.
And the Trump administration either did not anticipate \-- or did not
care \-- how poorly Vice President Mike Pence\'s recent criticism of a
litany of Chinese transgressions would play in Beijing.

In an October speech at the Hudson Institute in Washington, Pence set
out how the Trump administration sees China as actively hurting U.S.
interests in areas from economics to security and political
interference. He attacked Beijing for pushing Latin American nations to
sever ties with Taipei, praised Taiwan\'s role as a bastion of democracy
in Asia, and accused China of threatening U.S. companies that fail to
call the island a \"province of China\" on their websites.

Whether or not this was Pence\'s intention, **[China appears to have
determined that the U.S]{.underline}**. now **[seeks to prevent its
rise]{.underline}**.

Beijing claims that Taiwan has been Chinese \"since ancient times,\" but
the greater significance of Taiwan for Chinese strategists is its
position at the intersection of the Pacific Ocean, and the East and
South China Seas.

A successful invasion and occupation of Taiwan would greatly boost
China\'s ability to project power regionwide \-- bringing it closer to
U.S. bases in Okinawa and Guam, and creating choke points for shipping
lanes that are vital to both Japan and South Korea. It would also likely
boost domestic support for Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s increasingly
authoritarian and nationalistic government.

Washington and Taipei perceive **[China as becoming increasingly
belligerent in the region]{.underline}** \-- **[especially in the
S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea \--
**[and]{.underline}** are **[deepening ties in an increasingly public
manner.]{.underline}**

Examples of this abound. Just days after being elected president in
November 2016, Trump flouted four decades of diplomatic self-constraint
by speaking directly with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen. In
March, Trump ignored Chinese threats of reprisal and signed the Taiwan
Travel Act, which encourages official exchanges between the U.S. and
Taiwan up to the highest levels. In June, the U.S. dedicated a new \$250
million compound with more than 400 staff to serve as the American
Institute in Taiwan, its de facto embassy in Taipei. Three times this
year, the U.S. has run freedom of navigation operations in the
international waters of the Taiwan Strait. It also appears to be
normalizing sales of military hardware to the island. \"I think the
relations between Taiwan and the United States are better than before,\"
Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said in a recent interview with the
Nikkei Asian Review. \"When they see that Taiwan is being responsible
for its own defense, they are more willing to engage Taiwan than ever.\"
One of the biggest changes between Tsai\'s administration and that of
her pro-China predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, has been her emphasis on
boosting military morale and spending while signaling Taiwan\'s resolve
to defend itself in the event of Chinese military aggression. Ma
suggested in a speech this month, on the third anniversary of his
meeting with Xi, that Taiwan adopt a policy of \"three noes\" \-- not
ruling out unification with China, not supporting Taiwanese
independence, and not using force against Chinese aggression. Tsai
lambasted her predecessor\'s proposal. \"It seriously hurts Taiwan\'s
sovereignty and sends a wrong message to the international community
that Taiwan will yield to China\'s suppression at a time when China has
spared no effort to bully Taiwan,\" Tsai said. At his first news
conference in October, the new director of the American Institute in
Taiwan, Brent Christensen, reiterated U.S. support for Taiwan. \"Any
effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means
represents a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific
area and is of grave concern to the United States,\" Christensen said.
\"We are opposed to unilateral attempts to change the status quo.\"

China\'s **[Xi]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[has made annexing
Taiwan a top priority]{.underline}**.=

As well as **[rapidly upgrading Beijing\'s military
capabilities]{.underline}** during his first five years in power, **[he
has projected that power to the edge of Taiwan\'s
territory]{.underline}**. [China\'s Liaoning aircraft carrier has
circled the island and spy planes, bombers and fighter jets frequently
test Taiwanese responses]{.underline} and gather information that could
be useful in an attack.

**[Disrupting Taiwan\'s democracy also appears to have become a priority
for Xi]{.underline}**. The island\'s justice ministry has been
investigating alleged Chinese funding of opposition candidates in the
upcoming local elections that will be held on Saturday, while
[Beijing\'s army of cybersoldiers appears to be planting and amplifying
disinformation in Taiwanese social media]{.underline}.

\"Xi\'s image of himself is as the Mao Zedong of the 21st century,\"
said Willy Lam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong\'s Centre for
Chinese Studies.

\"Mao united the country but failed to get Taiwan,\" Lam said. \"If Xi
absorbs Taiwan, his place in the CCP pantheon will be elevated,\" he
said using an acronym for the Chinese Communist Party.

**[Lam]{.underline}** also **[sees a misreading of intentions by one of
the three parties as the greatest risk to peace]{.underline}**.

\"[Beijing assumes that no U.S. administration since Iraq would want to
commit boots on the ground to protect an ally]{.underline}, but there is
now bipartisan support in the U.S. to prevent the CCP from swallowing
Taiwan,\" he said. \"Even if Trump fails to get re-elected, the next
president might still be adamant about selling arms to Taiwan \-- and
using military force to deter a full-scale invasion.\"

Lam sees activities such as U.S. weapon sales to Taipei and patrols of
the Taiwan Strait by American frigates increasing between now and the
next U.S. presidential election in November 2020. Indeed, Rupert
Hammond-Chambers, the president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council,
said last month he expects another round of arms sales before the end of
the year.

\"Taiwan is a key element of Trump\'s toolbox to ensure victory over
China in the new Cold War,\" Lam said. \"Both countries are now locked
in a ferocious struggle for supremacy to be leader of the whole world.\"

China\'s impotence in the face of Clinton\'s show of support for Taiwan
22 years ago was the impetus for the modernization of the Chinese armed
forces, especially its navy. Today, **[another crisis in the Taiwan
Strait would likely be the greatest challenge the unofficial U.S.-Taiwan
alliance has ever faced.]{.underline}**

#### Cutting off arm sales [now]{.underline} is key\-\--new arms packages incentivize preemptive Chinese aggression and crush relations 

**Chung 18**. \[Lawrence Chung covers major news in Taiwan, ranging from
presidential and parliament elections to killer earthquakes and
typhoons. Most of his reports focus on Taiwan's relations with China,
specifically on the impact and possible developments of cross-strait
relations under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and
mainland-friendly Kuomintang governments. Before starting work at the
South China Morning Post in 2006, he wrote for Reuters and AFP for more
than 12 years, "Beijing tells US to cancel US\$330 million Taiwan arms
deal"
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2165609/us-announces-new-taiwan-arms-deal-worth-us330-million\]

The planned arms deal was announced days after the US State Department
imposed sanctions on a key Chinese military unit and its director for
buying Russian fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles -- a move that
inflamed tensions amid the spiralling trade war.

[Chinese analysts said]{.underline} **[the latest moves]{.underline}**
**[showed all aspects of China-US relations]{.underline}** -- from trade
to security -- **[were under strain, and Beijing was likely to
retaliate]{.underline}**.

"**[Beijing is much more confident now]{.underline}**, and **[it's in a
better position to take countermeasures than]{.underline}** it was
**[before]{.underline}**," said Shen Dingli, director of the Programme
on Arms Control and Regional Security at Fudan University in Shanghai.

"The US has to work with other countries, including China, in areas like
counterterrorism, non-proliferation, anti-money laundering and
infectious disease control," he said. "It can't expect China to
cooperate whenever it makes a demand while it is hurting China's
interests."

**[This year's arms deal is]{.underline}** relatively
**[small]{.underline}** compared with previous years and it involves
maintenance and spare parts, which will not make much difference to the
power balance across the strait, said Pang Zhongying, a foreign affairs
expert at the Ocean University of China. **[But he said it was the
timing of the announcement that had infuriated Beijing]{.underline}**,
**[coming so soon after the sanctions were imposed]{.underline}**.

**[This will be the second US arms deal]{.underline}** to Taiwan
**[under]{.underline}** the administration of US President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** **[after it agreed to sell a US\$1.4 billion
weapons package]{.underline}**, **[mainly missiles]{.underline}**, [to
the island last yea]{.underline}r.

Hong Kong-based military commentator Song Zhongping said **[there was
likely to be a much bigger and more sensitive deal announced next
year]{.underline}** -- possibly **[including the powerful M1A2 tanks
that Taiwan has asked for]{.underline}** -- after **[the US
Congress]{.underline}** passed the National Defence Authorisation Act,
**[pledging to sell more weapons to the island.]{.underline}**

"**[US arms sales]{.underline}** to Taiwan **[are a long-term
matter]{.underline}**. **[The smaller deal this year means they could be
building up to challenge Beijing with something bigger in the
future]{.underline}**," Song said

#### Taiwan is the most important [starting point]{.underline} to address strategic distrust -- plan is the vital internal link to broader, sustainable cooperation

**Glaser 15** - Charles L Glaser is a professor in the Elliott School of
International Affairs and the Department of Political Science at George
Washington University. He is also a fellow in the Kissinger Institute at
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ("A U.S.-China
Grand Bargain?" International Security, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Spring 2015),
pp. 49--90, doi:10.1162/ISEC_a_00199

More important, however, is that focusing on the quality of current
crossstrait relations overlooks two other less direct, but potentially
more significant, benefits of U.S. accommodation on Taiwan. First,
[[U.S. support for Taiwan is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the most
important, possibly [[the **most important**]{.underline},
[policy-driven sources of China's suspicions about U.S.
motives]{.underline}]{.mark} and intentions. Although the United States
does not take a position on what the final outcome of the Taiwan issue
should be, [[China considers U.S. support of Taiwan a **key source** of
"strategic distrust]{.underline}]{.mark}." A recent study by two leading
authorities on U.S.-China relations concludes that B[eijing views U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan "as confirming American arrogance and determination
to interfere in China's domestic affairs]{.underline} and to prevent
peaceful unification from occurring, thereby harming a
clearly-articulated Chinese core interest." In a similar vein, their
report argues that "[continuing to provide Taiwan with advanced
weapons]{.underline} . . . is viewed as pernicious in Chinese eyes and
[has added to suspicion that Washington will disregard Chinese interests
and sentiments as long as China's power position is secondary to
America's]{.underline}."68 Nathan and Scobell conclude that "[most
Chinese]{.underline} see strategic motives at the root of American
behavior. They [believe that keeping the Taiwan problem going helps the
U.S. tie China down]{.underline}."69 Similarly, [a prominent Chinese
analyst argues: ["The position the U.S. takes on the Taiwan issue
determines the **essence of American strategy** toward
China]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and thus **determines the quality and
status of U.S.-China relations**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}"70
Xu [Hui, a professor at China's National Defense University, holds that
["U.S. policies toward Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} have been and [[are
the **fundamental** cause of]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[anti-American
sentiment among the **Chinese public**]{.underline}]{.mark}\....I assure
you that [[a posture change of the U.S. policy on Taiwan will remove the
major obstacle for]{.mark} our military-to-military relations and also
strengthen [Sino-American cooperation]{.mark} by winning the **hearts
and minds** of 1.3 billion Chinese people.]{.underline}"71 In short,
[[ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan has the potential to
**dramatically improve U.S.-China relations**, which in turn could
increase the possibility of **cooperation on other issues**]{.mark} and
reduce the probability of competition and conflict]{.underline}.

#### Independently, strong US-China relations prevent every scenario for [extinction]{.underline}

Preface: Global Future Depends on Depth of China-US Cooperation

The [world]{.underline} has achieved unprecedented peace, prosperity,
and inter-dependence, but past achievements --- and further
[progress]{.underline} --- [are threatened by]{.underline} a host of
[looming challenges]{.underline}. Global institutions that served us
well and transformed the world are becoming victims of their own success
and must be reformed or replaced to deal with new challenges and take
advantage of new opportunities. Governments everywhere face rising
expectations and increasing demands but find themselves less able to
manage the challenges they face. [The next round of
challenges]{.underline} [can only be managed successfully
if]{.underline} nations, especially [major powers,
cooperate]{.underline}. Moreover, [the most difficult and most
consequential challenges]{.underline} [cannot be managed]{.underline}
effectively [without]{.underline} **[sustained
cooperation]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} the largest developing
country, [**China**, and]{.underline} the largest developed country,
**[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Stated another
way, [the ability of China and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to work together]{.underline} on critical
global challenges will [determine]{.underline} [whether the world is
able to]{.underline} sustain and enhance mutually beneficial
developments or fails to [cope with]{.underline} the [issues critical
to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[global future]{.underline}** and to
the security and prosperity of the United States and China. This shared
conviction persuades us that we must do more than just hope that our
countries will find ways to cooperate. This report represents a joint
effort to develop both the rationale and concrete mechanisms for
sustained, proactive collaboration to address challenges resulting from
long-term global trends and consequential uncertainties. It builds on
the findings of independent efforts to identify megatrends and potential
game-changers with the goal of developing a framework for the US-China
relationship that will better enable us to meet the challenges facing
the global community and the strategic needs of both countries.
[The]{.underline} Joint Working [Group recognizes]{.underline} that
China and the United States hold different views on many bilateral and
international issues, and that [our relationship is constrained
by]{.underline} mutual [suspicion]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
strategic [mistrust]{.underline}. [Nevertheless]{.underline}, our
**[common strategic interests]{.underline}** and responsibility as major
powers [are more important]{.underline} than the specific issues that
divide us; we must not make cooperation on critical global issues
contingent on prior resolution of bilateral disputes. Our disagreements
on bilateral issues are important, but they are not as important to our
long-term security and prosperity as is our ability to cooperate on key
challenges to global security and our increasingly intertwined futures.
We must cooperate on global challenges not as a favor to one another or
because other nations expect us to exercise leadership in the
international system. We must do it because failure to cooperate on key
global challenges will have profoundly negative consequences for the
citizens of our own countries. The Joint Working Group has no illusions
about how difficult the task ahead will be. Leaders in both countries
face relentless domestic pressures to focus on near-term issues, often
to the detriment of long-term interests, as well as on looming US-China
bilateral differences and mutual suspicions. This report seeks to
illustrate why it is imperative and how it is possible to pursue long-
and short-term interests at the same time.

How We Reached Key Assessments and Recommendations

Generous support from the China-United States Exchange Foundation
enabled the Atlantic Council and the China Institute of International
Studies (CIIS) to establish a Joint Working Group of experts from both
countries. The members of the group met in Beijing and Washington in the
spring and summer of 2012 to compare and integrate the findings of
separate Chinese and US draft reports on global trends. The Chinese
projection of trends, entitled Global Trends to 2030 and the Prospects
for China-US Relations, was prepared by CIIS with contributions from the
School of International Studies at Peking University. The US report,
Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds, was prepared by the US National
Intelligence Council (NIC).\[1\] The Atlantic Council contributed to the
NIC report and members of the NIC team attended (as observers) the joint
assessment meetings. This review confirmed that the independently
developed reports were generally consistent in their assessments of
global trends and provided a solid basis for development of scenarios to
illustrate what might happen under different assumptions about
cooperation between China and the United States. The scenarios in both
analyses depict markedly different outcomes for China, the United
States, and the world. When China and the United States cooperate to
meet looming challenges, both countries benefit. When they fail to
cooperate and pursue narrow interests or win-lose or zero-sum outcomes,
both countries lose. Continuing down the path of drift and episodic
cooperation that we are on now also leads to lose-lose outcomes. The
obvious advantages of win-win outcomes and dangerous implications of
behaviors that eschew or minimize cooperation create strong incentives
to focus on megatrends, critical challenges, and enhancing the
likelihood of success and mutual benefit through close and continuous
collaboration. This report outlines the case for collaboration and makes
several specific recommendations to make cooperation both possible and
fruitful. It was drafted and circulated among group members for
revisions and to ensure consensus. China and the United States have
different interests, objectives, and perspectives on many matters, and
the number of issues in dispute may well grow as we broaden our
bilateral relationship and at times disagree with one another on the
world stage. Resolving some of these issues will be difficult and
require much time and effort. The resolution of these contentious issues
in the US-China relationship, however, must not be made a prerequisite
for cooperation on a limited but arguably more important set of issues
with the clear potential to harm both of our interests. Continued drift
toward strategic competition and failure to find a balance of interests
on core issues will undermine support in both countries for cooperation
on major global issues of mutual interest and benefit. Cooperation on
shared global challenges may build trust and make it easier to resolve
nettlesome bilateral issues. But that would be an ancillary benefit and
should not be the primary reason for collaboration on the global
challenges identified in the independently prepared studies and
summarized elsewhere in this report. The primary reasons we need to work
together on the [global challenges]{.underline} are that they [cannot be
addressed successfully]{.underline} [unless we do,]{.underline} and that
[failure to deal effectively with]{.underline}
[consequential]{.underline} **[megatrends]{.underline}** [will have
deleterious consequences for]{.underline} China, the United States, and
[the world]{.underline}. [It is difficult to envision a stable,
prosperous global system absent a US-China relationship that
is]{.underline} largely a [cooperative]{.underline} one. Forces and
[megatrends]{.underline} that are visible but not well understood today
will shape the futures of people everywhere. The list
[includes]{.underline} consequences of globalization that increase
prosperity but also increase **[demand for water]{.underline}**,
**[food]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}**. It
also includes demographic change and [effects of climate
change]{.underline} that [will intensify the consequences]{.underline}
of other megatrends and make them more difficult to manage. Some of [the
megatrends]{.underline} and the way they interact will
[threaten]{.underline} social and political **[stability]{.underline}**
[unless managed effectively]{.underline}. [All have profound
implications for]{.underline} governance and **[global
stability]{.underline}**. How effectively governments meet and manage
these challenges in the next ten to twenty years will determine how
beneficial or detrimental they will be for our countries and our
children. Successfully navigating the turbulent waters ahead will
require understanding the challenges we face and foresight about the
implications of alternative paths. Our common goal must be to avert or
ameliorate negative outcomes, and to maximize the chances of achieving
desirable outcomes. To accomplish this goal, China and the United States
must establish and draw on a continuing dialogue on the evolution,
implications, and possible policy responses to the most consequential
megatrends, key uncertainties, and disruptive change. The framework and
policy recommendations of this report seek to jumpstart that process by
suggesting mechanisms for collaboration that begin bilaterally but
eventually include other nations critical to finding paths to a better
future for all.

I. Critical Importance of China-US Cooperation

[The global future is likely to be **increasingly
volatile**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[uncertain]{.underline}**.
The rate of change is increasing, driven by the accelerating pace of
technological development, unprecedented urbanization and growth of the
global middle class, and a wide range of challenges beyond the control
of any one country but potentially affecting the prosperity and security
of all countries. Disruptive change in one geographic or functional area
will spread quickly.. [No country]{.underline}, and certainly not those
with the largest populations and largest economies, [will be
immune]{.underline}. [Global challenges]{.underline} like climate
change, **[food]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**water shortages**,
and]{.underline} **[resource scarcities]{.underline}** will shape the
strategic context for all nations and [require
reconsideration]{.underline} [of traditional national
concerns]{.underline} such as sovereignty and maximizing the ability of
national leaders to control their country's destiny. [What China and the
United States do]{.underline}, individually and together, [will have
a]{.underline} **[major impact]{.underline}** [on the
future]{.underline} [of the global system]{.underline}. As importantly,
[our]{.underline} individual [fate]{.underline}s [will be]{.underline}
**[inextricably linked]{.underline}** to how that future plays out. The
three illustrative scenarios sketched out below underscore how critical
the future of the US-China relationship is to each country and to the
world. , Global Drift and Erosion ([the present world
trajectory]{.underline}): In a world in which [nations fail to resolve
global problems]{.underline} and strengthen mechanisms of global
cooperation, governments gradually turn inward. Each nation seeks to
protect and advance its own narrow national interests or to preserve an
unsustainable status quo that is rapidly changing in ways that erode the
international order. The international community's lack of ability to
cooperate to meet global challenges leads to international crises and
instability. , Zero-Sum World: Unsustainable drift leads to a world of
predominantly zero-sum competition and conflict in the face of severe
resource constraints. The result is economic crises and internal
instability as well as interstate confrontation. There is risk of
military conflict between major powers, which increases global mistrust
and uncertainty and fosters an "each nation for itself" mentality that
further undermines the ability of states to cooperate in the face of
growing common challenges. , Global Revitalization and Cooperation: [To
escape the perils]{.underline} [of drift]{.underline} or zero-sum
competition, [leaders]{.underline} in countries with the most to lose
**[work together]{.underline}** [to manage]{.underline} and take
advantage of global challenges and [megatrends]{.underline}.
[Cooperation makes it possible to achieve]{.underline} [win-win outcomes
that avoid or mitigate negative consequences]{.underline} [of increased
demand for resources and the impact of climate change]{.underline} as
well as to harness new technologies to improve living conditions through
sustainable development. Cooperation creates and utilizes new
transnational institutions to prevent conflict and enhance security for
all. China and the United States become more prosperous as we work
together. The possible futures sketched out above (and developed at
greater length below) are intended to stimulate thinking about how
current trends and uncertainties could lead to very different global and
national outcomes. For many reasons, the United States and China will
have greater ability and incentives than other countries to cooperate in
determining and shaping developments over the next two decades. Indeed,
it is very difficult to imagine a pathway to "global revitalization and
cooperation" in which China and the United States do not cooperate and
provide critical international leadership. [Many factors]{.underline}
will [shape the future]{.underline}, some of which are beyond the
control of any nation state, [but]{.underline} China and the United
States --- and [the character of the US-China relationship]{.underline}
--- [will be]{.underline} **[critical]{.underline}**. The mutual
dependence on each other's economic performance and the success of the
global economy as a whole was demonstrated during the 2008 financial
crisis that began in the United States but quickly spread around the
world. US and Chinese leaders recognized that they were in the "same
boat" strategically and engaged in a closely coordinated response to the
crisis, which played a key---if not decisive---role in preventing the
situation from becoming much worse. The need for joint and coordinated
responses to economic crises and to mounting economic challenges and
threats is certain to increase as globalization continues and
interdependence deepens.

II\. Critical Megatrends

There are many global trends that are positive, including greater
prosperity; global economic reconvergence after two centuries of Western
economic preponderance; profound social changes driven by rapid
scientific and technological changes; a growing global middle class;
widespread improvement in global health and life expectancy; and overall
reduction in war and violent deaths. The great advances in human
prosperity over the last several decades and the potential for greater
gains in the future are to be celebrated, but they also create new
challenges shaped by megatrends in the "global operating environment".
[These megatrends include]{.underline}: , Individual empowerment is an
increasingly important factor both within states and internationally.
The empowerment of individuals is fueled by education, rising
prosperity, and a host of technologies. Empowered individuals, the
growing middle class, and domestic NGOs are more willing to engage in
political activities as well as to make more demands on government. [The
sense of national identity]{.underline} is [becoming
stronger]{.underline} in many places but so too are social identities
based on ethnicity, religion, culture, political concerns, and shared
causes such as the environment and public health. This trend sometimes
also [fuels **extremism** and **separatism**]{.underline}. , Power will
be increasingly diffused as the number of players with actual or nascent
capacity to influence international deve-lopments is increasing. [The
international system evinces increasing signs of fragmentation and
stratification.]{.underline} In addition to the rise of China, India,
and Brazil, middle powers such as Turkey, Indonesia, South Africa, and
Mexico are playing an ever more important role in the international
arena. Further, the growing numbers and types of non-state actors such
as international NGOs, multinational enterprises, and regional
organizations mean states themselves no longer control the system. ,
[Aging]{.underline} and urbanizing [populations]{.underline},
[accompanied by waves of]{.underline} domestic and international
[migration]{.underline}, will transform societies and [strain
capabilities]{.underline}. [More than one billion people]{.underline}
[will be added]{.underline} to the global population [by
2030]{.underline} and an equal or greater number will move to cities.
Rising incomes will enable as many as two billion more people to join
the global middle class. Nearly all of the growth in the global
population, urban dwellers, and the middle class will occur in
developing countries. Critical demographic shifts will age populations
and shrink the percentage of working-age cohorts in most of the
developed and, increasingly, in parts of the developing world as well.
China will be one of the developing countries with an aging population.
[Waves of immigration]{.underline} will create or [exacerbate
significant social problems]{.underline}, but there also will be a huge
international marketplace for skilled and talented workers. , [There
will be increasing stresses]{.underline} and strains [on the global
commons]{.underline}. Many challenges to the
**[environment]{.underline}** and human security will be intensified by
rapidly increased **[food]{.underline}**, **[water]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} natural **[resource consumption]{.underline}** due to
growing population, urbanization, and rapid expansion of the middle
class. [If not managed well]{.underline}, [these challenges could have a
significant and long-term adverse impact]{.underline} on all nations and
the global system. , There is increasing concern that global climate
change poses an existential threat to humanity. **[Climate
change]{.underline}** [exacerbates water shortages]{.underline} [and
food production challenges]{.underline}; [sparks greater migration and
social conflict]{.underline}; acidifies the oceans; [and leads to more
extreme weather events]{.underline}, including sea-level rises
magnifying the impact of storm surges threatening coastal cities and
infrastructure. There is likely to be [more focus by the international
community]{.underline} [on]{.underline} climate change **[consequence
management]{.underline}**, **[adaptation]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[mitigation]{.underline}**.

III\. Key Uncertainties

The megatrends summarized above constitute a relatively predictable set
of challenges facing individuals and nations, especially China and the
United States. But they are not the only factors that will influence
developments in the next two decades. The relatively predictable
megatrends will interact with a number of critical uncertainties.
Examples include: , **[The future of the global economy is
volatile]{.underline}**. The developed countries, especially in the
Eurozone, may face a prolonged period of recovery. The developing
countries, including China and India, face a "middle income trap". [The
world could experience growing economic nationalism]{.underline} [and
trade protectionism]{.underline} as well as an accelerating adjustment
of international industrial division of labor as China refocuses on
domestic consumption-led growth, other nations increasingly displace
China as the low-cost provider, and new manufacturing technologies and
lower energy costs encourage the return of manufacturing to the United
States and other developed countries. In addition, major economic crises
could result from the increasing pressure on resource availability
discussed previously. , The [accelerating pace of technological
development is likely to change the global operating environment for
foreign policy and national security over the next two decades with
uncertain consequences]{.underline}. A wide range of [emerging
technologies]{.underline} will affect the political, social, economic
and security trajectories of states, international relations, and the
international system, as have the Internet, mobile communications
technology, and social media. These technologies range from new energy
systems and manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing to bio- and
nanotechnology breakthroughs affecting agricultural productivity, human
enhancement, robotics, and information availability. On the negative
side of the ledger, **[cyber hacking]{.underline}**, **[cyber
warfare]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[genomics-enabled
bioterrorism]{.underline}** [have the potential to be highly disruptive.
,]{.underline} [Nationalistic responses to]{.underline} [increasing
mutual vulnerability]{.underline} are likely as growing global
interconnectedness and interdependence ensure that developments anywhere
in the world, from slowly-developing threats like climate change to
short-term crises like the 2008 financial crisis, can affect most
nations and citizens yet be largely, if not completely, outside the
control of individual states. National responses to common challenges
and threats could be "each nation for itself" actions to achieve narrow
national interests at the expense of other states and the common good. ,
[Unpredictable events]{.underline} such as **[natural
disasters]{.underline}**, **[extreme weather]{.underline}** events,
**[pandemics]{.underline}**, or **[nuclear weapon use by
terrorists]{.underline}** [could be game-changers. An H5N1 or similar
pandemic could shut down global transportation and kill tens of millions
or more]{.underline} with a huge impact on the global economy, politics,
and security. A series of extreme weather events, foreshadowed by
Hurricane Sandy's impact on the United States, could change the
trajectories of global political efforts to deal with the consequences
of climate change. , The future of both China and the United States is
uncertain. China has many internal challenges that could limit its
willingness to be a "joint responsible stakeholder" with the United
States to meet global challenges and resolve regional conflicts.
Similarly, the United States faces major economic challenges that could
lead to long-term slow growth, a more inward focus, and a less active
and influential role in catalyzing cooperation on global challenges.
Conversely, one or both countries could achieve considerable success in
its/their domestic arena(s) and feel emboldened to lead the
transformation of the global system. , [**Conflicts** could become more
common]{.underline} [and more intense]{.underline} [as]{.underline} a
result of **[social unrest]{.underline}**, **[religious
extremism]{.underline}**, [reduced]{.underline} provision of **[public
goods]{.underline}**, **[power shifts]{.underline}**, and individual
empowerment. [The world's security and stability may become increasingly
fragile as a result of]{.underline} **[state failure]{.underline}**,
**[nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**, or dramatic acts of
**[terrorism]{.underline}**, [especially in unstable regions like the
Middle East and South Asia.]{.underline} , [Regional
instability]{.underline} may [have global impact]{.underline}. [A major
conflict in the Middle East]{.underline}, including over Iran's nuclear
weapons, [could]{.underline} **[draw in outside powers]{.underline}**,
disrupt oil supplies, and send the global economy into recession.
[Failure to resolve]{.underline} or indefinitely shelve [territorial
disputes]{.underline} [in]{.underline} East and Southeast
[Asia]{.underline} could limit the ability of regional states to
cooperate in global as well as regional efforts to cope with global
challenges. [Military conflict]{.underline} over these disputes also
**[could]{.underline}** [destabilize]{.underline} the Asia-Pacific
region with grave consequences for the global economy and international
stability. An existential crisis of the European Union could disrupt the
cohesiveness of what is now the world's largest economy.

IV\. Governance and Cooperation Challenges of Megatrends and
Uncertainties

Although no one can predict with confidence exactly how events will play
out in the years ahead, [we can be confident that the
challenges]{.underline} and choices facing decision-makers at all levels
and in all countries [will be shaped by]{.underline} the interplay of
megatrends, known uncertainties, [unexpected]{.underline} "**[black
swan" events]{.underline}**, and the decisions of governments and
nongovernmental actors. [Waiting to see how events unfold
is]{.underline} a possible but [undesirable]{.underline} choice because
waiting is, in effect, a decision to do nothing and hope for the best.
[We can and must do better than that by working to shape events in ways
that reduce uncertainty]{.underline}, [avoid or ameliorate undesirable
trajectories, and increase the likelihood of win-win
outcomes.]{.underline} Some of the challenges posed include: , Volatile
global economy: Slower economic growth and potential crises such as a
Eurozone meltdown, another global financial crisis, or a sustained spike
in food prices could slow or reverse progress toward greater prosperity
and better lives for more people. Growing inequality (worsening GINI
coefficients\[2\]) could further compound the challenges. Although the
rich and the poor alike may become richer, the absolute gaps between
them likely will widen, both within and among countries and regions.
Moreover, the middle class may continue to be squeezed not only in
developed countries but also in developing countries despite more rapid
economic growth, especially as the gap widens between the middle class
and the super rich. , Increasing internal pressures on governments:
Demands on governments at all levels likely will increase faster than
the availability of resources required to satisfy them. More people with
rising expectations and greater awareness of conditions at home and
elsewhere will have more tools, especially social media, to organize and
put pressure on governments to provide more services and opportunities.
The rising middle class in the emerging economies likely will expect and
demand more and better quality food and water, more reliable supplies of
cleaner energy, improved infrastructure, and healthier environments.
Governments could find it difficult to meet rising expectations,
however, especially growing demand for increasingly limited resources,
which will push prices upward and exacerbate economic and social
instability. At the same time, some of the poorest countries with
ineffective governments may be pushed into internal conflict and state
failure by tribal, ethnic, and religious strife as well as economic and
environmental stresses. These internal conflicts could lead to regional
instability as environmental and economic migrants spill into
neighboring states. Global cooperation gap widening: Increasing
globalization and interdependence could make it more difficult for
national govern-ments to manage new challenges on their own, but
transnational institutions will be increasingly ill-suited or even
incapable of meeting twenty-first century challenges. To meet the
growing challenges, existing global mechanisms, most of which are legacy
institutions from the post-World War II era designed to solve problems
from the inter-war period, must be reformed or replaced. That will not
be easy. There are 140 more countries today than there were when the
global system was last reformed in the 1940s and all feel entitled to a
seat at the table when decisions are made that will affect their own
destinies. This widely shared ethos of democratic participation of all
nations makes it difficult to strike a balance between equity of
representation and efficacy of decision-making. , Domestic pressures and
weak national governments: Gov-ernments may become less willing or able
to cooperate with other nations as a result of domestic pressures on
leaders to pursue narrow national interests. This will increase the
likelihood of nations engaging in zero-sum behavior that will make it
even more difficult to deal with the most challenging megatrends. ,
Extremism and fracturing of the nation-state: Extremism and separatism
are likely to be fueled by individual empowerment and tribal, ethnic,
religious, and other identities, strengthened by ubiquitous social
media. The power and authority of the nation-state is likely to be
increasingly circumscribed by the rising power of non-state actors and
the growing importance of transnational challenges beyond the state's
control. The state is being challenged in many cases by separatist and
extremist forces, including religious fundamentalists in Waziristan and
Dagestan and regional nationalists in Catalonia and Scotland. , "[Black
swans]{.underline}" and lack of robust international institutions:
Failure to establish robust international institutions and habits of
cooperation could reduce the international community's ability to
respond to major crises, including black swan events. The latter
[are]{.underline} **[high impact]{.underline}** but either improbable or
simply **[unpredictable]{.underline}** [calamities]{.underline} [such as
pandemics, nuclear weapon or biological warfare attacks, or cyber
meltdowns]{.underline}. [If China and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [act as rivals]{.underline} and give priority
to parochial interests, [it may be impossible]{.underline} for the
international community [to successfully confront]{.underline} [the
major challenges]{.underline} of the next twenty years. [Owing to
their]{.underline} **[size]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[importance]{.underline}** [in the global system]{.underline}, [what
China and the US do together]{.underline} as well as individually [will
profoundly affect the]{.underline} [international community's ability to
engage in robust international cooperation]{.underline} in science and
technology [to find solutions]{.underline} to the world's most pressing
problems.

V. Scenarios Illustrate Interconnections and Alternative Outcomes

As the megatrends and uncertainties evolve over the coming two decades
and beyond, China and the United States, along with the rest of the
world, will face unprecedented challenges and unpredictable, disruptive
change. We offer three global scenarios to illustrate how the complex
megatrends, key uncertainties, and disruptive changes could play out,
depending in large part on whether the relationship between China and
the United States is primarily cooperative or conflictual. , Global
Drift and Erosion: This scenario is characterized by the inability of
China and the United States to work together effectively, if at all, to
address key global challenges and to resolve regional conflicts.
Problems created or exacerbated by the megatrends, key uncertainties,
and their interactions worsen, creating a world that is less peaceful,
less stable, and less prosperous. The debacle of the 2009 Copenhagen UN
climate change conference demonstrated the global impact of the failure
of the United States and China to agree on far-reaching steps to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. In this future, the US and China again fail to
respond adequately to continuing problems such as economic imbalances
associated with the efforts of many countries to break into and then
move from middle income status to that of high income. There is
disruptive socio-political change related in part to both economic and
demographic transitions, and environmental problems involving inadequate
energy, water, and food resources. Washington and Beijing could be too
preoccupied with political and military competition and territorial
disputes in the Western Pacific, as well as by bilateral differences
over intellectual property and other trade issues, to tackle these
pressing problems. Among possible developments, US-China tensions could
adversely affect global responses to energy challenges. These range from
threats to security of supplies resulting from conflict in the Middle
East and Persian Gulf to the need for a global energy transition away
from fossil fuels to minimize carbon emissions and the impact of energy
price volatility on global economic growth. Further, China and the
United States also could fail to cooperate in efforts to mitigate the
potentially disruptive impact of greatly increased demand for food,
water, and other resources created by the addition of more than one
billion people to the global population by 2030 as well as possibly two
billion or more people to the developing world middle class. Without
adequate international cooperation and global governmental mechanisms,
this could lead to deeper economic crises, unresolved political
conflicts, and worsening environmental conditions. , Zero-Sum World: A
second possible trajectory could lead to the emergence of an even more
competitive and dangerous zero-sum world, in which nations pursue narrow
national interests. For example, the world could experience intense
monetary and trade protectionism, with countries seeking geopolitical
advantage at the expense of international cooperation for the common
good. It could see intensifying rivalries, creating hostilities and
rendering cooperation on global challenges nearly impossible as global
governmental mechanisms break down or are marginalized. In this
scenario, the impact of megatrends and critical challenges on global
developments is overwhelmingly negative. The world economy is in a
tailspin, brought on, perhaps, by a deepening European recession
followed by a new meltdown of the global financial system and then a
worse recession than that sparked by the 2008 financial crisis. Regional
conflicts and disputes in East Asia intensify suspicions and threaten to
ignite conflict among the major powers. The United States and China not
only fail to cooperate on longer-term global issues but also fail to
work together to resolve immediate regional tensions which spin out of
control, leading to military conflict that threatens to drag the US and
China into direct confrontation. , Global Revitalization and
Cooperation: A third possible trajectory could lead to a world in which
sustained and [effective cooperation builds/rebuilds key institutions to
address old and emerging challenges as well as "black
swans]{.underline}". Globalization and global integration continue apace
with more successful efforts to mitigate or prepare for negative
consequences. This scenario is characterized by greater strategic
stability among major powers and by sustained prosperity and economic
growth in China, the United States, and most other countries. [Through
cooperative development]{.underline} and deployment of new technologies
[countries implement effective measures to manage energy, water,
governance, and other challenges.]{.underline} [The result would be a
wide range of win-win outcomes for all nations]{.underline}. [It is
difficult to find **any**]{.underline} credible [path to]{.underline}
such "[global revitalization and cooperation" that does not
include]{.underline} [a cooperative US-China relationship]{.underline}.
[This makes efforts to achieve such an outcome]{.underline}
**[imperative]{.underline}** for the leaders of both countries,
[despite]{.underline} the [differences]{.underline} and suspicions
between them. Many variants of these scenarios are possible, but the
dangers of a fragmented, competitive, or adversarial world are as clear
as the advantages of cooperation. Consultations with experts in China,
the United States, and many other countries indicate widespread
recognition that [failure to address megatrends]{.underline} and looming
challenges [cooperatively]{.underline} will [lead to]{.underline}
suboptimal and even **[catastrophic outcomes]{.underline}**. But general
recognition is insufficient to establish priorities, identify critical
linkages, and develop concrete proposals for collective action. The
stakes are too high to rely on chance and informal procedures.

#### Defensive realism is true and shapes China's rise -- China seeks to maximize security to ensure their own survival which means the plan's resolution of the main regional source of insecurity makes China feel secure and satisfied

**Raditio 14**. \[Klaus Heinrich, PhD student at the Department of
Government and International Relations of the University of Sydney;
Junior Policy Associate at China Studies Centre of the University of
Sydney, "China and the Tension in the South China Sea: A Defensive
Realist Perspective," University of Sydney, 2014,
https://aacs.ccny.cuny.edu/2014conference/Papers/Klaus%20Raditio.pdf\]

[China is **a defensive realist state** It is necessary to identify the
nature of the states involved to discover whether a security dilemma
applies]{.underline} in the SCS, [because **security dilemmas only take
place between defensive realist states**]{.underline}. Although Tang
mentions security dilemmas between two states, this paper argues that it
can apply between two or more states. In this context, this paper aims
to elaborate the situation in the SCS among its claimants, especially
between China on the one side, and other SCS claimants, i.e. Vietnam,
the Philippines and Malaysia, on the other side. [Unlike an offensive
realist state, which seeks security by power maximisation even if it
violates other states' security, a defensive realist state does not
pursue security by offending others, unless **it has very exceptional
reasons**]{.underline}.\'? In fact, a defensive realist state is very
reluctant to launch attacks, and prefers a resistance behaviour when
facing an imminent threat. Is In addition[, a defensive realist state
**pursues security instead of expansion** and considers cooperation a
feasible means of self-defence]{.underline}.\" [A defensive realist
state also voluntarily restrains itself and accepts other countries\'
constraints.\"]{.underline} [The main military strategy of a defensive
realist state is **self-defence and deterrence, not
expansion**.]{.underline} [It favours a strategy between engagement and
passive containment, and rejects active containment, let alone
preventive war.2\']{.underline} From the above-mentioned criteria for a
defensive realist state, [one can be assured that China is a defensive
realist state, as well as other claimants in the SCS, mainly Vietnam,
the Philippines and Malaysia. These countries do not have ambitions to
expand, and seek security in terms of self-help **instead of pursuing
hegemonic power**]{.underline}. The debate on China\'s nature will be
much more intensive and vigorous compared with other claimants in the
SCS. This is because China has been accused of being assertive,
aggressive and abrasive in the SCS, whereas other claimants have seldom
been accused of such things. I argue that the Philippines, Vietnam and
Malaysia can be categorised as defensive realist states, because of
their non-expansionary behaviour and their attitude towards cooperation.
[Regarding China, Tang argues that, since 1978, the country has
**shifted from being an offensive realist state** to a defensive realist
state. Furthermore, Tang attributes China\'s success in the past three
decades to this shift in its strategy.]{.underline}22 Ralf Emmers also
suggested that in the more specific period after 1995, relations between
China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Nations) members bilaterally
and multilaterally reached a golden age.23 China and the ASEAN
cooperated in various fields, which resulted in truly significant
achievements, such as the ASEAN Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in
the SCS in 2002, and China\'s accession to the Treaty of Amity and
Cooperation in Southeast Asia in 2003. One may argue that China\'s
attitude resembled a defensive realist state only in the late 1990s to
the mid-2000s, and since then its attitude has shifted to a more
aggressive stance. However, [I would contend for several reasons that,
although there is a shift in China\'s SCS strategy towards
aggressiveness, it is still a defensive realist state. First, during the
period of de-escalation after the Mischief Reef Incident]{.underline}
(the late 1990s to the mid-2000s), [**China adopted the strategy of
engagement** towards other claimants, with the aim of buying time to
consolidate its claims in the SCS]{.underline}---particularly to
jurisdiction over the disputed waters and maritime rights---and deter
other claimants from enhancing their claims at China\'s expense, such as
excluding China from resource exploration projects? [China also aimed to
reduce the influence that external powers, especially the US, had over
other claimants to avoid complicating its efforts to consolidate its
claim in the SCS. The adoption **of engagement strategy shows that China
is a defensive realist** state]{.underline}. [Second, China has **never
meant to be expansionist**. Regardless of how other states perceive
China, its claim over the Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands is not
something contemporary. China has a well-established stance that did not
appear unexpectedly nor recently]{.underline}. [As the country becomes
more developed and powerful, it adjusts its strategy to protect its
interests.]{.underline} The importance of the SCS to China and its
growing capability have made it determined to assert its interests more
vigorously, yet military conflict is not a viable option for China at
the moment. Third, [**China itself regards its attitude** as
self-defence. It is surrounded by the hostile attitudes of its
neighbours. The strong presence of the US in the region also adds to its
uneasiness]{.underline}. [The enhanced security alliance between other
claimants and external powers, especially the US, could have been
China\'s reason for adopting a more strident approach]{.underline}.25
[China is **neither an offensive realist** state nor a pacifist
state]{.underline}. Its proactive behaviour in exercising what it
perceives to be its rights to some extent is not beyond acceptable
limits. Fourth, [**China never dismisses cooperation** as a means to
avoid conflict]{.underline}. In fact, the idea of cooperation in the
SCS, known [as Deng Xiaoping\'s \"shelving disputes and seeking joint
development,\" was initiated by China. The country still formally
upholds this policy and has **never ruled out the possibility o**f
de-escalating the tension by reassurance and cooperation.\]{.underline}

**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[protested]{.mark} to

**demanded**]{.underline} [it [cancel a]{.mark} planned]{.underline}
**[US[\$330 million arms sale to Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [warning
that bilateral cooperation would be affected if it went ahead with the
deal]{.underline}. [The proposal]{.underline} announced by US defence
officials on Monday [comes as **relations**]{.underline} [between
Beijing and Washington are **already strained**]{.underline}. Taiwan
said the deal would help boost the self-ruled island's defences, but
[Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said
**[Beijing]{.mark}**]{.underline} had lodged stern representations with
the US about the plan. "We [[urge the **US**]{.underline}]{.mark} side
... [[to **immediately**]{.underline}]{.mark} cancel this deal and
**[[cut off military ties with Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to
avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} doing **[[serious damage to China-US]{.mark}
relations]{.underline}**, peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between US and China [in
**important areas**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Geng told a regular press
briefing on Tuesday, without elaborating. China's defence ministry also
delivered a similar warning. [The proposal]{.underline} will go before
the US Congress and [covers]{.underline} spare parts for [**F-16, C-130
and F-5** indigenous defence fighter jets, and other aircraft
systems.]{.underline} "This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign
policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve
the security and defensive capability of the recipient, which has been
and continues to be an important force for political stability, military
balance and economic progress in the region," the Pentagon's Defence
Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement. Beijing regards Taiwan
as a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland, by force if
necessary. It has previously warned Washington against selling weapons
to Taiwan and establishing military relations with the island, and
remains locked in a trade war with the US. Taiwan's Presidential Office
welcomed the move. "We greatly appreciate that the US government takes
note of the national security of Taiwan and its commitments to firmly
abide by the Taiwan Relations Act and six assurances \[regarding US
policy towards the island\]," office spokesman Alex Huang said. He said
the latest weapons sale could also help boost the island's confidence in
facing security challenges from Beijing, and strengthen its ability to
ensure cross-strait and regional peace and stability, thereby improving
cross-strait relations. "We will continue to increase our investment in
national defence, boost our defence industry and technology development,
and closely cooperate and communicate with the US on various security
issues and agendas," Huang said. The six assurances, issued by former US
president Ronald Reagan in 1982, include the US pledging not to set a
date for ending arms sales to Taiwan, not to hold prior consultations
with Beijing on arms sales to Taipei, and not to play a mediation role
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The planned arms deal was
announced days after the US State Department imposed sanctions on a key
Chinese military unit and its director for buying Russian fighter jets
and surface-to-air missiles -- a move that inflamed tensions amid the
spiralling trade war. Chinese analysts said [[the **latest
moves**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[showed]{.underline}]{.mark} **[all
aspects]{.underline}** [of China-US relations]{.underline} -- [from
trade to security]{.underline} -- [were **under strain**]{.underline},
and **[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[was **likely to
retaliate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[is **much more confident now**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and it's in
a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[better position to take
countermeasures]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[than]{.underline}]{.mark} it
was [[before]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Shen Dingli, director of the
Programme on Arms Control and Regional Security at Fudan University in
Shanghai. "[[The]{.underline} **[US]{.underline}** [has
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[work]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} other countries, including
[**[China]{.underline}**, [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [areas like
**counterterrorism**, **[non-proliferation]{.mark}**, **anti-money
laundering** and infectious disease control]{.underline}," he said.
"[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[can't]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[expect
China to **cooperate**]{.underline}]{.mark} whenever it makes a demand
[[while it is **hurting China's interests**]{.underline}]{.mark}."
[This]{.underline} year's [arms deal]{.underline} is relatively small
compared with previous years and it involves maintenance and spare
parts, which will not make much difference to the power balance across
the strait, said Pang Zhongying, a foreign affairs expert at the Ocean
University of China. But he said [it was the]{.underline}
**[timing]{.underline}** of the announcement that had **[infuriated
Beijing]{.underline}**, [coming so soon after the sanctions were
imposed]{.underline}. This will be the second US arms deal to Taiwan
under the administration of US President Donald Trump after it agreed to
sell a US\$1.4 billion weapons package, mainly missiles, to the island
last year. Hong Kong-based military commentator Song Zhongping said
**[[there was likely]{.mark} to be [a much bigger and more sensitive
deal]{.mark} announced [next year]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [possibly
including the powerful M1A2 tanks that Taiwan has asked for
--]{.underline} after the US Congress passed the National Defence
Authorisation Act, pledging to sell more weapons to the island. "[[US
arms sales to Taiwan are a **long-term matter**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[The]{.underline} smaller [deal this year means [they could]{.mark} be
**building up to [challenge Beijing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with
something]{.underline} **[bigger in the future]{.underline}**]{.mark},"
Song said.

of U.S. debt securities]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in **retaliation**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} recent **[[arms sales to

officers also said in state-controlled media interviews that Beijing's
leaders should boost defense spending and expand force deployments in
the wake of the Pentagon's announcement last month of a new \$6.4
million arms package for the island state claimed by Beijing. **[Senior
officers]{.underline}** from the Chinese National Defense University and
Academy of Military Sciences [made]{.underline} what some view as [an
**economic warfare threat**]{.underline}, something outlined in past
military writings. The comments by Maj. Gen. Zhu Chenghu and Maj. Gen.
Luo Yuan and Senior Col. Ke Chunqiao appeared in the state-run Outlook
Weekly magazine, part of the Xinhua News Agency, published in Beijing on
Monday. Gen. Luo warned that China could attack the U.S. "by oblique
means and stealthy feints," and he called for **[retaliation for the
arms sale]{.underline}**. "For example, [we could sanction them using
economic means, such as]{.underline} **[dumping some U.S. government
bonds,"]{.underline}** Gen. Luo said. "Our retaliation should not be
restricted to merely military matters, and we should adopt a strategic
package of counterpunches covering politics, military affairs, diplomacy
and economics to treat both the symptoms and root cause of this
disease," said Gen. Luo, a researcher at the Academy of Military
Sciences. [[**China** holds]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly **[[\$800
billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[worth of Treasury]{.mark} debt
[securities]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is not clear what impact selling
off some of the securities would have on the struggling U.S. economy.
However, analysts say that [[selling off]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[[bonds could **drive up interest rates**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[disrupt U.S. economic recovery]{.mark}
efforts]{.underline}**. At the State Department, spokesman P.J. Crowley
dismissed the economic threat as potentially self-defeating. "That would
be biting the nose to spite the face," Mr. Crowley said. "The economies
of the United States and China are intertwined." The Chinese military
comments, however, reflect the contents of a 1999 book by two Chinese
colonels called "Unrestricted Warfare," which called on the Chinese
military to adopt unconventional methods and strategy in waging war,
specifically both "financial" and "trade" war along with other forms of
warfare. The second officer, Gen. Zhu, said Monday that proposed U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan threatens Chinese military bases along the southern
coast across the 100-mile Taiwan Strait. "This gives us no choice but to
increase defense spending and adjust \[military\] deployments," said
Gen. Zhu, who is with the National Defense University in Beijing. Gen.
Zhu made headlines in 2005 when he told reporters that China would use
nuclear weapons to attack U.S. cities if the United States struck China
with precision-guided conventional missiles. The statement raised
questions at the time among Pentagon officials over whether China had
abandoned its stated policy of not being the first to use nuclear
weapons in a conflict. After the remarks, China's government sought to
play down the incident by quietly putting out word to Western
journalists that Gen. Zhu had been demoted, a claim accepted by many
U.S. China hands but one that was called into question by his comments
in the magazine this week. The military leaders' comments are unusual
because tightly controlled state-run media in China normally do not
permit such provocative comments directly criticizing the United States
to be published. China's military has no apparent control over the
country's financial policies, although the military remains a powerful
force in the communist system where ultimate power resides in the
Central Military Commission, headed by Chinese President Hu Jintao along
with two key generals as deputies. Pentagon officials have expressed
concerns in recent years that China's military may be acting outside its
political leadership. They pointed to differing explanations by Chinese
military and civilian leaders regarding the secret January 2007
anti-satellite missile test, and a perplexing incident in 2007 when the
aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk had permission to dock in Hong Kong for
Thanksgiving but was turned away by Chinese authorities upon nearing the
port. The last time Chinese officials raised economic threats against
the United States was 2007 when two economic officials warned of what
some called the "nuclear option" --- a campaign of economic threats ---
meant as a political weapon to counter opposition in Congress to China's
currency manipulation that has undermined the U.S. dollar. The Chinese
military officers said China's next defense budget, expected to be made
public in February, should reflect Beijing's opposition to the Taiwan
arms sale. "Clearly propose that due to the threat in the Taiwan Sea, we
are increasing military spending," Gen. Luo said. Gen. Luo said China
must change its approach to the United States and assert its power.
"China's attitude and actions over U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan will be
increasingly tough," he said. "That is inevitable with rising national
strength." John Tkacik, a former State Department China specialist, said
[[China's]{.mark} Central [Military Commission has the **power** to
order financial measures]{.mark}]{.underline} [[such as **selling U.S.
securities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, although it is a complex process.
"[[The Chinese military]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[believes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[China has **tremendous**
]{.mark}**economic and [financial leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline},
especially [[over the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[[and they are giving]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[fair
warning]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to the world [that **they will use
it**]{.mark} when they can]{.underline}," he said. The Obama
administration, like its predecessors, has said U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan are authorized under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, passed by
Congress in the aftermath of the shift in diplomatic recognition from
Taiwan to mainland China. The act authorizes sales of defensive arms.
China's government has rejected the U.S. justification, claiming that
U.S.-China joint communiques outlining relations call for limiting and
eventually ending all arms sales to Taiwan. China and the United States
have clashed in recent weeks on a number of issues in addition to the
Taiwan arms sale, including Beijing's opposition to the upcoming meeting
between President Obama and the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader, the
Dalai Lama. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also criticized
China recently for tightening controls on the Internet, which she
suggested was a violation of basic freedom. The administration also has
sought the Chinese government's explanation for the recent computer
attack on the Internet giant Google and several other U.S.
high-technology firms, suggesting that Beijing was behind the computer
intrusions and data theft. China's military spending has increased
sharply over the past decade as part of China's semi-secret military
buildup that has involved new deployments of advanced ballistic and
cruise missiles, large numbers of new warships and submarines, new
advanced fighter bombers and various high-tech weapons ranging from
computer network attacks and anti-satellite weapons.

KUALA LUMPUR and BERLIN, Feb 12 2019 (IPS) - [Economic
recovery]{.underline} efforts [since]{.underline} the
**[[2008]{.underline}]{.mark}**-2009 global financial crisis
[have]{.underline} mainly [[depended on **unconventional**]{.mark}
monetary **[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As fears rise
of]{.underline} yet [[another]{.underline}]{.mark} international
[**[financial crisis]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [there are]{.underline}
growing **[concerns]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} the
[[increase]{.mark}d]{.underline} [[possibility of **large-scale military
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. More worryingly, [in the **current
political landscape**]{.underline}, prolonged [**[economic
crisis]{.underline}**, [combined with]{.underline}]{.mark} rising
economic [inequality]{.underline}, chauvinistic
**[ethno-[populism]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as well as]{.underline}
aggressive **[jingoist rhetoric]{.underline}**, [including
**threats**]{.underline}, [[could]{.mark} easily **[spin out of
control]{.mark}** and 'morph' [into]{.mark}]{.underline} military
conflict, and worse, **[[world war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Crisis
responses limited The 2008-2009 global financial crisis almost
'bankrupted' governments and caused systemic collapse. Policymakers
managed to pull the world economy from the brink, but soon switched from
counter-cyclical fiscal efforts to unconventional monetary measures,
primarily 'quantitative easing' and very low, if not negative real
interest rates. But while these [monetary interventions]{.underline}
averted realization of the worst fears at the time by turning the US
economy around, they [did little to address **underlying** economic
**weaknesses**]{.underline}, largely due to the ascendance of finance in
recent decades at the expense of the real economy. Since then, despite
promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously pursued, let alone
achieved, such needed reforms. Instead, ostensible structural reformers
have taken advantage of the crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts
to further 'casualize' labour markets. This [lack of **structural
reform**]{.underline} [has meant]{.underline} that the [unprecedented
**liquidity** central banks injected into economies has **not been well
allocated**]{.underline} to stimulate resurgence of the real economy.
From bust to bubble Instead, easy credit raised asset prices to levels
even higher than those prevailing before 2008. US house prices are now
8% more than at the peak of the property bubble in 2006, while its
price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in 2008 and in
1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great Depression. As
monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, another economic crisis
--- possibly more severe than the last, as the economy has become less
responsive to such blunt monetary interventions --- is considered
likely. A decade of such unconventional monetary policies, with very low
interest rates, has greatly depleted their ability to revive the
economy. The implications beyond the economy of such developments and
policy responses are already being seen. Prolonged economic distress has
worsened public antipathy towards the culturally alien --- not only
abroad, but also within. Thus, [another round of [economic stress is
deemed likely to foment]{.mark} **unrest**, **conflict**, even
**[war]{.mark}** as it is **blamed** on the **foreign**]{.underline}.
International trade shrank by two-thirds within half a decade after the
US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, at the start of the Great
Depression, ostensibly to protect American workers and farmers from
foreign competition! Liberalization's discontents Rising [economic
insecurity, inequalities and deprivation are expected to strengthen
ethno-populist and jingoistic nationalist sentiments, and
**increase**]{.underline} social **[tensions]{.underline}** and turmoil,
especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or
threatened. Thus, [ethno-populist inspired chauvinistic [**nationalism**
may exacerbate tensions]{.mark}, [leading to
**conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} and tensions [among countries, [as in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[19[30s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[**Opportunistic leaders** have been **blaming**]{.mark} such
**misfortunes** on **[outsiders]{.mark}**]{.underline} and may seek to
reverse policies associated with the perceived causes, such as
'globalist' economic liberalization. Policies which successfully check
such problems may reduce social tensions, as well as the likelihood of
social turmoil and conflict, including among countries. However, these
may also inadvertently exacerbate problems. The recent spread of
anti-globalization sentiment appears correlated to slow, if not negative
per capita income growth and increased economic inequality. To be sure,
globalization and liberalization are statistically associated with
growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism. Declining real
incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently strengthened
ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening economic
liberalization itself, both within and among countries. Insecurity,
populism, conflict Thomas Piketty has argued that a [[**sudden
increase** in]{.mark} income [**inequality**]{.mark} is often followed
by a **great crisis**]{.underline}. Although causality is difficult to
prove, with wealth and income inequality now at historical highs, this
should give cause for concern. Of course, other factors also contribute
to or exacerbate civil and international tensions, with some due to
policies intended for other purposes. Nevertheless, even if unintended,
[such developments [could]{.mark} **inadvertently [catalyse]{.mark}
future [crises]{.mark} and conflicts**]{.underline}. Publics often have
good reason to be restless, if not angry, but the emotional appeals of
ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are leading to chauvinistic
policy measures which only make things worse. At the international
level, despite the world's unprecedented and still growing
interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed as
the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist policies
without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual allies.
Avoiding Thucydides' iceberg Thus, protracted economic distress,
economic conflicts or **[[another]{.mark} financial
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[could lead to **military
confrontation**]{.underline}]{.mark} by the protagonists, [[even if
**unintended**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Less than a decade after the Great
Depression started, the Second World War had begun as the Axis powers
challenged the earlier entrenched colonial powers.

#### Scenario 2 -- Iran -- China will retaliate to Taiwan arm sales by selling arms to Iran and undercutting sanctions -- that causes Israeli strikes 

**Lin 09** (Christina Lin, Ph.D. is research consultant for IHS Jane's
and former director for China affairs in policy planning, Her 2008 paper

East" published by the Korea Economic Institute, was recently referenced

<http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=35633&cHash=9ceadb72aa#.VgsIDXpVhBc>)

Indeed, China has used its arms trade with Iran to entangle its
**[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** relations over Taiwan. For example, on 2
September 1992, President Bush [[announced the sale
of]{.underline}]{.mark} 150 [F-15 [**fighters** to **Taiwan**, and China
**immediately threatened** to sell]{.mark}]{.underline} M-11
[[missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} [to **Pakistan**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [components [to **Iran**.]{.mark} China contends that
F-16 and missiles were both arms proliferation, and the U.S. has **no
right** to play a double standard]{.underline}. The U.S. protested that
M-11 missile components violate China's commitments to MTCR guidelines
and parameters, while China riposted by stating that F-16 sales to
Taiwan violate the 1982 Joint Communiqué dealing with U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan (The Washington Times, October 4, 1994). Over subsequent years,
[[Chinese officials **repeatedly evoked** the **Taiwan-Iran linkage** to
justify its **continued arms proliferation to
Iran**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[8\]. According to Professor Shi Yinhong,
the director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University in
Beijing, \"China will do its utmost to find a balance ... dilute it
\[sanctions\], to make it limited, rather than veto it\" (New York Time,
September 30). [[Given its]{.underline}]{.mark} Persian Gulf
**[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** standing [[as the **Great Wall of
China**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[blocking]{.mark} the road]{.underline}
toward **[[future sanctions on Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[this will
present **serious challenges** for **Israel** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
for [[the **global nonproliferation regime**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Challenges [for]{.underline} Israel and global nonproliferation regime
For Israel, given the grim prospect of sanctions, inability of the Six
Powers to arrest Iran's nuclear weapons development, impending delivery
of the S-300 anti-aircraft system, and increasing Israeli perception
that the United States would not support **[Israel]{.underline}**, [the
military option remains **on the table**]{.underline}. In March 2009,
the Center for Strategic and International Studies released a study on
possible Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without U.S.
support \[9\]. The first scenario consists of three possible routes of
Israeli air-force strike, with the highest political risk but the lowest
operational risk via a southern route over Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
Iraqi airspace. The second scenario consists of a ballistic missile
attack, the Jericho III, capable of carrying a 750 kg nuclear warhead
and a range that covers the entire Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia,
and almost all parts of North America \[10\]. Yet, given the increasing
complications of an air strike, some Israeli defense analysts posit that
a more realistic military option is a nuclear missile strike \[11\].
[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} **[Israel]{.underline}** is forced to act
alone, and [[the **international community** is unable to **stop**
Iran's nuclear weapons aspirations,]{.mark} a **nuclear strike** in the
Middle East would be a disaster]{.underline}. Israel almost used nuclear
weapons (The Samson Option) during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when 13
twenty-kiloton atomic weapons were assembled and the Middle East
teetered on the edge of a nuclear strike \[12\]. With the current
Iranian nuclear program, [[the **Middle East**]{.underline}]{.mark} once
again [[finds itself **teetering** on the edge of a **nuclear
strike**]{.underline}]{.mark} as the sand clock nears empty before Iran
acquires breakout capability or Israel launches its nuclear missiles.
**[Thus]{.underline}**, **[[unless China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, along
with Russia, [[unite with the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[remaining]{.underline}]{.mark}** six
**[[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to accelerate **effective
sanctions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to arrest Iran's]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[illicit nuclear]{.mark} weapons [program]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[this may lead to a cascade of **destabilizing nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline} [the **Middle
East** and **East Asia**]{.underline}. If [China]{.underline} wants to
maintain a new energy silk road with Iran in the long term, it would
[need to]{.underline} act soon and **[remove itself]{.underline}** [as
an **obstacle**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} immediate and **[effective
sanctions on Iran's nuclear program]{.underline}**.

In May, President Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** announced that
he was pulling the United States [out of the Iran nuclear
deal](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2018-05-10/strategic-disaster-leaving-iran-deal).
A few weeks later, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
[[[outlined](https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/05/282301.htm)
the]{.mark} administration's **[aggressive]{.mark}** [new Iran
policy]{.mark}, which was designed to prevent the country's emergence
from isolation.]{.underline} [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy, the
Trump administration believes, [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[force
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[return to the
table]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and make a "bigger and better" deal that
addresses the president's concerns with the existing
agreement]{.underline}. For Tehran, a full economic recovery and renewed
ties with Western countries now seem unlikely. But [this doesn't mean
that the Trump administration's plans will succeed]{.underline}. For the
better part of two decades, **[[Iran's leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[has been **hedging**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[against]{.underline}]{.mark} [international [isolation by
developing]{.mark}]{.underline} **[deeper [ties with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Russia. Today, [[as Washington]{.mark}
once again [seeks to **tighten the screws**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[Tehran sees its]{.underline}]{.mark} [[relationship with
**Beijing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as **key to remaining
afloat**]{.underline}]{.mark}. China has announced it will likely
[continue importing
oil](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-expects-china-to-buy-even-more-iranian-oil-after-sanctions-1531833475)
from Iran, even after the United States moves to cut down Iranian oil
sales down to zero by November. And **[[Chinese engagement with
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[might pave the **ground** for others to
**follow suit**, which would **undermine the new U.S. pressure
campaign.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese officials often characterize
their relationship with Iran as "20 centuries of cooperation," but the
two countries' contemporary partnership began in the final days of
monarchical rule in Iran. In August 1978, the chair of the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP), Hua Guofeng, traveled to Iran---the first time
that a Chinese communist leader visited a non-communist country.
Although the Islamic revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi just
a few months later, Hua established a basis for cooperation that would
outlast the shah. After the revolution, Hua quickly made amends with the
new regime by apologizing for his earlier visit and expressing his
desire for greater ties with the Islamic Republic. After the Iran
hostage crisis and the country's subsequent international isolation,
China became a vital partner. During the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted
from 1980 to 1988, China was a key arms supplier to the Iranians. And in
the decades that followed, it slowly but surely established itself as a
major player in Iran's economy, trade relations, foreign policy, and
military affairs. In the mid-2000s, [[when the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [and
its partners [began **ramping up sanctions**]{.mark}]{.underline} in an
effort [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[curtail Iran's nuclear
program]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[undermined U.S. efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by providing the
struggling country with economic relief]{.underline}, a direct channel
to the UN Security Council, and military support. This relationship was
mutually beneficial. China saw Iran as a major source of energy and an
important market. Iran's position at the crossroads of the Middle East,
South and Central Asia, and Europe, along with its access to the Persian
Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, made it significant to China's vision of
integrating these key regions through infrastructure and transportation
projects designed to expand Chinese political and economic influence.
Although China supported UN sanctions against Iran in 2010, it continued
to engage the Islamic Republic and, by doing so, capitalized on the
Middle Eastern country's isolation. As other international suppliers and
companies withdrew, Chinese goods and services flooded Iran's market.
Iranians welcomed China's continued cooperation at a time in which no
other nation (except for Russia) was willing to engage. The bilateral
relationship further picked up with the announcement of the [One Belt,
One Road
initiative](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-02-16/backlash-belt-and-road),
in which Iran plays an important role. Still, these ties stopped well
short of a strategic alliance. Both states wanted to pursue their own
interests without jeopardizing ties to other relevant players. China, in
particular, did not want its support of Iran to harm its relationship
with the Western powers. Although the two countries maintained a
pragmatic partnership, over time the relationship began to sour. By the
time that nuclear talks resumed in 2012, Iranian consumers had come to
see Chinese products as subpar and the political elite deemed Beijing
untrustworthy. During the period of international sanctions, Iran
[struggled](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/feb/20/china-floods-iran-cheap-consumer-goods)
to meet the needs of its population and often had no choice but to turn
to China, which faced no competition on the Iranian market. As a result,
Iran became flooded with low-quality Chinese products. But the quality
of the products wasn't the only Iranian grievance with China. Chinese
involvement in Iran didn't create jobs; instead, Iranians watched as
Chinese workers replaced them on various projects that had been
outsourced to China, even as unemployment rates continued to climb up in
Iran. Iranians were also frustrated with the conditions and pace of
business. For example, they complained about the slow progress on the
construction of the Tehran metro and cancelled a contract with China's
national oil company in 2014 due to recurring delays. The nuclear
negotiations, which began in 2012, offered Iran an irresistible
opportunity to diversify its suppliers and reestablish trade links and
political ties with other countries, in particular those in Europe. The
Iranian public and leadership alike were keen to open their country up
to the West. Still, many Iranians urged caution and called for the
government to maintain good ties with China in case things did not work
out. The events that followed would prove them right. [Trump's election
made it clear to Iran that it couldn't turn away from
China]{.underline}. **[Trump]{.underline}** had made his disdain of the
nuclear deal known throughout the presidential campaign. And after
months of heated rhetoric and push and pull within the administration,
he **[put the deal on life support]{.underline}** [by announcing the
U.S. withdrawal]{.underline}. CHINA\'S GROWING ROLE Today, [as the
United States pressures other countries and businesses to leave the
Iranian market]{.underline} and to stop importing Iranian oil,
**[[Tehran is hoping that Beijing will shield it]{.underline}]{.mark}**
from greater economic harm. [[At the moment]{.underline}, **[China is
assessing its options]{.underline}**]{.mark}. On the one hand, Chinese
businesses do not want to be found in overt noncompliance with U.S.
sanctions. They have become more global, which means that they are more
vulnerable to U.S. pressure than they were in the past. And Washington
hasn't hesitated to investigate and sanction Chinese companies such as
the telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE for doing business with
Tehran. Still, Iran [has
reason](https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/05/17/10222902/market-intelligence-china-iran-petrochemicals-trade-insulated-from-us-sanctions/?redirect=english)
to remain optimistic. Major Chinese companies remain actively involved
in Iran and many of them are poised to take over as European businesses
pull out. For example, China continues to invest heavily in the Iranian
railway and energy sectors. In July 2017 [China agreed to
invest](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/126722/Iran-China-ink-contract-to-electrify-Tehran-Mashhad-railway)
\$1.5 billion to electrify the Tehran-Mashhad railroad. China is more
flexible on payment processes, having used bartering in the past, and
its efforts to become less dependent on the U.S. dollar by using its
national currency to pay for oil imports are intended to create a
bulwark against U.S. economic pressure. This means that Chinese-Iranian
economic ties and trade will likely continue, even as the Trump
administration levies new sanctions.

**Israeli strikes cause extinction**

**Avery 13** (John Scales Avery, Associate Professor, University of
Copenhagen, November 6, 2013. "An Attack On Iran Could Escalate Into
Global Nuclear War," <http://www.countercurrents.org/avery061113.htm>)

Despite the willingness of Iran\'s new President, Hassan Rouhani to make
all reasonable concessions to US demands,
**[[Israeli]{.underline}]{.mark}** pressure groups in Washington
continue to demand [an [attack on Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. But such an
attack [[might **escalate** into]{.mark} a **[global nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} with catastrophic consequences. As
we approach the 100th anniversary [World War I]{.underline}, we should
remember that this colossal disaster [escalated uncontrollably from what
was intended to be a [minor conflict]{.mark}. There is a danger that an
attack on Iran [would **escalate into**]{.mark} **a [large-scale
war]{.mark} in the Middle East**, **entirely [destabilizing a
region]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is already deep in problems. [The
unstable government of [**Pakistan** might be overthrown, and]{.mark}
the revolutionary Pakistani government might enter the war on the side
of Iran, thus **[introduc]{.mark}ing [nuclear weapons]{.mark} into the
conflict**.]{.underline} [**[Russia and China]{.mark}**, firm allies of
Iran, [might]{.mark} also [be **drawn in**]{.mark}]{.underline}to a
general war in the Middle East. [Since much of the world\'s oil comes
from the region, such a [war would]{.mark} certainly [cause]{.mark} the
price of oil to reach unheard-of heights, with **[catastrophic effects
on the]{.mark} global [economy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the dangerous
situation that could potentially result from an attack on Iran, [[there
is a **risk**]{.mark} [that nuclear]{.mark} [weapons would be
used]{.mark}, either intentionally, or [by **accident or
miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation**]{.underline}. [Recent research has shown
that besides making large areas of the world uninhabitable through
long-lasting radioactive contamination, **[a nuclear war]{.mark} [would
damage global ag]{.mark}riculture** to such a extent that a global
famine of previously unknown proportions would result.]{.underline}
Thus, [nuclear war is the ultimate ecological catastrophe. **[It could
destroy human civilization]{.mark} [and]{.mark} much of [the
biosphere]{.mark}.** To risk such a war would be an unforgivable offense
against the lives and future of all the peoples of the
world]{.underline}, US citizens included.

However [the **continuous sales** to Taiwan by the US have been much to
the chagrin of]{.underline} the People's Republic of
**[China]{.underline}** ([PRC) who hopes to one day reunite with
Taiwan.]{.underline} In certain cases the [PRC has responded by securing
military relations and taking extreme diplomatic measures to dissuade
the US from continuing with sales to Taiwan. Even with such responses by
the PRC, these stern remarks appear to have no effect on the decisions
of the United States]{.underline}. **[[The US has not only continued to
provide Taiwan with weapons, but has also increased the amount]{.mark}
of arms exported to Taiwan over the past decade.]{.underline}** From
2001 to 2004, the US delivered US\$3.7 billion and from 2005 to 2008
US\$3.9 billion worth of weapons to Taiwan.3 To further this trend, on
January 29, 2010, the US announced that it would be selling US\$6.4
billion worth of weapons to Taiwan.4 [Not only have attempts by the PRC
failed in preventing sales to Taiwan, **but it also appears that the US
is ramping up the amount of weapons that they sell**]{.underline}.
[[What is]{.mark} most **[striking]{.mark}** about this new declaration
[is]{.mark} not the amount that the US has promised, but [the **new
reaction** that China is taking]{.mark} to influence US decisions in
sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. In response to the announcement by the US,
**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}** curtailed military exchanges with
Washington and, for the first time, **[[announced the possibility of
sanctions on the US corporations involved in the arms
sale]{.underline}]{.mark}**.5 [[This]{.mark} list of US corporations
[includes]{.mark} Northrop Grumman, **[Boeing]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
United Technologies (UTC), [Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon - all of which
are defense corporations in the United States]{.underline}.6 To ensure
that these corporations understand the severity of the claims against
them, [the Chinese Foreign Ministry]{.underline} spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu,
[directly threatened the corporations involved by stating]{.underline}:
"Some [US companies, which ignore the stern objections of the Chinese
government and decide to sell weapons to Taiwan regardless, will face
sanctions]{.underline}."7 [Instead of a typical retaliation on the just
the US Government, the Chinese have turned their focus on the US
corporations involved]{.underline} in the deal **[and are prepared to
hold them accountable if they continue with the decision of the US
Government]{.underline}**. To best understand what the PRC spokesman
meant by the threatened "sanctions", one must analyze how China can
effectively employ pressure on US corporations. The overarching goal of
any corporation is to maximize profit. For China to effectively place
pressure on US defense corporations they must have a viable means by
which to enact profit constriction and, therefore, must have a
vulnerable target to attack. Initially, one would be inclined to believe
that China has neither of these capabilities considering that US defense
corporations are highly protected by the US Government and, being that
China is not allowed to buy US weapons, the PRC is not part of the US
defense market. So exactly how can China impose effective sanctions on
the US defense sector? To answer this question this research paper will
first analyze the different forms of protection and decipher whether
international norms and regulations would prohibit or allow such
sanctions. By analyzing the existing forms of protection for the US
defense corporations, vulnerabilities can be detected and legitimization
can be shown in the threatened "sanctions". The next section will
analyze the business structures of these five corporations and highlight
their alarming level of dependency on civilian revenue and therefore the
China market. I argue that although the defense sectors of the
corporations are highly protected, the civilian sectors of these same
corporations are open for attack and depend on the Chinese market for
future sales and growth. By analyzing Boeing in particular, it can be
shown that US defense corporations have already been under political
pressure by China and stand to lose major competitive ground if China
were to enact sanction or cause problems for these corporations. [The
information presented]{.underline} in this paper [should serve as an
example of exactly how China can create effective and legitimate
pressure on US defense corporations and]{.underline} therefore **[serve
as a warning to US strategists that sales of weapons to Taiwan can and
will have problematic costs that may not have been
realized]{.underline}**. Are US Defense Corporations Vulnerable to
Foreign Sanctions? **[In response to the recent US arms sales to Taiwan,
the PRC has utilized the threat of sanctions as a form of
coercion]{.underline}**. [They have not only challenged the decision of
the US to sell weapons to Taiwan, but have also challenged the
corporations involved in the decision of the US Government]{.underline}.
[For the sanctions to have any teeth against these corporations, they
must have a viable means of being legally employed against the US
corporations involved. Their validity must be unhindered by global
institutions]{.underline} and unchallengeable by the international
community. This therefore calls into question whether or not the
international norms and regulations could allow China to invoke such a
serious action against US corporations. The unifying organization in
international economics is the World Trade Organization (WTO). Adopting
the provisions of the General Agreements to Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
the WTO strives to facilitate and foster liberalized trade amongst its
members. This international organization not only establishes a
framework for negotiations, but also provides a dispute resolution
process to ensure participants adhere to the WTO rules and regulations.
Considering that China and the US are both members of the WTO, it would
be through this organization that China would operate in placing overt
sanctions on another country. **[While sanctions by their very nature
are counter-intuitive to the overarching goal of the WTO, they are still
legal]{.underline}**. Article XXI of the GATT states: As can be seen,
Article XXI not only gives nations the clearance to immediately
interrupt trade relations, but it also allows the sanctions to occur
without being bogged down with the WTO dispute resolution process.9
Therefore China has the ability to levee sanctions on US corporations if
it is deemed necessary under the auspice of "essential security
interests". As officially published on the embassy website of the PRC in
the United States, Zhang Hanlin, director of the WTO Institute of the
University of International Business and Economics, stated: "As the
sales to Taiwan poses a threat to China's national security, China has
the right to penalize the companies."10 Considering that the sovereignty
of Taiwan is not recognized by the WTO, it would appear as though China
has a valid point in perceiving the sales to Taiwan as an illegal
transport or trafficking of arms into their own territory and therefore
can be considered a security concern for the PRC. Under the guidance of
Article XXI, China has a legitimate reason to believe the arms sales are
contrary to "essential security interests". Even though the WTO
resolutions would allow China to impose sanctions on these corporations,
exactly how could the PRC effectively sanction US defense corporations?
China, albeit a robust militarized nation, does not receive weapons from
the US. Following the Tiananmen Square Incident of 1989, the US
president, under the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act, placed
embargoes on military articles and services to the PRC. A mere twenty
days later the European Community enacted the same embargo on the PRC
and neither has lifted them since.11 Therefore China has no part in the
market of the defense sectors of the US defense corporations. The idea
in sanctioning is to impose large costs on products entering the
country; however, due to the decision of the United States, the PRC is
not an authorized nation to currently receive any weapons from the US.
They therefore have no means to attack these defense articles
considering they are not part of the US weapons market and can not
affect pricing or marketability. From this information it can be seen
that the threatened sanctions by the PRC appear not to be aimed at the
defense sectors of these defense corporations. Perhaps there is another
sector within the defense corporations that could be the target of the
threatened sanctions by the PRC. Whether or not Beijing places sanctions
on these corporations, the PRC must believe there is a targetable
weakness in the operations of current US defense corporations, otherwise
the threat could call China's credibility into question. A clue into the
possible target of the PRC was found in a public statement by the
Chinese Embassy in the United States which reminded the US Government
that China had never signed the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft and
therefore has the right to decide whether or not they purchase US
civilian aircraft from certain corporations.12 The Agreement on Trade in
Civil Aircraft is a WTO agreement entered into force in 1980 that
attempts to mitigate import duties on all aircraft with the exception of
those purchased for military use.13 This agreement also extends to
aircraft parts, components and flight simulators. Because China refused
to sign this agreement, they are therefore free to place import duties
on all foreign civilian aircraft and components, thus allowing them to
affect the cost and competitiveness of certain foreign corporations that
are involved in the sector. [While Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman,
and Raytheon take part in certain components involving civilian
aircraft, they are small compared to the level of investment that Boeing
has in this sector. This therefore appears to be a **direct threat**
against a civilian sector that is part of a **US** defense
corporation]{.underline}. Does this mean that civilian sectors of the
defense corporations are vulnerable to sanctions by the PRC? What Makes
the Civilian Sector an Easier Target? By their very nature, the defense
sectors of the US defense corporations are intertwined with the US
Government. Unlike civilian corporations, because of the sensitively of
their products to US security, they are under high supervision and are
highly scrutinized by the government. Over the years, the US has
installed many programs, regulations, laws, and supervisory boards to
help control the export of US defense articles to foreign countries. One
of the most significant defining measures to ensure such actions take
place is the US code Title 22, Chapter 39, which outlines the arms
export controls.14 According to Subchapter III, §2778 of Chapter 39, the
US president has direct control on all exports and imports of defense
articles and can provide foreign policy guidance to those designated to
receive US weapons or defense services. The president is also authorized
to determine what is designated as a defense article or a defense
service, thereby controlling the export of everything deemed 'US
weapons'.15 The decision of whom the defense sector can sell weapons to
is not the corporation's but the US President's. Unlike defense
articles, [products of the civilian sector are able to flow across
borders relatively unchecked. The freedom of commerce allows civilian
sectors of the defense corporations to extend their supply chain
logistics across oceans without the prior approval of the US president
as it is with the defense sector]{.underline}. [The internationalization
of these products allows for the civilian sectors of the defense
corporations to create efficiencies in production]{.underline}, increase
economies of scale, **[and access new markets]{.underline}**.16 These
corporations are becoming integrated within foreign national borders and
becoming accustomed to their way of life. Because of the pure
competitiveness of other international civilian corporations, it has
almost become a necessity for the civilian sectors of the defense
corporations to internationalize in order to maintain their competitive
edge.17 [Because of their freedom to integrate with the global markets,
the civilian sectors of the defense corporations are not as protected as
the defense corporations]{.underline}. In response to rising questions
over governmental control of civilian operations, a top defense
executive stated, "The best thing government could do for our
international business would be to get out of the way."18 [However as
the civilian sectors become internationalized, they have opened
themselves up to new dynamics]{.underline}. [The continued operations in
foreign countries create new pressures and difficulties for these
corporations]{.underline}.19 As the civilian sectors of the defense
corporations venture into new markets they deal with new laws, customs,
and market demands. Plagued by different desires in different countries,
the civilian sectors of the defense corporations have worked hard and
responded to ensure maximization of profit regardless of their host
national ties. There are ever-growing fears that, while defense
corporations have host nations, their allegiance to their host nation
may weaken due to continued operations in the world market. Analysts
generally agree that, due to their dispersed productions and competitive
international nature, corporations will fight any restriction on their
ability to globalize and reap benefits, even if this is to the chagrin
of their host nation.20 These notions and observations serve to
highlight the fact that [the ties between the civilian sectors of the
defense corporations and their host nation have in fact thinned as they
continue to globalize]{.underline}. Dealing with new governments,
pressures, and international competition, the civilian sectors of the
defense corporations are more likely today to act against host national
interests than when they were autarkic and located solely within
national borders. This only gives a sense of reality that, because of
the existence of the unprotected and unregulated civilian sectors of the
defense corporations, there exists the possibility that these
corporations under the right circumstances may acquiesce to foreign
national interests in hopes of increasing benefits and profits. An
example of this will be explored later in this research. Therefore [the
continual operation of these corporations in multiple nations raises the
likelihood that political confrontation between the foreign nations and
the corporation may occur]{.underline}.21 As can be seen, the defense
corporation is composed of two major components: the defense sector and
the civilian sector. Each has a different market to respond to. The
defense sector answers to the United States and only works with foreign
governments if the US President allows it. However, the civilian sector
can be just as engrained in a foreign market as it is in the US market.
Its products and supply chains still flow across borders and into new
territories. Regardless of their differences, **[both sectors are tied
together in that they are still part of the same corporations with the
same goal of maximizing profit. If China were to place effective
sanctions on the civilian sectors of the defense corporations, it would
still hurt the same defense corporation involved in selling weapons to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. An important observation in assessing the true
connection between these two sectors of the defense corporations is that
of Jonathan Galloway who addresses, among many things, the global
implications of defense corporations by differentiating the driving
mechanisms for these corporations.22 He explains that the basic needs
and interactions between defense corporations are different based on
their level of dependency on foreign sales and operations. Defense
corporations that depend more on foreign sales than military sales are
more apt to react to foreign market pressures.23 However, while this is
true, he highlights that even if civilian operations are only a fifth of
a corporation's revenue, the defense corporation cannot stand to lose
that income and is more likely to work harder to maintain it despite it
being a smaller part of the corporation's overall revenue. Therefore he
concludes that all defense corporations are dependent to some extent on
the three markets: governmental, foreign, and domestic civilian. He
argues that these defense corporations will take any action necessary to
preserve the balance among these markets regardless of their individual
percentages.24 Galloway states: "It stands to reason that their
managements will be interested in preserving the dynamic equilibrium
between these markets. If the equilibrium between these markets is
upset, then the consequences for the firm may become unacceptable."
Coupling the arguments of Galloway with the arguments that civilian
operations are graying the connection to nationalism as they
internationalize, one can start to see the plausibility in defense
corporations acting to mitigate sanctions from a foreign country like
China. This sort of situation is not an unlikely scenario considering
that defense corporations in the past have been caught between their
host nation and foreign national interests. The well-documented
Boeing--McDonnell Douglas merger highlights this very argument. In 1997,
Boeing made a bold move to buy and merge with their long-standing US
rival, McDonnell Douglas, another US defense corporation that
specialized in aerospace manufacturing and defense contracting. Although
the US authorities had approved the merger, the European Union (EU)
ruled that the merger was not in the EU's best interests and demanded
that Boeing make changes. Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are based
out of the United States; however, the EU was concerned that the
combined power of the two companies would hinder the European
aeronautics corporation, Airbus. Since Airbus is 80%-owned by EADS and
20%-owned by BAE (both of which are defense corporations of the EU) it
was speculated that such a merger would cause Boeing to gain a larger
competitive edge and would hurt their own defense corporations in the
long run.25 In their defense, Boeing first argued that the US Federal
Trade Commission, not the EU, should take the lead in investigating the
deal and its legitimacy. The EU, however, went forward with its own
commission and unanimously voted that the merger be blocked by any means
necessary. Faced with the threat of EU pressure to band together and
only buy planes from Airbus, Boeing acquiesced to the concerns of the EU
and changed the conditions of the merger so as to satisfy the EU.26 Even
though the United States demanded that Boeing maintain its original deal
and had a legitimate reason for stating that the original terms were
fair, Boeing feared the loss of market share in Europe and, therefore,
believed the foreign government's interests were in their own best
interests. This incident is significant for several reasons. First, this
showcases how an international organization was able to pressure two US
corporations to conform to their interests and not act solely on the
interests of the corporation. They were able to create enough pressure
on Boeing to ensure that Boeing conceded to their desires. It was not
the fear of losing defense contracting, but the fear of losing sales in
commercial jets that ultimately caused Boeing to acquiesce to the
desires of a foreign nation. Second, as mentioned above, the rest of the
world perceived this move by the EU as a way to protect the European
corporation Airbus. This was not because Boeing did not make a good
product. It was because of nationalistic reasons that differentiated
Airbus from Boeing, which is a dynamic that foreign defense corporations
must fight hard to resolve and overcome. Still, the most important point
is that the deepening of integration into other parts of the world due
to internationalization over the years has transferred more regulatory
powers from host authorities to foreign nations. Companies like Boeing,
Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and UTC will find that
their civilian actions, regardless of how small, will invite the
attention of the international world and cause great political pressure.
Or, in the case of the Taiwan arms sale, the action of their defense
sector will invite foreign political pressure and hardship on their
internationalized civilian sector. How Invested are Defense Corporations
in the Civilian Sector in China? Considering that all the defense
corporations from the Taiwan arms sale are multinational in their
civilian operations and have civilian sectors that extend across the
globe, [China has an ability to sanction portions of the exposed
civilian sectors of the defense corporations]{.underline}.27 Therefore
to be able to understand the effectiveness of such sanctions it is
important to register how much these defense corporations rely on their
civilian sectors and how much of a role China plays in the calculations
of their future prospect. In analyzing the chart below, one can see that
**[both [Boeing]{.mark} and UTC [show a large reliance on their civilian
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to their financial data, [both
companies rely heavily upon their civilian sectors' total revenue to
**maintain operations**]{.underline}. Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman,
and Raytheon have a significant amount of civilian revenue; however,
their business structure does not rely as heavily on civilian revenue
and would therefore not be in major jeopardy if sanctions were imposed
on their civilian sectors. This is not to say that their civilian
revenue is insignificant; the lowest percentage is 7%, which equals
US\$2.3 billion. **[For [Boeing]{.mark} and UTC, 49% and 83% are
significant enough that these corporations depend on civilian revenue
just as much if not more than on their defense revenue and [would
therefore be extremely vulnerable to Chinese
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This highlights that these two
companies stand to lose more than the other three due to their extreme
reliance on civilian revenue.29 [Both Boeing and UTC have been a part of
the American business structure for almost 100 years, but only recently
started shifting attention to conducting business transactions
overseas]{.underline}. They have seemingly found the rich potential that
lies within China's borders and over the past couple of decades, have
developed long-term relations with the Chinese government. Each one has
found their own niche in China's economy with Boeing selling commercial
aircraft to the Chinese airlines and UTC selling Otis elevators and
Carrier brand heating and air-conditioning to the Chinese people.30
**[For Boeing a complication in the Chinese market would severely hurt
their civilian revenue]{.underline}**. Over the next two decades, Boeing
expects China to spend US\$400 billion to purchase approximately 3,770
planes from certain manufacturers, thereby making China the second
largest commercial aircraft market in the world.31 According to UTC's
CEO, Louis Chenevert, "\[China's market\] feels really good right now."
Chenevert added that he sees no evidence of China's market slowing down
and noted that the company's Otis elevators were up by double digits.
Furthermore, orders for its Carrier air conditioning systems were
"starting to come up." For UTC, the revenue from Otis Corporation
accounted for the bulk of the US\$3.1 billion in sales in China last
year, and it is estimated that China's economy will grow 9.9% this
year.32 With results and high expectations for both companies and a
large reliance on their civilian sector's total revenue to maintain
operations, it appears as though **[these two defense corporations have
a large reliance on the civilian Chinese market and would therefore be
highly vulnerable to Chinese sanctions on their civilian
products]{.underline}**. If China does impose the threatened sanctions
against these defense corporations it could prove to be detrimental to
their international operations. While the military sectors of these
defense corporations would not be affected by sanctions from China, the
civilian sectors are left relatively unprotected. The combined dynamics
of a large reliance on civilian revenue and pressure from a government
that has a lucrative market for their civilian sectors to operate in
only demonstrates a larger possibility that certain defense corporations
will be more likely to adhere to the foreign government's will over that
of their host national government's desires. [Another way in which China
can exploit a major weakness in certain civilian sectors of the defense
corporations is through pre-existing competitive rivalries]{.underline}.
In most cases, [Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, UTC, Northrop
Grumman, and other defense corporations are in tight contention for
defense contracts relating to their respective fields;
however,]{.underline} as was discussed in a previous section, China does
not have an ability to affect this. [There are pre-existing rivalries in
the civilian sectors that can be exploited to create even more pressure
on the defense corporations involved in the Taiwan arms sale. The
**targeting** of corporations with strong rivals can]{.underline} serve
two purposes: it can [cause civilian revenue of the defense corporations
to **decrease**, and it can increase the competitive gain of their key
competitor]{.underline}. **[Not only do they lose that part of the
market, but their competitor also ends up gaining from it, thereby
delivering a double blow to the defense corporation under
fire]{.underline}**. [In tight competition for new markets like China,
this sort of altercation can result in a major setback to the defense
corporation's civilian revenue and could become a long-term
effect.]{.underline} Not only does the rival gain from a sanction in
China, but also, due to the increased capital, will he have the ability
to use this gain in other competitive areas to help increase funding in
his global market. There are many different types of rivalries that
exist in the market. Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman
mainly compete with each other for defense contracts and their civilian
revenue is relatively low compared to others. This indicates that they
are somewhat protected from a Chinese exploitation of their key
rivalries. Conglomerate corporations might have several different rivals
by the existence of multiple sectors and markets under which they
operate. Therefore no one company is completely identical to that of
another conglomerate corporation and the existence of a specific rivalry
is rare. UTC is a conglomerate that has different civilian sectors like
Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners.33 The sanctions against UTC
would result in fewer Otis elevators and Carrier products; however,
there are many different elevator and air-conditioner companies
operating in China and therefore no specific competitor would gain from
such sanctions. This does not affect the global competitiveness of the
civilian sector of UTC; rather it affects local competitiveness in the
Chinese market. With this in mind, it is fair to say that the sanctions
will not make UTC as vulnerable. [Boeing]{.underline} on the other hand
[has one major rival, Airbus.]{.underline} As most would claim, [the
rivalry between Boeing and Airbus is the largest international rivalry
in the world]{.underline}.34 Both companies are identical in that their
civilian sectors develop comparable commercial aircraft that are
competitive on the global market. Foreign corporations that choose to
buy a commercial jet are usually considering whether or not they choose
Airbus or Boeing and at times will use the two corporations to play each
other off in a bidding war. **[[The stakes are extremely high]{.mark}
for each corporation, meaning that [a single deal with an airline could
be a deciding factor between success and failure]{.mark} in a
multibillion-dollar investment]{.underline}**.35 Therefore one of the
best strategies for both Boeing and Airbus is that of persuading
prospective buyers, such as nationally owned airlines, to purchase their
own planes instead of those of the respective other.36 **[[The
competition between Boeing and Airbus has been extremely tight]{.mark}
over the years]{.underline}**. Neither company has been able to pull
away from the other[, **[so the slightest change in their global market
share can give a company]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[an advantage over the
other]{.underline}**. For such a close race it can be seen how important
the Chinese market is to both companies. According to China's own
projections, they believe they will quadruple their aircraft fleet to
3,900 by 2025, which could create a large amount of potential revenue
for Boeing or Airbus.37 To further this, Boeing expects China to spend
over US\$400 billion to purchase planes over the next couple of years,
thus making China the second largest aeronautics market in the world.38
According to Airbus China President Laurence Barron, China "probably has
the most potential of any significant market in the world".39 However,
despite tight contention, is Boeing at a point where it can handle a
head-to-head challenge with Airbus in China, especially if sanctions by
the Chinese government are enacted? With airlines in other markets
struggling and Boeing still trying to recover from its muchdelayed
Dreamliner 787 project, [Boeing seems to be on **[shaky
grounds]{.mark}** and stands to lose more than Airbus]{.underline}.40 To
make matters worse, before the arms sales to Taiwan, Airbus was already
winning more orders from China than Boeing.41 While Boeing currently has
736 Boeing planes operating in China (and another 30 from
McDonnell-Douglas, which Boeing acquired in 1997), Airbus only has 547.
However, over the past couple of years, Airbus's orders from China have
dramatically shifted to give Airbus the advantage. As of February 2010,
Chinese airlines have placed orders for 358 Airbus planes and have
options for another 14, while they have only ordered 244 new planes from
Boeing and have placed no options for further units. Airbus has also
acquired letters of intent towards future sales of 60 planes, compared
to 40 for Boeing.42 [Because the three largest airline companies
(]{.underline}China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China) [are still
controlled by the Chinese government, the purchasing of commercial
airliners is highly politicized. Because of this, Chinese officials have
the direct ability to reward foreign governments with airplane sales
that meet the interests of China]{.underline}.43 In response to such a
system, Airbus, in June 2008, built an assembly base in Tianjin.44 By
developing an assembly factory in Tianjin, Airbus is hoping that
building aircraft in China (and the corresponding transfer of
technology) will strengthen its position with the Chinese government,
effectively beating out Boeing. To further this, Airbus has also
developed an engineering center in Beijing that will train up to 200
local engineers to assist in the plant operations in Tianjin.45 Peter
Harbison, executive chairman of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation in
Sydney noted that in China, "if you allow for more local production and
information-sharing, the purchaser is going to be a lot more willing to
accept your aircraft".46 Boeing on the other hand is at a disadvantage.
Hindered by unions and concerns over the company shifting jobs overseas,
Boeing has had to maintain production in the US. However, Boeing has
argued that their presence in China is significant because Boeing buys
parts from seven local manufacturers in China. Boeing spokesman, Yukui
Wang, stated that Boeing is the Chinese aviation industry's largest
foreign customer. He stresses that over the years Boeing has bought
US\$1.5 billion in aircraft parts and services from China and that this
figure "will double in the next few years".47 Mr. Wang also added,
"Chinese suppliers now have a role in all of Boeing airplanes".48 Along
with this, to emphasize their commitment to China, Boeing ramped up its
efforts and sent a sales director to Beijing to become the company's
first Chinabased sales executive - something that is not normally
practiced by Boeing.49 Even with the past level of competition between
Boeing and Airbus, [[**Boeing** is]{.mark} now [at a **large
disadvantage** because of their defense]{.mark} sector's [sales]{.mark}
of the Harpoon missiles [to **Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[If China enacts]{.underline} the [sanctions against Boeing, Boeing will
have to face a strong rival who just became much stronger]{.underline}.
This is while they simultaneously lost major ground in the battle over
the Chinese market. [Even if China does not impose the sanctions, the
Chinese government will probably be more likely to purchase planes from
and support a company that does not sell weapons to areas of concern as
well as one that complies with their interests]{.underline}. The defense
corporations that are more reliant on their defense sales and therefore
are not as competitive in the civilian sectors (e.g. Raytheon, Northrop
Grumman, and Lockheed Martin) are not under the same kind of pressure to
expand their international production base and depend on foreign markets
as is Boeing (due to its competitive nature with Airbus). If [China were
to enact sanctions against Boeing they would be able to meet their
aeronautical needs by buying planes from Airbus]{.underline}, who is
Boeing's tight competitor. Not only is Boeing losing the revenue, but
their main competitor is gaining from the sanctions. This double-edged
sword would increase pressure on Boeing to try and mitigate the
sanctions and adhere to the Chinese request, thereby restoring their
share of the world market and their political favor in the eyes of the
Chinese. As can be seen from this report, **[[the threats of sanctions
by China are]{.mark} quite [real]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
**[China stands in a position in which they have the capability and
means to legally sanction US defense corporations for their involvement
in the sales of weapons to Taiwan]{.underline}**. [While provisions and
laws of the US government protect the defense sectors of these
corporations, their internationalized civilian sectors are vulnerable to
separate sanctions and pressures from the PRC]{.underline}. To further
this point, [those defense corporations that rely heavily on civilian
revenue appear to be even more vulnerable to Chinese pressure because of
the potential of the Chinese market]{.underline}. **[Boeing displays the
most characteristics that make it vulnerable to pressure from the
PRC.]{.underline}** In their direct statement about not signing the
Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, **[it appears as though China is
aware of this fact and is directly threatening Boeing]{.underline}**
with this statement. **[[With]{.mark} a highly politicized process of
procuring orders and [an ever-tightening competition in China between
Boeing and Airbus, Boeing can ill afford the repercussions of the arms
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[They will not only lose the potential
revenue of the Chinese economy, but will also lose ground to their major
competitor, Airbus]{.underline}**. In response to the threat of
sanctions, David Wang, President of Boeing in China, stated that "[any
arms sales to foreign countries or entities are decided by the US
government \[...\] It's a governmentto-government issue]{.underline}".50

#### **And, Boeing is the key to U.S. Aerospace -- that's key to the U.S. Manufacturing base** 

**Platzer 09**(Michaela D. Platzer, Specialist in Industrial
Organization and Business, "U.S. Aerospace Manufacturing: Industry
Overview and Prospects," https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40967.pdf)

[[The]{.mark} large commercial [jet aviation market is]{.mark} a
**duopoly** [shared by]{.mark} the U.S. aircraft manufacturer
**[Boeing]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the European aircraft
maker]{.underline} [**[Airbus]{.mark}**, with fierce competition between
these two companies.]{.underline} The regional jet market is dominated
by two non-U.S. headquartered manufacturers, Brazil's Embraer and
Canada's Bombardier, both of which utilize a high level of U.S.-produced
content in their products. The general aviation market includes
companies such as Cessna and Gulfstream. **[[Aerospace manufacturing is
an important part of the U.S. manufacturing base]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[It comprised]{.mark} 2.8% of the nation's manufacturing workforce in
2008 and employed [over]{.mark} **[500,000]{.mark}** Americans in
[highskilled]{.mark} and high-wage [jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}. More than
half (61%) of the nation's aerospace industry jobs are located in six
states: Washington state, California, Texas, Kansas, Connecticut, and
Arizona. Several smaller aerospace manufacturing clusters are found in
states such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Missouri, and Alabama. Other
aerospace centers are beginning to emerge in southern states, such as
South Carolina, where Boeing is now building a second production line to
produce the 787 Dreamliner. [Aerospace manufacturing contributes
significantly to the U.S. economy]{.underline}, with total sales by
aerospace manufacturers (including defense and space) [comprising 1.4%
of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2008]{.underline}. **[[U.S.
aircraft manufacturers depend heavily on the international market for
their sales]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The aerospace industry sold more
than \$95 billion in aerospace vehicles and equipment (including defense
and space) to overseas customers in markets such as Japan, France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom, and imported over \$37 billion in
aerospace products from abroad, providing a significant positive
contribution of \$57.7 billion to the U.S. trade balance in 2008.
Increasingly, [other markets are becoming important as an opportunity to
increase U.S. sales,]{.underline} [but also because of the potential for
future competitors to challenge the U.S. aerospace industry's
competitive position. U.S. aerospace exports to China have increased
since 2003]{.underline}, totaling \$5.5 billion in 2008. At the same
time, some analysts maintain that China could become a global competitor
in the commercial aerospace market. Already, China is working to develop
airplanes that could become globally competitive in both the regional
jet and large commercial jet aviation market. Russia has stated that it
wants to become the world's third-largest aircraft manufacturer by 2015.

In short, the fiscal and political reality is that the United States
will again undergo a post-war defense budget reduction of the type that
has followed every major war in its modern history. The numbers remain
to be resolved, but the most likely scenarios are that the annual
resources available to the military and the wider defense industrial
base will decline significantly over the coming years. The magnitude of
this reduction will feel dire to a Defense Department and industrial
base that have known only growth in spending for the last decade. But it
is not unusual by historical standards. Indeed, the budgetary starting
point of more than \$700 billion is in fact substantially higher than 2
peak spending in past periods including the Korean War, Vietnam War, and
Reagan defense buildup. The Obama budget proposal of early 2012 would
take the base budget back to near 2007 levels---a steep drop to be sure,
especially when combined with much larger percentage cuts in war
spending, but not an historical anomaly. [Yet there are severe
challenges that could result to the nation's security
interests]{.underline} even with 10 percent cutbacks. [Despite the
likely potential of lesser resources, the demand side of the equation
does not seem likely to grow easier. **[The international security
environment is challenging]{.mark} and complex**.]{.underline}
[[China's]{.mark} economic, political and now military rise
continues]{.underline}. Its [[direction is
uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it has already raised tension,
[especially [in the **S**]{.mark}]{.underline}outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea[.]{.underline} [[**Iran's**
ambitions]{.mark} and machinations [remain foreboding]{.mark}, with its
nuclear plans entering a new phase of both capability but also crisis.
**[North Korea is]{.mark} all the more [uncertain with a leadership

and indeed even the occasional use of force against the South, not to
mention nuclear weapons related activities that raise deep
concern.]{.underline} And the hopeful series of revolutions in the
broader Arab world in 2011, while inspiring at many levels, also seem
likely to raise [uncertainty in the broader Middle East]{.underline}.
Revolutions are inherently unpredictable and often messy geostrategic
events. On top of these remain commitments in Afghanistan and beyond and
the frequent U.S. military role in humanitarian disaster relief. Thus,
there are broad challenges for American defense planners as they try to
address this challenging world with fewer available resources. The
current wave of defense cuts is also different than past defense budget
reductions in their likely industrial impact, as the U.S. defense
industrial base is in a much different place than it was in the past.
Defense industrial issues are too often viewed through the lens of jobs

### 2AC\-\--AT: Invasion Turn

#### Taiwan arms sales INCREASES risk of war

**Xiangwei 18** (Xiangwei is the post-editor in chief for the South
China Morning Post), "Are The US and China Headed For War Over Taiwan",
https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2142674/are-us-and-china-headed-war-over-taiwan

Are the Chinese mainland and Taiwan headed down an inevitable path to
war -- one that is likely to see the United States join the fray? This
slow-burning question came to the fore again last week when the mainland
launched live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday amid fiery
rhetoric from Chinese state media. On Thursday morning, Chinese state
media started to post online videos of helicopters and warships firing
at targets at sea but Taiwan dismissed the exercises as "routine". This
came after President Xi Jinping had presided over a massive naval parade
off Hainan island a week earlier, one that involved 48 warships
including China's sole operating aircraft carrier and more than 10,000
servicemen -- the largest such exercise since the founding of the
People's Republic in 1949. PLA submarines, naval vessels and fighter
jets accompany China's aircraft carrier Liaoning on exercises in the

was sending a loud and clear warning to Taipei and Washington amid
heightened tensions caused by Taiwanese leaders' open advocacy for
independence and increased American support for the Taiwanese
government. Over the past few weeks, Chinese officials and state media
have ratcheted up the rhetoric against Taipei and Washington, the
largest supplier of arms to the island.]{.underline}** Trump's trade war

live-fire drills, Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to US, warned in a
lecture at Harvard University that China would try every possible means
to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Earlier this month,
a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said any outside forces that
attempted to "play the Taiwan card" would find their efforts "futile"
and would hurt themselves if they went "over the line", according to the
official China Daily. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen speaks on the

was clearly aimed at US President Donald Trump and his administration
which in recent months has taken a number of significant steps to warm
ties with Taipei. **[As Beijing and Washington are currently positioning
themselves for a possible trade war, Trump's intention to play the
Taiwan card again is even more dangerous because this would further
destabilise bilateral ties or even worse, could lead to a real
war.]{.underline}** A nasty US-China fight is inevitable. But it needn't
be terminal True to Trump's unconventional and unpredictable presidency,
he first started to play the Taiwan card in the transition to the White
House when he took a congratulatory call from the Taiwanese president
Tsai Ing-wen, breaking a nearly 40-year-old diplomatic protocol
governing China-US ties. At that time, Trump made it clear his intention
was to use Taiwan as a play to force more concessions on trade from
China. His suggestion then was overwhelmingly met with criticism and
cynicism almost everywhere, even in Taiwan where it raised concerns that
the island could be used as a pawn and discarded easily. **[China sees
Taiwan as a province and usually reacts strongly to any foreign country
having official contacts with the Taiwanese government or sale of arms
to the island, particularly from the United States.]{.underline}** Now
one year later, Trump's intention to play the Taiwan card again signals
a much broader agenda targeting China. Almost all the moderating voices
in his administration have been forced out and replaced by more hawkish
officials including the soon-to-be secretary of state Mike Pompeo and
the National Security Adviser John Bolton -- both of whom are known for
tough stances against China and pro-Taiwan views. Tough on China: US

national security adviser John Bolton. Photo: Reuters Share: In recent
months, his administration has approved licences for American firms to
sell Taiwan technology to build submarines and signed the Taiwan Travel
Act to encourage visits between American and Taiwanese officials. All
these have invited protests from China. A major test will come in June
when the American Institute in Taiwan, the US de facto embassy, is
slated to move into a new building. There has been growing speculation
that Bolton or some other senior US official will attend the ceremony.
If that happens, Beijing will regard it as a major provocation. **[It is
interesting to note that amid the war of words with Washington over
trade, some elements in Beijing's propaganda machine have been using
warlike language to give the impression that China will not back down
from the trade spat and will fight the US to the very end. That could
well be a negotiation tactic, as trade issues are negotiable after all.
But from the Chinese perspective, the Taiwan issue is absolutely
non-negotiable. It is a clearly marked red line.]{.underline}** The
Taiwanese leaders, encouraged by the latest warming signs from
Washington, have started to openly advocate independence, which is a
major taboo for Beijing and seen as breaking the status quo. Over the
past 40 years, Beijing and Taipei have tried to maintain the status quo
in which both sides recognise the island as part of China, even while
neither government recognises the legitimacy of the other. Taiwan agrees
not to broach independence, in return mainland China does not use force
to take over the island. Washington recognises this one-China principle
but maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan and provides the island
with arms under the Taiwan Relations Act -- a constant source of
friction with Beijing. Taiwanese Premier William Lai. Photo: EPA
Taiwanese Premier William Lai. Photo: EPA Share: This month, the
Taiwanese premier William Lai publicly described himself as "a political
worker for Taiwanese independence". Although this was not the first time
he has said this, Lai's latest declaration caused serious worries in
Beijing in the context of Washington's warming ties with Taipei. The
heightened tensions over the Taiwan Strait have come as Xi embarks on
his second term as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Last
month the national legislature repealed the term limits on the
presidency, enabling Xi to rule as long as he likes. With Xi trying to
assert China's power on the international stage, flexing China's
military muscle in the Taiwan Strait in the name of pushing back against
the independence movement is likely to bolster Xi's support on the
mainland. Chinese President Xi Jinping has been trying to assert
China\'s power on the international stage. Photo: AFP Chinese President
Xi Jinping has been trying to assert China\'s power on the international
stage. Photo: AFP Share: China's official line has always been that it
will seek peaceful reunification with Taiwan but not rule out using
force to take it over. In the past, officials and state media have
tended to emphasise the peaceful reunification part -- more recently
they have highlighted the bit about using force. Moreover, China has
never publicly stated a timetable for reunification with Taiwan but some
mainland analysts have started to preach the idea that reunification
could take place by 2035 or 2050. As China beats its war drum, who
should hear its call? These assumptions stemmed from Xi's landmark
report at the Communist Party's 19th congress in October when he
outlined a clearly defined timetable to realise what he called the
Chinese dream of national rejuvenation -- China would basically become a
modern country by 2035 and a world power by 2050. For an ambitious
leader like Xi, reunification with Taiwan has to be an integral part of
the dream. So will the US join the fray if push comes to shove? Many
people have mistakenly assumed the Taiwan Relations Act requires the US
to come to Taiwan's defence. In fact, the law contains no explicit
guarantee. Besides, there is a big question over whether the US would
risk waging a full-blown war with China over Taiwan. **[In the short
term, if the current trend continues with the US determined to play the
Taiwan card -- which in turn helps embolden the pro-independence
movement in Taiwan -- China will probably feel compelled to accelerate
its military preparations and increase the frequency of military shows
of strength like the one last week. All this means that tensions over
the Taiwan Strait will get much worse unless Trump rethinks his plan to
play the Taiwan card.]{.underline}**

#### Arms sales to Taiwan undermine Taiwan's own defense industrial base

**Grady 19** John Grady, a former managing editor of Navy Times, retired
as director of communications for the Association of the United States
Army. His reporting on national defense and national security has
appeared on Breaking Defense, GovExec.com, NextGov.com, DefenseOne.com,

Experts Say New Arms Sales to Taiwan answer defense needs but spur new
questions

[A pending sale]{.underline} of F-16 fighters, Abrams tanks, anti-armor
and anti-aircraft missiles, to Taiwan drew rebukes from Beijing
but [also set off alarms on the island about its ability retain talent
and develop home-made defenses, one of its leading security experts
said]{.underline} Wednesday. I-Chung Lai, president of the Taiwan-based
Prospect Foundation, said [the large arms, aircraft and ship sales of
the 1980s and again in the 1990s inadvertently set off "a brain drain"
from the island and threatened its defense industrial
base]{.underline}. "Our capabilities and talents started to filter away"
to Korea, he said while speaking at the Heritage Foundation.
Shipbuilders and engineers started working for businesses and industries
in Korea that were direct competitors with Taiwan but also "filtered
into civilian industries," especially in technology where the island's
expertise is well-respected. "How can we avoid these things happening
again," Lai asked? [Aside from considering what such sales do to the
Taiwanese industrial base, another question is whether these the right
weapons Taipei needs to defend itself from an aggressive
Beijing]{.underline}. Scott Harald, from RAND's Asia-Pacific policy
center, said the danger is Taiwan's believing it needs a "one to one"
match with China in weapons and systems. [Instead,]{.underline} Harald
suggested [the island needs "dynamic, agile, survivable, lethal" forces,
not]{.underline} necessarily [airfields and ports that would be subject
to long-range Chinese missile or air strikes, to deter or defend against
an all-out assault]{.underline}. Taiwan should consider truck-based
anti-ship missile systems, air-launched cruise missiles, mines,
helicopters armed with anti-armor missiles to attack landing craft, fast
attack missile boats "over big shiny thing" that costs billions, Harald
said. Taiwan also needs to decide what type of submarine is necessary;
one built domestically or bought overseas. Meanwhile, Taiwan needs to
assess the current and future levels of military threats. China already
operates its navy east of Taiwan and routinely flies strike aircraft
around the island. Taiwan must understand whether China could mount a
cross-strait invasion and provocations and incidents similar to the late
1970s confrontations between China and Vietnam. Taiwan also needs to
understand Beijing's short-term goals beyond Taiwan and determine
President's Xi Jin-ping's timeline for achieving reunification with the
mainland, Harald and Lai said. "Is the fight primarily in the heads of
people?" of Taiwanese citizens, leaders of foreign nations and
international organizations, Harald asked. Szu-chien Hsu, Taiwan's
deputy minister for foreign affairs, said Beijing's military intent is
clear and it is "breaking through the First Island Chain," closest to
mainland China to achieve its "very evident ... global strategic
ambitions" of being the leading superpower.

#### A strong Taiwan defense industrial base solves deterrence better 

**Bandow 15** (Doug, is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. He is a
former special assistant to President Ronald Reagan and the author of
several books, including Foreign Follies: America's New Global Empire;
"Arm Taiwan, America. But Don't Defend
It." <http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/arm-taiwan-america-dont-defend-it-14695?page=2>,
12/21/15)

Indeed, the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity has become more dangerous
as China's power has increased. [Taiwan matters much more to the PRC
than America.]{.underline} Thus, as a Chinese general not so
subtly argued, [the United States won't risk Los Angeles for
Taipei]{.underline}. Indeed, it would be madness for America to do
so. [It might seem equally foolish for China to risk]{.underline},
say, [Shanghai to regain Taiwan. But]{.underline} it is far more
plausible that the PRC might do so. [Enabling Taiwan to defend itself is
the best way out of this conundrum]{.underline}. So long as the
residents of Zhongnanhai value prosperity and stability, they have
reason to avoid costly conflict. [No arms sales would enable Taipei to
defeat a determined PRC in war]{.underline}. The former's objective,
however, should be deterrence, not victory. "The idea is to complicate
China's scenarios, to make them pause, to get them to think twice before
they attack," explained Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council. The higher the price any PRC government
would pay for attempting to coerce Taipei, the less likely it would try
to do so. Continued patience would remain good sense. That doesn't mean
there won't be costs to the U.S.-China relationship as a result, but
they are worth bearing. There's likely diplomatic turbulence. In the
past military meetings have been suspended, though only temporarily.
There could be economic retaliation, though the threat seems overblown:
defense companies are barred from supplying the PRC and sanctions
against civilian sales would hurt the PRC as well.

#### Arms sales don't solve -- they're ineffective and don't deter chinese aggression -- causes china lashout

**Hua 15** (Zhang, assistant research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan
Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Arms sales to Taiwan do not

[Washington]{.underline} has to accept it [is becoming]{.underline}
**[far less capable]{.underline}** [of containing China\'s
rise.]{.underline} It may upset the government of the Chinese mainland
by making a fuss with Taiwan, but it won\'t have a real effect.
[Washington\'s primary intent in forging a military relationship with
Taiwan is to maintain military balance across the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}. **[However, the strategy is stretched too
thin]{.underline}**. Given the mainland\'s swift and prominent ramp-up
in military spending, a [**military balance can no longer be stricken
between the mainland and Taiwan, no matter how many advanced weapons the
US sells to Taiwan.** The possibility of using Taiwan to suppress the
mainland\'s growing leverage in its periphery is vanishing. The
mainland\'s economic aggregate is more than 20 times larger than
Taiwan\'s, so the latter has no chance to engage in a military race with
the former. **Selling arms to Taiwan doesn\'t mean Washington would hold
on to its promise to \"come and rescue\" Taiwan when the island is in
trouble with the mainland. It is not even a commitment to include Taiwan
in its umbrella of protection**]{.underline}. Even some Taiwanese
strategists have pointed out that Taiwan is too obsessed with the
delusion that Washington will come all the way to defend Taiwan.
[Washington]{.underline} also cunningly [argues]{.underline} that the
[weaponry deal will bolster Taiwan\'s confidence]{.underline} when it
needs to negotiate with the mainland in other respects. In fact, in such
talks, [it is always the mainland that makes more room for Taiwan\'s
wellbeing, **not because Taiwan has a strong military capability that is
feared by the mainland**, **but because the mainland regards Taiwan as
family.**]{.underline} Although the US, especially its arms enterprises
and political brokers, could reap fat profits from such practices, these
companies and individuals might risk losing the second biggest market.
The pros and cons are not hard to weigh. In fact, some companies have
started to reflect on the deal. [Washington seems to have gone on the
offensive in the arms deal, **but Beijing can find opportunities to
strike back.**]{.underline} From the Diaoyu Islands to the South China
Sea disputes, the US keeps stirring troubles against China in recent
years during the implementation of its \"rebalancing to Asia\" strategy.
China could have resorted to countermeasures but is too prudent to take
real action. On the occasion of this arms deal, for which the US has
neither moral nor legal ground, Beijing should take the chance to carry
out down-to-earth countermeasures, such as halting bilateral
communications over military matters and sanctioning relevant US
enterprises. It becomes increasingly obvious that playing the **[Taiwan
card is no longer an effective approach to countering China\'s
rise]{.underline}**. On the contrary, it makes Washington take bigger
risks to jeopardize a relationship with the Chinese mainland, which is
clearly more important. The **[US government must have realized that it
is necessary to reduce the harm caused by arms sales]{.underline}**.
During President Barack Obama\'s administration, the US government
slowed down the frequency of arms sales to Taiwan. The last four years
has seen just two arms sales. Besides, Washington knows the mainland\'s
red line, and decided not to fulfill Taiwan\'s request for sensitive
weaponry such as submarines and F-16 C/D fighters. Given that Taiwan\'s
strategic significance is diminishing, to abandon it or not has raised
years of debates in the US. High-level military and government officials
and well-known academic experts have also expressed their concerns that
arms sales to Taiwan are not helping the US gain a competitive edge. In
the short term, the US won\'t stop selling arms to Taiwan, let alone
abandon it. But the mainland\'s rise will eventually make the US realize
that **[arms sales to Taiwan are not helping Washington.]{.underline}**

#### China is substantially stronger than Taiwan and no amount of arms sales is going to change that 

**Jianing 15**- Yao, writer, America\'s arms sale to Taiwan won\'t
change cross-strait strength landscape,
(<http://eng.mod.gov.cn/Opinion/2015-12/18/content_4633208.htm>)

The [U.S. will sell 10 types of military equipment worth 1.83-billion
U.S. dollar in total to Taiwan,]{.underline} including the Perry-class
frigates, announced the U.S. on the early morning of December 17, 2015.
[Chinese defense ministry and foreign ministry voiced strong opposition
immediately]{.underline}, and vowed to sanction American enterprises
that sell weaponry to Taiwan. The [new arms deal came four years after
the U.S. sold weapon to Taiwan last time in 2011.]{.underline} The arms
sale this time isn\'t on a large scale compared with previous deals, but
its nature is as bad as ever. [The mainland\'s military strength has
long surpassed that of the Taiwan military by a landslide.]{.underline}
**[No matter how much American weaponry Taiwan buys, it won\'t change
the disproportional strength landscape across the strait.]{.underline}**
Already out of service in the U.S., the Perry-class frigate is
\"out-dated\" maritime equipment, so the new [arms deal is more a
tribute paid by Taiwan to the U.S. in exchange for the latter\'s
commitment to \"protecting Taiwan\"]{.underline} than an arms contract
in the real sense. On the one hand, the U.S. makes money by selling arms
to Taiwan. On the other hand, it uses the arms sale to encourage Taiwan
to uphold the idea of consolidating its security with armed forces,
which will cement the military stalemate across the strait and suppress
those in Taiwan who believe in ensuring Taiwan\'s long-term security
through peaceful communication with the mainland. The U.S. is paving the
way for \"Chinese fighting Chinese\". [Given Taiwan\'s limited finance,
it\'s impossible for it to independently launch a military confrontation
against the mainland. The possibility of the U.S. waging an all-round
war against the mainland in order to \"protect Taiwan\" is an ever
shakier trump card]{.underline} for Taiwan\'s \"national defense\". [As
the mainland\'s military strength has developed steadily, the price of
the U.S. engaging in the cross-trait conflict is rising every year. The
American military is losing its \"sure win\" against the]{.underline}
Chinese People\'s Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) in case a conflict
broke out across the Taiwan Strait, and the most symbolic aircraft
carriers of the U.S. Navy cannot approach the strait during a war as
analysts said they have to stay 2,000 km away from the Chinese coastline
to keep themselves safe. [In the past, Taiwan\'s military strength was
only slightly weaker than the mainland\'s and the U.S. was able to
deploy much stronger forces in the West Pacific than China, but this
\"balance\" has been disrupted.]{.underline}

[Washington formally announced a]{.underline} \$1.83 billion [arms sale
package to Taiwan]{.underline} on Wednesday. [China slammed the
sale]{.underline} for interfering in its internal affairs and vowed to
impose sanctions on relevant American companies. [Chinese pundits see
this as new proof of Washington\'s desire to contain China by roiling
cross-Straits relations]{.underline}. In fact, **[arms sales to Taiwan

### 2AC\-\--AT: Appeasement Turn 

#### China doesn't need Taiwan for power projection

International Affairs and the Department of Political Science at George
Washington University. He is also a fellow in the Kissinger Institute at
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ("A U.S.-China

Taiwan's geographic location creates another possible military danger by
giving China the opportunity to deploy its forces further forward.90 For
example, Chinese control of Taiwan would provide China's navy more
direct access to the open Pacific, which might increase China's power
project capabilities.91 Chinese analysts identify the importance of
Taiwan for enabling China to "break through" the barrier created by
Japan, including the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and the Philippines.92 In a
similar vein, Toshi Yoshihara and James Holmes, of the U.S. Naval War
College, argue: "Control of Taiwan\... would allow the PLA to erect its
own Great Wall at sea, giving Beijing some say over the exercise of
foreign naval and military power in nearby seas and skies. . . .
Analysts view Taiwan as the one geographic asset that can grant Chinese
forces direct access to the Pacific. If the island is a guard tower in
an offshore Great Wall, then its offensive value is unmatched."93
Dissecting the strategic value of Taiwan requires assessing how Chinese
control would influence China's ability to perform specific military
missions. [Available analyses provide **little reason to worry** that
possession of Taiwan would **significantly increase** China's military
reach or its ability to **project power**]{.underline}.94 Control of
Taiwan would, however, enhance China's A2/AD capabilities by increasing
its ability to send submarines into the Philippine Sea. Owen Coté
explains that Taiwan plays an important role in enabling the United
States "to form effective acoustic barriers through which Chinese
\[diesel attack submarines/guided missile diesel submarines\] must pass
in transiting" from the shallow waters along China's coast into the deep
water of the Philippine Sea.95 This access is valuable because the
United States plans to operate carrier battle groups in the Philippine
Sea and Chinese diesel submarines would make these operations more
difficult and riskier. [The impact of losing this anti submarine warfare
barrier might **not be large**]{.underline}, however, b[ecause China
increasingly has a **variety of other ways** to threaten U.S. carrier
battle groups and undermine their effectiveness, such as antiship cruise
missiles]{.underline} that can be launched from a diverse array of
platforms (including guided missile diesel submarines), [systems
designed to counter U.S. space and cyber capabilities, and an emerging
antiship ballistic missile capability]{.underline}.96 Nevertheless, U.S.
carrier battle groups would experience some reduction in effectiveness.

have this effect, little sustained analysis of this issue is publically
available. One possibility is that [U.S. accommodation would free up
military forces]{.underline} and investments that China now commits to
coercing and if necessary attacking Taiwan, which would in turn enable
China to shift resource to better challenge the U.S. ability to protect
the East Asian SLOCs and possibly beyond.82 According to this argument,
because the Taiwan mission has absorbed the vast majority of the Chinese
army's force modernization and organizational training,83 the resources
made available for other missions would be large.84 [This **danger is
smaller than critics suggest**]{.underline}, however. If [China decides
to fully pursue more ambitious missions, it would have to make large
investments that would likely dwarf the amount it is spending on
Taiwan-specific missions]{.underline}. Consequently, [whether China
eventually gains control of Taiwan is unlikely to be decisive in
determining China's ability to invest in efforts to control the South
China and East China Sea SLOCs]{.underline}, and beyond. Related, it is
likely that Chinese capabilities dedicated to Taiwan will eventually
become so effective that Beijing will be able to reallocate some of its
future military investment to other missions.85 Moreover, [ending the
U.S. commitment to Taiwan could reduce China's determination to pursue
more challenging distant naval missions because the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will not interrupt these SLOCs]{.underline},
except possibly during a severe crisis or major war. [Eliminating the
possibility of war over Taiwan would therefore greatly reduce Beijing's
incentives to make investments in these missions]{.underline}. [China
could]{.underline}, however, [pursue greatly expanded power projection
capabilities for a variety of other reasons,86 including worst-case
planning that imagines the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[will interrupt its SLOCs]{.underline} under even the most unlikely
conditions, a Mahanian view of naval power that connects "commercial
health with naval primacy,"87 or the belief that superpower status
requires power projection capabilities.88 Finally, one should not
exaggerate the security risks of being unable to fully control these
SLOCs. The United States does not need to control the Strait of Malacca
and the East Asian SLOCs to enable shipping to reach Japan during a war
with China. Instead, bypass routes could allow shipping to reach oil
ports on Japan's east coast.89 Also, the ability to deny China use of
these SLOCs would be sufficient to preserve the U.S. ability to coerce
China.

[The first and foremost of the long-standing key assets for area denial
in the inventory of the PLA Navy remains its modernizing fleet of 59
attack submarines]{.underline}, to which new boats are still being
added. The submarines have increasingly [posed a grave potential threat
to the safety of U.S. carrier strike groups]{.underline}. Since 1995 the
Chinese submarine fleet has been upgraded by 28 modern vessels,
including 12 Russian-made Kilo-class boats.31 [The quality and
capabilities]{.underline} of the more recent indigenous submarines, such
as the Song- and Yuan-class boats, [have]{.underline} also improved
[dramatically]{.underline}.32 Indeed, a Song submarine surfaced within
five miles of the USS Kitty Hawk, inside its screen of escorts, in
October 2006.33 This put the carrier within range of anti-ship missiles
and torpedoes. However, [whether Chinese submarines can breach the
three-dimensional anti-submarine surveillance of a fully alert carrier
strike group in combat conditions remains uncertain]{.underline}.34 In
any event, [the increasing threat from the improving Chinese submarines
is one that the U.S. Navy has regularly taken into account in its
planning]{.underline}. Thus, at this point [the growing potential threat
still cannot deliver the deterrence that the PLA High Command may wish
to achieve.]{.underline} The most significant capability enhancement in
area denial that the [Chinese have been developing is a new anti-ship
ballistic missile]{.underline} (ASBM) system based on the DF-21D or
CSS-5 land-based mobile missile, [with a range of over 1,500
km]{.underline}.35 It is equipped with maneuverable re-entry vehicles
(MaRVs) capable of hitting moving ships at sea and has reportedly
reached the testing stage.36 [No other state has developed such a
capability.]{.underline} If it proves effective, it [will be extremely
difficult to defend carriers within its range. The deployment of such a
weapon system may require the U.S. to devote significant resources to
counter it.]{.underline} However, [the efficacy of an operational ASBM
system in deterrence remains doubtful. The vulnerability of carrier
battle groups may lead Washington to "pre-emptively destroy or disable
missiles or supporting assets" such as the satellites that guide the
missiles, instead]{.underline}.37 [It is unlikely that the PLA will
succeed in deterring the U.S. through this new weapon
system.]{.underline} For example, [firing a missile that deliberately
misses hitting a carrier battle group will probably escalate, not
deter]{.underline}. More likely, U[.S. forces will attack and eliminate
such a threat, whether it scores or not]{.underline}. Even though an
operational Chinese ASBM capability will be taken very seriously, [the
U.S. Navy has never shied from putting its capital ships in harm's way
if necessary.]{.underline} Furthermore, [alternative platforms such as
unmanned aerial vehicles can be deployed to perform some of the
functions now commonly carried out by carrier-based strike aircraft,
should the deployment of carriers become restricted.]{.underline} In any
event, how effective the Chinese ASBM system will be in knocking a
carrier out of action remains to be seen. Should the U.S. Navy find
itself fighting a war with the PLA, the prospect that America could lose
a carrier or more has been taken into account, similarly with the
possibility of a major battle with the Soviet Navy during the Cold War.
[Any idea that China, by crippling a carrier or demonstrating that it
can, will deter the U.S. armed forces from fulfilling orders to go to
Taiwan's defense is based on a **misreading of the ethos of the U.S.
military establishment.**]{.underline} On the contrary, if [a U.S.
carrier should become a "mission kill" or be rendered operationally
ineffective]{.underline} (even if not sunk[), this would have a huge
psychological, perhaps galvanizing, impact on the
Americans]{.underline}. The [U.S. Navy has not suffered such a loss
since the end of World War Two]{.underline}. [Such a blow]{.underline},
particularly if it resulted from a stealthy, preemptive strike, [is
likely to have a "Pearl Harbor" or "September 11" effect on U.S. forces,
spurring them to fight back]{.underline}. The [assumption that they
would withdraw]{.underline}, as after the 1993 "Black Hawk Down"38
incident in Somalia, [defies U.S. military tradition]{.underline}.
Whether the general public, and in particular the political
establishment, in the U.S. will react in line with the military
establishment in a crisis over Taiwan will depend on the political
reality at the time and cannot be predicted. But [in a real crisis,
"rally round the flag," persevere]{.underline}, and expect to win in the
end have long been part of the American ethos and national experience;
these are likely to be the default reaction.

[Some realist pessimists argue that in order to be highly secure, China
will find itself compelled to pursue regional hegemony, fueling conflict
along the way. However, China\'s size, power, location, and nuclear
arsenal will make it very challenging to attack successfully. [China
will not need to push the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[out]{.mark} of its region in order [to
be secure]{.mark}, [because a forward U.S. presence will not undermine
China\'s core deterrent capabilities. A major U.S.
withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}[, moreover, [would not automatically
yield Chinese regional hegemony, because Japan and South Korea might
then acquire stronger conventional]{.underline}]{.mark} [military
capabilities [and nuclear capabilities]{.mark} of their own, [greatly
reducing China\'s coercive potential. A Chinese drive for regional
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [[would be **both unnecessary

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' [forward military
presence does enhance its power-projection capabilities, which threaten
China\'s ability to protect its sea-lanes and coerce Taiwan. But [the

Taiwan\'s geographic location creates another possible military danger
by giving China the opportunity to deploy its forces further forward.90
For example, Chinese control of Taiwan would provide China\'s navy more
direct access to the open Pacific, which might increase China\'s power
project capabilities.91 Chinese analysts identify the importance of
Taiwan for enabling China to "break through" the barrier created by
Japan, including the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and the Philippines.92 In a
similar vein, Toshi Yoshihara and James Holmes, of the U.S. Naval War
College, argue: "Control of Taiwan ... would allow the PLA to erect its
own Great Wall at sea, giving Beijing some say over the exercise of
foreign naval and military power in nearby seas and skies. ... Analysts
view Taiwan as the one geographic asset that can grant Chinese forces
direct access to the Pacific. If the island is a guard tower in an
offshore Great Wall, then its offensive value is unmatched."93
Dissecting the strategic value of Taiwan requires assessing how Chinese
control would influence China\'s ability to perform specific military
missions. [Available [analyses provide **little reason to
worry**]{.mark} that [possession of Taiwan would significantly increase
China\'s military reach or]{.mark} its [ability to project
power]{.mark}]{.underline}.94 Control of Taiwan would, however, enhance
China\'s A2/AD capabilities by increasing its ability to send submarines
into the Philippine Sea. Owen Coté explains that [Taiwan plays an
important role in enabling the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
"[to form effective acoustic barriers through which Chinese]{.underline}
\[diesel attack submarines/guided missile diesel
[submarines]{.underline}\] [must pass in transiting"]{.underline} from
the shallow waters along China\'s coast [into the]{.underline} deep
water of the [Philippine Sea]{.underline}.95 This access is valuable
because the United States plans to operate carrier battle groups in the
Philippine Sea and Chinese diesel submarines would make these operations
more difficult and riskier. [[The impact of losing this
a]{.mark}nti-[s]{.mark}ubmarine [w]{.mark}arfare [barrier **might not be
large**]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[because China]{.mark}
increasingly [has]{.mark} a variety of [other ways to threaten U.S.
carrier battle groups]{.mark} and undermine their effectiveness, [such
as antiship cruise missiles]{.mark} that can be launched from a diverse
array of platforms]{.underline} (including guided missile diesel
submarines), [[systems designed to counter U.S. space and cyber
capabilities, and an]{.mark} emerging [antiship ballistic missile
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}.96 Nevertheless, U.S. carrier battle
groups would experience some reduction in effectiveness.

#### China is [not]{.underline} a revisionist power 

**Carpenter 13** (Ted Galen Carpenter, Senior Fellow for Defense and
Foreign Policy Studies and former Director of Foreign Policy Studies at
the Cato Institute, holds a Ph.D. in U.S. Diplomatic History from the
University of Texas, 2013 ("China as a Prickly, But Pragmatic,
Revisionist Power," *Aspenia*, January 17^th^, Available Online at
<http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/china-prickly-pragmatic-revisionist-power>)

Greater assertiveness on the part of a rising power, combined with
growing suspicions by the leaders of that country about the intentions
of the incumbent dominant power, is potentially an explosive mixture.
But it is important for US and East Asian leaders to view China's
ambitions and behavior in their appropriate context and respond
accordingly. [[China is not]{.mark} an [aggressively revisionist]{.mark}
power [the way]{.mark} that [Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or]{.mark}
even [Imperial Japan were. Beijing's goal is not to violently overthrow
the status quo]{.mark} and create a new international --- or even
regional --- order in which it is the undisputed hegemon]{.underline}.
For one thing, [[China benefits]{.mark} far [too much from the
current]{.mark}, relatively peaceful international [system]{.mark} that
has created unprecedented prosperity for the country. Chinese leaders do
not want to overturn the status quo; they merely seek to adjust some
provisions to China's advantage. In that crucial sense, [China is a
**pragmatic**, not]{.mark} an **[aggressive or revolutionary]{.mark}**,
revisionist power]{.underline}. [As a rising great power, today's China
most closely resembles Wilhelmine Germany]{.underline} ([or the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates) [in the late 1800s and early
1900s]{.underline}. But the experience with Germany should offer
cautionary lessons for both China and the countries that worry about
Beijing's behavior. [Britain, France and Europe's other leading powers
handled Germany's rise about as badly as could be imagined, culminating
in]{.underline} the tragedy of [World War I. But Germany was also to
blame for that outcome. Even when the substance of Berlin's position on
a particular issue was reasonable, the way German leaders asserted that
position was sometimes so prickly and abrasive]{.underline}, even
threatening, [that it alarmed Germany's neighbors]{.underline}. [[In
dealing with China's assertiveness, the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and the governments of East Asia [[must be
sufficiently accommodating so that they do not foster a **siege
mentality** in Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Xinhua article is one
indicator among many that [such paranoia lurks not far beneath the
surface]{.underline}. At the same time, Beijing must exercise far
greater patience and diplomatic finesse in pressing its territorial
claims. And, especially in the case of the South China Sea, it must
scale back those claims to more reasonable levels. [[Dealing with
China's]{.mark} geostrategic [rise does not have to produce]{.mark} the
same kind of [tragedy]{.mark} as did the rise of Imperial Germany. But
[avoiding that outcome will require]{.mark} mutual restraint and a
willingness by all parties involved to
**[compromise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Attempting to contain China is a greater risk of conflict -- Taiwan's the key point of containment

**Glaser 11** Professor of Political Science and International Affairs
and Director of the Institute for Security and Conflict Studies at the
Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington University
(Charles L., \"Disengaging from Taiwan,\" Foreign Affairs, July/August
2011,
[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2011-07-01/disengaging-taiwan)\\\\BPS](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2011-07-01/disengaging-taiwan)\\BPS)

Shyu-tu Lee\'s argument hinges on two key claims: that China does not
feel threatened by the United States and that China has essentially
unlimited geopolitical aims. Both are quite unlikely. First, [major
powers tend to see the military capabilities of their peers as
threatening]{.underline}, unless they share excellent political
relations. Although [China and the United States]{.underline} are not
enemies, they [do not have confidence that each other\'s motives are
benign. This is reflected in China\'s concern about U.S. ballistic
missile defense systems, the survivability of its nuclear force in the
event of a war, and the threat posed to its sea-based commerce and
energy imports by U.S. naval forces \-- which could sever China\'s
access to critical resources and render the country vulnerable to
coercion during a crisis over Taiwan]{.underline}. Second, although
experts disagree on China\'s motives, [the most common assessment is
that China places great value on Taiwan, some value on its ability to
prevail in regional maritime disputes in the East China and South China
seas, and little value on gaining other territory.]{.underline} Given
these judgments, [U.S. policies that simply seek to increase its ability
to project power in the Pacific could needlessly spark tensions with
China, heightening the possibility of conflict]{.underline}. Of course,
this forecast of China\'s goals could prove wrong. Consequently, the
United States must implement political concessions and military
restraint with caution, maintaining its alliances with Japan and South
Korea to provide a successful counterbalance. Lastly, [Lee\'s argument
about the increasing danger posed by China implies that maintaining the
U.S. commitment to Taiwan will be ever more costly and perilous. This
bolsters the case for a U.S. pullback.]{.underline}

#### US-China Relations are vital to deterrence credibility

**Glaser 11** - Charles L Glaser is a professor in the Elliott School of
International Affairs and the Department of Political Science at George

[Confidence in the U.S. deterrent is likely to be reinforced
by]{.underline} relatively [good relations between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China]{.underline}. Those
who feared that the United States could not extend its deterrent to
Western Europe believed that the Soviet Union was a highly revisionist
state bent on radically overturning the status quo and willing to run
enormous risks in the process. There is virtually no evidence suggesting
that China has such ambitious goals, so extending the U.S. deterrent
should be easier now than during the Cold War. And [even in the unlikely
event that China evolved into such a dangerous state, deterrence would
still be possible]{.underline}, albeit more difficult. Some realist
pessimists argue that in order to be highly secure, China will find
itself compelled to pursue regional hegemony, fueling conflict along the
way. However, China\'s size, power, location, and nuclear arsenal will
make it very challenging to attack successfully. China will not need to
push the United States out of its region in order to be secure, because
a forward U.S. presence will not undermine China\'s core deterrent
capabilities. A major U.S. withdrawal, moreover, would not automatically
yield Chinese regional hegemony, because Japan and South Korea might
then acquire stronger conventional military capabilities and nuclear
capabilities of their own, greatly reducing China\'s coercive potential.
A Chinese drive for regional hegemony, therefore, would be both
unnecessary and infeasible. The United States\' forward military
presence does enhance its power-projection capabilities, which threaten
China\'s ability to protect its sea-lanes and coerce Taiwan. But t[he
U.S. alliance with Japan also benefits China by enabling Japan to spend
far less on defense]{.underline}. Although the United States\' power far
exceeds Japan\'s, [China has seen the alliance as adding to regional
stability, because it fears Japan more than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. As China grows more powerful, it may increasingly
resent U.S. influence in Northeast Asia. But [unless U.S.-Chinese
relations become severely strained, China is likely to accept a
continuing U.S. presence]{.underline} in the region, given the
alternatives.

[Taiwan]{.underline} [is set to have its presidential elections in
January 2020]{.underline} --- and experts said the [**polls** **would**
likely **determine the direction of cross-strait ties.**]{.underline}
Grossman said that [if]{.underline} the incumbent [Taiwanese president
**Tsai Ing-Wen is re-elected**, which is "likely," cross-strait tensions
are **likely to escalate** further **from 2020 to 2024**]{.underline}.
Glaser from CSIS echoed that sentiment, adding that [if a candidate from
the **independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party** was elected,
China would ratchet up **military, diplomatic and economic
pressure**]{.underline}. "I think [the Chinese would be worried
that]{.underline} there's always this potential for things to go in a
very negative direction because the combination of [Trump being
president and the possibility that Tsai gets re-elected ... could really
**embolden Tsai to move toward the direction of
independence**]{.underline}," she added. According to Grossman[, the
**best hope for keeping tensions under wraps** would be if a **candidate
from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party** wins the next Taiwan
presidential race and **recognizes the "One China"**
policy.]{.underline} That said, Grossman added, [public opinion polling
in Taiwan has shown that voters will **not likely support the opposition
KMT**]{.underline} in doing so. "The Taiwanese have been observing how
China's 'One Country, Two Systems' approach has worked out in Hong Kong,
and it isn't too inspiring," Grossman added. A public opinion survey
conducted by the Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council in May also found
[that **83.6%** of Taiwan **opposes** Xi's "**one country, two
systems"** policy. Asked if an armed conflict was a possibility,
Grossman said: "Absolutely a risk]{.underline} --- albeit a small one."
However, he emphasized that he did not want to get anyone alarmed, and
highlighted that "those out there saying the risk is very high are
probably wrong." "I would say the risk has escalated under Tsai from
maybe a 1% to 5% chance of armed conflict," Grossman
added[.]{.underline} "But [that's]{.underline} still [uncomfortably high
considering that **China has nuclear weapons** and the **U.S.**, also
with nukes, would likely **intervene to save Taiwan**]{.underline} were
China to invade or attack the island." Similarly, Bucknell's Zhu said
that while the possibility of an escalation is always present, in
reality, "neither side wants to face military confrontation." However,
economic and diplomatic confrontations are "highly likely," he added.
That may come in the form of Beijing poaching the island's allies to
ramp up pressure on Taiwan as cross-strait tensions escaflate, he said.
"Economically, Taiwan is heavily dependent on the mainland market, so
China could restrict Taiwan's agricultural exports to the
mainland[**."** Washington should "carefully deliberate" its exchanges
with Taiwan and ensure the wrong signals are not sent to
Beijing,]{.underline} Glaser from CSIS pointed out. "[**China could
miscalculate** and think the United States would get involved in a
conflict, and that would really be a **very dangerous
situation**]{.underline}," she added.

[Continued US security ties with Taiwan, **and in particular US weapons
sales to the island**, have long been a source of tension in the
US-China relationship]{.underline}. The People's Republic of China
[(**PRC) found it unacceptable that Washington insisted on selling
weapons to Taiwan even after US-PRC normalization in
1979**]{.underline}; the Taiwan Relations Act, which contained explicit
references to continued US arms sales to Taiwan, further angered Chinese
leaders.1 [**Washington agreed** in a 1982 communiqué "**to reduce
gradually its sale of arms to Taiwan**" and promised that future arms
sales to Taiwan "would not exceed, either in qualitative or quantitative
terms,"]{.underline} those of recent years,2 [but the record of US arms
sales since suggests that the communiqué has had little constraining
effect on US behavior]{.underline}.3 **[US arms sales to Taiwan, in
turn, often provoke an angry Chinese response,]{.underline}** which
typically includes tough rhetoric and symbolic retaliation, such as
temporarily suspending US-China military-tomilitary dialogues.4 [US arms
sales to Taiwan have continued to generate frictions in US-China
relations even though relations between Taipei and Beijing improved
dramatically after the 2008 election of Ma Ying-jeou as president in
Taiwan]{.underline}. In early 2010, for instance, **[PRC officials were
"strongly indignant" after an arms sale announcement, calling the sale a
"gross intervention in China's internal affairs" that would have a
"serious negative impact" on bilateral relations]{.underline}**.5

More important, however, is that focusing on the quality of current
cross-strait relations overlooks two other less direct, but potentially
more significant, benefits of U.S. accommodation on Taiwan. First,
[**U.S. support for Taiwan is** one of the most important, possibly
**the most important,** policy-driven **sources of China\'s suspicions
about U.S.** motives and intentions. Although the United States does not
take a position on what the final outcome of the Taiwan issue should be,
China considers U.S. support of Taiwan a key source of "strategic
distrust.]{.underline}" A recent study by two leading authorities on
U.S.-China relations concludes that [**Beijing views U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan "as confirming American** arrogance and **determination to
interfere in China\'s domestic affairs**]{.underline} and to prevent
peaceful unification from occurring, thereby harming a
clearly-articulated Chinese core interest." In a similar vein, their
report argues that "[continuing to provide Taiwan with advanced weapons
... is viewed as pernicious in Chinese eyes and has added to suspicion
that Washington will disregard Chinese interests]{.underline} and
sentiments as long as China\'s power position is secondary to
America\'s."68 Nathan and Scobell conclude that "most Chinese see
strategic motives at the root of American behavior. [They believe that
keeping the Taiwan problem going helps the U.S. tie China
down.]{.underline}"69 Similarly, [a prominent Chinese analyst argues:
"The position the U.S. takes on the Taiwan issue determines the essence
of American strategy toward China, and thus determines the quality and
status of U.S.-China relations]{.underline}."70 Xu Hui, a professor at
China\'s National Defense University, holds that **"[U.S. policies
toward Taiwan have been]{.underline}** [and are **the fundamental cause
of some anti-American sentiment** among the Chinese public. ... I assure
you that a posture change of the U.S. policy on Taiwan will remove the
major obstacle for our military-to-military relations and also
strengthen Sino-American cooperation]{.underline} by winning the hearts
and minds of 1.3 billion Chinese people."71 [In short, ending the U.S.
commitment to Taiwan has the potential to dramatically improve
U.S.-China relations, which in turn could increase the possibility of
cooperation on other issues and reduce the probability of competition
and conflict.]{.underline}

<https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3004175/us-china-tensions-could-ignite-over-taiwan-former-officials>)

[Numerous former US officials have warned of a tense year ahead in
relations across the Taiwan Strait under an increasingly anti-China US
Congress and a whole-of-government approach advocating for closer US
ties with the self-ruled island.]{.underline} They include Susan
Thornton, a former top US diplomat for East Asian affairs, who is also
concerned that President Donald [Trump may lack sufficient understanding
of the sensitivity of cross-strait relations, which could quickly become
a flashpoint in US-China relations if not handled properly. Their
alarming assessment follows the Trump administration's tacit approval of
Taipei's request to buy more than 60 F-16V fighter jets]{.underline} --
a move Beijing has described as "extremely dangerous" -- and a flurry of
legislative and other support from the US for the island in the past
week. The activity in Washington comes hard on the heels of the first
participation by a US coastguard vessel in a 'freedom of navigation'
exercise conducted by the US in the Taiwan Strait. Last Tuesday [a bill
was introduced]{.underline} in the US Senate [requesting a government
review of its policy on Taiwan]{.underline} and an elevation of military
ties with Taipei. "Hardliners in the US are taking their political
grandstanding on Taiwan to new heights," said Thornton, who is now a
senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Centre, after
retiring from her diplomatic posting last July. "I expect there will be
[continuing defence sales]{.underline} but the legislation [is dangerous
and Trump has no understanding of this issue]{.underline}," she said. If
passed, the Taiwan Assurance Act would mandate a review by the US
president of the State Department's guidelines on US-Taiwan relations
and direct the Defence Department to include Taiwan in military training
exercises, as well as support arm sales to Taipei. The legislation
echoes an appeal for the US to revisit its one-China policy which was
made by Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, in an opinion
article published by The ﻿Wall Street Journal in early 2017 before he
joined the White House. "[The bill confirms that the Congress strongly
supports Taiwan politically, in part because the sentiment in Congress
is fairly anti-China]{.underline}," said Richard Bush, a senior fellow
at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. He is a former chairman
of the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto US embassy on the
island. However, Bush said that the bill's requirement of a Taiwan
policy review was "not unprecedented" and predicted the US government
would regard the other two items, aimed at furthering military ties, as
"a clear intrusion on the president's commander-in-chief powers and in
effect refuse to carry them out". In a US House of Representatives
hearing last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also vowed to take
more action on [the Taiwan Travel Act]{.underline}, which [was passed
unanimously by Congress early last year and permits high-level visits
between Washington and Taipei]{.underline}. Beijing has repeatedly
warned Washington to stop any official contacts and cut off all military
ties with Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province to be
taken back by force if necessary. [Washington has no formal ties with
Taipei, but remains its major arms supplier and is bound by law to help
defend the island.]{.underline} Last week, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen
addressed a Heritage Foundation event in Washington, via a live video
link, on US-Taiwan and cross-strait relations. She is scheduled to
deliver a second, similar speech to the US Centre for Strategic and
International Studies on April 9, a day ahead of the 40th anniversary of
the Taiwan Relations Act, the US law which has defined its relations
with the island since it switched sovereign recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in 1979. The message from Washington has been alarming enough to
prompt a former top White House official on Asian affairs to heap scorn
on the current Taiwan policymakers in the Trump administration. "[In
every corner of the \[current Trump\] administration, the wrong people
are calling the shots,]{.underline}" the former official said, on
condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. "These guys
think Beijing will just surrender on trade, Taiwan and technology,
whatever," the former official added. Edwin Feulner, founder and former
president of the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative
Washington think tank, said that the US and Taiwan should further their
"special relationship with increased practical cooperation", such as a
bilateral US-Taiwan free-trade agreement. "[The Trump administration is
more open to ways to demonstrate American support than any other
administration in recent memory]{.underline}," Feulner said. "[Support
in Congress for Taiwan from both political parties is higher than it has
been for more than 20 years]{.underline}." Derek Grossman, a senior
defence analyst at the Rand Corporation, said that "clearly the
[Trump]{.underline} administration -- [and]{.underline}, quite
significantly, the US [Congress]{.underline} -- [are fully on board with
bolstering US-Taiwan relations, to include in the defence
domain]{.underline}". Grossman said that Washington had been proceeding
with a "whole-of-government" approach to countering China in nearly
every dimension. "[This is likely to include more frequent and
higher-calibre arms sales to Taiwan and further integration of the
island into Trump's Indo-Pacific strategy]{.underline}," he said.

[**Given the tensions**---and the anger in Beijing---that are
**generated by US arms sales to Taiwan, some** in the United States
**propose that Washington end**]{.underline} (or at least scale back)
**[weapons sales to the island]{.underline}**. **[Doing
so]{.underline}**, proponents suggest, **[would remove a major irritant
in the US-China relationship and would increase trust and cooperation in
bilateral relations]{.underline}**.6 More fundamentally, proponents of a
reduced US commitment to Taiwan [suggest that such a policy approach
would help lower the risk of armed conflict in East Asia]{.underline}.
This argument is developed most fully by Charles Glaser,7 who [suggests
that ending the US commitment to defend Taiwan would bring with it two
significant benefits for the US-China relationship]{.underline}. First,
it could improve US-China relations because [**such a shift in US policy
would remove a key source of mistrust** in Beijing concerning US
motivations]{.underline}. Second, ending US support for Taiwan---by
[removing the key potential source of military conflict between China
and the United States]{.underline}---[**would reduce military
competition between Washington and Beijing**.]{.underline} Glaser thus
proposes a "grand bargain," in which the United States would end its
commitment to Taiwan in return for Chinese willingness to "resolve its
maritime disputes on 'fair' terms" and to accept a long-term US security
presence in East Asia. Others argue that the US commitment to Taiwan is
increasingly untenable as China's military power continues to grow. For
instance, Chas Freeman warns that a continued [US commitment to Taiwan
is incompatible with (a) waning US relative power in the region and (b)
the importance that the PRC places on the issue.]{.underline} A failure
to accommodate US policy to new geopolitical realities, in turn, risks
future military conflict over an issue about which China cares deeply.8
John Mearsheimer argues along similar lines that China's rise as a great
power, [if it continues, will mean that the current US security
commitment to Taiwan will be increasingly unsustainable.]{.underline}
Taiwan will ultimately be forced to accommodate growing Chinese power.9

this perceived threat to its sovereignty]{.underline}, [China stepped up
its legal and military pressure towards Taiwan]{.underline}, including
suspending regular diplomatic contact due to Tsai's refusal to endorse
the 1992 consensus since she took office. In April this year, the
National People's Congress Standing Committee passed a revised version
of China's surveying and mapping law intended to safeguard its claims in
the South China Sea and Taiwan. At the same time, China conducted
live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait, sending signals to both Taiwan
and the United States. China has moreover used its economic muscle to
show Taiwan its place by buying diplomatic recognition of smaller
countries. In 2018, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Burkina Faso
cut ties with Taiwan in favor of recognizing the One China principle and
establishing ties with Beijing. In another vein, the Chinese government
also demanded that foreign airlines revise their website references to
Taiwan to reflect China's claim on Taiwan.

US and China is playing out right under our noses, accessed 6/29/19,
<https://www.businessinsider.com/us-arms-sales-to-taiwan-bigger-threat-to-us-china-relations>)

The world has its eye on the trade war **[between the US and
China]{.underline}**, but [a more dangerous confrontation between the
two nations is playing out in the background: the worsening disagreement
over the \"One China\" policy.]{.underline} [Last
week, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-preparing-big-weapons-sale-to-taiwan-testing-china-sources-idUSKCN1T62CA) reported
that Washington was on its way to approving \$2 billion worth of arms
sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. The move indicates **[the Trump
administration isn\'t trying to create an atmosphere conducive to trade
negotiations and suggests that disputes between the US and China are
more likely headed toward escalation than resolution.]{.underline}**
\"[**Taiwan is the thing the Chinese care most about hands down**,\"
said Susan Thornton, a former assistant US secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs]{.underline}. \"[Anything where the US is
interfering with Taiwan hits a national third rail]{.underline}.\" [The
One China policy]{.underline} --- under which the US acknowledges
China\'s claim that Taiwan is not an independent nation but rather a
part of China, without taking a side --- was developed during the Nixon
administration to improve US-China relations. The idea [is central to
China\'s identity as a modern world power, and since President Donald
Trump took office the US has challenged that notion
repeatedly]{.underline}. [Despite protests from Beijing, Trump signed
the [Taiwan Travel
Act](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-signs-taiwan-order-despite-warnings-from-china-2018-3),
legislation permitting high-level talks between US and Taiwanese
officials]{.underline}, last year. In May, the US national security
adviser, [John Bolton, met with David
Lee](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3011978/rare-meeting-between-taiwanese-us-security-officials-angers),
one of Taiwan\'s top security officials. This meeting came just after
Taiwan renamed its unofficial embassy in Washington the Taiwan Council
for US Affairs. The old name, the Coordination Council for North
American Affairs, neglected to mention Taiwan or the US. [The Trump
administration has also sold arms to Taiwan before]{.underline}, as have
previous administrations, [but this \$2 billion arms sale digs at a
delicate wound during a delicate time. It\'s a big sale]{.underline},
even in a world where weapons are becoming more and more expensive. And
though it does not include the US\'s top fighter jets[, it is sure to
antagonize Beijing before the G20 meeting]{.underline} at the end of the
month in Osaka, Japan, where US and Chinese heads of state are expected
to meet. On Thursday, [a **Chinese Foreign Ministry representative**,
Geng Shuang, **responded to the news of the arms sale with a warning,**
according to the Chinese state media
outlet [Xinhua](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-06/06/c_138122583.htm).
\"**We urge the US side to stop arms sales to Taiwan and sever their
military ties, prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues, to
avoid serious damage to China-US relations as well as to the peace and
stability of the Taiwan Strait**,\"]{.underline} Geng said.

Washington knows how to do one thing well: pick a fight[. **Potential
sales**]{.underline} of F-16 fighter jets and M-1 Abrams tanks [**to
Taiwan is a sure fire way to tick off Xi Jinping**,]{.underline} the
Chinese president with whom Donald Trump is trying to sign a "great
trade deal" as early as this month. Following another Steve
Mnuchin/Robert Lighthizer lackluster showing in Beijing last week, all
bets are off that China and the U.S. sign anything should the two
presidents meet later this month as discussed. [**Taiwan is a new
sticking point**.]{.underline} The U.S. hasn't sold fighter jets to
Taiwan since 1992 in an effort to appease China, which sees Taiwan as a
breakaway province designed to sow political discord between Beijing and
the West. Last week, the [Trump administration responded to the
Taiwanese president's request for some of the biggest weapons made in
the U.S., saying he was fine with the order.]{.underline} The formal
request still needs congressional approval. Beijing will lobby hard
against it before Trump and Xi meet. No meeting date has been set.
**[Taiwan's request is an unwelcome risk for ongoing U.S. China
talks,]{.underline}** says Chris Rogers, a senior analyst for Panjiva,
the trade research division of S&P Global Market Intelligence. Taiwan's
president Tsai Ing-wen seems willing to ruffle feathers and challenge
Trump, asking for the F-16 and the M-1 tank in order to "show the world
the U.S. is committed to Taiwan's defense," Reuters reports. "[**Should
the U.S. approve the orders it would \... jeopardize relations between
the U.S. and China** just as trade talks are due to reach a
conclusion,"]{.underline} Rogers says. Defense contractors will love
this order. Those who would like to see the trade war end, won't love it
as much. Lockheed Martin builds the F-16V model that the Taiwan Air
Force is after. The M-1 Abrams tank is built by General Dynamics Land
Systems and is used in Iraq and Afghanistan. Panjiva analysis of
official figures shows that order approvals fell 16.6% year over year in
2018 to \$48.1 billion. That was the worst year for heavy defense
equipment---namely aircraft---since at least 2015 and was 23.6% below
the final year of the Obama administration. The new year has also opened
slowly with just \$9.2 billion of orders in the first three months of
the year from \$14.5 billion at the same time in 2018. Given President
Trump's prior focus on promoting the defense industry, there may be
pressure to approve the orders and send them to Congress. Worth notin[g,
Taiwan was the third-largest buyer of U.S. military systems, including
vehicles and weapons, in 2018 and the ninth-largest buyer of aerospace
equipment including jets and helicopters, according to
Panjiva.]{.underline} Combined exports reached \$436 million in 2018, up
18.5% year over year with aerospace accounted for 82.9%. For context,
the tank order, which was first tried by Taiwan back in July 2018, would
be worth \$990 million, according to Jane's Defense[. Even though China
has seen U.S. weapons imported into Taiwan before, this size of the
order and its timing could be a huge deal breaker for Trump. China was
ranked as the biggest security threat to the U.S.]{.underline} based on
January's World Threat Assessment published by the U.S. intelligence
agencies[. Trade wars are just part of the escalating crisis between the
two sides]{.underline}, with the South China Sea being the newest
military flashpoint[. Taiwan was always a sleeping giant threatening to
rattle China-U.S. relations, but sales]{.underline} of F-16s [put an
unwelcome spotlight on Taiwan. Last Thursday, China's defense
ministry]{.underline} spokesperson Wu Qian [said China "resolutely
opposes" any weaponry sales to Taiwan, adding that any words or actions
that undermine the one-China policy are "extremely
dangerous,"]{.underline} Quartz magazine reported[. Foreign ministry
spokesperson Geng Shuang also reiterated Beijing's insistence on
peaceful ties between Taiwan, the U.S. and China. "We urge the U.S. to
fully realize the high degree of sensitivity and severe impact of this
issue, honor its commitment to the one-China principle, and ... stop
arms sales to Taiwan."]{.underline} China's Air Forced buzzed Taiwan on
Sunday by allegedly flying across a no-fly zone for Beijing military in
the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan scrambled fighter planes on Sunday morning to
chase away two Chinese made J-11 Flanker B+ fighter jets. Tsai and Xi
are not on speaking terms. She has refused to accept China's goal to
eventually absorb Taiwan, and the latest call for U.S. war planes now
puts Trump in the middle. Any sale before a trade deal would be a huge
stumbling block for Xi within the Communist Party back home, and [any
sale to Taiwan after a trade deal would be seen as a breach of trust by
Xi.]{.underline} If Washington is looking for "enforceable" trade
action, they are unlikely to get it if Beijing doesn't get an
enforceable agreement on Taiwan.

### 2AC\-\--AT: Cease Fire

#### The cease-fire doesn't solve the relationship

**Wiseman and Chan 6-29** (Paul Wiseman and Kelvin Chan - journalists
for the Associated Press. July 29, 2019, \"Cease-fire in US-China trade
war doesn\'t bridge differences,\" AP NEWS,
<https://www.apnews.com/5611d33f259c41808bab230accf8b3fb>) \<TMS\>

WASHINGTON (AP) --- Once again, Presidents Donald [Trump and Xi Jinping
have hit the reset button in trade talks]{.underline} between the
world's two biggest economies, [at least delaying an escalation in
tension]{.underline} between the U.S. and China that had financial
markets on edge and cast a cloud over the global economy. [But when U.S.
and Chinese negotiators sit down to work out details, the same difficult
task remains: getting China to convince the United States that it will
curb its aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance
--- and then to live up to its promises]{.underline}. At the Group of 20
meeting in Osaka, Japan, Trump and Xi agreed to a cease-fire in the
trade conflict . Trump said Saturday he would hold off for the "time
being" on plans to impose tariffs on \$300 billion more in Chinese
imports --- on top of the \$250 billion he's already targeted. This
decision will jump-start trade talks that stalled last month. "We're
going to work with China where we left off," Trump said Saturday. He
also said China had agreed to buy more American farm products. Andy
Rothman, an investment strategist with Matthews Asia and a former
economic official with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said the Trump-Xi
meeting was more conciliatory than he expected. He [was struck by
Trump's use of the term "strategic partner" to describe U.S. relations
with China]{.underline} after other administration officials have played
up the geopolitical rivalry between the two countries. Addressing
another contentious issue, Trump said he will now allow U.S. companies
to sell some components to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei,
which last month was put on an American blacklist as a threat to
national security. Trump said that Huawei will stay on the blacklist,
however, and that its future won't be decided until the end of the trade
talks. Neil Shearing, London-based chief economist at Capital Economics,
predicted that financial markets will rally with relief when they reopen
Monday. "[But I don't think this marks the turning of the]{.underline}
tide," he said. "**[Talks will ebb and flow, but the direction over the
next 12 months will be toward renewed escalation because issues around
industrial strategy will prove to be so intractable]{.underline}**." The
Trump administration says China is trying to cheat its way to dominance
in the cutting-edge technologies of the future such as artificial
intelligence and quantum computing. In a report last year, the Office of
the United States Trade Representative accused Beijing of resorting to
predatory tactics to challenge American technological supremacy. These
include forcing foreign companies to hand over technology in exchange
for access to the Chinese market; subsidizing its own companies
(especially those owned by the state) while burying foreign firms in
regulations; providing government money so Chinese firms can buy
sensitive foreign technology at above-market prices; and stealing trade
secrets outright. Eleven rounds of talks failed to end the standoff. The
United States has imposed 25% import taxes on \$250 billion in Chinese
products and threatened to target \$300 billion more --- a move that
would extend the tariffs to virtually everything China ships to the
United States. China has lashed back with tariffs on \$110 billion in
American goods, focusing on agricultural products in a direct and
painful shot at Trump supporters in the U.S. farm belt. **[The last time
Trump and Xi met]{.underline}** --- in early December at a G-20
gathering in Buenos Aires, Argentina --- [they also reached a cease-fire
that injected new life into the talks. But **the momentum didn't
last**.]{.underline} [Until May, it appeared that the two countries were
slowly closing in on a deal. But then U.S. officials accused their
Chinese counterparts of reneging on commitments they'd made earlier, and
talks broke down.]{.underline} Getting them back on track could prove
difficult. Beijing is reluctant to end subsidies to Chinese companies
and to write any commitments into Chinese law. The Chinese also want the
United States to drop its tariffs as a condition of any deal. But the
Trump administration insists on keeping tariffs to use as leverage to
make sure that China keeps its promises. For now, business groups are
relieved that the tariffs aren't expanding and optimistic the two
countries can reach a deal. "We are encouraged that China and the United
States have agreed to continue negotiations without further escalation
of the mutually damaging trade war," said Jason Oxman, president of the
Information Technology Industry Council. "We are also relieved that
President Trump has reconsidered his threat to impose additional
tariffs, which would have accelerated harm to all American consumers,
workers, and businesses of all sizes." Still, the decision to go easy on
Huawei drew immediate fire politically. "Huawei is one of few potent
levers we have to make China play fair on trade," said Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "If President Trump backs off, as it
appears he is doing, it will dramatically undercut our ability to change
China's unfair trades practices." The Commerce Department put the firm
on a blacklist because of the possibility its equipment could be used
for cyberespionage. Trump suggested that his administration will review
the company's status on Commerce's so-called Entity List and cleared the
way for U.S. firms to sell it some components. Both countries have
economic and political incentives to reach a deal. Xi is overseeing a
decelerating economy and likely won't want to be engaged in a
destructive trade war when China's ruling Communist Party meets in
October. Trump, too, is confronted with an economy that, though still
healthy, has looked a bit wobbly. And the trade hostilities with China
have hurt his supporters in rural America as he campaigns for
re-election in 2020. "[This is a truce for now]{.underline} - for Xi,
ahead of the Communist Party celebrations in October and for Trump,
dependent on how his re-election campaign progresses," said Diana
Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics. "[But as we've said
before, **fundamentally, this dispute is** about much more than trade -
it's **part of a longer-term Great Decoupling that stems from a conflict
over technological supremacy and geopolitical power.** This is about
redefining the world political and economic order, a process that will
see periods of relative calm and also periods of significant
turbulence]{.underline}." "[Both Chinese and U.S. leaders recognize the
importance of bringing the relations back to the right
track,]{.underline}" said Li Yong of the China Association of
International Trade. "President Xi said we hoped to see normal
relations. [It's hard to predict what will happen tomorrow, so I cannot
say when the relations will return to right track.]{.underline}"

[A top Chinese general has a warning for any U.S. leaders planning an
arms race in space: Be prepared to lose.]{.underline} Outspending a
rival power into economic exhaustion might have helped the U.S. win the
Cold War, said Qiao Liang, a major general in the Chinese air force who
co-wrote a book called \"Unrestricted Warfare: China's Master Plan to
Destroy America.\" But he said it won't work against a wealthy
manufacturing powerhouse like China. "China is not the Soviet Union,"
Qiao said in an interview with the South China Morning Post, a news
partner of POLITICO. "If the United States thinks it can also drag China
into an arms race and take down China as it did with the Soviets ... in
the end, probably it would not be China who is down on the ground."
Qiao's words come as both [Washington and Beijing are pouring money and
resources into an increasingly militarized space race that some security
specialists and former U.S. officials fear is heightening the risk of
war. The aggressive maneuvers include President Donald Trump's proposal
for a standalone Space Force]{.underline} --- which Qiao dismisses as
"an unwise move" --- [and efforts by both countries to develop laser and
cyber weapons that could take out each other\'s satellites]{.underline}.
The rivalry is plainly on the minds of leaders at the Pentagon, which
cites \"space\" 86 times in a new threat assessment of China\'s
military. It also warns that the People\'s Liberation Army is working on
\"enabling long-range precision strikes\" and developing directed-energy
weapons for use in orbit. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a slew of
[U.S. military leaders have cited China\'s military space programs as a
key rationale for proposing the Space Force,]{.underline} which would
gather nearly all the Defense Department's space-related programs into a
new military branch --- similar to one China created four years ago.
Congress is considering the administration's plan, although some defense
hawks are skeptical. Pence has also expressed alarm at China's success
in landing un-crewed probes on the moon, a place U.S. astronauts last
visited in 1972. "Last December, China became the first nation to land
on the far side of the moon and revealed their ambition to seize the
lunar strategic high ground and become the world's preeminent
spacefaring nation," Pence said at a meeting of the National Space
Council in March. [Even more worrying, neither country seems interested
in placing the issue on the diplomatic agenda to lower the
tensions]{.underline}, some security advocates say. That's in contrast
to the decades of space cooperation that have existed between the U.S.
and Russia. \"[One of my biggest concerns is that for all the talk about
how horrible an armed conflict with China would be for everyone, all the
current U.S. policies and actions seem to be preparing for armed
conflict instead of avoiding it," said Brian Weeden, the director of
program planning at the Secure World Foundation, which advocates for
using space in a peaceful and sustainable way.]{.underline} ["There is
not a lot of dialogue between the U.S. and China]{.underline},\" Weeden
said. But other space experts say [China is a greater threat to the
United States than most people realize --- and even an "imminent
threat]{.underline}," independent analyst Namrata Goswami said. "[If
anything, \[the threat from China\] is under-appreciated and underplayed
in the U.S.," she said. "I suspect that is because the U.S. military
might not want to call attention to its own vulnerabilities regarding
its space assets]{.underline}." [Qiao said China is not seeking a space
war. But he said it is preparing to counter any nation, including the
U.S., that seeks to pose a threat to China\'s national
security]{.underline}. Qiao said China's economic prowess leaves it well
positioned to prevail in an expensive contest with the U.S. \"When the
United States and the Soviet Union engaged in the Cold War and the arms
race, the United States was the largest manufacturing country, and the
Soviet Union was not even the second," he said. \"But today it is China
who is the world\'s top manufacturer.\" Recent reports from U.S. spy
agencies and think tanks indicate that China\'s efforts are advancing
quickly. [Those include estimates that China will soon be able to field
high-powered lasers designed to attack objects in low-Earth orbit ---
and evidence that Chinese weapons can already attack targets much
farther from the Earth than the United States can. China's reliance on
space assets is also expanding]{.underline}: It has more than 120
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites of its own ---
a number second only to the United States. About half of those assets
owned and operated by the Chinese military and could be used to track
and target U.S. forces around the world, the report warns. [The threat
getting the most attention is the danger China's orbiting weapons might
pose to the satellites the United States relies on for communications,
navigation and surveillance --- for both military operations and
economic well-being. China is heavily investing in so-called
counterspace technology, including the development of at least three
antisatellite missile systems]{.underline}, according to an April report
from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It is also
developing satellites that touch other satellites in orbit, the report
said. While that technology can be used for repairs in orbit, it can
also be used to disable a satellite or tear off a solar array to affect
a satellite's power source. [The Pentagon's China Military Power report
found that China is also pursuing new jamming and "directed energy"
weapons that can interfere with satellites. In a conflict, that
technology would probably be used to "blind and deafen the
enemy]{.underline}," the report said. China also reorganized the
People's Liberation Army in 2015 to create a Strategic Support Force, a
military branch dedicated entirely to space, electronic and cyber
warfare. The new branch was designed to bring space assets from across
the Chinese military under one organization, similar to the goal of the
U.S. Space Force. The space-centric branch, which reports directly to
the Central Military Commission, is focused primarily on satellite
launches and intelligence, navigation and communication operations, but
also conducts research and development on new counterspace capabilities,
according to a Defense Intelligence agency report published in February.
C[hinese military units are also training with missiles that could
damage or destroy satellites]{.underline}, the Defense Intelligence
Agency reported in February. [And they will probably have a ground-based
laser that can blind optical sensors on satellites in low-Earth orbit by
2020]{.underline}. [Unlike the United States or Russia, China is also
believed to have the capacity to use missiles to attack
satellites]{.underline} in the more distant geosynchronous orbit, or
[22,000 miles above Earth.]{.underline} If any country were to launch a
kinetic strike in geosynchronous orbit, the debris field would make the
area, which is today used for critical missions like early missile
warning and weather observations, unusable. "We have much more to lose
in GEO than any other country," said Kaitlyn Johnson, an associate
fellow who specializes in space security at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "We wouldn't want to have a first strike
capability." [Military experts also worry that China could try to seize
areas of the moon that contain strategic resources including ice that
could be used for rocket fuel or life support. But they say it's much
more likely China would want to use dominance in space to influence
conflicts on Earth. Being able to threaten the military's GPS or
communications satellites might deter the U.S. from getting involved in
a conflict **in the South China Sea**]{.underline}, Weeden said. The
U.S. Space Force is intended to close some of those gaps by grouping
space troops together to build expertise and giving the new service
autonomy over its budget requests. One of the biggest goals of the new
branch is to speed up space acquisition, allowing new technology to be
fielded faster, and to develop a space "doctrine" that would oversee how
the U.S. fights conflicts when space platforms are at stake.

Opportunity to Use the Space Domain to Strengthen the U.S.-China
Relationship" *The National Bureau of Asian Research*
http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=602

The [U.S.-China relationship in space has the potential to be a stable
foundation for a stronger overall relationship between the two
countries.]{.underline} Space was arguably a stabilizing element in the
relationship between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold
War by providing national capabilities to reduce tensions and an outlet
for collaboration. Although the future of the U.S.-China relationship
will be characterized by both competition and cooperation, [taking
concrete steps to stabilize relations in space can be part of the
solution to avoiding the "Thucydides trap," where an established power's
fear of a rising power leads to conflict.]{.underline} Space is a
critical domain to the security of the United States. Space capabilities
enable secure, hardened communications with nuclear forces, enable the
verification and monitoring of arms control treaties, and provide
valuable intelligence. Such capabilities are the foundation of the
United States' ability to defend its borders, project power to protect
its allies and interests overseas, and defeat adversaries. The space
domain, however, is currently experiencing significant changes that
could affect the United States' ability to maintain all these benefits
in the future. A growing number of state and nonstate actors are
involved in space, resulting in more than 1,200 active satellites in
orbit and thousands more planned in the near future. Active satellites
coexist in space along with hundreds of thousands of dead satellites,
spent rocket stages, and other pieces of debris that are a legacy of six
decades of space activities. As a result, the most useful and densely
populated orbits are experiencing significant increases in physical and
electromagnetic congestion and interference. Amid this change, China is
rapidly developing its capabilities across the entire spectrum of space
activities. It has a robust and successful human spaceflight and
exploration program that in many ways mirrors NASA's successes in the
1960s and 1970s and is a similar source of national pride. Although it
still has a long way to go, China is developing a range of space
capabilities focused on national security that one day might be second
only to those of the United States. Some of China's new capabilities
have created significant concern within the U.S. national security
community, as they are aimed at countering or threatening the space
capabilities of the United States and other countries. The massive
changes in the space domain and China's growing capabilities have
affected the U.S.-China relationship in space. There is growing mistrust
between the two countries, fueled in part by their development and
testing of dual-use technologies such as rendezvous and proximity
operations and hypervelocity kinetic kill systems. This mistrust is
compounded by a misalignment in political and strategic priorities:
China is focused on developing and increasing its capabilities in the
space domain, whereas the United States is focused on maintaining and
assuring access to its space capabilities. Despite these challenges and
concerns, there are concrete steps that the United States and China can
take to manage tensions and possibly even work toward positive
engagement. In 2011, President Barack Obama and then Chinese president
Hu Jintao issued a joint statement on strengthening U.S.-China relations
during a visit by President Hu to the White House. As one of the steps
outlined in the statement, the two presidents agreed to take specific
actions to deepen dialogue and exchanges in the field of space and
discuss opportunities for practical future cooperation. President Xi
Jinping's upcoming visit presents an opportunity to build on the 2011
agreement and take steps toward these goals. The first step should be to
have a substantive discussion on space security. President Obama should
clearly communicate the importance that the United States places on
assured access to space, U.S. concerns with recent Chinese counterspace
testing, and the potential negative consequences of any aggressive acts
in space. [Both countries should exchange views on space policies,
including their interpretations of how self-defense applies to
satellites and hostile actions in space. Doing so can help avoid
misunderstandings and misperceptions that could lead either country to
unwittingly take actions that escalate a crisis.]{.underline} Second,
Presidents Obama and Xi should discuss specific ideas for cooperation in
civil and scientific space activities and the use of space for peaceful
applications on earth. Continuing to exclude China from civil space
cooperation will not prevent it from developing its own capabilities;
this approach will only ensure that China cooperates with other
countries in space in a way that advances its own national interests and
goals. [Space weather, scientific research, exploration, capacity
building for disaster response, and global environmental monitoring are
all areas where the United States and China share joint interests and
could collaborate with each other and other interested countries to help
establish broader relationships outside the military realm.]{.underline}
In addition, the United States should take steps on its own to stabilize
the relationship. First and foremost, it should get serious about making
U.S. space capabilities more resilient. Increasing resilience would
support deterrence by decreasing the benefits an adversary might hope to
achieve and also help ensure that critical capabilities can survive
should deterrence fail. While resilience has been a talking point for
the last few years, the United States has made little progress toward
achieving the goal. Radical change is thus needed in how Washington
develops and organizes national security space capabilities. Moreover,
the United States should embrace commercial services to diversify and
augment governmental capabilities, while encouraging allies to develop
their own space capabilities. Second, the United States should continue
to bolster the transparency of space activities by increasing the amount
of space situational awareness (SSA) data available to satellite
operators and the public. Greater transparency reinforces ongoing U.S.
and international initiatives to promote responsible behavior in space
and also helps mitigate the possibility for accidents or naturally
caused events to spark or escalate tensions. Shifting responsibility for
space safety to a civil agency that can share and cooperate more easily
with the international community and working with the international
community to develop more publicly available sources of SSA data outside
the U.S. government are two steps that would enhance trust, improve data
reliability, and reinforce norms of behavior. The consequences of not
addressing the current strategic instability in space are real. [A
future conflict in space between the United States and China would have
devastating impacts on everyone who uses and relies on space. Both the
United States and China have acknowledged the dangers of outright
conflict and have pledged their interest in avoiding such an outcome.
Taken together, the initial steps outlined here could help stabilize the
U.S.-China strategic relationship in space, mitigate the threat of the
worst-case scenario, and work toward a more positive outcome that
benefits all.]{.underline}

#### Space militarization makes global WMD conflict inevitable

Pittsburgh, Et al., ISIS Briefing on Ballistic Missile Defense, July,

A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of \'peace
through strength\' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the
tendency that \'[... the presence of space weapons...will result in the
increased likelihood of their
use\']{.underline}.[33](http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6_paper.html#note1#note1)
This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated
by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, \'anti-ballistic
missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go
hand-in-hand\'.[34](http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6_paper.html#note1#note1)
The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space
technology stems from the inherent \'dual capability\' of spaceborne
weapon components. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN
Conference on Disarmament, explains: \'If you want to intercept
something in space, you could use the same capability to target
something on land\'.
[35](http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6_paper.html#note1#note1)
To the extent that [ballistic missile interceptors]{.underline} based in
space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors
[can]{.underline} also [be used as **orbiting \'Death
Stars\'**]{.underline}, capable of sending munitions hurtling through
the Earth\'s atmosphere. The [dizzying speed]{.underline} of space
warfare [would introduce]{.underline} intense [\'use or lose\'
pressure]{.underline} into strategic calculations, with the spectre of
split-second attacks [creating incentives to rig]{.underline} orbiting
[Death Stars with automated \'hair trigger\' devices]{.underline}. In
theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space
weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out
of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war,
[military planners could sow]{.underline} insidious [seeds of
**accidental conflict**]{.underline}. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow
has analyzed \'complexly interactive, tightly coupled\' industrial
systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components
that all depend on each other\'s flawless performance. According to
Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all
the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains,
\'\[t\]he odd term \"normal accident\" is meant to signal that, given
the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of
failures are
inevitable\'.[36](http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6_paper.html#note1#note1)
[Deployment]{.underline} of space weapons [with pre-delegated
authority]{.underline} to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles
[would **likely make war itself inevitable**]{.underline}, given the
susceptibility of such systems to \'normal accidents\'. It is chilling
to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired
Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, [\'even a tiny projectile]{.underline}
reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it
[can do enormous damage --- **even more than**]{.underline} would be
done by **[a nuclear weapon]{.underline}** of the same size!\'.
[37](http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6_paper.html#note1#note1)
In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of
peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing
offensive weapons ever conceived: \'One imagines dead cities of
microwave-grilled
people\'.[38](http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6_paper.html#note1#note1)
Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine
that [any nation]{.underline} subjected to space weapon attack [would
retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological,
and]{.underline}/or [chemical weapons. An accidental war]{.underline}
sparked by a computer glitch in space [could **plunge the world into the
most destructive military conflict ever seen**]{.underline}.

\<TMS\>)

Chinese President [Xi Jinping]{.underline} paid a high-profile visit
last month to air force headquarters in Beijing, where he [ordered his
generals to sharpen the country\'s defensive and offensive capabilities
in space in preparation for what many Chinese military analysts believe
is an inevitable war in space with the U.S.]{.underline} Like the U.S.
and Russia, China has sent astronauts into space and landed a spacecraft
on the moon, and it is developing its own space station. [The Pentagon
also notes that Beijing continues to ramp up its military capabilities
in space]{.underline}, launching 142 satellites to provide intelligence,
navigation, communications and weather forecasting that can \"limit or
prevent the use of space-based assets by adversaries during times of
crisis or conflict.\" [A war in space would have staggering
implications. If conflict were to erupt]{.underline}, say, [over
China\'s territorial claims to the South China Sea]{.underline} or
Russia\'s aggression in Eastern Europe[, America\'s military satellites
wouldn\'t be the only space assets at risk. Fighting would also likely
cripple the civilian satellites that control so much of modern
life]{.underline}, from cellphone networks to ATMs and personal GPS
units. [And although such a conflict might start in space, experts say
it could easily turn into full-scale war on Earth]{.underline}. \"If war
does extend into space someday---and I hope it never does---[the first
\[nuclear\] response is not going to be in space]{.underline},\" warns
General John Hyten, head of the U.S. Air Force Space Command.This year,
the Pentagon will spend \$2 billion on measures to counter threats to
its national security satellites. That amount is expected to soar as
part of the \$22 billion set aside to maintain U.S. superiority in space
in 2017. Senior U.S. officials explain such large investments reflect
the Pentagon\'s recognition of a major shift in U.S., Chinese and
Russian capabilities. For the first 25 years after the Cold War\'s end,
they note, America\'s conventional forces were unmatched, thanks largely
to the advantages their satellites gave them on the battlefield. Making
their debut in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, satellites have guided
American precision munitions, provided U.S. commanders with worldwide
communications and helped American forces navigate the globe ever
since.But over the past 15 years, a period in which U.S. defense dollars
were diverted to pay for the wars in the Middle East,
[China]{.underline} and Russia have [developed advanced weapons that
\"challenge our advantages\...especially in cyber, electronic warfare
and space]{.underline},\" says Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work.
\"As a result, our margin of technological superiority is slowly
eroding.\" Today, [Beijing]{.underline} and Moscow [can no longer be
ignored]{.underline}. With their ability to deny, disrupt and degrade
America\'s hard-to-defend satellites, warns Lieutenant General David
Buck, commander of the 14th Air Force, \"[there isn\'t a single aspect
of our space architecture that isn\'t at risk]{.underline}.\"

### 2AC\-\-- Warming Add-On

#### Despite tensions potential for climate partnership is possible

**Rubin 1-2** (Robert E. Rubin - secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to
1999 and is co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.
January 2, 2019, \"Opinion,\" NYT,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/opinion/america-china-climate-change-nuclear-weapons.html>)

[In the United States, support for a cooperative relationship with China
is evaporating fast]{.underline}. I increasingly hear frustration from
business leaders about structural trade issues. [The military is
concerned about aggressive geopolitical moves by Beijing]{.underline}.
And [prominent voices in both political parties are striking an
increasingly confrontational tone. Legitimate concerns have led to a
vicious cycle, with each negative development further poisoning an
already shallow well of good will. The cycle has to be
reversed]{.underline}. In the United States, the business community,
policy analysts and the media should create a climate that encourages
elected officials to pursue a constructive relationship. The same is
true in China, albeit in a different political system. [Leaders in both
countries should recognize our imperative self-interest in working
together on]{.underline} hugely consequential [transnational issues,
especially]{.underline} two threats to life on earth as we know it:
nuclear weapons and [climate change]{.underline}. [No single country can
tackle these threats alone, and existing international institutions have
proved inadequate. The best chance for successfully dealing with these
overarching issues]{.underline} --- as well as other transnational
issues like pandemics, terrorism and cybersecurity --- [is for the
world's two largest national economies to catalyze global
action.]{.underline} In a conversation I recently led at the Council on
Foreign Relations, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, alluded to
this, remarking that "[history will remember those who took the lead in
the mist]{.underline}." [The surest way for that to happen is to forge a
constructive relationship between our two countries. Absent that, it is
imperative that we put our differences aside to tackle]{.underline}
these two [existential challenges.]{.underline} [As the two largest
economies, the United States and China can set the tone for a global
effort against climate change by investing in clean-energy technology,
adopting strict environmental rules and encouraging their trading
partners to do the same]{.underline}. (Of course, the current
administration does not accept the reality of climate change, but future
administrations will hopefully recognize the urgency of action.)
Cooperation is also needed to address the spread or possible use of
nuclear weapons. North Korea's continued development of fissile
materials and missiles is an apparent contravention of its recent
agreement with the United States. And North Korea isn't the only
concern. Pakistan, for example, has a weak government and uncertain
controls over its nuclear arsenal. The arc of human history is one of
frequent conflict. Unless you believe human nature is likely to change,
that suggests a serious risk that nuclear arms will be used at some
point by state or nonstate actors. United States-China cooperation to
limit nuclear proliferation among states, the diversion of nuclear
material to terrorists and other risks would make us all safer. [The
most promising prospect for tackling these challenges is to put our
countries' economic relationship back on steady footing]{.underline}.
The tenor of the relationship gets set at the top, so it's time for
Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping to work out their current trade disputes
within a framework that prioritizes cooperation. [The administration's
antipathy toward China sometimes seems driven by an irrational anger
over trade deficits. Virtually all mainstream economists see the
president's theory that our trade relationship should be evaluated by
the bilateral trade deficit as analytically wrong.]{.underline} On the
other hand, China has contravened some widely accepted trade and
investment norms by, for example, subsidizing exports, restricting
imports, protecting national champions, imposing buy-China mandates and,
at times, requiring foreign companies to share their intellectual
property with Chinese partners. These structural policies present a
complex problem. They're embedded in China's economic model, and the
United States needs to recognize that it can't simply demand that China
change that model. And China needs to recognize that its system creates
some unacceptable consequences in the trade arena. From there, [the two
countries should be able to identify reasonable solutions. Washington's
approach should have been multilateral and quiet, joining with other
countries, including our European allies, Brazil, Mexico and Japan to
approach Beijing as a united bloc]{.underline}; hopefully it's not too
late to walk this path. [We've bridged our economic and political
differences before]{.underline}. When I served as Treasury secretary in
the 1990s, the United States and China worked together to stem the Asian
financial crisis. And though the current administration has withdrawn
from the Paris climate agreement, bilateral cooperation was integral to
its creation in 2015. [We must look beyond the daily headlines about
trade to the more consequential problem of ever-greater friction between
the United States and China. For the future of humanity, not to mention
our immediate economic interests, our two countries must recognize our
mutual self-interest in a constructive relationship and act
accordingly.]{.underline}

#### Coop spurs international follow on

**Makinen and Megerian 15** (Julie Makinen, Chris Megerian, 12-13-2015,
\"[China, U.S. relationship key in climate agreement]{.underline},\"
latimes,
<https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-u-s-climate-20151213-story.html>)

Even as smog levels in Beijing often turn the sky a smoky gray, one
thing was clear at the global climate change talks in Paris:
[China]{.underline}, once a laggard, [emerged as a key player in the
battle to help avert the worst effects of global warming. The shift, by
the world\'s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, helped pave the way
for the commitment by nearly 200 nations to reduce
emissions]{.underline}. \"You had a developing country and somebody who
had been leading the efforts against us,\" said Secretary of State John
F. Kerry, \"that opened the door.\" After the December 2009 Copenhagen
climate talks descended into chaos, some of the sharpest finger-pointing
had been directed at China. Beijing didn\'t send Premier Wen Jiabao to
the final discussions that time, leaving leaders including President
Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to negotiate with an official
who frequently left the room to phone his superiors. The Chinese pushed
to remove specific targets on emissions cuts --- even those that would
apply only to advanced industrialized countries and not itself. \"China
wrecked the talks ... and insisted on an awful \'deal\' so Western
leaders would walk away carrying the blame,\" British environmental
author Mark Lynas, who was with one of the national delegations, wrote
in a fly-on-the-wall account. What a difference six years makes: Obama
and Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared side by side at the start of
this year\'s Paris climate change talks. And on Saturday, as global
leaders congratulated themselves on reaching an agreement, the U.S. was
singling out China for praise for its constructive engagement. Asked
after the vote to cite the most important steps along the way that
enabled the deal, Kerry immediately pointed to [China\'s willingness to
\"build a working partnership\" with Washington and jointly announce
national emissions-reduction targets in advance.]{.underline} What
explains China\'s shift? It\'s not necessarily pangs of guilt nor a
newfound sense of global munificence. Instead, after years of
downplaying its environmental crisis, [Chinese leaders appear to have
recognized that cleaning up China\'s toxic skies and pushing the country
toward renewable energy are crucial to maintaining the Communist
Party\'s grip on power amid rising public discontent.]{.underline} Now,
[instead of regarding any multilateral environmental pact as a hindrance
to unbridled economic growth, China sees an opportunity to seize
agreements such as the Paris deal to showcase itself as a progressive
superpower and responsible international stakeholder]{.underline} ---
while doing things it needs to do at home anyway. The Obama
administration, said Kerry, recognized this coming convergence in 2013
and sought to capitalize on it \"to change the paradigm of what happened
in Copenhagen.\" \"We saw they had environmental challenges in China and
had \[a self-\] interest, therefore, and we tried to tap into that.\"
The alignment between China\'s domestic agenda and its willingness to
step up in Paris was brought into sharp relief last week as air
pollution levels skyrocketed in Beijing. For the first time, city
officials issued a \"red alert,\" closing schools, shutting down work at
construction sites and ordering millions of cars off the capital\'s
roads. Since Xi came to power about three years ago, [Chinese leaders
have shown increasing political will to impose extraordinary measures to
clean the skies, even if it means curtailing economic
activity.]{.underline} To be sure, the steps have been uneven and at
times downright vain --- [China has been most willing to shutter
factories and curb coal burning]{.underline} when it\'s hosting
high-profile international gatherings in Beijing such as the 2014
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, September\'s military parade,
and international sporting events. Although the immediate goal is to
protect public health, not halt global warming, the strictures generally
target the same carbon-generators that cause global warming. At the same
time, [Chinese authorities are pushing the development of solar, wind,
hydropower and nuclear power --- and to make China\'s alternative energy
sector a global economic force. China has become the world\'s biggest
investor in renewable energy]{.underline} and plans to launch a
nationwide carbon emissions trading market in 2017. These changes come
as China increasingly acknowledges the human and financial toll of
pollution. A 2014 joint study by the World Bank and China\'s government
estimated that air pollution alone may cost the nation up to \$300
billion a year. Another report led by economists and former foreign
heads of state noted that smog is blamed for more than a million
premature deaths annually in China, and said those deaths may cost the
nation up to 13% of its GDP. Sam Geall, a University of Sussex research
fellow, said in a recent report that diplomacy certainly has helped push
China along. \"[But far more important is the growing awareness that
climate impacts and air pollution pose major threats to \[China\'s\]
development,]{.underline}\" he said. \"In short, [China\'s new approach
rests on the fact that its leaders see combating climate change as being
in the national interest]{.underline},\" he added. \"And underpinning
that perception is not only a vision of how China might position itself
in \[the\] future, but also a real transformation already underway in
China\'s economy.\" On the U.S. side, Obama has also become
progressively bold, even as Congress shows resistance, said Eric Pooley,
senior vice president for strategy and communications at the
Environmental Defense Fund. With executive branch initiatives such as
the EPA\'s Clean Power Plan --- which takes effect this month and is
designed to cut carbon emissions from power plants --- Obama has been
looking to make his environmental policies a centerpiece of his legacy.
That momentum is a contrast from 2009, when the president\'s eco-agenda
had just suffered a defeat as the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill
failed in Congress, weakening his hand on the world stage. Six years
ago, \"both of the biggest nations in the world were not ready to
deal,\" Pooley said. Now, \"the dynamic between the U.S. and China has
totally changed\.... They used to blame each other for inaction. Now
they\'re encouraging each other toward more ambitious action.\" In some
ways, [Washington and Beijing have been driven to find common ground on
global warming]{.underline} because they have failed to see eye to eye
on so many other issues, including trade and cyberattacks, as well as
human rights and the South China Sea. \"China and the United States need
an area where they can cooperate,\" said Nathaniel Keohane, a former
Obama White House staffer and now vice president for global climate at
the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Climate change is becoming that
area.\" Momentum soared in November 2014 when Obama attended the APEC
summit in Beijing and announced with Xi that the countries would both
pursue policies to cut carbon emissions. [Obama pledged the U.S. would
emit at least 26% less carbon in 2025 than it did in 2005. Xi vowed his
country would \"peak\" its carbon emissions by 2030, if not sooner, and
said solar, wind and other clean energy technology would account for 20%
of China\'s total power production by that year. Their bilateral
agreement \"sent a powerful signal to the rest of the
world,\"]{.underline} said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned
Scientists, a veteran of climate negotiations. \"[If the world\'s two
biggest emitters aren\'t serious about dealing with the problem, you
can\'t deal with the problem]{.underline}.\" Seeing them work together,
he added, \"gave people a sense of hope.\" When Xi visited Washington in
September, the two leaders followed up with a 17-point joint statement
looking ahead to the Paris talks. During negotiations in France over the
last two weeks, U.S. officials were in \"very, very regular contact with
the Chinese,\" said one administration source, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Though the two countries have real differences,
administration officials said they believed they had mutual candor with
the Chinese. On Friday, as the Paris negotiators raced to hammer out the
final language of their text, Xi and Obama once again spoke by phone.
The pact adopted Saturday for the first time commits virtually every
nation to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate
change, and setting progressively more stringent goals every five years.
[Though each country will determine its own goals, nations will be
required to submit to outside monitoring of their progress, and
developed nations pledged to help fund new, clean energy sources for
developing countries.]{.underline} \"[With our historic joint
announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge
the old divide between developed and developing nations that had stymied
global progress for so long]{.underline},\" Obama said Saturday. \"[That
accomplishment ... was the foundation for success in
Paris.\"]{.underline}

#### Extinction

**Bijma et al, 13** (Jelle, Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and
Marine Research, Bremerhaven Germany, Hans-O Portner, Chris Yesson, Alex
D. Rogers, "Climate change and the oceans -- What does the future hold?"
Marine Pollution Bulletin,
<http://www.stateoftheocean.org/pdfs/Bijma-et-al-2013.pdf>)

As documented by a ﬂood of recent literature, [most, if not all, of the
Earth's ﬁve global mass extinction events have left
footprints]{.underline} (Table 1), [of at least one or more, of the main
symptoms of global carbon perturbations: global warming, ocean
acidiﬁcation and hypoxia]{.underline} (e.g. Pörtner et al., 2005; Knoll
et al., 2007; Veron, 2008; Metcalfe and Isozaki, 2009; Ridgwell and
Schmidt, 2010; Barnosky et al., 2011; Georgiev et al., 2011; Suan et
al., 2011; Payne et al., 2010; Zamagni et al., 2012a,b; Kravchinsky,
2012; Winguth et al., 2012; Alegret et al., 2012; Harnik et al., 2013;
Hönisch et al., 2012). Although, it can be argued whether or not the
end-Ordovician or the end-Cretaceous event were driven by ''big
threeism'', it can be said that the end-Permian and end-Triassic almost
certainly, and the end-Devonian very likely (e.g. Bambach et al., 2004),
as well as a handful of smaller [extinction events, are related to a
carbon perurbation.]{.underline} Hence, [we can call these three factors
a 'deadly trio', and worryingly these are all present in the ocean
today.]{.underline} In fact, [the present day carbon perturbation and
the concurrent ocean acidiﬁcation is unprecedented in the Earth's
history and occurring much faster than at any time in the past 55
million years]{.underline} (Kump et al., 2009) or even 300 million years
(Hönisch et al., 2012; Fig. 5). It [is this combination of factors that
seriously affects how productive and efﬁcient the ocean is]{.underline}
(Fig. 1), [as ocean temperature, surface stratiﬁcation, nutrient supply,
ocean overturning and deep ocean oxygen supply are all
affected.]{.underline} Even though some species are shown to proliferate
in a warmer and more acidic ocean, [the process of extinction may have
already begun]{.underline}. [Projecting geological time scales onto
human lifespan, mass extinctions happen overnight, but on human time
scales we may not even realize whether we have entered such an
event,]{.underline} even when keeping close track of the ''red list
index'' of species extinctions (Barnosky et al., 2011). It is known,
with a high level of conﬁdence [from geological evidence]{.underline},
that [ocean acidiﬁcation occurred in the past]{.underline}. [The most
critical factor is the rate of the carbon perturbation]{.underline}.
During [the End Permian mass extinction]{.underline} (ca. 251 million
years ago), the carbon perturbation is estimated to be on the order of
1--2 Gt CO2 per year (Kump et al., 2009). For comparison, 1 gigaton is
one billion tons, or the equivalent of around one billion middle-sized
cars. For the most recent major extinction event -- [the Paleocene
Eocene Thermal Maximum extinction]{.underline} (PETM; ca. 55 million
years ago is considered the closest analogue to currently ongoing ocean
acidiﬁcation), estimates of the rate of the carbon perturbation vary,
but values of 0.3 2.2 Gt CO2 per year during an estimated span of up to
20,000 years have been proposed (Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011).
[Both these estimates are dwarfed in comparison to today's emissions of
roughly 30 Gt of CO2per year]{.underline} (IPCC, 2007c[). The current
rate of carbon release is at least 10 times that which preceded the last
major species extinction.]{.underline} [When comparing the rate of CO2
increase between today and the past, it is also important to realise
that carbon pertubations in Earth history, albeit slower than today,
were sustained over tens of thousands of years. Releasing similar
amounts of carbon on a much shorter timescale and causing a fast
perturbation adds two other important aspects:]{.underline} 1. This rate
is exceeding the Earth system's capacity to buffer such changes; 2. It
[exposes organisms to unprecedented evolutionary pressure.]{.underline}
At present[, it can be said with certainty that the uptake of CO2 into
the ocean is outstripping its capacity to absorb it, known as buffering
capacity, thereby coupling a reduction in pH tightly to a lowering of
its ''saturation state'']{.underline} (Cao and Caldeira, 2008; Ridgwell
and Schmidt, 2010). It is [this saturation state]{.underline}
(''buffering capacity'') [of the ocean]{.underline} that [mirrors the
critical impact of unbuffered acidiﬁcation and hypercapnia on the
functioning of most calcifying organisms, such as tropical reef-forming
corals but also planktonic organisms that are at the base of pelagic
food webs,]{.underline} especially in the vulnerable Arctic and
Antarctic regions. [If the current trajectory of carbon perturbation
continues, we should expect more serious consequences for the marine
ecosystem than during the PETM because of more severe acidiﬁcation and
carbonate dissolution in the present and near future]{.underline}.
Evidence of impacts of this event on marine ecosystems is restricted to
analysis of microfossils where 30--50% of benthic foraminferans were
found to have gone extinct (McInerney and Wing, 2011). Although, this
marks the largest loss of species in this group over the last 90 million
years, the interesting question of the PETM is why its long-term
consequences seem to have been so small for marine organisms, as
deep-sea benthic foraminiferans are ''small potatoes'' in the overall
diversity of life. Although, pelagic ecosystems also underwent
signiﬁcant changes with tropical groups of pelagic foraminifera
occurring at high latitudes and an increase in warm-water groups
occurring in mid- and low-latitudes (McInerney and Wing, 2011), this
level of extinction was not reﬂected in any other group for which data
exist, such as the ostracods. [Today, there are also accounts of
''winners and losers'' but this may not reﬂect the overall ecosystem
change in action]{.underline}. Is it possible that the role of
temperature and especially hypoxia may have been less during the PETM?
Last but not least, [it is worth noting that the ocean's chemical
restoration after the PETM took ca. 170,000 years]{.underline} (Cui et
al., 2011), which is equivalent to \>5000 human generations (generation
time of 30 years). For comparison, [this is longer than many estimates
of the existence of species Homo sapiens, and the earliest known hominid
dates back only 4.4 million years.]{.underline} In addition, [the marine
ecosystem as we know it today mainly evolved during a time of low
atmospheric CO2 and well-buffered seawater which is no longer the
case.]{.underline} Regardless of whether or not an extinction event has
started, [the current carbon perturbation will have huge implications
for humans]{.underline}. It is difﬁcult to predict how a possible mass
extinction will affect society, but [the current carbon perturbation
might be the most dramatic challenge faced by our exponentially growing
world population ever since the ﬁrst hominids evolved]{.underline}. [The
developed society lives above the carrying capacity of the Earth and its
ocean and, more than ever, we need to reduce the pressure of all
stressors, especially CO2 emissions.]{.underline}

[Although current emissions are tracking the higher scenarios, it is

record shows that some countries have reduced CO2 emissions over 10-year

[Climate resilient pathways are development trajectories of combined

sustainable development that [help avoid "dangerous anthropogenic

Article 2 of the Convention. Article 2 of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) outlines its ultimate objective as
the[, 'stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with
the climate system... in order to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to
climate change,]{.underline} to ensure that food production is not
threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a
sustainable manner'. Article 3.4 of the Convention recognizes that
'Parties have a right to, and should promote sustainable development'.
[Number of recent decisions]{.underline} by the Conference of the
Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC [has attempted to recognize the scientific
view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees
Celsius and encourage long-term cooperative action to combat climate
change]{.underline}. The Decisions agreed in Cancun at COP 16 recognizes
'... [deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are required
according to science,]{.underline} and as documented in the Fourth
Assessment Report of the IPCC, [with a view to reducing global
greenhouse gas emissions so as to hold the increase in global average
temperature below 2°C]{.underline} above preindustrial
levels...consistent with science...\[and\] also recognizes the need to
consider... strengthening the long-term global goal on the basis of the
best available scientific knowledge'. In the preamble of the Cancun
Decisions highlights the central importance of the link between climate
change and employment and \'Realizes that addressing climate change
requires a paradigm shift towards building a low-carbon society that
offers substantial opportunities and ensures continued high growth and
sustainable development, based on innovative technologies and more
sustainable production and consumption and lifestyles, while ensuring a
just transition of the workforce that creates decent work and quality
jobs.\' (UNFCCC, 2011, Decision 1/CP16). The 2011 COP in a decision
known as the Durban Platform increases the strength of the language in
the decision 1/CP.17 to conclude, ['... climate change]{.underline}
represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human
societies and the planet and [thus requires to be urgently addressed ...
with a view to accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas
emissions.]{.underline}\...' This decision was followed by the decisions
adopted in Doha at the 18th Conference of the Parties that noted with
grave concern the significant gap between the aggregate effect of
Parties' mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of
greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with
having a likely chance of holding the increase in global average
temperature below 2 °C or 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. As such,
the current UNFCCC negotiations have adopted +2°C or 1.5 C as the
desirable target upper limit and equated this with "dangerous" in
Article 2.

And with humans continuing to burn fossil fuels for energy, global
warming is expected to compound the damage. Roughly 5 percent of species
worldwide are threatened with climate-related extinction if global
average temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels,
the report concluded. (The world has already warmed 1 degree.) "[If
climate change were the only problem we were facing, a lot of species
could probably move and adapt," Richard Pearson, an ecologist at the
University College of London, said. "But when populations are already
small and losing genetic diversity, when natural landscapes are already
fragmented, when plants and animals can't move to find newly suitable
habitats, then we have a real threat on our hands."]{.underline} The
dwindling number of species will not just make the world a less colorful
or wondrous place, the report noted. It also poses risks to people.

## Retaliation Advantage 

### 2AC\-\--Ext. Econ Impact 

#### Without the global economy, [trade expectations break down]{.underline} --- causes [nuclear war]{.underline}

**Tønnesson 15** \[Research Professor, Peace Research Institute Oslo;
Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University, 2015,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311\]

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and [negative trade expectations]{.mark} may
[generate tensions leading to trade wars]{.mark} among interdependent
states [that]{.mark} in turn **[increase]{.mark} the [risk of military
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach,
2014). The risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is
governed by an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015);
second, the risk of war between China and the US should not just be
analysed bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party
countries could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this
context it is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in
Northeast Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated
economically through production networks within a global system of trade
and finance (Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth,
[decisions for war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people,
who act on the basis of their future expectations]{.underline}.
International relations theory must be supplemented by foreign policy
analysis in order to assess the value attributed by national
decision-makers to economic development and their assessments of risks
and opportunities. [[If leaders]{.mark} on either side of the Atlantic
begin to [seriously]{.mark} fear or [anticipate]{.mark} their own
nation's [decline]{.mark} then [they may blame]{.mark} this on [external
dependence]{.mark}, appeal to anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the
[use]{.mark} of [force]{.mark} to gain respect or credibility, adopt
protectionist policies, [and]{.mark} ultimately **[refuse to be deterred
by]{.mark}** either **[nuclear arms]{.mark}** or prospects of
socioeconomic calamities. Such a dangerous shift could happen
**abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the instigation of actions by a
third party --- or against a third party. Yet as long as there is both
nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the tensions [in East
Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As Chan (2013) says,
all states in the region are aware that they cannot count on support
from either China or the US if they make provocative moves. [[The
greatest risk is]{.mark} not that a territorial dispute leads to war
under present circumstances but [that **changes in the world
economy**]{.mark} alter those circumstances in ways that [render
inter-state peace]{.mark} more [precarious]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
China and the US fail to rebalance their financial and trading relations
(Roach, 2014) then a trade war could result, interrupting transnational
production networks, provoking social distress, and exacerbating
nationalist emotions. [This could have unforeseen consequences in the
field of security, with nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to
protect the world from Armageddon, and unreliably so]{.underline}.
**[[Deterrence could lose]{.mark} its [credibility]{.mark}: one of the
two [great powers might gamble]{.mark} that the other yield [in a
cyber]{.mark}-war [or conventional]{.mark} limited
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or third party countries might engage in
conflict with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing
to intervene.

#### Trump escalates economic decline 

**Homer-Dixon 17** (March 19^th^, 2017, Thomas, CIGI chair of global
systems in the Balsillie School of International Affairs, "Crisis
analysis: How much damage can Trump do? (A lot),"
<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/crisis-analysis-how-much-damage-can-trump-do-a-lot/article34341100/>)

As Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence
Committee, tweeted on March 6: "We must accept possibility that [POTUS
**does not know**]{.underline} fact from fiction, **[right from
wrong]{.underline}**. That wild claims are not strategic, but worse."
The entirely predictable chaos of the new administration's first weeks
has many liberals fantasizing that Mr. Trump will be removed from office
before his term finishes. But we've seen enough of him to know he's
unlikely to leave willingly through any legitimate and lawful political
mechanism, like impeachment. Instead, [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr.
[[Trump **feels cornered**, he'll]{.mark} declare that his enemies are
**conspiring against him** and call his supporters]{.underline} -- many
of [whom are **heavily armed**]{.underline} -- [to **come to his
aid**]{.underline}. It's also possible that Mr. Trump will find his
groove, allowing things to settle down. Yet his performance so far
suggests [his administration will instead [lurch from **crisis** to
**crisis**]{.mark}.]{.underline} To make some sense of these outcomes,
I've charted the most likely crisis types. [[Drawing on **analysis**
by]{.mark} a **wide range of [scholars]{.mark}**[, I've]{.mark} also
**[estimated the probabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} of each type at
one, two, and five years into a Trump administration (the latter
timeline assumes that Trump is re-elected in 2020). There are four
principal types, I'd argue: financial crisis, civil violence,
authoritarianism, and war. Each crisis type then has various possible
levels of intensity. "Moderate" authoritarianism could involve, for
instance, use of federal resources to intimidate or constrain
journalists and judges; substantially increased application of force to
track, detain and deport immigrants; and criminalization of protest. Mr.
Trump, or in the case of criminalization of protest, his acolytes at the
state level are already checking some of these boxes, so I estimate the
probability of this degree of authoritarianism in the administration's
first year to be 70 per cent. "Severe" authoritarianism would involve
actions like a declaration of a state of emergency, federalization of
the National Guard, or suspension of key civil liberties. This outcome
is much less likely; even after five years, I don't think it's higher
than 30 per cent. [A]{.underline} "moderate" war
[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, by my definition, [[would include
**any**]{.mark} **regional conflict** between the United States and an
**intermediate**]{.underline} power like Iran, [or]{.underline} a
**[[great power]{.underline}]{.mark}** like China, say in the South
China Sea. "Severe" war would involve use of massed military force
against a great power like Russia. The category would also include [any
conflict]{.underline}, for instance, with North Korea, that [[carries a
**substantial risk** of **nuclear escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
part, [because of Mr. Trump's **expressed hostility** towards Iran and
China, and his tendency to see **all international relations** in
**zero-sum terms**, I estimate the]{.underline} five-year [probability
of a]{.underline} "moderate" [war crisis to be **high**]{.underline}, at
60 per cent. The four crisis types are likely to be causally linked. In
particular, [civil violence]{.underline} or war [could create conditions
that Mr. Trump might use to justify]{.underline} an authoritarian
[crackdown]{.underline}. Financial crisis could also be a consequence of
war. [The administration's decision-making incompetence increases the
risk of **financial crisis**, **civil violence**, and
**war**]{.underline}. For instance, Mr. [[Trump's]{.mark} team of
[advisers contains **little**]{.mark} **high-level [economic
expertise]{.mark}**[, so]{.mark} his administration [could be **out of
its depth** should]{.mark} **serious [trouble develop]{.mark}** [in
**financial systems**]{.mark}]{.underline} overseas, say in China or
Europe. [[The]{.mark} **specific [probabilities]{.mark}** that one plugs
into this model [are **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} entirely
[**[speculative]{.underline}**. [Experts]{.underline}]{.mark} [can argue
about the details, but they're **largely in [agree]{.mark}ment**
that]{.underline}, for instance, [[the **risk of nuclear war** has
**jumped**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is why The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists recently moved the minute-hand of its doomsday clock closer
to midnight.

• In Ireland, for example, the 2008 losses of three big banks equalled
700% of the nation's GDP. Somehow, the Irish government still decided to
bail them out --- "for fear of dying \[Ireland\] would commit suicide,"
Tooze writes. This effectively bankrupted the state. The same story
played out around the world to varying degrees of severity.

Tooze warns that [**[potential calamity]{.mark}** still **[lurks]{.mark}

#### Best statistical practices demonstrate causal relationship

**Tir 10** (Jaroslav Tir, PhD, professor of political science at
University of Colorado at Boulder, "Territorial Diversion: Diversionary
Theory of War and Territorial Conflict," The Journal of Politics, Vol.
72, No. 2, April 2010, pp. 413--425)

Hypothesis 1 thus receives strong support via the unpopularity variable
but only weak support via the economic growth variable. These [[results
suggest]{.mark} that embattled leaders are much more likely to respond
with territorial diversions to direct signs of their
unpopularity]{.underline} (e.g., strikes, protests, riots) [than to
general background conditions such as economic malaise.]{.underline}
Presumably, protesters can be distracted via territorial diversions
while ﬁxing the economy would take a more concerted and prolonged policy
effort. **[[Bad economic conditions]{.mark} seem to [motivate]{.mark}
only [the most serious, fatal territorial
confrontations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This implies that
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} may be [[reserv]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
the most high-proﬁle and **[[risky diversions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the times when they are the most desperate,
that is [when their power is threatened both by]{.underline} signs of
discontent with their rule and by more systemic problems plaguing the
country (i.e., [**[an underperforming economy]{.mark}**). Next, [I
conduct]{.mark} a series of follow-up [tests]{.mark}]{.underline}
suggested by an anonymous Reviewer; results based on the reanalysis of
Model 1 are presented in the online appendix. [Evaluating the
implication that territorial diversions]{.underline} are indeed **[more
likely to result from diversionary conditions than nonterritorial
diversions]{.underline}**, I set up a multinomial logit model that
contrasts the initiation of territorial MIDs versus nonterritorial MIDs
(base outcome). The results show a positive and statistically signiﬁcant
coefﬁcient for the government unpopularity variable (ﬁrst column of
Table 3), meaning that higher levels of government unpopularity are more
likely to produce territorial rather than nonterritorial MIDs. [Further
checks]{.underline} **[include [performing rare events]{.mark}
logit]{.underline}** (King and Zeng 2001) [**[and population-averaged
logit analyses]{.mark}** to verify whether the rare events nature of the
dependent variable or cross-sectional characteristics of the data alter
the ﬁndings, respectively]{.underline}. [[The
ﬁndings]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the two independent
variables]{.underline} **[[remain unchanged]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see
Table 3, columns two and three). Finally, protesting behavior in more
populous countries could be considered more ''normal'' and less
threatening to the government, potentially lowering the incentive to
divert. Dividing the government unpopularity variable by the log of
country's population (from the Correlates of War National Capabilities
data set, Singer 1987) reveals that the population size-standardized
government unpopularity variable remains positive and signiﬁcant; see
Table 3, ﬁnal column. Concerning the control variables, the effects of
power and distance are consistent with expectations and across the
Models in Table 1. Democracy, alliance ties, and trade coefﬁcients have
mostly the expected dampening inﬂuence on territorial conﬂict
initiation; but only trade exhibits a signiﬁcant impact and only when
the dependent variable is the fatal territorial MID (i.e., in Models
3--4). 16 These results are somewhat surprising, but the reader is
reminded that the effects of alliance are highly contested (see Maoz
2000), while the impact of trade has not been established in the domain
of territorial conﬂict. Similarly, recent research shows that the
[democratic peace weakens considerably in the context of territorial
conﬂict]{.underline} (James, Park, and Choi 2006) [and that the
democratic peace may be epiphenomenal to territorial peace]{.underline}
(Gibler 2007). [17 Importantly, the control variable results imply that
some of the related interests]{.underline} (e.g., security, regime ties)
[may indeed be subordinated to the territorial diversion impetus.
Revisiting the link between regime type and diversion, some scholars
argue that democratic leaders have a greater
motivation]{.underline}---due to the need for popular support---[for
diversion]{.underline} (e.g., Gelpi 1997; Russett 1990; Smith 1996).
[Yet, others]{.underline} (e.g., Downs and Rocke 1994; Miller 1995;
Pickering and Kisangani 2005) [assert that authoritarian leaders need
popular support in order to appear legitimate**.**]{.underline} Because
they cannot derive legitimacy from democratic institutions and
elections, they look to diversions to help them achieve this goal.
Autocrats can also divert with greater impunity due to the lack of
institutional checks and balances. In follow-up tests available from the
online appendix, Table 4, I restrict the set of initiator countries in
Model 1 to democracies only, autocracies only, all nondemocracies, and
all nonautocracies. That [the [ﬁndings]{.mark} hold [suggest]{.mark}s
**that [both democratic and autocratic leaders value territorial
diversions]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Nevertheless, resolving the broader
debate is beyond the scope of this study.

#### Economic decline causes global war -- statistics and diversionary theory prove

**Royal 10** (Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction -- U.S.
Department of Defense, "Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the
Problem of Economic Crises", Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal
and Political Perspectives, Ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)

Less intuitive is how periods of [economic [decline]{.mark} may
**[increase the likelihood of]{.mark} external
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Political science literature has
contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic
decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states.
Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and
national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the
systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson\'s (1996)
work on leadership cycle theory, finding that [rhy[thms in the global
economy are associated with the **rise and fall of a**]{.mark}
**pre-eminent [power and the]{.mark}**]{.underline} often [**[bloody
transition]{.mark}** from one pre-eminent leader to the
next]{.underline}. As such, exogenous shocks such as [economic [crises
could]{.mark} usher in a redistribution of relative power]{.underline}
(see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances,
[[increasi]{.mark}ng [the risk of
**miscalculation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively,
[even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a
permissive environment for conflict]{.underline} as a rising power may
seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins
(1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel
leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium
and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections
between global economic conditions and security conditions remain
unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland\'s (1996, 2000) theory of
trade expectations suggests that \'[future [expectation of trade\' is
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**significant variable** in
understanding]{.mark} economic conditions and security [behaviour of
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. He argues that interdependent states are
likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an
optimistic view of future trade relations. However, [if the expectations
of future trade decline]{.underline}, particularly for difficult to
replace items such as energy resources, [the likelihood for conflict
increases**,** as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to
those resources. Crises could]{.underline} potentially be the
[trigger]{.underline} for [decreased trade expectations]{.underline}
either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by
interdependent states.4 Third, [others have considered the link between
economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level.
Blomberg and Hess]{.underline} (2002) [find a strong correlation between
internal conflict and external conflict, particularly
during]{.underline} periods of [economic downturn]{.underline}. They
write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and
prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends
to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover,
the [presence of [a recession]{.mark} [tends to amplify]{.mark} the
extent to which [international]{.mark} and external [conflicts]{.mark}
self-reinforce each other]{.underline}. (Blomberg & Hess, 2002. p. 89)
[Economic [decline has]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[been linked with an
**increase in the likelihood of terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Blomberg, Hess, & Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill
across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises
generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government.
[**\"[Diversionary theory\"]{.mark}** [suggests]{.mark}]{.underline}
that, [when facing unpopularity arising from economic
decline]{.underline}, sitting [[governments have]{.mark} increased
[incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a \'rally
around the flag\']{.mark}]{.underline} [[effect]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find
supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are
at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and
Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that [the tendency towards
diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states]{.underline} than
autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally
more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic
support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that [[periods of
weak economic performance in the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, and thus weak Presidential popularity,
[[are **statistically linked** to an increase in the use of
force]{.underline}.]{.mark} In summary, recent economic scholarship
positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the
frequency of economic crises, whereas [political science scholarship
links economic decline with external conflict]{.underline} [at systemic,
dyadic and national levels]{.underline}.5 This implied connection
between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured
prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.

President Donald [[Trump has]{.underline}]{.mark}, at almost every turn,

**[[consequence]{.underline}]{.mark}** or any of the nightmare scenarios
that President Barack [Obama warned against]{.underline}. Under Trump,
[the US has withdrawn from the Iran]{.underline} nuclear
[deal]{.underline}, a move Obama officials warned could send the country
sprinting toward a nuclear weapon. [[Iran **remains in
compliance**]{.underline}]{.mark} with the deal today. Trump\'s White
House plans to sanction Iran\'s oil exports in November, and despite
warnings of oil prices spiking or European firms picking Tehran over
Washington, [**oil prices** are **steady**]{.underline} and even India,
a longtime client of Iran\'s, has cut ties. [[Despite the pain Iran
took]{.underline}]{.mark} from Trump\'s sanctions,
**[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}** contacted by Business Insider
[[expect it to **remain in the deal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They say
[[the]{.mark} [country has **few**]{.mark} **remaining [economic
lifelines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [publicly [breaching the deal to
**go nuclear** could **snuff out**]{.mark} the **[remaining
embers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The US military in Syria has repeatedly
and stiffly beaten back Iranian and Iranian-linked forces when
challenged. Under Obama, the US sought to give Iran a wide berth in
Syria as it worked behind the scenes to reach the Iran nuclear deal. In
the Strait of Hormuz, a key waterway outside Iran, Iranian ships would
frequently harass and threaten US Navy ships. Under Trump, Iran has
stopped these provocations. \"The president is doing the opposite of
what the experts said, and it seems to be working out,\" Michael Lynch,
the president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, told The New
York Times. Iran is struggling, and the US is fine Since Trump took
office, [[Iran]{.mark} has [weathered a series of **withering

### 2AC\-\--Ext. Iran Proliferation

#### Iran nuclear weapons would [erode global nonprolif]{.underline} and cause [nuke war]{.underline}

Security and an associate professor in the Security Studies Program at
Georgetown. If All Else Fails The Challenges of Containing a
Nuclear-Armed Iran.
www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_IfAllElseFails.pdf\]

Numerous commentators and officials have warned that [[if
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} defies the international community and
[[develops nuclear weapons, it could **fatally undermine**]{.mark} the
**[NPT]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, as the National Intelligence
Council noted in December of 2012, [Iranian [nuclear acquisition "could
trigger an]{.mark} [**arms race** in the Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark},
undermining the nonproliferation regime]{.underline}."79 Many fear that
[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, which views Iran as its principal threat and
rival for regional influence, would quickly follow Iran into the nuclear
club (perhaps by acquiring nuclear weapons from Pakistan) and that
[Turkey, Egypt and]{.underline} possibly [other Middle Eastern states
would not be far behind]{.underline}. Second, the **[failure to prevent
Iran from developing nuclear weapons could undermine international
respect for the NPT and gut the credibility of U.S. counterproliferation
efforts]{.underline}**. The United Nations (U.N.) Security Council has
passed six resolutions since 2006 demanding that Iran comply with its
NPT obligations. Three successive American administrations have also
described Iranian nuclear weapons acquisition as "unacceptable,"
pledging to do whatever it takes to stop Iran before it gets the bomb.
[If Iran]{.underline} nevertheless [succeeds in developing nuclear
weapons, other states may conclude that the NPT is toothless and that
Washington, in particular, lacks the capability and the will to enforce
member states' nonproliferation obligations]{.underline}. Finally, [a
nuclear-armed [**Tehran**]{.mark} could itself become a supplier of
proliferation materials]{.underline}. Even if Iran does not give
operational nuclear weapons to allied states [or]{.underline} non-state
actors, i[t might consider providing others with sensitive nuclear
assistance, such as centrifuge components or warhead designs. In this
way, Tehran could pass sensitive technology to Hezbollah or help
[**jumpstart** nuclear programs in]{.mark} allied countries such as
[Sudan or Venezuela]{.mark},]{.underline} much as Pakistan's AQ Khan
network allegedly facilitated proliferation efforts in Iran, Iraq, Libya
and North Korea. **[[Any of these]{.mark} scenarios [could spark]{.mark}
a wave of [additional proliferation]{.mark}, [leading to]{.mark} the
emergence of [multiple nuclear rivals in]{.mark} the Middle East or
other [volatile regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Such]{.mark}
multipolar nuclear competitions, in turn, [could **greatly
complicate**]{.mark} stable [deterrence]{.mark} by making attribution
for nuclear attacks trickier, creating difficulties for calculating the
sufficiency and vulnerability of nuclear arsenals and
**[multiplying]{.mark}** the [scenarios for]{.mark} crisis
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation.]{.underline} **[[Even if all]{.mark} the
relevant [parties were]{.mark} [rational]{.mark}, the [prospects

#### Iran prolif de-Stabilizes the Region 

**Kahl 12** (COLIN H. KAHL, associate Professor at Georgetown
University, September 2012. \"Iran and the Bomb: Would a Nuclear Iran
Make the Middle East More Secure?\" One Step Too Far\", Foreign Affairs,
Vol. 91, No. 5)

Kenneth [[**Waltz**]{.underline}]{.mark} is probably right that a
nuclear-armed Iran could be deterred from deliberately using nuclear
weapons or transferring a nuclear device to terrorists (\"Why Iran
Should Get the Bomb,\" July/ August 2012). But he [[is **dead wrong**
that the Islamic Republic would likely become a **more responsible**
]{.mark}**international [actor]{.mark}** [if it crossed the nuclear
threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}. In making that argument, [[Waltz
**mischaracterizes** Iranian motivations and **badly misreads
history**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} And despite the fact that Waltz is
one of the world s most respected inter- national relations theorists,
[he ignores important political science research into the effects of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, including recent findings that suggest
that new nuclear states are often more reckless and aggressive at lower
levels of conflict. RATIONAL BUT DANGEROUS [Waltz correctly notes that
Iran\'s leaders, despite their fanatical rhetoric, are fundamentally
rational]{.underline}. Because Iran\'s leadership is not suicidal, it is
highly unlikely that a nuclear-armed Iran would deliberately use a
nuclear device or transfer one to terrorists. [Yet [**even though** the
Islamic Republic is rational, it is **still dangerous**, and it is
likely to become **even more so** if it develops **nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Iran\'s government currently sponsors
terrorist groups and supports militants throughout the Middle
East]{.underline}, in part to demonstrate a capability to retaliate
against the United States, Israel, and other states should they attack
Iran or undermine its interests. [If the Iranian leadership\'s sole
concern was its own survival and it believed that a nuclear deterrent
alone could give it enough protection, then as a nuclear state, it might
curtail its support for proxies]{.underline} in order to avoid needless
disputes with other nuclear powers. But [Iran is not a status quo state,
and its support for terrorists and militants is intended to be for more
than just defense and retaliation. Such support is an offensive
tool]{.underline}, [designed to pressure and intimidate other states,
indirectly expand Iran\'s influ- ence, and advance its revisionist
agenda]{.underline}, which seeks to make Iran the preeminent power in
the Middle East, champion resistance to Israel and \"arrogant powers\"
in the West, promote its brand of revolu- tionary Islamist ideology, and
assert its leadership in the wider Islamic world. [Tehran currently
calibrates its support for militants and sponsorship of terrorism to
minimize the risks of a direct confron- tation]{.underline} with more
powerful states. But if Iranian leaders perceived that a nuclear arsenal
provided a substantially more robust deterrent against retaliation, they
would likely pursue their regional goals more aggressively
[Specifically, [a nuclear-armed Tehran would]{.mark} likely [**provide
Hezbollah and Palestinian militants** with more]{.mark} sophisti- cated,
longer-range, and more accurate conventional [**weaponry**]{.mark} for
use against Israel]{.underline}. In an effort to bolster the deterrent
capabilities of such allies, [Iran might con- sider giving them
\"dual-capable\" weapons, leaving Israel to guess whether these systems
were conventional or armed with chemical, biological, or nuclear
material]{.underline}. [A nuclear-armed Iran might also give its proxies
permission to use advanced weapons systems]{.underline} instead of
keeping them in reserve, as Tehran reportedly instructed Hezbollah to do
during the militant group\'s 2006 war with Israel. [A **nuclear-armed
Iran**]{.underline}, [believing that it possessed a powerful deterrent
and could thus commit violence abroad with near impunity, might also
increase the **frequency and scale** of the terrorist
attacks]{.underline} against U.S. and Israeli targets carried out by
Hezbollah and the Quds Force, the covert operations wing of Iran\'s
elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [And a bolder Iran might
increase the number of Revolutionary Guard forces it deployed to
Lebanon, allow its navy to engage in more frequent shows of force in the
Mediterranean, and assert itself more aggressively in the Persian Gulf
and the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}. To further enhance its image in
the eyes of domestic and regional audiences as the leader of an
anti-Western resistance bloc, a nuclear-armed Iran might respond to
regional crises by threatening to use all the means at its disposal to
ensure the survival of the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah, or
Palestinian groups. And [**[Iran]{.mark}** [might be
**emboldened**]{.mark} to play the spoiler in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process [by]{.mark} [encouraging]{.mark} **[large-scale militant
attacks]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} might [try to]{.mark} **[destabilize its
neighbors]{.mark}** through more coercive diplomacy]{.underline} and
subversion in Iraq and the Gulf states.

#### Iranian nuclear weapons would encourage adventurism- increases the risk of escalation- Waltz has deterrence wrong

**Kahl 12** (COLIN H. KAHL, associate Professor at Georgetown
University, September 2012. \"Iran and the Bomb: Would a Nuclear Iran
Make the Middle East More Secure?\" One Step Too Far\", Foreign Affairs,
Vol. 91, No. 5)

[If deterrence operates the way Waltz expects it to, a nuclear-armed
Iran might reduce the risk of a major conventional war]{.underline}
among Middle Eastern states. [[But **history suggests** that Tehran\'s
development of nuclear weapons would **encourage Iranian adventurism**,
leading to **more frequent and intense crises** in the Middle East. Such
crises]{.mark} would [entail]{.mark} some inherent risk of a [**nuclear
exchange** resulting from a **miscalculation, an accident, or**
]{.mark}**an [unauthorized use]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}- a risk
that currently does not exist at all. [The threat would be particularly
high in the initial period after Iran joined the nuclear
club]{.underline}. Once the superpowers reached rough nuclear parity
during the Cold War, for example, the number of direct crises decreased,
and the associated risks of nuclear escalation abated. But [during the
early years of the Cold War, the superpowers were involved in several
crises]{.underline}, and on at least one occasion - the 1962 Cuban
missile crisis - [they came perilously close to nuclear
war]{.underline}. Similarly, [a stable deterrent relationship between
Iran,]{.underline} on the one hand, [and the United States and
Israel]{.underline}, on the other, [would likely emerge over time, but
the initial crisis-prone years would be **hair-raising**]{.underline}.
[Although all sides would have a profound interest in not allowing
events to spiral out of control, [the]{.mark} residual [risk of
**inadvertent escalation** stemming from **decades of distrust and
hostility**, the **absence of** ]{.mark}**direct [lines of
communication]{.mark}**[, and **organizational mistakes** would
be]{.mark} nontrivial]{.underline} - [and the consequences of even a
low-probability outcome could be **[devastating]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Arguments about deterrence and rationality miss the boat. A nuclear Iran results in aggressive terrorism and WMD access.

**Etzioni 10** (Amitai -- professor of international relations at George
Washington University, Can a Nuclear-Armed Iran Be Deterred, Military
Review, p. 123)

[[Even if Iran never drops its nukes]{.underline}]{.mark} on anybody,
[once it demonstrates that it has acquired them]{.underline}--- say, by
testing them---[[these weapons would have]{.mark} **considerable
[consequences]{.mark}** [for our **security**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
that of our allies. [Desch]{.underline} correctly [reports, "The concern
is that once [Iran]{.mark} develops a nuclear capability, it [would
become even **more aggressive** in supporting]{.mark}]{.underline}
terrorist groups like [[Hezbollah]{.mark} in Lebanon [or Hamas]{.mark}
in Gaza]{.underline} . . . Finally, [many Americans fear that once Iran
ﬁelds a nuclear weapon, [it will become ever more **meddlesome in
Iraq**." The]{.mark} side [effects]{.mark} of allowing Iran to obtain
nukes [are]{.mark} well [spelled out by]{.mark}]{.underline} Emanuele
[[Ottolenghi, the executive director of the Transatlantic
Institute]{.underline}]{.mark} in Brussels. I hence quote him at some
length. He writes-- The fact is that an Iranian bomb would enable Tehran
to fulﬁll the goals of the revolution without using it. [[A nuclear bomb
is a **force multiplier**]{.underline}]{.mark} that, as U.S. President
Barack Obama aptly said, constitutes a 'game changer.' [Iran's success
will change the Middle East forever]{.underline}---and for the worse.
[[Under an Iranian]{.mark} nuclear [umbrella, terrorists will]{.mark} be
able to [act with impunity, and]{.mark} its [neighbors will enter
into]{.mark} a dangerous [arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}. Less
understood are the dynamics that will emerge if Iran chooses not to use
the bomb against its enemies. [[It matters little that Tehran may act
**rationally**]{.mark}. If Iran goes nuclear, [the]{.mark} Western
[world will have to negotiate]{.mark} a Middle East Yalta with
Tehran---one [that may **entail a U.S.
withdrawal**]{.mark}]{.underline}, an unpleasant bargain for the smaller
principalities of the Gulf's shores and an unacceptable one for Israel
and Lebanon's Christians. Last but not least is the risk that
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, or some other rogue nation, [[will **slip a
nuke**]{.mark} or two [to terrorists, or]{.mark} they will [obtain one
**without consent**]{.mark} **of the leaders** [with the help
of]{.mark}]{.underline} one group or another, such as [[the
Revolutionary Guard]{.mark}. The champions of [deterrence]{.mark} argue
that it sufﬁces to deter such nations from sharing nukes]{.underline}
with terrorists [for us to declare that if terrorists use such weapons,
we will hold responsible]{.underline} the nation that provided them.
However, [this argument [assumes a **much more reliable level** of
nuclear forensics]{.mark} than we command]{.underline} so far. [[We
may]{.mark} well [be unable to determine the source]{.mark} of a
bomb]{.underline}, or it will take months, after which striking a nation
with nuclear bombs in cold blood may well not seem a very credible
counterthreat. One hardly needs to elaborate any further that even if
Iran can be deterred from employing its nukes directly, there are strong
reasons to favor an Iran without nukes.

[[Saudi Arabia would be **very likely** to try to **follow Iran across
the nuclear threshold**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Should it do so, [[the
world would face t]{.mark}he possibility of [an **Iran-Saudi nuclear
exchange**]{.mark}]{.underline}---a catastrophic humanitarian event that
would threaten the entirety of Gulf oil exports for an extended period
of time. In early 2008, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
concluded: "[If Iran obtains a nuclear weapon, it will place
**tremendous pressure** on Saudi Arabia to follow suit]{.underline}."19
By 2012, some experts believe it has already begun to do so. Two main
factors could drive Saudi Arabia to pursue a nuclear weapon: (1) a
decades-long Saudi-Iran cold war waged along sectarian, religious,
ethnic, and geopolitical lines and (2) a deep-seated competition over
the energy policies that form the lifeblood of both regimes. The Sunni
Saudi monarchy and Shiite Iranian theocracy each claim leadership of the
Islamic world. This sectarian competition for primacy is reinforced by
ethnic differences: Saudi Arabia is the largest and most populous Arab
country astride the Gulf, but it is dwarfed by Iran's much larger
Persian-majority population. These competing claims have pitted the two
countries in an enduring cold war and proxy conflict spanning from
Lebanon to Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula. Iran---under both the Shah
and the ayatollahs---has routinely sought to use its conventional
military capabilities, large population, geostrategic position,
expansive resources, and ties to armed groups to shift the balance of
power in the Persian Gulf in its favor and at the expense of its Sunni
Arab neighbors.20 [As a result, [Saudi Arabia has made it clear it views
a nuclear-capable Iran as an existential threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
2008, King Abdullah urged the United States to "cut off the head of the
snake," one instance of his "frequent exhortations \[to\] the United
States to attack Iran to put an end to its nuclear weapons program,"
according to U.S. diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks.21 With
uncertain prospects for a halt to Iran's nuclear program---peaceful or
otherwise---in 2009, the King informed a senior American official, "If
\[Iran\] gets nuclear weapons, we will get nuclear weapons." This year,
senior Saudi officials reiterated that "it would be completely
unacceptable to have Iran with a nuclear capability and not the kingdom
\[of Saudi Arabia\]."22 [Rather than lose time developing an indigenous
nuclear program, it is likely the Saudi kingdom would seek to obtain a
nuclear warhead from Pakistan]{.underline} ready to mount on its CSS-2
ballistic missiles. [Close Saudi-Pakistani security ties date back to
shared Cold War--era interests, and it is widely believed that Riyadh
bankrolled Islamabad's nuclear weapons program with the stipulation that
Pakistan would sell nuclear devices to Saudi Arabia in an
emergency]{.underline}; in the words of a senior Saudi official,
"**[within weeks]{.underline}**."23 Pakistan would benefit by receiving
much-needed cash and could demand in return dual-key authority over
missile launches, both to control Saudi policy and to bolster its own
secondstrike capability against India. At best, [[this would create a
**nuclear-armed standoff**]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two most
powerful and mutually antagonistic countries in the Persian Gulf. At
worst[, [it could **devolve into atomic warfare**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Iran's and Saudi Arabia's **small arsenals**,]{.mark} **lack of
durable communication channels**, **[poor civilian oversight]{.mark}**
of command-and-control systems, **[erratic intelligence]{.mark}**,
**proximity** to each other, **religious ardor**, and [**sectarian
divide** would all **distinguish** this scenario]{.mark} from the Cold
War balance]{.underline} between the United States and the Soviet Union.
[Any [such conflict]{.mark} [would]{.mark} likely [be **extremely
devastating**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each country would have natural
incentives to cripple its opponent's oil facilities in any nuclear
conflict. Crudeoil exports are both regimes' political and economic
lifeblood, and thus the basis for their military power. Also, each
country's oil infrastructure and export terminals are concentrated along
the Gulf, within range of the other's nuclear-weapons delivery vehicles.
Moreover, [a nuclear war]{.underline} in this region [would likely not
only destroy a large portion of the Gulf's oil infrastructure
but]{.underline} also [render the entire Gulf
**unavailable**]{.underline} to shipping for some period of time. [This
could come directly through radioactive fallout, atmospheric pollution,
and environmental destruction]{.underline}, or indirectly through
prohibitively high insurance rates [and other risk factors]{.underline}
for tankers transiting the region.24 Therefore, even if a nuclear
exchange did not spread into a region-wide war, the transit of
Hormuz-bound oil exports would be halted by such a conflict.

[[A nuclear Iran would]{.underline}]{.mark} immediately
[[encounter]{.underline}]{.mark} another nuclear state---even if an
undeclared one---in the region: [[Israel]{.underline}.]{.mark} Compared
with the relative stability of the Cold War, [[an initial
stalemate]{.mark} between Israel and Iran [would be highly
precarious]{.mark} at best [and would]{.mark}]{.underline} also
**[[threaten the entirety of Gulf exports]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
although for a more limited duration. [Were Iran to become nuclear, the
frequency of crises and [proxy conflicts]{.mark} between Iran and Israel
[would **likely increase**]{.mark}, as would the probability of such
confrontations **[spiraling into a nuclear
exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with horrendous humanitarian
consequences. [[There could be]{.mark} an Israeli-Iranian nuclear
exchange through **[miscalculatio]{.mark}n**]{.underline} and/or
miscommunication. [There could]{.underline} also [be a calculated
nuclear exchange, as [the]{.mark} Israeli and Iranian [sides would
**each have incentives to strike the other first**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Tehran would likely have the ability to produce only a small handful of
weapons, whereas Israel is already estimated to possess more than 100
devices, including 24thermonuclear warheads far beyond the destructive
power of any Iranian fission weapon. Under such circumstances, [[Iran's
vulnerability]{.mark} to a bolt-from-the-blue Israeli nuclear strike
[would actually **increase its incentive**]{.mark} to launch its own
nuclear attack, lest its arsenal be obliterated. Israel's
small]{.underline} territorial [size reduces the survivability of its
second-strike capability]{.underline} and, more importantly, the
survivability of the country itself, despite its vastly larger and more
advanced arsenal. [Thus, Israeli leaders might feel the need to act
**preventatively to eliminate the Iranian arsenal**]{.underline} before
it can be used against them, just as American military planners
contemplated taking out the fledgling Soviet arsenal early in the Cold
War, except that as a much smaller country Israel has far less room for
maneuver.26

### 2AC\-\--Ext. Arm Sales -\> Retaliation 

#### New advanced arm sales to Taiwan [threaten]{.underline} aggressive Chinese retaliation against the US 

**SN 17** (Sputnik News, citing Andrei Karneev, deputy head of the
Institute of Asia and Africa at Moscow State University, June 20, 2017.
"Waking the Dragon: **[US Arms Sales to Taiwan Bound to Spark a Backlash
From China]{.underline}**."
https://sputniknews.com/asia/201706201054807711-us-arms-sales-taiwan/)

[US **[lawmakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[have]{.underline}]{.mark}
recently [[called]{.mark} on the Trump administration [to **speed up
arms sales to Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline} [as tensions between the
self-governing island and mainland China continue to
**escalate**]{.underline}. While [[the move]{.underline}]{.mark} has
been welcomed by the Taiwanese authorities, Russian political analyst
Andrei Karneev told Sputnik it [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[definitely spark a backlash from China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [On
Thursday, the lawmakers in the United States called for the Trump
administration to speed up the arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. The
calls came after the Central American nation Panama announced that it
was switching ties from Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, to Beijing and
amid the escalated tensions between Taiwan and the mainland China. \"I
remain concerned about successive administrations' delays in arms sales
notification for Taiwan, which have needlessly dragged out the arms
sales process,\" Ed Royce, the chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs
Committee, told the hearing in Washington on Thursday. Royce said he
hoped to see regular notifications in the future and looked forward to
the announcement of new sales this year. The Taiwanese Foreign Ministry
and the Mainland Affairs Council have both expressed gratitude to
**[American leaders]{.underline}** who [have been **pushing for the arms
deal**]{.underline}. US officials told Reuters in March that President
Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[was
orchestrating]{.underline}]{.mark} [[a **major arms sale to
Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[advanced]{.mark} rocket [systems]{.mark} and anti-ship
missiles]{.underline}**. It may exceed the \$1.8 billion deal former
President Barack Obama inked with Taiwanese leadership in December 2015.
In total, the Obama administration sold \$14 billion worth of weapons to
the Taiwanese, compared to about \$30 billion under the preceding Bush
administration and about \$18 billion under Bill Clinton. But the White
House itself has been tight-lipped about such a deal, with leaders
offering assurances and supportive remarks but little in the way of
concrete details. Both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of
Defense James Mattis have expressed the American commitment to a defense
relationship with Taiwan in recent weeks, but offered not much besides
that. Even though during his talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping
President Trump voiced his support of the \"One China\" policy, the
[political analyst doubted that he will cancel or substantially decrease
the military aid program to Taiwan]{.underline}. The terms, volumes and
the actual arms deliveries will be subject to discussions. Karneev also
doubted that there will be any speedy decisions on the issue in the wake
of Trump\'s ongoing negotiation with Beijing on the North Korean nuclear
program. However even if this cooperation proves a success, [Washington
won\'t give up its \"Taiwanese lever\" on China]{.underline}. [[The **US
Congress**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, won\'t leave its attempts to
[[force the]{.mark} [White House to **increase** ]{.mark}**the [arms
sales]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline} in comparison to those
approved by the Obama administration, he said. Dan Blumenthal, a former
senior director for China, Taiwan, and Mongolia at the US Department of
Defense urged the Trump administration to include Taiwan in its Asia
Pacific strategy, particularly on the South China Sea issue. It might
also [[include]{.underline}]{.mark} the deliveries of the advances fifth
generation **[[F-35]{.underline}]{.mark}** multirole
[[fighters]{.underline}]{.mark}. Blumenthal said a key issue is whether
Taiwan can afford the aircraft\'s exorbitant costs, adding that many
other options are available for US-Taiwan security cooperation. It still
remains to be seen, when [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[new package of
the US arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}** to Taiwan will be approved, he
said, however [[it is]{.mark} **only [too clear]{.mark}** [that China
will regard it as an attempt to **undermine**
]{.mark}**China**]{.underline}-US ties as well a peace and
[[stability]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Taiwan Strait.

## AT: Credibility DA 

### 2AC Credibility DA -- Trump Thumps 

#### Trump thumps any NATO stability

**Burns & Lute 4/2 (**Nicholas Burns is a Former Secretary of State for
Public Affairs and Douglas Lute is the former United States Permanent
Representative to the North Atlantic Council), "NATO's Biggest Problem
is Trump", The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/natos-biggest-problem-is-president-trump/2019/04/02/6991bc9c-5570-11e9-9136-f8e636f1f6df_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0280c8651966

As NATO marks its 70th anniversary this week, this unique, often
unwieldy, 29-member alliance is confronting one of the most difficult
sets of challenges in its history. **[NATO]{.underline}** is still the
world's strongest military alliance. But [its **single greatest danger**
is the absence of **strong**, principled American presidential
leadership for the **first time** in its history. Starting with NATO's
founding father, President Harry S. Truman, each of our presidents has
considered NATO a **vital American interest. President Trump has taken a
dramatically different path.**]{.underline} As former U.S. ambassadors
to NATO, we interviewed alliance leaders past and present for a new
Harvard Belfer Center report: "NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis."
[**Nearly all viewed Trump as NATO's most urgent and difficult problem.
Never before has NATO had a U.S. leader who didn't appear to believe
deeply in NATO itself.** During his first two years in office, **Trump
has questioned NATO's core commitment embedded in Article 5** of the
alliance's founding treaty --- that an attack on one of the allies will
be considered an attack on all. **He has been weak and reactive in
defending NATO against its most aggressive adversary, Russian President
Vladimir Putin. Trump has also been a consistent critic of European
democratic leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while
publicly supporting anti-democratic populists such as Hungarian Prime
Minister Viktor Orban. Trump is the first president to call the European
Union a "foe," rather than a partner, of the United
States.**]{.underline} Fortunately, the vast majority of Republican and
Democratic leaders in Congress disagree with Trump on NATO's value to
the United States. They should vote to approve the bills working their
way through committees that would reaffirm the United States' commitment
to Article 5 and to require congressional approval should Trump try to
diminish our commitment to NATO --- or to pull the United States out
altogether. Congress would be acting in unison with the public's strong
support for NATO, according to a 2018 poll by the Chicago Council on
Global Affairs. Critics who agree with Trump present three main
arguments for why he is right to question NATO. First, they say NATO's
core job was finished with the end of the Cold War. That ignores,
however, Russia's campaign to destabilize NATO members Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland. It also ignores Putin's attacks on the U.S. and
European elections in 2016-2018, designed to weaken our democracies from
within. Containing Russian power until Putin's Soviet-trained generation
passes from the scene remains a core NATO aim. And, as our report shows,
there are new challenges beyond Russia confronting the alliance.
**[Second, Trump has claimed the allies are "taking advantage of
us."]{.underline}** Low European defense spending is indeed a problem
for NATO's future. Germany, in particular, must do much more. But NATO
allies have produced real growth in defense spending for four
consecutive years, starting with Putin's annexation of Crimea --- a
collective increase of \$87 billion. On this issue, Trump would be smart
to continue to push but while doing so strive to transform himself from
chief critic into the unifying leader NATO desperately needs. A third
criticism is that NATO no longer contributes significantly to
U.S. security in the world. Consider the facts: Canada and the European
allies came to our defense on 9/11 and invoked the Article 5
mutual-defense clause of the treaty. They viewed Osama bin Laden's
attack on the United States as an attack on them as well. NATO allies
went into Afghanistan with us where they and partner nations have
suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths. Most of those countries remain
on the ground with our soldiers to this day. NATO allies have also
fought with us in the successful campaign to defeat the Islamic State
caliphate in Syria and Iraq. They conduct counterterror operations with
us in Africa. The European allies have assumed full responsibility for
peacekeeping in Bosnia and the bulk of the burden in Kosovo. U.S. air
and naval bases in allied countries also bring the United States a
continent closer to contain Russia in Eastern Europe and confront
terrorist threats in the Middle East and South Asia. This is a decisive
advantage for the United States. The reality is that NATO is a net plus
for the United States in political, economic and military terms. In the
decade ahead, the United States will fight two battles with
authoritarian powers China and Russia. The first is a battle of ideas
that will center on Moscow's and Beijing's growing confidence in the
superiority of their own systems. We will need the full weight of our
democratic allies in NATO to repudiate the authoritarian model in this
intensifying global debate just as Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald
Reagan did in the past. NATO allies will also be critical in a battle of
technology, as the West competes with a more assertive China in
artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. The United
States has a better chance to maintain its qualitative military edge
over China if we enlist the scientific and productive capacity of all
our allies in Europe as well as in the Indo-Pacific. NATO remains the
great power differential between the United States and Russia and China,
which have no real allies of their own. Trump should reflect on a last
reality that all his predecessors understood. The United States would be
far stronger inside NATO as it faces these challenges than it would be
alone. NATO is not just yesterday's story but is indispensable if
Americans want to reach for the elusive goal we have been chasing since
World War II: a secure United States alongside a united, democratic and
peaceful Europe as its closest global partner.

Although [Congress has expressed consistent bipartisan support for
NATO]{.underline} and its cornerstone Article 5 mutual defense
commitment, [congressional hearings on NATO in the 115th and 116th
Congresses have reflected disagreement on the impact President Trump is
having on the alliance]{.underline}. Some in Congress argue that
President Trump's criticism of allied defense spending levels has
spurred recent defense spending increases by NATO members that were not
forthcoming under prior Administrations despite longstanding U.S.
concern. [They point out that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
has acknowledged that President Trump "is having an impact" in securing
\$41 billion of additional defense spending by European allies and
Canada since 2016. **Others in Congress counter that President Trump's
admonition of U.S. allies and his questioning of NATO's utility has
damaged essential relationships and undermined NATO's credibility and
cohesion. They contend that doubts about the U.S. commitment to NATO
could embolden** adversaries, including **Russia, and ultimately weaken
the commitment of other allies** to the alliance. Some analysts argue
that European allies who feel belittled by the U.S. president might be
less likely to support future NATO operations advocated by the United
States. Critics also tend to downplay President Trump's role in securing
recent defense spending increases by NATO allie]{.underline}s. They
argue that Russian aggression in Europe has been a greater factor behind
rising defense budgets, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.

### 2AC Credibility DA -- Credibility Doesn't Matter 

#### Decades of research prove credibility is false, but maintaining an insolvent Taiwan commitment hurts US allied perception 

**Beinart 18** (Peter Beinart, contributing editor at The Atlantic and a
professor of journalism and political science at the City University of
New York, citing Dartmouth College political scientists Daryl Press and
Jennifer Lin, September 16, 2018. "America Needs an Entirely New Foreign
Policy for the Trump Age."
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/shield-of-the-republic-a-democratic-foreign-policy-for-the-trump-age/570010/)

There are two primary arguments against the Democratic foreign policy
outlined above. [The first involves]{.underline}
**[credibility]{.underline}**. [[If the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[abandons Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the argument
goes]{.underline}, [[it will]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of its
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} to South Korea, the Philippines, and
Japan. Similarly, [if **America**]{.underline} won't fight Russia in
Ukraine, [[neither]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[nor]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[Riga]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[will believe]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[America's promises]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to fight
Russia]{.underline}
in [Latvia](https://www.upi.com/US-Army-tanks-reach-Latvia-Russia-calls-NATO-moves-a-threat/3131486641943/).
During the Vietnam War, [[this logic]{.underline}]{.mark} was dubbed the
"domino theory": If the United States didn't defend Vietnam, its
credibility would collapse and other anti-communist "dominoes" would
soon fall. But [the theory]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Decades of academic
research]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[show that]{.underline}]{.mark}, i[n
the[ words](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/06/red-lines-and-red-herrings/) of
the Dartmouth College political scientists Daryl Press and Jennifer
Lind,]{.underline} "[[there's **little evidence**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[that supports the view that countries']{.underline}]{.mark}
[[**record** for keeping commitments]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[determines
their credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [The]{.underline}
**[Soviets]{.underline}** and West Germans [did]{.underline} **[not
conclude]{.underline}** [that because America would not defend South
Vietnam it would]{.underline} [not defend West Berlin]{.underline},
because they understood that America cared more about West Berlin than
it cared about South Vietnam, and had a greater capacity to defend it.
Similarly, when predicting whether the United States will defend Japan,
neither Beijing nor Tokyo will look at whether America defends Taiwan.
They will look at whether it is in America's interests, and within
America's power, to defend Japan. **[[Far from bolstering a country's
credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[insolvent
commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[drain its
finances]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[overstretch]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[its military]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[undermine its reputation]{.underline}]{.mark}** for sound judgment.
As Kennan[ put
it](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/06/25/mirror_image/),
"There is more respect to be won in the opinion of this world by a
resolute and courageous liquidation of unsound positions than by the
most stubborn pursuit of extravagant or unpromising objectives."

#### Perceptions of US credibility don't spill over and are counterproductive 

**Walt 2015** (Stephen M. Walt, the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University, January 6, 2015. "The
Credibility Addiction."
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:UUohn0SMU10J:foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/06/the-credibility-addiction-us-iraq-afghanistan-unwinnable-war/+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)

Unfortunately, this **[obsession with credibility was
misplaced]{.underline}**. For one thing, [a state's
"**reputation**"]{.underline} [for being tough or reliable]{.underline}
[didn't work the way]{.underline} most foreign-policy [elites thought it
did]{.underline}. [American leaders kept worrying that other states
would question the United States' resolve and capability]{.underline}
[if it ever abandoned an unimportant ally, or lost some minor scrap in
the developing world.]{.underline} But as **[careful
research]{.underline}** by Ted Hopf, Jonathan Mercer, and Daryl Press
[has shown]{.underline}, **[states do not judge the credibility of
commitments in one place by looking at how a country acted somewhere far
away]{.underline}**, [especially when the two situations are quite
different]{.underline}. In fact, when the United States did lose, or
when it chose to cut its losses and liquidate some unpromising position,
[dominos **barely fell**]{.underline} [and its]{.underline}
**[core]{.underline}** strategic **[relations]{.underline}** [remained
**unaffected**]{.underline}. In other words, [how the United States
responds to a challenge in Southeast Asia or sub-Saharan Africa tells
you nothing about how it would or should respond somewhere
else]{.underline}, and other states understood this all along. [When
trying to figure out what the United States is going to do]{.underline},
[other states do not]{.underline} start by [ask]{.underline}ing [what
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[did]{.underline} in some conflict **[on the other side of the
world]{.underline}**. Instead, [they ask whether it is in America's
interest to act in the situation at hand. And guess what? This implies
that U.S. commitments are most credible when the American interest is
obvious to all]{.underline}. I mean, nobody really doubts that the
United States would fight like a tiger to defend its own soil, right?
Exaggerated worries about U.S. credibility had a number of unfortunate
consequences. They encouraged American leaders to act in places that
didn't matter, in order to convince others that it would also act in
places that did. Squandering resources on marginal conflicts undermined
confidence in U.S. protection, however, because it consumed resources
that could have been committed elsewhere and it sometimes made a
war-weary American public even less interested in far-flung foreign
adventures. Ironically, **[misguided efforts to bolster U.S. credibility
may have weakened it]{.underline}** instead. [The **credibility
obsession**]{.underline} also [made it easier for U.S. allies to
**free-ride**]{.underline} (something they were already inclined to do),
[because they could always get Uncle Sucker to take on more burdens by
complaining that they had doubts about American resolve]{.underline}. I
don't blame them for trying this ploy, but I do blame American officials
for falling for it so often. In fact, [had allies been a bit less
confident that the United States was going to protect them]{.underline}
**[no matter what]{.underline}**, these [states might have been willing
to **spend more** on their own defense and been more attentive to
Washington's wishes]{.underline}. [If the goal is retaining U.S.
influence and leverage, **what really matters is whether other states
have confidence in America's judgment**.]{.underline} If they believe
that the United States is good at weighing threats soberly and
rationally, and [if they are convinced that Washington can set clear
priorities and stick to them, then U.S. allies can calibrate their
actions with ours and will be more inclined to follow the U.S.
lead.]{.underline} [If allies and adversaries believe the United States
understands what is going on in key regions and has a clear sense of its
own interests, then they will know that the United States won't be
buffaloed into unwise actions by self-serving allied whining, or
provoked into overreactions by enemies eager to drag us into another
costly quagmire.]{.underline} By contrast, **[if American leaders panic
at every sign of danger]{.underline}** and treat minor problems as
mortal threats, **[then other states will be less inclined to trust
Washington's views]{.underline}** on these matters and be more inclined
to follow their own counsel. When Washington goes to war on the basis of
cooked intelligence, worst-case assumptions, and unsurpassed hubris,
then other countries will be warier the next time we try to get them to
line up alongside us. If the United States keeps throwing soldiers'
lives and billions of dollars into unwinnable conflicts, [confidence in
our political system's ability to make **rational decisions** will
decline even more.]{.underline} [If foreign powers believe U.S. policy
is driven more by domestic politics than by strategic imperatives,
they'll view us with barely veiled contempt and meddle even more in our
porous political system]{.underline}. If foreign leaders pay close
attention to the bluster and balderdash that pass for strategic debate
in official Washington, they'll have reason to wonder if the
self-appointed Leader of the Free World really knows what it is doing.
And of course, when they see a lengthy series of costly screw-ups (Iraq,
Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Ukraine, etc.), they will be more
inclined to think for themselves than to trust Washington's guidance.
What I'm suggesting, in short, is that [successful diplomacy depends
less on endlessly reaffirming our "will" or "resolve," and more on
building confidence in the analytical capacity of the American
foreign-policy community and the judgment]{.underline} of top U.S.
officials. And that's not surprising, either. Diplomacy is mostly about
persuasion; it is ultimately about convincing others to do what we want.
They are more likely to accept our recommendations when we can tell a
truly convincing story, i.e., one that has the merit of being true. And
that means that **[credibility isn't the key to a successful foreign
policy]{.underline}**, especially when it becomes a reflexive tendency
to respond to any and all challenges with threats, bluster, and the use
of force. If America still wants other states to follow our lead, [what
**really matters** is **judgment**]{.underline}: analyzing issues
intelligently, setting clear and sensible priorities, and being willing
to rethink a course of action in response to events. New York Yankees
pitcher Lefty Gomez famously said that it was better to be "lucky than
good." He was probably right, but it's even better to be lucky andsmart.
And both matter more than being mindlessly predictable. Or, to
paraphrase Walt Whitman, a "foolish credibility is the hobgoblin of
small minds."

#### Credibility thesis is wrong - lacks empirical support

**Lanoszka 2015** (Alexander, Stanton Nuclear Security Postdoctoral
Fellow @ MIT, \"The Alliance Politics of Nuclear
Statecraft,\" <http://www.alexlanoszka.com/AlexanderLanoszkaIntro.pdf>)

To be sure, some scholars even dismiss the notion that policy-makers can
manipulate perceptions of credibility. Jonathan Mercer writes that
**[states can never develop a reputation for resolve among their
allies]{.underline}**. [Whatever action they implement that advances the
security interests of another is explained away as rooted in
self-interest rather than on 'being a good ally]{.underline}.'13 In his
study of crisis diplomacy between adversaries, Daryl Press builds on
this skepticism. He argues that [balances of interest and power shape
perceptions of credibility **rather than**]{.underline} past
**[actions]{.underline}**. [It is]{.underline} therefore **[pointless to
pursue policy on the grounds of appearing credible]{.underline}** to
others.14 Not everyone agrees with such assessments of credibility.
Gregory Miller demonstrates how actions can a↵ect credibility and, by
extension, the behavior of allies. However, he relies on evidence drawn
exclusively from before the First World War.15 It is unclear whether and
how credibility matters among allies in the nuclear age. And yet
[pundits and analysts]{.underline} commonly [assume]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to this day
[needs to appear]{.underline} resolved and credible to its allies,
whether in Central Europe or the East China Sea. In light of the
critical literature just mentioned, the validity of these intuitively
appealing arguments is not self-evident. **[We lack an empirical study
that assesses such claims]{.underline}**.

### 2AC Credibility DA -- No Russian Invasion

#### Russia isn't capable of invading the Baltics AND status quo U.S.-Norway cooperation have pre-empted this

**Stangl 5/13** (Maxwell Stangl is a research assistant in the
Department of Military & Strategic Studies at the U.S. Air Force
Academy), "Russia Won\'t Start a (Conventional) War in the Baltics",
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-wont-start-conventional-war-baltics-57317?page=0%2C1

The sound of BM-21 rockets streaking across the sky. The smell of spent
brass and burned powder. The rumble of BTR-82 armored personnel carriers
rolling through a narrow street. Rebels sprinting from building to
building through an open field of fire. These sights do not evoke a
striking imagine of a modern European country, but Russian posturing in
the region might lead to this. After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
international spectators believed this Eurasian military powerhouse
would cease. However, the Russian Federation has returned to its old
Cold War ways, increasing aggressive activities against its neighbors in
an attempt to stymie North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
expansion. As seen with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 or the
liberation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the 2008 Georgian War,
Russia has used its military to destabilize bordering nations. Many
leaders are worried that similar actions could be taken against the
Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Unlike Ukraine, these
three countries are a part of NATO, presenting a prime target for
Russian president Vladimir Putin. However, future aggression will likely
come in the form of the hybrid warfare attacks as seen in Ukraine and
Georgia rather than an all-out invasion like many think. As Catherine
Harris and Frederick Kagan from the Institute for the Study of War have
hinted at, "The Russian military is well-positioned to launch a
conventional war in Ukraine and a hybrid war in the Baltic States, the
opposite of what Western leaders seem to be expecting in each theater."
**[Russia is simply not prepared or properly positioned to execute a
well-coordinated, conventional attack on the Baltics. The amount of
Russian units in close proximity to make a rapid assault is limited, and
most of these formations would take significant time and resources to
mobilize. It would require a large and complex movement of troops,
vehicles, and equipment to successfully plan and execute such an
operation. Such activity would surely catch the eye of NATO members,
alerting them to a likely invasion. Instead, Russian posture is best
suited for hybrid warfare against these neighboring
countries.]{.underline}** A Glimpse of the Bear Report Advertisement
With the Baltic States on Russia's Western border, the Western Military
District (WMD) \[Западный военный округ\] would be ultimately
responsible for Russian military operations in that region. These
districts are similar to the United States geographical combatant
commands such as European Command (EUCOM) and Central Command (CENTCOM),
which have separate units and command structures from multiple branches
across specific regions. Russia's WMD contains all units permanently
present in the western-most part of the country while also including the
enclave of Kaliningrad bordering Poland and Lithuania. Although it is
comprised of naval, air, ground, cyber, electronic, and nuclear
capabilities, the number of assets in the region and their locations
simply do not lend themselves to making a surprise, conventional assault
on the Baltics. For instance, 2017 figures show that there are
twenty-two combat brigades and over 1,200 aircraft within the vicinity
of the Baltics, making it a very capable force. However, these numbers
do not tell the full story. **[Hypothetically, if Russia were to conduct
a combined-arms invasion of the Baltic States tomorrow, only a small
number of forces would be properly positioned to attack.]{.underline}**
There are plenty of armored and mechanized units nearby, however, the
only truly capable and quick reaction military unit available for a
surprise assault would be the 76th Guards Air Assault Division (GAAD).
Based in Pskov only twenty miles from the border of Estonia, they could
utilize cargo aircraft (e.g. Il-76), and helicopters (e.g. Mi-8, Mi-17,
and Mi-24) for airborne operations, striking the Baltics with little
warning. Additionally, it is reported that the GAAD has recent combat
experience in Ukraine. This is an overlooked aspect when talking about
the effectiveness of armed forces. Size and equipment is not the only
thing that determines a unit's effectiveness. Recent tactical combat
experience can also increase lethality, something the GAAD now excels
in. Report Advertisement **[Although speed and experience is great,
especially in a hypothetical Baltic campaign, these air assault units
simply do not have the heavy weaponry, equipment, or logistics to
maintain an offensive posture against NATO combat units. They are
outfitted for quick and rapid deployments rather than sustained fighting
with a superior force such as a U.S. Army Armored Brigade Combat
Team.]{.underline}** To counter this, Russia would have to mobilize
their armored and mechanized forces, turning the conflict into an even
bigger conventional conflict, something Putin knows would not fare well
against American/NATO airpower. Instead, a more predictable, logical,
and less risky approach Russia might take would be utilizing hybrid
warfare tactics like they did against Ukraine in the Crimea and the
Donetsk region. By encouraging the ethnic Russian speaking populations
within the three Baltic countries to side with Russia, Putin could
supply these break off enclaves with weapons and equipment to sustain a
secessionist insurgency, like he did during the Russian invasion of
Georgia in 2008. If necessary, the GAAD could provide very small, but
direct support in a feigned attempt to protect these ethnic Russians, as
Russia did in the 2008 Georgian War. With their expeditionary capability
to deliver rapid firepower in proximity of the Baltics, the GAAD would
be perfectly positioned for this type of deployment. This form of
warfighting would undermine the stability and capability of a NATO
country and possibly the viability of the alliance in the long-term;
precisely what Putin seeks. So NATO is doomed in Eastern Europe? Not
quite Direct or indirect military confrontations are not the only way
Russia could influence or undermine the Baltic States. Methods such as
political, cyber, information, and economic warfare have all been
increasingly utilized by Russia in the twenty-first century. They are
the main components of hybrid warfare. Russia could easily employ them
with maximum effort to degrade and/or disable the political and military
capabilities of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania---or any other neighboring
country for that matter. By launching cyber-attacks, shutting down oil
pipelines, or creating at least the illusion of a contested election,
Russia can impart permanent and crippling impacts in the Baltics without
even firing a shot. They would not need large troop formations or
armored brigades, only keyboard warriors with their fingers at the
ready. It could come at any time and without warning. The nature of
these warfare methods presents their own set of problems for the West.
If tanks start rolling across the border, it is an obvious attack on a
NATO country, requiring Article 5 to be invoked in order to provide
collective defense. However, should we view these hybrid warfare tactics
the same way, especially with some in the Trump administration
questioning the value of the alliance? Confusion through hybrid warfare
is precisely what Putin wants to achieve. Their chances of success are
higher than what most Western leaders are willing to admit. Russia's
options are certainly plentiful and effective, however that is not to
say the United States and NATO do not have ways to counter them. NATO
currently has an Enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, and Poland, consisting of battle groups of roughly a
battalion worth of troops and vehicles from multiple different nations.
These units are the first line of defense against any Russian incursion,
however, due to their small size, they are really only effective at
minor deterrence. They would essentially act as a 'holding force' in
slowing a Russian advance for no more than three days until U.S.-NATO
reinforcements could arrive. On top of these battlegroups, U.S. Marine
Corps Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF) would be the perfect unit to
rapidly respond with. Although the name may be misleading, the Special
Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force -- Crisis Response -- Africa
(SPMAGTF-CR-AF) operates in Europe as well. It is designed as a Marine
Expeditionary Unit (MEU) stationed ashore, consisting of approximately
2,200 marines utilizing dismounted infantry, armored vehicles, and
aircraft. Additionally, due to recent Russian aggression, Marine
Rotational Force -- Europe (MRF-E) has also been stood up to be
stationed in nearby Norway. These two units would be able to quickly
support Baltic States in a limited, sudden conflict. With the
possibility of Poland hosting "Fort Trump," this would provide yet
another element of American firepower in the region. Report
Advertisement **[With forces even as small and light as these, supply is
still a serious concern. To combat this, the U.S. and Norway have worked
together to create the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program - Norway
(MCPP-N). This program consists of six cave sites and two airfields
within Norway that house equipment and supplies necessary for the two
U.S. Marine Corps units. This reduces their crisis response time as
equipment is readily available to deploy near the battlespace. The
extended logistical support of the MCPP-N also allows these units to
sustain a fight with a sizable store of supplies.]{.underline}** Step
One to Deterring the Russian Bear: Realizing and Accepting Even with
NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence and two rapid reaction U.S. Marine
Corps units near the Baltic region, they might actually be very
ineffective. If defending against a large Russian mechanized assault,
their small numbers would be hopeless---unless U.S. airpower could
respond rapidly enough. If attacked through dynamic unconventional
hybrid warfare tactics, most are too heavily geared and trained towards
a conventional battlefield to effectively counter such a situation. The
SPMAGTF-CR-AF is arguably the only unit prepared for such operations. To
be blunt, U.S. and NATO units in the region are poorly prepared for both
possible scenarios that Russia could thrust upon the Baltics. Western
military planners need to reorganize and align units in such a way that
they can handle Russian hybrid warfare, while preparing for a
conventional attack as a secondary measure. This is a problem that NATO
military planners fail to see. **[Russia will not risk a full
conventional operation against even the smallest of NATO
countries.]{.underline}** Instead, Russia will rely on fighting the West
along blurred lines of war and peace, something that Western militaries
are struggling to adapt to. Putin wants to put pressure on Europe to
show that his country is still a world power; he would gain very little
material good from annexing the Baltics. Russian leaders want to make
NATO appear weak, while simultaneously avoiding a full out war. Putin
sees value in destabilizing neighboring countries that want to leave
their sphere of control by aligning with the U.S. and NATO. Western
leaders must come to the realization that the possibility of hybrid
warfare by Russia in the Baltics is very plausible -- and winnable for
Putin without the proper countermeasures in-place.

### 2AC Credibility DA -- No Impact 

#### No risk of Russia war

Andrei **Tsygankov 16**, Professor at the Departments of Political
Science and International Relations at San Francisco State University,
PhD from USC, "5 reasons why the threat of a global war involving Russia
is overstated," Feb 19 2016,
http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/5-reasons-why-threat-great-power-war-involving-russia-overstated

The contemporary discussion of security interactions among major powers
is depressing to participants and observers alike. [Experts and
politicians are warning]{.underline} us [of]{.underline} an increasingly
[**high likelihood of a military conflict -- possibly** a **nuclear**
one -- between Russia]{.underline}, on the one hand, [and the U.S. or
NATO]{.underline}, on the other.¶ [In the West, many argue the dangers
associated with a "resurgent" Russia and]{.underline} vow to defend
themselves from Russian President Vladimir Putin's "aggressive" actions
in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Last month, U.S. Defense
Secretary Ash Carter accused Russia of threatening the world order and
starkly warned: "Make no mistake, the United States will defend our
interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the
positive future it affords us all."¶ The [tensions have been
growing]{.underline} and have become especially high [since
the]{.underline} 2014 [Ukraine crisis]{.underline}. Russian military
flights over the Baltic and Black Sea in response to NATO's active
buildup on Russia's European borders has done little to calm these
fears. The Turkish decision to shoot down a Russian warplane by claiming
violation of its airspace in November 2015 revived the discussion of
Moscow's [possible military conflict with Istanbul and]{.underline}
NATO, of which Turkey is a member. More recently, the hype has been over
the Kremlin's [**alleged preparations to invade** the Baltic
States]{.underline} and the West's need to respond.¶ In Russia, these
threats and discussions are taken seriously, and the responsibility for
these security tensions has been squarely placed on the Western powers.
The frequently repeated charges are that the West and NATO have
encircled Russia with military bases and refused to recognize Moscow's
global interests. Russian media have actively discussed the U.S.
National Security Archive's Cold War documents on a nuclear attack
against Russia and China declassified on Dec. 22, 2015.¶ Last week,
while attending the Munich Security Conference, Prime Minister Dmitry
Medvedev compared the contemporary security environment with the one
that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis and reminded the audience of U.S.
President John F. Kennedy's words that "foreign policy can kill us.\"¶
In the meantime, contradicting Medvedev, Russian experts often bemoan
the fact that the Cold War was far more predictable and less dangerous
than today's multipolar world. What many have initially viewed as a
generally positive transition from the U.S. "diktat" is now presented as
leading toward a great power war.¶ This increasingly apocalyptic mood on
both sides reflects a growing international instability and breakdown of
important communication channels between Russia and the West. Since the
beginning of Ukraine crisis and up until the G20 meeting in Antalya in
December 2015, the two sides have barely interacted. Appalled by
Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for Ukrainian separatists,
Western leaders pursued policies of sanctions and isolation, whereas the
indignant Kremlin has sought to demonstrate its indifference toward such
policies.¶ Only since Antalya have Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama
resumed their attempts to regularly discuss issues of importance.
Western and Russia military, too, severed their contacts although the
two sides have recently begun to coordinate their actions in the Syrian
airspace. The aforementioned [[alarmist views]{.mark} and arguments [are
**misplaced**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[because]{.mark} they underestimate
[the dangers]{.mark} of the Cold War and **[overestimate those of
today's world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶ Despite some attempts to present
the Cold War as generally stable, predictable, and peaceful, this is not
the time to feel nostalgic about it. Multiple crises from Berlin to Cuba
and Afghanistan extended across much of the Cold War era. State
propaganda on both sides was reinforced by an intense ideological
confrontation accompanied by drills and necessary preparations for a
nuclear war.¶ The Oscar-nominated film "Bridge of Spies" directed by
Steven Spielberg reproduces some of that hysterical atmosphere in the
United States where the public was mobilized for any actions in support
of the government. In the Soviet Union it was no different. For the
world outside the West and the U.S.S.R., this was not a peaceful, but
rather an increasingly chaotic and violent time -- the conclusion well
documented by scholars of the Third World.¶ Why today\'s world is less
dangerous than the Cold War¶ Today's world, while threatening and
uncertain, is hardly more dangerous than the Cold War, for the following
reasons.¶ First, [whatever the rhetoric, major powers are not inclined
towards risky behavior when their core interests are at stake. This
concerns not only the nuclear superpowers, but also]{.underline}
countries such as [Turkey. The prospect of confronting
Russia\'s]{.underline} overwhelmingly superior [military should give
pause even to]{.underline} someone as hot-tempered as Turkish President
Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline}. Even if Erdogan wanted to pit Russia
against NATO, it wouldn't work.¶ So far, [[NATO has been **careful to
not be drawn in**]{.mark}**to highly provocative actions**,
whether]{.underline} it is by [responding to Russia seizing the
Pristina]{.underline} International [Airport in June 1999, getting
involved on Georgia's side]{.underline} during the military conflict in
August 2008 [or]{.underline} by [providing]{.underline} lethal military
assistance and [support for Ukraine. Unless Russia is the clear and
proven aggressor, NATO is unlikely to]{.underline} support Turkey and
[**begin World War III**.]{.underline}¶ Second, [[Russia **remains a
defensive power**]{.underline} [aware of]{.underline} ]{.mark}[its
[responsibility for]{.mark} maintaining international
[stability]{.mark}. Moscow wants to work with major powers, not against
them]{.underline}. Its insistence on Western recognition of Russia's
interests must not be construed as a drive to destroy the foundations of
the international order, such as sovereignty, multilateralism, and arms
control.¶ Third, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has]{.mark} important [interests
to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[prevent regional conflicts from
escalating]{.underline} or becoming trans-regional. Although its
relative military capabilities are not where they were ten years ago,
the [U.S. military and diplomatic resources are sufficient
to]{.underline} **[[restrain]{.mark} key [regional
players]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}in any part of the world. Given
the power rivalry across several regions, [proxy wars are]{.underline}
possible and indeed are [happening, but they are **unlikely to
escalate**]{.underline}.¶ Fourth, unlike the Cold War era, the
contemporary world has no rigid alliance structure. The so-called
Russia-China-Iran axis is hardly more than a figment of the imagination
by American neoconservatives and some Russia conspiracy-minded thinkers.
The world remains a space in which international coalitions overlap and
are mostly formed on an ad hoc basis.¶ Fifth, with the exception of the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Greater Syria (ISIS), there is no
fundamental conflict of values and ideologies. Despite the efforts to
present as incompatible the so-called "traditional" and "Western" values
by Russia or "democracy" to "autocracy" by the United States and Europe,
the world majority does not think that this cultural divide is worth
fighting for.¶ [Despite the dangers]{.underline} of [[the
world]{.underline}]{.mark} we live in, it [[contains]{.mark} a number of
important]{.underline}, even [[**underappreciated**,
checks]{.underline}]{.mark} on great powers' militarism. The [[threat
talk]{.underline}]{.mark} coming from politicians is often deceiving.
Such talk [[may be a way to **pressure the opponent**]{.mark}
into]{.underline} various political and military [concessions rather
than to signal real intentions. When such pressures do not bring
expected results]{.underline}, the [rhetoric of war]{.underline} and
isolation [subsides]{.underline}.¶ **[Then a [dialogue
begins]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Perhaps, the [**increasing** frequency of
**[exchanges between Obama and Putin]{.mark}**]{.underline} since
December 2015 - [including]{.underline} their recent [phone conversation
following the Munich conference -]{.underline}
[[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} a growing [[recognition]{.mark} that the
record of pressuring]{.underline} Russia [has been mixed at
best.]{.underline}

#### No Russia war

[As for Russia's own intentions, two things are clear. [There is **no
interest** in Moscow in attacking the Baltic states]{.mark} or
Poland]{.underline}. These countries are as safe now as they were before
2014. Suggestions otherwise simply point to the deep wounds in both
nations' psyche, which will not be healed for many decades.

Should Ukraine's leaders decide to repeat Mikheil Saakashvili's mistake
in 2008 and launch a major offensive to retake Donbas --- however
unlikely --- the Russian response could indeed be devastating and lead
to Ukraine's loss of sovereignty, as Putin recently stated. But [does
this mean Russia will move on Ukraine unprovoked? **Most certainly
not.**]{.underline}

[[Putin's main concerns are]{.mark} largely [domestic. He has an
ambitious program]{.mark} that logically calls [for]{.mark} more
[economic ties with the West]{.mark}. To move forward, he is looking [to
**ease tensions with the EU and the U.S**.]{.mark} What Putin wanted to
get out of Helsinki was mainly to **start a dialogue** with
Washington.]{.underline}

Those hopes are now visibly going up in smoke. It is safe to bet that
Russia will continue to face the same opposition from a coalition of
U.S. and EU interests.

The first détente in the hybrid war between Russia and the West was
indeed nipped in the bud by Trump's behavior and the vehemence of his
domestic critics. So be it.

[[Moscow will]{.mark} not capitulate]{.underline}, and will indeed
[[push back]{.mark}. But it's **[not]{.mark} likely** to take the [form
of a]{.mark}n aggressive, overt [military attack. Fears of new wars are
**far from accurate**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[but]{.mark} neither of these [**actions** are]{.mark} guaranteed to be

**automatically [trigger the tripwire]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that would

probably **[[won't happen]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the so-called
"deconfliction mechanisms" will be relied upon **instead**]{.underline}
[to prevent this "dark scenario" from materializing.]{.underline} By the
same token, [Russia knows that shooting down the US missiles will
**enrage Trump**]{.underline} [and prompt]{.underline} his "deep state"
to push [him into escalating the crisis even further in order to avoid
"embarrassment",]{.underline} which is one argument as to why it might
not militarily respond to this predictably forthcoming assault apart
from the fact that it [officially
declared](https://sputniknews.com/politics/201704101052503997-russia-unlikely-counter-us-strikes/)
last year after the first one happened that it wouldn't do if any new
ones happened either. That said, [the Russian
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} on this matter [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}
gotten to such a point -- and **[[been]{.mark} so [widely
misinterpreted]{.mark} by many]{.underline}** -- [that there are very
real expectations around the world for it to respond]{.underline} in one
form or another otherwise it will be "humiliated" and considered
"unreliable", and this soft power-"constructivist" impression might
actually end up influencing policy at the end of the day. However, **[it
doesn't mean]{.underline}** [that Russia will intercept Trump and his
allies' cruise missiles with S-400 ones]{.underline} [but just that it
could react through diplomatic or economic means]{.underline} like
Russian State Duma Defense Committee Chairman and former
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Airborne Troops Vladimir Shamanov
warned earlier this week. Russia is also in a predicament when it comes
to its possible response because anything less than a 100% success rate
with the S-400s might diminish their hard-earned international
reputation as the world's best anti-air and anti-missile defensive
weapons system, something that Moscow might not be willing to risk when
considering that billions upon billions of dollars of future revenue is
dependent on their sales, which become even more important in the
context of existing sanctions. [Because of the dangerous escalatory risk
that could occur if Russia's S-400s]{.underline} [take down all of
Trump]{.underline} and his allies' incoming [munitions]{.underline}
(something that Moscow said last year it wouldn't do anyway), **[as well
as the need to avoid any unexpected "flukes"]{.underline}** [that could
result in **anything less than a 100%**]{.underline} [or other similarly
"convincing" showing of this defensive system's first-ever battle-tested
capabilities]{.underline}, **[[Russia is unlikely to militarily respond
to the US]{.mark} in any "significant" way. Nor]{.underline}**, for that
matter, **[is the US]{.underline}** [expected to "significantly" change
the balance of power]{.underline} in Syria [through its supposedly
imminent and potentially multilateral strike against the Arab
Republic]{.underline}, [meaning that both the US' actions and Russia's
reaction will probably be "**superficial**"]{.underline} [in order for
both sides to "**save face"**]{.underline} [and not risk having the
other "embarrass" them by upstaging their real military capabilities.
Russia's 100% deflection]{.underline} of the US and its allies' best
missiles [would prove that the S-400 is the most effective
system]{.underline} for preventing American-led aggression against any
country in the world; conversely, **[anything less than that or
similarly "unconvincing"]{.underline}** (and brought about by some kind
of unexpected and unusual occurrence) [would make the world think
whether rightly or wrongly that the S-400 **doesn't live up to its
"hype"** and is incapable of "saving" its customers.
Therefore]{.underline}, **[as paradoxical as it may
sound]{.underline}**, [[the]{.mark} US-Russian
[standoff]{.mark}]{.underline} in Syria **[[might]{.mark} actually [be
"stably" managed]{.mark}]{.underline}** (key word, used relatively)
**[precisely because]{.underline}** [of the military competition between
these parties' offensive and defensive weapons
respectively]{.underline}, [with each of them knowing full well that
**anything other than an "ideal" performance** by either of
them]{.underline} -- [which is **impossible for both sides to pull
off**]{.underline} given that they'd be challenging one another --

a speech in January. Xi spoke of "peaceful reunification" with Taiwan,
but he warned, "We do not forsake the use of force." Ever since Hong
Kong and Macau rejoined Mainland China in 1997 and 1999, respectively,
Chinese expectations that Taiwan would follow suit have grown. When, a
decade ago, the Beijing Olympics and the global financial crisis boosted
China's confidence on the world stage, those expectations redoubled. But
"peaceful reunification" has proved elusive. After Taiwan elected Tsai
Ing-wen, of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), to
the presidency in 2016, many Mainland Chinese lost patience with the
idea. Some Chinese nationalists now argue that China has only a brief
window of opportunity to seize Taiwan. Talk of "forceful reunification"
is ascendant. Stay informed. In-depth analysis delivered weekly. [SIGN

China has already begun to tighten the noose. It has forced Taiwan out
of international bodies, such as the World Health Organization; required
airlines to replace "Taiwan" with descriptions such as "Taiwan, Province
of China"; and induced five more countries to sever relations with
Taipei. **Beijing seems to believe that the United States will sit by as
it squeezes Taiwan.** Taipei, meanwhile, has convinced itself that China
has no plans to invade. And U.S. President Donald Trump seems to think
he can rock the boat without consequences. All are wrong---and their
wishful thinking is raising the odds of conflict. "CHINA DREAM" IN
BEIJING Now that Xi has consolidated power, he seeks a legacy befitting
the great emperors of old: the reunification of the Middle Kingdom. "The
only thing that will make him the greatest leader in the Chinese
Communist Party's history is to take Taiwan back," Shen Dingli, a
foreign relations scholar at Fudan University, [told
Quartz](https://qz.com/1218961/what-xi-jinping-wants-to-do-with-his-unrivalled-power/)
in 2018. "If he were to achieve China's reunification, who will say he
is second to Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping?\" **[There are signs that Xi
believes the world will sit by if China invades Taiwan.]{.underline}**
Xi, whose "China Dream" promises to make China great again, likely
agrees. "Fight a war, win a war," is one of his signature slogans. In
2017, he presided over a military parade with a replica of Taiwan's
presidential palace visible in the distance. Chinese soldiers had
constructed it to train for an invasion of Taiwan. That same year,
China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, circumnavigated Taiwan
twice. "The PLA is likely preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan
with China by force," the U.S. Defense Department [told
Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/16/2001955282/-1/-1/1/2018-CHINA-MILITARY-POWER-REPORT.PDF)
in 2018. There are signs that Xi believes the world will sit by if China
invades Taiwan. "Xi has told people that he was impressed by Putin's
seizure of Crimea," a Beijing insider
[told](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red) the
reporter Evan Osnos in 2015. "\[Putin\] got a large piece of land and
resources" and met little resistance from the West. Many among China's
elite have embraced military action. "The possibility for peaceful
reunification is gradually dissipating," Wang Zaixi, a former deputy
director of the PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office,
[declared](http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/thwl/2016-12/9985848.html) in 2017.
"There will very likely be military conflict," retired Chinese General
Wang Hongguang [told the People's
Daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kkNf1e5NGY) in December. Many
ordinary Chinese agree. "If we want to take our island back, we have to
use force." reads a Weibo
[post](https://www.weibo.com/1974576991/H4gYticya?type=comment) from
last November. Both Chinese academics and journalists argue that this
sentiment is widespread. "Mainland Chinese public opinion became
impatient with Taiwan a long time ago," former director of the Chinese
Academy of Social Science's Institute of Taiwan Studies Zhou Zhihuai
[wrote](http://opinion.huanqiu.com/1152/2017-05/10688708.html) in 2017.
"Mainland Chinese will be very happy to see the PLA take action to
punish a 'pro-independence Taiwan'," a Global Times editorial
[claimed](http://opinion.huanqiu.com/editorial/2018-01/11487805.html) in
2018. WISHFUL THINKING IN TAIPEI Despite this increased militancy across
the Strait, Taipei has convinced itself that China will not attack. Many
in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have persuaded themselves
that China is too sensible to take military action. "The mainland
Chinese leader today is a rational decision maker," Tsai
[claimed](https://www.dw.com/zh/%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%BA%94%E4%B8%8D%E4%BC%9A%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E5%8A%A8%E6%AD%A6/a-41974800)
in 2017: Xi would not provoke a war likely to drag in Japan and the
United States. Others in the DPP depict China as too weak. "China has
too many domestic problems" to capture Taiwan, professor Fan Shih-Ping
[wrote](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20171006/1026340.htm)in 2017.
Taiwan's major opposition party, the Kuomintang, takes a rosy view of
Beijing that rejects the idea that China might invade. "There is no
problem," former president Ma Ying-jeou
[declared](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20180124/1099500.htm) last year.
"Nowadays Beijing's top strategy is peaceful rise," the journalist Huang
Nian [wrote](https://udn.com/news/story/11321/3087200) in April.
"Forceful reunification would derail it." This complacency has led
Taiwan to neglect its armed forces. Taiwan's military suffers from a
desperate shortage of officers---nearly half of all lieutenant positions
are
[unfilled](https://cybsbox.cy.gov.tw/CYBSBoxSSL/edoc/download/24967). In
2018, Taiwan made matters worse. Just as talk of "forceful
reunification" was rising in Mainland China, the government
[ended](https://cybsbox.cy.gov.tw/CYBSBoxSSL/edoc/download/24967)
compulsory military enlistment---but
[allowed](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/focus/paper/1172558) felons to
serve. Morale has plummeted. The United States has recommended that
Taiwan consider restoring conscription. "The shift to a voluntary
military was a mistake," U.S. officials
[concluded](https://cybsbox.cy.gov.tw/CYBSBoxSSL/edoc/download/24967).
In an [April 2018 poll](https://www.storm.mg/article/428123), more than
40 percent of Taiwanese said they had "no confidence at all" that their
military could defend Taiwan; but 65 percent had convinced themselves
that the PRC would not take military action against the island; and only
six percent believed that an attack was "very likely." "AMERICA FIRST"
IN WASHINGTON The withering of Taiwan's armed forces has increased
Taiwan's military reliance on the United States---just when many in
Beijing are questioning the U.S. commitment to Taiwan. Trump's "America
first" doctrine has convinced many Chinese that the United States is now
too isolationist to come to Taiwan's defense. "America will absolutely
sacrifice Taiwan," the Global Times
[insisted](http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/article/2017-01/9999421.html) in
2017. "On the premise of America First ... the United States is not
likely to send troops to fight for Taiwan." For decades, a U.S. policy
of "dual deterrence" has helped prevent conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
**[Washington has warned Beijing not to attack Taiwan unprovoked, but
reassured Chinese leaders that the United States would not support
Taiwanese independence. It]{.underline}** has told Taipei, in turn, that
the United States would come to its defense---as long as it did not
provoke Beijing by declaring independence. Making the policy work has
meant treading a fine line, but for decades, dual deterrence has allowed
Taiwan to enjoy de facto independence and helped prevent a war with
China. Trump has upset that delicate balance. In December 2016, Tsai
called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. The incoming Trump
administration then began to talk of "revisiting" the One China policy,
under which the United States recognizes the People's Republic of China
as the sole legal government of China, but maintains unofficial
relations with Taiwan. Beijing was outraged. Xi refused to talk to Trump
until he recommitted the United States to the One China policy. In
February, Trump capitulated. In a phone call with Xi, he affirmed that
the United States would continue to support the "One China" policy.
"Trump lost his first fight with Xi," the Beijing scholar Shi Yinhong
[bragged](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/world/asia/trump-one-china-taiwan.html)
to the New York Times. "He will be looked at as a paper tiger." Last
year, however, the pendulum swung back toward confrontation. In
February, Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act, encouraging (but not
requiring) high-level U.S. officials to visit Taiwan, and high-level
Taiwanese officials to visit the United States. In the fall, Trump
started a trade war with China, generating anxiety among Chinese
nationalists. They now believe Trump is using Taiwan as part of a new
Cold War against China, creating a sense of urgency for reunification. A
WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY China could well move to take Taiwan before 2020,
when some Chinese fear that Taiwan's presidential election will close
Beijing's window of opportunity for military action. Many Mainland
Chinese nationalists were disappointed, rather than relieved, by the
pro-independence DPP's poor showing in last November's local Taiwanese
elections. This counterintuitive reaction reveals an alarming calculus:
should a weakened Tsai and the DPP lose the presidency in 2020 to a more
pro-China candidate, the opportunity for "forceful reunification" would
be lost. "What a pity," one Weibo user from Beijing
[wrote](https://www.weibo.com/1974576991/H4gYticya?type=comment) about
the DPP's losses. "We could be further away from the day of
reunification." It is the hated DPP that gives Chinese nationalists a
pretext to take Taiwan back now. That disappointment has fed a sense of
urgency among many Chinese nationalists. "I request that Mainland China
issue a timetable for reunification," one outraged Weibo user
[wrote](https://www.weibo.com/1974576991/H4gYticya?type=comment) in
November. "Whether peaceful or forceful, please don't drag this out
again and again." The 2020 U.S. presidential election also looms in the
minds of Chinese nationalists. Trump looks less likely to win reelection
after Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms, and many Chinese worry
that a Trump loss would make forceful reunification harder. **[Trump is
seen as a businessman and isolationist willing to bargain Taiwan away.
"America will sell Taiwan out in the blink of an eye,"]{.underline}** a
People's Daily [editorial
claimed](http://opinion.haiwainet.cn/n/2018/0322/c456465-31284500.html)
last year. (Few Chinese recognize the possibility that Trump might
respond forcefully to an attack on Taiwan to rally support at home.) A
Trump successor, "forceful reunification" advocates fear, may not be so
willing to cut a deal. Some in Beijing even think China can retake
Taiwan without violence. China may "break the enemy's resistance without
fighting," Wang Zaixi
[told](http://sc.people.com.cn/n2/2017/0105/c345527-29554902.html) the
Global Times in 2017. Just as the Communist Party seized Beijing in 1949
without shooting a single bullet, he argued, China could capture Taiwan
peacefully by surrounding the island, imposing economic sanctions, and
cutting off its oil supply. "No need to shed blood," he concluded. The
idea that China can force reunification without fighting is delusional
and dangerous. Tightening the military or economic noose around Taiwan
would likely provoke a reaction from the United States. Given popular
nationalist pressures, Beijing would then feel compelled to respond.
Things could get out of control fast. All sides need to wake up to the
dangers of backing into a conflict that few want.

### 2AC Taiwan Prolif DA -- No Prolif 

#### Taiwan won't proliferate -- proliferation risks economic and sovereignty gains 

**Kassenova 12** (Togzhan Kassenova has a PhD in politics from the
University of Leeds and specializes in nuclear politics and WMD
nonproliferation research. "Global Non-Proliferation and the Taiwan
Dilemma". March 22, 2012
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/22/global-non-proliferation-and-taiwan-dilemma-pub-47675>)

[Since Taiwan is outside of the global non-proliferation
regime]{.underline}, Taipei's unilateral policies, motivations and
actions in the non-proliferation field are paramount. [There are several
key drivers that influence Taiwan's choices in this regard. First, while
**the international community cannot technically hold Taiwan accountable
to** the **treaties and regimes to which it is not party**, it does
expect and pressure Taiwan to adhere to globally accepted
non-proliferation norms.]{.underline} The United States, for example,
has played a major role in the trajectory of Taiwan's nuclear policy.
The [US government heavily influenced Taiwan's decision to abandon a
nuclear weapons program that it attempted to begin twice, in
the]{.underline} [1950s and]{.underline} the 19[80s]{.underline}. The US
has also encouraged and assisted Taiwan with developing its strategic
trade control
system.[8](https://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/22/global-non-proliferation-and-taiwan-dilemma-pub-47675#8)
Another dimension of Taiwan's non-proliferation policy is
economics-driven. [Taipei realizes that its **trade in high-tech
dual-use goods depends heavily on whether it is perceived as a reliable
actor.**]{.underline} Legislation of some of Taiwan's key trade partners
--- the US and Japan --- specifically addresses the question of a
state's non-proliferation record. US legislation makes it difficult and
on occasion impossible for US companies to engage in trade with actors
with a poor non- proliferation
record.[9](https://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/22/global-non-proliferation-and-taiwan-dilemma-pub-47675#9)
Japanese strategic trade-control legislation imposes varying levels of
export-control requirements depending on security concerns and the
stringency of the importing country's export control
system.[10](https://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/22/global-non-proliferation-and-taiwan-dilemma-pub-47675#10)
Finally, [**Taiwan's non-proliferation policy is driven by its desire to
be a part of the international community**. While being formally outside
all international arrangements that require statehood, Taiwan aims to
adhere to global non-proliferation norms. Most noticeably, Taiwan's
non-proliferation policy manifests itself in the strategic trade control
system.]{.underline} Despite not being a member of any multilateral
export control regimes, Taiwan chose to incorporate items controlled by
all four MECRs in its national control list. In essence, [Taiwan
**voluntarily adheres to rules**]{.underline} guiding trade in dual-use
goods and technologies. The Taiwanese government requires traders to
seek an export-import license before engaging in transactions that
involve items listed on Taiwan's national control list. More
importantly, [Taiwanese **legislation established a** "catch-all"
**provision that requires traders to apply for an export-import license
for items that do not appear on the national control list** but might be
used for WMD purposes. This allows the government to throw an even wider
net over products that might lead to proliferation]{.underline}. In
another gesture demonstrating Taiwan's desire to follow international
norms, [Taipei established stricter non-proliferation controls with
regards to North Korea and Iran]{.underline}. Taipei developed a
"Sensitive Commodity List" that includes a number of items that are
controlled by the government if destined for these two countries.

#### Taiwan has no capability or motive to go nuclear -- long timeframe for impact

Practical Obstacles [Several factors contribute to the absence of a
nuclear debate in Taiwan. The foremost involves capability]{.underline}.
Although Taiwan is often described as having the requisite technology to
develop nuclear weapons, [[the country lacks the industrial capability
and associated military infrastructure to field a credible nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}. Taipei faces practical obstacles. For
instance, [the island lacks fissile materials]{.underline}. Taiwan's
heavy water nuclear reactor that can enrich plutonium, which was located
at the Institute for Nuclear Energy Research, has been dismantled. The
Institute for Nuclear Energy Research itself has been downgraded to
become a division of the civilian Atomic Energy Council of the executive
branch, and its mission has been redirected toward commercial energy
production. Experienced research staff also have left or retired. Waste
fuel rods stored at Taipower Company, which are under the International
Atomic Energy Agency's safeguard system, also are not available for use
in a weapons program. 13 [Even if Taiwan managed to assemble a bomb, [it
lacks test facilities]{.mark} needed for systems integration or a
full-scale test]{.underline}. Taiwan has no place to test a nuclear
weapon, and it is impossible to test clandestinely. Simulated tests
using super computers are possible; however, [[Taiwan has no relevant
database]{.mark} to gauge designs]{.underline} tested in this way. [Many
observers have described these obstacles]{.underline}. Chien Chung, a
nuclear chemistry expert teaching at Taiwan's National Tsing Hua
University, notes that [although many research facilities exist on the
island, today's [researchers lack practical experience when it comes to
designing and manufacturing nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
noted that **[[it would take several billion U.S.
dollars]{.underline}]{.mark}** to "re-build the nuclear weapons program"
given its complete disarray. 14 Another observer who is familiar with
Taiwan's nuclear program also suggested that [**[it would take eight to
ten years]{.mark}** to rebuild basic scientific and industrial capacity
[before any nuclear development program could be
undertaken]{.mark}]{.underline}. 15 Political Obstacles [Any effort to
start a nuclear program also would encounter domestic political
opposition. [There is a strong antinuclear movement in
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} that keeps close contact with the global
antinuclear movement. This opposition is also reflected in the DPP's
nuclear-free homeland Taiwan program, which was endorsed in May 2003
with a pledge not to develop nuclear weapons. 16 [Combined with highly
competitive media]{.underline}, which closely watch sensational
stories**[, [it would probably be impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
rebuild the nuclear weapons program secretly. [Most Taiwanese believe
that reviving the nuclear option is highly risky, with the likely costs
far outweighing any potential gains. [U.S. policy]{.mark} on weapons of
mass destruction also [is likely to deter any effort]{.mark} to launch a
nuclear program]{.underline} on the island. U.S. nonproliferation and
counterproliferation policy, combined with Taiwan's security dependence
on Washington, would dissuade potential nuclear advocates. They know
that it is counterproductive for Taiwan to advocate a nuclear option,
especially in the context of an improving U.S.-China relationship. 17
[Taipei also understands that [a nuclear program would tarnish its
international image, **which would hurt ongoing efforts to**]{.mark}
**gain international support and sympathy.**]{.underline}

#### No chance for Taiwan prolif 

**NTI 15** (Nuclear Threat Initiative, international arms control and
non-proliferation organization, "Taiwan", 2015,
http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/taiwan/)

[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} possesses much of the technological
expertise necessary to develop nuclear weapons, but [[would face
significant obstacles]{.underline}]{.mark} in doing so---namely,
[[**U.S. opposition**, **international pressure**, and the threat of a
**pre-emptive strike by China**. Recent assessments indicate]{.mark}
that [it would take Taiwan between one and eight years to develop a
complete]{.mark} nuclear [warhead, and]{.mark}]{.underline} most likely
[[**much longer** to design one]{.mark} light enough [to be carried by
any]{.mark} of Taiwan\'s current land-attack
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}. Regardless, [most analysts
agree]{.underline} that under the current political situation, [Taiwan
is **very unlikely** to pursue a nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline}. \[38\]

#### No Japan Prolif 

**Kulacki**, China Project Manager in the UCS Global Security Program,
**'15** (Gregory, "Japan Calls for United States to End Hair-Trigger
Alert," April, Union of Concerned Scientists) But our interviews with
U.S. and Japanese participants in the EDD confirmed that that did not
happen. **[The EDD does not focus on nuclear deterrence but on
deterrence in general]{.underline}**. A senior U.S. Department of
Defense official involved in the talks told us that the United States
tries to downplay the role of nuclear issues in the EDD. That means that
today's U.S.-Japanese dialogue on extended deterrence follows in the
footsteps of the one led by Wolfowitz on the INF Treaty 30 years
earlier. Now, **[as then, [the U.S. gov-ernment continues to affirm that
the credibility of the U.S. defense commitment to Japan does not depend
on U.S. nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Why Japan Is Not a
Proliferation Risk [The most difficult question]{.underline} confronting
outside ob-servers today [is whether the contradiction between Japanese
government support]{.underline} for nuclear disarmament [and the
pro-nuclear preferences of some Japa-nese officials reflects U.S.
pressure]{.underline} on Japan, Japanese pressure on the United States,
[or mutual consent.]{.underline} U.S. officials who argue that the
United States cannot reduce the role of nuclear weapons in the alliance
because Japan might develop nuclear weapons obvi-ously believe Japanese
officials are exerting pressure on the United States. Yet [all the
Japanese officials we recently interviewed]{.underline}---[including the
lead political officer who testified in 2009 in support of redeploy-ing
U.S.]{.underline} tactical [[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} in
Asia---[[argue that Japan has **no leverage** on the U.S. nuclear
posture]{.underline}.]{.mark} [The opinions]{.underline} expressed in
these interviews [are consistent with those in a confidential
Japanese]{.underline} De-fense Agency ([JDA]{.underline}) **[study of
Japan's nuclear options]{.underline}** [conducted by some of the
country's **most conserva-tive** defense analysts.]{.underline} [The
study was]{.underline} [commissioned]{.underline} by Japanese elected
leaders [to inform their decision on whether to back a permanent
extension of the NPT]{.underline} in 1995. At the time, North Korea had
embarked on a program to develop nuclear weapons, and the Chinese
Communist Party, which had recently crushed stu-dent-led protests with
lethal military force, was threatening Taiwan with missile launches. The
study also considered the possibility that China might use nuclear
intimidation to reinforce its claims to the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands, a
focus of tensions be-tween Japan and China. **[The [study found no
imaginable scenario where a decision to develop nuclear weapons would be
in Ja-pan's national security interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Even
in a worst-case scenario]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[positing a "break-up
of the U.S.- Japan alli-ance, [a]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[collapse of
the nonproliferation regime]{.mark},]{.underline}** [and an inclination
of various countries to go nuclear," the study concludes: **[Even in
such a case]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [it is questionable whether
there is any value]{.underline} [for a trading nation that de-pends on
the stability of international society to try to secure its
survival]{.underline} and protect its interests [with its own nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} **[[It would more like-ly undermine the basis of
its own survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Only in a case where
destitution reaches a stage where the exchange of damage with an
opponent is not a concern anymore, would the geopolitical vul-nerability
of Japan make the nuclear option a possibility. **[This, however, is a
case where a con-dition becomes its own goal, and is [not worthy of
consideration"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (JDA 1995). [If Japan's most
conservative defense analysts]{.underline} [believe that a collapse of
both the NPT and the U.S.-Japan alliance are not cause to develop
nuclear weap-ons]{.underline}, [modest changes to U.S. nuclear weapons
poli-cy]{.underline}---such as taking all U.S. land-based ICBMs off
hair-trigger alert---**[should not raise fears that Japan might respond
by withdrawing from the NPT and starting a nuclear weapons
program.]{.underline}**

#### No prolif -- technical and political hurdles 

**Holmes, former US Navy surface warfare officer, 12** (James, "Japan:
Joining the Nuclear Weapons Club? It Could.,"
<http://thediplomat.com/2012/10/japan-joining-the-nuclear-weapons-club-it-could/>)

[[Despite]{.underline} [Japan\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} [renown for
[high-tech wizardry]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} long
[experience]{.mark} operating nuclear power plants,]{.underline} [[it
would take Tokyo far longer than a year to deploy a **working nuclear
arsenal. We\'re talking many years**]{.underline}. As J. C. Wylie
defines it, strategy is a plan for using available resources and assets
to accomplish some goal. Strategy goes no farther than those implements
can carry it ---]{.mark} and strategists cannot simply conjure them into
being. Toshi and I see a variety of impediments to a Japanese breakout.
Let\'s catalogue just a few. [Consider the]{.underline} politics. **[It
is certainly true that nu[clear weapons are no longer the third rail of
Japanese politics --- a topic officials]{.mark} and pundits [dare not
touch lest it strike them (politically) dead]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But
[[Japan\'s **painful past experience**]{.mark} as a target of **atomic
warfare**, [its **ardent sponsorship of nonprolif**]{.mark}**eration
accords**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the fury with which
[pacifist-leaning citizens]{.mark} and Japan\'s Asian neighbors would
greet evidence of a bombmaking program [add up to a **forbidding
political barrier**]{.mark}.]{.underline} That barrier is hardly
unbreachable, but it would demand quite a feat of political persuasion
on Tokyo\'s part. As the learned strategist Mike Tyson points out,
\"everyone has a strategy \'til they get punched in the mouth.\" Memo to
nuclear-weapons advocates: duck! Nor are the strategic, operational, and
technical challenges less daunting. A nuclear triad --- land- and
sea-based missiles combined with weapons delivered by manned bombers ---
holds little promise in light of Japan\'s lack of geographic depth and
the vulnerability of surface ships and aircraft to enemy action. That
means fielding an undersea deterrent would be Tokyo\'s best nuclear
option. But doing so would be far from easy. The Japan Maritime
Self-Defense Force operates an impressive fleet of diesel submarines but
has no experience with naval nuclear propulsion. And that leaves aside
the difficulty of developing sea-launched ballistic missiles and their
nuclear payloads. Such engineering challenges are far from insoluble for
Japan\'s scientific-technical complex but cannot be conquered overnight.
A force of nuclear-powered ballistic-missile subs, or SSBNs, thus looks
like a remote prospect for Japan. As an interim solution, the JMSDF
might construct cruise missiles resembling the U.S. Navy\'s old TLAM-Ns,
or nuclear-tipped Tomahawks. JMSDF boats could fire such missiles
through torpedo tubes, the easiest method. Or, shipyards could backfit
Japanese subs with vertical launchers --- much as the U.S. Navy
installed Tomahawk launchers in its fast attack boats starting in the
late Cold War. The problem of constructing nuclear weapons small enough
to fit on a missile would remain --- but nuclear-armed diesel boats
would represent a viable course of action should Japan decide to join
the nuclear-weapons club. **[[Years down the
road]{.mark},]{.underline}** then --- **[[not
overnight]{.underline}]{.mark}** [--- [a modest Japanese nuclear
deterrent might put out to sea]{.underline}. **[Will Tokyo proceed down
that road? I doubt It]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** But the
prospect no longer appears unthinkable.

[Far from reinforcing South Korea\'s already overwhelming offensive
military capabilities]{.underline}-including in almost every dimension
where North Korea has tried to develop \"asymmetric\"
capabilities-[South Korean [nuclear weapons]{.mark} [would
undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} conventional deterrence and even reduce
[South Korea\'s ability to use [its conventional
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} in response to a North Korean attack. Above
all, [we see its feasibility as very low because of severe political,
legal, and institutional obstacles]{.underline}. There is no doubt that
South Korea has the technological and financial capability to develop
nuclear weapons. But it has never been easy, and won\'t be so at any
time soon, for South Korea to arm itself with nuclear weapons, let alone
with a submarine or bomber-based nuclear retaliatory capacity that is
immune from preemption-the basis of stable nuclear deterrence. [[It
would take]{.mark} South Korea [years to develop]{.mark} and deploy even
a minimum deterrent.]{.underline} [[Until then, it would not possess a
credible second-strike capability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Initially, [a
South Korean nuclear force would be vastly inferior to current US
nuclear capabilities. It also lacks the]{.underline} space-based and
high-altitude reconnaissance and other [intelligence systems needed to
accurately hit]{.underline} mobile military or leadership
[targets]{.underline}. [While it develops]{.underline} [its own nuclear
weapons]{.underline} force-and assuming that doing so leads to rupture
of the US-ROK alliance-[[South Korea would be vulnerable to a preemptive
first strike by Russia or China, who would certainly target
it.]{.underline}]{.mark} Seoul would lack a countervailing ability to
strike back after suffering a nuclear attack. This may not be of concern
in peacetime But in wartime, these two nuclear-weapons states would be
obliged to treat a South Korean nuclear force as a potential threat (as
they may do already and likely already do so with regard to North
Korea\'s nascent nuclear force). Where would South Korea test and deploy
the weapons under such circumstances? Inwhose backyard? The late
American political scientist Kenneth Waltz argued that nuclear
proliferation may lead to strategic stability based on the threat of
mutual nuclear annihi ation.QQ\] But John on-fat Wong argued decades ago
that two small states armed with nuclear weapons in a military standoff
are engaged in an unstable relationship that is best described as
\"mutual probable destruction\" because of their incentive to use their
nuclear weapons first rather than lose them.Q1\] That is, given the time
it would take each side to strike, an independent South Korean force
facing off against the North Korean nuclear force would be characterized
by escalation imperatives that would make the peninsula highly unstable,
with potentially catastrophic consequences. Far from reinforcing South
Korea\'s already overwhelming offensive military capabilities-including
in almost every dimension where North Korea has developed offsetting
\"asymmetric\" capabilities-South Korean nuclear weapons would undermine
deterrence based on conventional forces, and even reduce South Korea\'s
ability to use its conventional forces in response to a North Korean
attack (see below). Put in more theoretical terms, both Koreas would be
faced with a nuclear-armed adversary with a mutual incentive to strike
first. Each would therefore remain in a state of constant nuclear alert
in case the other side intended to attack immediately (in contrast to
general deterrence. where nuclear weapons cast a long shadow that makes
commanders very cautious but there is no immediate intention to attack
and therefore no reason to stay on constant high alert).Q.21 This state
of constant fear of an immediate threat of preemptive nuclear attack
would push both Koreas to invest heavi y in improved surveillance and
intelligence capabilities needed to pinpoint nuclear targets for
successful preemption, especially given the potential for deception as
to location and deployment of nuclear weapons. It would be difficult for
either Korea to achieve sufficient confidence that such intelligence
were reliable enough to launch a preemptive strike as soon as either
gained more than a few warheads and dispersed them-which North Korea has
likely done already.Indeed, for South Korea, going it alone without US
support,and possibly losing the United States altogether as senior ally,
implies reduced confidence in its intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance information, which is provided today mostly by US
extra-peninsular assets, implying that the South\'s ability to identify
targets to attack preemptively may be lacking. However, it is also
possible that in a crisis, intelligence that suggests a pending attack
combined with partial but reliable data as to locations of a substantia
lfraction of the other\'s nuclear forces could lead either Korea to
mount a damage-limiting preemptive strike.\[;li\] The complications that
an independent South Korean nuclear weapons capability would cause for
US Forces Korea and Combined Forces Command would be enormous. Put
simply, no US commander-in-chief is going to put American forces in
harm\'s way in Korea if South Korea wields nuclear weapons outside of US
political and military command-and-control. Since its creation in 1978,
Combined Forces Command has been headed by an American and combines the
US and ROK military leadership in South Korea to face North Korea.
However, nuclear weapons remained under the sole command of the American
general who also commanded us Forces Korea: nuclear command, control,
and communications were never shared with ROK m111tary counterparts when
US nuclear weapons were deployed in South Korea (from 1958to 1991). In
the European context, only one state in alliance with the United
States-the United Kingdom with its \"special relationship\"-developed
its own nuclear forces. Except for a few naval and aerial tactical
nuclear weapons, all UK strategic and aerial nuclear weapons were
dedicated to NATO and, ultimately, were commanded by NATO\'s American
military head.Q2\] (French nuclear weapons were kept outside of NATO\'s
integrated command after the force de frappe was created in 1966.) Given
the stakes in Korea, 1t is incredible that the United States would
violate the principles of unified command when it comes to nuclear
weapons and accept a unilateral capacity by South Korea to start a
nuclear war. Indeed, in the case of the United Kingdom, NATO commanders
assumed that once released from direct US control in wartime, allied
forces armed with nuclear weapons would rapidly lose communication with
nuclear commanders, creating a risk of loss of control that would deter
Soviet aggressors .Q§\] This is not a precedent that the United States
will want to repeat in Korea. To the extent that both Koreas became
fully armed with operational nuclear forces targeting each other across
the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), independent South Korean nuclear weapons
would not only create a more volatile standoff than the Korean Peninsula
already has. They would contribute to a rigid and permanent (until it
failed) state of psychologicalwarfare and nuclear threats even more
ferocious than that seen over much (but not all) of the last six
decades. Of course, it is possible that both sides would recognize the
immense danger in escalation/de-escalation strategies involving nuclear
threat, as did India and Pakistan in the 1999 Kargil crisis. But the
opposite also seems just as possible given the nature of the Korean
conflict which, unlike the India-Pakistan conflict, involves intense
dimensions of a civil war as well as ideological collisions. In short, a
nuclear-armed South Korea would ensure the continuing division and
antagonism between the two Koreas and would undermine inter-Korean trust
politik, peace politik, or anything other than mutual destruction
politik for the indefinite future. This nuclear standoff would be made
even more volatile because one or both Koreas armed with nuclear weapons
may believe that nuclear weapons provide a threshold below which covert
or even overt conventional military provocations may be undertaken,
because the aggressor Korea believes that the victim Korea would see the
risk of escalation to nuclear war arising from retaliation as too great
This is the obvious lesson learned from the North\'s attack on the ROK
warship Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010.QZJ The
same lesson has been learned by India facing Pakistani-originated
violence in Kashmir and MumbaiQfil [[South Korea would face]{.mark} very
high [costs]{.mark} were it [to move to nuclear armament]{.mark}
[because it is]{.mark} deeply [embedded in]{.mark} a network of

[International Atomic Energy Agency]{.underline}
([[IAEA]{.underline}]{.mark}) , whose [[alarm bells will ring
loudly]{.mark} the moment that South Korea starts a nuclear weapons
program]{.underline}. [It cannot emulate Israel, which has refused to
sign the NPT]{.underline} and is believed to be one of the states with a
clandestine nuclear weapons program. Seoul would have to emulate
Pyongyang if it pursues nuclear weapons sovereignty. Like the North in
1994, [[the]{.underline} [South would have to leave the
NPT]{.underline}]{.mark} using the pretext of emergency. But unlike
North Korea, which had almost no external nuclear ties or market
relations to lose, [South Korea is highly involved in global
markets]{.underline}. [The ROK\'s global reputation is exemplified by
South Koreans serving as UN secretary-general and World Bank
president.]{.underline} To say the least, [**[it would

larger **energy shortfall** than Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} had to deal
with after shutting down all its nuclear plants [[in
2011]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Also]{.underline} [at risk would be
the]{.underline} 1974 [bilateral nuclear energy cooperation accord with
the United States]{.underline}. The United States would be obliged by
domestic law to cut off all ties in nuclear cooperation and demand
restitution of uranium stock, including spent fuel. Bilateral relations
could turn frigid fast, as in the 1970s when Seoul secretly pursued a
nuclear weapons program.\[11\] Even if Seoul promised not to use nuclear
weapons-re lated capabilities for anything but peaceful purposes, it
would undercut its own attempt to rewrite the bilateral 123 nuclear
agreement (Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act) that needs to be
renewed after March 2016. Should the South start to acquire nuclear
weapons, Washington would likely reject out of hand not only Seoul\'s
request to reprocess or pyre-process spent nuclear fuel, but alsoits
desire to enrich uranium, even for research. An independent South Korean
quest for nuclear weapons will not only justify North Korea\'s nuclear
status and diminish the opposition from China and Russia to the North\'s
nuclear armament, but could also trigger [[a nuclear domino
effect]{.underline}]{.mark} in Northeast Asia. South Korea would have to
take into account hostile Japan and China armed with nuclear weapons in
its defense planning. It should be noted that some ultra-rightists in
Japan relish the prospect that Seoul might make such a move so that they
can justify Japanese nuclear weapons. [Generalized nuclear armament

http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/n-korea-wont-cause-a-nuclear-domino-in-asia-but-china-might/)

On Thursday the Wall Street Journal published excerpts from an interview
it conducted with South Korean President Park Geun-hye. [One article
from the
interview](http://online.wsj.com/articles/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-warns-on-nuclear-domino-effect-1401377403)
discusses the dire consequences President Park foresees if North Korea
goes through with a fourth nuclear weapons test. "North Korea would
effectively be crossing the Rubicon if they were to conduct another
nuclear test," WSJ quotes Park as saying. President Park has also
suggested that the six-party talks over North Korea's nuclear program
could end for good if Pyongyang goes through with its threat to conduct
a new kind of nuclear test. The article goes on to say that President
[Park]{.underline} also [claimed]{.underline} that [a fourth nuclear
test by North Korea could spark a nuclear arms race in the region, where
non-nuclear weapon states decide to acquire a nuclear deterrent in
response]{.underline} to Pyongyang's growing atomic capabilities. "It
would be difficult for us to prevent a nuclear domino from occurring in
this area," were North Korea to conduct another test, Park is quoted as
saying. Park is hardly the first to worry that a new state acquiring a
nuclear weapon will have a nuclear domino effect among its neighbors.
Indeed, this has been a constant concern in the United States since the
dawn of the nuclear era. This concern continues today with many in
Washington claiming that Iran acquiring a nuclear arsenal would spark a
nuclear arms race in the already volatile Middle East. Nor is Park wrong
to emphasize that North Korea conducting another test could be
especially problematic for its neighbors. While many attribute North
Korea's nuclear and missile tests entirely to domestic politics,
Pyongyang's interest in continuing with tests is almost certainly due to
its desire acquire a nuclear deterrent. The only way to be certain that
a state has achieved this status is by conducting actual tests, which is
why every nuclear state (very possibly including Israel) has carried out
tests. The next few North Korean nuclear tests will be particularly
important because many believe that it is on the verge of being able to
build a nuclear warhead small enough to be placed on top of a missile.
This will give it the operational nuclear deterrent that it has
heretofore lacked. While North Korea will initially still lack the
capability to reach the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM), it will only be a matter of time before it can
achieve this too. As we saw in the Cold War when the Soviet Union
acquired the capability to reach the continental United States with
nuclear missiles, North Korea's ability to target the U.S. homeland will
complicate extended deterrence. Still, [Park's [warnings about]{.mark}
North [Korea's growing capabilities creating a nuclear domino effect in
Asia **is merely bluster**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This view is
**premised** on the argument that states acquire nuclear weapons to
deter rival nuclear armed states]{.underline}. [This was true in the
early nuclear era when non-nuclear states had no reason to believe that
their nuclear-armed rivals would not use nuclear weapons against
them]{.underline}. As the nuclear era progressed, however, it became
clear that [nuclear weapons **would not be used** in the same manner as
other military capabilities]{.underline} would. In the words of many,
**[a taboo against the first use of nuclear weapons took
root]{.underline}**. **[This taboo is especially strong when it comes to
using nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state]{.underline}**. [North
Korea would be **particularly unlikely** to break this taboo by
launching a nuclear attack against South Korea or Japan]{.underline}. To
begin with, [it will have an **extremely small** nuclear
arsenal]{.underline} given its financial constraints. Moreover, [it
will]{.underline} also [have little in the way of early warning
capabilities]{.underline}. This is important because attacking Seoul or
Tokyo with nuclear weapons would almost certainly invite a retaliatory
nuclear strike from the U.S. And, given the small size of its nuclear
arsenal and its inability to detect incoming U.S. nuclear missiles, its
entire nuclear arsenal would be wiped out in a U.S. first strike. At
that point, [it would be **defenseless**]{.underline} against a
conventional attack aimed at overthrowing the regime, which [Washington
would have every reason to carry out should Pyongyang break the nuclear
taboo]{.underline}. [[South Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} and Japan
**[understand all this and therefore [would not endure the enormous
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}** (**[especially [to their]{.mark}
international [reputation]{.mark}s, [alliances]{.mark} with the U.S.,
[and relations]{.mark} with China]{.underline}**) [inherent in acquiring
a nuclear weapon]{.underline}. An isolated state like North Korea can
endure massive international sanctions. Nations with economies highly
integrated in the global economy --- such as [South
[Korea]{.mark}]{.underline} and Japan --- **[[cannot afford to be cut
off from the outside world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[That's why South
Korea is investing in **conventional capabilities** that would allow it
to deal with North Korea's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Although [North Korea is unlikely to precipitate a nuclear arms race in
Asia,]{.mark} **China's growing military capabilities**]{.underline} and
assertive diplomatic posture **[very well might]{.underline}**. Indeed,
just as history has demonstrated that states don't need nuclear arsenals
to deter rivals from attacking them with nuclear weapons, it has also
demonstrated that nuclear weapons are extremely effective in deterring
conventional military attacks. Thus, [states that face rivals with
overwhelming conventional military power have a strong incentive to
acquire nuclear weapons]{.underline} to negate their rivals'
conventional superiority. This is especially true if a state fears that
its conventionally superior rival covets its territory. A nuclear
arsenal cannot always deter low level skirmishes from nuclear and
non-nuclear powers. But nuclear weapons are extremely effective at
deterring states from challenging core interests, first and foremost
territory. This is deeply troubling given present trends in the
Asia-Pacific. Most notably, China's economic rise is allowing it to
amass a conventional military force that Japan, especially with its
declining population, will eventually be incapable of matching. China
also claims the Senkaku Islands that Japan administers and there's been
evidence that it may ultimately covet the Ryukyu Islands as well. Thus,
[if current trends in the Sino-Japanese conventional balance
continue]{.underline}, **[going nuclear will be an increasingly
attractive option for Tokyo]{.underline}**, particularly if it loses
faith in America's willingness or ability to defend it.

Second, more specifically, [**I am [not sure that]{.mark} a [Japanese

proliferation]{.mark}.** Developing]{.underline} nuclear [weapons is a
big step]{.underline} for anyone. [[Who]{.mark} among the non-nuclear

altered]{.mark}]{.underline} by a Japanese nuclear capability [[that

[is South Korea]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} if, like me, [you are a

Asia]{.underline}, I think [[flow-on proliferation effects are **much
less likely**]{.mark}: would Australia, or Indonesia, be more likely to
seek nuclear weapons because Japan had them?]{.underline} Thirdly, [we
might ask whether the non-proliferation regime could
survive]{.underline} by [adapting to accommodate a nuclear-armed
Japan.]{.underline} Is this unthinkable? Surely not, when serious
thought is being given to accommodating India as a nuclear-armed
country.

### 2AC Taiwan Prolif DA -- No Alliance Collapse 

#### The plan [strengthens]{.underline} alliance relationships

**Glaser, 15** - Charles L Glaser is a professor in the Elliott School
of International Affairs and the Department of Political Science at
George Washington University. He is also a fellow in the Kissinger
Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ("A
U.S.-China Grand Bargain?" International Security, Vol. 39, No. 4
(Spring 2015), pp. 49--90, doi:10.1162/ISEC_a_00199

A third potential security danger is that accommodation by the United
States could undermine its allies' assessments of the credibility of the
United States to come to their aid if attacked by China. More
specifically, critics believe that ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan
could lead the Japanese to doubt America's commitment to defend Japan,
which would undermine the U.S.-Japan alliance and in turn reduce U.S.
security. Tucker and Glaser argue, "[A U.S. decision to abandon
Taiwan]{.underline}---leading to unification of an unwilling Taiwan with
China--- [would be particularly alarming to Japan. . . . If Japan begins
to doubt U.S. reliability, that could deal a **fatal blow** to the
U.S.-Japan alliance]{.underline}."97 Although a decision by the United
States to end its commitment to Taiwan would certainly send political
shock waves across the region, **[these concerns are
overstated]{.underline}**. There are similarities between the U.S.
commitments to Taiwan and Japan, but also clear differences. [U.S.
security interests in Japan are much greater; as a result, the alliance
involves much stronger political commitments and the deep integration of
U.S. and Japanese military capabilities]{.underline}.

In addition, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates h[as a clear
rationale for ending its commitment to Taiwan that does not apply to
Japan: the U.S. commitment to Taiwan strains the U.S.-China relationship
and increases the probability of war in ways that the U.S. commitment to
Japan does not]{.underline}. Japan should appreciate these differences
and therefore recognize that the ending of the U.S. commitment to Taiwan
would not indicate a coming diminution of the U.S. commitment to Japan.
[U.S. leaders could work to make sure that their Japanese counterparts
fully appreciate these differences]{.underline}.

In addition, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could take
other actions that would starkly distinguish its policies toward Japan
from its policies toward Taiwan, which should help to offset doubts that
accommodation on Taiwan might create]{.underline}. Most obviously, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could increase the size and
improve the quality of the forces it commits to Japan's protection.
Other policies could include further deepening U.S.-Japan joint military
planning and continuing high-level discussions of the requirements for
extending deterrence to Japan]{.underline}. Growth in Chinese
conventional and nuclear forces has increased the importance of these
interactions; ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan would make them still
more valuable.98

Finally, as China's power continues to grow, Japan's need for U.S.
security guarantees will also grow. [Doubts about U.S. reliability are
therefore likely to convince Japan **to work harder to strengthen the
U.S.-Japan alliance**, not to abandon it]{.underline} or to bandwagon
with China.99

#### The commitment to Taiwan [weakens]{.underline} alliances -- plan boosts them

**Goldstein, 15 -** associate professor in the Strategic Research
Department at the US Naval War College (NWC). He was also the founding
director of the NWC\'s China Maritime Studies Institute (Lyle, [Meeting
China Halfway]{.underline}, p. 71)

Two plausible objections may be discussed briefly at this point, though
each is dealt with more comprehensively in chapter 12, the book's
conclusion. A first objection concerns the oft-made argument that any
concession to Beijing represents "appeasement" that will only invite
greater aggression. For those making this argument, Taiwan is the
"ultimate prize" for Beijing, and thus would raise China's confidence to
unacceptably high levels. [A related argument]{.underline} concerning
the fate of US alliances in the Asia-Pacific region [is made
that]{.underline} any kind of [reunification between the Mainland and
Taiwan would signal a "death blow" to the US-Japan Alliance, and other
allies]{.underline} would also be dubious of the US commitment to the
region's security. However, [both arguments turn out to be
specious---having been built on **crude and simplistic**
assumptions.]{.underline} A clear view of history shows plainly that
Beijing approaches the Taiwan issue quite differently than other issues,
and so the expectation that China, following unification, would
immediately seek to apply its hubris to other issues only stretches the
imagination. [The "Munich" appeasement argument]{.underline} also [seems
to be ignorant of geography, neglecting the fact that **Taiwan's defense
is not feasible** over the long term]{.underline}. White quite correctly
concludes: "America can no longer defend Taiwan from China, and a policy
towards Taiwan that presumes that it can is unsustainable."68 Even
putting military capabilities aside, as Nathan and Scobell relate,
"Beijing is convinced that it enjoys an asymmetry of motivation over the
United States with respect to Taiwan."69 Moreover, a Washington policy
premised on Munich-type fears also ignores the fact that Mainland China
has reasonable expectations for its security. As for the US alliance
structure, this book is advocating major changes in that structure, in
the hope that it would evolve toward something lighter and more
defensive. [Credibility is logically questioned when commitments exceed
genuine US national interests. If US commitments in the Asia-Pacific
region are constrained to cover only the clearest threats to US national
security (thus excluding Taiwan]{.underline}, in addition to various
rocks and reefs along China's maritime periphery), **[those alliance
relationships will actually be strengthened]{.underline}**. Thus, [it is
well known that many South Koreans, Japanese, and others in the region
have been reasonably concerned that their states]{.underline}, quite
against their will, **[might be pulled by treaty commitments into the
vortex of a Taiwan scenario]{.underline}**. [Having alleviated such
alliance strains, chiefly caused by unreasonable war-fighting
requirements, these alliances will actually benefit from enhanced and
increasingly stable Taiwan--Mainland integration]{.underline}.

### 2AC Taiwan Prolif DA -- Asian Prolif Good 

#### Prolif would curb nuclear threats which *[solves]{.underline}* Sino-Japanese tensions

**Samuels and Schoff 13 (Richard, Professor of Political Science and
Director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, James, Senior Associate in the Asia Program at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Japan's Nuclear Hedge:
Beyond \"Allergy\" and Breakout"
https://www.nbr.org/publication/japans-nuclear-hedge-beyond-allergy-and-breakout/)**

Compared to North Korea, [China's nuclear arsenal and conventional
capabilities are much larger and weigh heavily on the minds of Japanese
defense planners]{.underline}. The main worry is not simply that China's
defense budget has almost tripled since 2001 to become the world's
second largest.63 Rather, it is [the nature of China's military
modernization and the relatively quick and substantial investments in
capabilities that are aimed at the allies' ability to dominate the skies
and seas around East Asia]{.underline}. [This strategic force
modernization raises the potential costs that U.S. policymakers would
need to weigh when considering the option of intervening against Chinese
interests on behalf of Japan or Taiwan]{.underline}. Another long-term
problem is that China keeps building new nuclear warheads (up to ten in
2012). Although official Chinese policy states that China will not use
nuclear weapons first--- or ever against a non--nuclear weapon
state---[its [intimidation tactics]{.mark} in the maritime and cyber
domains have [worried]{.mark} some in [Japan]{.mark} that these tactics
could someday [spread to the nuclear realm]{.mark}]{.underline}.64 The
People's Liberation Army ([PLA), after all, manages one of the world's
most active ballistic-missile programs]{.underline}. Many of its
tactical weapons have enhanced ranges, accuracies, and payloads, and
some put Okinawa within range when forward-deployed. [[Upgrades
to]{.mark} Chinese missile [warheads]{.mark}---including multiple
independently targeted re-entry vehicles---are [enhancing]{.mark}
Beijing's deterrent and [strategic-strike capabilities]{.mark} vis-à-vis

[upgrades to the quality and quantity]{.underline} of Chinese nuclear
weapons [have some in Tokyo wondering whether Beijing will eventually
seek nuclear parity with the United State]{.underline}s, something that
would require considerable time and investment, since the U.S. arsenal
is significantly larger. [[Japanese]{.mark} strategists have to [ask how
much vulnerability]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is
willing to [tolerate]{.mark} amid China's strategic modernization and
what it is prepared to do [on Japan's]{.mark} [behalf]{.mark}, if
anything, in response to China's moves]{.underline}.66 Some [prominent
Japanese analysts suggest that **[a national nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}**, [even]{.mark} if it were [insufficient to
deter]{.mark} a force as big as China's [in all circumstances]{.mark},
**could [complicate strategic calculations]{.mark}** in Beijing [to the
extent that **China would think twice before threatening**]{.mark} **to
use ([or]{.mark} actually [using]{.mark}) its own [nuclear
forces]{.mark}** in a regional crisis or conflict]{.underline}.67 In
short, [Japan faces its own threats and has its own
interest]{.underline}s. As Campbell and Sunohara suggest, "the
persistence of a Japanese-American alliance so robust that it can
indefinitely persuade Japanese leaders from acquiring nuclear weapons
cannot be guaranteed."68

Free nuclear guarantees provided by the United States, coupled with the
US Navy patrolling offshore, have allowed our allies to grow prosperous
without having to invest much in their own defense. Confident that the
United States protects them, our allies have even begun to squabble with
China over strings of uninhabited islands in the hope that there is oil
out there. It is time to give them a dose of fiscal and military
reality. And the way to do that is to stop standing between them and
their nuclear-armed neighbors. It will not be long before they realize
the value of having their own nuclear weapons. [[The]{.mark} waters of

China and other countries have become nuclear powers without making the

possession of nuclear weapons by both India and Pakistan has deterred
both of them from going to a major war, though occasional border
skirmishes do take place without real fear of escalation on a nuclear
scale. [[Should possession]{.mark} of nuclear weapons

cautious behavior by their possessors and deterred any of them from
threatening others' vital interests. Besides China, [North Korea's
nuclear program could precipitate decisions both in Japan and South
Korea to revisit their nuclear option]{.underline}. By implication, such
a decision would mean the abrogation of their security alliance
relationship with the United States, which would also mean reordering
the security dynamics in East Asia, where all countries would claim to
be equal in terms of sovereignty, territorial integrity and pride.

[Except for their effects on agonies, obsessions, rhetoric, posturing,
and spending, the [consequences of]{.mark} nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration [have been]{.mark} largely
[benign]{.mark}]{.underline}: [those who have acquired the weapons have
"used" them simply to stoke their egos or to deter real or imagined
threats]{.underline}. For the most part, [nuclear powers have found the
weapons to be a notable waste of time, money, effort, and scientific
talent]{.underline}. They have quietly kept the weapons in storage and
haven't even found much benefit in rattling them from time to time. If
the recent efforts to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons have been
successful, those efforts have done Iran a favor.

There has never been a militarily compelling reason to use nuclear
weapons, particularly because it has not been possible to identify
suitable targets---or targets that couldn't be attacked as effectively
by conventional munitions. Conceivably, conditions exist under which
nuclear weapons could serve a deterrent function, but there is little
reason to suspect that they have been necessary to deter war thus far,
even during the Cold War. The main Cold War contestants have never
believed that a repetition of World War II, whether embellished by
nuclear weapons or not, is remotely in their interests.

Moreover, the [[weapons have not proved to be crucial status
symbols]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[How much more status would Japan have if
it possessed]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}? [[Would
anybody pay]{.mark} a great deal [more attention]{.mark} to Britain or
France [if]{.mark} their [arsenals held 5,000]{.mark} nuclear weapons,
[or]{.mark} much less if they had [none]{.mark}]{.underline}? [Did China
need nuclear weapons to impress the world with its economic growth or
its Olympics]{.underline}?

Those considerations help explain why **[[alarmists have been wrong for
decades]{.mark} about the pace]{.underline}** [of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. Most famously, in the 1960s, President John
[Kennedy anticipated that in another decade "fifteen or twenty or
twenty-five nations may have these weapons]{.underline}." Yet, [[of the
dozens of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark} that have
considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, very [few have done
so]{.mark}.]{.underline} Insofar as most [leaders]{.underline} of most
countries (even rogue ones) have considered acquiring the weapons, they
[have come to appreciate several drawbacks]{.underline} of doing so:
[nuclear weapons are dangerous, costly, and likely to rile the
neighbors]{.underline}. Moreover, as the University of Southern
California's Jacques [Hymans]{.underline} has
[demonstrated]{.underline}, [the [weapons have]{.mark} also [been
exceedingly difficult]{.mark} for administratively dysfunctional
countries [to obtain]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[it took decades for North
Korea and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so. In consequence,
**[[alarmist predictions about]{.mark} proliferation chains,
[cascades]{.mark}, dominoes, waves, avalanches, epidemics, and [points
of no return have proved faulty.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Although [[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [[has]{.mark} so far [had
little consequence]{.mark}, that is [not because]{.mark} the only
[countries]{.mark} to get nuclear weapons [have had rational
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Large, important countries that acquired
the bomb were run at the time by unchallenged]{.underline}---perhaps
certifiably deranged---[monsters]{.underline}. Consider Joseph Stalin,
who, in 1949, was planning to change the climate of the Soviet Union by
planting a lot of trees, and Mao Zedong, who, in 1964, had just carried
out a bizarre social experiment that resulted in an artificial famine in
which tens of millions of Chinese perished.

[[Some]{.mark} also [fear]{.mark} that [a country might use]{.mark} its
nuclear [weapons to "dominate"]{.mark} its area]{.underline}. [That
argument was used with dramatic urgency before 2003 when Saddam Hussein
supposedly posed great danger, and it has been frequently applied to
Iran]{.underline}. [[Exactly how]{.mark} that domination is to be
carried out [is never made clear]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The
notion, apparently, is this: should an atomic rogue state rattle the
occasional rocket, other countries in the area, suitably intimidated,
would bow to its demands. Far more likely, [threatened states would make
common cause with each other and with other concerned
countries]{.underline} (including nuclear ones) [against the threatening
neighbor]{.underline}. **[That is how countries coalesced into an
alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's region-threatening invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.]{.underline}**

Yet [[another concern has been that the weapons will go off, by
accident]{.underline}]{.mark} or miscalculation, devastating the planet
in the process: the weapons exist in the thousands, sooner or later one
or more of them will inevitably go off. But those **[[prognostications
have now failed to deliver for 70 years.]{.underline}]{.mark}** That
time period suggests something more than luck is operating. Moreover,
the notion that if one nuclear weapon goes off in one place, the world
will necessarily be plunged into thermonuclear cataclysm should remain
in the domain of Hollywood scriptwriters.

[Despite]{.underline} the [popularity of the]{.underline} nuclear
[domino theory]{.underline} among policymakers, [[the]{.mark} academic
[lit]{.mark}]{.underline}erature has [[turned against
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The reason is obvious]{.underline}: several
[[decades of pessimistic]{.mark} prolif]{.underline}eration
[[forecasts]{.underline}]{.mark} based on falling dominoes [[were
proved]{.mark} **[embarrassingly wrong]{.mark} by
history**]{.underline}. Moeed Yusuf notes that [if all the]{.underline}
\"first tier\" [suspects for nuclear acquisition]{.underline} identified
in such reports [had become weapons states there would be nineteen
nuc]{.underline}lear [powers today]{.underline} (Yusuf 2009: 61).
[Instead]{.underline}, as noted above, [the number of]{.underline}
technically [capable nuclear states has grow]{.underline}n, while the
[number of weapons states]{.underline} has [remained small]{.underline}.
Moreover, there was relatively little variation in the number of states
in the \"exploration\" or \"pursuit\" phases of nuclear programs during
the Cold War, [despite instances of prolif]{.underline}eration [that
ought to have caused domino behavior]{.underline}. After the Cold War,
[there has been a striking decline in nuclear interest, as more states
abandon]{.underline} their [programs and fewer]{.underline} states
[initiate new ones]{.underline} (Miller 2014a: 10-11).¶ The [judgment of
scholars has been **scathing**]{.underline}. Yusuf concludes that \"an
evident shortcoming of historical predictions was their inability to
accurately estimate the pace of developments \... [[the majority
of]{.underline}]{.mark} \[[potential]{.underline} nuclear
[[dominoes]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [**[never even came close]{.mark}** to
crossing the threshold]{.underline}. In fact, [most did not even
initiate a weapons program]{.underline}\" (Yusuf 2009: 61). John Mueller
suggests that [projections of falling nuclear dominoes]{.underline}
\"[have shown a want of prescience that approaches]{.underline} the
monumental-even the **[pathological]{.underline}** \... \[[fear of a
nuclear tipping point]{.underline}\] continues to flourish [despite the
fact that it has]{.underline} thus far [proven]{.underline} to be almost
**[entirely wrong]{.underline}**\" (Mueller 2009: 89). Francis [[Gavin
finds no \"**compelling ev**]{.underline}]{.mark}idence [[that a]{.mark}
nuclear [prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[chain reaction will ever
occur]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (Gavin 2009: 18). [A two-volume
study]{.underline} led by William Potter and Gaukhar Mukhatzhanova
[cites [a]{.mark} \"**[consensus]{.mark}** [among]{.mark} the case study
[authors]{.mark}]{.underline} \... [that [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons
[spread is]{.mark} [neither imminent nor likely]{.mark} to involve a
process in which one country\'s pursuit of nuclear weapons leads to a
\'chain reaction\']{.underline} involving other states\" (Potter and
Mukhatzhanova 2010: 337-338).¶ [Research]{.underline} also [suggests
that **[even where security concerns matter]{.mark}** for]{.underline}
[prolif]{.underline}eration, [their influence is more diffuse and
complex than]{.underline} is generally [believed]{.underline}. Thus,
[even where prolif]{.underline}eration [causes [security fears]{.mark},
it [may **not beget more prolif**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration. Phillip
[Bleek\'s [**statistical analysis** suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[nuc]{.underline}lear [[acquisition by]{.mark} regional [competitors
has]{.mark} only a modest effect on state exploration of
nuc]{.underline}lear [programs and **[no impact]{.mark}** on whether
they pursue or acquire an arsenal]{.underline}. In contrast, a state\'s
history of conventional military disputes with its rivals strongly
impacts all three phases of nuclear development (Bleek 2010: 177). Bleek
interprets these results to mean, in part, that states seek nuclear
weapons for a particular sort of security-deterring attack, not because
of security competition in general. That conclusion is consistent with
other recent studies (Sechser and Fuhrmann 2013: 173-195). Thus, Bleek
concludes that his \"[findings]{.underline} [strongly contradict the
conventional \'reactive prolif]{.underline}eration\' [wisdom that
underpins widespread predictions]{.underline} . . . [of]{.underline}
proliferation [cascades, dominoes, tipping points, and the
like]{.underline}\" (Bleek 2010: 179).¶ The causes of nuclear weapons
proliferation reviewed above offer a reason to reject nuclear dominoes
and tipping points. As Potter and Mukhatzhanova summarize, \"a [fixation
on security drivers]{.underline} \... is apt to [result in]{.underline}
the [neglect of important domestic economic and political constraints
and]{.underline} to [exaggerate]{.underline} the [propensity of states
to proliferate]{.underline},\" [even given]{.underline}
[prolif]{.underline}eration [elsewhere]{.underline} (Potter and
Mukhatzhanova 2010: 338). Hymans\' focus on individual psychology, for
instance, implies that:¶ [[**Leaders\' preferences**
are]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [**[not]{.mark}** highly [contingent
on what other states decide]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore,
[prolif]{.underline}eration [tomorrow will]{.underline} probably [remain
as rare as prolif]{.underline}eration [today, with no single instance
of]{.underline} [prolif]{.underline}eration [causing a cascade of new
nuclear weapons states]{.underline}. Hymans 2006: 225-226¶ Likewise,
Solingen\'s \"emphasis on **[political economic factors]{.underline}**\"
[suggests]{.underline} that [one state\'s nuclear decisions will not
directly drive another\'s]{.underline}. In the same vein,
[Hymans\']{.underline} other [work implies **[major bureaucratic
constraints]{.mark}** on reactive
prolif]{.underline}eratio[n]{.underline}. [[States are not
likely]{.mark} to [shuck off **multiple nuc**]{.mark}**lear [veto
players]{.mark}** with ease, **[even if]{.mark}** [their]{.mark}
international [environment seems]{.mark} more
[dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, if NPT scholarship is correct,
the treaty is likely to provide at least a modest barrier to reactive
proliferation. States that absorb its norms, a la Rublee, will be less
inclined to proliferate or at least more constrained in their
decision-making. States that perceive the treaty as a grand bargain, as
posited by Coe and Vaynman, are likely to stick to the agreement so long
as the great powers appear to be sanctioning the rule-breaking states.¶
Overall, [the political science]{.underline} [lit]{.underline}erature
[undermines]{.underline} primacy\'s [claims about nuclear dominoes,
and]{.underline} the [probability that]{.underline} a little [insecurity
will spawn spirals of prolif]{.underline}eration. American [alliance
[commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}, in so far as this research is
correct, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} correspondingly [[diminished
in]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[usefulness as an
anti-prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [[measure]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### No impact to nuclear proliferation---more nuclear states produce peace

**Suzuki 15** -- (June 2015, Akisato, Researcher, Institute for
International Conflict Resolution and Reconstruction, School of Law and
Government, Dublin City University, MA in Violence, Terrorism and
Security at Queen\'s University, "Is more better or worse? New empirics
on nuclear proliferation and interstate conflict by Random Forests,"
Research and Politics, SagePub)

Random Forests has three attractive and distinctive characteristics for
the purposes of this paper: first, the estimation of conditional
variable importance and partial dependence plots enable conventional
applied researchers to interpret non-parametric analysis in an intuitive
way; second, [[Random Forests]{.mark} can [examine
non-linearity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Strobl et al., 2009: 339--341),
[which is desirable because]{.underline}, as already noted, [some
theories expect non-linearity between nuclear proliferation
and]{.underline} a systemic [propensity for conflict]{.underline}; and
[finally]{.underline}, [[it can cope with]{.mark} potential
[interactions and multicollinearity between
regressors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Strobl et al., 2009: 339--341; Strobl
et al., 2008). As noted before, [most]{.underline} of the [regressors
here are highly correlated, and]{.underline} also [it is plausible to
anticipate some interaction]{.underline} effect between them
([e.g.]{.underline} the number of [democratic states and]{.underline}
the **[g]{.underline}**ross **[w]{.underline}**orld
**[p]{.underline}**roduct). **[The specific capabilities of Random
Forests are therefore essential]{.underline}**. The estimation of
conditional variable importance shows that the nuclear year counter has
a negative importance score.7 Thus, the nuclear year counter is not
important in explaining the dispute--state ratio. This suggests that the
optimist theory is supported. The remaining regressors have an
importance score higher than the absolute value of the importance score
of the nuclear year counter, meaning that they are all important.
Controlling for democratic peace, capitalist peace, and polarity, the
number of nuclear states is still a significant predictor in explaining
a systemic propensity for interstate conflict. Figure 1 presents the
partial dependence plots of the model.8 First, on average, a larger
number of nuclear states is associated with a lower dispute--state
ratio, although the changes from two nuclear states to three and from
six to seven increase the ratio instead. Thus, **[[the relationship is
empirically non-linear]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Bueno de Mesquita and
Riker (1982) and Intriligator and Brito (1981) expected in part.
[[Overall]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[the optimist theory is
supported]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [change]{.mark} from two nuclear
states to nine nuclear states **[decreases the dispute--state
ratio]{.mark}**]{.underline} approximately from 0.228 to 0.18. This
means that, if there are 194 states in the system (as there were in
2009), [[the number of militarized interstate dispute]{.mark} onsets per
system-year [decreases]{.mark}]{.underline} approximately from 44 to 35.
**[This is a substantively significant decline.]{.underline}** Second,
the nuclear year counter shows a concave relationship with the
dispute--state ratio, suggesting that new nuclear states are less prone
to conflict than middle-aged nuclear states. Thus, **[[the pessimist
theory finds no support]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from either]{.underline}
the [variable importance estimation or the partial dependence
plot]{.underline}. Finally, as for the control variables, the number of
democratic states and the gross world product have a complex non-linear
relationship with the dispute--state ratio, but [if the number of
democratic states and the **g**]{.underline}ross **[w]{.underline}**orld
**[p]{.underline}**roduct [are sufficiently large, they]{.underline}
tend to [decrease the dispute--state ratio]{.underline}.
[Their]{.underline} substantive [effects are]{.underline} also
[**significant**, though **not as much as the number of nuclear
states**.]{.underline} When comparing the effect of their lowest and
highest values (23 and 94 in the number of democratic states and 7 and
71.2 in the gross world product), the number of democratic states
decreases the number of militarized interstate dispute onsets per
system-year approximately from 40 to 37, and the gross world product
from 44 to 37. [Unipolarity is also associated with a
decline]{.underline} in the dispute--state ratio, suggesting that
unipolarity is better than bipolarity in terms of a systemic propensity
for interstate conflict; **[however, [its effect is
negligible]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as it reduces the number of
militarized interstate dispute onsets per system-year from 39 to 38. One
caveat is, as explained in the online appendix, that the results of the
number of democratic states and unipolarity are significantly sensitive
to a parameter setting. Thus, these predictors are less robust, and the
aforementioned points about them should be treated with caution.
Discussion and concluding remarks **[The main findings reveal that [the
optimist expectation]{.mark} of the relationship between nuclear
proliferation and interstate conflict [is empirically
supported]{.mark}]{.underline}**:9 first, a larger number of nuclear
states on average decreases the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict; and second, [[there is **no**]{.mark} **clear
[evidence]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} the emergence of [new nuclear states
increases]{.mark} the systemic propensity for interstate
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gartzke and Jo (2009) argue that
**[[nuclear weapons themselves have no exogenous effect on the
probability of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, because when a state is
engaged in or expects to engage in conflict, it may develop nuclear
weapons to keep fighting, or to prepare for, that conflict. If this
selection effect existed, [[the analysis]{.mark} should [overestimate
the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear proliferation]{.mark} in the
above model]{.underline}. Still, the results indicate that a larger
number of nuclear states are associated with fewer disputes in the
system. [This conclusion]{.underline}, however, [raises questions about
how to reconcile this study's findings with those of a recent
quantitative dyadic-level study]{.underline} (**[Bell and
Miller]{.underline}**, 2015). The current paper finds that nuclear
proliferation decreases the systemic propensity for interstate conflict,
while Bell and Miller (2015) find that nuclear symmetry has no
significant effect on dyadic conflict, but that nuclear asymmetry is
associated with a higher probability of dyadic conflict. [[It is
possible]{.mark} that nuclear [proliferation decreases conflict
through]{.mark} the conflict-mitigating effects of extended nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} and/or fear of nuclear states' intervention, to the
extent that these effects overwhelm the conflict-provoking effect of
nuclear--asymmetrical dyads]{.underline}. Thus, **[[dyadic-level
empirics cannot]{.mark} solely [be relied on]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
infer **causal links**]{.underline}]{.mark} between nuclear
proliferation and a systemic propensity for conflict. The
**[[systemic]{.mark}-level [empirics deserve
attention]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

## AT: Relations Advantage CP 

### 2AC Relations CP -- Taiwan Key 

#### Counterplan can't solve without making concessions to China on Taiwan -- it overshadows all other aspects of relations

**Glaser 16** Esteemed professor of political science and international
affairs and director of the Elliott School\'s Institute for Security and
Conflict Studies (Charles L. Glaser, \"Grand bargain or bad idea? US
relations with China and Taiwan,\" International Security, v. 40 #4,
Spring 2016, p.178-191)

[Kim and Easley prefer the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[current policy to a grand bargain. Both recommend some
modifications]{.underline} designed to reassure and engage China,
[including joint participation in humanitarian missions, naval
cooperation on counter-piracy operations, deepening of economic
interdependence via the U.S.-China bilateral investment
treaty]{.underline}, and support of initiatives that would increase
China's role in international organizations. As I argue in my article,
there is much to like about the current U.S. policy toward China and
East Asia more broadly. If the United States adheres to this policy,
then many of these recommendations would be useful refinements.
[Nevertheless,]{.underline} [proponents of the United States' current
China policy tend to underestimate the risks inherent in the U.S.
commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}, [**including its role in fueling
military competition and supporting Chinese elites' negative views of
U.S. motives**.]{.underline} Neither Kim nor Easley says much about
these risks, and certain of their remarks suggest they are not small.
Kim holds that China is "much more confident and ambitious" than when
President Nixon visited China in 1972 and that "Chinese leaders today
believe that the United States is determined to contain and divide China
internally." Easley expresses similar concerns, stating that
"\[f\]oreign policy ambition in Beijing has outgrown the 1950s and 1990s
cross-strait crises; \[that\] Chinese internal debates tend to paint the
United States as a global competitor," and that China "is pursuing a
Chinese centered regional architecture." Given these views of China,
[Kim's and Easley's recommendations]{.underline}, though useful, [are
**likely inadequate** to meet the challenges currently facing the United
States.]{.underline} This does not mean that such a modified U.S. policy
would necessarily be inferior to the grand bargain I have recommended,
given that all options for dealing with China's rise will involve costs
or risks, or both. [The advantage of my proposed grand
bargain,]{.underline} however, [is that it confronts the challenge posed
by China's rise head on. It offers a path for eliminating the most
serious geopolitical disagreement between the United States and China
and for moderating the concomitant political strains and military
competition]{.underline}, while providing valuable information about the
limited nature of China's goals that, in turn, reduces the risks of
accommodation. And, [in combination with policies that reaffirm and
deepen the commitment of the United States to its East Asian
allies]{.underline}, it **[would enable the United States to protect its
key interests in the region]{.underline}**. Notwithstanding the points
raised by Kim and Easely, the grand bargain remains the best bet
available to the United States.

by the American elite that the Communist dictatorship on the mainland is

with Taiwan and Tibet belie the lip service American officials pay to
the notion of "one China." The message China's civilian and military

has anything to say about it." The Chinese don't think we should have
anything to say about it.

Coercion could easily fail, making invasion a tempting option―especially
in a future scenario where the balance of power looks more favorable to
Beijing than it does today]{.underline}. Assessing the Threat: The
ever-tense political and security environment across the Taiwan Strait
necessitates an accurate depiction of PLA capabilities, strengths, and
shortfalls. The PLA\'s strengths are more apparent than its weaknesses.
China\'s military muscle is frequently highlighted and hyped up by the
media, both in Beijing and abroad. [Undoubtedly, China\'s ballistic
missiles, cyber warfare capabilities, and counter-space weapons make it
a force to be reckoned with. Perhaps even more dangerous are its
espionage and covert actions abroad to shape foreign
policymaking.]{.underline} But there is always more to the story.
Renowned Naval War College professor, Andrew Erickson, makes it clear in
his recently published book, [Chinese Naval
Shipbuilding](https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Naval-Shipbuilding-Ambitious-Development/dp/1682470814)
that while Beijing\'s fleets are growing at a remarkable clip, the PLA
Navy is not ready to support the invasion of Taiwan. The Chinese navy
still lacks the lift capacity and the air defense capability it needs.
Nonetheless, the situation will almost certainly look very different
tomorrow than it does today. Dennis Blasko, author of [The Chinese Army
Today](https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Army-Today-Tradition-Transformation/dp/0415770033),
observes that the CCP\'s ground forces, like the navy, are not yet ready
for the ultimate fight. For invasion to be a realistic option, China
would have to have far more helicopters, paratroopers, special
operators, amphibious mechanized divisions, and marines. Moreover, the
PLA would need to build a solid non-commissioned officer corps and
provide better training to unit leaders up and down the entire chain of
command. Much of this work has already begun and will start to bear
fruit over the next decade. Taiwan\'s Anti-Invasion Strategy: So how do
Taiwanese military experts plan to defend their country against attack,
and how can the United States help? Taiwan is at the tail end of a
transit from a conscription force to an all-volunteer military. Building
an elite force of professional warriors is a good thing. It gives Taiwan
a comparative advantage. China has no national army and relies mostly on
short-term draftees. According to a recent [RAND Corporation
report](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1757.html), Taiwan
could augment its all-volunteer military with elite reserve force units,
further enhancing its ability to counter Chinese threats in the
electromagnetic, air, and sea domains. Taiwan\'s armed forces could also
benefit from new training opportunities. Bilateral training exercises
and joint humanitarian missions with the U.S. military would give Taiwan
a much-needed shot in the arm. Modern wars are increasingly decided not
by brute force, but by brainpower. This can only be harnessed with
advanced training. [One of Taiwan\'s primary defense goals is to prepare
the island for the shock of a lightning war waged by the Peoples
Liberation Army (PLA).]{.underline} Doing so requires highly-motivated
personnel who are organized, trained, and equipped to meet an enemy
invasion campaign with overwhelming resistance. The asymmetry of size
and economy across the Taiwan Strait requires defense planners on the
island to harness every aspect of power, bringing a wide range of latent
capabilities to bear when needed. Taiwan\'s all-out defense strategy
calls for mobilizing the entire country, gearing-up every able-bodied
man and woman in support of anti-invasion operations. As Lauren Dickey
of Kings College London [points
out](https://jamestown.org/program/taiwans-han-kuang-exercises-training-for-a-chinese-invasion-one-drill-at-a-time/),
Taiwan\'s Ministry of National Defense (MND) is constantly honing its
ability to repulse Chinese invasion. Every year, MND conducts intensive
national and local-level military exercises, testing and sharpening
plans to defend the island in the event of enemy landings. It is
estimated that Taiwan will have approximately four weeks advanced
warning of a Chinese invasion. Given China\'s skill in the dark arts of
strategic deception, this cannot be taken for granted. Yet the vast
scale of the PLA\'s envisioned amphibious operations necessarily means
its offensive intentions would be foreshadowed. Warning signs would
include troop movements, reserve mobilization, industrial stockpiling,
military drills, media signaling, diplomatic messaging, and sabotage
against Taiwan. The most obvious and worrisome sign would be the
gathering of massive fleets of civilian and naval vessels at known
amphibious staging areas in southeast China. As all this was playing
out, Taiwan\'s president, her cabinet advisors, and parliamentary
leaders would debate their response options. They would weigh
intelligence pouring in from radars, satellites, listening posts, and
agents in China. Their most obvious option would be to increase
readiness levels and mobilize the island to gun-down an enemy attack. It
would not take long to mine the maritime lines of approach across the
Taiwan Strait, nor to fortify invasion beaches, ports, and airstrips. It
would take only slightly longer to man all inland key points like
bridges and power stations, and to evacuate non-essential personnel from
potential battle zones. But accomplishing this would require a colossal
workforce in the form of mobilized army reservists and contractors. For
this reason, Taiwan maintains the ability to mobilize up to two and a
half million men and nearly one million civil defense workers in just a
few days time. Tests of the emergency mobilization system are carried
out on a yearly basis at sites across Taiwan, Penghu, and the outer
islands (Kimen and Matsu). Their results are impressive. They indicate
that citizen-soldiers will muster at marshalling posts in extraordinary
numbers and at rapid speeds. Taiwan's all-out defense mobilization plan
entails more than just bringing latent military capabilities into
action. The Cabinet Office (Executive Yuan) and its subordinate
ministries such as the Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of the
Interior, and Ministry of Economic Affairs (among others) all play a
role in the integration of civil defense units for homeland defense. The
Way Forward: Taiwan\'s government and military (like the rest of
Taiwanese society) are far tougher than they get credit for. But they
can only do so much by themselves. **[[The Pentagon has a critical role
to play in assisting Taiwan maximize its war fighting
capabilities]{.mark}. [With America\'s help, Taiwan can make sure its
defense investments factor into Beijing\'s calculations and]{.mark},
hopefully, [prevent a future invasion from occurring]{.mark} in the
first place.]{.underline}** The RAND report suggests the establishment
of a joint working group, led on the U.S. side by an assistant secretary
of defense. Indeed, Taiwanese forces would benefit from new types of
professional military education and technical training in the United
States. American mentors could support Taiwan's continued transit to a
potent all-volunteer force and help create a more strategically focused
reserve force. **[[Taiwanese troops]{.mark} also [need regular and

same capabilities it is offering Japan and South Korea, including new
stealth fighter jets, missile defense batteries, and
destroyers.]{.underline} In addition, American companies should be
unchained by Washington, allowing them to compete for access to
Taiwan\'s Indigenous Defense Submarine program. Even more important than
firepower would be the huge morale boosting effects such material
support would have on recruitment and retention on the island―and the
powerful signal of purpose and resolve it would send to China.
[Taiwan\'s military has developed a solid defense plan and is
cultivating a force of professional warriors. **But the grave invasion

[richardbushiii](http://www.twitter.com/richardbushiii) As important as
the Six Assurances of 1982 remain for U.S.-Taiwan relations, however, it
is worth noting that governments make commitments to each other all the
time. They are the daily stuff of international relations, both when
they are observed and ignored. Assurances with a capital "A" are
certainly significant, but so are assurances with a lower-case "a."
Indeed, the Six Assurances of 1982 (capital "A") was only one effort by
Washington to convey assurance, with a lower-case "a," to Taipei. For a
long time, U.S. government officials did not say the two words "Six
Assurances." This was a Taiwan phrase, not a U.S. government one. When I
spoke on behalf of the U.S. government during my time as Chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, I would usually state the content of the
Assurances that were relevant for the situation at the time (for
example, Washington would not pressure Taipei to negotiate with
Beijing), rather than say the words "Six Assurances." To my mind,
actually, that content was more significant for US policy than the two
words themselves. My purpose here is not to elaborate on the Six
Assurances per se, but to clarify why countries convey assurances and
why countries need assurances. Both remain relevant to U.S.-Taiwan
relations. **[Many countries around the world depend on the commitments
of other countries for their survival. Small countries, in particular,
depend on the commitments of larger countries, as Taiwan has depended on
the United States since the early 1950s. For a commitment to be
effective as an instrument of policy, the party making the commitment
must be credible and the party receiving the commitment must have
confidence that the pledge means something.]{.underline}** Credibility
and confidence are reciprocal and reinforcing for good or ill, and
determine whether the underlying commitment is a valuable instrument of
policy. Now, it is a fact of life that even in the best of international
relationships, no commitment is perfect. There are always cobwebs of
doubt. Misunderstandings occur. Communication breaks down. Circumstances
change. Consequently, credibility and confidence---the linked,
reciprocal elements of commitment---weaken. Sustaining the credibility
of commitments and confidence in them requires regular assurance---with
a lower-case "a"---by the party extending the commitment. Regular
assurances are particularly common and necessary when the relationship
between the party extending the commitment and the one receiving it is
asymmetric. But, even in more balanced relationships, assurance with a
lower-case "a" happens all the time. We, in the public, just do not hear
about it. RELATED CONTENT [Reading the political winds: The case for

dependent on the United States for its security. For sure, it should
rely as much as possible on its own efforts, but it is still dependent
on America. That being the case, the credibility of the U.S. commitment
and the confidence that the leaders and people of Taiwan place in that
commitment is extremely important.]{.underline}** So is the need for
regular assurance (lower-case "a"). We know from history why Taiwan over
the long-term may have less-than-full confidence in American
commitments. **[The fundamental change in U.S.-China policy begun by
Richard Nixon in 1971, completed by Jimmy Carter in 1979, and elaborated
by Ronald Reagan in 1982, is the key case in point. Conversely, American
administrations have often preferred to state their commitments
unambiguously]{.underline}**. They wished to reduce the blank-check
problem and had to take the China factor into account. The result: U.S.
statements of commitment were not always fully credible in Taiwan's
eyes. Regular, mutual assurance was all the more required. **[This
situation began to change as Taiwan became a democracy. Washington
sincerely welcomed this transformation, even though U.S. officials had
gotten used to the relative predictability of the late authoritarian
period, when Taiwan's decisionmaking circle was very small and its
perceived choices very few. Simultaneous with democratization, through
the 1990s the PRC's military threat to Taiwan and the importance for the
United States to maintain the island's security
increased.]{.underline}** Democratization on Taiwan greatly widened the
range of debated options about the island's future. In response, first
President Lee Teng-hui and then President Chen Shui-bian took new
initiatives on cross-Strait policy. Whatever their motivation, from the
mid-1990s on Beijing came to believe that they each had the intention to
separate Taiwan from the state the international community calls China.
It accelerated the building of military capabilities by the PRC to deter
the separatism it perceived from Taiwan, and to punish Taiwan if its
deterrence failed. The United States became increasingly worried about
this new dynamic, which combined Taiwan policy initiatives, PRC
assessments of them, and PRC's coercive responses. Washington realized
that it could not take peace for granted. Correctly or incorrectly,
President Clinton and President Bush came to the conclusion that Taiwan,
through its actions, was putting the U.S. interest in peace and
stability at stake. Related Books [Hong Kong in the Shadow of

2016 How does this evolution relate to the question of mutual assurance
between the United States and Taiwan? I would argue that beginning with
the Six Assurances (capital "A") until the mid-1990s, Taiwan was more
the recipient of regular U.S. assurances (lower-case "a"), and properly
so. Those assurances were relatively credible and inspired Taiwan
confidence. But from the 1990s on, there was a growing need for Taiwan
to convey assurances to the United States, to credibly convince
Washington that it would not create risks for the United States and
undermine its interest in peace and stability. The "Four Noes and One
Without" (四不一沒有) in Chen Shui-bian's May 2000 inaugural address was
one effort to convey such assurance. From about August 2002, however,
the credibility of Chen's assurances and the confidence with which
Washington regarded them declined. I would further argue that mutual
assurance between Taipei and Washington was effective during the
administration of Ma Ying-jeou and so far under Tsai Ing-wen. Not only
has each side believed that the policies of the other conform to its
interests, but also the credibility of commitments and the confidence
with which they are received has been good. That bodes well for a stable
U.S.-Taiwan relationship.

#### U.S. arms sales are urgently key to halt Chinese invasions

The Taiwan question has long been in a thorn in the Chinese Communist
Party's (CCP) side. In the decades following the Shanghai communiqué,
the CCP's core strategic approach to Taiwan was to bide their time while
building up national strength. As Deng Xiaoping famously proclaimed, the
People's Republic of China (PRC) can wait 100 years to reunify with
Taiwan (also known as Republic of China, or ROC) if necessary.
**[Today's CCP appears to be operating within a much shorter time frame,
however. With China's rise to great power status, Beijing wields
unprecedented economic leverage over Taiwan and is increasingly
comfortable with flexing its military muscle overseas. XI Jingping is
"losing patience" with the defiant island off his southeastern coast,
which continues to rebuff Chinese reunification schemes premised on what
Xi calls a "one country, two systems" approach.]{.underline}** It is
unlikely that the CCP would seek an outright invasion and occupation of
Taiwan, given the drastic geopolitical risks that would entail. But as
East Asia scholars have frequently cautioned, the China-Taiwan
relationship is fraught with potential escalatory spirals that can
easily set the two sides on a path to unavoidable military conflict. 0

Sponsored Advertisement What are Taiwan's military capabilities, and how
would it defend itself against a Chinese offensive? Here is what we
found. Taiwan's capacity to defend its airspace against the might of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is one of the
foremost deciding factors in a prospective military conflict. For most
of the 20th century, Taiwan's security establishment was confident that
the superior training and equipment of the ROC air force was enough to
offset the PLAAF's vast numerical advantage. In 2019, those calculations
no longer apply. The PLAAF has emerged from its 1980's modernization
program with one of the most technically advanced air force rosters in
the world, supplementing a growing domestic jet fighter industry with a
total sum of just under one hundred modernized Russian Su-30MKK and
Su-35 fighters. Report Advertisement Meanwhile, the core of Taiwan's
fleet is still composed of US-made F-16A/B fighters that were procured
in the 1990's. Since then, Taipei attempted several times to purchase
upgraded F-16 C/D Block fighters. The Pentagon demurred until 2011, when
it instead offered a minor retrofit package for Taiwan's fleet of aging
F-16A/B jets. Even this watered-down contract sputtered and eventually
ground to a halt amid cost concerns. Taipei then briefly turned its
sights on procuring the F-35B, before concluding that the US fighter was
cost-inefficient and ill-suited for Taiwan's defense needs. **[It is
only in the past year that Taipei found a glimmer of hope on their
decades-long quest to modernize the Taiwanese air force. As per a 330
million dollar contract signed in late 2018 and reconfirmed last month,
the preponderance of Taiwan's F-16A/B fleet will be retrofitted to
become generation 4.5 F-16 Vipers. As opposed to the ill-fated F-16 C/D
deal, the F-16V upgrade promises to be a serious technical leap forward
for Taiwan's air force. The Viper boasts the best avionics package ever
seen on an F-16, while incorporating the expanded armament suites of
more recent F-16 Block revisions.]{.underline}** Report Advertisement
**[For the first time in well over a decade, Taiwan's air force would be
in a military position to at least contest Taiwanese airspace against
the PLAAF's J-10 and Su-30 fighters. There is, however, a large caveat:
the F-16V deal is not set in stone. Just as rapidly as Taiwan's military
fortunes are rising on the heels of a deteriorating US-China
relationship, so too can they suddenly collapse with a change in
Washington's geopolitical priorities.]{.underline}**

In this strategic context, [Taiwan's geographical location is of
particular importance to the US. The island controls the]{.underline}
sea lines of communication ([SLOCs]{.underline}) [extending from Japan
to Southeast Asia and s**erves as a check on China's maritime expansions
into the East and the S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**eas. [As China rises, Taiwan's strategic value to the
US will rise]{.underline} as well. The imperatives of the balance of
power will prompt Washington to give more thought to Taiwan's defense
needs. [Taiwan has substantial economic and military resources to
contribute to America's balancing efforts.]{.underline} For their own
strategic interests, "\[US policy makers\] will be inclined to back
Taiwan no matter what."16 Far from being a strategic liability, as
advocates of abandoning Taiwan believes, Taiwan is a strategic asset for
the US and its allies. During Cold War, Gen. Douglas MacArthur famously
referred to Taiwan as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier." Today, China's
strategic planners see Taiwan as an integral part of its future naval
power, as a way to break out of the encirclement of the First Island
Chain. [Beijing's acquisition of Taiwan would enhance China's naval
capabilities and give the PLA Navy greater strategic depth. It would
adversely affect Japan's maritime security]{.underline}, making it more
difficult for the US to defend its ally. [Taiwan's close location to the
Philippine Sea and the Luzon Strait would also provide the PLA Navy easy
access to the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina Sea, an area
fraught with territorial disputes.The changing international structure
will push Washington and Taipei into closer defense cooperation. The
security interests of both countries are compatible. **[It makes good
strategic sense for the US to help strengthen Taiwan's defense
capabilities to deter a Chinese attack. US arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}**, rather than being an unnecessary provocation to
China, as those in favor of abandoning Taiwan believe,
actually [**strengthen regional stability**. A basic requirement for
effective deterrence in the Taiwan Strait is that Taiwan
should]{.underline} at least [have the capabilities to withstand an
initial Chinese attack until the US has sufficient time to
respond.]{.underline} The arms sales not only fulfill a legal obligation
under the Taiwan Relations Act but also serve US strategic interests.
[A robust defense makes Taiwan less vulnerable to China's military
coercion and helps preserve regional peace. China is opposed to US arms
sales for the simple reason that a militarily weak Taiwan will be more
compliant to Beijing's demands. But a weakly defended Taiwan could temp
Chinese leadership to use the implied threat of force to coerce the
island into negotiations for unification. Once this process is
started]{.underline}, it would be difficult for the US to stay on the
sideline and watch a democracy being forced to accommodate an
authoritarian state under duress. For their part, the Chinese leaders
would find it difficult to back down without losing domestic
legitimacy. [A spiral of escalation would generate perilous dynamics and
threaten regional peace. Conversely, **a well-defended Taiwan would
reduce this source of dangerous miscalculation**]{.underline}, which
counterintuitively is also in China's interest.17

#### Disengaging from Taiwan causes China to pocket concessions and continue to pursue even more aggressive foreign policy

There are certain [**core issues** troubling the Sino-U.S.
relationship]{.underline} that [extend **far beyond** the **Taiwan**
Strait.]{.underline} Whether it is Beijing's assertiveness towards its
neighbors \[9\], some of whom, like Japan and the Philippines, are
treaty allies of the United States, or issues related to cyber-espionage
and human rights, the [challenges currently **testing the bilateral
relationship** are profound and numerous. China is a **revisionist
power**]{.underline} \[10\]---and its claims on the international system
do not end with Taiwan. [One **should not surmise**]{.underline},
therefore, [that Sino-U.S. strategic competition would abate were the
Taiwan issue to be resolved]{.underline}. Indeed, a growing body of work
in the strategic studies community has suggested that [Sino-U.S.
tensions are more structural than conjectural, and are the natural
result of]{.underline} the\[11\][friction]{.underline} \[11\] [that
traditionally occurs between rising and established powers]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [while some may assume that China's absorption of Taiwan
might provide]{.underline} at least [a symbolic first step]{.underline}
towards a more stable and peaceful relationship between Washington and
Beijing, [this hypothesis also appears]{.underline} somewhat
[untenable]{.underline}. To the contrary, an [American **abandonment**
of Taiwan might only succeed in **emboldening**, and **strengthening
hardline elements** within Beijing's leadership, by providing a
**material confirmation** of their **long-held desire** to see America
progressively retreat from the Indo-Pacific theater]{.underline}. Bonnie
Glaser and Nancy Bernkopf Tucker have expressed their concerns \[12\]
over such a development, cautioning that [A decision to **jettison**
Taiwan, or even cut back significantly on U.S. support, would prove to
an **increasingly confident China** that Washington has become **weak,
vacillating and unreliable**]{.underline}...Accordingly, [a U.S.
**sacrifice of Taiwan**, while gratifying, could not thoroughly slake a
continuing need for Beijing to demonstrate its power. Indeed, the
sacrifice might promote new appetites and necessitate fresh efforts to
satisfy that need.]{.underline}

future and the extent of the self-governing island's dependence upon US
military power. The panel of experts said the United States should not
break with nearly 50 years of practice and challenge Beijing's one-China
policy, a move that would inflame tensions across the Taiwan Strait or,
worse, precipitate military force from mainland China. The report said:
"Washington must maintain a strong and credible military presence in the
Western Pacific to convince Beijing that the United States still has
serious military options," despite China's rapid military expansion and
development of advanced weapons.]{.underline}** US position on Taiwan
will not waver, regardless of midterm results The report, "Course

the gulf in military forces between Beijing and Taipei and said it was

It has suspended official exchanges with Taiwan, staged a series of war
games around the island and wooed away five of its allies since Tsai
Ing-wen, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, was
elected president in 2016 and refused to accept the one-China principle.
Beijing insisted that cross-strait exchanges could only be resumed after
the Tsai government accepted that Taiwan was a part of China. The panel,
which included Susan Shirk, a former US deputy assistant secretary of
state in president Bill Clinton's administration, and Orville Schell,
director of the non-profit Asia Society's Centre on US-China Relations,
called for greater dialogue between all parties concerned with Taiwan's
future and empowerment of Taipei on the international stage. US\$330

It must allow high-level official visits between the US and Taiwan,
explore further trade and investment liberalisation with Taiwan, and
continue to push for increased participation for Taiwan in international
organisations and activities for which statehood is not a requirement.

militarily, commercially and diplomatically across the Indo-Pacific

and members of Congress were good for Taiwanese morale, "they certainly
would fuel concerns from Beijing, which might further increase its
pressure on Taiwan." Republican US senators want to invite Taiwan's Tsai
to address Congress Last week, US senators asked House of
Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to invite Tsai to address a joint
meeting of Congress, an invitation that would anger Beijing as China and
the US seek to negotiate their way out of a messy and costly dispute
over trade tariffs. Taiwan said there were no plans for such a visit.

#### Abandoning Taiwan crushes US primacy in Asia -- that decks our alliances and sparks economic collapse 

**Twining 13** (Daniel Twining is senior fellow for Asia at the German
Marshall Fund of the United States. He previously served as a member of
the secretary of state's Policy Planning Staff and as Senator John
McCain's foreign policy advisor, "The Taiwan Linchpin."

The key to the alliance [A related component of the **strategic
geography** of]{.underline} Japan-[**Taiwan relations** is the role
relations play in facilitating **regional access** for the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, [which remains the primary security provider in
East Asia and the Pacific.]{.underline} **[[American ability to project
power in]{.mark} East and Southeast [Asia]{.mark},]{.underline}** as
currently constituted, **[[is dependent on allied control
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** Japan and **[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The largest American forward-deployed troop concentration, on Okinawa,
is as close to Taiwan as to the Japanese home islands. The United
States' responsibility for the defense of Japan invests the southeastern
approaches to the Japanese home islands with considerable strategic
importance; similarly, U.S. ability to project power to defend Taiwan is
dependent on the American military's ability to operate from Okinawa. In
short, U.S. bases in Japan reinforce the continued credibility of
America's military commitment to Taiwan's defense, while a friendly
Taiwan helps secure the southeastern approaches to the Japanese home
islands --- the most likely route of any airborne or naval assault on
America's closest Asian ally. U.S. plans for the defense of Taiwan
require access to bases, logistics, rear-area support, intelligence,
communication, and supply hubs in Japan. It is therefore unlikely that a
U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan would relieve Japan of the imperative to
actively support, defend, and perhaps even fight with American forces.
It was this realization, following the exposure of a lack of clarity in
Japan over its role in supporting the United States during the Taiwan
Strait crisis of 1995--96, that led Washington and Tokyo to more clearly
define the defense of Taiwan as a core area of alliance cooperation.7
[Chinese control of Taiwan would, among other things, sever the sea
lanes than connect Japan and its ally, the United States]{.underline}.
**[[Hostile control of Taiwan]{.mark} which enabled projection of naval
and air power from its territory [would dramatically erode the]{.mark}

[become]{.mark} **less defensible** and more [vulnerable to]{.mark}
embargo or [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[The ability of the United
States Navy to secure]{.mark} the [sea lanes]{.mark} around Japan [would
be called into question]{.mark}.** This would raise doubts not only
about the defense of Japan, but the security of the maritime routes
connecting Japan to the economies of Southeast Asia, India, the Persian
Gulf, and Central Asia]{.underline}. [Okinawa serves not only as the
frontline defense of Japan, but as the hub of American power projection
into Southeast Asia. **[Hostile control of Taiwan would geographically
sever the]{.mark} primary [base of U.S. expeditionary forces in Asia
from]{.mark} strategic regions like [the]{.mark} [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea and the Indo-Malaysian
archipelago.**]{.underline} [Asian states that have sought closer
security ties with the United States, including Indonesia and Vietnam,
might **reconsider** their strategic choices should Taiwan move from
being a facilitator to an obstacle to U.S. power projection in maritime
Southeast Asia. **[The freedom of maneuver that U.S.]{.mark} air and

basis for American primacy]{.mark} and the prosperity it has
underwritten in this vast region --- [would be meaningfully
constrained]{.mark} [should]{.mark} the air and maritime commons around
[Taiwan come under contestation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In short, [the

Other [abandonists, who are more pessimistic about China\'s rise,
consider US promises to Taiwan too costly to keep]{.underline}.
Eschewing the rosy picture of Sino-US cooperation, they warn instead of
intensifying competition, and set their sights on the challenges of the
future, arguing that China\'s ascendency will eventually spell US
decline and Taiwanese surrender.11 (link is external) [If the key
presumption of these pessimists is American retreat from the
Asia-Pacific, then abandoning Taiwan is not so much a policy or a
calculated choice for the US government as it is an
inevitability.]{.underline} [If the pessimists' aim is to shape the
trajectory of China\'s ascendency to US advantage, however, then
**abandoning Taiwan would be a mistake**.]{.underline} Historically, the
United States has consistently prevented any power it sees as
potentially hostile from controlling Asia. The likelihood of a Sino-US
crisis triggered by maritime disputes will increase as long as
Washington finds it necessary to maintain a substantial military
presence and support to its allies in the region.12 (link is external)
[Given its location at a strategic crossroads of the Asia-Pacific**,
Taiwan will remain an indispensable part of the US regional security
architecture**]{.underline}. US regional allies and partners, such as
Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asian countries, thus also have much at
stake in Washington\'s continuing commitment to Taiwan. [Cutting Taiwan
loose will **not only weaken US credibility as a reliable partner**, but
will also enhance the PRC\'s ability to **project power**, should the
island fall into its orbit]{.underline}. The fate of Taiwan\'s autonomy
is a litmus test of China\'s wider intentions as well as US resolution
and commitment to the Asia-Pacific. [The desire of both the optimistic
and pessimistic abandonists for the United States to avoid unnecessary
confrontation with China, and to mitigate the unfolding security dilemma
in the region, is constructive. But Taiwan is not the right card to
play. Abandoning Taiwan would create conditions **detrimental** both to
the Sino-US relationship and to regional stability.]{.underline} As
Washington strives to build a constructive relationship with Beijing,
Taipei has also been doing its part to make peace with its long-term
rival. The cross-Strait detente could, to some extent, facilitate
Sino-US collaboration by mitigating a contentious issue in their
bilateral relationship. Taipei\'s recent policies have been conducive to
regional peace and prosperity, and deserve Washington\'s support.

Myth #1: Taiwan Is an Obstacle to Better U.S.-China Relations

[Glaser and others]{.underline} who espouse the benefits of a U.S.-China
grand bargain [allege that the unresolved question of Taiwanese
independence has impeded healthy U.S.-China relations. To test this
assertion, it is important to consider the reality of recent
China-Taiwan interactions]{.underline}.

The issues of [Taiwan's disputed status and U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline} remain perhaps the most outstanding problems between
the United States and China. Still, even these issues **[no longer
impede U.S.-China relations]{.underline}**. The question of Taiwanese
independence emerged in the 1990s with the nation's transition to
democracy. As the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
gained control over Taiwan in subsequent elections, then-President Chen
Shui-bian amplified Taiwan's calls for independence. The 2005 passage of
the Anti-Secession Law\* in China served as a sharp response to Taiwan's
ambitions for independence. Meanwhile, former President George W. [Bush
clarified the U.S. position of "strategic ambiguity" over]{.underline}
the [Taiwan]{.underline} issue with a powerful proclamation: The United
States would not want to see Taiwan provoke China, but the United States
would help defend Taiwan if China were to lose its patience with Taiwan
and use force to achieve unification with the island. This statement
made it clear that the United States did not support either formal
Taiwanese independence or forceful unification. This policy position
effectively stabilized the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. [Since then,
no further attempts have been made to upend the balance between China
and Taiwan]{.underline}.

Nor should U.S. arms sales to Taiwan be regarded as a serious barrier to
U.S.-China relations. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 stipulates that
the United States will provide Taiwan with arms of a defense nature.
Although China often uses the United States' periodic decision to sell
arms to Taiwan as a political ploy to suspend the Chinese military's
contact with the United States and stir up nationalistic sentiments, the
issue needs to be put into perspective. While all arms are technically
offensive in nature, [the quantity and quality of the weapons Taiwan
receives from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [do little
Taiwan's offensive capabilities]{.underline}. For example, Taiwan
purchases short-range fighter jets, air defense systems, and
older-generation weapons.

In addition, [U.S. authorization to sell arms to Taiwan differs from the
actual delivery of weapon systems. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has declined to provide the quality of weapons
that Taiwan has requested from time to time]{.underline}. Moreover,
Taiwan's legislature has often failed to appropriate the funds necessary
to purchase the quantity of weapons requested.

Finally, [China's periodic suspensions of its military contacts with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have failed to inflict
significant damage on U.S.-China relations and relations are regularly
quietly restored once the political storm subsides. Beijing understands
that Taiwan's weaponry does not pose a serious threat to mainland
China's military]{.underline}. Bearing this in mind, it seems evident
that [U.S. arms sales to Taiwan act as mere political pretense for
China's antagonistic behavior and are not serious
obstacles]{.underline}.

In fact, [the past several decades have produced a **relatively stable
economic and political equilibrium** between China and
Taiwan]{.underline}. Most recently, [the 2008 election of]{.underline}
President [Ma]{.underline} Ying-jeou [has ushered in an era of
**unprecedented China-Taiwan cooperation**. Economic integration,
highlighted by a 2010 bilateral trade agreement, has inextricably linked
Beijing and Taipei]{.underline}. In fact, [the health of Taiwan's
economy relies on revenue from Chinese trade]{.underline}. According to
2014 Chinese statistics, trade volume between the two nations totaled
more than 200 billion dollars. Taiwan also exports most of its goods to
China and enjoys a huge trade surplus. [Yearly trends indicate that the
economic bonds between the two nations are getting **even
stronger**]{.underline}: From 2014 to 2015, trade between the two
nations increased 16.7 per cent.

#### The plan doesn't solve US-China relations AND independently sparks massive political backlash that turns the advantage 

**Rigger 11** (Shelley Rigger, Brown Professor and chair of political
science at Davidson College, November 29, 2011. "Why giving up Taiwan
will not help us with China."

**[[No Silver Bullet for US-China Woes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Even if it
were true that Sino-American tensions [could]{.underline} be **[melted
away]{.underline}** [[with a **single policy change in
Washington**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the United States should still
continue to support Taiwan to maintain the credibility of its alliances
and uphold its commitment to democracy as a desirable and feasible goal
for developing nations. But, **[in reality]{.underline}**, [[ending US
defense assistance to]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[Taipei]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to produce]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[salutary effects]{.underline}]{.mark} the critics of current US
policy anticipate. [Such a change]{.underline} would indeed delight
Beijing; however, it [would create new problems just as intractable as
the old ones but less familiar and potentially even more
challenging]{.underline}. [The point of departure for critics of
America's existing Taiwan policy is their shared belief that ending
security assistance to Taiwan would **improve US-China
relations**]{.underline}. As Freeman puts it, "[The kind of long-term
**relationship**]{.underline} [of friendship]{.underline} [and
**cooperation**]{.underline} [China and America want with each other is
**incompatible**]{.underline} with our emotionally fraught differences
over the Taiwan issue. These differences propel mutual hostility and the
sort of ruinous military rivalry between the two countries that has
already begun. We are coming to a point at which we can no longer
finesse our differences over Taiwan. We must either resolve them or live
with the increasingly adverse consequences of our failure to do
so."\[10\] As a syllogism, this argument makes sense: Beijing believes
Taiwan should be unified with the mainland, and it views US security
assistance to Taiwan as the primary reason it is not. Because
unification is a core issue for the PRC, leaders in Beijing cannot
ignore or overlook US intervention; they must constantly challenge it.
[Thus, if the United States ended its security assistance to Taiwan, the
biggest irritant in US-China relations would disappear]{.underline}. In
practice, unfortunately, [[there is **no guarantee** that a change in US
policy toward Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} [[would
**instantly**]{.underline}]{.mark} or automatically
[[end]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or **even significantly
reduce**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the [tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} the
Taiwan issue creates [[in **Sino-American
relations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ending security assistance to Taiwan
would raise expectations in China without removing the existing
obstacles to peaceful unification. It likely would provoke panic in
Taiwan, but it would not make the Taiwanese people any more enthusiastic
about unification. On the contrary, the more vulnerable and threatened
the Taiwanese people felt, the harder it would be for them to consider
China's overtures rationally. For decades, the United States has
justified arms sales to Taiwan on the grounds that Taipei can negotiate
with Beijing more effectively from a position of strength than of
weakness. It is easy to dismiss this logic as a rationalization, but as
Randall Schriver said, "In what other instance involving a negotiation
is the weaker party better off? . . . Historically, what you find is
where there is equal power---or, at least, credible deterrent
power---you get better outcomes." Neither Beijing nor Taipei is well
served by a negotiating process that leads to a bad deal, including one
Taiwanese citizens cannot accept. Successfully pressuring Taiwan's
negotiators into accepting a deal might seem like a victory for Beijing,
but if Taiwan's domestic politics make it impossible to implement the
deal, the long-term result might be worse than no deal at all.
**[[Ending]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[US defense assistance
to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**---whether by
repealing the Taiwan Relations Act or by simply declining to provide
defensive equipment to Taiwan's armed forces---would not "ripen" Taiwan
for peaceful unification or obviate the rationale the United States has
historically followed regarding Taiwan. It [[would]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, **[[intensify]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[the debate
over]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Taiwan]{.mark} policy]{.underline}**
[[within the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. [[Taiwan]{.mark} still [has]{.mark}
**[many US friends]{.mark}** and supporters, and many foreign policy
experts would **question a decision to change course**]{.underline}. The
policy changes Gilley, Glaser, Freeman, and Owens recommend would
stimulate a debate over China policy at a time when negative attitudes
toward the PRC already are on the rise. [[The]{.mark} **[last
thing]{.mark}** [Sino-American relations need is an **acrimonious,
politically charged debate** in Washington over]{.mark} policy toward
**China and [Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In sum, [[changing America's
Taiwan policy could]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[easily
induce]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[poisonous

[relationship are **profound and numerous**. China is a **revisionist
power**---and its claims on the international system **do not end with
Taiwan**. One should not surmise]{.underline}, therefore, [that
Sino-U.S. strategic competition would abate were the Taiwan issue to be
resolved]{.underline}. Indeed, [a growing body of work in the strategic

result** of the friction that traditionally occurs between rising and
established powers]{.underline}.

[Points of friction in U.S.-China relations abound---from **cyber
espionage** and **human rights** to **trade disputes** and **financial
governance**. Abandoning Taiwan will **not** stop Chinese **military
modernization**, **antiaccess/area denial development**, or the
targeting of U.S. bases in **Japan** and **South Korea** with Chinese

[has **numerous reasons** for conducting surveillance and freedom of
navigation operations, so those activities Glaser identifies as
irritants to China **would not end**, even if Taiwan were no longer a
subject of disagreement]{.underline}. Foreign policy ambition in Beijing
has outgrown the 1950s and 1990s cross-strait crises; Chinese internal
debates tend to paint the United States as a global competitor,
benchmark U.S. global capabilities, and derive legitimacy from
contrasting Chinese political values with "Western" or "universal"
values.12 Glaser does not mention Chinese efforts at building up
alternative institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,
Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, Boao
Forum for Asia, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or China using
issues of historical animosity to drive a wedge between Japan and South
Korea. He thus underestimates the apparent Chinese strategy of not
directly confronting the United States globally, while attempting to
dilute U.S. alliances in Asia, pursuing a Chinese-centered regional
architecture, and changing the status quo in maritime areas without
going so far as to trigger conflict or a coherent balancing coalition.13

[Glaser]{.underline} nonetheless sees benefits in accommodating China on
Taiwan. He [opines that current Taiwan policy could precipitate a

[S]{.underline}tates [has **much greater economic interdependence** with
China than it did with the Soviet Union and even though China is more

and winning the "hearts and minds of 1.3 billion people" (p. 71). [But
the sales have been **defensive in nature** and **limited in
scale**]{.underline}.9 Although the United States' "six assurances" to
Taiwan specify that arms sales not be suspended as a result of
negotiations with Beijing, such [sales have been slowed by U.S.
bureaucratic considerations and budgetary debates in
Taipei]{.underline}. Glaser does not mention how Barack

Is a military conflict between China and the United States possible in
the future?

[There is almost never a time when people do not worry about war between
major powers. The history here is not]{.underline} a [happy]{.underline}
one. [But there are good reasons to expect **a better outcome** in the
21st century]{.underline}---as long as both sides are alert and careful.

[The stakes are **much too high** for either Beijing or Washington to
expect direct military confrontations. Two-way trade and investment are
**quite high**]{.underline}. China holds almost \$1.2 trillion in
American debt. [By contrast, during the Cold War, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had virtually **no economic
ties** with the Soviet Union---and both sides still went **out of their
way** to avoid war because of the dangers of escalation into nuclear
war. The nightmare of nuclear war hangs over the Chinese-American
relationship today. It is clear neither side wants to come **anywhere
near** this ultimate danger]{.underline}.

None of this is to say that both sides will not continue to build up
their military capability. No country is adding to its military punch
faster than China. But it is still far behind the United States in
usable military capability, that is, force that can be applied
effectively and decidedly in various situations. Chinese military
strength is limited almost entirely to lands and seas bordering its own
territory. The United States is still the only global military power.

And [it is **difficult to see** what Beijing might calculate is worth a
war or even **the risk of war**]{.underline}. It has boundary disputes
with Vietnam, the Philippines and others in the South China Sea, and
with Japan up north. Troubles should be expected there, and China will
certainly be testing Washington\'s will in both places. [Chinese
leaders]{.underline}, however, [continue to focus on their nation\'s
**economic development**, and war would certainly **set that

Firstly, White inevitably addresses the issue of potential U.S. military
assistance to Taiwan in the case of Chinese attack:

> Even more worryingly, this reality does not yet seem to have sunk in
> in Washington, where leaders still talk boldly about their willingness
> to stand by Taiwan without seriously considering what that might mean
> in practice. Any US effort to support Taiwan militarily against China
> would be almost certain to escalate into a full-scale US-China war and
> quite possibly a nuclear exchange. That would be a disaster for

The last sentence is just horrible. It could very well read like this:
"Please, everyone who just happen to be subject of territorial desire of
a stronger state, do us good and surrender already, obviously it is
better for you anyway. Sincerely yours, concerned third party." Now
somehow I can't understand why White's compatriots were so stubbornly
rejecting to become part of the glorious Japanese empire more than 60
years ago. It must be some exception from the rule, I suppose.

That is not what puzzles me though. Instead it is the other claim. [Why
so many people assume that potential conflict between China and the U.S.
has nuclear potential?]{.underline} For one, [**I do not think it
does**. Neither territory of the two nuclear weapon-armed actors would
be subject to an invasion from the other side, nor would either of them
face total defeat threatening the very existence of one's statehood.
Granted, losing would be hard hit for either of the two (and Taiwan),
but it would not be as **nearly as bad** as mutual nuclear holocaust.
**Live to fight another day** is in this scenario always better option,
Taiwan's importance notwithstanding]{.underline}.

### 1NC---No Militarization

#### No space mil-Code of Conduct negotiations get Russia and China on board

**Lele 12 --** Dr. Ajey Lele works at the Institute For Defence Studies
and Analyses (IDSA), a New Delhi-based think tank on security issues. He
is a postgraduate in physics and has a doctorate in international
relations. His research focus is on strategic technologies and WMD
related issues. He has several publications to his credit. (7-16-2012,
"Space Code of Conduct: the Challenges Ahead", The Space Review,
http://thespacereview.com/article/2119/1) RaPa

Various international regimes, mostly under the United Nation's (UN)
aegis, are found today to be effectively dealing with issues ranging
from the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons to
small arms and landmines to maritime and environmental security. Outer
space is one arena where some such (limited) efforts have been made in
the past, most notably the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. All such
mechanisms are limited in scope because many of them deal only with a
particular issue in the outer space arena, with no mechanism available
to address these issues in holistic manner. [With a rapid increase in
activities in outer space, and with the prospect of private sector
taking a major role in this arena, it has become important to develop
new sets of rules to complement the existing frameworks dealing with
outer space issue]{.underline}s. In view of this, on June 6, 2012,
[the]{.underline} European Union [(EU) launched a multilateral
diplomatic process to discuss and negotiate an "International Code of
Conduct (CoC) for Outer Space]{.underline}" with the aim to ensure
security, safety, and sustainability of all outer space activities. [The
code is likely to be adopted by 2013. This CoC is expected to generate
greater clarity about space activities. The CoC is mainly about
undertaking measures that bring more transparency in outer space
activities through a series of voluntary disclosures by the states
regaing their intentions in space]{.underline}. The states are also
expected to remain committed towards limiting the creation of space
debris. Adherence to this code is voluntary. During coming months many
observers expect hectic lobbying to garner additional support (or
opposition) for this suggested mechanism. Space negotiations are going
to happen in a changed geopolitical atmosphere than that of the Cold War
era. It is important to remember that there are no absolutes in the
arena of arms control and disarmament related issues; it all depends on
which hat one wishes to put on. Based on some recent debates, political
statements, and writings on the CoC issue, [it appears that two groups
are emerging, with the US and EU as backers of the code]{.underline}
and, most likely, Russia and China as the resisters. In 2008, Russia and
China jointly proposed an international treaty called the "Prevention of
the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space Treaty" (PPWT), which would be a
legally-binding accord banning the weaponization of space. However, no
major progress has been made to win support for this treaty. Under these
circumstances, Russia and China would probably react to this CoC with
the PPWT. Amongst the other spacefaring nations, [Japan is supporting
this ide]{.underline}a and India is yet to disclose its position.
Notionally, any new idea proposed regarding space safety and security
efforts needs to be welcomed, and from that viewpoint states should
consider participating in the proposed CoC deliberations. In particular,
other spacefaring states like Iran and Israel, and states making
significant investments in space arena like Brazil, Nigeria, and South
Korea, should play an important role in the process of finalizing the
CoC. On the issue of nonproliferation efforts, states like Iran and
North Korea mostly have a "diverse" view from the rest of the world. It
would be welcome if such states would also participate in this
negotiating process. It is important to note that space is different
than other "standard" arms control and disarmament approaches formulated
in the 20th century. Such discussions are more about sustainability and
encouraging more states to benefit from this technology than about
preventing proliferation of any technology or weapon. [In the space
arena there exists a possibility that debate could follow a similar
pattern as happened in past, particularly in regards to nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons negotiations.]{.underline} Also, while
some have compared the space legal regime with the "laws of sea" regime,
there is a need to delink any such mindset in this regard. [It is
important to learn from the past experiences, but there is a need to
avoid getting trapped into the similar disarmament
discourses.]{.underline} As in the past, the self-styled disarmament
advocates are expected to view the issues related to space mostly with a
utopian vision, and **[there is a need to guard against views that are
extremely idealistic in nature but do not match up with geopolitical
realities.]{.underline}** Space negotiations are going to happen in a
changed geopolitical atmosphere than that of the Cold War era. The last
two decades have seen a gradual change in the geopolitical and
geostrategic landscape of the world. States like China, India, and
Brazil have emerged as major economic powers while the economic
stability of the EU is rapidly declining. [The US still has its
superpower status, but with shrinking influence. All this indicates that
the power balance is showing signs of realignment.]{.underline} The
success of the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)
has been viewed as cornerstone for the global nuclear non-proliferation
regime. However, it is important to understand that this treaty suffers
from an inherent discriminatory mechanism by which it allows five
nuclear-weapon states to possess nuclear weapons, giving unfair
advantage over other states. Even the most successful treaty mechanism,
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), has witnessed non-compliance.
Both the Russia and the US have failed to meet the April 29, 2012,
deadline to destroy their stocks, showing disrespect to the treaty
provisions. They have cited technical and financial reasons for this
failure, and it may take an additional decade to fully destroy their
stockpiles. Also, the pattern visible with the climate change debate
indicates that there are major differences of opinions among developed
and developing nations. [In regards to issues related to space debris
already opinions have been expressed that the "polluters" must
pay.]{.underline} The most obvious contrast in regards to a number of
past negotiations and present space negotiations is that the grouping of
P-5 nations is not expected to be on the same side of the fence. [The
basic problem is about the differences in regards to the issues related
to missile defense among the US, Russia, and China. Also, rhetorical
views have mostly been expressed by the major powers in respect of
counter-space measures and space-based weapons, although their exact
intentions are still unclear.]{.underline} It is important for
second-rung spacefaring nations, and other nations keen to develop their
space capital, to view the present process of negotiations within the
backdrop of above realities. Understanding the difficulties in reaching
any globally accepted solution in the space arena, the CoC offers an
alternative model as a voluntary and non-binding mechanism. A
[simplistic way to look at this proposal is that at least some beginning
has been made and that should be welcomed]{.underline}. However, we need
to have deeper debate on this issue. The main question that many nations
should ask themselves is: "Just because a few states in world have
differences of opinion on outer space issues, should the rest of the
world allow them alone to have their say?" Recently, a private company
successfully sent a robotic craft to the International Space Station.
Some organizations and governments have started making investments into
the development of spaceports. These and other developments make it
obvious that industry will have a major stake in the future. The past
experience, particularly from the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC),
indicates that in order to preserve the interests of industry, states
normally shy away from getting bound by any legally binding mechanisms.
In the space arena, it is also important to protect the legitimate
interests of the industry; however, it is also important to have proper
checks and balances in place. [In the interest of space security and
sustainability it is important to lobby for a stronger CoC that binds
nations to adhere to its provisions. The proposed CoC is also about
transparency and confidence building measures. Therefore, it is also
necessary to debate on the nature of "transparency" currently being
observed in the space arena]{.underline}. ASAT (anti-satellite)
technologies have been at the center of this debate for the last five
years. In January 2007, China destroyed one of its own weather
satellites at an altitude of 850 kilometers, creating a significant
amount of debris. The US, meanwhile, smashed its own defunct satellite
at an altitude of 240 kilometers in February 2008. The Chinese test was
a surprise to the rest of the world, while the US had announced its
intentions beforehand. Both these tests could be viewed as opportunistic
tests, when the states took the chance of converting a nonfunctional and
falling satellite as a target to indirectly demonstrate their ASAT
capabilities. Last month, X-37B, the mysterious US spaceplane, returned
from space after 15 months in orbit. This was second such mission, and
the US is not ready to disclose any of its intentions in this regard.
There is also a veil of secrecy to some degree surrounding China's
ongoing efforts to develop a space station. [All this indicates that
some states are not keen to discuss every activity they undertake in
space. If this is what transparency is all about, then what is the use
of joining a CoC that would have no control over a state's erratic
behavior in space? The CoC should expect openness and transparency in
the information provided by the states in regards to their existing and
future space agendas]{.underline}. However, the track record of another
voluntary and non-binding mechanism in missile nonproliferation, The
Hague Code of Conduct (HCoC), is not very encouraging. The strategic and
business interests of big players in the space arena are likely to
supersede their CoC commitments. For this purpose it is important to
include some kind of accountability mechanisms into the CoC. [**The
negotiations of a space CoC scheduled for this October offers an
opportunity to undertake serious negotiations on outer space issues for
the first time in decade**s. This opportunity should not be wasted. In
the interest of space security and sustainability it is important to
lobby for a stronger CoC that binds nations to adhere to its
provisions.]{.underline}

#### Even in the absolute worst-case scenario China can't attack US space assets

satellites? Let's examine the possibilities: Attacking Navigation
Satellites [You need a launch pad to attack a target in deep

three]{.underline} of these pads. This really restricts China's
offensive capabilities in space. [Assuming that China devotes all its

16]{.underline} satellites[. At the current time, with 32 functioning
navigation satellites, that would still leave 16 satellites still
working]{.underline}. Over a period of years, the debris from those
collisions would represent a significant threat to more than those
satellites immediately attacked. They would pass, time and time again,
through the belts of debris that resulted from the interceptions.
However, it would probably take longer than the military conflict China
initiated with these attacks before additional satellites were destroyed
by subsequent collisions. Usually, there are about nine GPS satellites
over China at any given time. [If China somehow managed]{.underline} to
destroy all of these, [it could eliminate America's use of
precision-guided munitions---for a few hours]{.underline}, until the
orbits of other GPS satellites take them over the Taiwan Straits. Quite
quickly, the constellation's other 23 satellites would fill in the gap
due to their normal orbital movement. Even if it destroyed 16
satellites, China could still only interrupt GPS over the Straits for
about eight hours. During the other 16 hours there would be the four or
more satellites present over the target area for bombing runs, unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) flights, and ship tracking. This pattern of eight
hours off followed by 16 hours when GPS could be used would be repeated
every day until new satellites are launched. This outage would certainly
cause difficulties; GPS not only guides American precision bombs -- it
helps pilot UAV spy planes, and monitor ships. US casualties might
increase , with air crews forced to fly missions during daylight hours
-- and conduct some of the \"dull, dirty, and dangerous\" missions now
flown by robotic planes. [It's a situation no American commander would
want to face. But it would not be a catastrophic one. And it would not
eliminate precision weaponry, UAVs, or any other American activity that
depends on GPS.]{.underline} Keep in mind, this is the worst of the
worst-case scenarios. [It is highly unlikely that China could remove all
the satellites over the conflict area at the same time. After all,
attacking 16 satellites, all in different orbits with ASATs launched on
just four different rockets involves some fairly complex orbital
maneuvers.]{.underline} A much more likely scenario is that, at best,
China could destroy four GPS satellites in the initial wave followed
roughly seven hours later by four more, a third wave at roughly 45
minutes after that, and the final wave two hours later. Thus, the GPS
attack is spread over ten hours and never eliminates all the satellites
visible over the area of conflict at the same time. This Chinese attack
on US navigation satellites would not eliminate or even significantly
degrade the US's ability use precision-guided munitions..

#### No impact---only ground forces matter

Return now to the three potential roles for space weapons: protecting
existing satellites, denying the hostile use of space, and projecting
force worldwide. It is difficult to identify a space weapon that is more
attractive than its competing terrestrial alternatives. Offensive [space
weapons face]{.underline} inherent [limitations, including long
distances to targets and high energy]{.underline} requirements, which
suggest in many circumstances a non-space-based alternative, such as
forward-deployed missiles and conventional ICBMs. In nearly every case,
[space weapons are more complex, more costly, and less effective than
Earth-based weapons]{.underline}. Moreover, we have seen that [there are
a number of ways to render military space systems
inoperable]{.underline} [without destroying the satellites
themselves]{.underline}, [such as attacks on their ground
stations]{.underline}. In such cases, space weapons would be rendered
useless. We have also argued that satellites could be better protected
with redundant systems that would mitigate attacks or with stand-in
capabilities provided by UAVs or balloons above the battlefield. [As for
denying adversaries the use of space, this may likewise be more readily
achieved by less expensive terrestrial alternatives]{.underline}, such
as electromagnetic jamming and the temporary blinding of adversaries\'
reconnaissance systems. The United States would prefer a world in which
it alone had military space systems, weapons in space, and antisatellite
capability. However, such a world never existed and never will. Already,
several states and consortia have autonomous space-launch capabilities,
among them Russia, China, Ukraine, Japan, India, and the European Union.
Such groups would likely respond if the United States took a first step
toward weaponizing space.

### 2NC---No Space Militarization (Generic)

#### The United States's commitment to transparency measures and TCBM's is critical to ushering in a new era of peaceful space development with new space-faring nations

RaPa

The past two decades have witnessed a fairly dramatic intensification of
space-related activities. Beyond the exploration and exploitation of
space by the U.S., Russia and Europe, the world has witnessed Asia's
accelerated development of space capabilities and activities. [It is now
universally understood that space-based assets offer a wide spectrum of
critical civilian, commercial, and military-related services, many of
them essential. Space assets (including ground-based) are, therefore,
properly regarded as vital infrastructure for governments and the
private sector and their disruption would have far-reaching economic,
political, and geostrategic consequences.]{.underline} A growing amount
of orbital space debris remains one of the key challenges for a safe
space environment. In addition to the perils of space debris, the
growing number of space-faring nations and satellite applications are
increasing demand for limited radiofrequency spectrum and orbital slots.
These are indispensable for space operations and securing them is a
prerequisite for space operators in designing any new space mission. The
technical ease with which both intentional and unintentional frequency
interference can occur will remain a significant space security concern
for the foreseeable future. [The U.S. views space as increasingly
contested (i.e. confronted by a range of natural and man-made threats
that could potentially deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt, or destroy space
assets and their supporting infrastructure), including threats to space
systems from an increasing number of state and non-state actors which
have developed, or are configuring, counterspace
capabilities.]{.underline} Europe has also recognized the need to
protect space infrastructure, including its acknowledgement that space
security is a global challenge requiring cooperation with the U.S. and
other international partners. [Due to the delicate nature of the space
environment and the world's growing dependence on space assets, careless
or malevolent behaviour by any actor in space can damage the operating
capabilities of all space-faring nations. Accordingly, the global space
community seeks to require that all nations which exercise the right to
use and explore space conduct their activities responsibly and
prudently. Active discussions are also underway concerning how best to
strengthen the current framework governing space
activities.]{.underline} Given these realities, this article describes
current efforts to develop multilateral governance regimes for outer
space with special attention to Europe's draft International Code of
Conduct for Outer Space Activities. It also touches upon the essential
roles played by the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and transparency
and confidence-building measures (TCBMs) in developing shared
behavioural norms. International Framework for Space Activities The
legal core for the conduct of space activities is embodied in five space
treaties (i.e. the Outer Space Treaty of 1976, the Rescue Agreement of
1968, the Liability Convention of 1975, the Registry Convention of 1975,
and the Moon Agreement of 1979) and five sets of legal principles
adopted by the UN General Assembly. These governance principles include
broadcasting via satellites, remote satellite observations of Earth, and
general standards for the safe use of nuclear power sources in space.
There are likewise a number of resolutions relating to outer space and
various bilateral and multilateral practices and agreements. [The
expanding number of space actor]{.underline}s, objects and debris
multiplies [the hazards associated with the safe and secure space
operations.]{.underline} In short, the norms established by the 1967
Outer Space Treaty (OST) are more relevant than ever. At the same time,
the provisions to ensure compliance with the OST and to implement
various portions of the Treaty have been relatively weak. Accordingly, a
number of top-down and bottom-up proposals and initiatives to reinforce
the current framework for space activities have been introduced. The
top-down proposals include the Russia-China draft treaty proposal on the
"prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space, the threat or
use of force against outer space objects" (known as PPWT), introduced in
the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in 2008, and Canada's 2009 working
paper "on the merits of certain draft transparency and
confidence-building measures and treaty proposals for space
security"\[1\]. [A draft Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities is
another illustration. Bottom-up codes of conduct and best practices
guidelines have also been introduced, including space debris mitigation
guidelines and the concept of space traffic management]{.underline}
(STM). The long-term sustainability initiative of the Scientific and
Technical Subcommittee (STSC) of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses
of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS) is an all-encompassing bottom-up effort.
Various space safety and commercial initiatives have likewise been
established (e.g. the IAASS, SDA). China and Russia have promoted an
arms control approach and have focused on the "Prevention of an Arms
Race in Outer Space" (PAROS), discussed in the CD since 1980s, as well
as a ban on space-based weapons. Their joint working paper entitled,
"Possible Elements for a Future International Legal Agreement on the
Prevention of the Deployment of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or
Use of Force against Outer Space Objects" was introduced in the CD in
June 2002, followed by the PPWT proposal in February 2008. [Although
most countries agree that an arms race in space is not desirable, there
is no consensus that such an arms race is underway, and hence no need
for such arms control measures.]{.underline} Moreover, [there is
currently little momentum behind the PPWT]{.underline} proposal due to
the stalemate at the CD over the past 15 years (as the linkage of
several issues has precluded progress). Nations at the CD have, as yet,
been unable to come to a common view that this treaty would benefit
their national security. Moreover, as the U.S. has long pointed out, [a
ban on weapons in space is inherently unverifiable.]{.underline} A more
practical approach has been the adoption by the UN General Assembly of
the Inter-Agency Debris Mitigation Guidelines in February 2008. It
represents an example of a successful bottom-up approach that has
significantly contributed to preserving the outer space environment. At
the UNCOPUOS Scientific and Technical Subcommittee (STSC), the topics of
space debris, space weather, near-earth objects, nuclear power sources
in space and other topics closely related to space sustainability, have
been on the agenda for many years. A new agenda item of the STSC,
entitled "long-term sustainability of space activities," was originally
initiated by France, and introduced formally in February 2010. It seeks
the adoption of a comprehensive approach to the multifaceted challenges
of preserving space for the generations to come. A Working Group was
established in June 2010, to advance the establishment of practical
measures (reinforced by voluntary guidelines) to enhance space
sustainability. The overarching goal is to formulate "best practices
guidelines" for safer operations in space. The Group has been divided
into four expert units which began their work at the February 2012 STSC
meeting. They include the Sustainable Space Utilization Supporting
Sustainable Development on Earth (group A), Space Situational Awareness
and Debris Mitigation (group B), Space Weather (group C), and Regulatory
Regimes and Guidance for Actors in the Space Arena (group D). A draft
report of the Working Group is to be submitted to the STSC in February
2014. Many familiar with the consensus-based work of the UN argue, quite
justifiably, that t[he evolution of space-related realities is
proceeding faster than the organization's ability to keep
pace.]{.underline} It has been argued that the UNCOPUOS is perhaps being
sidelined by other initiatives such as that of the draft Code of Conduct
or the Space Data Association (SDA). Moreover, UNCOPUOS has yet to
address the more active involvement of private actors, whose role is
increasingly relevant for deliberations on space activities.
Nevertheless, the UNCOPUOS will remain an essential platform with global
reach.\[2\] [A]{.underline} draft [Code of Conduct]{.underline} for
Outer Space Activities, proposed by the EU, [represents a non-binding
document that seeks to promote behavioural norms in space and complement
most other existing initiative]{.underline}s. The proposal, described in
more details below, is an effort on the part of the EU to play a
normative role in space security. Finally, Space Situational Awareness
(SSA) is an important contributor to advancing the responsible use of
space. SSA is one of the most important elements of ensuring the safety
and security of all functioning satellites and spacecraft and enabling
the monitoring and understanding of a constantly changing space
environment. The U.S. seeks to enhance the prevention of on-orbit
collisions via sharing SSA-derived information with commercial operators
and other governments. The commercial Space Data Association (SDA)
facilitates SSA information exchanges between satellite owners and
operators and Europe is seeking to build a Europe-wide SSA system.
High-level policy-makers in Japan are also discussing the upgrading of
their national SSA capabilities, and there are broader discussions
underway on the need to create a more comprehensive SSA picture and
share data and information internationally. Europe's Efforts to Advance
Space Security In Europe, space is now considered a strategic priority
and an increasingly essential component of policy planning and
decision-making. The topic of space security has gained momentum through
such developments as the European Space Policy of May 2007 and the
Lisbon Treaty of 2009, the latter of which gave the European Union (EU)
an explicit mandate to be involved in space matters as a competence to
be exercised parallel to Member States. Accordingly, Europe is now
positioned to pursue and invigorate current space efforts for the
benefit of humankind and Europe's overall global standing. The EU has
been focused on efforts to enhance space security through the building
of European Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capabilities,
participating actively in multilateral venues, including the UNCOPUOS,
and promoting the Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities. The draft
Code of Conduct, introduced by the EU in 2008, 2010, and 2012,
respectively, has been Europe's most significant space security-related
initiative to date. It was stimulated, to a large extent, by the
troubling display of non-transparency and insensitivity to the space
environment shown by China in its 2007 anti-satellite (ASAT) test. A
document entitled "Food For Thought on a Possible Comprehensive Code of
Conduct for Space Objects" was offered by Italy in the CD in March 2007.
The document highlighted a number of gaps in existing TCBMs and
suggested that new TCBMs would be necessary to strengthen adherence to,
and the implementation of, binding and non-binding space
security-related obligations. The EU endorsed this initiative under
Title V of the EU Treaty Concerning the Common Foreign and Security
Policy (CFSP) which was presented to the General Assembly as the
European reaction to UNGA Resolution 61/75 on TCBMs.\[3\] Also in 2007,
Germany organised a workshop entitled "Security and Arms Control in
Space and the Role of the EU" in Berlin as part of its effort to insert
space security on to the EU agenda. In the autumn of 2007, the
Portuguese EU Presidency prepared a first version of a draft Code of
Conduct, later updated by the Slovenian EU Presidency into "Best
Practice Guidelines for/Code of Conduct on Outer Space Activities". By
summer 2008, the first informal consultations were undertaken with key
space-faring nations, including the U.S., China and Russia. The French
EU Presidency that began in July 2008, continued to promote the Code
which resulted in the official release of the first draft Code of
Conduct by the EU Council in December 2008.\[4\] The EU then introduced
the Code to other nations, as well as international bodies. [The EU
engaged in bilateral discussions on the draft document with a number of
countries, including the U.S., China, Russia, Brazil, Canada, India,
Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, South Africa and
Ukraine]{.underline}\[5\], [resulting in a revised version of the Code
introduced in September 2010]{.underline}. During these negotiations,
the EU encountered some reservations concerning the process associated
with its proposal from a number of nations, including the U.S., Russia,
China, India and Brazil. [The U.S. announced on 17 January of this year
its readiness to support negotiations on an "international code of
conduct". Besides the U.S. and Europe, Japan, Australia and several
other countries expressed their support for this
initiative]{.underline}. As a result, the EU officially introduced at
the UNCOPUOS in Vienna a revised draft of the International Code of
Conduct for Outer Space Activities in June 2012. The meeting's purpose
was to prepare countries for the upcoming negotiations on the new draft
proposal that will take place in October 2012. By [introducing the Code
of Conduct, the EU supported the notion that voluntary rules of the
road, grounded in "best practices" among space actors, offers the most
promising approach to achieving space behavioural norms]{.underline}.
The EU emphasized that [the Code of Conduct represents a pragmatic and
incremental process which can assist in achieving enhanced safety and
security in space]{.underline}. The Code has a preventive focus,
emphasizing that activities undertaken in space should involve a high
degree of care, due diligence, and transparency with the aim of building
confidence among space actors. The draft Code is one of the central
proposals for a voluntary international agreement to enhance space
security. [It is]{.underline} also, in part, designed to serve as [an
alternative to treaty proposals for prevention of an arms race in outer
space or bans on space weapons]{.underline} (e.g. PPWT) and is currently
being structured outside of traditional multilateral institutions like
the UN and the CD. The perceived shortcomings of such initiatives, or
global-level governance generally, include the lack of definition
concerning an authority which can effectively enforce the agreed rules
and procedures. Moreover, the general nature of the objectives stated in
the Code leaves considerable room for various, and even conflicting,
interpretations. Accordingly, guidance on more concrete TCBMs could help
substantiate formal initiatives such as the Code. Transparency and
Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs) TCBMs are already present in
existing, legally-binding space agreements. They have been introduced in
various frameworks including UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions
originated at the UNGA First Committee (a key sponsor of which has been
Russia); the related Group of Government Experts (GGE) on "TCBMs in
outer space activities" that will hold its first session in July 2012;
the U.S. 2010 National Space Policy (NSP) and its intention to pursue
"near-term, voluntary, and pragmatic TCBMs"\[6\]; and the TCBMs
introduced through the draft International Code of Conduct for Outer
Space Activities. Existing TCBMs for space carry benefits as well as
some baggage. Both Russia and China, which proposed the CD-related
TCBMs, are proponents of a legally-binding treaty on banning space
weapons that has not, as referenced earlier, gained any traction
internationally. There is also a history of terrestrial TCBM
disappointments, especially in the arms control and missile
proliferation arenas. These mixed results complicate persuading some
space actors of the benefits of TCBMs for non-binding agreements. That
said, [as bottom-up approaches to managing space activities require
supportive mechanisms, TCBMs, in the right circumstances, will likely
serve as an indispensable tool for positive outcomes.]{.underline}\[7\]
Carefully-crafted TCBMs that take into account operational
characteristics of space can go a long way in bolstering space
sustainability. While acknowledging their various limitations, including
the issue of verification and compliance, realistic [TCBMs will almost
certainly play an essential role in diplomatic venues. Accordingly,
states possessing an advanced understanding and commitment to
international law are going to be essential for more creative and
persuasive space diplomacy.]{.underline} Conclusion [There now exists
widespread recognition of the global dependency on space systems. This
recognition is accompanied by the desire of a growing number of space
actors to achieve maximum autonomy in a number of areas. Nonetheless, a
more "crowded" space environment brings the elevated risk of accidents
and incidents. The irresponsible acts of one actor can have damaging
consequences for all, supporting a joint interest in the safety,
security and sustainability of outer space activities.]{.underline} As
indicated above, [different multilateral efforts to address space
security, both top-down and bottom-up, are underway. Space-related
cooperation helps reaffirm the principle of the peaceful uses of outer
space. To cooperate meaningfully,]{.underline} however[, countries need
to share a common appreciation of the value that a collective approach
to space security brings versus a go-it-alone policy.]{.underline} To
achieve such a consensus is challenging, as [more countries have come to
understand the importance of space-derived technologies and solutions
for their military capabilities.]{.underline} Moreover, new dual-use
technologies complicate the effort to establish balanced measures that
enhance stability and predictability in space. Although [virtually all
space-faring nations desire to mitigate the risks associated with
orbital debris, secure free access to space and avoid misunderstandings
and incidents, the means of implementing certain of these objectives
remain elusiv]{.underline}e. Given the complex space environment
involving new actors and technologies[, there is an urgent need for
creative TCBMs, especially when no new viable space treaty is presently
on the horizon]{.underline}. Such TCBMs can help bridge the gap between
national space policies and more cooperative international
understandings and agreements. Even if a meaningful international
accord, such as an International Code of Conduct, is ultimately
concluded, the need for TCBMs will continue unabated as new technologies
and challenges to space operations emerge. Accordingly, [there is no
side-stepping the quest for more robust and global space security
measures and the increasingly urgent need to hold both state and
non-state actors accountable for their behaviour in space.]{.underline}

#### The NSP's cooperative approach and international consultation represents a new method of pursuing space interests

International Affairs at George Washington University

(February, 2011, John M., Space Policy,"Change and Continuity in US
Space Policy" Vol. 27, Issue 1, p. 22-23, Science Direct, FS)

[The new National Space Policy directs US government agencies to look
for increased opportunities for international cooperation in a wide
variety of areas, ranging from space science to space
surveillance]{.underline} and maritime domain awareness.
[This]{.underline} approach [reflects the broader foreign policy
strateg]{.underline}y of the Obama administration. For example,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a July 2010 speech: Our
approach to foreign policy must reflect the world as it is, not as it
used to be. It does not make sense to adapt a 19th-century concert of
powers or a 20th-century balance-of-power strategy. [We cannot go back
to Cold War containment or to unilateralism.. We will lead by inducing
greater cooperation among a greater number of actors and reducing
competition, tilting the balance away from a multi-polar world and
toward a multipartner world]{.underline}.4 [This approach stands in
rather stark contrast to the unilateralist path to leadership
articulated in the 2006 Bush administration]{.underline} space policy.
[It also recognizes that in the space arena other nations and groups of
nations have developed]{.underline}, and are continuing to develop,
[world-class space capabilities, and that unless they are engaged with
the USA as they pursue their own objectives, other poles of space
leadership will emerge.]{.underline} [Included in areas for increased
cooperation are several national security and dual use space activities,
in particular space situational awareness]{.underline}. In pursuit of
the policy's objectives, [representatives of the Department of State
and]{.underline} Department of [Defense have]{.underline} in recent
months [carried out a series of consultations in various venues around
the world regarding ways of working together in such areas]{.underline};
[this]{.underline} represents a significant departure from past US
practice, and [could represent a significant change in how the USA
advances its own interests in the security space arena.]{.underline}

### 2NC---No Space Militarization (Equipment)

#### Military equipment in space is cumbersome and worthless

American, February,
http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you)

Basing [weapons in orbit]{.underline} also pre­sents difficult technical
obstacles. They [would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all
kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic
signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against
such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is
bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch
costs.]{.underline} [Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous
mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The
paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would
make hiding large weapons problematic]{.underline}. And [because
satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a
time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many
weapons]{.underline}.

#### No risk of space weapons

\"The wars of the future will not be fought on the battlefield or at
sea,\" a military academy commandant voiced by Willem Dafoe intones
toward the end of a now-classic 1997 episode of The Simpsons. \"They
will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall mountain.\"
This was meant as a joke, but the latter half of that statement would
soon prove eerily prescient when India and Pakistan battled over
Kashmir\'s Siachen glacier \-- a strategically irrelevant ice field
sitting over 18,000 feet above sea level \-- during the Kargil War in
1999. [For now, the prospect of military conflict in outer space still
resides in the realm of dystopia or absurdity]{.underline}, to the point
that a White House petition demanding the construction of a Star
Wars-style \"Death Star\" could be treated as a harmless prank. In
rejecting the petition this week, the White House rightly wondered why a
debt-strapped U.S. government would spend \$850 quadrillion on a weapons
system \"with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man
starship.\" Thankfully, the prospect of an orbital space-to-earth
battlestation doesn\'t even need to be treated seriously. But it wasn\'t
always this way. In 1952, the eminent rocket scientist Werner Von Braun
imagined that a future space station would function as an orbital
nuclear platform. Space historians believe that Russia\'s Salyut 3 space
station, which was launched in June of 1974, had a cannon on board, in
case a craft or satellite from an enemy country attempted to disrupt its
mission. The Soviet Union experimented with Fractional Orbital
Bombardment Systems in the 1960s and 70s \-- basically nuclear delivery
systems that were capable of orbiting the earth. [The U.S. even
detonated a nuclear weapon over 200 miles above the Pacific
Ocean]{.underline} in July of 1962, an incident [known as Starfish
Prime]{.underline} that, according to Harvard University astrophysicist
Jonathan McDowell, halved the useful lifetime of all satellites then in
orbit, knocked out power in Hawaii, created an artificial Van Allen Belt
that persisted for five years, and released radiation into the
atmosphere that wouldn\'t fully dissipate until the end of the decade.
For a time, it was all but taken for granted that space would not only
be militarized, but weaponized \-- used as a venue or staging area for
violent clashes between space-faring nations, or attacks on the surface
of the earth. Space war wasn\'t a punch line, but a possibility that
nuclear-armed powers didn\'t think they could afford to ignore. [The
results of the Starfish event hint at one reason why that changed.
\"This is a great weapon. It does a lot of damage \-- but it also killed
everything you had yourself]{.underline},\" McDowell says of the results
of the high-altitude nuclear test. [War in space was sure to have a
cataclysmic effect on the country with the most space assets, regardless
of the end result]{.underline}. But what about war from space? For
powerful space-faring countries, space-to-earth or earth-to-space combat
is about as practical as it is desirable \-- which is to say, not very.
\"[Space is incredibly useful]{.underline} for the military for a lot of
things,\" McDowell explains. \"It\'s great [for intelligence,
communication and navigation. The natural thing is to ask, \'where are
my X-Wing fighters?\' The fact is that it\'s hard to find a rationale
for them]{.underline}.\" Laura Grego, a senior scientist in the global
security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, explained why [an
orbital weapons platform]{.underline} \-- the kind of big-ticket
military asset that you might want a fleet of X-Wing-type vehicles to
protect \-- [is impractical for attacking targets on earth. \"Everything
in space is moving at rapid speeds. At the same time, the earth is
rotating underneath it]{.underline}\....as it\'s going around, [you
can\'t hold]{.underline} \[[the weapon]{.underline}\] [above your
target. You might be over one country for 15 minutes and then you\'re
gone]{.underline}.\" This tiny orbital window is called the absentee
ratio, and an ICBM, which can hit any target on earth within minutes,
isn\'t constrained by one. McDowell added that in order [to reach
atmospheric velocity, a rocket needs to reach a breakneck seven
kilometers-per-second]{.underline}, far [faster than the four to five
kilometers-per-second an ICBM must travel. From a purely strategic
standpoint, orbiting a weapon for space-to-ground use is more expensive
and far less useful than existing, more earth-bound
capabilities]{.underline}. Simply orbiting a nuke, while possible, is
good for little other than blackmail, or, at best, a Dr. Strangelove or
Dead Hand-style insurance policy for a paranoid and heavily-armed
space-faring state. The space nuke would be a means of ensuring that
someone (or some thing) has the capability of effectively wiping out
most or perhaps all of the 1,016 satellites that currently orbit the
earth, while rendering their orbits so debris-strewn as to be totally
and perhaps permanently useless. [Such dangerous and cavalier behavior
is the stuff of cinematic super-villainy \-- not
statecraft]{.underline}. But there\'s another, more idealistic reason
humanity is safe from the scourge of space war. And ironically, it
suggests that we might not be safe forever. [The ban on Death Star-like
orbital weaponry is one of the more robust norms in international law. A
prohibition on stationing weapons of mass destruction in space, as well
as the total demilitarization of the Moon, is enshrined in article 4 of
the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which 126 countries have
signed]{.underline}. As University of Nebraska law professor and space
law expert Frans von der Dunk notes, the treaty bans the stationing of
weapons of mass destruction in space without banning their actual use in
space. The stationing and use of kinetic or conventional weaponry is
also allowed. Yet the most worrying aspect of the current legal regime
is that the laws of war extend to the heavens as well. \"The general
international law on the law of force and the prohibition on the use of
military force also applies in outer space,\" says von der Dunk. \"If,
as part of your self-defense you need your satellite to shoot down the
satellite of your aggressor\...that is perfectly allowed.\" Even so,
[the 1967 treaty demonstrates that in space, the peaceniks seem to be
winning]{.underline}, at least for now. Joan Johnson-Freese of the Naval
War College explained that there are two ways that, at the most
schematic level, there are two ways the international legal regime could
conceive of outer space: \"On one end you put the view that space is a
common heritage of mankind,\" she says. \"The other end of the spectrum
is that air, land and sea are all environments, and all those
environments have been weaponized and therefore it\'s inevitable that
space too will also become weaponized.\" The latter formulation raises a
number of chilling possibilities: most people probably don\'t expect a
war to break out in space, but the soldiers at Siachen probably didn\'t
expect to be fighting atop an 18,000 mountain pass either. Humanity has
proven willing to fight over literally anything, so long as the
capability exists. Why should we assume space will be different? [Space
hasn\'t been weaponized, and the general anti-weaponization tilt of the
1967 treaty is part of the reason why. That tilt has gained the status
of a respected legal norm, one arguably strengthened by the fact that
the treaty itself was founded on a bedrock of mutual
self-interest]{.underline}. \"In the 1960s, [the superpowers were able
to agree]{.underline} that [there was more of a benefit in keeping the
other party from doing it than they saw a drawback in themselves being
forced to abstain from it]{.underline},\" von der Dunk says of the U.S.
and Soviet Union\'s view towards stationing weapons of mass destruction
in space. In other words, each side believed that preventing their
opponent from weaponizing space was worth the potential strategic cost
of foreclosing on their own ability to weaponize space. [Even after the
Cold War, the norm has endured]{.underline}.

### 2NC---Warming Inevitable

#### Already passed the tipping point

Michael **McCarthy**, Environment Editor of The Independent, Global
warming: passing the \'tipping point\', **2006**
http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/global-warming-passing-the-tipping-point-466187.html

[A crucial global warming \"tipping point\"]{.underline} for the Earth,
highlighted only last week by the British Government, **[has already
been passed, with devastating consequences.]{.underline}** Research
commissioned by The Independent reveals that [the accumulation of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has now crossed a threshold, set down
by scientists from around the world at a conference in
Britain]{.underline} last year, [beyond which really dangerous climate
change is]{.underline} likely to be **[unstoppable.]{.underline}** The
implication is that [some of global warming\'s worst predicted effects,
from destruction of ecosystems to increased hunger and water
shortages]{.underline} for billions of people, **[cannot now be avoided,
whatever we do.]{.underline}** It gives considerable force to the
contention by the green guru Professor James Lovelock, put forward last
month in The Independent, that [**climate change is now past the point
of no return.** The danger point we are now firmly on course for is a
rise in global mean temperatures to 2 degrees]{.underline} above the
level before the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. At the
moment, global mean temperatures have risen to about 0.6 degrees above
the pre-industrial era - and worrying signs of climate change, such as
the rapid melting of the Arctic ice in summer, are already increasingly
evident. But a rise to 2 degrees would be far more serious. By that
point it is likely that [the Greenland ice sheet will already have begun
irreversible melting, threatening the world with a sea-level rise of
several metres. Agricultural yields will have started to
fall]{.underline}, not only in Africa but also in Europe, the US and
Russia, putting up to 200 million more people at risk from hunger, and
up to 2.8 billion additional people at risk of water shortages for both
drinking and irrigation. [The Government\'s conference]{.underline} on
Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, held at the UK Met Office in Exeter a
year ago, [highlighted a clear threshold in the
accumulation]{.underline} of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide
(CO2) in the atmosphere, [which should not be surpassed if the 2 degree
point was to be avoided with \"relatively high certainty\". This was for
the concentration of CO2]{.underline} and other gases such as methane
and nitrous oxide, taken together in their global warming effect, [to
stay below 400ppm]{.underline} (parts per million) in CO2 terms - or in
the jargon, the \"equivalent concentration\" of CO2 should remain below
that level. The warning was highlighted in the official report of the
Exeter conference, published last week. However, an investigation by The
Independent has established that [the CO2 equivalent
concentration]{.underline}, largely unnoticed by the scientific and
political communities, **[has now risen beyond this
threshold.]{.underline}** This number is not a familiar one even among
climate researchers, and is not readily available. For example, when we
put the question to a very senior climate scientist, he said: \"I would
think it\'s definitely over 400 - probably about 420.\" So we asked one
of the world\'s leading experts on the effects of greenhouse gases on
climate, Professor Keith Shine, head of the meteorology department at
the University of Reading, to calculate it precisely. Using the latest
available figures (for 2004), his calculations show the equivalent
concentration of C02, taking in the effects of methane and nitrous oxide
at 2004 levels, is now 425ppm. This is made up of CO2 itself, at 379ppm;
the global warming effect of the methane in the atmosphere, equivalent
to another 40ppm of CO2; and the effect of nitrous oxide, equivalent to
another 6ppm of CO2. [The tipping point]{.underline} warned about last
week by the Government **[is already behind us.]{.underline}**

### 1NC---No Warming Extinction

#### Extinction claims inaccurately deviate from predictive modelling---adaptation checks worst case scenarios

[Given that this temperature increase was greater in magnitude and rate
to **anything predicted for the next century**, it is an extremely
useful time interval to examine possible biotic responses to 4 ◦ C and
beyond]{.underline}. In order to assess biotic responses, however, it is
also important to have records with a good temporal resolution, ideally
annual resolution. [A review of the vegetational responses recorded in
11 sedimentary sequences with a suitably high temporal resolution from
around the North Atlantic region]{.underline} (Williams et al., 2002),
[indicates that in North America and Europe, in less than 100 years,
vegetation responded to the rapid climate change 11 600 years
ago.]{.underline} [For]{.underline} [tree populations, this change often
occurred in less than two or three generations.]{.underline} The nature
of the response depended upon the former vegetation; in central Europe
(e.g. Willis et al., 1997; Feurdean et al., 2007) and parts of eastern
North America, for example, there is evidence in many regions for a
change from needle-leaved dominated to broad-leaved dominated forest,
often in less than 100 years. In comparison, closer to the ice-sheets,
in western Norway, there was a rapid expansion in the herbaceous and
shrub ﬂora and a later arrival of trees, probably due to a time lag for
migration from refugial areas (Birks & Birks, 2008). The increase in
tree populations, however, even in these northerly regions was still
rapid (Birks & Ammann, 2000). A recent study from the East Baltic
region, for example, indicates that those trees that survived in
northerly refugial populations (Betula, Pinus, Picea) established within
a century, suggesting climatedriven ecosystem changes rather than
gradual plant succession on new deglaciated land (Heikkila¨ et al.,
2009). Thus [some species expanded very fast in response to late-glacial
warming]{.underline}. There is also evidence, however, for species that
expanded slowly or largely failed to expand from their refugia in
response to this interval of rapid climate warming (Svenning & Skov,
2007) suggesting that persistence and expansion is also dependent on
being in a location that was continuously suitable during the
glacial--interglacial 'cycle' (Bennett et al., 1991). Biotic responses
to this interval of rapid climate warming throughout Europe and North
America therefore include evidence for (i) rapid expansion of in situ
populations, (ii) large-scale species range shifts (Birks & Willis,
2008), (iii) community turnover (Birks & Birks, 2008) and (iv) the
formation of novel community assemblages (Williams & Jackson, 2007).
However, **[at no site yet studied, anywhere in the world, is there
evidence in the fossil record for largescale climate-driven extinction
during this interval of rapid climate change]{.underline}** (Botkin et
al., 2007). [In some regions there was local or regional extinction, as
is apparent throughout the cold-stages of the Quaternary when increasing
numbers of tropical species went locally or regionally extinct in
Europe]{.underline} (Tallis, 1991; Svenning, 2003; Willis & Niklas,
2004). There is evidence in the fossil record for the total extinction
of only one species, the east North American spruce Picea critchﬁeldii
(Jackson & Weng, 1999), but [evidence for widespread global extinction
of plants in this interval of very rapid climate warming has yet to be
demonstrated. It had been argued previously that the large-scale
megafaunal extinction that occurred at the end of the Pleistocene was
climatically driven, but a large number of studies now suggests that
this was a predominantly human-driven extinction event that spanned
thousands of years]{.underline} (Koch & Barnosky, 2006; Johnson, 2009)
[rather than a rapid response to the large temperature increase at the
late-glacial/post-glacial transition.]{.underline}

### 2NC---No Warming Extinction

#### History disproves

**Willis, et. al, '10** \[Kathy J. Willis, Keith D. Bennett, Shonil A.
Bhagwat & H. John B. Birks (2010): 4 °C and beyond: what did this mean
for biodiversity in the past?, Systematics and Biodiversity, 8:1, 3-9,
<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14772000903495833>, \]

So [why is there this discrepancy between what the fossil and historical
records]{.underline} are [tell]{.underline}ing [us about extinctions
driven by climate change and those predicted through
models]{.underline}? [Many biota,]{.underline} using evidence from
fossil plant records, [likely have much wider ecological tolerances than
are usually assigned in models]{.underline}. Also, [the present-day
distribution of species, especially in mid to high latitudes, often has
a strong historical/pre-historical cultural imprint]{.underline} (e.g.
Bradshaw & Lindbladh, 2005) [which again is often not taken into account
in the models]{.underline}. However, [the discrepancy is also in part
due to the coarse scale of the models used to estimate climate
change-induced habitat loss]{.underline}. For example, [a recent study
to assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the
European scale]{.underline} (16 km × 16 km grid cells) [are also
predicted from local-scale data and modelling]{.underline} (25 m × 25 m
grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps [indicated that whereas the
European-scale model predict loss of all suitable habitats, local-scale
models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100% of
species]{.underline} (Randin et al., 2009). [A similar conclusion was
also reached in a study to assess the predictive accuracy of bioclimatic
envelope models for the future distribution of European
butterﬂies]{.underline} (Luoto & Heikkinen, 2008). Here, [of the 100
species studied, a model that included topography predicted only half of
the species losses for the period 2051--2080 compared with those
predicted by a climate-only model]{.underline}. In contrast, the number
of species predicted to disappear from ﬂatlands doubled. [It would
appear from both these studies that habitat heterogeneity resulting from
topographic diversity may be an essential factor for persistence of
biota in a future changing climate]{.underline} (Willis & Bhagwat,
2009). Based on these studies, and many others using fossil and
historical records, we argue that [evidence for the widely cited view
that future climate change poses an equal or greater threat to global
biodiversity than anthropogenic land-use change and habitat
loss]{.underline} (Thomas et al., 2004) [is]{.underline}
[equivocal:]{.underline} extinctions driven by the latter processes of
habitat loss pose a far greater threat to global biodiversity. It is
also questionable, however, whether it is even possible to now separate
the two processes, given that over 80% of the Earth's terrestrial biomes
now have evidence of an anthropogenic impact upon them (Ellis &
Ramankutty, 2008). What we probably need to be considering is the
synergistic effect of these two factors on biodiversity (Travis, 2003)

**[China]{.underline}**'s military [stepped up **pressure**]{.underline}
[on the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
on Monday by [calling for a]{.underline} **[government sell-off of U.S.
debt securities]{.underline}** [in **retaliation** for]{.underline}
recent **[arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}**. A group of senior Chinese
military officers also said in state-controlled media interviews that
Beijing's leaders should boost defense spending and expand force
deployments in the wake of the Pentagon's announcement last month of a
new \$6.4 million arms package for the island state claimed by Beijing.
**[Senior officers]{.underline}** from the Chinese National Defense
University and Academy of Military Sciences [made]{.underline} what some
view as [an **economic warfare threat**]{.underline}, something outlined
in past military writings. The comments by Maj. Gen. Zhu Chenghu and
Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan and Senior Col. Ke Chunqiao appeared in the state-run
Outlook Weekly magazine, part of the Xinhua News Agency, published in
Beijing on Monday. Gen. Luo warned that China could attack the U.S. "by
oblique means and stealthy feints," and he called for **[retaliation for
the arms sale]{.underline}**. "For example, [we could sanction them
using economic means, such as]{.underline} **[dumping some U.S.
government bonds,"]{.underline}** Gen. Luo said. "Our retaliation should
not be restricted to merely military matters, and we should adopt a
strategic package of counterpunches covering politics, military affairs,
diplomacy and economics to treat both the symptoms and root cause of
this disease," said Gen. Luo, a researcher at the Academy of Military
Sciences. [**China** holds]{.underline} nearly **[\$800
billion]{.underline}** [worth of Treasury debt securities]{.underline}.
[[It is **not clear**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[what impact selling
off]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [[securities would have on
the]{.underline}]{.mark} struggling **[[U.S.
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, analysts say that selling off
some bonds could drive up interest rates and disrupt U.S. economic
recovery efforts. At the State Department, spokesman P.J.
**[[Crowley]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[dismissed the economic threat
as]{.mark} potentially]{.underline}
**[[self-defeating]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "**[That would be biting the
nose to spite the face]{.underline}**," Mr. Crowley said. "[[The
economies of the United States and China are
**intertwined**]{.underline}]{.mark}." The Chinese military comments,
however, reflect the contents of a 1999 book by two Chinese colonels
called "Unrestricted Warfare," which called on the Chinese military to
adopt unconventional methods and strategy in waging war, specifically
both "financial" and "trade" war along with other forms of warfare. The
second officer, Gen. Zhu, said Monday that proposed U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan threatens Chinese military bases along the southern coast across
the 100-mile Taiwan Strait. "This gives us no choice but to increase
defense spending and adjust \[military\] deployments," said Gen. Zhu,
who is with the National Defense University in Beijing. Gen. Zhu made
headlines in 2005 when he told reporters that China would use nuclear
weapons to attack U.S. cities if the United States struck China with
precision-guided conventional missiles. The statement raised questions
at the time among Pentagon officials over whether China had abandoned
its stated policy of not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a
conflict. After the remarks, China's government sought to play down the
incident by quietly putting out word to Western journalists that Gen.
Zhu had been demoted, a claim accepted by many U.S. China hands but one
that was called into question by his comments in the magazine this week.
The military leaders' comments are unusual because tightly controlled
state-run media in China normally do not permit such provocative
comments directly criticizing the United States to be published. China's
military has no apparent control over the country's financial policies,
although the military remains a powerful force in the communist system
where ultimate power resides in the Central Military Commission, headed
by Chinese President Hu Jintao along with two key generals as deputies.
Pentagon officials have expressed concerns in recent years that China's
military may be acting outside its political leadership. They pointed to
differing explanations by Chinese military and civilian leaders
regarding the secret January 2007 anti-satellite missile test, and a
perplexing incident in 2007 when the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk had
permission to dock in Hong Kong for Thanksgiving but was turned away by
Chinese authorities upon nearing the port. The last time Chinese
officials raised economic threats against the United States was 2007
when two economic officials warned of what some called the "nuclear
option" --- a campaign of economic threats --- meant as a political
weapon to counter opposition in Congress to China's currency
manipulation that has undermined the U.S. dollar. The Chinese military
officers said China's next defense budget, expected to be made public in
February, should reflect Beijing's opposition to the Taiwan arms sale.
"Clearly propose that due to the threat in the Taiwan Sea, we are
increasing military spending," Gen. Luo said. Gen. Luo said China must
change its approach to the United States and assert its power. "China's
attitude and actions over U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan will be
increasingly tough," he said. "That is inevitable with rising national
strength." John Tkacik, a former State Department China specialist, said
[China's Central Military Commission has the **power** to order
financial measures]{.underline} [such as **selling U.S.
securities**]{.underline}, although it is a complex process. "[The
Chinese military]{.underline} now [believes]{.underline} that [China has
**tremendous economic and financial leverage**]{.underline}, especially
[over the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [and they are giving]{.underline} **[fair
warning]{.underline}** [to the world that **they will use it** when they
can]{.underline}," he said. The Obama administration, like its
predecessors, has said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are authorized under
the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in the aftermath of
the shift in diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to mainland China. The
act authorizes sales of defensive arms. China's government has rejected
the U.S. justification, claiming that U.S.-China joint communiques
outlining relations call for limiting and eventually ending all arms
sales to Taiwan. China and the United States have clashed in recent
weeks on a number of issues in addition to the Taiwan arms sale,
including Beijing's opposition to the upcoming meeting between President
Obama and the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also criticized China recently for
tightening controls on the Internet, which she suggested was a violation
of basic freedom. The administration also has sought the Chinese
government's explanation for the recent computer attack on the Internet
giant Google and several other U.S. high-technology firms, suggesting
that Beijing was behind the computer intrusions and data theft. China's
military spending has increased sharply over the past decade as part of
China's semi-secret military buildup that has involved new deployments
of advanced ballistic and cruise missiles, large numbers of new warships
and submarines, new advanced fighter bombers and various high-tech
weapons ranging from computer network attacks and anti-satellite
weapons.

### 2NC -- No Debt Selloff 

#### No Treasury bill sell-off 

**Christensen 15 --** William P. Boswell Professor of World Politics of
Peace and War and Director of the China and the World Program at
Princeton (Thomas, [The China Challenge: Shaping the Choices of a Rising
Power]{.underline}, p. 62-63)

This contradiction relates to China\'s much-vaunted surplus in foreign
currency reserves---[Beijing has become the largest foreign holder of
U.S. Treasury bills in the world]{.underline}. Whatever leverage this
relationship might provide China, and it is almost certainly quite
limited because [China would never have an economic incentive to sell
off the bills precipitously]{.underline}, the stockpile of Treasury
bills is also arguably as much a sign of economic weakness for China as
it is economic strength. [China\'s continued disproportionate dependence
on exports as a job creator, its fear of domestic inflation, and its
subsequent need to \"sterilize\" its current account surplus with the
world compels China to purchase bonds in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and elsewhere. In this instance, \"sterilization\"
simply means shipping overseas the foreign reserves accumulated through
exporting more than is imported. The only other ways the state could
manage that problem would be to allow inflation or to allow its own
currency to revalue. Inflation could harm the economy and cause social
instability among the many urban citizens and government workers on
fixed incomes. Revaluation could cost China manufacturing jobs because
it would hurt the competitiveness of exports and increase the
competitiveness of imports. But China need not buy U.S. Treasury bills
with this excess capital. It could purchase physical assets with the
money, invest in stock markets in other countries, or shift from U.S.
dollars to a wider basket of currencies. All of this has happened to
some degree, but there is little sign that China has significantly
slowed down its purchases of U.S. Treasury bills. The main reason, to
return to my earlier point, is that despite the financial crisis, and to
some degree because of it, the attractiveness of the U.S. bills as a
relatively secure and highly liquid safe haven (in comparison to other
investments) has only increased. To understand this, one has only to
look at interest rates. Compared to, say, Spain, the United States has
to pay a very low amount to borrow money because it is seen as a
low-risk borrower. The danger that China might sell off bonds
precipitously to coerce the United States appeals to many commentators,
including Chinese ones. In 2010 nationalist commentators prescribed such
a strategy following the announcement of a new tranche of U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan. But the government was wise not to take such advice.
Indeed, the scenario makes little sense. For example, Subramanian posits
that [China in the future might hold \$4 trillion in U.S.
debt]{.underline}. If we grant him that, then [we would]{.underline}
also [have to assume that China will have remained overly dependent on
exports for continued growth and will not have broken its addiction to
sterilization as a means of keeping exchange rates and inflation
low]{.underline}. But even if this proves to be the case, [why would
China want to sell off a large initial portion of its bonds for the
intended purpose of hurting the U.S. economy, one of its largest markets
for exports?]{.underline} [China would likely lose a huge amount of
money in the first round, when its remaining bonds dropped precipitously
in value]{.underline}. But more important, [by damaging the U.S. economy
and basically threatening economic warfare, China would almost certainly
have done severe damage to a major export market and a source of foreign
direct investmen]{.underline}t. Reducing the overall purchasing power of
the United States and upsetting it politically would also risk
reciprocal economic punishment.

alone. [These results throw light on behavior not only during the
crisis, but throughout the WTO period]{.underline}, from 1995 to the
present. One concern may be that the restraint we observe during
widespread crises is actually the result of a decrease in aggregate
demand and that domestic pressure for import relief is lessened by the
decline of world trade. [By **controlling** for **product-level
imports**, we show that the restraint on remedy use is not a byproduct
of declining imports]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}
**[also]{.underline}** [take into account the ability of]{.underline}
some [countries to **manipulate their currency** and demonstrate that
the relationship between crisis and trade protection **holds**
independent of exchange rate policies]{.underline}. Government
[[decisions to impose costs on]{.mark} their [trade partners]{.mark} by
taking advantage of their legal right to use flexibility
measures]{.underline} are driven not only by the domestic situation but
also by circumstances abroad. This [[can give rise to an individual
**incentive for strategic self-restraint** toward]{.mark} trade
[partners in similar economic trouble]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under
conditions of widespread crisis, [[government leaders **fear** the
**repercussions** that their own]{.mark} use of trade [protection may
have on]{.mark} the behavior of trade [partners]{.mark} at a time [when
they cannot afford]{.mark} the economic cost of [a trade
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Institutions]{.mark} [provide]{.mark}
**monitoring** and [a venue for]{.mark} **leader interaction** that
**facilitates [coordination]{.mark}** among states]{.underline}. Here
the key function is [to reinforce expectations that any move to protect
industries will trigger similar moves in other countries]{.underline}.
Such coordination often draws on shared historical analogies, such as
the Smoot--Hawley lesson, which form a focal point to shape beliefs
about appropriate state behavior. Much of the literature has focused on
the more visible action of legal enforcement through dispute settlement,
but this only captures part of the story. Our research suggests that
[tools of informal governance such as leader pledges, guidance from the
Director General, trade policy reviews, and plenary meetings **play a
real role** within the trade regime]{.underline}. In the absence of
sufficiently stringent rules over flexibility measures, compliance alone
is insufficient during a global economic crisis. [These
**circumstances** trigger **[informal mechanisms]{.mark}** that
[complement]{.mark} [legal rules]{.mark} to **support
cooperation**]{.underline}. [During widespread crisis, legal enforcement
would be inadequate, and informal governance helps to bolster the
system]{.underline}. Informal coordination is by nature difficult to
observe, and we are unable to directly measure this process. Instead, we
examine the variation in responses across crises of varying severity,
within the context of the same formal setting of the WTO. Yet by
focusing on discretionary tools of protection---trade remedies and
tariff hikes within the bound rate---we can offer conclusions about how
systemic crises shape country restraint independent of formal
institutional constraints. Insofar as [institutions are
generating]{.underline} such [restraint]{.underline}, we offer that it
is [by facilitating informal coordination]{.underline}, since all these
instruments of trade protection fall within the letter of the law.
Future research should explore trade policy at the micro level to
identify which pathway is the most important for coordination. Research
at a more macro-historical scope could compare how countries respond to
crises under fundamentally different institutional contexts. In sum, the
determinants of protection include economic downturns not only at home
but also abroad. [Rather than reinforcing pressure for protection,
pervasive [crisis]{.mark} in the global economy is shown to
[generate]{.mark} countervailing [pressure for restraint]{.mark} in
response to domestic crisis]{.underline}. In some cases, **[hard times
[bring more, not less]{.mark}, international
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The final significant outcome addresses [a dog]{.underline} that
[hasn\'t barked]{.underline}: the effect of the Great Recession on
cross-border conflict and violence. [During the initial stages of the
crisis, multiple [analysts asserted]{.mark} that the financial [crisis
would lead]{.mark} states [to]{.mark} increase their use of
[force]{.mark}]{.underline} as a tool for staying in power.42 They
voiced genuine concern that the global economic downturn would lead to
an increase in conflict---[whether through]{.underline} greater internal
[repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up of great
power conflict]{.underline}. Violence in the Middle East, border
disputes in the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy
movement fueled impressions of a surge in global public disorder.
[**[The]{.mark} aggregate [data suggest otherwise]{.mark}**,
however]{.underline}. The Institute for Economics and Peace has
concluded that \"[the average level of [peacefulness in]{.mark} 20[12
is]{.mark} approximately [the same as]{.mark} it was in
20[07]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"43 [Interstate
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline} in particular [has [declined]{.mark}
since the start of the financial [crisis]{.mark}, as have **military
expenditures**]{.underline} in most sampled countries. Other [studies
confirm that]{.underline} [the Great Recession [has not
triggered]{.mark} any increase in violent
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as Lotta Themner and Peter
Wallensteen conclude: \"\[T\]he pattern is one of relative stability
when we consider the trend for the past five years.\"44
[The]{.underline} secular [decline in violence that started with the end
of the Cold War has not been reversed]{.underline}. Rogers Brubaker
observes that \"[the crisis has not]{.underline} to date [generated the
surge in protectionist [**nationalism** or]{.mark} ethnic
[exclusion]{.mark} that might have been expected]{.underline}.\"43

Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be
dissolved if severe conflicts of interest were to arise. Could the more
peaceful world generate new interests that would bring the members of
the community into sharp disputes? 45 A zero-sum sense of status would
be one example, perhaps linked to a steep rise in nationalism. More
likely would be [a [worsening]{.mark} of]{.underline} the [current
[economic difficulties]{.mark},]{.underline} which
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [[produce]{.mark} greater
[nationalism]{.mark}, undermine democracy and bring back old-fashioned
beggar-my-neighbor economic policies]{.underline}. [[While]{.mark} these
[dangers are real]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[it is hard to

enough]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to lead]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[members of [the community to]{.mark} contemplate [fighting each
other]{.mark}. It is not so much that economic
interdependence]{.underline} has proceeded to the point where it [could
not be reversed]{.underline} -- states that were more internally
interdependent than anything seen internationally have fought bloody
civil wars. [Rather it is that]{.underline} **[[even if the more extreme
versions of]{.mark} free [trade and]{.mark} economic [liberalism become
discredited]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [it is]{.underline} [hard to see
how]{.underline}]{.mark} without building on a preexisting high level of
political conflict [[leaders and mass opinion]{.mark} would come to
[believe]{.mark} that [their countries could prosper by]{.mark}
impoverishing or]{.underline} even [[attacking
others]{.underline}]{.mark}. Is it possible that problems will not only
become severe, but that people will entertain the thought that they have
to be solved by war? [While a pessimist could note that this argument
does not appear as outlandish as it did before the financial
crisis]{.underline}, [an optimist could reply (correctly]{.underline},
in my view) [that the very fact that we have seen]{.underline} **[such a
[sharp economic down-turn]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[without]{.underline}
**[anyone]{.underline}** [suggesting]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[force]{.mark}]{.underline} of arms [is the solution]{.underline}

#### No Trump diversions from lashout

Håkan **Frisén 17**, Head of Economic Forecasting at SEB, 2-22-17,
\"Global economy resilient to new political challenges,\"
https://sebgroup.com/press/news/global-economy-resilient-to-new-political-challenges

The interplay between economics and politics was undoubtedly a dominant
feature of analyses during 2016. As we know, [it was difficult to
foresee both election results and their economic consequences. It
was]{.underline} certainly [not strange that economists were unable
to]{.underline} predict the Brexit referendum outcome or [Donald Trump's
victory, when public opinion polling organisations and betting firms
failed to do so,]{.underline} but lessons might be learned from the
economic assessment impacts they made. [[Economists]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably tend to [**[exaggerate]{.mark}** the importance of more general
[political]{.mark} phenomena. While in the midst of elections that
appear historically important, it is tempting to present **alarmist
[projections]{.mark}**]{.underline} about election outcomes that seem
improbable and/or unpleasant. [But once the initial shock effect has
faded, more ordinary economic data such as corporate reports and
macroeconomic figures take the upper hand. Psychological effects often
exaggerated One important observation is that **[it is difficult to find
any]{.mark} historical [correlation between]{.mark} heightened security
policy [tensions and econ]{.mark}omic activity**. Households and
businesses do not seem]{.underline} to be especially [sensitive in their
consumption or capital spending behaviour.]{.underline} This is perhaps
because [uncertainty is offset by investments in a defence
build-up]{.underline}, for example. [Only when the conditions that
directly determine profitability and investments are
affected,]{.underline} for example via rising oil prices or poorly
functioning financial markets, [will the effects become clear.
Markets]{.underline} also seem to have a general tendency to [assume
that the economic policy makers can actually **behave rationally in
crisis situations**, until this has been disproved. Both during the US
sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007-2008 and the euro zone\'s existential
crisis a few years later, for a rather long time the market maintained
its faith that a response would come.]{.underline} Not until after a
lengthy period of inept actions by decision makers did these crises
become genuinely acute, with large secondary effects as a consequence.
[This market \"patience\" is presumably based on a long-time pattern of
recurring bailout measures by governments and central
banks,]{.underline} which usually benefit risk-taking at the expense of
caution or speculation that policy responses will not materialise. [It
is reasonable to assume that this may also underpin the rather cautious
reactions to the risks associated with the [Trump]{.mark}
administration\'s agenda.]{.underline} Although one cannot complain
about the administration\'s power of initiative, [there is a fairly
**high probability** that **in important areas it [will not go from
words to actions]{.mark}**. There may be [\[for\] **various
reasons**]{.mark} for this, [such as]{.mark} the [inertia]{.mark} built
[in]{.mark}to the **[s]{.mark}**eparation **[o]{.mark}**f
**[p]{.mark}**owers between the White House, Congress and the court
system, [or expectations]{.mark} that Trump\'s newly appointed cabinet
secretaries and [advisors will]{.mark} eventually [take]{.mark} their
[cues from]{.mark} more **[established]{.mark}** US
[positions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- No Manufacturing Impact 

#### Hegemony isn't true -- data is on our side

**Fettweis 11** (Christopher J., Department of Political Science, Tulane
University, "Free Riding or Restraint? Examining European Grand
Strategy", 9/26, Comparative Strategy, 30:316--332, Ebsco)

It is perhaps worth noting that [[there is **no evidence** to support a
direct relationship between the]{.mark} relative [level of U.S. activism
and international stability.]{.mark} In fact, the limited data we do
have suggest **[the opposite may be true]{.mark}**]{.underline}. During
the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defense spending fairly
substantially. [By 1998, the United States was spending \$100 billion
less on defense in real terms than it had in 1990]{.underline}.51
[To]{.underline} internationalists, defense hawks and [believers in
hegemonic stability]{.underline}, [this irresponsible "peace dividend"
endangered both national and global security]{.underline}. "No serious
analyst of American military capabilities," argued Kristol and Kagan,
"doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet
America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace."52 On the other
hand, if the pacific trends were not based upon U.S. hegemony but a
strengthening norm against interstate war, one would not have expected
an increase in global instability and violence. [The verdict from the
past two decades is fairly plain: [The world grew **more peaceful**
while the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[**[S]{.underline}**]{.mark}tates [[cut its forces]{.underline}. [No
state]{.underline} ]{.mark}[seemed to [believe]{.mark} that [its
security was endangered]{.mark} by a less-capable United States
military]{.underline}, or at least none took any action that would
suggest such a belief. [[No militaries were **enhanced to address power
vacuums**]{.mark}, **[no]{.mark}** security dilemmas drove insecurity or
**[arms races, and no regional balancing]{.mark}** occurred]{.underline}
once the stabilizing presence of the U.S. military was diminished. The
rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a
pressing concern, despite the reduction in U.S. capabilities. Most of
all, the United States and its allies were no less safe. The incidence
and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut
its military spending under President Clinton, and kept declining as the
Bush Administration ramped the spending back up. No complex statistical
analysis should be necessary to reach the conclusion that the two are
unrelated. Military spending figures by themselves are insufficient to
disprove a connection between overall U.S. actions and international
stability. Once again, one could presumably argue that spending is not
the only or even the best indication of hegemony, and that it is instead
U.S. foreign political and security commitments that maintain stability.
Since neither was significantly altered during this period, instability
should not have been expected. Alternately, advocates of hegemonic
stability could believe that relative rather than absolute spending is
decisive in bringing peace. Although the United States cut back on its
spending during the 1990s, its relative advantage never wavered.
However, even if it is true that either U.S. commitments or relative
spending account for global pacific trends, then at the very least
stability can evidently be maintained at drastically lower levels of
both. In other words, even if one can be allowed to argue in the
alternative for a moment and suppose that there is in fact a level of
engagement below which the United States cannot drop without increasing
international disorder, a rational grand strategist would still
recommend cutting back on engagement and spending until that level is
determined. Grand strategic decisions are never final; continual
adjustments can and must be made as time goes on. Basic logic suggests
that the United States ought to spend the minimum amount of its blood
and treasure while seeking the maximum return on its investment. And if
the current era of stability is as stable as many believe it to be, no
increase in conflict would ever occur irrespective of U.S. spending,
which would save untold trillions for an increasingly debt-ridden
nation. It is also perhaps worth noting that if opposite trends had
unfolded, if other states had reacted to news of cuts in U.S. defense
spending with more aggressive or insecure behavior, then
internationalists would surely argue that their expectations had been
fulfilled. If increases in conflict would have been interpreted as proof
of the wisdom of internationalist strategies, then logical consistency
demands that the lack thereof should at least pose a problem. As it
stands[, the only evidence we have regarding the likely systemic
reaction to a more restrained **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [suggests that [the current peaceful trends are
unrelated to U.S. military]{.mark} spending]{.underline}. [Evidently
[the rest of the world can **operate quite effectively** without]{.mark}
the presence of a [global policeman]{.mark}. [Those who think otherwise
base their view on **faith alone**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

inability of U.S. defense contractors and laboratories to drive

publisher and producer of the Manufacturing & Technology News, May 20,

Defense from 2009 until 2011, at the April 29, 2015 meeting of the

budgets are combined to total a scant \$3 billion (or only 1.6 percent
of revenue), the five biggest defense contractors --- Boeing, Lockheed,
Raytheon, L3 and Northrop --- would not even make the list of the top 20
global companies that invest in R&D." Lynn told the meeting, "Those are
things where [the commercial industrial base is stronger than the
defense industrial base and in many ways **[the key to maintaining our
future]{.mark} \[[defense]{.mark}\] [tech]{.mark}nology [edge is to be

[It is important not to be hyperbolic about the degradation in the
U.S.-Israeli relationship]{.underline}. A great deal is made about the
antagonistic personal relationship between Netanyahu and U.S. President
Barack Obama. Whether Obama and Netanyahu like each other is immaterial.
The [broader strategic imperatives override personal taste]{.underline}.
And as a result of those imperatives, [the U.S.-Israeli relationship
is]{.underline} in a sense [reverting to]{.underline} what it was---[a
relationship built on strategic need]{.underline}. [That is scary for
Israel because it]{.underline} means it [has lost a degree of
control]{.underline} over U.S. actions, as the Iran deal shows.
[But]{.underline} it also means U.S.-Israeli relations will be based on
shared strategic goals, and while [Israel's importance]{.underline} may
have declined for the United States, it certainly [has not been reduced
to nothing]{.underline}. On the contrary, the U.S. still depends on
Israel for a great deal, and Israel is integral to the balance the U.S.
is trying to construct in the region. [Netanyahu said his piece, but he
recognizes]{.underline} how important [the overall
relationship]{.underline} is [and must now **fall in
line**]{.underline}.

The second observation to make is that [[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[for all its]{.mark} military [strength]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[could
not prevent Iran from]{.mark} developing [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** if Tehran wanted to. In a statement
released immediately after the sanctions were lifted, [Netanyahu said
Israel "will do everything necessary to safeguard its
security]{.underline} and defend itself." [But **[generally Israel has
been all talk]{.mark} when it comes to Iran**]{.underline}, [[like when
it threatened]{.mark} to attack]{.underline} Iranian nuclear sites [[in
2012 or when]{.underline}]{.mark} former Defense Minister and Prime
Minister Ehud [[Barak leaked to Israeli television]{.underline}]{.mark}
in August [that Israel had planned to attack Iran on three separate
occasions before canceling at the last moment]{.underline}.

**[[Israel will no doubt make similar pronouncements in the
future]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and it is not unreasonable for it to do
so. A nuclear Iran does pose an existential threat to Israel---a far
more dangerous one than the Islamic State or a full-scale third
Palestinian intifada. [Israeli leaders must prepare]{.underline} for
what Iran is capable of and not what it hopes Iran will or will not do.
[[But the fact]{.mark} of the matter [is]{.mark} that first]{.underline}
of all, **[[it is unclear that Iran ever actually wanted]{.mark} to
develop [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [so much as]{.underline}
it wanted to [use them as a bargaining chip]{.underline}. Even if Iran
was serious about it, developing deliverable nuclear weapons is
extremely difficult, and being able to enrich uranium to a certain level
of purity does not mean that nuclear capability easily follows.

[Second]{.underline} of all, [[a meaningful Israeli
strike]{.underline}]{.mark} on multiple potential nuclear weapons
facilities in Iran **[[would be close to
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Iran is too far
away]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for]{.underline} the [Israel]{.underline}i
air force [[to attack without forward deploying]{.mark},
which]{.underline} the [Iran]{.underline}ians [would]{.underline} no
doubt [notice]{.underline}. [[The Israelis cannot
know]{.mark}]{.underline} for sure [[where the facilities are,
and]{.mark} even if they had]{.underline} the [correct
intelligence]{.underline}, **[may not have the necessary
weaponry]{.underline}** for attacking underground sites. [To say nothing
of how Israel could confirm]{.underline} that [its strikes]{.underline}
had been successful.

**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[can **no longer

ultimatum is more about controlling the country's global image than
about changing the behavior of its participants. Iran will at least be
able to say that it kept its promises until the bitter end, a point
which may be useful in any future negotiations into which it enters. For
its part, the United States has made it clear that sanctions are in the
offing for any country that engages with Iran economically, and for the
JCPOA participants -- even China, one of Iran's most important oil
buyers -- interacting with Iran is simply not worth the price of having
the U.S. turn on them. (Saudi Arabia has claimed that it will provide
additional supply to Iran's prior customers, and may have up to 2.0-2.5
million barrels per day of spare capacity). No party to the JCPOA
approves of what the U.S. is doing, but none are strong enough to do
anything to stop it, and none has been willing to defy the U.S. by
ensuring its survival. **[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, [[has its

**[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} Iran's
national [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} -- appears increasingly more
valid. Even the Rouhani administration might harbor secret hopes that a
nuclear weapons program might generate the negotiating leverage
necessary to get the U.S. to deal with Iran on a more pragmatic basis.
The moment Iran entered into the JCPOA, it effectively lost its
negotiating leverage with the United States. Iran's nuclear weapons
program brought the U.S. government to the negotiating table once;
perhaps it will bring it to the table again. Considering Washington's
recent approach to North Korea -- namely, face-to-face negotiations
after North Korea started testing intercontinental ballistic missiles --
it is not an unreasonable tactic to attempt. For
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the bigger problem is that it
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[no other tactics
left]{.underline}]{.mark}** to try. [[The U.S. has]{.mark} broken
agreements and [applied **new sanctions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and now
it has deployed a carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the
region](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/the-us-iran-and-a-new-american-deployment-1/).
[[Iran has to **tip the balance**]{.underline}]{.mark} here somehow,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the threat of [[resuming its nuclear weapons

### 2NC -- Iran Prolif Inevitable 

#### Iran will get the bomb inevitably -- they're buckling down on enrichment 

**Ghoshal 19 (Debalina Ghoshal, Research Fellow specializing in nuclear
and missile issues at the Centre for Human Security Studies, February
21, 2019. "Iran\'s enrichment process a huge concern in the region."**
<https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/02/21/irans-enrichment-process-a-huge-concern-in-the-region>**)**

[In **January 2019**]{.underline}, there were reports that **[[Iran\'s
nuclear chief]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Ali Akbar Salehi,
[announced]{.underline} that [Iran was designing a modern process to
enrich uranium up to 20 percent in its 50-year-old reactor]{.underline}.
Salehi, according to a December 2018 report, had stated that Iran was
ready to begin a 20-percent enrichment process at its Fordow nuclear
facility. In 2015, under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),
Iran was eligible to enrich uranium only up to 3.7 percent for 15 years.
But **[Salehi]{.underline}** [[announced]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
concerning issue about Iran when he stated that]{.underline}
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"[[would do]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[enrichment at any volume and level]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" The
United States had called off the 2015 nuclear deal and demanded a fresh
deal. However, Salehi in September 2018, clearly stated, \"If we have to
go back and withdraw from the nuclear deal, we certainly will not go
back to where we were before. We will be standing on a much, much higher
position.\" A new version of nuclear fuel would be capable of enhancing
the efficiency of the reactor and Iran is also now capable of designing
its own reactors that would suit its own needs. [In September 2018,
Ayatollah Ali **[Khamenei]{.mark}**]{.underline} had reportedly
[[ordered]{.underline}]{.mark} [to set up and complete]{.underline} a
very advanced hall for the [[construction of **modern
centrifuges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Salehi\'s claim that Iran would
enrich uranium up to 20 percent is definitely a way for them to
**proceed further in their nuclear program**]{.underline}. In fact, in
August 2017 [Salehi declared that Iran could start enriching uranium up
to 20 percent within five days]{.underline} if it made a determined
effort to do so. Already [in June 2018]{.underline}, [**[Iran]{.mark}**
was reported to have [launched the]{.mark} **[UF-6]{.mark}** (uranium
hexafluoride) **[production facility]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} was a step
toward **increasing its uranium enrichment capability**]{.underline}.
**[UF-6]{.underline}** is the raw material that is used to feed the
centrifuges, which are used for enriching uranium. [Possessing the
ability to enrich uranium up to 20 percent [would]{.mark} also [**open
ways** for Iran to enrich]{.mark} uranium that would be **[weapons
grade]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [One of the pressing issues of the
post-nuclear deal period has been Iran\'s ongoing persistence on a
missile development program]{.underline}. Iran already possesses
sophisticated long-range ballistic and cruise missiles that are capable
of delivering nuclear warheads as well as chemical and biological
warheads and submunitions. [Allowing Tehran to enrich uranium up to 20
percent would only result in the country **furthering the capability**
of developing nuclear weapons]{.underline}. In fact, in June 2018,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[Iranian [government]{.mark}]{.underline}**
had already warned that it [[would develop a **nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[if the deal fell
apart]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not only this, [[it
would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[start a]{.mark} new **[nuclear arms
race in the Middle East]{.mark} and North Africa**]{.underline} region.
Strategic repercussions Saudi Arabia wants to possess nuclear technology
for civil purposes but refuses to accept the U.S. \"gold standard\" of
restricting enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing. Hence, a nuclear
deal with the United States has been a delayed process. [If]{.underline}
**[Tehran]{.underline}** [reaches the]{.underline} claimed [amount
of]{.underline} **[enrichment]{.underline}** for uranium, **[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** would find it difficult to accept the U.S. gold
standard. In addition, countries in the region, especially **[Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Turkey]{.underline}**,
[could also become **high-risk nuclear power states.**]{.underline} The
UAE accepts the U.S. gold standard -- the 123 Agreement -- and refrains
from enriching uranium, but it has always been skeptical of the nuclear
deal that allowed Iran to enrich uranium up to 3.7 percent. The UAE
ambassador to Washington had also stated once that the UAE no longer
felt bound by the 123 Agreement which was a bilateral agreement between
the United States and the UAE. Moreover, [enriching uranium for military
purposes will be against the nuclear deal and in the future, the United
States might find it difficult to persuade other states in the region to
enter into such similar nuclear deals should states in the Middle East
go nuclear.]{.underline} Though Iran has stated that it had no desire to
withdraw from the deal, **[[any attempt]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to
increase enrichment]{.underline}]{.mark} [capacity]{.underline} [[would
**automatically** lead to the nuclear deal]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[becoming]{.mark} **null and [void]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Iran in June
2018, also warned that it would resort to an enrichment process on
uranium, unless the European countries fail to uphold the nuclear deal.
Therefore, the enrichment program is seen as a way to coerce Europe to
stick to the nuclear deal by Iran. The uranium enrichment program will
only make the nuclear energy program in Iran more complicated as there
may not be any future scope to discuss improvisation of the nuclear
deal. In addition, [Iran will be supported in its nuclear energy program
by countries like China and Russia,]{.underline} which makes Iran care
less about the U.S. moving away from the nuclear deal and despite the
actions by U.S. President Donald Trump, Iran would most likely go ahead
with the uranium enrichment program. Though Iran is a party to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has the right to pursue a nuclear
energy program[, its ability to enrich uranium up to 20 percent may in
future lead to a stage where it **enriches uranium that is weapons
grade**]{.underline}. Another threat to anti-agreement countries is Iran
having close ties with Hezbollah -- an asymmetric militant group that
has close ties with Tehran. [**Iran** already transfers weapons and
missile systems to Hezbollah and hence, in the future, it could also
**transfer nuclear weapons or technological know-how to
Hezbollah**]{.underline}. **[[Iran\'s nuclear program, if not checked,
will]{.mark} only [move ahead to become a full-fledged nuclear
program]{.mark} that can develop nuclear weapons [in a short
span]{.mark} of time.]{.underline}**

[**Iran**'s]{.underline} [readiness to stick with the JCPOA so far may
give some]{.underline} in the Trump administration [the impression that
it can **continue indefinitely**]{.underline} [to have the best of both
worlds---Iranian nuclear restraint and U.S. freedom to apply maximum
pressure to compel Tehran to capitulate to its demands]{.underline}. But
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should not take continued Iranian
compliance with the JCPOA for **granted**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has
only been a few months since the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions, and
their full impact is still uncertain. Before making a decision on
whether to stay bound by the JCPOA, the Iranians may be waiting a while
longer to see whether the efforts of the Europeans, Russians, Chinese,
and others to circumvent the U.S. sanctions, as well as Iran's own
coping mechanisms, are sufficient to make the impact of the U.S.
pressure campaign tolerable. An important benchmark will be May 2019,
when the current exceptions to oil sanctions are scheduled to expire.
Depending on how the Trump administration decides to proceed, the
countries that received exceptions in November 2018 may be able to
obtain another exception with only modest additional reductions in oil
imports from Iran, or they may be required to make drastic cuts or even
go to zero in order to avoid sanctions. Brian Hook, the administration's
special envoy on Iran, told Bloomberg in January 2019 that [the
administration]{.underline} is "not looking to grant new waivers" and
[remains **committed**]{.underline} [to get to **zero imports of Iranian
crude**]{.underline}.53 The outcome of the next round of exceptions,
together with the effectiveness of Iran's clandestine efforts to get its
oil to market and the readiness of countries such as China and Russia to
defy **[[U.S. sanctions threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**, will determine
how much crude oil Iran will continue to sell. While Iran's leaders may
believe they can cope with **[oil sales]{.underline}** at roughly 1
million barrels per day, **[reductions]{.underline}** significantly
beyond that level [[would be]{.underline}]{.mark} much more
**[[difficult to tolerate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Every barrel
[that]{.mark} is not sold [means]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[less
money]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[available for]{.mark}
redistribution]{.underline} [[programs intended to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[protect vulnerable populations and to]{.underline} **[[quell political
unrest]{.underline}]{.mark}** at all population strata. [At some
point]{.underline}, though it is difficult to predict exactly when,
[[the **economic pain**]{.underline}]{.mark} of sanctions [[could
become]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[so great]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that
the argument in Tehran that JCPOA compliance]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is
in Iran's **economic interests**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[would **no
longer have credibility**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[That point may]{.mark}
now [be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[close]{.underline}]{.mark}**r than in
the past. Iranian Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali
Shamkhani said on January 7, 2019 that "the Europeans' opportunity to
execute their commitments to our country under the JCPOA ... has
ended."54 As one commentator put it, "[the high ground does not pay the
bills]{.underline}."55

But set aside for the moment all the logical inconsistencies and other
reasons to reject the notion of an Iranian regional marauder as a reason
to oppose the nuclear agreement. [Focus]{.underline} instead [on the
image of an Iran whose current regional policy supposedly is already an
assortment of destructive activities. This image has become]{.underline}
the kind of [conventional wisdom]{.underline} that repeatedly gets
invoked (even, in this instance, by supporters of the nuclear agreement)
[without any felt need]{.underline} by those who invoke it [to provide
any supporting facts or analysis because it is taken for
granted]{.underline} that everyone "knows" it to be true. [The
[references]{.mark} to the image [are]{.mark} almost always [vague and
general, couched in terms of Iran]{.mark} supposedly ["destabilizing"
the Middle East]{.mark} or seeking to "dominate" it or exercise
"hegemony"]{.underline} over it, or that it is "on the march" to take
over the region. [Often there are references to "terrorism" and
"subversion" without anything more specific being offered. Often the
names of conflict-ridden countries in the region are recited, but again
without any specifics as to who is doing what in those
countries]{.underline}. To get away from such uselessly general
accusations, ask: (1) [what exactly is Iran doing in the Middle East
that is of concern; and]{.underline} (2) [how does what Iran is doing
differ from what other states are doing in the same places? **A careful
comparison of this sort leads to the conclusion that
[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}, contrary to the conventional wisdom,
[**[does not stand out]{.mark} in [doing aggressive, destabilizing, or
hegemonic things.]{.mark}** Iran is one of the largest
states]{.underline} in the Middle East [and naturally]{.underline}, as
with any such state, [competes for influence in its region. To try to
keep any such state]{.underline}, be it Iran or any other, [from
competing]{.underline} for such influence [would be futile and damaging
in its own right]{.underline}. [To label Iranian policy as seeking
"hegemony" or "domination" is only that]{.underline}---i.e., [applying a
label]{.underline}---when others are using more forceful and destructive
ways of trying to extend their own influence in the same places.
[[Iran]{.mark},]{.underline} unlike others, [[**has not launched wars**
or **invaded neighboring territory**]{.mark}]{.underline} (except in
counterattacking during the war with Iraq that Saddam Hussein started).
[[Nor has Iran drawn]{.underline}]{.mark}, China-like, [[any nine-dash
lines and asserted unsupported domination]{.mark} over swaths of its own
region.]{.underline} T[he assumption that just about anything Iran does
in the Middle East is contrary to U.S. interests keeps getting made
despite what should be the glaringly obvious counterexample of the war
in Iraq. Iran and the United States are on the same side]{.underline}
there. They both are supporting the government of Iraq in trying to push
back the radical group generally known as ISIS. [Why should Iran's part
of this effort be called part of regional trouble-making, while the U.S.
part of it is given some more benign description]{.underline}? [Those in
the United States]{.underline} who would rather not face that
counterexample [are]{.underline} usually [quick to mutter something
like, "Yes, but the Iranians are doing this for their own malign
purposes of spreading their influence in Iraq]{.underline}." The first
thing to note in response to such muttering is that [if we are worried
about increased Iranian influence in Iraq, that increase is due chiefly
not to anything the Iranians have done but rather to a war of choice
that the **U**nited **S**tates initiated]{.underline}. The next thing is
to ask on behalf of what interests the Iranians would use their
influence in Iraq, and how that relates to U.S. interests. [The
preeminent Iranian objective regarding Iraq is to avoid anything
resembling the incredibly costly Iran-Iraq War, and to have a regime in
Baghdad]{.underline}---preferably friendly to Iran, but at least not
hostile to it---[that would not launch such a conflict
again]{.underline}. **[[Iran]{.mark} also [does not want]{.mark} endless
[instability]{.mark}]{.underline}** along its long western border,
**[and [its leaders]{.mark} are smart enough to [realize]{.mark} that
narrowly prejudicial [sectarian politics are not a prescription for
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [These lines of thinking are
consistent with U.S. interests]{.underline}; it is not only in the
current fight against ISIS that U.S. and Iranian interests converge.
Look carefully also at another conflict-ridden Middle Eastern state
whose name often gets casually invoked: Yemen. Iran and the United
States are not on the same side of this civil war, although [the United
States probably has as much explaining to do as to why it has
taken]{.underline} the side it has---[the same side as Al-Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula, the most capable and threatening Al-Qaeda branch
operating today---as Iran does]{.underline}. [Iran has become identified
with the]{.underline} side of the rebellious [Houthi
movement]{.underline}, although the most prominent Yemeni leader on the
same side as the Houthis is Ali Abdullah Saleh, who as the Yemeni
president for more than thirty years was seen as our guy in Yemen, not
the Iranians' guy. [Iran did not instigate the Houthi rebellion, nor are
the Houthis accurately described as "clients" of Iran much less
"proxies," as they often inaccurately are.]{.underline} **[Instead [Iran
was]{.mark} probably [a source of restraint]{.mark} in [advising]{.mark}
the [Houthis not to capture the capital of Sanaa]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
although the Houthis went ahead and did it anyway. The Iranians probably
are glad to see the Saudis bleed some in Yemen, and whatever aid Tehran
has given to the Houthis was given with that in mind. But [[any such aid
pales in comparison to]{.mark} the extent and destructiveness of the
[Saudis]{.mark}' intervention in Yemen,]{.underline} which has included
aerial assaults that have caused many hundreds of civilian casualties.
In the same vein consider Bahrain, which is an interesting case given
historical Iranian claims to Bahrain and past Iranian activity there.
Despite that background and despite Bahraini government accusations,
there is an absence of reliable evidence of anything in recent years
that could accurately be described as Iranian subversion in Bahrain.
Instead it is again the Saudis who have used forceful methods to exert
their influence on a neighbor, and in this case to prop up an unpopular
Sunni regime in a Shia majority country. The principal Saudi military
intervention in Bahrain came a few years ago, but it was an early shot
in a campaign that has taken fuller shape under King Salman [to use any
available means, including military force, to expand Saudi influence in
the
region](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/world/middleeast/king-salman-upends-status-quo-in-region-and-the-royal-family.html?_r=0).
If there is a Persian Gulf power that has been using damaging methods to
try to become a regional hegemon, it is Saudi Arabia, not Iran. The
Saudis could claim to be acting on behalf of a status quo in Bahrain and
Yemen, but then what about Syria, where it is Iran that is backing the
existing regime? And as perhaps the most germane question, [how can any
one of the outside players that have mucked into that incredibly
complicated civil war be singled out as a destabilizing regional
marauder while the others]{.underline} (some of whom, such as the United
States and Israel, have conducted their own airstrikes in the country)
[be given the benefit of more benign labeling? Iran did not start the
Syrian war.]{.underline} [And each of the most significant
sides]{.underline} fighting that war [are dominated by]{.underline} what
we normally would consider [certifiable bad guys]{.underline}: the Assad
regime, ISIS, and an Islamist coalition led by the local Al-Qaeda
branch[. It is hard to see a clear and convincing basis for parceling
out benign and malign labeling here when it comes to the outside
players]{.underline}. [Then of course there is the rest of the Levantine
part of the region]{.underline}, including Palestine; the aid
relationships that Iran has had with the H groups---Hezbollah and
Hamas---are continually invoked in any litany of Iranian regional
activity. Lebanese Hezbollah certainly is still an important ally of
Iran, although it has long since become strong enough to outgrow any
Iranian hand-holding. We should never forget that prior to 9/11
Hezbollah was the group that had more U.S. blood on its hands through
terrorism than any other group. We also should understand that Hezbollah
has become a major player in Lebanese politics in a way in which many in
the region, including its immediate political opponents, accept it as a
legitimate political actor. Right now as a military actor it is deeply
involved in the effort to support the Syrian regime, and it is not
looking to stir up any new wars or instability anywhere else. Hamas has
never been anything remotely resembling a proxy of Iran, although it has
accepted, somewhat reluctantly, Iranian aid in the absence of other
help. To Iran, Hamas represents Palestinian resistance to Israeli
occupation of (or blockading and subjugation of) Palestinian territory,
without being an accessory to that occupation, which is how the
Palestinian Authority is widely seen. Hamas is the winner of the last
free Palestinian election, and it has repeatedly made clear that its
ambition is to hold political power among Palestinians and that it is
willing to maintain a long-term truce with Israel. Right now Hamas is
trying, unfortunately with only partial success, to keep small groups
from overturning the current cease-fire with rocket firings into Israel.
Again, [none of this is a conflict that Iran has instigated or that Iran
is stirring up or escalating. Iran is not the cause of the instability
that already reigns]{.underline}. And the broader opposition to
continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is opposition that
Iran shares with many others, including the whole Arab world. As long as
we are looking at this part of the region, [it is impossible to escape
notice that Iran does not hold a candle to Israel when it comes to
forcefully throwing weight around in the neighborhood in damaging and
destabilizing ways, even without]{.underline} considering the
[occupation of the West Bank]{.underline}. This has included multiple
armed invasions of neighboring territory as well as other actions, such
as the attack on Iraq years ago that stimulated Iraq to speed up its
program to develop nuclear weapons. And before we leave the Middle East
as a whole, [it also is impossible to escape notice that the single most
destabilizing action in the region over the past couple of decades was
the U.S. launch of a war of aggression in Iraq]{.underline} in 2003.
Iran certainly has done nothing like that. [[The ritualistically
repeated notion]{.mark} that [Iran is wreaking instability]{.mark} all
over the region **[is a badly mistaken myth]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
There are important respects in which Iranian policies and actions do
offend U.S. interests, but p[rotection of those interests is not helped
by perpetuating myths. Perpetuation of this particular myth has several
deleterious effects]{.underline}. The most immediate and obvious one is
to corrupt debate over the nuclear deal. Another is [to foster broader
misunderstanding about Iranian behavior and intentions that threatens to
corrupt debate over other issues as well. Yet another consequence
involves a failure to understand fully that every state competes for
influence. Such efforts to compete are called *foreign
policy*]{.underline}. It would be in our own interests for other states
to wage that competition through peaceful and legitimate means. [By
misrepresenting who is doing what]{.underline}, and through what means,
in the Middle East today, [the myth about Iranian behavior maintains a
constituency for [isolating and ostracizing Iran]{.mark}---**which
[makes it less]{.mark}**, not more, **[likely]{.mark} that
[Iran]{.mark}**, so ostracized, **[will use peaceful]{.mark} and
[legitimate means]{.mark} to pursue its interests in the
future.**]{.underline}

#### Nuclear proliferation solves Middle East instability 

**Waltz 12** (Kenneth, Senior Research Scholar at the Saltzman Institute
of War and Peace Studies and Adjunct Professor of Political Science at
Columbia University, \"Why Iran should get the bomb,\" July,
https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2012/07/20/kenneth-waltz-why-iran-should-get-the-bomb)

The third possible outcome is that Iran continues its current course and
publicly goes nuclear by testing a weapon. U.S. and Israeli officials
have declared that outcome unacceptable, arguing that a nuclear Iran is
a uniquely terrifying prospect, even an existential threat. Such
language is typical of major powers, which have historically gotten
riled up whenever another country has begun to develop a nuclear weapon
of its own. Yet so far, every time another country has managed to
shoulder its way into the nuclear club, the other members have always
changed tack and decided to live with it. In fact, **[by reducing
imbalances in military power, new nuclear states generally produce more
regional and international stability, not less.]{.underline}**
[[Israel's]{.mark} regional [nuclear monopoly]{.mark}]{.underline},
which has proved remarkably durable for the past four decades, **[has
long [fuel]{.mark}ed [instability]{.mark} in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. In no other region of the world does a lone,
unchecked nuclear state exist. It [is Israel's nuclear arsenal, not
Iran's desire for one, that has **contributed most** to the current
crisis]{.underline}. Power, after all, begs to be balanced. What is
surprising about the Israeli case is that it has taken so long for a
potential balancer to emerge. Of course, it is easy to understand why
Israel wants to remain the sole nuclear power in the region and why it
is willing to use force to secure that status. In 1981, Israel bombed
Iraq to prevent a challenge to its nuclear monopoly. It did the same to
Syria in 2007 and is now considering similar action against Iran. But
[the very acts that have allowed [Israel]{.mark} to maintain its
[nuclear edge]{.mark} in the short term have prolonged an imbalance that
[is unsustainable]{.mark} in the long term]{.underline}. Israel's proven
ability to strike potential nuclear rivals with impunity has inevitably
made its enemies eager to develop the means to prevent Israel from doing
so again. In this way, [the current [tensions]{.mark} are best viewed
not as the early stages of a relatively recent Iranian nuclear crisis
but rather as the final stages of a decades-long Middle East nuclear
crisis **that [will end]{.mark} only [when a balance of]{.mark} military
[power is restored.]{.mark}**]{.underline} One reason the danger of a
nuclear Iran has been grossly exaggerated is that the debate surrounding
it has been distorted by misplaced worries and fundamental
misunderstandings of how states generally behave in the international
system. The first prominent concern, which undergirds many others, is
that the Iranian regime is innately irrational. Despite a widespread
belief to the contrary, [Iranian policy is made not by "mad mullahs" but
by perfectly sane ayatollahs who want to survive]{.underline} just like
any other leaders. Although [[Iran]{.mark}'s leaders]{.underline}
indulge in inflammatory and hateful rhetoric, they [[show no propensity
for self-destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would be a grave error for
policymakers in the United States and Israel to assume otherwise. Yet
that is precisely what many U.S. and Israeli officials and analysts have
done. Portraying Iran as irrational has allowed them to argue that the
logic of nuclear deterrence does not apply to the Islamic Republic. If
Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, they warn, it would not hesitate to use
it in a first strike against Israel, even though doing so would invite
massive retaliation and risk destroying everything the Iranian regime
holds dear. Although it is impossible to be certain of Iranian
intentions, [it is far more likely that if Iran desires nuclear weapons,
it is for the purpose of providing for its own security, not to improve
its offensive capabilities]{.underline} (or destroy itself). Iran may be
intransigent at the negotiating table and defiant in the face of
sanctions, but it still acts to secure its own preservation.
Nevertheless, even some [observers and policymakers who accept that the
Iranian regime is rational still worry that a nuclear weapon would
embolden it, providing Tehran with a shield that would allow it to act
more aggressively and increase its support for terrorism. The problem
with these concerns is that they **contradict the record of every other
nuclear weapons state going back to 1945**]{.underline}. History shows
that when countries acquire the bomb, they feel increasingly vulnerable
and become acutely aware that their nuclear weapons make them a
potential target in the eyes of major powers. This awareness discourages
nuclear states from bold and aggressive action. [Maoist China, for
example, became much less bellicose after acquiring nuclear weapons in
1964, and India and Pakistan have both become more cautious since going
nuclear. There is little reason to believe Iran would break this
mold.]{.underline} Another oft-touted worry is that if Iran obtains the
bomb, other states in the region will follow suit, leading to a nuclear
arms race in the Middle East. But [the nuclear age is now almost 70
years old, and so far, fears of proliferation have proved to be
unfounded.]{.underline} Properly defined, the term "proliferation" means
a rapid and uncontrolled spread. Nothing like that has occurred; in
fact, since 1970, there has been a marked slowdown in the emergence of
nuclear states. [There is no reason to expect that this pattern will
change now. Should [Iran]{.mark} become the second Middle Eastern
[nuclear power]{.mark}]{.underline} since 1945, **[it would [hardly
signal]{.mark} the start of [a landslide]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
Israel acquired the bomb [in the 1960s]{.underline}, it was at war with
many of its neighbors. Its nuclear arms were a much bigger threat to the
Arab world than Iran's program is today. [If an [atomic Israel did not
trigger an arms race]{.mark}]{.underline} then, [**there is no reason a
nuclear Iran should now.**]{.underline} In 1991, historical rivals
[India and Pakistan]{.underline} signed a treaty agreeing not to target
each other's nuclear facilities. They realized that far more worrisome
than their adversary's nuclear deterrent was the instability produced by
challenges to it. Since then, [even in the face of high tensions and
risky provocations]{.underline}, the two countries **[have kept the
peace]{.underline}**. Israel and Iran would do well to consider this
precedent. **[[If Iran goes nuclear, Israel and Iran will deter each
other]{.mark}, as nuclear powers always have]{.underline}**. **[There
has never been a full-scale war between two nuclear-armed
states.]{.underline}** Once Iran crosses the nuclear threshold,
deterrence will apply, even if the Iranian arsenal is relatively small.
[No other country in the region will have an incentive to acquire its
own nuclear capability, and the current crisis will finally dissipate,
**[leading to a Middle East that is]{.mark} more [stable]{.mark} than it
is today**.]{.underline} For that reason, the United States and its
allies need not take such pains to prevent the Iranians from developing
a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy between Iran and the major powers should
continue, because open lines of communication will make the Western
countries feel better able to live with a nuclear Iran. But the current
sanctions on Iran can be dropped: They primarily harm ordinary Iranians,
with little purpose. Most important, policymakers and citizens in the
Arab world, Europe, Israel and the United States should take comfort
from the fact that **[history has shown that where nuclear capabilities
emerge, so, too, does stability]{.underline}**. **[When it comes to
nuclear weapons, now as ever, more may be better]{.underline}**.

A nuclear-armed Iran is not likely to act much differently. Most

importance to hydrocarbon supplies, robust conventional forces, ability

#### Iranian aggression from proliferation is all rhetoric---leaders have incentive to hold back nuclear power

Iran\'s possession of a nuclear weapon would be a troubling and
disturbing development, especially for the future of the
nonproliferation regime and for stability in the Middle East. However,
[there is reason to believe that [Iran\'s]{.mark} theoretical
[possession of a nuclear weapon would not]{.mark} profoundly
[alter]{.mark} the essence of [its foreign policy.]{.mark} [Iran\'s
foreign policy,]{.mark}]{.underline} both [before and after the 1979
revolution, [has been]{.mark}]{.underline} largely
[[pragmatic]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly [[in action if not always
in rhetoric.]{.underline}]{.mark} Though it has miscalculated the
effects of and reactions to its policies, as well as adopted violence as
a tool to achieve its strategic goals, [Iran\'s policies have generally
been conceived with rational security objectives in mind. The
hypothetical [development of]{.mark} a [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} capability [[would not]{.underline}]{.mark}
fundamentally [[alter Iran\'s]{.mark} overriding foreign policy
[objective\--regime security.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Iran\'s
leaders,]{.underline}]{.mark} like those in other states, [[want to
remain in power.]{.mark} They want the regime in which they have
invested and which serves their interests to endure. Foreign policy, in
addition to safeguarding Iran\'s borders and national integrity, is a
means for safeguarding the regime.]{.underline} Possession of a nuclear
weapon will likely make Iran more impervious to attack and may make Iran
bolder in its support for armed groups. However, possessing a nuclear
weapon will is not likely to alter Iran\'s paramount foreign policy
goals of national and regime security. Further, [[possession of a
nuclear weapon is likely to cause Iran\'s isolation from the
international community,]{.underline}]{.mark} an outcome Iran does not
want. [[Iran would]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [be likely to [use any
advantages of possessing a nuclear weapon in a way that would
not]{.mark} significantly [increase its international isolation]{.mark}
even further.]{.underline} The Islamic Republic is not an irrational or
suicidal regime. A nuclear weapon will not make it one.

for the U.S. to use Taiwan as leverage in dealing with those issues,
e.g. telling China to modulate its positions favorably for the U.S. in

president-elect, Donald Trump [mused about doing exactly
that](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/11/us/politics/trump-taiwan-one-china.html),
and as the trade dispute heats up, that temptation will grow. **[That
would be a significant mistake.]{.underline}** [[Taiwan has been
a]{.mark} **steadfast supporter**]{.underline} [of the U.S. for
decades,]{.underline} [and continues to perform as a **[staunch

Beijing's intent and attitude --- China has no interest in a deal
involving Taiwan. The claim to the island is the ultimate red line in
its foreign policy, and it is especially true that a nationalist
government like Xi's will not be part of a negotiation involving
Taiwan's status. The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
[must]{.underline} come to understand the overarching importance China
places on eventually incorporating Taiwan into its governance structure,
and display sophistication and strategic patience with the situation.
This means [follow]{.underline}ing [the approach to Taiwan that has been
in place for **decades** with bipartisan support]{.underline}:
[helping]{.underline} [**Taiwan** militarily]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} sensible levels of **[advanced military
sales]{.underline}** [following the mandate of the [Taiwan Relations
Act](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-taiwan-relations-act/)]{.underline};
providing political support internationally, such as helping Taiwan
participate in international organizations even though it is not
universally recognized as a sovereign state; and encouraging robust
economic exchanges between the two nations. Good examples of this are
the recent sale of \$1.4 billion in advanced military hardware that was
announced in 2017, and allowing high-level official visits between the
Taiwan and the U.S. as permitted under the [Taiwan Travel
Act](https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-travel-act/4302881.html), which
was passed this spring. The U.S. should also encourage allies, partners
and friends in the Indo-Pacific region to engage with Taiwan. Having
better economic ties, and perhaps joint military training, between
Taiwan and India, Japan and especially the nations around the littoral
of the South China Sea would help maintain a balance between the
People's Republic and Taiwan. So long as China sees that Taiwan has
robust relations in the region it is unlikely to do anything precipitous
that could provoke a military confrontation. During my recent visit,
which was sponsored by both a U.S. and a Taiwanese think tank, I met
with many senior officials from the government, military and private
sector. The general tone is that Taiwan wants to stay cautious, balanced
and sensible in its approach, and is clearly looking for peaceful
outcomes. I heard from Taiwanese leaders that they don't want to fight
China, and they value a status quo that provides them the benefits of
democracy and free markets. But they are nervous as they see China
ratcheting up pressure militarily, diplomatically and economically. Over
time, the choices ahead about the status of Taiwan must be made by the
people of Taiwan, without fear or favor in reaction to pressure from
across the strait. [The **[Trump]{.mark}** administration [is]{.mark}
**[so far]{.mark}** [taking a **sensible approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} supporting the island and [[providing

Taiwan as a bargaining chip with China. While undermining Taiwan in that
way could provide some short-term relief on knotty problems between the

#### US commitments are at a breaking for NATO perception--- that's key to deter Russian aggression in the Baltics

**Burns 4/3** (Nicholas Burns is a Former Secretary of State for Public
Affairs), "Does the US need NATO?",
https://qz.com/1585911/does-the-us-need-nato/)

NATO states soldiers of Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S.
stand to attention. REUTERS/WOLFGANG RATTAY NATO is facing one of its
most difficult crises in seven decades. UNITED WE STAND Does the US need
NATO? Nicholas Burns By Nicholas BurnsApril 3, 2019 I served as US
ambassador to NATO from 2001 until 2005 during the administration of
President George W. Bush. NATO remains our most important alliance. It
is an irreplaceable asset for the security of the United States. We must
do everything possible to work with Canada and the European allies to
strengthen it for the many challenges ahead. **[NATO is facing, however,
one of its most difficult crises in seven decades. It is not a crisis of
military strength or readiness. The alliance is preserving the peace in
Europe and containing an assertive Russia. It is not a crisis of
relevance. NATO troops continue to serve in Afghanistan, in the fight
against the Islamic State, in preserving the peace in Kosovo and in
providing security in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Black Sea, Baltic Sea
and Balkan regions. It is assisting the EU in managing the migration
crisis through its maritime capacity]{.underline}**. **[The allies also
remain with us in NATO's most important mission---the defense of free,
democratic countries in North America and Europe. The crisis is one of
allied trust and confidence in America's leadership of
NATO.]{.underline}** During the eighteen months of the Trump
administration, the president's personal leadership of NATO has been
called into question on several key fronts. For the first time in NATO's
seven-decade history, there is growing concern about an American
president's commitment to the alliance. President Donald Trump's
repeated public doubts about NATO's importance to the US have had a
highly negative impact on European leaders and European public opinion.
For the first time in NATO's seven-decade history, there is growing
concern in Europe and Canada about an American president's commitment to
the alliance. **[The US has been the acknowledged leader of NATO since
its founding in Washington DC in 1949. As the strongest ally, the US has
always played an outsized role within the alliance. While differences
among allies are normal and criticism of each other is warranted on
serious issues, our presidents also need to project confidence in NATO
and its member states in order to deter potential aggressors such as
Russia and provide the leadership that alliances need to stick
together.]{.underline}** As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump
called NATO "obsolete". As president, he refused to confirm his support
for NATO's Article 5 security guarantee at this first NATO Summit
meeting in 2017. He has suggested that US support for our allies will be
conditioned on the level of their defense spending. While rightly
pushing allies to meet their defense budget commitment of 2% of GDP, he
proposed impulsively at the recent summit a doubling of that goal to
4%---a level the US had never discussed before with the allies and is
itself unprepared to meet. This crisis has been exacerbated by the
contrast between the president's negative public comments about allied
leaders chancellor Angela Merkel and prime minister Theresa May with his
refusal to utter a word of criticism of Russian president Vladimir
Putin, NATO's most dangerous adversary, before, during or after their
recent Helsinki press conference. The president did not criticize Putin
publicly for his annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of Eastern
Ukraine, Russia's nerve agent attack against the UK, its support for the
Asad regime in Syria, and its cyber assault on our 2016 elections. The
president's performance in Helsinki was weak and submissive. The
president was also ambivalent in a prominent interview following the
Helsinki Summit about whether the US would meet our Article 5 security
obligations to Montenegro, the smallest and newest member of NATO, and a
victim of an attempted Russian-inspired coup just two years ago.
REUTERS/JONATHAN ERNST Words matter in diplomacy. **[Words matter in
diplomacy. NATO's ability to deter Russia and other potential foes has
always rested on the strength and clarity of American
presidents,]{.underline}** starting with Harry Truman. President Trump
is the first president to equivocate on the issue of America's
commitment to the security of our allies. Such lack of resolve concerns
allies who worry the US may not be prepared to defend a NATO member from
Russian aggression. **[As the NATO leader, the US President must remain
strong and clear about our resolve in order to reassure allies and to
deter political foes.]{.underline}** Finally, the president is seen by
many Europeans as more committed to authoritarian leaders in Hungary,
Poland, and Italy than democratic leaders such as Merkel. Based on
recent visits to four European countries this summer, I believe allied
governments are most concerned by the rise of extreme anti-democratic
forces in their countries. They would welcome rhetorical support from
the US in their battle to preserve the rule of law and democratic
freedoms. They have not received it. The crisis in NATO today is not the
first the US has had with the allies and likely will not be the last.
The US disavowed the actions of France and the UK in the Suez Crisis of
1956. The US and some of the allies argued about the deployment of
American nuclear missiles to Europe in the early 1980s. We experienced a
major division within the alliance over the Iraq War in 2003 when I was
ambassador to NATO. In none of these crises, however, did the US and the
allies question each other's basic commitment to NATO itself. This is
what is happening now. It makes this crisis different from those in the
past. As a result, a dangerous breach of trust has opened across the
Atlantic. The former Polish defense and foreign minister, Radek
Sikorski, a friend of America, summed up the fear of many in Europe
after the Helsinki Summit when he said publicly, "We have no idea what
president Trump would do in a crisis with Russia." Such a situation is a
gift to Putin whose strategic aim is to weaken NATO and to divide it
from within. It has also caused some Europeans to prepare for a future
without a strong US presence in NATO. The debate in Germany has already
begun with some outside the government advocating the country consider
creating its own nuclear deterrent if it cannot count on the US. The
role of Congress **[Barring a fundamental change in president Trump's
attitude toward NATO as well as Russia, this crisis calls for concerted
action by Congress to revive and reinforce American leadership in the
alliance]{.underline}**. The Senate's overwhelming vote to reaffirm the
US commitment to NATO before the recent Summit was received very
positively in Europe. The recent Menendez-Portman resolution condemning
Russia's annexation of Crimea was another important step to assert
Congressional authority. The proposed McCain-Kaine bill to give Congress
a voice and role in any decision by the administration to reduce US
force strength in Europe or to withdraw from NATO is now a critical next
step for Congress to take. The Senate ratified the Washington Treaty
with a two-thirds majority in 1949. No president should be able to walk
away from that commitment unilaterally without the advice and consent of
the Senate. The Graham-Menendez bill would be an effective way to
counter Putin by strengthening sanctions against Russia and providing
greater support to democracies at risk. These are among the most
important measures Congress can take at a time when the President's
basic commitment to NATO appears so tenuous. Congress can also help to
convince the American public that NATO remains vital for our own
security at home. Until president Trump's election, most polls showed
strong support for NATO among Americans. We should be concerned that the
president's constant belittlement of NATO before American audiences may
diminish public support for an alliance that cannot be truly effective
without the allegiance of our citizens. NATO's Value to the United
States In my judgment, NATO continues to be of vital importance to
American security interests in five principal ways. NATO is at the core
of one of the most significant foreign policy accomplishments in
American history. First, NATO is at the core of one of the most
significant foreign policy accomplishments in American history---the
creation of a long-term peace in Europe following the close of World War
II. Because of NATO and the emergence of the European Union, Europe is
united after centuries of division and war. NATO's military strength has
been a major reason for the absence of war with the Soviet Union and
Russia since 1949. A recent Atlantic Council study reminds that America
spent 14.1% of its GDP on defense during World War I, 37.5% during World
War II ,and 13.2% during the Korean Conflict. We spend nothing close to
those levels now in large part due to the great power peace we have
enjoyed for over seventy years. NATO has been a major factor in that
peace. And due to the expansion of NATO and the EU eastward after the
fall of the Soviet Union, millions of East Europeans now live in free,
democratic societies---a significant success for US diplomacy. Second,
NATO delivers additional benefits to US military objectives and
operations beyond our shores. NATO is at the heart of our defense of
North America and Europe from nuclear and conventional threats. British
and French nuclear weapons join ours in deterring aggression in the
North Atlantic area. Since the late 1940s, every administration has
believed that the best way to defend our country is through American
forces forward deployed in Europe with the NATO allies. This strategy
remains right for today given Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008, of
Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and its current pressure on Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. NATO remains our primary vehicle for
deterring Putin in Eastern Europe. The NATO allies host a great number
of critical bases for US forces---Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in Italy,
Rota in Spain, Souda Bay in Greece, and Incirlik in Turkey---that serve
as a platform for our presence in Europe, as well as for US force
projection against terrorist groups in North Africa and the Middle East
and for our continued military operations in Afghanistan. Europe is a
critical link in the development of our Ballistic Missile Defense
network focused on the Middle East with Turkey, Romania, Poland,
Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK and other allies all
hosting elements of this system. NATO allies continue to participate in
the US-led coalition against the Islamic State in the Middle East. Many
of the allies play lead roles in other counter terror operations such as
French forces in Mali supported by the US In Afghanistan, NATO allies
remain with us in combat operations and in training the Afghan military.
Over 1,000 soldiers from European and other partner nations have died
there during the last 17 years. NATO continues to maintain the
hard-earned peace in Kosovo with European troops bearing the large share
of the burden. An EU-led force has taken on all of the peacekeeping
responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the US for other activities. Third,
the NATO allies are among our closest and most supportive global
partners as we confront the great transnational challenges that define
this century---the fight against terrorism, the entire complex of cyber
threats, climate change, the risk of pandemics, mass migration, and
others. The NATO allies and our partners in the EU act together with us
on these and other issues. This is of incalculable benefit to the US.
Neither Russia nor China have treaty allies. NATO is a significant
advantage for the US when it acts as a force multiplier for American
interests. Fourth, the great majority of the NATO allies are also
members of the EU. Every US president has seen the EU as a strategic
partner. After all, the EU is our largest trade partner and largest
investor in the American economy. Our combined economic might has been a
major reason for the effectiveness of sanctions against both Russia and
Iran in recent years. While we also compete with the EU in trade,
previous presidents have worked hard to prevent those differences from
overwhelming our military and political ties to the EU countries. Fifth
and most importantly, European countries are our most faithful partners
in promoting and preserving democracy in the world today. The strongest
link we share with the NATO allies is one of values---our mutual
commitment to "democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law" as the
Washington Treaty states. At a time when democracies are being
challenged around the world and when anti-democratic populists are on
the rise in several European countries, this link with Europe is vital
to the US. The sad irony in NATO's current crisis of trust is that the
alliance has made significant progress in many areas. REUTERS/DAVID
MDZINARISHVILI US marines and Georgian soldiers take part in a joint
military exercise with NATO members called "Agile Spirit 2015." Alliance
defense spending has been on an upward trend since Putin's invasion of
Crimea in 2014. But there is no doubt that president Trump's persistent
campaign to convince allies to raise defense spending has also had an
important impact. And allies such as Germany must not only raise their
defense spending levels but also reform their militaries to achieve a
far greater capacity to be more effective militarily. The recent NATO
Summit Declaration noted substantial positive progress starting with
four years of real growth in allied defense budgets. Two thirds of the
allies have plans to reach 2% of GDP by the target date of 2024. More
than half of the allies currently spend more than 20% of their military
budgets on defense technology and research and development. NATO expects
that twenty-four of the allies will reach the 20% level by 2024. The sad
irony in NATO's current crisis of trust is that the alliance has made
significant progress in many areas. In addition, NATO agreed at the
recent summit to expand its readiness to deploy forces and to create two
new commands that should add to its operational strength. Together with
the deployment of a battalion of troops each to Poland, Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania, much has been done during the Obama and Trump
administrations to beef up NATO's armored presence to deter Russia and
other potential foes. Secretaries Jim Mattis and Mike Pompeo and
Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutcheson are all respected for their
professionalism and dedication to NATO. These positive developments have
been obscured, unfortunately, by president Trump's persistent criticism
of allied leaders, his lack of criticism of Putin, and his publicly
expressed doubts about his adherence to Article 5 of the Washington
Treaty. If the president is unwilling to change course and to be a more
positive and effective leader of NATO, Congress will have the
responsibility to take the kind of measures I highlighted in the first
part of my testimony. NATO for America I saw the true value of allies
first-hand on 9/11 as a new American ambassador to NATO. After the US
was attacked in New York and at the Pentagon, the Canadian and European
ambassadors to NATO let me know within hours that their governments were
willing to come to our defense. On the following morning, NATO invoked
Article 5 for the first time in history. The allies stood up to defend
us. They decided that Osama Bin Laden's attack on the US was an attack
on them as well. All of them deployed forces to Afghanistan with us.
They remain with us there today 17 years later. This is the true meaning
of NATO for America. That experience convinced me that, despite our
extraordinary power, the US is far stronger and better able to protect
our own country by working in alliance with Canada and European
countries. For this reason and others, the US needs to act quickly and
resolutely to revive, repair and restore American leadership at NATO.
Congress can help to achieve that worthy aim on behalf of the American
people. This article is an edited version of testimony given by Nicholas
Burns (pdf) to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the value of

was a danger Vladimir **[Putin could try to use his armies to invade and

His comments follow a clash between London and Moscow after the Defence
Secretary, Michael Fallon, said **[there was a \"real and present
danger\" Mr Putin could try to destabilise the Baltic states with a
campaign of subversion and irregular warfare.]{.underline}** The Kremlin
called those comments "absolutely unacceptable\". Sir Adrian told the
Royal United Services' Institute there was a danger such a campaign of
undercover attacks could paralyse NATO decision making, as members
disagreed over how much Russia was responsible, and how to respond. NATO
commanders fear a campaign of skilfully disguised, irregular military
action by Russia, which is carefully designed not to trigger the
alliance\'s mutual defence pact. **[He said the \"resulting ambiguity\"
would make \"collective decisions relating to the appropriate responses
more difficult\".]{.underline}** But Sir Adrian, one of the most senior
generals in the British Army and a former director of special forces,
went further and said there was also danger that Russia could use
conventional forces and Soviet-era brinkmanship to seize NATO territory.
**[He said Russia had shown last year it could generate large
conventional forces at short notice for snap exercises along its
borders. There was a danger these could be used "not only for
intimidation and coercion but potentially to seize NATO territory, after
which the threat of escalation might be used to prevent re-establishment
of territorial integrity]{.underline}**. This use of so called
**[escalation dominance was]{.underline}** of course **[a classic Soviet
technique]{.underline}**." He went on to say that "**[the threat from

**Shaffer 2/6** (Anthony Shaffer is a retired U.S. Army Reserve
lieutenant colonel and is currently senior fellow for the London Center
for Policy Research.), "NATO Is Now Stronger Than Ever",
https://www.theepochtimes.com/nato-is-now-stronger-than-ever_2789914.html)

**[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is now stronger than
ever]{.underline}**. What was a Cold War relic is now returned to
service with renewed vigor and teeth. ADVERTISING **[Take it from NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg himself, who said that President
Trump's pressure on European allies to meet their military funding
commitments has had "real results."]{.underline}** "President Donald
Trump is having an impact," Stoltenberg told Fox News in a Sunday
morning interview. In all, Stoltenberg continued, "by the end of next
year, **[NATO allies will add \$100 billion extra toward defense. So we
see some real money and some real results. And we see that the clear
message from President Donald Trump is having an impact." When asked if
he was concerned that President Trump's tough rhetoric might be "helping
Putin splinter NATO," Stoltenberg said the exact opposite is happening.
"What I see is that actually NATO is united because we are able to adapt
to deliver," he explained. "North America and Europe are doing more
together now than before."]{.underline}** For context, U.S. defense
spending amounted to just under \$686 billion in 2017, equating to 3.6
percent of GDP. By comparison, Germany spent around \$45 billion on its
armed forces last year, or 1.2 percent of GDP. Start My \$1 Month Trial
For years, our NATO allies in Europe have shortchanged the system and
relied on the United States to foot most of the bill for our mutual
defense, but President Trump shocked the elites of Washington and
Brussels by demanding that those countries actually meet their pledges
to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense. President Trump declared
during the 2018 NATO summit that the United States will no longer
tolerate other member states spending only a little more than 1 percent
of their GDP on defense while the United States "in actual numbers is
paying 4.2 percent of a much larger GDP," saying this is not fair to
U.S. taxpayers and "we're not going to put up with it." While some
European diplomats initially reacted to the President's pronouncement
with outrage, it's now clear that his strategy is bearing fruit. **[The
biggest loser in all this is Russia---a country that spent just \$66.3
billion on defense in 2017, a 17 percent decline from the previous year
and the first year-over-year drop since 1998.]{.underline}** That means
the \$100 billion in new defense spending promised by our NATO allies in
Europe is nearly double that of Russia's entire 2017 budget.
**[President Trump is an effective negotiator---proof's in the pudding
so to speak. Despite political criticism]{.underline}** (most of it free
of facts) **[both at home and abroad, his insistence that our allies
meet their spending commitments has made NATO stronger than it's been
for years.]{.underline}** His policy is strength. His Reaganesque view
of security is necessary. His goals of protecting the interests of the
United States and our allies are being realized. Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer

#### The US has consistently invested in NATO to maintain its stability -- Trump's presidency has only cemented that

[Trump's diatribes are not the only cause of the unease.]{.underline} A
broadening chorus of [realist
strategists](http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/opinion/trump-aside-whats-the-us-role-in-nato.html)
claims that the United States is overdue for a major strategic
retrenchment and that it is past time for Europe to tend its own garden.
[Even staunch defenders of NATO express doubts about its future.
[Some](http://www.gmfus.org/publications/global-shift-how-west-should-respond-rise-china)
worry that the growing U.S. preoccupation with East Asia will lure the
United States away from its Atlantic calling and generate transatlantic
tensions over how to deal with the rise of China]{.underline}.
[[Others](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/new-report-focuses-nato-seventy-alliance-crisis)
fear that [democratic backsliding among
members](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-06-14/natos-enemies-within)
is compromising the alliance's values-based solidarity]{.underline}.
[Close NATO
watchers](http://nato.usmission.gov/february-13-2018-press-briefing-ambassador-kay-bailey-hutchison/)
are concerned that EU efforts to more deeply integrate European foreign
and defense policy could ultimately
[weaken](http://twitter.com/NileGardiner/status/964506710890205184) the
Atlantic link. [And debate rages on both sides of the Atlantic as to
whether NATO enlargement has enhanced or eroded European stability and
whether to continue expansion despite the costs to the West's
relationship with Russia. **These worries are unwarranted: NATO at 70 is
actually in remarkably good shape**]{.underline}. [Yes, European allies
have been laggards on defense spending, and some members---Hungary,
Poland, and Turkey in particular---have tarnished democratic
credentials. **But NATO has demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt
to the changing geopolitical environment since the Cold War's end**,
ensuring that the United States and Europe remain each other's go-to
partners.]{.underline} The alliance opened its doors to the new
democracies that emerged from the former Soviet bloc, helping to anchor
security and democracy in a wider Europe. Since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014, members have taken important steps to strengthen
deterrence against the Kremlin's adventurism. [NATO has struck
partnerships across the globe and carried out ambitious missions well
beyond the territory of member states]{.underline}---most notably in the
Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya. All the while, the alliance has
retooled to address new hazards such as cyberthreats, terrorism, hybrid
warfare, and migration[. Precisely because NATO has been so nimble and
effective, it enjoys strong political support on both sides of the
Atlantic, leaving Trump virtually alone as a vociferous
critic]{.underline}. Moreover---and paradoxically---**[Trump's withering
attacks on the alliance are actually strengthening NATO]{.underline}**.
[Defenders of the alliance are coming out of the woodwork, especially in
the U.S. Congress. Trump's regular haranguing of allies for insufficient
defense spending is paying off: Europeans are finally investing more in
their militaries, making it only more likely that the United States will
cleave to Europe as its partner of choice. And Trump's skepticism toward
NATO expansion could help resolve continuing controversy over
enlargement, guiding allies to the sensible conclusion that it is time
for the alliance to begin closing its open door.]{.underline}

#### Our assurances towards Taiwan are key to global security commitments

[The most-cited strategic argument for continuing **[US]{.mark}**
security [assistance to **Taiwan**]{.mark} is that the existing
**security architecture** in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond [serves
the interests of **many nations**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Within the
network of global security relationships, **[[Washington's behavior
toward Taiwan indicates its attitude toward security assistance
generally]{.mark}, [including its alliance commitments and willingness
to honor other obligations around the world]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As
retired admiral Eric McVadon said, "**[[American credibility as an
alliance partner and as a bulwark of peace and stability in the region
and around the world would be sorely diminished were we to

In outlining realist, economic, institutionalist, and
social-constructivist theoretical perspectives, other categories of
variables emerged: internal dimension of threats, bureaucracy and
alliance institutionalization, and shared values and identity. What
happens inside the Alliance could matter as much as [[what happens
**outside the Alliance**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given that NATO's
endurance had not conformed to the predictions of traditional alliance
theory, Ohio University professor Patricia Weitsman suggested examining
internal and external threat dyads in order to understand alliance
cohesion.21 She found that [NATO survived the end of the Cold War due to
low internal threat, which concerns the politics of alliances.
Consequently, this alliance cohesion theory says the lower the internal
threat, the more cohesive the alliance; and the greater the external
threat, the higher level of alliance cohesion.]{.underline}22 Another
important factor in alliance cohesion is the way in which intra-alliance
cooperation institutionalizes bureaucratic structures.23 For instance,
some assert that consultative norms and structures [[can
**mitigate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[internal threats to
cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}.24 Furthermore, [the Alliance's
institutional structures allow for information exchange among allies
that can raise the level of alliance cohesion independently from
external factors.25 Additionally, **[the transatlantic bond has depended
on credible signaling]{.mark} ([i.e.]{.mark}, [an ally's trust in
another's assurances]{.mark}).**]{.underline} Especially in the context
of nuclear sharing[, **"[weak signals]{.mark}" [of U.S.
commitment]{.mark} to Europe [could damage NATO's
cohesion]{.mark}**.]{.underline}26

Why would [Russia]{.underline} make a dash for Baltic capitals, as in
RAND's wargame, when the battle is decided by whether or not NATO can
successfully reinforce from Poland? Instead of fighting NATO forces in
the Baltics, the best way forward is to [turn]{.underline} that
**[deterrent]{.underline}** [into a **military hostage.**]{.underline}
**[[What if]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in the time it takes
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** to generate forces sufficient to break
through a Russian defensive position across Kaliningrad, the alliance
**[[collapses politically]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially given the
concern over losing its units behind enemy lines in the Baltics? All
analogies are imperfect, but it strikes me that advocates for a robust
U.S. military presence want to replay the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940,
where U.S. forces get to fill the unenviable shoes of the British
Expeditionary Force surrounded by the German Army. Whether you have one
brigade or three brigades, you're still going to lose that fight. U.S.
planners would not be the first to think you could hold a pocket against
a land power and reinforce it across a gap. The idea that a line of U.S.
forces along the Russian border can achieve deterrence by denial in
modern times boasts all the ingenuity of the Maginot Line. More
[forces]{.underline} in place [can't]{.underline} always [compensate
for]{.underline} a [poor strategy]{.underline} and unworkable geography.
A Million Ways to Die in the East [[**NATO's** biggest challenge is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} the balance of [[forces,
but]{.underline}]{.mark} the fact that **[[its
credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** is attached to every square meter of
Baltic terrain. [[A]{.underline}]{.mark} much more **[[likely
scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one
[in]{.underline} [which [**Russia**]{.mark} deploys a]{.underline} large
[land force]{.underline} on the borders as part of a snap exercise, as
it did opposite Ukraine in early 2014, [and]{.underline} then [seizes
some unknown patch of dirt]{.underline}. **[[Would NATO
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** this offending Russian force over a few
square meters? It's one thing to contemplate trading Washington for
Vilnius --- what about some farm house on the Russian-Estonian border?
Let's take another option wherein Russia simply picks up the border and
moves it further into the Baltic states. That's no fantasy. Moscow has
been doing this to Georgia in South Ossetia. On the one hand, NATO
cannot let the Russians break its credibility through salami-slicing
tactics, but on the other hand, the Baltic states themselves might not
be so eager to pick a fight they can't win over a few feet of real
estate. Who is willing to attack a Russian army on Russia's border?
Plenty has been written on what would happen if Russian special forces
tried to seize Baltic towns, leveraging the presumed camaraderie of the
local ethnic Russian population. This Crimea-like scenario is
improbable, especially because Russia had forces in place in Crimea from
the very beginning, but it offers an important lesson that should drive
NATO's thinking about the Baltic high-end fight. The challenge is not
NATO's deterrence against a hypothetical conventional war, which is not
only unlikely but wholly unnecessary for Russia to challenge NATO. The
problem lies in compellence, because there are numerous scenarios in
which Russia can set up a challenge to NATO's credibility as an alliance
and compel the West against a response, thereby leading to failure. The
reason Russia annexed Crimea without having to overcome resistance is in
large part due to conventional compellence. Russia's military deployment
and a directly issued threat compelled Ukraine's leaders to avoid even
attempting resistance. There was no combat in Crimea. Those arguing for
forward deployments keep envisioning a scenario where Russian troops or
special forces cross the border and shoot first. That is one set of
problems that militarily cannot be easily solved as described above, but
the more perilous cases are those in which NATO must shoot first when
faced with a large Russian conventional deployment. EUCOM's true
challenge is not deterrence --- it's how to handle compellence by an
advanced conventional adversary capable of combining special forces and
large-scale military operations. As I've written elsewhere on War on the
Rocks on the establishment's obsession with hybrid warfare, the problem
is also not a hybrid one. Russia has re-forged its military as a useful
instrument of national power and rediscovered how to compel others using
military power. Even if territorial defense was workable --- a dubious
prospect at best --- deterrence only works if the other side plans to
attack you. A smarter approach for Moscow, and one conceptually
demonstrated in Crimea, is to create a crisis in which NATO's
credibility is tested on the choice of whether or not to attack Russia
first. What's the Right Force Posture for Nuclear Oblivion? The other
problem with the fixation on conventional deterrence in the Baltic fight
is that just as in the old standoff between NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} battle [[is]{.underline} **[fraught with
opportunities for nuclear escalation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Most
Russian experts I know in the military analysis community, including
those in Russia, don't see much of a chance for conventional battle with
NATO to stay conventional. RAND didn't wargame that out, since theirs
was an AirLand Battle exercise, but it makes the debate over how many
brigades to stick into the Baltics somewhat moot. On any map, Russia's
exclave of Kaliningrad is a central problem in keeping this a
conventional fight, because this is a piece of Russian territory that
NATO must either bypass or neutralize to reinforce the Baltics. That's
not just a Russian fort, projecting long arcs of anti-access and area
denial weaponry between Poland and Lithuania --- it's also liable to be
a nuclear landmine. There is a possibility that [if Russian forces are
sufficiently degraded]{.underline} or defeated in Kaliningrad that
[[Moscow may resort to]{.underline}]{.mark} or threaten **[[nuclear
first use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even if we fill all those hex squares
with blue forces, it doesn't get around the issue that [[NATO's]{.mark}
prize]{.underline} for its victory [is]{.underline} not necessarily the
successful rescue of the Baltics, but [an]{.underline}
**[inbound]{.underline}** tactical [**nuclear warhead**. RAND's report
alludes to the minor problem of]{.underline} escalation (**[all of us
dying in nuclear oblivion]{.underline}**), [but such thoughts get in the
way of gaming out how many heavy armor brigades one needs in on the
eastern flank.]{.underline} Nuclear escalation is not assured, but given
the impact of such an outcome, perhaps [the [**best strategy**
is]{.mark} to make decisions that afford the most opportunities for
**[managing escalation dynamics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That means a
force posture oriented toward strategic flexibility, not entrenchment.

### 2NC Credibility DA -- Russia Impact 

#### Unchecked Russian aggression risks extinction

**Fisher 15** (Max, Foreign affairs columnist at VOX, \"How World War
III became possible,\" 6/29,
http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war)

That is why, analysts will tell you, [today\'s [**tensions**
bear]{.mark} far more [similarity to]{.mark}]{.underline} the period
before [**[World War I]{.mark}**: an unstable power balance,
belligerence over peripheral conflicts, entangling military commitments,
disputes over]{.underline} the future of [the European order, and
dangerous uncertainty]{.underline} about what actions will and will not
force the other party into conflict. [Today\'s
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, once more the strongest nation in
Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, [calls to mind the
turn-of-the-century German Empire]{.underline}, which Henry Kissinger
described as \"too big for Europe, but too small for the world.\" Now,
as then, [a rising power, propelled by nationalism, [is **seeking to
revise the European order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now, as then, it
believes that through superior cunning, and perhaps even by proving its
might, it can force a larger role for itself. Now, as then, the drift
toward war is gradual and easy to miss --- which is exactly what makes
it so dangerous. But [there is one way in which today\'s dangers are
less like those before World War I]{.underline}, and more similar to
those of the Cold War: **[the apocalyptic logic of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. [[Mutual suspicion]{.mark}, [fear]{.mark} of an
existential threat[, armies parked across]{.mark} [borders]{.mark} from
one another, [and hair-trigger]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark} all
**[make any small skirmish]{.mark} a potential
[armageddon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In some ways, that logic has grown
even more dangerous. [Russia]{.underline}, hoping to compensate for its
conventional military forces\' relative weakness, [has dramatically
relaxed its rules for using nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Whereas Soviet
leaders saw their nuclear weapons as pure deterrents, something that
existed precisely so they would never be used, Putin\'s view appears to
be radically different. [**[Russia\'s]{.mark}** official [nuclear
doctrine calls on the country to **launch a battlefield nuclear strike**
in]{.mark} case of [a **conventional war**]{.mark} that could pose an
existential threat]{.underline}. These are more than just words: Moscow
has repeatedly signaled its willingness and preparations to use nuclear
weapons even in a more limited war. [[This is a **terrifyingly low
bar**]{.mark} for nuclear weapons use]{.underline}, particularly given
that any war would likely occur along Russia\'s borders and thus not far
from Moscow. And it suggests Putin has adopted an idea that Cold War
leaders considered unthinkable: that a \"limited\" nuclear war, of small
warheads dropped on the battlefield, could be not only survivable but
winnable. \"It's not just a difference in rhetoric. It's a whole
different world,\" Bruce G. Blair, a nuclear weapons scholar at
Princeton, told the Wall Street Journal. He called Putin\'s decisions
more dangerous than those of any Soviet leader since 1962. \"There's a
low nuclear threshold now that didn't exist during the Cold War.\"
Nuclear theory is complex and disputable; maybe Putin is right. But many
theorists would say he is wrong, that the logic of nuclear warfare means
[a \"limited\" nuclear strike is in fact likely to trigger a larger
nuclear war]{.underline} --- **[a doomsday scenario]{.underline}** [in
which major American, Russian, and European cities would be
targets]{.underline} for attacks many times more powerful than the bombs
that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [[**Even if** a nuclear war
did]{.mark} somehow [remain **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
contained, recent [[studies suggest that]{.mark} environmental and
atmospheric [damage **would cause a \"decade of
winter**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" and mass crop die-outs that could kill
up to 1 billion people in a global famine.

Doomsday: Why **[a [War with Russia Would Go Nuclear]{.mark} (And Kill
Billions]{.underline}** of People) While [a recent RAND]{.underline}
Corporation [study concluded that **[Russia could overrun NATO's member
states]{.mark}**]{.underline} Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania **[[in the
Baltics within sixty hours]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the war games did not
simulate the use of nuclear weapons. [If]{.underline}, however, [a war
were to breakout between NATO and Russia]{.underline}, **[nuclear
weapons would certainly come into play]{.underline}**---[**especially**
if the conflict were **going poorly for Moscow**]{.underline}. **[Unlike
the Soviet Union, which had a]{.underline}** stated "**[no first use"
policy, [modern Russia explicitly rejected that
pledge]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}in 1993. [In fact, as Moscow's
conventional forces continued to atrophy]{.underline} during the
economic and social meltdown of the 1990s, [Russia developed a doctrine
called **de-escalation**]{.underline} in 2000 . Simply put, [[if]{.mark}
Russia were [faced with a large-scale attack t]{.mark}hat could defeat
its conventional forces, [Moscow might **resort to nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2010, Russia revised the doctrine
somewhat as its conventional forces started to recover from the
aftermath of the Soviet collapse---the current version states Moscow
would use nuclear weapons in situations "that would put in danger the
very existence of the state." [While]{.underline} the RAND study shows
that [Russia would]{.underline} be able to [take the
Baltics]{.underline} fairly [easily, the war game didn't explore what
would happen in the event of a **NATO counter offensive**]{.underline}.
The RAND study simply states: [[Such a rapid defeat would leave
NATO]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[limited]{.underline}]{.mark} number of [[options]{.mark}, all bad: a
**bloody counteroffensive**]{.underline}, **[fraught with escalatory
risk]{.underline}**, [to liberate the Baltics]{.underline}; [to
**[escalate]{.mark} itself**, as it threatened to do]{.underline} to
avert defeat during the Cold War; [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} to
**[[concede]{.underline}]{.mark}** at least temporary
**[defeat]{.underline}**, [with]{.underline} uncertain but predictably
**[disastrous consequences]{.underline}** [for the Alliance]{.underline}
and, not incidentally, the people of the Baltics. [A NATO
counter-offensive would be]{.underline} bloody and fraught with
escalatory risk---but it's one of the **[probable]{.underline}**
outcomes of a Russian invasion. [In that eventuality, Russian
conventional forces---of which only a portion are well trained
and]{.underline} well [equipped---would likely be]{.underline} severely
damaged or even **[destroyed]{.underline}**. Moreover, if NATO forces
hit targets inside Russia or crossed over into Russian territory, Moscow
might conclude that there is a danger to the existence of the state.
After all, Moscow has expressed concerns in the past that regime change
by the West is an all too real danger. [In that situation, [Russia might
**counter**]{.mark}]{.underline} advancing NATO forces
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} its arsenal of **[[tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Russian tactical nuclear arsenal is
not nearly as large as the Soviet arsenal had once been, but concrete
numbers are hard to come by. The Soviet Union was thought to have
possessed between 15,000 and 25,000 tactical nuclear weapons of all
types ranging from suitcase-sized containers and nuclear mines to
short-range aircraft delivered missiles, nuclear gravity bombs and
artillery shells---as well as short-, medium- and intermediate-range
ballistic missile warheads. While Moscow has been slowly eliminating its
non-strategic arsenal since the end of the Cold War, Russia many still
have as many as 4,000 tactical nuclear weapons , according to the
Congressional Research Service. However, other analyses suggest that
Russia has as few as 2,000 operational tactical nuclear weapons.
[A]{.underline} more **[recent analysis]{.underline}** by Royal United
Service Institute's Igor Sutyagin [suggests that Russia has]{.underline}
a maximum of **[1,040 non-strategic nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Of
those about 128-210 warheads are assigned to the Russian ground forces.
The Russian navy has about 330 tactical nuclear weapons, while the
Russian air force has 334 non-strategic weapons. Meanwhile, Russian air
defense forces have a further sixty-eight to 166 tactical nuclear
weapons mounted on various surface-to-air missiles.

[This year commemorates the 40th anniversary of the TRA, on which
**America's unique and secure relationship with Taiwan has been
grounded.**]{.underline} The preamble of the TRA stipulates that [the
act is]{.underline} [to help **maintain peace, security,** and
**stability** in the Western Pacific and]{.underline} to [promote the
foreign policy of the United States by authorizing the continuation of
commercial, cultural, and other **relations between** the people of
**the U**nited **S**tates **and** the people on **Taiwan,**]{.underline}
and for other purposes.1 The TRA is exceptional in purpose and form. It
is the only law to govern nearly every aspect of U.S. relations with a
foreign government in the absence of formal diplomatic relations. It
sets forth clear policy goals and establishes an institutional framework
to meet those objectives. [The fact that the TRA has been in force
without amendment over the past 40 years is remarkable.]{.underline}
Signed into law on April 10, 1979, [the TRA came into existence out of
the need for the United States to find a way to protect its significant
security and commercial interests]{.underline} in Taiwan in the wake of
President Jimmy Carter's termination of diplomatic relations with Taiwan
[as well as a mutual defense treaty dating from the 1949 Communist
takeover of mainland China.]{.underline} Members of the House of
Representatives and Senate from both parties worked together to craft a
bill, passing the TRA with a near unanimous vote to set the framework
and course for America's ongoing engagement with Taiwan. Over the
ensuing decades, subsequent [Congresses,]{.underline} whether controlled
by Democrats or Republicans, [repeatedly have sought to bolster the TRA
by expressing strong moral and political support for Taiwan]{.underline}
and urging successive Administrations to back up America's commitment to
Taiwan with tangible support. Providing policy continuity, **[the TRA
has survived the test of time in the face of constant and growing
criticism from Beijing]{.underline}**. Not surprisingly, [Taiwan's
support]{.underline} in Washington has been strong and [is getting
stronger]{.underline}. Over the past year, [Congress has reinforced the
TRA by enacting two new laws: the Taiwan Travel Act that encourages
official visits between Washington and Taipei "at all levels of
government," and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act that reiterates
American support for Taiwan's key role in its Indo--Pacific strategy.
The TRA has played an indispensable role in shaping American policy
toward Taiwan and U.S. strategy in Asia. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has]{.underline} clearly [recognized]{.underline}
that supporting a Taiwan that is free to make its own decisions, and
free from coercion by the People's Republic of China, [is in America's
vital national security interest]{.underline}. As specified in the
preamble of the legislation, [**the TRA,** in fact, **is** explicit
about **the connection between Taiwan and the maintenance of "peace,
security and stability in the Western Pacific."** In a testament to that
unambiguous geopolitical and economic link, Taiwan and the United States
have become strong allies sharing powerful commitments to the values of
democracy, the rule of law, and free markets. The relationship today is
a fruitful partnership that delivers measurable and **concrete benefits
for Americans and Taiwanese alike.**]{.underline} In his June 2018

Taiwan office complex, board Chairman James Moriarty summed up
succinctly: "As Taiwan has transformed itself into a vibrant democracy
and a model for the Indo--Pacific region and beyond, [our relationship
has grown into a close partnership based on the unshakable foundation of
shared values and interests."]{.underline}[2 As a country with an
impressive record as a constructive member of the world community,
**despite efforts by mainland China to isolate and marginalize it,
Taiwan is providing a positive example for others of a pathway to
development and prosperity based on high degrees of both political and
economic freedom.**]{.underline} In its latest edition of Freedom in the
World, an annual report that assesses political rights and civil
liberties around the globe, Freedom House classifies Taiwan as a "free"
nation.3 On the economic front, The Heritage Foundation's 25th4 edition
of the Index of Economic Freedom now ranks Taiwan as the 10th-freest
economy in the world.5

#### Abandoning Taiwan decimates American assurances and causes regional proliferation

**Rehman 14** (Iskander; fellow at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) in Washington, DC; 2/28/14, "Why Taiwan
Matters,"
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-taiwan-matters-9971?page=4)

**[Abandoning Taiwan would erode American credibility]{.underline}** in
the Indo-Pacific **[and add fuel to an ongoing regional arms
race.]{.underline}** Taiwan policy cannot be compartmentalized, and
viewed in isolation from the pivot and U.S. policy towards Asia.
[**Decision-makers in Seoul, Tokyo, and Manila would naturally question
U.S. resolve and Washington's commitment to their security in the event
of an abandonment of Taiwan. Japan**,]{.underline} in particular,
**[would feel threatened by the stationing of Chinese forces on
Taiwan]{.underline}**---in essence losing a valuable geopolitical
buffer---in such close proximity to its southwestern approaches.
[**Heightened threat perceptions in Tokyo**,]{.underline} if combined
with a lack of faith in the credibility of U.S. conventional and nuclear
deterrence, **[could lead Japan to acquire a nuclear-weapons capability.
The corrosive effect of forfeiting Taiwan would also extend to other key
allies such as South Korea, which might question Washington's
determination to defend it from North Korean aggression.]{.underline}**
Indeed, recent public-opinion polls have indicated that **[a growing
proportion of the South Korean public now favors the development of a
South Korean nuclear arsenal]{.underline}**. Revealingly, the reasons
invoked for such a shift were growing concerns over North Korea's
increasingly unpredictable and belligerent behavior, as well as over the
continued viability of the United States' security guarantee. Meanwhile,
smaller **[regional states might find themselves both disinclined to
place their faith in the United States]{.underline}**, and cowed into
submission by a more self-assured and advantageously positioned China.
An **[abandonment of Taiwan could thus lead to]{.underline}** a creeping
Finlandization---or **[rapid nuclearization---of large tracts of the
Indo-Pacific, and, in time, to the sunset of American primacy in
Asia.]{.underline}** Taiwan, therefore, most certainly matters.

#### East Asian prolif causes nuclear war

**Kleiner 16** - Postdoctral fellow at Yale Law School (Sam, \"With His
Finger on the Trigger\", The Atlantic, 6/3/16,

A new nuclear-arms race, moreover, could be even riskier than the one
Reagan and others worked so hard to end. In retrospect, the Cold War
standoff between two massive, nuclear-armed superpowers offered some
stability; among other things, the fact that the United States and the
Soviet Union could destroy each other, or any other challenger, in a
nuclear confrontation ended up preventing either side from using nuclear
weapons. Global alliances were structured in a bipolar system, with
smaller powers picking one side or the other, which meant fewer possible
avenues for conflict. But that world came to an end when the Cold War
finished. **[We now live in a multipolar world that is, in many ways, a
more dangerous one]{.underline}**. Former Secretaries of State Kissinger
and George Shultz, former Secretary of Defense William Perry, and
Senator Sam Nunn warned in 2011 that "**[the growing number of nations
with nuclear arms and differing motives, aims and ambitions poses very
high and unpredictable risks and increased instability." One
particularly risky and region right now is East Asia, where competing
territorial claims and an unpredictable North Korea threaten to flare
into conflict. If Japan, which is revising its pacifist post-World War
II foreign policy toward a more assertive one, or South Korea, where
there is broad popular support for weaponization, go nuclear, the
chances grow for a regional arms race---and for nuclear
war.]{.underline}** Trump has begun to style himself as a foreign-policy
realist. But he's not a realist---he's a radical. One possibility, as
Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies
noted: "**[North Korea might be tempted to launch a preemptive attack at
a time when the U.S. defense commitment \[to South Korea\] might no
longer apply]{.underline}**." But even "short of this worst-case
scenario, rather than negotiate disarmament, **[North Korea more likely
would claim the South's actions as a justification for stepping up its
own nuclear program]{.underline}**." These are by no means the only
risks. There is, for example, **[the risk of an accidental firing or a
rogue officer deciding that he or she wants to launch a nuclear weapon.
There is the risk of "loose nukes" falling into the wrong hands, and the
risk that individual scientists will be willing to transfer nuclear
technology to the highest bidder, as Pakistan's A.Q. Khan did in selling
nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea.]{.underline}** When
the nuclear bomb was first being developed, Secretary of War Henry
Stimson offered a poignant warning about how devastating the weapon
would be. He told President Henry Truman that "such a weapon may be
constructed in secret and used suddenly and effectively with devastating
power by a willful nation or group against an unsuspecting nation or
group of much greater size and material power." **[Today, America's
"greater size and material power" can't necessarily stop a nuclear
strike, particularly if the materials fall into the hands of
terrorists.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Taiwan Prolif DA -- UQ 

#### Trump's view of China as a competitor incentivize his uniquely strong support for Taiwan

**Chung 18** (Lawrence Chung previously wrote for Reuters and AFP for
over 12 years, he specializes in research on US-Taiwan relations and
currently writes for South China Morning Post. "US, Taiwan military ties
closer than ever as Donald Trump challenges Beijing", October 29, 2018.
<https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2170449/us-taiwan-military-ties-closer-ever-donald-trump-challenges>)

[Since **Trump** took office in January 2017, both his administration
and Congress have **shifted from a policy of not enraging Beijing when
it comes to Taipei, to a new policy of challenging the mainland
government and focusing more on Taiwan's defences.**]{.underline} But
analysts say the government of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen needs to
evaluate the significance and impact of that new direction, given the
hypersensitive relations between the US, mainland China and Taiwan.
Earlier this month, [US Assistant Secretary of Defence for Asian and
Pacific Security Affairs Randall Schriver confirmed that Washington was
moving towards a "more normal foreign military sales relationship" with
Taiwan.]{.underline} That was a reference to Trump's approval in
September of a US\$330 million deal to provide spare parts and other
logistics for several types of the island's military aircraft -- a deal
that came less than a year after the Pentagon agreed to sell US\$1.4
billion of missiles, torpedoes and an early warning system to Taiwan.
The US-Taiwan Business Council, which is based in the Washington area
and has organised [the annual US-Taiwan Defence Industry
Conference]{.underline} since 2002, [said approval of the deal was
encouraging because it "appears to move away from the previous bundling
method of Taiwan arms sales".]{.underline} It called on Washington to
swiftly handle any new arms sale requests from Taiwan through
inter-agency assessment that does not take into account Beijing's
potential reaction to a proposed deal. [Beijing -- which considers
Taiwan a wayward province to be reunified, by force if necessary -- has
been the main reason the US has taken a cautious approach to any arms
deals or high-level exchanges with Taipei since Washington switched
diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979 and committed to
observing the one-China policy.]{.underline} Beijing has repeatedly
warned Washington against seeking closer military ties with Taipei, and
has protested against every arms deal they have made -- including the
most recent one -- and any US-Taiwan exchange that was seen to have
violated the one-China principle. Taiwanese officials and analysts say
the latest deal indicates that [**Trump is more willing** to give the
island a faster response **to its arms sale requests to help Taipei
build up its defences in the face of growing military threats from
mainland China.**]{.underline} "We greatly appreciate that the US is
willing to review our military sales requests on a case-by-case basis,
instead of the bundling approach carried out previously," Deputy Defence
Minister Shen Yi-ming said in a parliamentary meeting earlier this
month. Beijing has suspended exchanges with Taipei and staged a series
of war games around Taiwan to intimidate the island since Tsai, of the
independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, became president in
2016 and refused to accept its one-China policy. Beijing has also tried
to isolate Taiwan internationally by poaching five of its diplomatic
allies since Tsai took office. "[This has resulted in the Tsai
administration seeking greater support from Washington. And **with Trump
seeing China as a strategic competitor instead of a partner,**
developing **closer ties** and helping to boost Taiwan's defences **have
become part of his national security strategy in dealing with
Beijing**,"]{.underline} said Wang Kung-yi, a professor of political
science at Chinese Culture University in Taipei. [Since Trump signed
into law the Taiwan Travel Act in March to allow top-level officials to
visit the island, US-Taiwan military ties have become even closer, Wang
said.]{.underline} Hundreds of US arms dealers and former US military
officials travelled to Taiwan for the first-ever defence industry forum
jointly held by the US-Taiwan Business Council and Taiwan Defence
Industry Development Association in the southern city of Kaohsiung in
May. That came a month after Trump agreed to issue the marketing licence
required for US manufacturers to sell Taiwan the technology it needs to
build eight submarines. That project had been stalled since
then-president George W Bush approved the sale in 2001. Since July, at
least four US warships have risked further escalating tensions by
passing through the Taiwan Strait in freedom of navigation operations to
challenge Beijing over its military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region
-- particularly the disputed South China Sea. On two occasions, when the
US Navy vessels were still in transit, Taiwan's military issued a
statement -- on July 7 and again on October 22 -- about the destroyers'
movements in the Taiwan Strait. [Analysts said Taiwan did not usually
release information on such operations to avoid angering Beijing, but
that has changed under Trump's strategy of confrontation with China as
tensions mount over trade, security and strategic issues.]{.underline}
Calling the transit a "smart move", Ian Easton, a research fellow with
the US-based think tank Project 2049 Institute, said it appeared
[**Washington and Taipei** had **decided to publicise** the ships'
passage **to send a clear message to Beijing** that the Taiwan Strait
was international waters, **and that the US and Taiwan would cooperate
and not hide their activities** there]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Taiwan Prolif DA -- Link 

#### Taiwan will proliferate if US ends arms sales -- history proves 

**Blumenthal 11** (Daniel Blumenthal, director of Asian studies at the
American Enterprise Institute, " Rethinking US Foreign policy Towards
Taiwan",
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/03/02/rethinking-u-s-foreign-policy-towards-taiwan/>)

To Glaser, Taiwan is different. China's belief that Taiwan is part of it
is non-negotiable, and Beijing and Washington have very different views
of what constitutes the status quo across the Strait. **[The Taiwan
dispute has no diplomatic solution and the risks of nuclear war are
getting too high, particularly with China's advancing second strike
capability]{.underline}**. His answer is for the United States to make
the necessary \"adjustments\" and abandon Taiwan. He acknowledges
potential critics who may say appeasement usually whets the appetite of
the appeased. But, says Glaser, not all adversaries are Hitler, and
China has limited territorial goals. Even if China has more expansive
territorial claims, the United States can remediate any military
imbalance through a greater conventional presence. In the end, the real
danger is a self-fulfilling prophesy, a failure by the United States to
realize that its basic goals are compatible with China's. Glaser fears
that this is already happening --- the United States is taking a much
more competitive military stance because its ability to operate along
China's periphery is in danger. According to Glaser, this dilemma has
two solutions. The first is for Washington to realize **[that U.S.
interests are changing --- Taiwan is not really vital.]{.underline}**
And second, the United States should forego the kind of nuclear
superiority that could counter China's second strike capability. Problem
solved. This is a fairly conventional international theory argument
about the relative stability of Sino-American relations. Glaser is
essentially taking a side in an [old
debate](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/is3002_pp007-045_friedberg.pdf).
His innovation is the abandonment of Taiwan, a necessary step to
decrease the security dilemma and reveal China's truly limited aims.
Glaser's argument is both timely and testable: unlike most social
science experiments, it has been conducted in the real world. The Obama
administration came to power in step with this theory. First, the
administration initially viewed the biggest obstacle to Sino-U.S.
stability as Washington's misreading of Chinese intentions which they
thought were actually quite limited. The greatest risk to peace, they
argued, was that the United States would overreact to China's rise. The
Obama administration called its new policy \"strategic reassurance\": we
would reassure China that we would not contain it. Second, the United
States has basically abandoned its commitment to Taiwan under the
[Taiwan Relations Act](http://www.taiwandocuments.org/tra01.htm). The
only action the Obama administration has taken consistent with the TRA
was the sale of half an arms package left over from the Bush years.
There has been no serious effort on the part of the Obama administration
to enhance Taiwan's security. The Obama administration has arguably
taken the most minimalist interpretation of the TRA since the law's
passage. The third policy change occurred in Taiwan. Taipei has followed
a policy of reconciliation and removed any conceivable \"threat\" of
\"independence\" (always a red herring; according to Taiwan's democratic
procedures it is practically impossible to vote for independence). And
how has China reacted to all of these concessions, including the de
facto abandonment of Taiwan? By pressing other territorial claims,
intimidating allies elsewhere, and rejecting calls for better military
relations with the United States. In short, Washington took all the
steps that Glaser called for and Sino-U.S. relations have rarely been
worse. Eventually, the administration had to resist China's aggressive
moves. And its very modest attempt to push back against China's
extravagant claims in the South and East China Seas were met with
histrionics in Beijing. China aggressively pressed Vietnam to give up
its claims to the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea and

China broke off diplomatic relations with Japan and stopped shipments of
a strategic commodity
[when](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/23/world/la-fg-china-japan-spat-20100923)
Japan arrested a drunken trawler captain who had rammed a ship in
Japanese waters. China's refusal to acknowledge North Korea's
responsibility for the slaughter of South Korean soldiers and civilians
and its hyperventilating about U.S.-South Korean exercises in Korean
waters has made Japan and South Korea suspicious about China's
intentions on the Korean peninsula. Australia, no ally of Taiwan, has
announced a massive military build-up because of its fears of Chinese
movements deeper into the Pacific. And on it goes. Indeed, while
China-Taiwan relations are at a high point and U.S.-Taiwan relations
virtually non-existent; the rest of Asia is [arming
itself](http://www.nbr.org/publications/strategic_asia/pdf/Preview/SA10/SA10_Military_preview.pdf)to
the teeth to guard against the dual danger of China's rise and a
weakening of the U.S. commitment to Asia. Perhaps the absence of U.S.
support for Taiwan is being interpreted in Asian capitals as
Washington's general ambivalence about its security commitments? Indeed,
in providing an answer to Secretary Rumsfeld's infamous public query
about why the Chinese are engaged in a military build-up, Glaser
undermines a pillar of his own argument that China's goals are limited.
He says that China is merely responding to U.S. regional military
activities. Exactly right. But the activity that Glaser describes
includes strategic tasks that the United States has undertaken since the
end of the Second World War. Perhaps China is building up its military
because it does not like U.S. presence in Asia, no matter how limited.
The difference now is it has the power to do something about it. China
is certainly not reacting to a U.S. military build-up. To the contrary,
the very capabilities the United States most needs in the Pacific have
been steadily eroding over the past decade. Yet despite stability in the
strait and a relative decline of U.S. military power in the Pacific,
Chinese military advances continue apace. Glaser never asks the central
question --- how do China and the United States come to their respective
views of security? My own view is that the sources of national security
policy are both deeply embedded in a nation's traditions and are
constantly changing. (Who would have imagined that we would be fighting
for ten years in Afghanistan? If North Korea collapses tomorrow, we may
be looking for nukes with a heavy ground presence for some time). Only
three years ago we were certain that China's \"core interests\" were
limited to Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. Now the Chinese have informed us
that their core interests include the entire South China Sea. For its
part, **[the United States has always taken]{.underline}** **[an
expansive view of its security in Asia]{.underline}**; an impulse that
intensified after Pearl Harbor. It would never slog through the Pacific
again, it would defend forward, and **[it would rely on a set of
allies]{.underline}** to do so. It would press those allies to become
democratic capitalists (realists never explain why the United States
always thinks it does better in a world populated by other democracies)
and forego their nuclear weapons. It all happened. **[We have enjoyed
peace in Asia for over three decades. Our policy has
worked]{.underline}**, why should we adjust it? Then there is the role
of Taiwan in our foreign policy. It has been a significant part of
Asia's democratic peace, as well as a critical part of Asia's ---
including China's --- economic boom and the region's political
transitions. Every time we try and abandon it --- in the 50s, in the
70s, in the 90s --- we find it too important to be left to China's
tender mercies. Theorists like Glaser offer no explanation for why we
have not abandoned Taiwan given all the opportunities we have had to do
so. Let me offer a few. **[Any change]{.underline}** to Taiwan's de
facto independent status **[would be highly
destabilizing]{.underline}**. First, almost no Taiwanese want to live
under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. **[Many Taiwanese would
leave the island]{.underline}**, meaning that Asia would lose a critical
part of its economic engine. [**Those who would not leave would likely
start to build nuclear weapons and their delivery systems --- a process
that began,** and which we stopped**, the last time we tried to abandon
Taiwan.**]{.underline}

How close did Taiwan come to developing a nuclear weapons capability?
Recent scholarship has painted a [much clearer

of **[Taiwan's interest in developing]{.underline}** such a
[\[**nuclear\] capability**]{.underline}, as well as [U.S. efforts to
prevent Taiwan from reaching that point]{.underline}. A [recent
monograph
by](http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/TaiwansFormerNuclearWeaponsProgram_POD_color_withCover.pdf)
David Albright and Andrea Stricker helps illuminate some aspects of
Taiwan's program, as well as the U.S. reaction. In association with
this, the National Security Archive has [collected a trove of
unclassified
documents](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2019-01-10/taiwans-bomb)
from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, detailing the U.S. response to
Taiwan's program. **[Taiwan's interest in nuclear weapons stemmed from
an acute sense of vulnerability]{.underline}**. Although the United
States held an overwhelming military advantage over China, that military
advantage would not hold forever, and it left Taiwan at the mercy of
Washington's generosity. When the PRC tested a nuclear weapon in 1964,
it became apparent to Taipei that a deterrent relationship of the sort
that held in Europe might make the U.S. think twice about coming to
Taiwan's aid in war. This logic was not lost on the United States, which
began to worry about the program in the mid-1960s. Taiwan attempted and
failed to acquire a nuclear reactor from West Germany, later
successfully purchasing a Canadian reactor. Later, Taiwan pursued
reprocessing capabilities, to the alarm of the U.S. State Department.
Along the way, Taiwan undertook some clandestine activities, including
hiding equipment designed to produce heavy water. Taiwan took active
steps to deny that it was working on a nuclear program, likely
understanding that the United States would react poorly. The United
States was not faintly unclear about this point, but it did not
challenge Taiwan's program in multilateral fora. Taipei sought the
ability to produce device without having any specific intent to produce
device. This meant that Taiwan would have the requisite materials,
engineering know-how, and physical plant necessary to build a device
within the time frame of a few months, presumably too short for either
Beijing or Washington to stop the effort. The situation came to a head
in January 1988, when the United States exfiltrated a Taiwanese
scientist who had been providing intelligence on the nuclear program.
U.S. officials believed that Chang Hsien-yi had provided sufficiently
specific information that it would be possible for Taiwanese
intelligence to identify him, which would have led to a prosecution that
would have embarrassed both sides. Word of Taiwan's program broke into
the media, including attention from The New York Times. Under pressure,
Taiwan turned over its heavy water and some other equipment that it
could use to support a nuclear program. By late 1988 the United States
no longer had significant concerns about Taiwan's nuclear program. Long
story short, Taiwan was keeping its options open, and keeping its
options open meant keeping the United States at arms length with respect
to nuclear capabilities. But the United States handled the situation
delicately. The State Department wished to avoid a situation in which
Taiwan would be publicly embarrassed, or would have to privately come
clean to U.S. officials. The [U.S. successfully prevented what might
have become a major breach of the international non-proliferation
regime.]{.underline} Of course, [some could argue that Taiwan should
have gone nuclear then; **some would argue that Taiwan** still **should
go nuclear now**. That **would have been very bad for the international
non-proliferation regime**]{.underline}, but may have reduced the
overall chance of war with the PRC, and ensured Taiwan's independence.

Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread **[nuclear

Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the
mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its
coercive diplomacy.19 A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific
would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to
the existing nuclear deterrents of India and Pakistan, and to the
emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. **[An arc of nuclear

#### Abandoning East Asian assurances causes instability and goes nuclear

**Goh 8** - Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of
Politics and International Relations at the Univ of Oxford(Evelyn,
International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, "Hierarchy and the role of
the United States in the East Asian security order," 2008 8(3):353-377,
Oxford)

The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference
means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally
related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and
order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of
material calculations -- smaller states\' assurance that the expected
costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the
benefits -- and ideational convictions -- the sense of legitimacy,
derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate
state\'s authority in the social order. The empirical analysis in the
next section shows that **[regional stability in East Asia in the
post-Second World War years can be correlated to the degree of
collective certainty about the US-led regional hierarchy. East Asian
stability and instability has been determined by U.S. assurances,
self-confidence, and commitment to maintaining its primary position in
the regional hierarchy; the perceptions and confidence of regional
states about US commitment; and the reactions of subordinate states in
the region to the varied challengers to the regional hierarchical
order.]{.underline}** 4. Hierarchy and the East Asian security order
Currently, the regional hierarchy in East Asia is still dominated by the
United States. Since the 1970s, China has increasingly claimed the
position of second-ranked great power, a claim that is today legitimized
by the hierarchical deference shown by smaller subordinate powers such
as South Korea and Southeast Asia. Japan and South Korea can, by virtue
of their alliance with the United States, be seen to occupy positions in
a third layer of regional major powers, while India is ranked next on
the strength of its new strategic relationship with Washington. North
Korea sits outside the hierarchic order but affects it due to its
military prowess and nuclear weapons capability. Apart from making
greater sense of recent history, conceiving of the US\' role in East
Asia as the dominant state in the regional hierarchy helps to clarify
three critical puzzles in the contemporary international and East Asian
security landscape. First, it contributes to explaining the lack of
sustained challenges to American global preponderance after the end of
the Cold War. **[Three of the key potential global challengers to US
unipolarity originate in Asia (China, India, and Japan), and their
support for or acquiescence to, US dominance have helped to stabilize
its global leadership. Through its dominance of the Asian regional
hierarchy, the United States has been able to neutralize the potential
threats to its position from Japan via an alliance,]{.underline}** from
India by gradually identifying and pursuing mutual commercial and
strategic interests, [**and from China by encircling and deterring it
with allied and friendly states that support American preponderance.
Secondly, recognizing US hierarchical preponderance further explains
contemporary under-balancing in Asia, both against a rising China, and
against incumbent American power**.]{.underline} I have argued that one
defining characteristic of a hierarchical system is voluntary
subordination of lesser states to the dominant state, and that this goes
beyond rationalistic bandwagoning because it is manifested in a social
contract that comprises the related processes of hierarchical assurance
and hierarchical deference. Critically, **[successful and sustainable
hierarchical assurance and deference helps to explain why Japan is not
yet a 'normal' country.]{.underline}** Japan has experienced significant
impetus to revise and expand the remit of its security forces in the
last 15 years. Yet, these pressures continue to be insufficient to
prompt a wholesale revision of its constitution and its
remilitarization. The reason is that **[the United States extends its
security umbrella over Japan through their alliance, which has led Tokyo
not only to perceive no threat from US dominance, but has in fact helped
to forge a security community between them (]{.underline}**Nau, 2003).
Adjustments in burden sharing in this alliance since the 1990s have
arisen not from greater independent Japanese strategic activism, but
rather from periods of strategic uncertainty and crises for Japan when
it appeared that American hierarchical assurance, along with US\'
position at the top of the regional hierarchy, was in question. Thus,
the Japanese priority in taking on more responsibility for regional
security has been to improve its ability to facilitate the US\' central
position, rather than to challenge it.13 In the face of the security
threats from North Korea and China, Tokyo\'s continued reliance on the
security pact with the United States is rational. While there remains
debate about Japan\'s re-militarization and the growing clout of
nationalist 'hawks' in Tokyo, for regional and domestic political
reasons, a sustained 'normalization' process cannot take place outside
of the restraining framework of the United States--Japan alliance
(Samuels, 2007; Pyle, 2007). [**Abandoning the alliance will entail
Japan making a conscience choice not only to remove itself from the
US-led hierarchy, but also to challenge the United States dominance
directly**.]{.underline} The United States--ROK alliance may be
understood in a similar way, although South Korea faces different sets
of constraints because of its strategic priorities related to North
Korea. As J.J. Suh argues, in spite of diminishing North Korean
capabilities, which render the US security umbrella less critical, the
alliance endures because of mutual identification -- in South Korea, the
image of the US as 'the only conceivable protector against aggression
from the North,' and in the United States, an image of itself as
protector of an allied nation now vulnerable to an 'evil' state
suspected of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist
networks (Suh, 2004). Kang, in contrast, emphasizes how South Korea has
become less enthusiastic about its ties with the United States -- as
indicated by domestic protests and the rejection of TMD -- and points
out that Seoul is not arming against a potential land invasion from
China but rather maritime threats (Kang, 2003, pp.79--80). These
observations are valid, but they can be explained by hierarchical
deference toward the United States, rather than China. The ROK\'s
military orientation reflects its identification with and dependence on
the United States and its adoption of US\' strategic aims. In spite of
its primary concern with the North Korean threat, Seoul\'s formal
strategic orientation is toward maritime threats, in line with
Washington\'s regional strategy. Furthermore, recent South Korean
Defense White Papers habitually cited a remilitarized Japan as a key
threat. The best means of coping with such a threat would be continued
reliance on the US security umbrella and on Washington\'s ability to
restrain Japanese remilitarization (Eberstadt et al., 2007). Thus, while
the United States--ROK bilateral relationship is not always easy, its
durability is based on South Korea\'s fundamental acceptance of the
United States as the region\'s primary state and reliance on it to
defend and keep regional order. It also does not rule out Seoul and
other US allies conducting business and engaging diplomatically with
China. India has increasingly adopted a similar strategy vis-à-vis China
in recent years. Given its history of territorial and political disputes
with China and its contemporary economic resurgence, India is seen as
the key potential power balancer to a growing China. Yet, India has
sought to negotiate settlements about border disputes with China, and
has moved significantly toward developing closer strategic relations
with the United States. Apart from invigorated defense cooperation in
the form of military exchange programs and joint exercises, the key
breakthrough was the agreement signed in July 2005 which facilitates
renewed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation (Mohan, 2007). Once
again, this is a key regional power that could have balanced more
directly and independently against China, but has rather chosen to align
itself or bandwagon with the primary power, the United States, partly
because of significant bilateral gains, but fundamentally in order to
support the latter\'s regional order-managing function. Recognizing a
regional hierarchy and seeing that the lower layers of this hierarchy
have become more active since the mid-1970s also allows us to understand
why there has been no outright balancing of China by regional states
since the 1990s. On the one hand, the US position at the top of the
hierarchy has been revived since the mid-1990s, meaning that deterrence
against potential Chinese aggression is reliable and in place.14 On the
other hand, the aim of regional states is to try to consolidate China\'s
inclusion in the regional hierarchy at the level below that of the
United States, not to keep it down or to exclude it. East Asian states
recognize that they cannot, without great cost to themselves, contain
Chinese growth. But they hope to socialize China by enmeshing it in
peaceful regional norms and economic and security institutions. They
also know that they can also help to ensure that the capabilities gap
between China and the United States remains wide enough to deter a power
transition. Because this strategy requires persuading China about the
appropriateness of its position in the hierarchy and of the legitimacy
of the US position, all East Asian states engage significantly with
China, with the small Southeast Asian states refusing openly to 'choose
sides' between the United States and China. Yet, hierarchical deference
continues to explain why regional institutions such as the ASEAN
Regional Forum, ASEAN + 3, and East Asian Summit have made limited
progress. While the United State has made room for regional multilateral
institutions after the end of the Cold War, its hierarchical
preponderance also constitutes the regional order to the extent that it
cannot comfortably be excluded from any substantive strategic
developments. On the part of some lesser states (particularly Japan and
Singapore), hierarchical deference is manifested in inclusionary
impulses (or at least impulses not to exclude the United States or US
proxies) in regional institutions, such as the East Asia Summit in
December 2005. Disagreement on this issue with others, including China
and Malaysia, has stymied potential progress in these regional
institutions (Malik, 2006). Finally, conceiving of a US-led East Asian
hierarchy amplifies our understanding of how and why the United
States--China relationship is now the key to regional order. The vital
nature of the Sino-American relationship stems from these two states\'
structural positions. As discussed earlier, China is the primary
second-tier power in the regional hierarchy. However, as Chinese power
grows and Chinese activism spreads beyond Asia, the United States is
less and less able to see China as merely a regional power -- witness
the growing concerns about Chinese investment and aid in certain African
countries. This causes a disjuncture between US global interests and US
regional interests. Regional attempts to engage and socialize China are
aimed at mediating its intentions. This process, however, cannot stem
Chinese growth, which forms the material basis of US threat perceptions.
Apprehensions about the growth of China\'s power culminates in US fears
about the region being 'lost' to China, echoing Cold War concerns that
transcribed regional defeats into systemic setbacks.15 On the other
hand, the US security strategy post-Cold War and post-9/11 have regional
manifestations that disadvantage China. The strengthening of US
alliances with Japan and Australia; and the deployment of US troops to
Central, South, and Southeast Asia all cause China to fear a
consolidation of US global hegemony that will first threaten Chinese
national security in the regional context and then stymie China\'s
global reach. Thus, the key determinants of the East Asian security
order relate to two core questions: (i) Can the US be persuaded that
China can act as a reliable 'regional stakeholder' that will help to
buttress regional stability and US global security aims;16 and (ii) can
China be convinced that the United States has neither territorial
ambitions in Asia nor the desire to encircle China, but will help to
promote Chinese development and stability as part of its global security
strategy? (Wang, 2005). But, these questions cannot be asked in the
abstract, outside the context of negotiation about their relative
positions in the regional and global hierarchies. One urgent question
for further investigation is how the process of assurance and deference
operate at the topmost levels of a hierarchy? When we have two great
powers of unequal strength but contesting claims and a closing
capabilities gap in the same regional hierarchy, how much scope for
negotiation is there, before a reversion to balancing dynamics? This is
the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not give
up its primary position in the Asian regional hierarchy, China is very
unlikely to act in a way that will provide comforting answers to the two
questions. Yet, **[the East Asian regional order]{.underline}** has been
and still **[is constituted by US hegemony, and to change that could be
extremely disruptive and may lead to regional actors acting in highly
destabilizing ways. Rapid Japanese remilitarization, armed conflict
across the Taiwan Straits, Indian nuclear brinksmanship directed toward
Pakistan, or a highly destabilized Korean peninsula are all illustrative
of potential regional disruptions.]{.underline}** 5. Conclusion To
construct a coherent account of East Asia\'s evolving security order, I
have suggested that **[the United States is the central force in
constituting regional stability and order.]{.underline}** The major
patterns of equilibrium and turbulence in the region since 1945 can be
explained by the relative stability of the US position at the top of the
regional hierarchy, with [**periods of greatest insecurity being
correlated with greatest uncertainty over the American commitment to
managing regional order**.]{.underline} Furthermore, relationships of
hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference explain the unusual
character of regional order in the post-Cold War era. However, the
greatest contemporary challenge to East Asian order is the potential
conflict between China and the United States over rank ordering in the
regional hierarchy, a contest made more potent because of the
inter-twining of regional and global security concerns. Ultimately,
though, investigating such questions of positionality requires
conceptual lenses that go beyond basic material factors because it
entails social and normative questions. How can China be brought more
into a leadership position, while being persuaded to buy into shared
strategic interests and constrain its own in ways that its vision of
regional and global security may eventually be reconciled with that of
the United States and other regional players? How can Washington be
persuaded that its central position in the hierarchy must be ultimately
shared in ways yet to be determined? **[The future of the East Asian
security order is tightly bound up with the durability of the United
States\' global leadership and regional domination. At the regional
level, the main scenarios of disruption are an outright Chinese
challenge to US leadership, or the defection of key US allies,
particularly Japan.]{.underline}** Recent history suggests, and the
preceding analysis has shown, that challenges to or **[defections from
US leadership will come at junctures where it appears that the US
commitment to the region is in doubt, which in turn destabilizes the
hierarchical order.]{.underline}** At the global level, American
geopolitical over-extension will be the key cause of change. This is the
one factor that could lead to both greater regional and global
turbulence, if only by the attendant strategic uncertainly triggering
off regional challenges or defections. However, it is notoriously
difficult to gauge thresholds of over-extension. More positively, East
Asia is a region that has adjusted to previous periods of uncertainty
about US primacy. Arguably, the regional consensus over the United
States as primary state in a system of benign hierarchy could
accommodate a shifting of the strategic burden to US allies like Japan
and Australia as a means of systemic preservation. The alternatives that
could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse.

#### Guaranteed Taiwanese proliferation means war with China -- destabilizes Asia 

**Mizokami 18** (Kyle Mizokami, defense and national-security writer for
the Diplomat and Foreign Policy, "Taiwan Was 5 Years Away From Building
A Nuclear Weapon",
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/taiwan-was-5-years-away-building-nuclear-weapon-28927>)

[Taiwan's nuclear-weapons program, although understandable, was ill
considered. A **Taiwanese-Chinese nuclear standoff would have
destabilized the entire region**---ironic, considering Taiwan was
seeking nuclear weapons to stabilize its defense posture. There was
really no military dilemma that Taiwanese nuclear weapons would have
decisively solved; **any strike would have only been made worse by the
inevitable Chinese nuclear counterattack. It would have
been**]{.underline} **[one of the greatest crises of postwar
Asia]{.underline}**: the revelation of a Taiwanese atomic bomb. For
Taiwan, the bomb would have evened the odds against a numerically
superior foe. **[For China, a bomb would have been]{.underline}** casus
belli, **[justification for an attack on the island
country]{.underline}** it considered a rogue province. Active from the
1960s to the 1980s, Taipei's efforts to develop nuclear weapons were
finally abandoned due to diplomatic pressure by its most important ally,
the United States. [(This first appeared last year.)]{.underline}
Taiwan's nuclear program goes back to 1964, when the People's Republic
of China tested its first nuclear device. The test was not exactly a
surprise to outside observers, but it was still Taiwan's nightmare come
true. Chinese and Taiwanese air and naval forces occasionally
skirmished, and it [threatened to **turn into all-out
war**]{.underline}. Suddenly Taipei was confronted with the possibility
that such a war could turn nuclear. Even just one nuclear device
detonated on an island the size of Maryland would have devastating
consequences for the civilian population. **[From Taiwan's perspective,
a nuclear arsenal would be the ultimate guarantor of national
sovereignty]{.underline}**. **[Even if the United States split with the
country]{.underline}**, as it eventually did, **[Taiwanese
nukes]{.underline}** **[would keep the Chinese People's Liberation Army
at bay, a deterrent]{.underline}** not only **[against Chinese nuclear
power]{.underline}**, but against conventional forces as well. In
hindsight, **[this would have had a good chance of success, as North
Korea's own procurement of nuclear weapons has made the United States
and South Korea reluctant to retaliate over the country's various
military provocations.]{.underline}**

[No doubt **Taiwan** still has time to acquire a nuclear deterrent
before the balance of power in Asia shifts decisively against
it.]{.underline} But the problem with this suggestion is that both
Beijing and Washington are sure to oppose Taiwan going nuclear. The
United States would oppose Taiwanese nuclear weapons, not only because
they would encourage Japan and South Korea to follow suit, but also
because American policy makers abhor the idea of an ally being in a
position to start a nuclear war that might ultimately involve the United
States. To put it bluntly, [no American wants to be in a situation where
Taiwan can **precipitate a conflict** that might result in a **massive
nuclear attack** on the United States. China will **adamantly oppose**
Taiwan obtaining a nuclear deterrent, in large part because Beijing
surely understands that it would make it difficult]{.underline}---maybe
even impossible---to conquer Taiwan. What's more, [China will recognize
that Taiwanese nuclear weapons would facilitate **nuclear
proliferation** in East Asia, which would not only limit China's ability
to throw its weight around in that region, but also would increase the
likelihood that any conventional war that breaks out would escalate to
the nuclear level.]{.underline} For these reasons, [China is likely to
make it manifestly clear that if Taiwan decides to pursue nuclear
weapons, it will **strike** its nuclear facilities, and maybe even
**launch a war** to conquer the island.]{.underline} In short, it
appears that it is too late for Taiwan to pursue the nuclear option.

the supply of defensive weapons and maintaining a U.S. capability in the
region to help Taiwan. They have prevented successive administrations
from pressuring Taiwan into cross-Strait negotiations or undertaking
mediation, lest Washington become responsible for implementing
agreements and managing the consequences of failure. [Various U.S.

Diplomats, the Pentagon, scholars, and other analysts have argued

sell 150 fighters to Taipei during the 1992 presidential election
campaign, hoping to insure re-election by providing a \$4 billion
contract and 5,800 jobs to General Dynamics' operations in Texas.7 In
2011, a bipartisan group of 45 U.S. senators advocating new F-16 sales
and upgrades of existing aircraft not only warned President Obama that
Taiwan would be forced to ground some 70 percent of its fighters by 2020
without U.S. action, but that Lockheed Martin's F-16 **[production line

analysts estimate this would mean the loss of some 11,000 jobs in 43
states.8 Another side to U.S. abandonment of Taiwan is the trajectory of
events that would follow such a momentous alteration of U.S. policy.
Would it help or hurt U.S. interests that Taiwan, almost certainly,
would not be able to sustain its de facto independence, and would be
compelled, in some form, to accommodate China's unification agenda? That
alone could be profoundly disturbing to American liberals as well as
conservatives for whom Taiwan's vibrant democracy has appeared to be a
vanguard for political development in Asia. China has promised it would
not station forces on Taiwan, use the island to project power into the
Pacific, interfere with critical commercial and military sea lanes, or
control Taiwan's affairs apart from foreign and military relations. It
has pledged to facilitate Taiwan's presence in international
organizations and be generous in multiplying and deepening economic
ties. But [as the application of China's ''one country, two systems''
formula in Hong Kong has demonstrated, 26 nurturing democratic
institutions under a communist umbrella is all but
impossible.]{.underline} So if China were to be perceived as coercive,

https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/01/jimmy-carter-how-to-repair-the-u-s-china-relationship-and-prevent-a-modern-cold-war/)

Forty years ago, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and I normalized
diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the
United States, putting an end to three decades of hostility. This led to
an era distinguished by peace in East Asia and the Pacific region.
China's spectacular economic growth, in conjunction with its continuing
integration with the much larger U.S. economy, has enabled the two
countries to become engines of global prosperity. Scientific and
cultural exchanges have blossomed, and the United States has since
become the top foreign destination for Chinese scholars and tourists.
The 40th anniversary of this relationship is a testament to the ability
of countries with different histories, cultures and political systems to
work together for the greater good. Yet, today, this critical
relationship is in jeopardy. I hear Chinese elites claiming that
Americans are conducting an "evil conspiracy" to destabilize China. I
hear prominent Americans, disappointed that China has not become a
democracy, claiming that China poses a threat to the American way of
life. U.S. government reports declare that China is dedicated to
challenging U.S. supremacy, and that it is planning to drive the United
States out of Asia and reduce its influence in other countries around
the world. If top government officials embrace these dangerous notions,
a modern Cold War between our two nations is not inconceivable. At this
sensitive moment, misperceptions, miscalculations and failure to follow
carefully defined rules of engagement in areas such as the Taiwan Strait
and South China Sea could escalate into military conflict, creating a
worldwide catastrophe. **[[The U.S. imposition of tariffs on \$200
billion worth of Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory tariffs,
contribute to the deteriorating relationship, hurting both
countries.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The 90-day pause in further escalation
of tariffs, agreed to at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina, offers the
possibility of reaching a permanent agreement on U.S.-China trade. What
can we do to build on this progress, and to repair the U.S.-China
relationship? First, the United States' long-standing complaints ---
about trade imbalances, intellectual property theft, forced technology
transfers, and unfair barriers to U.S. investments and business
operations in China --- must be addressed quickly and effectively.
**[[Neither country should use "national security" as an excuse to
obstruct the other's legitimate commercial activities. China needs
competition for its economy to innovate and grow]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
pursuing a fair and reciprocal relationship is the only way for both
countries to remain economically strong. Second, **[Americans must
acknowledge that, just as China has no right to interfere in U.S.
affairs, we have no inherent right to dictate to China how to govern its
people or choose its leaders]{.underline}**. Though even countries with
the closest of relationships may critique each other at times, such
engagements should never become directives or edicts; they should rather
serve as a two-way street of open dialogue. China's achievements in
sustaining economic growth, alleviating abject poverty and providing
developmental assistance to other countries need to be celebrated. At
the same time, we cannot ignore its deficiencies in internet censorship,
policies toward minorities and religious restrictions --- which should
be recorded and criticized. This balanced approach is key to ensuring
that the United States and China continue to work together toward
solving some of the most intractable global problems. Despite current
tensions on other issues, Chinese support has been essential in our
ongoing efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Beijing also could
offer crucial help in post-conflict reconstruction in the Middle East
and Africa, countering terrorism and extremism, and mediating other
international disputes. **[[The United States should return to the Paris
climate accord and work with China on environmental and climate-change
issues,]{.mark} as the epic struggle against global warming requires
active participation from both nations.]{.underline}** But I **[believe
[the easiest route to bilateral cooperation]{.mark} [lies in
Africa]{.mark}. [Both countries are]{.mark} already [heavily
involved]{.mark} there [in]{.mark} fighting [disease]{.mark}, building
[infrastructure and]{.mark} keeping [peace]{.mark} --- sometimes
cooperatively. Yet each nation has accused the other of economic
exploitation or political manipulation. Africans --- like billions of
other people around the world --- do not want to be forced to choose a
side. Instead, they welcome the synergy that comes from pooling
resources, sharing expertise and designing complementary aid programs.
[By working together with Africans, the United States and China would
also be helping themselves overcome distrust and rebuild this vital
relationship]{.mark}. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping and I knew we were
advancing the cause of peace. While today's leaders face a different
world, the cause of peace remains just as important. Leaders must bring
new vision, courage and ingenuity to new challenges and opportunities,
but I believe they also must accept our conviction that the United
States and China need to build their futures together, for themselves
and for humanity at large.]{.underline}**

activism and secessionism among Muslims in Xinjiang. Tibetans, who

Sino--American relations to read, then, that China and the U.S. have a
mutual interests in pursuing the War on Drugs, a controversial American
enterprise. "The competition between the U.S. and China doesn't mean
there can't be cooperation on combating opiates and opioids," noted
Jeffrey Higgins, a former supervisory special agent in the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA). "China has a growing drug problem,
despite its draconian drug laws. This gives China a compelling interest
in collaborating with any country to combat drugs." The history of China
and the Western world's cooperation on and conflict over drugs began
with the Opium Wars in the 1800s, when the British Empire pushed China
to accept the illegal drug trade. The problems that Britain started
continue today: the Chinese government has established over 500
counternarcotics guidelines and laws, more than any other country in the
world, including the U.S., which itself is facing an opioid epidemic
from New Hampshire to New Mexico. In 2016, the Chinese government's
seizures of synthetic drugs, such as ketamine and methamphetamine,
soared by 106 percent, suggesting that whatever strategy China has
pursued is failing to contain its own epidemic. [China's [difficulties
have spread]{.mark} to the U.S. [through
**fentanyl**]{.mark}]{.underline}, an opioid painkiller 50 times
stronger (and thus deadlier) than heroin. This May, the Justice
Department indicted six people in Utah for purchasing fentanyl from
China, where clandestine chemists can purchase the precursors necessary
for its production with ease. Chinese traffickers then ship fentanyl to
American customers or middlemen through arrangements made on the dark
web, a subsection of the Internet hidden in overlay networks requiring
unique software to access. The secrecy of this method has already
hindered coordination between China and Canada, which is struggling like
the US. .to battle the spread of the illegal drug trade from China
through its borders. Mike Vigil, former Chief of International
Operations for the DEA, praised China's efforts. "Much to their credit,
they have included at least 134 fentanyl analogs in their controlled
substances list," he told The Diplomat in an email. "Unfortunately, the
laboratories quickly change the molecular structure of the opioids,
thereby forcing China to control the new analogs. It takes eight months
to a year to put them on their list of controlled substances." This June
and under American pressure, China banned U-47700, a drug that acted as
a legal alternative to fentanyl. Chinese chemists remain a step ahead of
the of the Chinese government, though, devising new products faster than
authorities in Beijing can respond. A vendor on AlphaBay Market, a
darknet market, even felt bold enough to film his Chinese operations.
This March, DEA spokesman Rusty Payne noted that [**stopping** the
**shipment of fentanyl** from China to the U]{.underline}nited States
[remained one of the **law enforcement agency's biggest
priorities**]{.underline}. To achieve its goals, [[the **DEA will** have
to **improve coop**]{.mark}**eration and coordination** [with]{.mark}
its **[Chinese counterparts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "The DEA has been
working hard behind the scenes there for the past several years to
convince the Chinese that they have a serious illegal fentanyl
production problem that is entering the illegal market, and to assist
with sharing intelligence and working closely with the DEA's
counterparts throughout the various provinces," a former senior DEA
official who had helped supervise agreements with China told The
Diplomat. "It's true that, historically, the working relationship
between the U.S. and China in general has been strained, but, on
narcotics trafficking, there have always been fairly quiet and
constructive engagements." Higgins and Vigil concurred. "While China may
not be willing to designate resources to help the U.S. fight drugs in
general, the Chinese should be amenable to cooperating with the
investigation and dismantlement of drug trafficking organizations that
pose a threat to China," Higgins argued. Vigil added: "China's efforts
to curb its own opioid epidemic also help the U.S. and other countries
impede the movement of illegal opioids coming from that country. China
is aggressively trying to control the production of illicit opioids and
is working closely with the US in the sharing of information." The DEA's
work with China has yielded some significant successes. Last month, the
Justice Department announced the closure of AlphaBay, which it described
as "the largest online 'darknet market'" and "the largest criminal
marketplace on the Internet." Thai authorities arrested AlphaBay's
founder, Canadian Alexandre Cazes, on Washington's behalf. [The
**enterprising nature** of American and Chinese traffickers, however,
implies that China and the DEA have **much more work to
do**]{.underline}. Though the former DEA special agents whom The
Diplomat interviewed seemed skeptical that recent tensions between China
and the United States could torpedo their mutual interest in the War on
Drugs, they highlighted several difficulties complicating the
relationship. "Much of the world's fentanyl comes out of China, so the
Chinese government did have a natural conflict of interest in stopping
the flow of fentanyl to the U.S.," observed Higgins. The former senior
DEA official, who requested anonymity, concluded: "Could it be better?
Yes. Is there a growing corruption problem there? Yes." [[As China and
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [look to reach an understanding on

### 2NC China Relations CP -- FONOPS 

#### Ending freedom of navigation operations in the SCS drastically decreases US-China tensions and improves relations 

**Carpenter 18** (Carpenter, Ted Galen. "A Modest US Concession Can
Reduce Tensions in the South China Sea." Cato Institute, 13 Aug. 2018,
www.cato.org/publications/commentary/modest-us-concession-can-reduce-tensions-south-china-sea.)

Tensions between China and the United States are rising on multiple
fronts. The onset of dueling tariffs is threatening to trigger a
full-fledged bilateral trade war. Beijing's anger is rising about
Washington's growing attempts to upgrade diplomatic and military ties
with Taiwan. Finally, the two countries are sparring dangerously over
their respective policies and goals in the South China Sea. [All of
those disputes are dangerous, but [the]{.mark}]{.underline} Taiwan [and
**[South China Sea]{.mark}** issues [hold the most potential for
**poisoning the bilateral relationship**]{.mark} and escalating into
war. [Compromise regarding **Taiwan** is **inherently
elusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but a **modest change** in U.S. policy
could **significantly dampen tensions**]{.mark} in the South China Sea.
Specifically, [Washington needs to **dramatically reduce**]{.mark}
[its]{.mark} confrontational "**[freedom of navigation]{.mark}**"
[patrols]{.mark} and stop treating Beijing as a disruptive element, if
not an outright threat, in that region]{.underline}. One longstanding
reason for a large-scale U.S. naval presence in the western Pacific is
the importance of unimpeded shipping to the health of the global
economy. U.S. political and economic leaders fret about potential
disruptions to the flow of commerce and have done so for decades. That
is an understandable concern. The United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development
(UNCTAD) [estimates](http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/rmt2015_en.pdf) that
80% of world trade measured by volume and 70% measured by value travels
by sea. The sea lanes transiting the South China Sea are especially
crucial arteries. UNCTAD's analysis shows that one-third of global
shipping passes through that body of water. A conservative estimate of
the annual dollar value by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies' [China Power
Project](https://chinapower.csis.org/much-trade-transits-south-china-sea/) put
the figure at \$3.37 trillion, but concedes that other estimates are as
high as \$5.3 trillion. The CSIS study emphasizes that the waters "are
particularly critical for China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, all of
which rely on the Strait of Malacca, which connects the South China Sea
and, by extension, the Pacific Ocean with the Indian Ocean." U.S.
leaders increasingly view China as a potential menace to that commerce.
The root of Washington's suspicion is the extent and intensity of
Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea. It is not a new
issue. In December 1947, the government of the Republic of China (Chiang
Kai-shek's regime) issued a map delineating an 11-dash line (later
reduced to a 9-dash line) that laid claim to more than 80% of the South
China Sea. The communist regime that overthrew Chiang two years later
and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) subsequently
embraced that claim. Until the past decade or so, though, Beijing's
audacious territorial ambition remained little more than theoretical.
The PRC lacked the military power to make even a credible effort to
enforce its claims. But as China's economic and military power has
grown, PRC leaders have become more insistent that most of the South
China Sea is rightfully Chinese territorial waters. Beijing also has
dredged areas surrounding partially sunken reefs to expand the land
areas on those reefs into full-fledged artificial islands. Even more
troubling from the U.S. perspective, China has built structures,
including military airstrips, on those new islands. Although China is
not the only country to pursue such reclamation projects (Vietnam, in
particular, also has done so), the PRC's program is the most extensive.
Washington has flatly rejected Beijing's stance regarding the South
China Sea. U.S. officials have
repeatedly [condemned](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/politics/us-warning-south-china-sea/index.html) the
creation of artificial islands, especially China's building of military
installations. The U.S. Navy also has [increased the
frequency](https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1IZ03B-OCATP) of
patrols through the South China Sea and explicitly labeled them 'freedom
of navigation patrols.' That term implies that Washington regards
China's growing presence, including an increase in PRC naval activities,
as a potential threat to free navigation. Beijing, in turn, has [reacted
angrily](https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/china-condemns-us-fonop-near-mischief-reef-in-the-south-china-sea/)
to intrusive U.S. patrols so close to the Chinese homeland, condemning
them as a [serious
provocation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/warship-island-provocation-china-170703002140998.html).
[Washington needs to reconsider its policy in the South China
Sea.]{.underline} The PRC's territorial claims are not justified by
either history or law --- as the International Court of Arbitration
[ruled](https://thediplomat.com/2016/07/international-court-issues-unanimous-award-in-philippines-v-china-case-on-south-china-sea/) in
2016 in a case brought by the Philippines against Beijing. But given its
own extensive shipping that transits the South China Sea, the PRC also
has a powerful incentive to keep the waterway open. The amount of
Chinese exports transported through that body of water is larger than
that of any other country, accounting for nearly 25% of the overall
flow. Indeed,
some [40%](https://chinapower.csis.org/much-trade-transits-south-china-sea/) of
China's total exports travel those sea lanes. PRC leaders know that if
they disrupt that commerce, the United States (and other naval powers
such as Japan and Australia) could easily choke-off the flow of Chinese
products as well. Given its export-driven economy, causing problems in
the South China Sea would be an especially foolish policy for Beijing to
adopt. Chinese leaders seem to recognize that point, as evidenced by
their work with member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) to establish a "[code of
conduct](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2158017/china-and-asean-reach-milestone-draft-deal-south-china)"
that could minimize disputes in the South China Sea. Instead of viewing
China as a potential threat to South China Sea commerce, the Trump
administration should recognize that the PRC can be a useful partner in
helping to keep the sea lanes open. One should not expect Beijing to
abandon its territorial claims, and that stance will always have a
somewhat menacing potential. Chinese leaders undoubtedly want their
country to be recognized as the leading power in the South China Sea;
Washington cannot possibly achieve the goal of having Beijing accept
continued U.S. hegemony there. At the same time, the United States has
no intention of acquiescing in the PRC's legal quest to convert the
South China Sea into Chinese territorial waters. There is little chance
of a comprehensive settlement to completely resolve such an impasse in
the foreseeable future. But the two sides can reach a more limited
accommodation that would reduce the upward trend in dangerous tensions.
[The **main problem**]{.underline} [is China's anger about the U.S.
Navy's freedom of navigation patrols. [U.S. leaders should offer]{.mark}
[to **greatly reduce**]{.mark} the number of those [patrols]{.mark}, and
avoid sending them into the vicinity of Chinese-built artificial
islands,]{.underline} as long as Beijing is willing to offer formal
assurances that it will take no action to disrupt shipping through the
South China Sea, and will, in fact, work to combat existing threats,
most notably the continued problem of piracy in waters near the vital
Strait of Malacca. [[Such a]{.mark} **de facto truce** and **[modus
vivendi]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} not guarantee lasting harmony regarding
the South China Sea. However, it would **[markedly reduce diplomatic
strain]{.mark}** [between Beijing and Washington]{.mark} ---
[and]{.mark}, perhaps even more importantly, **[decrease]{.mark} the
[mounting tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the naval forces of
the two countries[. That potential achievement is well worth Washington
taking the initiative and offering such a proposal to
Beijing.]{.underline}
