## Black Radical Liberalism

### General Stuff

#### What does Mills mean by liberalism?/racial liberalism

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "New Left Project Interview with Charles
Mills" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism"
Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

[By liberalism I mean the ideology that arises in Europe in the
seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in opposition to feudal absolutism,
predicated on the equal rights of morally equal individuals, and having
as its key figures such political thinkers as John Locke, David Hume,
Immanuel Kant, Adam Smith, and John Stuart Mill. Obviously]{.underline},
as even this brief list indicates, [there are many different strains
within liberalism]{.underline}: contractarian versus utilitarian
versions, property-and-selfownership-based versus personhood-based
versions, right-wing laissezfaire liberalism versus left-wing
social-democratic liberalism. [But in theory all these different
variants are supposed to be committed to the flourishing of the
individual. What I call "racial liberalism" is then a liberalism in
which--- independent of which particular version we're considering---key
terms have been rewritten by race so as to generate a different set of
rules for members of different "races]{.underline}," R1s and R2s,
because (historically) the R2s don't meet the criteria of the capacity
for attaining individuality. So I am following the example of
second-wave feminist liberals from the 1970s onward and arguing that [we
need to see liberalism as structurally shaped in its development by
group privilege ---in this case, white racial privilege.]{.underline}
"Racial liberalism" as a theoretical construct is then supposed to be
analogous to "patriarchal liberalism."

#### Basic definition/values of liberalism that we reclaim

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

Here is a characterization of liberalism from a very respectable source,
the British political theorist, John Gray: [Common to all variants of
the liberal tradition is a definite conception]{.underline},
distinctively modern in character, of man and society... . It [is
individualist, in that it asserts the moral primacy of the person
against the claims of any social collectivity; egalitarian, inasmuch as
it confers on all men the same moral status and denies the relevance to
legal or political order of differences in moral worth among human
beings; universalist, affirming the moral unity of the human species and
according a secondary importance to specific historic associations and
cultural forms; and meliorist in its affirmation of the corrigibility
and improvability of all social institutions and political
arrangements.]{.underline} It is this conception of man and society
which gives liberalism a definite identity which transcends its vast
internal variety and complexity. [What generate the different varieties
of liberalism are different concepts of individualism, different claims
about how egalitarianism should be construed or realized, more or less
inclusionary readings of universalism]{.underline} (Gray's
characterization sanitizes liberalism's actual sexist and racist
history), [different views of what count as desirable improvements,
conflicting normative balancings of liberal values]{.underline}
(freedom, equality) [and competing theoretical prognoses about how best
they can be realized in the light of]{.underline} (contested)
[socio-historical facts]{.underline}. The huge potential for
disagreement about all of these explains how a common liberal core can
produce such a wide range of variants. Moreover, [we need to take into
account not merely the spectrum of actual liberalisms but also
hypothetical liberalisms that could be generated through novel framings
of some or all of the above]{.underline}. So one would need to
differentiate dominant versions of liberalism from oppositional
versions, and actual from possible variants.

### Reclaim Liberalism Good -- Most Strategic

#### Liberalism's role in racist violence is the result of group interests and not intrinsic to liberalism itself -- justifying a radical agenda with the normative resources of liberalism is the most strategic form of resistance

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

Once the breadth of the range of liberalisms is appreciated---dominant
and subordinate, actual and potential---[the obvious question then
raised is this: even if actual dominant liberalisms have been
conservative in various ways (corporate, patriarchal, racist) why does
this rule out the development of emancipatory, radical
liberalisms?]{.underline} One kind of answer is the following (call this
the internalist answer): because there is an immanent
conceptual/normative logic to liberalism as a political ideology that
precludes any emancipatory development of it. Another kind of answer is
the following (call this the externalist answer): [it doesn't. The
historic domination of conservative exclusionary liberalisms is the
result of group interests, group power, and successful group political
projects]{.underline}. [Apparent internal conceptual/ normative barriers
to an emancipatory liberalism can be successfully negotiated by drawing
on the conceptual/normative resources of liberalism itself, in
conjunction with a revisionist socio-historical picture of
modernity.]{.underline} Most self-described radicals would
endorse---indeed, reflexively, as an obvious truth---the first answer.
But as indicated from the beginning, I think the second answer is
actually the correct one. [The obstacles to developing a "radical
liberalism" are, in my opinion, primarily externalist in nature:
material group interests, and the way they have shaped hegemonic
varieties of liberalism.]{.underline} So I think [we need to try to
justify a radical agenda with the normative resources of liberalism
rather than writing off liberalism.]{.underline} Since liberalism has
always been the dominant ideology in the United States and is now
globally hegemonic, [such a project would have the great ideological
advantage of appealing to values and principles that most people already
endorse.]{.underline} [All projects of egalitarian social transformation
are going to face a combination of material, political, and ideological
obstacles, but this strategy would at least reduce somewhat the
dimensions of the last]{.underline}. One would be trying to win mass
support for policies that---and the challenge will, of course, be to
demonstrate this---are justifiable by majoritarian norms, once
reconceived and put in conjunction with facts not always familiar to the
majority. [Material barriers (vested group interests) and political
barriers (organizational difficulties) will of course remain. But they
will constitute a general obstacle for all egalitarian political
programs, and as such cannot be claimed to be peculiar problems for an
emancipatory liberalism.]{.underline}

#### Liberalism should be reclaimed for a radical agenda -- its key to build a broad democratic movement persuasive to a wide range of people and its not inherently tied to white supremacy but contingent on group interests

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

The "Occupy!" movement, which has made headlines around the country, has
raised the hopes of young American radicals new to political engagement
and revived the hopes of an older generation of radicals still clinging
to nostalgic dreams of the glorious '60s[. If the original and still
most salient target was Wall Street, a long list of other candidates for
"occupation" has since been put forward]{.underline}. [In this chapter,
I want to propose as a target for radical occupation the somewhat
unusual candidate of liberalism itself. But contrary to the
conventional. wisdom prevailing within radical circles, I am going to
argue for the heretical thesis that liberalism should not be
contemptuously rejected by radicals but retrieved for a radical
agenda]{.underline}. Summarized in bulletpoint form, my argument is as
follows: • [The "Occupy Wall Street" movement provides an opportunity
unprecedented in decades to build a broad democratic movement to
challenge plutocracy, patriarchy, and white supremacy in the United
States]{.underline}. • [Such a movement is more likely to be successful
if it appeals to principles and values most Americans already
endorse]{.underline}. • [Liberalism has always been the dominant
ideology in the United States]{.underline}. • [Liberalism in the United
States has historically been complicit with]{.underline} plutocracy,
patriarchy, and [white supremacy, but this complicity is a contingent
function of dominant group interests rather than the result of an
immanent conceptual logic]{.underline}. • Therefore, [progressives in
philosophy (and elsewhere) should try to retrieve liberalism for a
radical democratic agenda rather than rejecting it, thereby positioning
themselves in the ideological mainstream of the country and seeking its
transformation.]{.underline}

### [Reclaim Liberalism Good - Reclaim Normative Values Good]{.underline}

#### Pointing out the antiblack history of liberalism does not refute the normative worth of its values -- freedom, egalitarianism, etc are key to articulating radical demands

Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

critiques of his argument and answers them

5\. Liberalism's Values (Independently of the Ontology Question) Are
Themselves Problematic Even if the ontological challenge can be beaten
back, though, another front remains open. [It will be argued that
liberal humanist values are themselves problematic in nature and
incapable of advancing a radical agenda. But the obvious reply is, Which
values?]{.underline} And what exactly is the problem supposed to be: (a)
that the values are intrinsically problematic? (b) that the values
involved have historically been extended in an exclusionary
discriminatory way? (c) that the values have been developed in a fashion
that is predicated on the experience of the privileged? These are all
different claims. Start with the first. Admittedly, [some values
associated with the liberal tradition could be judged to be
intrinsically problematic, such as the "possessive
individualism"]{.underline} C. B. Macpherson famously attributed to
Hobbes and Locke.18 [But this is a value specific to right-wing
liberalism, not liberalism in general]{.underline} (it does not appear
on Gray's list), and would be opposed by left-wing/social democratic
liberalism. [Such values as "freedom," "equality" (moral
egalitarianism),]{.underline} and "fraternity/ sorority" [classically
emblematic of the liberal tradition have not usually been seen as
problematic by radicals and have indeed been emblazoned on radical
banners]{.underline}. [Freedom from oppression, equal rights/equal pay/
equal citizenship ("I AM A MAN"), fraternity/sorority with the
subordinated]{.underline} ("Am I not a man and a brother? Am I not a
woman and a sister?") [have all served as values for progressive
movements seeking social emancipation.]{.underline} To be sure, [it is a
familiar point to radicals]{.underline}, if somewhat less so to the
non-radical majority, [that the population as a whole has not
historically been recognized as deserving the protections of these
norms, so that the opponents of emancipation have all too often
themselves been liberals.]{.underline} [Freedom has been construed as
justifiably resting on the enslavement of some; equality has been
restricted to those deemed worthy of it]{.underline} (i.e., those more
equal than others); fraternity has been literal, an all-boys' club.
Domenico Losurdo's recently translated Liberalism: A Counter-History
provides a devastating exposé of "liberal thought \[not\] in its
abstract purity, but liberalism, and hence the liberal movement and
liberal society, in their concrete reality." It is an illuminatingly
sordid history of the ideology's complicity with racial slavery, white
working-class indentureship, colonialism and imperialism ("A
'Master-Race Democracy' on a Planetary Scale," in one chapter's title),
and the conceptual connection between the Nazi "final solution" and
Europe's earlier extermination programs against indigenous peoples.19
Yet it is noteworthy that in his concluding pages, Losurdo still affirms
the "merits and strong points of the intellectual tradition under
examination." His "counter-history" has been aimed at dispelling the
"habitual hagiography" that surrounds liberalism, and the related "myth
of the gradual, peaceful transition, on the basis of purely internal
motivations and impulses, from liberalism to democracy, or from general
enjoyment of negative liberty to an ever wider recognition of political
rights."20 In reality, he emphasizes, "[the classics of the liberal
tradition" were generally hostile to democracy; the "exclusion clauses"
required "violent upheavals" to be overcome; progress was not linear but
a matter of advances and retreats; external crisis often played a
crucial role; and]{.underline} white working-class and [black inclusion
in the polity came at the cost of their participation in colonial wars
against native peoples]{.underline}.21 [Nonetheless]{.underline}, his
final paragraph insists: [However difficult such an operation might be
for those committed to overcoming liberalism's exclusion clauses, to
take up the legacy of this intellectual tradition is an absolutely
unavoidable task]{.underline}... . \[[L\]‌iberalism's merits are too
significant and too evident for it to be necessary to credit it with
other, completely imaginary ones.]{.underline} Among the latter is the
alleged spontaneous capacity for self-correction often attributed to
it... . Only in opposition to \[such\] pervasive repressions and
transfigurations is the book now ending presented as a
"counter-history": bidding farewell to hagiography is the precondition
for landing on the firm ground of history.22 So for Losurdo [one can
accept the indictment of actual historic liberalism, and its failure to
live up to its putative universalism, without going on to conclude
either that liberalism must therefore be abandoned or that liberalism's
own internal dynamic will naturally correct itself]{.underline}. Rather,
the appropriate conclusion is that [liberalism can be retrieved, but
that it will take political struggle to do so.]{.underline} Finally,
even when the "exclusion clauses" are formally overcome, their legacy
may well remain in the form of values now nominally extended to
everybody, but in reality articulated in such a fashion as to continue
to reproduce group privilege---for example, a "freedom" that repudiates
caste status but does not recognize illicit economic constraint as
unfairly limiting liberty, or an "autonomy" that does not acknowledge
the role of female caregiving in enabling human development, or a
"justice" resolutely forward-looking that blocks issues of rectification
of past injustices. But [what such tendentious conceptual framings
arguably call for is a critique and a rethinking of these values and
principles in the light of these exclusions]{.underline} (as with left,
feminist, and black liberalism). [That does not refute their normative
worth; it just underlines the necessity for taking the whole population
into account in revising them and developing a blueprint of their
internal architecture adequately sensitized to the differential social
location and social history of such groups, particularly those
traditionally oppressed.]{.underline}

### [Liberalism Not Inherently Bad/Contingency Good]{.underline}

#### Recognizing contingency in liberalism's role in antiblack racism is key to reformulating it -- monolithic rejections of liberalism eschew options for emancipation

Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University

Note: this is from one of the sections where Mills lays out potential
critiques of his argument and answers them

[10. American Liberalism in Particular Has Been so Shaped in Its
Development by Race that Any Emancipatory Possibilities Have Been
Foreclosed]{.underline} [Liberalism in general]{.underline} (both
nationally and internationally) [has been shaped by race, but that does
not preclude reclaiming it.]{.underline}32 Moreover, [it is precisely
such shaping that motivates the imperative of recognizing the
multiplicity of liberalisms,]{.underline} not merely for cataloging
purposes but in order to frame them as theoretical objects whose dynamic
requires investigation. [The conflation of all liberalisms with their
racialized versions obstructs seeing these ideologies as historically
contingent varieties of liberalism, which could have developed
otherwise]{.underline}. A Brechtian "defamiliarization" is necessary, a
cognitive distancing that "denaturalizes" what is prone to appear as the
essence of liberalism. Jennifer Pitts's A Turn to Empire, for example,
which is subtitled The Rise of Imperial Liberalism in Britain and
France, and Sankar Muthu's Enlightenment against Empire, both seek to
demarcate within liberalism the existence of anti- as well as
pro-imperialist strains, thereby demonstrating that [liberalism is not a
monolith]{.underline}.33 Admittedly, other scholars have been more
ambivalent about some of their supposed exemplars; see, for example,
Losurdo, already cited, and John Hobson's recent The Eurocentric
Conception of World Politics, which develops a detailed and
sophisticated taxonomy of varieties of Eurocentrism and imperialism that
demonstrates the compatibility of racism, Eurocentrism, and
anti-imperialism.34 (For instance, many European liberal theorists were
anti-imperialist precisely because of their racism---their fears that
the white race would degenerate as a result of miscegenation with
inferior races and the deleterious consequences of prolonged residence
in the unsuitable tropical climates of colonial outposts.) But the mere
fact of such a range of positions illustrates that a liberalism neither
Eurocentric nor imperialist is not a contradiction in terms. [In the
United States]{.underline} in particular, as Rogers Smith has
demonstrated, [liberalism and racism have been intricately involved with
one another from the nation's inception]{.underline}, a relationship
Smith conceptualizes in terms of conflicting "multiple traditions,"
racism versus liberal universalism, and which I see as a conflict
between "racial liberalism" and non-racial liberalism.35 My belief is
that [formally identifying "racial liberalism" as a particular
evolutionary]{.underline} (and always evolving) [ideological
phenomenon]{.underline} [better enables us to understand the role of
race in writing and rewriting the most important political philosophy in
the nation's history, from the overtly racist liberalism of the past to
the nominally color-blind liberalism of the present]{.underline}. From
the eighteenth- to nineteenth-century accommodation to racial slavery
and aboriginal expropriation to the twentieth-century tainting of
welfare and social democracy on this side of the Atlantic,36 race has
refracted crucial terms, concepts, and values in liberal theory so as to
remove any cognitive dissonance between the privileging of whites and
the subordination of people of color. Correspondingly, [the shaping of
white moral psychology by race and the distinctive patterns of uptake of
abstract liberal values ("equality," "individualism")]{.underline} in
such a psychology [then become legitimate objects of investigation for
us]{.underline}.37 [One begins from the assumption that these norms will
be color-coded in their actual operationalization, so that any
efficacious framing of an interracial political project will need to
anticipate and correct for this differential understanding rather than
being naively surprised by it.]{.underline} But such racialization (as
popular interpretation and reception) is going to be a common problem
for any American ideology with emancipatory pretensions. Liberalism is
certainly not unique in that respect, as the history of the white
American left and socialist movements illustrates. As Jack London
famously put it at a meeting of the Socialist Party in San Francisco
"when challenged by various members concerning his emphasis on the
yellow peril": "What the devil! I am first of all a white man and only
then a Socialist!"38 Herrenvolk socialism existed no less than
Herrenvolk liberalism.

#### Their indicts of liberalism don't apply -- they assume an ideal-theory liberalism. Our non-ideal theory of liberalism corrects for its failure to account for oppressed people

Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University

Note: this is from one of the sections where Mills lays out potential
critiques of his argument and answers them

2\. Liberalism Cannot Recognize Groups and Group Oppression in Its
Ontology---I (Macro) The second point needs to be logically
distinguished from the first, since a theory could acknowledge the
social shaping of individuals while denying that group oppression is
central to that shaping. (So #1 is necessary, but not sufficient, for
#2.) The Marxist critique, of course, was supposed to encapsulate both
points: people were shaped by society and society (post-"primitive
communism") was class dominated. The ontology was social and it was an
ontology of class. [Today radicals would demand]{.underline} a richer
ontology that can accommodate the realities of gender and racial
oppression also. But whatever candidates are put forward, [the key claim
is that a liberal framework cannot accommodate an ontology of groups in
relations of domination and subordination]{.underline}. To the extent
that liberalism recognizes social groups, these are basically conceived
of as voluntary associations that one chooses to join or not join, which
is obviously very different from, say, class, race, and gender
memberships. [But this evasive ontology, which obfuscates]{.underline}
the most central and obvious fact about [all societies]{.underline}
since humanity exited the hunting-and gathering stage---that is, that
they [are characterized by oppressions of one kind or another---is not a
definitional constituent of liberalism.]{.underline} Liberalism has
certainly recognized some kinds of oppression: the absolutism it opposed
from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, the Nazism and Stalinism
it opposed in the twentieth century. [Liberalism's failure to
systematically address structural oppression in supposedly
liberal-democratic societies is a contingent artifact of the group
perspectives and group interests privileged by those structures, not an
intrinsic feature of liberalism's conceptual apparatus]{.underline}. In
the preface to her recent Analyzing Oppression, Ann Cudd makes a
striking point: that hers is the first book-length treatment of the
subject in the analytic tradition.8 Philosophy, the discipline whose
special mandate it is to illuminate justice and injustice for us, has
had very little to say about injustice and oppression because of the
social background of the majority of its thinkers. [In political theory
and political philosophy, the theorists who developed the dominant
varieties of liberalism have come overwhelmingly from the hegemonic
groups of the liberal social order (bourgeois white males).]{.underline}
So it is really not surprising that, given this background, their
socio-political and epistemic standpoint has tended to reproduce rather
than challenge group privilege Consider Rawls, famously weak on gender
and with next to nothing to say about race. Rawlsian "ideal theory,"
which has dominated mainstream political philosophy for the last four
decades, marginalizes such concerns not contingently but structurally.
[If your focus from the start is principles of distributive justice for
a "well-ordered society," then social oppression cannot be part of the
picture, since by definition an oppressive society is not a well-ordered
one]{.underline}. As Cudd points out, A Theory of Justice "leaves
injustice virtually untheorized," operating on the assumption "that
injustice is merely the negation of justice."9 [But radically unjust
societies---those characterized by major rather than minor deviations
from ideality---will be different from just societies not merely morally
but also metaphysically]{.underline}. What Cudd calls "nonvoluntary
social groups" will be central to their makeup. Accordingly, Cudd
contends that [a conceptualization of "nonvoluntary social groups" must
be central to any adequate account of social oppression: "without
positing social groups as causally efficacious entities, we cannot
explain oppression]{.underline}." Contra the conventional wisdom in
radical circles, however, she is insistent that [the ontology of such
groups can be explained "\[using\] c]{.underline}urrent social science,
in the form of cognitive psychology and modern economic theory, and
situat\[ing\] itself in [the Anglo-American tradition of liberal
political philosophy.]{.underline}"10 Identifying "intentionalist" and
"structuralist" approaches as the two broad categories of competing
theorizations of social groups, she recommends as the best option a
compatibilist position, holding that [while all action is intentionally
guided, many of the constraints within which we act are socially
determined and beyond the control of the currently acting
individual;]{.underline} to put a slogan on it, [intentions dynamically
interact within social structures]{.underline}... . My theory of
nonvoluntary social groups fits the description of what Philip Pettit
calls "holistic individualism," which means that the [social
regularities associated with nonvoluntary social groups supervene on
intentional states, and at the same time, group membership in these and
voluntary social groups partly constitutes the intentional states of
individuals]{.underline}.11 If Cudd is right, then, such a theorization
can indeed be developed within a liberal framework, using the resources
of analytic social and normative theory. But [such a development of the
theory is not merely permissible but should be seen as mandatory, given
liberalism's nominal commitment to individualism, egalitarianism,
universalism, and meliorism.]{.underline} [These values simply cannot be
achieved unless the obstacles to their realization are identified and
theorized]{.underline}. Social-democratic (left) liberalism, feminist
liberalism, [black liberalism]{.underline} all [historically represent
attempts to take these structural realities into account for the
purposes of rethinking dominant liberalism]{.underline}.12 [They are
attempts to get right, to map accurately, the actual ontology of the
societies for which liberalism is prescribing principles of
justice]{.underline}. What Cudd's book demonstrates is that it is the
ignoring of this ontology of group domination that is the real betrayal
of the liberal project. A well-ordered society will not have
nonvoluntary social groups as part of its ontology. So the path to the
"realistic utopia" Rawls is supposedly outlining would crucially require
normative prescriptions for eliminating such groups. [That no such
guidelines are offered is undeniably an indictment of ideal-theory
liberalism, which is thereby exposed as both epistemologically and
ontologically inadequate]{.underline}. [But that does not rule out a
reconceptualized liberalism, a non-ideal-theory liberalism that,
starting from a different social metaphysic, requires a different
normative strategy for theorizing justice.]{.underline}

**We need to reconceptualize liberalism in light of its racist history
-- this is key to reorient it to antiracist ends**

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "New Left Project Interview with Charles
Mills" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism"
Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

You can see how this line of argument can be adopted and translated for
race. My similar claim would be that [liberal political theory is so
shaped by the history of white domination, both national and global,
that]{.underline}, analogously, [it tacitly takes as its representative
political figure the white (male) subject]{.underline}. The parallel is
not perfect, since male domination/patriarchy already exists at the dawn
of modernity, whereas European domination/white supremacy does not. So
you don't get the same taken-for-grantedness of the rightness of
European rule that you get for male rule---it's more contested. Jennifer
[Pitts's]{.underline} A Turn to Empire, for example, is subtitled The
Rise of Imperial Liberalism in Britain and France,1 and her [point is to
demarcate a transition from an early liberalism with significant
anti-racist and anti-imperialist elements to a later liberalism more
uniformly racist and imperialist]{.underline}. [But the dominant variety
does, of course, eventually become a liberalism that assumes the
superiority of Europe as the global civilization, and the identity of
Europeans as the appropriate agents of the civilizing
process.]{.underline} John Locke invests in African slavery and
justifies aboriginal expropriation; Immanuel Kant turns out to be one of
the pioneering theorists of modern "scientific" racism; Georg Hegel's
World Spirit animates the (very material and non-spiritual) colonial
enterprise; and John Stuart Mill, employee of the British East India
Company, denies the capacity of barbarian races in their "nonage" to
rule themselves. [The way in which contemporary liberalism is still
compromised by race is, in my opinion, in the failure to rethink itself
in the light of this history]{.underline}. [Liberalism needs to be
reconceptualized as ideologically central to the imperial project; both
colonial and imperial domination need to be recognized as political
systems in themselves]{.underline} (so, as with the gender critique, the
boundaries of the polity would be redrawn); [liberalism's official
ontology needs to officially admit races as social
existents]{.underline} (they're already tacitly there); [and above all,
in normative political theory]{.underline} (the distinctive terrain of
political philosophy), [racial justice needs to be placed at center
stage.]{.underline}

#### Non-ideal theory accounts for historic denial of black rights

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

Moreover, [in the specific case of the redress of racial injustice, one
does not even need to appeal to such rights, since the situation of, for
example, blacks in the United States is arguably the result of the
historic and current violation of traditional negative
rights]{.underline} (life, liberty, property), which are supposed to be
the uncontroversial ones in the liberal tradition, as well as the legacy
of such practices as manifest in illicitly accumulated wealth and
opportunities. Here again [the hegemony of Rawlsian "ideal
theory"]{.underline} over the development of the mainstream political
philosophy of the last forty years [has had pernicious consequences,
marginalizing such issues and putting the focus instead on principles of
distributive justice for an ideal "well ordered" society.]{.underline}
But [an emancipatory liberalism would be reoriented from the start
toward non-ideal theory and would correspondingly make rectificatory
justice and the ending of social oppression its priority]{.underline}.31

### Reject Liberalism Bad - Agency

#### Rejecting humanism/liberalism denies agency to the oppressed and is historically incorrect

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

[A commitment to humanism does not, as pointed out above, require the
denial of the obvious fact that human beings---especially the
oppressed---are constrained by material structures and social
restrictions]{.underline} in what they can accomplish, [nor
that,]{.underline} as products of particular epochs and group
memberships, [their consciousness will have been shaped by dominant
concepts and norms.]{.underline} Marx emphasized long ago that [though
people make history, they do not make it under conditions of their own
choosing, that agency is constrained by structure and circumstance.
But,]{.underline} contra Althusser, [this was never intended as a
rejection of the claim that it is still people who ultimately assert
their personhood in struggle.]{.underline} And in my opinion, the retort
applies to the Foucauldian version of the thesis also. To make the
familiar left critiques: [such an analysis not only deprives us of a
normative basis for indicting structures of oppression, not only
deprives the subject of agency, but is flagrantly inconsistent with the
actual history of people's resistance to the systems that have
supposedly "produced" them as subjects]{.underline}. [The anti-colonial
struggle, the anti-Fascist and anti-Stalinist struggles, the civil
rights struggles]{.underline} of white women, people of color, gays,
[the recent "Arab spring" all give the lie to such a diagnosis. Radical
liberalism is capable of recognizing both the extent of our
socialization by the existing oppressive social order and the ways in
which]{.underline}, nonetheless, [many people resist and struggle
against this oppressive social order.]{.underline}

### Black Radical Liberalism Good/Solves

#### Black radical liberalism combines the insights of black Marxism and black nationalism with normative liberal values to articulate an emancipatory project that places an analysis of slavery and white supremacy at its center 

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Epilogue (as Prologue): Toward a Black
Radical Liberalism" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial
Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

Let me outline my proposed candidate. [In taxonomies of African
American/black political thought, the standard contrast would be as in
Figure E.1. Black nationalism, as for example in Kwame Ture]{.underline}
(Stokely Carmichael) [and Charles V. Hamilton's classic Black Power,
sees blacks as oppressed by a white power structure that relies on both
individual and institutional racism]{.underline}.4 [It locates white
oppression in a history of European colonialism and racial slavery and
calls for blacks to organize around racial solidarity to struggle for
liberation f]{.underline}rom the legacy of these colonial structures.
[Black Marxism, whose classic exegesis can be found in Cedric Robinson's
book]{.underline} on the subject, [agrees on the significance of
European colonialism and racial slavery but attempts to situate their
dynamic within a modified Marxist framework]{.underline}.5 So "whites"
as a group need to be disaggregated into classes, and the imperative of
capital accumulation and the role of different class forces within
"races" must be taken into account in explaining the overall trajectory
of the system. [Thus a more complex political picture is involved, for
which struggle against both racial and class domination is required.
What I am arguing for is a synthesizing, reconstructed black liberalism
that draws upon the most valuable insights of the black nationalist and
black Marxist traditions and incorporates them into a dramatically
transformed liberalism]{.underline}. So this section of the taxonomies
would now be drawn differently (Figure E.2). My three central theorists
for this enterprise are Immanuel Kant (idealist and racist liberal),
Karl Marx (materialist but classreductionist \[and racist\] class
theorist), and W. E. B. Du Bois (critical race theorist). This may seem
an unlikely combination until one considers their respective areas of
contribution. Kant is crucial---obviously a Kant purged of the racism I
earlier discussed in chapter 6---as the most important theorist of the
dominant variety of contemporary liberalism, "deontological" liberalism.
Du Bois is obviously the most important theorist of race and blackness.
And [the "radical" reconstructive dynamic by which I hope to transform
liberalism will be supplied by both Du Bois and Marx, in simultaneous
cooperation and contention with each other.]{.underline} Hence [each
member of the trio provides input into a proposed combined synthesis:
black radical liberalism.]{.underline} So how does black radical
liberalism differ from black mainstream liberalism? By definition they
are both "liberal" in endorsing liberalism as a political philosophy.
But [black radical liberalism seeks to transform liberalism to make it
responsive to the realities of the black diasporic experience in
modernity and the correspondingly necessary reordering of liberal
normative priorities.]{.underline} [Black radical liberalism both (a)
recognizes white supremacy as central to the making of the United States
and]{.underline} (more sweepingly) [the modern world, and (b) seeks to
rethink the categories, crucial assumptions, and descriptive and
normative frameworks of liberalism in the light of that
recognition.]{.underline} [Black mainstream liberalism either (a)
refuses to recognize white supremacy]{.underline} (for example, by
endorsing the "anomaly" view of US racism6 ), [or (b) even if it does
give lip service to its reality]{.underline}, assumes nonetheless that
the categories, crucial assumptions, and descriptive and normative
frameworks of liberalism can be adopted with little change to the task
of getting rid of it.

#### Black radical liberalism uses non-ideal theory to account for the shortcomings in white liberalism -- their offense doesn't apply

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Epilogue (as Prologue): Toward a Black
Radical Liberalism" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial
Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

[As we have seen throughout, Rawls famously focuses in A Theory of
Justice on "ideal theory," the normative theory of a perfectly just
society, characterized by "strict compliance" with its principles of
justice.]{.underline} As he acknowledges at the start of the book,
"Obviously the problems of partial compliance theory \[including
"compensatory justice," which I am taking to be corrective justice\] are
the pressing and urgent matters. These are the things that we are faced
with in everyday life."15 [Ideal theory, however, was supposed to be the
necessary preliminary to properly doing non-ideal theory]{.underline}.
[But forty-plus years later, the transition to theorizing "compensatory
justice" has still not been made,]{.underline} and contemporary Rawlsian
discussions of non-ideal theory are dealing with other senses of the
term. Obviously, [for a population historically subordinated in
modernity through slavery, colonialism, and Jim Crow, non-ideal theory
is the imperative]{.underline}. Afro-modern (as it is now called)
political philosophy is centrally shaped by the experience of
oppression, domination, and exploitation.16 So [black radical
liberalism]{.underline} (like feminist liberalism) [is going to be a
variety of non-ideal-theory liberalism, a liberalism concerned with
overcoming group oppression in a nominally liberal society]{.underline}.
Indeed, as discussed in chapter 2, we could think of this as a deep
theoretical distinction in liberal theory that has not received the
attention and formal semantic flagging that it deserves---not merely
that there are ideal-theory and non-ideal-theory approaches to justice
but that liberalism itself should be thought of as coming in
ideal-theory and non-ideal-theory variants. [Many of the problems
standardly attributed by progressives to liberalism as such, liberalism
qua liberalism, are really problems distinctive to ideal-theory
liberalism, a liberalism abstracting away from social oppression. Once
this is recognized, it should immediately be appreciated how different a
non ideal-theory liberalism would have to be, not merely in its approach
to justice but in its radically divergent social ontology and social
epistemology.]{.underline}

More stuff about ideal-theory as the problem, not liberalism in an of
itself, black radical liberalism solves

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Epilogue (as Prologue): Toward a Black
Radical Liberalism" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial
Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

Relatedly, [non-ideal-theory liberalism presupposes the ill-orderedness
of society]{.underline}. [Rawls, as we saw in earlier chapters, directs
us to think of societies as "cooperative ventures for mutual
advantage,"]{.underline} with "well ordered societies" of "strict
compliance" then being a subset of this category.17 So there is a double
idealization involved, bringing home how utterly remote this framework
is from even a glancing acquaintance with any actual human social
system. [But a white supremacist state is not a cooperative venture for
mutual advantage in the first place, let alone a well-ordered
one]{.underline}. To assume the cooperative-venture characterization
would effectively be to rule racist societies out of normative
consideration from the start. So [black radical liberalism rejects such
a stipulation]{.underline}. [Instead, it works with a conception of
society broad enough to include ill-ordered societies]{.underline}.
[Ill-ordered societies are coercive rather than cooperative ventures,
characterized by exploitation and systemic disrespect for subordinated
groups]{.underline} rather than mutual advantage and reciprocal respect.
[Ill-ordered societies are, in other words, the world.]{.underline}
Correspondingly, the social ontology of an ill-ordered oppressive
society is going to be very different from the social ontology of a
well-ordered society. Individuals will be members of dominant and
subordinated groups (sometimes at the same time) and this will shape
them fundamentally. [Races as social constructs will be central social
entities that must be theorized by a socially informed
metaphysics]{.underline}. [Liberal individuals in this non-ideal-theory
liberalism will therefore not be atomistic isolates but raced humans
interacting with each other in racialized ways]{.underline}, with
implications both for their own psychology and for broader cognitive and
affective societal patterns. [The main obstacles to veridical cognition
will, accordingly, not be individually originating bias but
dominant-group ideologies]{.underline} (here "whiteness," "white
ignorance," etc.). The central liberal contractarian value of what Rawls
calls "publicity"---what we would now term "transparency"---will thus
need to be fundamentally reoriented by the challenge of overcoming the
structural opacities of an ill-ordered (here white-supremacist) society.
Racial liberalism---the theme of this book---will have to be exposed for
what it is, especially since contemporary versions (as in Rawlsianism
itself) will generally be able to fly under the radar through no longer
having overt racial identifiers even while continuing to normatively
center whites. [Black radical liberalism will therefore need to be on
the alert for putatively inclusive abstractions that are really
color-coded]{.underline}. In more than one chapter, I have mentioned
Samuel Fleischacker's important book A Short History of Distributive
Justice, whose political implications have not, in my opinion, been
sufficiently appreciated in the profession.18 Fleischacker points out
that universal distributive justice as a norm in the Western tradition
is only slightly more than 200 years old (and of course initially really
just extends over the "universe" of white males). Not even white women
are included, and certainly not people of color in Western societies.19
"[Corrective justice" as a concept is]{.underline} even more
[undeveloped and untheorized, especially where groups are
concerned]{.underline}. ("Rectificatory justice" in Aristotle
presupposes status membership and does not extend to property rights;
"reparations" in Locke are really for individuals.) The unavoidable
implication, it seems to me (even if it has been avoided in the
profession), is that Western normative theory in general historically
for most of 2,500 years, and liberalism for most of modernity, has been
complicit with rather than condemnatory of group subordination. [The
under-theorization in the tradition of corrective justice for
subordinated groups, despite the subordination of most of the population
nominally in the theory's ambit, is itself a manifestation of this
complicity]{.underline}.20 [Contemporary political philosophy's
post-Rawlsian focus on "ideal theory" is thus not aberrant but
completely continuous with this long history of moral
evasion.]{.underline}

#### Black Radical Liberalism starts from the position of dismantling an antiblack structure through corrective justice, non-ideal theory, and redeploying values like egalitarianism strategically -- we solve best

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Epilogue (as Prologue): Toward a Black
Radical Liberalism" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial
Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

[My claim is that this is a better strategy for arriving at principles
of racial justice]{.underline} than trying to derive them from PDJ1 and
PDJ2 (whose moral foundation is not the correction of wrongs). [The
thought experiment]{.underline} (as a "device of representation") [is
being applied to a different end: not how you would create an ideal
basic structure from ground zero but how you would dismantle an already
existing unjust basic structure. In "contractual" terms, we could think
of it as tearing up the "bad" contract that has created the world we
live in.]{.underline} (Cf. Rousseau, who described two contracts, one
non-ideal, one ideal.)24 So the thought-experiment plays itself out
differently. Self-knowledge is still blocked by the veil (so as to
guarantee objectivity). But the veil is thinner on social knowledge. [We
know that we are going to emerge into a society whose basic structure
has historically been shaped by white supremacy]{.underline}. All the
social variants among which we choose will have a white-supremacist
state as their ancestor (since an ideal society is not an option for
us). So [we are making a self-interested choice about different
principles of corrective justice that will correct to a greater or
lesser degree for this history of racial domination, thereby generating
different possible social orders]{.underline}. The choice then becomes
this: What kinds of measures would you select to correct for a history
of racial injustice, worried that when the veil lifts, you may turn out
to be black or a member of some other historically subordinated race?
What recommendations would you make for altering the legal and political
system, the structure of economic opportunities, the dominant cognitive
and evaluative norms, the cultural patterns, the somatic ideal, the
inherited social ontology of racial superiority and inferiority? What
principles would you choose, in sum, to dismantle a racialized basic
structure and a racialized social ontology founded on a racial contract?
Racial injustice and its correction would thus be center stage rather
than offstage altogether, as it is in the Rawlsian literature. [What
might these principles look like?]{.underline} Since we are using
Rawlsian/ Kantian categories (liberties, socio-economic opportunities,
respect) as guides, [one obvious move would be to assume the same
fundamental demarcation Rawls draws between one's identity as a citizen
and one's position in the economy]{.underline}. [However, we also have
to include here the crucial addendum that---unlike with ideal
theory---"respect" as a primary social good cannot be just left to the
workings of the regulatory principles for these two areas, since social
"disrespect" for blacks and other subordinated races is an explicit part
of the original "contract" and, correspondingly, of the basic
structure]{.underline}. [Dismantling that structure, voiding the
contract, requires a separate principle of justice formally targeting
the "expressive harms" of sub-personhood]{.underline}. Thus the critical
role of a deracialized Kantianism now grounded in the black experience
of the denial of equal humanity: Du Bois's reports from behind the color
line. [I propose the following three principles]{.underline} (Figure
E.5). I suggest that the plausibility of these three principles is
confirmed not merely by their correspondence with Rawls's listing
(suitably transmuted for non-ideal conditions) but their resonance with
our own everyday moral sense of the major different dimensions of racial
injustice. [Blacks and other people of color have historically suffered
from (a) unequal (zero or second-class) citizenship, without equal
status in the civic sphere or proportional political input into the
governing process, (b) racial exploitation and economic
marginalization,25 and (c) the "ontological" stigmatization of the group
as inferior lesser beings because of their "racial"
membership]{.underline}. [Principles of corrective justice]{.underline}
will thus have to [target these historic violations of,]{.underline}
respectively, [the basic rights and liberties, the equal opportunities,
and the equal respect that people of color should have received, but did
not, and the illicit racial edge]{.underline}, ∆, [whites have instead
had in each sphere]{.underline}. appropriate corrective principle.
Obviously, I am not denying that the question of what kind of public
policy will in fact be justified by these principles will be a hugely
controversial topic. Recall, for example, the outrage generated years
ago by Lani Guinier's recommendations to overcome a permanent white
majority through cumulative or supermajority voting, or the more recent
debate over the weakening of the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme
Court's 2013 Shelby decision.26 [Consider the effective defeat of
affirmative action policies and the preemptive white rejection of
reparations to African Americans]{.underline}.27 [Think of the recent
heated disputes over the symbolic significance of the redrafting of high
school textbooks to highlight racial oppression]{.underline} (e.g.,
"Raza Studies"), [the flying of the Confederate flag, the use of Native
American images and epithets by sports teams, and the naming of
buildings and institutions at leading universities after racist white
historical figures]{.underline}.28 [But the point is that a Rawlsian
apparatus that is explicitly modified to adjudicate matters of non-ideal
theory and grounded in the imperative of correcting for the legacy of
white supremacy---racially unequal citizenship, racial exploitation, and
racial disrespect---could now be an active and valuable contributor to
these debates and to the undermining of racial liberalism, not simply a
detached spectator or even an actual accomplice to its
perpetuation.]{.underline} Rawlsian political philosophy could at last
become [a real player in the righting of the historic and current white
wrongs to black rights]{.underline}. In future work, I hope to develop
in greater detail this project of articulating a black radical
liberalism that is true both to the (idealized) liberal tradition, the
liberalism that should have been, and respectful of the black diasporic
experience in modernity, victims of the liberalism that actually was and
is.

### A2 BRL Must Use Reform

#### We don't have to defend reform good -- our argument is about the values of liberalism as a rallying point

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

["Liberalism" may denote both a political philosophy and the
institutions and practices characteristically tied to that political
philosophy. My focus will be on the former]{.underline}. [The issue of
how bureaucratic logics may prove refractory to reformist
agendas]{.underline} is undeniably an important one, but it [does not
really fall into the purview]{.underline} of philosophy proper. [My aim
is to challenge the radical shibboleth that radical ideas/concepts/
principles/values are incompatible with liberalism.]{.underline} [Given
the deep entrenchment of this assumption in the worldview of most
radicals, refuting it would still be an accomplishment]{.underline},
even if working out practical details of operationalization are
delegated to other hands.

### A2 Liberalism Bad b/c Individualistic

#### Black radical liberalism accounts for the values of individualism without eschewing a focus on structural oppression -- their offense doesn't apply

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

Note: this is from one of the sections where Mills lays out potential
critiques of his argument and answers them

3\. Liberalism Cannot Recognize Groups and Group Oppression in Its
Ontology---II (Micro) But (it will be replied) liberalism suffers from a
deeper theoretical inadequacy. Even if it may be conceded that liberal
theory can recognize oppression at the macro-level, [it will be argued
that its individualism prevents it from recognizing how]{.underline}
profoundly, [at the micro-level, individuals are shaped by structures of
social oppression. Class, race, and gender belongings penetrate deeply
into the ontology of the individual in ways rendered opaque (it will be
claimed) by liberalism's foundational individualism. But what those
seeking to retrieve liberalism would point out is that we need to
distinguish different senses of "individualism."]{.underline} [The
individualism that is foundational to liberalism]{.underline} is a
normative individualism (as in the Gray quote above), which [makes
individuals rather than social collectivities the locus of value. But
that does not require any denial that individuals are shaped in their
character]{.underline} (the "second nature" famously highlighted by left
theory) [by oppressive social forces and related group
memberships]{.underline}. Once the first two criticisms have been
refuted---that liberal individuals cannot be "social," and that the
involuntary group memberships central to the social in oppressive
societies cannot be accommodated within a liberal framework---then this
third criticism collapses also[. One can without inconsistency affirm
both the value of the individual and the importance of recognizing how
the individual is socially molded, especially when the environing social
structures are oppressive ones.]{.underline} As already noted, [dominant
liberalism tends to ignore or marginalize such constraints, assuming as
its representative figures individuals not merely morally equal, but
socially recognized as morally equal,]{.underline} and equi-powerful
rather than group-differentiated into the privileged and the
subordinated. [But this misleading normative and descriptive picture is
a function of a political agenda complicit with the status quo, not a
necessary implication of liberalism's core assumptions]{.underline}. [A
revisionist, radical liberalism would make the analysis of group
oppression, the denial of equal standing to the majority of the
population, and their impact on the individual's ontology, a theoretical
priority]{.underline}. Thus Cudd's book, after explicating the ontology
of involuntary groups, goes on to detail the various different
ways---through violence, economic constraint, discrimination, group
harassment, and the internalization of psychological oppression---that
[the subordinated are shaped by group domination]{.underline}.13 [But
nothing in her account]{.underline} is meant to [imply either that
they]{.underline} (p.19) [thereby cease to be individuals or that their
involuntary group memberships preclude a normative liberal condemnation
of the injustice of their treatment.]{.underline}

### A2 Liberalism Bad b/c Narrative of Progress

#### We can recognize that the change is possible without committing to a narrative of progress or adhering to notions of universal reason

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

6\. Liberalism's Enlightenment Origins Commit It to Seeing Moral Suasion
and Rational Discourse as the Societal Prime Movers [Liberalism is often
associated with a historical progressivism, but a belief in the
possibility and desirability of meliorism]{.underline} (see Gray)
[certainly does not commit one to Whiggish teleologies]{.underline}.
[One can oppose conservative fatalism and pessimism in its different
versions]{.underline}---Christian claims about original sin, Burkean
distrust of abstract reason, biological determinism in its ever-changing
and ever-renewed incarnations---[without thinking that there is any
inevitability about the triumph of progress and reason]{.underline}. [A
liberalism that is "radical" will necessarily need to draw on the left
tradition's demystified analysis of the centrality of group domination
to the workings of the social order]{.underline}.23 As earlier noted
(sections 2 and 3 above), [a revisionist ontology that recognizes as key
social players nonvoluntary social groups in structural relations of
domination and subordination will perforce have a more realistic view of
the (in)efficacy of moral suasion than an ontology of atomic
individuals. Such a revisionist liberalism will acknowledge the role of
hegemonic ideologies and vested group interests in the preservation of
the status quo]{.underline}, [and their refractoriness to appeals to
reason and justice]{.underline}. Indeed, it will often be precisely in
the names of a "reason" and "justice" shaped by the norms and
perspectives of group privilege---of class, gender, and race---that
egalitarian social change is resisted. As Losurdo makes clear, no
immanent developmentalist moral dynamic drives liberalism's evolution.
[It is not at all the case that an endorsement of democratized liberal
norms implies any corollary belief that the democratic struggle for a
more egalitarian social order is guaranteed to be
successful]{.underline}. [Progress is possible; defeat and rollback are
also possible.]{.underline} In general[, a radical liberalism
should]{.underline}, in some sense[, be "materialist," recognizing the
extent to which both people and the social dynamic are shaped by
material forces and not over-estimating the causal role of rational
argumentation and moral suasion on their own]{.underline}. [Radical
liberalism takes for granted that political and ideological struggle
will be necessary to realize liberal values against the opposition of
those who all too frequently think of themselves as the real
liberals]{.underline}. Radical liberalism can be descriptively realist
(realizing the centrality of interest-based politics) without being
normatively realist (abandoning morality for realpolitik).

### A2 Liberalism Assumes a Neutral State

#### We don't assume the neutrality of the state -- radical liberalism explicitly takes this into account -- we need safeguards, not a rejection of the state/liberalism as a whole

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Occupy Liberalism!" in Black Rights/White
Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University
Press, 2017)

Note: this is from one of the sections where Mills lays out potential
critiques of his argument and answers them

[7. Liberalism Is Naïve in Assuming the Neutrality of the State and the
Juridical System]{.underline} Again, [while such a claim may be true of
dominant varieties of liberalism, it need not be true of
all.]{.underline} (Note that nowhere in Gray's characterization is any
such assumption made.) [The neutrality of the juridico-political system
is a liberal ideal, a norm to be striven for to reflect citizens' equal
moral status before the law and entitlement to equal protection of their
legitimate interests]{.underline}. [To represent it as a sociological
generalization of liberal theory about actual political
systems]{.underline}, including systems self-designated as liberal,
[would be to confuse the normative with the descriptive.]{.underline}
Liberalism has certainly historically had no trouble in seeing the
illicit influence of concentrated group power in the socio-political
systems it opposed (see section #2). The original critique of "feudal"
absolutism, the twentieth century critique of "totalitarianism," relied
in part on the documentation and condemnation of the extent of legally
backed state repression in curbing individual freedom. [Liberalism's
blind spot has been its failure to document and condemn the enormity of
the historic denial of equal rights to the majority of the
population]{.underline} ruled by self styled "liberal" states: the
"absolutism" and "totalitarianism" directed against white women and
white workers, and the nonwhite enslaved and colonized. Patriarchal
democracy, bourgeois democracy, Herrenvolk democracy have all been
represented as "democracy" simpliciter, with no analysis of the
mechanisms of structural subordination that have characterized such
polities, or the ideological sleights-of-hand that have rationalized
them. [But to claim a necessary conceptual connection between such
evasions and liberal assumptions is to confuse the contingent
necessities of the discourse of hegemonic
liberalism]{.underline}---aimed at preserving, whether by justifying or
obfuscating, patriarchal, bourgeois, and racial power---[with what is
taken to be some kind of transworld essence of liberalism.]{.underline}
In recent decades, [a large body of literature has developed that
investigates the impact of class, race, and gender dynamics in the
actual functioning of the state and the legal system]{.underline}.24
[Radical liberalism would draw on this body of literature in seeking to
put in place the safeguards necessary for guaranteeing equal protection
not merely on paper but in reality.]{.underline}

### A2 You're White/Nonblack

#### Nope

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Epilogue (as Prologue): Toward a Black
Radical Liberalism" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial
Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

Finally, some closing words. In keeping with my subtitle---The Critique
of Racial Liberalism---this book has been largely critical, focusing on
what I see as the problems of a racialized liberalism but not offering
much in the way of a positive alternative. That---large---task will have
to await another time and another book. But I did want to add this
epilogue as at least a brief indicator of the line of argument I will be
taking in my attempt to produce a self-consciously anti-racist
liberalism.1 So [I end here with an outline of what I am calling "black
radical liberalism."]{.underline} Two key clarifications are necessary.
To begin with, just as feminist liberalism is not supposed to be a
liberalism only for women but rather a liberalism that all good
liberals, including males, should embrace, so [black radical liberalism
should be welcomed and endorsed by white liberals also]{.underline}.2
[Black radical liberalism is not intended to be a particularistic and
exclusionary political ideology just for blacks, but rather one that
fully adheres to the standard liberal ideals---if more often betrayed
than realized---of universalism and egalitarianism]{.underline}. It
seeks to correct the (anti-universalist, anti-egalitarian) distortions
in mainstream white liberalism, whether de jure or de facto, introduced
by the complicity of that iteration of liberalism with white supremacy,
both nationally and globally. [As such, it should be
accepted]{.underline} (though not uncritically, of course) [by
conscientious white liberals who are presumably also committed to such a
correction, purging, and reconstruction of liberal theory.]{.underline}

### A2 Racial Realism/Bell

#### A2 Racial realism/Derrick Bell -- Black radical liberalism has the best chance to solve this

**Mills in 17** (Charles. "Epilogue (as Prologue): Toward a Black
Radical Liberalism" in Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial
Liberalism" Copyright Oxford University Press, 2017)

[(3) But how can even a "black radical liberalism]{.underline}"
(assuming it doesn't fly apart from centrifugal forces) [deal with the
problems identified by, say, Derrick Bell's "racial
realism?]{.underline} There are no guarantees, but then no other
competing ideology can offer them either. [Insofar as black radical
liberalism is attentive to trends within capitalism]{.underline} (e.g.,
the forthcoming consolidation and exacerbation of plutocracy in the
Western world predicted by Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First
Century),14 [it would hope that an increasing number of the white
poor/white working class may begin to wake up to the reality that the
prospects for their children and grandchildren under plutocratic
capitalism---albeit white-supremacist plutocratic capitalism---are not
that great either]{.underline}. As a materialist political philosophy,
[black radical liberalism does not rest its hopes for social
transformation on moral suasion alone but on the mobilization of group
interests. The strategy would be to combine the racial justice political
project with a larger social justice political project, highlighting the
startling fact that the United States has the most unequal distribution
of income and wealth of all the Western democracies.]{.underline} Of
course, [whites may still prefer to hold on to the "psychological
wage"]{.underline} (Du Bois) [of whiteness]{.underline} if it is going
to be jeopardized by such a transracial political alliance. [But as
emphasized, this will be an obstacle for other anti-racist political
programs also]{.underline}. And the impending demographic shift to a
nonwhite majority should assist. [So that]{.underline} (very sketchily)
[would be the real-world agenda]{.underline}. Let us now look at the
(academic world) implications for political philosophy, particularly
Rawlsian liberalism. Obviously social justice theory does not have to be
done in a Rawlsian framework, but given its centrality to contemporary
Anglo-American political philosophy and to the discussions throughout
this book, it seems natural to end by engaging with Rawlsianism.

#### Fear of criticism and lack of security causes Netanyahu to DOUBLE DOWN on his militarism -- this only increases his popularity and destroys any possibility for a peaceful resolution 

**Scheindlin 18** (Dahlia Scheindlin is a leading international public
opinion analyst and strategic consultant based in Tel Aviv. "Netanyahu
Needs Conflict to Survive," 5/16/18.
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/16/netanyahu-needs-conflict-to-survive/>,
DA: 1/30/19, MT)

In 2015, Benjamin Netanyahu was elected to a fourth term as prime
minister of Israel. Within months, pundits began speculating when his
government would fall. So far, the answer has been never. [Netanyahu has
faced trouble,]{.underline} including ministerial resignations and
police investigations, since shortly after the 2015 elections. Over the
last year, the arguments for his imminent demise gathered steam: In
February, police recommended that the attorney general indict him for
corruption based on investigations in four different cases. [The
situation in the Gaza Strip festered; the Temple Mount nearly exploded;
and the news warned almost nightly of a war with Hezbollah in
Lebanon.]{.underline} [There has been no progress on Israeli-Palestinian
peace since negotiations collapsed in 2014.]{.underline} And at home, a
wave of rage against economic hardship and massive social inequality
erupted in 2011, when Netanyahu was prime minister as well, yet there
has been no relief for the exorbitant cost of living in the seven years
since. Why then is Bibi more beloved than ever? In 2016, [Netanyahu's
Likud party polled at an average of 25.7 seats in the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, lower than the 30 seats it won in 2015 but still ahead of
all rivals. Each year, the average has crept upward]{.underline}. [When
the police recommended indicting Netanyahu, his party's numbers
rose.]{.underline} When U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the
Iran nuclear deal on May 8, polls gave him the highest numbers in a
decade, 35 or 36 seats; one survey was even rumored to predict 42. [As
with so many things in Israel, Netanyahu's solid support is based on
security]{.underline}. In Israel's political discourse, [the word
"security" signifies threats from any form of Palestinian
violence]{.underline}, whether Qassam rocket fire, Palestinian
demonstrations and attempts to cross the Gaza border, or girls wielding
scissors. On Netanyahu's watch, Israel has fought two wars against Hamas
and dealt with a wave of stabbing attacks, along with a crisis on the
Temple Mount and now the deadly escalation in Gaza. [When violence
rises, Israelis vote right.]{.underline} This was the ultimate lesson of
the Second Intifada, which brought a Likud leader back to power in 2001
after a short Labor Party term; the left has never won an election
since. [Netanyahu has mastered the use of crises to shore up his
support]{.underline}. [Periodic escalation reminds nearly half of
Israeli voters that they are relieved to keep the right in
power]{.underline}. [Just one-quarter of Israelis even believe peace is
possible, and at present fewer than half of Israeli Jews support the
two-state solution. The question in their minds is who knows how to
manage a security problem, not who can bring peace.]{.underline} One
Israeli voter recently told me she appreciates Netanyahu for knowing
when to end military escalations. In other words, [not only do many
centrists and right-wingers not blame him for wars; they laud him for
restraint]{.underline}. [Regional threats such as Iran, Hezbollah, and
the Islamic State are also part of the security issue, but they are more
theoretical]{.underline}. Israel has never fought a war with Iran. The
last war with Hezbollah was 12 years ago, and there is no Islamic State
to speak of in Israel. But in the public mind, they loom large,
especially when Netanyahu hammers home the existential threat of Iran at
all opportunities (or broadcasts a campaign ad saying the Israeli left
will bring the Islamic State to Jerusalem). Trump's withdrawal from the
Iran deal was the jewel in Netanyahu's crown. Whether the deal survives
or whether it hinders or helps Iran's presumed quest for military
nuclear capabilities wasn't truly the point. Netanyahu spoke, and a few
days later the most powerful man in the world listened. That's power.
It's also vindication. [For eight years, Netanyahu antagonized President
Barack Obama. Israelis know the United States is Israel's best friend;
Netanyahu's defiant attitude was a risky course not only for
U.S.-Israeli relations but for Netanyahu's homefront, too]{.underline}.
After the 2015 elections, just one-quarter of Israelis thought
U.S.-Israeli relations were good; three quarters rated relations bad or
neutral; and Israeli Jews were split on whether Obama or Netanyahu was
to blame. [Trump's electoral victory set the relationship between the
leaders back on solid ground; colossal policy victories such as pushing
Washington to abandon the Iran deal and moving the U.S. Embassy to
Jerusalem conveyed to voters that Netanyahu was right all
along]{.underline}. He had the grand plan before anyone believed in it.
There was another side of the foreign-policy scheme. In his fourth term,
Netanyahu has made a big show of cultivating other friends beyond the
United States or Europe --- including India and Azerbaijan --- to build
economic ties and enhance the country's regional security interests. The
most important, if cryptic, relationship is with Vladimir Putin's
Russia. It's no accident that Netanyahu met Putin last week between the
two strikes against Iranian targets in Syria or numerous times over the
last two years as Israel has stepped up attacks of the same nature. It's
too simplistic to say Israelis are distracted by terrorism and
escalation away from Netanyahu's corruption cases. Rather, [Netanyahu's
military and diplomatic victories complement and thus burnish his image
in domestic politics]{.underline}. Israelis regularly say, sighing,
"There's nobody else." They mean that on the domestic as well as
international scene. [Very few Israeli coalition governments have
survived for a full term]{.underline}; most collapse and lead to early
elections. Israel has had 34 coalitions in 70 years. By contrast,
Netanyahu's second government from 2009 to 2013 came close to a full
term, and there's no guarantee his current one will fall before 2019 ---
which would be close to another full term. Combined with his staying
power (nearly 13 years combined, the second longest-serving prime
minister), Netanyahu has brought a measure of political stability to
Israel. But there is a price. By the start of his fourth term,
[Netanyahu seemed to have unleashed his true self: a cult of personality
in style and an increasingly consolidated strongman form of governance
in practice.]{.underline} For a time in early 2016, he held five
ministerial portfolios in addition to prime minister, before slowly
parceling them out; he still holds the post of foreign minister. His
government shut down Israel's historic public broadcast authority and
has heaped policy and legal hardships on a new, reconstituted
state-funded news corporation. Meanwhile, Netanyahu enjoys the stalwart
support of the country's highest-circulating newspaper funded by his
patron Sheldon Adelson. [His government is on a warpath against the
Supreme Court and is currently debating a bill that would allow the
Knesset to override the court's right of judicial review]{.underline}.
His government is on a warpath against the Supreme Court and is
currently debating a bill that would allow the Knesset to override the

for the extraction of natural gas, the director of Israel's antitrust
authority and the economy minister resigned in protest]{.underline},
arguing that the arrangement prevented competition and protected a
cartel, citing his direct interference. [Netanyahu made himself economy
minister, which allowed him to activate a special clause to sidestep
antitrust regulations. To do that, he was required to consult with a
Knesset committee by law. The committee members voted against the
clause; he ignored them.]{.underline} [The result of strongman
leadership is that people become much less enthusiastic for the
foundations of democracy, favoring splashy personal achievements or
controversy instead]{.underline}. And the irony of consolidating power
is that it harms democracy but simultaneously generates an environment
in which one person gets credit for everything going well, reinforcing
support for that same leader. Such a leader could also be blamed for all
bad things. But [many Israelis have apparently traded personal economic
frustrations for an occasional celebration, be it Israel's victory in
the Eurovision contest or the U.S. Embassy moving to Jerusalem. Voters
have lowered their standards on personal integrity in return for
domestic tranquility, punctured only by the occasional war that most
believe could not have been prevented. And, so the logic goes, it's
better to have Bibi fighting that war --- or killing those protesters in
Gaza who dare to seek a way out after 11 years of closure --- than a
despised left-winger]{.underline}. Sooner or later, Netanyahu will
eventually exit the political stage. But given the way that every crisis
reinforces his power, and what his years in power have done to Israel,
the pendulum doesn't look likely to swing in the other direction soon.

#### Israeli criticism pushes Netanyahu to turn even more hardline and for American jewish politicians to double down on pro-israel policies 

**Maltz 10/23** (Judy Maltz, writer for Haaretz. "Fed Up With Critics,
Netanyahu Opens Back Channel to Undermine U.S. Reform, Conservative
Leaders," 10/23/18.

[In an effort to resolve the crisis with Reform and Conservative Jews in
the United States, the Israeli government is bypassing the movements'
leaders and reaching out directly to congregational rabbis viewed as
less critical of its policies]{.underline}. Last week, [a delegation of
20 congregational rabbis]{.underline} -- most of them non-Orthodox --
[met with Prime]{.underline} Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu]{.underline}
in Jerusalem to discuss ways of mending relations, which have come under
unprecedented strain in recent years. The mission was organized with the
help of Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, with the
Foreign Ministry covering most of the costs. [Leaders of the Reform and
Conservative movements were not invited or involved in its
planning]{.underline}. [The decision]{.underline} to open new channels
of dialogue with Reform and Conservative rabbis [was prompted by recent
statements from leaders of the movements that annoyed the
government,]{.underline} Haaretz has learned. [One prominent example was
the Reform movement's unenthusiastic response to President Donald
Trump's decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem]{.underline}. "This whole thing came about through a
conversation I had with Dermer," explained Stuart Weinblatt, the senior
rabbi of B'nai Tzedek, a Conservative congregation in Potomac, Maryland.
"I guess [there was some level of frustration with some of the existing
leadership, where channels of communication had not been positive or
constructive]{.underline}. The desire was to try to find means to work
directly with a broad cross section of rabbis from different movements
to discuss and find ways to narrow the gap and try to bridge the rift
between American Jewry and Israel." "I made clear," Weinblatt continued,
"that I wanted people who would be interested in both listening and
speaking, and working in a constructive fashion to be productive and not
just critical." Weinblatt, who also serves as president of the Rabbinic
Cabinet of the Jewish Federations of North America, said that Dermer
planned to hold a follow-up meeting with delegation members "within a
month or so," and that Netanyahu had also expressed interest in
continuing the dialogue. [The most prominent delegation member was
Ammiel Hirsch, the senior rabbi of Manhattan's Stephen Wise Free
Synagogue, who has been outspoken in his criticism of the Reform
movement's current leadership. "Our movement is too narrowly focused on
politics and religious pluralism, and not focused enough on what's going
to make or break our movement in Israel]{.underline}," he said. "All
[the attention is being sucked into narrow political issues -- including
the Kotel,]{.underline}" he said, referring to the impasse between the
government and liberal Jews over an egalitarian prayer space at the
Western Wall. [Rather than issuing statements that question the embassy
move or criticize Israel's military actions in Gaza, Hirsch said, "we
should be rolling up our sleeves and raising millions of dollars so that
we can build institutions and create an authentic and organic movement
in Israel]{.underline}." Other delegation members included Joseph
Potasnik, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis and
senior rabbi at Mount Sinai in Brooklyn, an independent egalitarian
congregation; Jeremy Barras, senior rabbi at Temple Beth Am, a Reform
congregation in Miami; and Yael Splansky, senior rabbi at Holy Blossom,
a Reform congregation in Toronto. The delegation participants spent four
days in Israel. In addition to meeting Netanyahu, they also held
discussions with Michael Oren, a deputy minister in the Prime Minister's
Office, and with opposition leader Tzipi Livni.

I guess it's a sign of desperation. [Interest in Israel among young Jews
is way down]{.underline}. And among the community at large, only 23
percent of Jewish voters list Israel as among their top three
considerations when deciding for whom to vote. (A mere 6 percent say
Israel is the No. 1 factor in casting their votes). The election of
Donald Trump only accelerated the decline in interest in Israel. Jews
overwhelmingly opposed Trump in the November 2016 election. That
opposition has only intensified as anti-Semitism has seriously spiked
since his inauguration. It's lost on no one that the chant of the racist
demonstrators at the violent "alt-right" riot in Charlottesville was,
"The Jews will not replace us." All in all, these are scary times for
Jews right here at home. As for Israel, American Jewish discomfort with
the occupation and Netanyahu's policies in general, combined with fears
about developments in our own country, have moved it far from the center
of Jewish concerns. Simply put, we have more immediate threats to worry
about. Accordingly, it appears that [it's time for the Israel
lobby]{.underline} (led by AIPAC but consisting of all the Jewish
mainstream organizations) [to scare Jews into worrying about
anti-Semitism. But not the anti-Semitism of the "alt-right" and the more
extreme Trump supporters but the supposed anti-Semitism of critics of
Israel]{.underline}. ([They know that progressive critics of Israel's
behavior are safer targets than the real anti-Semites of the right, who
are dangerously close to the Trump administration]{.underline}). In a
previous piece on HuffPost, I wrote about the [bipartisan congressional
effort to criminalize those who choose to boycott Israel to protest the
occupation.]{.underline} In fact, [fighting the boycott effort led by
the BDS]{.underline} (boycott, divestment and sanctions) [movement is
AIPAC's highest priority,]{.underline} right after securing Israel's
multi-billion dollar aid package, which actually passes with no
opposition, anyway. In any case, a new front has been opened in the
battle to use fear of anti-semitism to scare Jews into supporting
Israel, and it is absolutely astounding. Earlier this week[, the House
Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act,
which would, if violated, withhold federal financial assistance to
colleges and universities which tolerate criticism of
Israel]{.underline}. The bill (which has already passed the Senate)
offers no new protections to Jews per se who are protected under
existing civil rights laws. Or, putting it simply, criticizing Israel.
After all, [criticism of Israel is routinely labelled as
delegitimization, demonization and "holding Israel to a double standard"
by Israel's right-wing supporters on pretty much every
campus]{.underline} in the United States already. If this bill passed
progressive organizations, Palestinian student groups or anti-occupation
Jewish organizations like J Street or If Not Now could be shut down on
the grounds that their presence put the university in danger of losing
federal funding. This is ~~crazy~~ stuff. Nonetheless the House
Judiciary Committee held its hearing on it this week at which major
Jewish organizations testified in its support (J Street issued a
statement in strong opposition). And again, the bill has already passed
the Senate. My guess is that it will pass the House too; after all, the
lobby rarely loses its carefully chosen battles. And then the fight will
begin. Some professor will say that, in his opinion, the State of
Israel's creation was a mistake. Or a student group (Students for
Palestine or J Street) will set up an exhibit portraying the occupation
of Hebron or the blockade of Gaza. Or a progressive organization will
call for the evolution of Israel into a single state with equal rights
for all its people. One of the "pro-Israel" organizations will file suit
and suddenly a university will be fighting to maintain the federal
funding it needs for research or scholarships. Or it can just shut down
the "troublemakers." It's not hard to imagine which course they will
choose.

#### Link - The aff's binding of settler colonialism experienced by Palestinians to anti-Black violence is a ruse of analogy that mystifies Black social death. This highlights the contingent focus of the 1AC along with their affirmation of the resolutional question instead of refusing the terms of the debate.

**[I was living in Minneapolis, doing work around the First Palestinian
Intifada (1988--89). I was sitting on a grassy knoll trying to console a
Palestinian friend of mine whose cousin had blown himself up
(accidentally) while making a bomb in the West Bank. My friend was
speaking openly and without his internal censors at work, which was
fine---he was grieving. At one point, he said that it was really
shameful and humiliating the way Israeli men ran their hands over your
body when they stop you at a checkpoint. Then he said that the deepest
sense of humiliation was felt when the Israeli soldier was an Ethiopian
Jew.]{.underline}** Needless to say, this tidbit of information gave me
pause. I didn't know what to make of this. I was pleased that he felt so
comfortable with me that he could speak openly and honestly, but **[I
was also deeply hurt at the thought that my place in the collective
unconscious of Arabs was the same location of general dishonor
(Patterson) that I occupied in the collective unconscious of White
Americans]{.underline}**. **[I gathered enough wits about me to inform
him that that was odd, seeing as how the Palestinians were at war with
Israelis, and White Israelis at that! How was it that people who stole
his land and slaughtered his relatives were somehow less of a threat
than the speaking implements (the Black Jews) White Israelis got to do
their dirty work]{.underline}**? **[What was it about Blacks that made
us so fungible]{.underline}** (Hartman 1997) **[we could be tossed like
salad in the minds of oppressors and of the oppressed who were not
Black? I was faced with the realization that, in the collective
unconscious, the Palestinian insurgent has more in common with Israeli
state and civil society than s/he does with Black people. What they
share is a largely unconscious consensus that Blackness is a locus of
abjection]{.underline}** (Marriott 2000, 2007) to be instrumentalized on
a whim. At one moment Blackness is a disfigured and disfiguring phobic
phenomenon; at another moment Blackness is a sentient implement to be
joyously deployed for reasons and agendas that have little to do with
Black liberation (Marriott 2000). **[There I sat, yearning, in
solidarity with my Palestinian friend's yearning, for the full
restoration of Palestinian sovereignty]{.underline}**; **[mourning, in
solidarity]{.underline}** with my friend's mourning, over the loss of
his insurgent cousin; yearning, that is, for the historical and
political redemption of what I thought was a violated Commons to which
we both belonged---**[when, all of a sudden, my friend reached down into
the libidinal economy of his subjective coherence and the coherence of
his people and slapped me upside the head with a wet gym
shoe]{.underline}**: the startling realization that not only was I
barred, ab initio, from the denouement of redemption, but that the
borders of redemption are policed by Whites and non-Whites alike. **[I
realize, now, that it's worse than that. I, as Black
person]{.underline}** (if person, subject, being are terms we can use)
**[am both barred from the denouement of redemption and, simultaneously,
needed if redemption is to attain any form of coherence. Without the
articulation of a common negrophobogenesis, shared by both Israeli and
Palestinian, the narrative coherence of their bloody conflict would
evaporate.]{.underline}** My friend's, and his country's women's and
men's negrophobogenesis, is the bedrock, the concrete slabs upon which
any edifice of Human articulation (whether love or war) is built. If the
disciplines which comprise the Humanities are to rid themselves of the
parasitism that they heretofore have had in common with radical and
progressive movements on the Left, that is, if our disciplinary labors
are to face, rather than disavow, the discrepancy between Humans who
suffer through an \"economy of disposability\" (Sexton 2015) and Blacks
who suffer by way of \"social death\" (Patterson 1982), then **[we must
come to grips with how the redemption of the subaltern (a narrative, for
example, of Palestinian plenitude, loss, and restoration) is made
possible by the (re)instantiation of a regime of violence that bars
Black people from the imaginary of redemption.]{.underline}** (How this
affects Black daily life is explored in two videos:
\"Reparations...Now,\" <https://vimeo.com/73991006>, and \"Re-Imagining
the Black Body: Race, Memory, and the Excavation of Freedom Now,\"
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFo-GNfyD9g>.)

#### Impact - Black people do not suffer from policy brutality or from the arms trade. Black suffering is foundational to the psyhic health of humanity. The affirmative results in a world where we believe we've abolished the so-called prison regime, but leaves untouched those very psychic investments that make black death possible. Turns and outweighs case.

\"Law Abiding\" is predicated on the absence of reciprocity, utility,
and contingency that Simon Ortiz's poem takes for granted. Absence of
humanity. In fact, **[the poem suggests that a family of murdering,
inanimate bullets could have its grief and loss processed as grief and
loss more readily than the family of a Black murder
victim]{.underline}**. \"Law Abiding\" doesn't assume that the
touchstones of cohesion which make filiation legible will or can be
extended to Blacks. **[There is---in this poem---no mutual futurity into
which Blacks and others will find themselves. The future belongs to the
bullet. Filiation belongs to the bullet. Our caring energies will be
reserved not for the Black but for the bullet]{.underline}**.
**[Reciprocity is not a constituent element of the struggle between
beings who are socially dead and those who are socially alive---the
struggle between Blacks and the world]{.underline}**. **[We need to
apprehend the profound and irreconcilable difference between White
supremacy (the colonial utility of the Sand Creek massacre) and
anti-Blackness (the human race's necessity for violence against Black
people).]{.underline}** **[The antagonism between the postcolonial
subject and the settler (the Sand Creek massacre, or the Palestinian
Nakba) cannot---and should not---be analogized with the violence of
social death]{.underline}**: that is the violence of slavery, which did
not end in 1865 for the simple reason that slavery did not end in 1865.
Slavery is a relational dynamic---not an event and certainly not a place
in space like the South; just as colonialism is a relational
dynamic---and that relational dynamic can continue to exist once the
settler has left or ceded governmental power. And these two relations
are secured by radically different structures of violence.
**[Afro-Pessimism offers an analytic lens that labors as a corrective to
Humanist assumptive logic. It provides a theoretical apparatus that
allows Black people to not have to be burdened by the ruse of
analogy---because analogy mystifies, rather than clarifies, Black
suffering. Analogy mystifies Black peoples' relationship to other people
of color]{.underline}**. Afro-Pessimism labors to throw this
mystification into relief---without fear of the faults and fissures that
are revealed in the process. Let me state the proposition differently:
**[Human Life is dependent on Black death for its existence and for its
conceptual coherence. There is no World without Blacks, yet there are no
Blacks who are in the World. The Black is indeed a sentient being, but
the hobble of Humanist thought is a constitutive disavowal of Blackness
as social death, a disavowal that theorizes the Black as degraded human
entity (i.e., as an oppressed worker, a vanquished postcolonial
subaltern, or a non-Black woman suffering under the disciplinary regime
of patriarchy).]{.underline}** The Black is not a sentient being whose
narrative progression has been circumscribed by racism, colonialism, or
even slavery for that matter. Blackness and Slaveness are inextricably
bound in such a way that whereas Slaveness can be disimbricated from
Blackness, Blackness cannot exist as other than Slaveness.

#### Alt - Only a refusal to create a distance from the pathology of blackness, to work inside of it can produce the end of the world, and therefore sociality. 

**Sexton 10** (Jared Sexton, Director, African American Studies School
of Humanities , Associate Professor, African American Studies School of
Humanities, Associate Professor, Film & Media Studies School of
Humanities at University of California Irvine, "The Social Life of
Social Death: On Afro-Pessimism and Black Optimism")

What I find most intriguing about the timbre of the argument of "The
Case of Blackness," and the black optimism it articulates against a
certain construal of afro-pessimism, is the way that [[it works away
from a discourse of black pathology only to swerve right back into it as
an ascription to those found to be taking up and holding themselves in
"the stance of the pathologist" in relation to black
folks]{.underline}]{.mark}. I say this not only because there is, in
this version of events, a recourse to psychoanalytic terminology
("fetishization," "obsession," "repetition,"), but also because [there
is at the heart of the matter a rhetorical question that
establishes]{.underline} both the bad advice of a wild analysis and [a
tacit diagnosis affording a certain speaker's benefit: "So why is it
repressed?" The "it" that has been afflicted by the psychopathology of
obsessional neurosis is the understanding, which is also to say the
celebration, of the ontological priority or previousness of blackness
relative to the antiblackness that establishes itself against it, a
priority or previousness that is also termed "knowledge of
freedom]{.underline}" or, pace Chandler, comprehension of "the
constitutive force of the African American subject(s)" (Chandler 2000:
261). \[21[\] [What does not occur here is a consideration of the
possibility that something might be unfolding in the project or
projections of afro-pessimism "knowing full well the danger of a kind of
negative reification" associated with its analytical claims to the
paradigmatic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Moten 2004: 279). That is to say,
**[it might just be the case that an object lesson in the phenomenology
of the thing is a gratuity that folds a new encounter into older habits
of thought through a reinscription of (black) pathology that reassigns
its cause and relocates its source without ever really getting inside
it]{.underline}**. In a way, [what we're talking about
relates]{.underline} not to a disagreement about "unthought positions"
(and their de-formation) but [to a disagreement, or discrepancy, about
"unthought dispositions]{.underline}" (and their in-formation). I would
maintain this insofar as [the misrecognition at work]{.underline} in the
reading of that motley crew listed in the ninth footnote
[regards]{.underline}, perhaps ironically, [the performative dimension
or signifying aspect of a "generalized impropriety" so improper as to
appear as the same old propriety returning through the back
door]{.underline}. Without sufficient consideration of the gap between
statement and enunciation here, to say nothing of quaint notions like
context or audience or historical conjuncture, the discourse of
afro-pessimism, even as it approaches otherwise important questions, can
only seem like a "tragically neurotic" instance of "certain discourse on
the relation between blackness and death" (Moten 2007: 9).xiii Fanon and
his interlocutors, or what appear rather as his fateful adherents, would
seem to have a problem embracing black social life because they never
really come to believe in it, because they cannot acknowledge the social
life from which they speak and of which they speak---as negation and
impossibility---as their own (Moten 2008: 192). Another way of putting
this might be to say that they are caught in a performative
contradiction enabled by disavowal. I wonder, however, whether things
are even this clear in Fanon and the readings his writing might
facilitate. Lewis Gordon's sustained engagement finds Fanon situated in
an ethical stance grounded in the affirmation of blackness in the
historic antiblack world. In a response to the discourse of
multiracialism emergent in the late twentieth-century United States, for
instance, Gordon writes, following Fanon, that "there is no way to
reject the thesis that there is something wrong with being black beyond
the willingness to 'be' black -- in terms of convenient fads of playing
blackness, but in paying the costs of antiblackness on a global scale.
Against the raceless credo, then, racism cannot be rejected without a
dialectic in which humanity experiences a blackened world" (Gordon 1997:
67). What is this willingness to 'be' black, of choosing to be black
affirmatively rather than reluctantly, that Gordon finds as the key
ethical moment in Fanon? \[23\] Elsewhere, in a discussion of Du Bois on
the study of black folk, Gordon restates an existential phenomenological
conception of the antiblack world developed across his first several
books: "Blacks here suffer the phobogenic reality posed by the spirit of
racial seriousness. In effect, they more than symbolize or signify
various social pathologies---they become them. In our antiblack world,
blacks are pathology" (Gordon 2000: 87). [[This conception would seem to
support Moten's contention that even much radical black studies
scholarship sustains the association of blackness with a certain sense
of decay and thereby fortifies and extends the interlocutory life of
widely accepted political common sense.]{.mark} In fact, it would seem
that Gordon deepens the already problematic association to the level of
identity. [And yet, this is precisely what Gordon argues is the value
and insight of Fanon: he fully accepts the definition of himself as
pathological as it is imposed by a world that knows itself through that
imposition, rather than remaining in a reactive stance that insists on
the]{.mark}]{.underline} (temporal, moral, etc.) [[heterogeneity between
a self and an imago originating in culture.]{.mark} [Though it may
appear counterintuitive, or rather because it is counterintuitive, this
acceptance or affirmation is active; it is a willing or willingness, in
other words, to pay whatever social costs accrue to being black, to
inhabiting blackness, to living a black social life under the shadow of
social death. This is not an accommodation to the dictates of the
antiblack world. **The affirmation of blackness, which is to say an
affirmation of pathological being, is a refusal to distance oneself from
blackness in a valorization of minor differences that bring one closer
to health, to life, or to sociality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fanon writes
in the first chapter of Black Skin, White Masks, "The Black Man and
Language": "A Senegalese who learns Creole to pass for Antillean is a
case of alienation. The Antilleans who make a mockery out of him are
lacking in judgment" (Fanon 2008: 21). In a world structured by the twin
axioms of white superiority and black inferiority, of white existence
and black nonexistence, a world structured by a negative categorical
imperative---"above all, don't be black" (Gordon 1997: 63)---in this
world, the zero degree of transformation is the turn toward blackness, a
turn toward the shame, as it were, that "resides in the idea that 'I am
thought of as less than human'" (Nyong'o 2002: 389).xiv [In this we
might create a transvaluation of pathology itself, something like an
embrace of pathology without pathos]{.underline}.

### Social Death Theory Good 

#### We must theorize slavery as maximum captivity in order to produce a structural analysis capable to think of the resistance necessary to disrupt that system.

\[4\] The reticence expressed about the force and signification of
Afro-Pessimism, which in some quarters has bloomed into open if largely
uninformed resistance, has taken on the logic of preemptive strike.
Though we have little engagement in print thus far, due in part to the
recentness of the published literature, certain discussions are
nonetheless afoot on the left \"devoted to blaming pessimism for

**[[Afro-Pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in this case and on this
count, **[[is thought to be]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in no particular
order: **[a negative appraisal of the capabilities of black peoples,
[associating blackness with lack]{.mark}]{.underline}** rather than
tracing the machinations through which the association is drawn and
enforced, even in the black psyche, across the [longue
durée]{.underline}; a myopic denial of overlapping and ongoing histories
of struggle and a fatal misunderstanding of the operational dynamics of
power, its general economy or micro-physics, reifying what should be
historicized en route to analysis; **[a retrograde and isolationist
[nationalism,]{.mark} a [masculinist and heteronormative]{.mark}
enterprise, a destructive and sectarian ultra-leftism, and a chauvinist
American exceptionalism; a [reductive]{.mark} and morbid fixation on the
depredations of slavery that superimposes the figure of the slave as an
anachronism onto ostensibly post-slavery societies, and so
on]{.underline}**. \[5[**\]** **[The]{.mark} last [assertion,]{.mark}

burden of proof of abolition and,]{.mark} moreover, [fails to
acknowledge that one can account for historically varying instances of
anti-blackness while maintaining the claim that slavery is here and
now]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Most telling though is the leitmotif of
[offense]{.underline}**,** and the felt need among critics to defend
themselves, their work, their principles and their politics against the
perceived threat. In place of thoughtful commentary, we have distancing
and disavowal. The grand pronouncement is offered, generally, without
the impediment of sustained reading or attempted dialogue, let alone
careful study of the relevant literature. The entire undertaking, the
[movement]{.underline} of thought it pursues, is apprehended instead as
its lowest common denominator, indicted by proxy, and tried [in
absentia]{.underline} as
caricature.[^\[1\]^](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-1)
\[6\] **[Astonishingly, all of this refuses to countenance the
rhetorical dimensions of the discourse of Afro-Pessimism]{.underline}**
(despite the minor detail that its principal author is a noted creative
writer and its first major statement is found in an award-winning
literary work of memoir) [**and the productive theoretical effects of
the fiction it creates, namely, a meditation on a poetics and politics
of abjection wherein racial blackness operates as an asymptotic
approximation of that which disturbs every claim or formation of
identity and difference as
such.[^\[2\]^](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-2)**
**Afro-Pessimism is thus not against the politics of coalition simply
because coalitions tend systematically to render supposed common
interests as the concealed particular interests of the most powerful and
privileged elements of the alliance.**]{.underline} **[Foremost,
[Afro-Pessimism]{.mark} it [seeks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in
Wilderson\'s parlance, [[**\"to shit on the inspiration of the personal
pronoun** we]{.underline}]{.mark}\" (143) **[[because coalitions require
a logic of identity and difference, of collective selves modeled on the
construct of the modern individual]{.mark}, an entity whose coherence is
purchased at the expense of whatever is cast off by
definition]{.underline}**. The subject of politics is essentially
individual and there is in effect always another intervention to be made
on behalf of some aspect of the group excluded in the name of the
proper.[^\[3\]^](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-3)
The ever-expansive inclusionary gesture must thus be displaced by
another more radical approach: an ethics of the real, a politics of the
imperative, engaged in its interminably downward movement. This daunting
task entails making necessity out of virtue, as it were, willing the
[need]{.underline} for the black radical imagination and not just its
revisable demand. [**If certain scholars whose work has been instructive
or inspirational for Afro-Pessimism miss this point too, it may have
something to do with the search for [a method of gaining agency]{.mark}
that, while rightly suspending the assumption of an** a priori **agent,
nonetheless rushes [past the hidden structure of violence that
underwrites so many violent acts, whether spectacular or
mundane]{.mark}.**]{.underline} \[7\] Such may provide reassurance for
those informed by the basic assumptions and animated by the [esprit de
corps]{.underline} of the theoretical orientations and conceptual frames
in question, but it cannot be mistaken for an adequate defense of a
disposition. We would do well, on this score, to heed Joshua Dienstag\'s
rather germane suggestion in [Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic,
Spirit]{.underline} that \"some thought should be given to why this word
functions so well as a gesture of dismissal\" and, likewise, to \"the
routine use of \'pessimist\' and its cognates as a casual intellectual
put-down\" (Dienstag 2006: x). For present purposes, Afro-Pessimism as
epithet would be the obverse of the unasked question: [Why has this
discourse found its articulation now?]{.underline} Rather than simply
motivating speculation about the psychological states and political
commitments of theorists, commentators, students, advocates or
adherents; the intervention and implications of Afro-Pessimism, however
they are adjudged, \"need to be addressed at the theoretical level at
which they arose\" (Dienstag 2001: 924). Dienstag writes further:
Critics have often mistaken a depiction of the world for a
[choice]{.underline} about our future, as if \[scholars\] had rejoiced
at the decline or decay they described. \[\...\] Yet, despite the abuse
they attract pessimists keep appearing---and this should not be
surprising since the world keeps delivering bad news. Instead of blaming
pessimism, perhaps, we can learn from it. Rather than hiding from the
ugliness of the world, perhaps we can discover how best to withstand it
(Dienstag 2006:
x).[^\[4\]^](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-4)
\[8\] [As if]{.underline} they rejoiced about the wrong things and, by
contrast, failed to rejoice about the right ones. Why not turn this
(moralistic) accusation into (political-intellectual) opportunity?
Indeed, the moniker \"Afro-Pessimism\" emerges at a certain inaugural
moment as the embrace of a critical outlook deemed, upon review, to be
disappointing or discouraging to an ostensibly progressive, even
modernist anti-racism (Hartman 2003). [Détournement]{.underline}.
Resignification. A simple enough term for withstanding the ugliness of
the world---and learning from it---might be [suffering]{.underline} and
**[Afro-Pessimism is, among other things, an attempt to formulate an
account of such suffering, to establish the rules of its grammar, \"to
think again about the position of the ex-slave,\"]{.underline}** as
Bryan Wagner puts it in his [Disturbing the Peace]{.underline}**,**
\"without recourse to the consolation of transcendence\" (Wagner 2009:
2). The difficulty has to do with the special force that the consolation
of transcendence---be it cultural, economic, geographical, historical,
political, psychological, sexual, social or symbolic---brings to bear on
the activity of thinking, no less of speaking and writing, about those
whose transcendence is foreclosed in and for the modern world.

[Regarding the Black position, some might ask why, after claims

answer these questions by demonstrating how nothing remotely approaching

en masse at the polls still constitute the lived experience of Black

be the very rubric that I am calling into question]{.mark}: the grammar
of suffering known as exploitation and alienation, the assumptive logic
whereby subjective dispossession is arrived at in the calculations
between those who sell labor power and those who acquire it. [The Black
qua the worker]{.mark}.]{.underline} Orlando Patterson has already
dispelled this faulty ontological grammar in *Slavery and Social Death,*
where he demonstrates how and why work, or forced labor, is not a
constituent element of slavery. [Once the \"solid\" plank of \"work\" is
removed from slavery, then the conceptually coherent notion of \"claims
against the state\"---the proposition that the state and civil society
are elastic enough to even contemplate the possibility of an
emancipatory project for the Black position---disintegrates into thin
air. The imaginary of the state and civil society is parasitic on the
Middle Passage. Put another way, **[No slave, no
world]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And, in addition, as Patterson argues, no
slave is *in* the world. If, as an ontological position, that is, as a
grammar of suffering, the Slave is not a laborer but an anti-Human, a
position against which Humanity establishes, maintains, and renews its
coherence, its corporeal integrity; if [the Slave is]{.underline}, to
borrow from Patterson, [generally dishonored, perpetually open to
gratuitous violence, and void of kinship structure]{.underline}, that
is, having no relations that need be recognized, a being outside of
re-lationality, then [**[our analysis cannot be approached through the
rubric of gains or reversals in struggles with the state and civil
society, not unless and until the interlocutor first explains how the
Slave is of the world. The onus is not on one who posits the
Master/Slave dichotomy but on the one who argues there is a distinction
between Slaveness and Blackness]{.underline}**.]{.mark} How, when, and
where did such a split occur? The woman at the gates of Columbia

#### Turn. Don't need to win CAPITAL T TRUTH. Afropessimism is a STRATEGIC WAY OF READING HISTORY embedded within MULTIPLE FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE. GORDON IS WRONG. We do not lock out the possibility of black agency, THE WORLD DOES. 

#### [Brady]{.underline} (Nick, PhD candidate at UC Irvine) [2015]{.underline} (A Few Notes on the Intramural of Afropessimism, <https://outofnowhereblog.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/a-few-notes-to-the-intramural-on-afropessimism/>, C.A.) I once was told in a conversation, "I just don't buy that black people are socially dead." In another situation, a friend of mine was asked a similar question centered about belief. [[The bottom line seems to come down to whether or not you "buy" that social death is real, whether it has capital "T" truth behind it. Is the sky is blue? Can black people be socially dead?]{.underline} In]{.mark} certain people's attitudes social death seems to have the intellectual weight of Dragons and Unicorns. Somewhere behind these conversations Jay Z raps "We don't believe you, you need more people." [Such engagement]{.underline}, while understandable at a certain level, [can be put in the same intellectual trash bin as "I'm black and I have seen reverse racism" or "Work is not exploitative, I like my work."]{.underline} All can be true at the level of one's perception, while [one's personal feelings do not necessarily translate into an accurate or even desirable political analysis]{.underline}. [[Theories of social death, political ontology, and libidinal economy are concepts produced in a political analysis of many different fields]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as race and psychoanalysis, the forever growing historical literature on slavery and capitalism, the black radical tradition, black feminist and black queer interventions into theory and politics, etc. This is to say, [it is making an argument and [one must engage the actual substance of the argument]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a writer, I employ concepts such as social death, political ontology, and libidinal economy as critical terms of study. [[These concepts enable]{.underline}]{.mark} me to do both political and intellectual [[work that speaks directly to the pervasive nature of black suffering across time and space]{.underline}.]{.mark} They are not the only concepts nor are they original, the novelty lies in how the concept allows certain work to be done. So [[when one says thinking of race as ontology destroys our agency and destroys the possibility of possibility itself, locking us into a self-defeating logic]{.underline},]{.mark} I always wonder what they mean. Do they mean the theory of social death or political ontology has a material history that has locked us out of possibility? [[The obvious answer to this is, the theory did not do that, the world did that and the theory describes the violence of the world.]{.mark}]{.underline} 

#### Turn. Black existentialism relies on a false notion of a universal capacity to turn nothing into a productive something. This is only possible for humans based upon the terror projected onto black bodies. Proves freedom of immigrant and savage reproduces the BLACK BORDER.

#### SLAYER CARDS

Warren 18

**[[Postmetaphysics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in contrast, **[[attempts
the surmounting or twisting]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[verwunden\] **[[of
the ground and logic of metaphysics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It insists
that metaphysics reproduces pain and misery and restricts human freedom.
Representing the human as an object of scientific thinking (e.g.,
biology, economics, law) destroys the spontaneity and uniqueness of the
human--- things that make the human special. **The ground**, then, upon
which metaphysics relies is problematic, and this ground must be
destroyed (i.e., twisted) and deconstructed (i.e., displaced) to free
the human. **[Postmetaphysics would advocate for a self-consumption of
this ground through hermeneutical strategies, unending deconstructions,
and forms of plurality]{.underline}** (such as hermeneutic nihilism).
The post is rather a misnomer, if we think of post as an overcoming
\[Überwunden\]; the postmetaphysician will never overcome metaphysics.
**[A residue will always remain, but the postmetaphysician hopes to
reduce this metaphysical residue to render it
inoperative]{.underline}**. The postmetaphysician understands
antiblackness as a problem of metaphysics, especially the way scientific
thinking has classified being along racial difference and biology. The
task of the postmetaphysical project is to free blacks from the misery
metaphysics produces by undermining its ground. Hermeneutical
strategies, which contest ultimate foundations, would question the
ground of race (racial metaphysics) and its claim to universal truth.
[**[Black humanism and postmetaphysics, however, leave the question of
being unattended as it concerns black(ness).]{.underline}** **[Both
assume being is applicable and
operative]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[---black humanism relies on
metaphysical being and postmetaphysics relies on multiple
interpretations or manifestations of being]{.underline}**. In other
words, the human's being grounds both philosophical perspectives.
Although postmetaphysics allows for a capacious understanding of the
human and Being, **[[it still posits being universally as it concerns
freedom; no entity is without it, even if it manifests differently, or
as difference, if we follow Deleuze]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is to
suggest that both discourses proceed as if the question of being has
been settled and that we no longer need to return to it---the question,
indeed, has been elided in critical discourses concerning blackness.
Ontological Terror seeks to put the question back in its proper place:
at the center of any discourse about Being. **[[Ontological Terror
meditates on this (non)relation between blackness and Being by arguing
that black being incarnates metaphysical nothing, the terror of
metaphysics, in an antiblack world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Blacks, then,
have function but not Being---the function of black(ness) is to give
form to a terrifying formlessness (nothing). Being claims function as
its property (all functions rely on being, according to this logic, for
philosophical pre sentation), but the aim of black nihilism is to expose
the unbridgeable rift between being and function for blackness. The
puzzle of blackness, then, is that it functions in an antiblack world
without being---much like "nothing" functions philosophically without
our metaphysical understanding of being, an extraordinary mystery.
**[Put differently, metaphysics is obsessed with both blackness and
nothing, and the two become synonyms for that which ruptures
metaphysical organization and form]{.underline}**. The Negro is black
because the Negro must assume the function of nothing in a metaphysical
world. The world needs this labor. This obsession, however, also
transforms into hatred, since nothing is incorrigible---it shatters
ontological ground and security. Nothing terrifies metaphysics, and
metaphysics attempts to dominate it by turning nothing into an object of
knowledge, something it can dominate, analyze, calculate, and
schematize. When I speak of function, I mean the projection of nothing's
terror onto black(ness) as a strategy of metaphysics' will to power.
How, then, does metaphysics dominate nothing? By objectifying nothing
through the black Negro. In this analysis, metaphysics can never provide
freedom or humanity for blacks, since it is the objectification,
domination, and extermination of blacks that keep the metaphysical world
intact. **[Metaphysics uses blacks to maintain a sense of security and
to sustain the fantasy of triumph---the triumph over the nothing that
limits human freedom]{.underline}**. [**[Without blacks, I argue,
nothing's terror debilitates metaphysical procedures, epistemologies,
boundaries, and institutions]{.underline}**. **[Black freedom, then,
would constitute a form of world destruction, and this is precisely why
humanism has failed to accomplish its romantic goals of equality,
justice, and recognition]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In short, **[[black
humanism has neglected the relationship between black(ness) and nothing
in its yearning for belonging, acceptance, and
freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The Negro was invented to fulfill
this function for metaphysics, and the humanist dream of transforming
invention into human being is continually deferred (because it is
impossible]{.underline}**). **[Ontological Terror challenges the claim
that blacks are human and can ground existence in the same being of the
human. [I argue that blacks are introduced into the metaphysical world
as available equipment in human form]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### A2 heidegeer is a nazi 

Warren 18

I shared this argument with a good friend at a conference, and he
politely whispered to me, "**[[You know Heidegger was sympathetic to
Nazism, don't you?"]{.underline}]{.mark}** I immediately whispered back,
"**[[Even more reason for black studies to read and engage
him!"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Heidegger might well be the most
influential philosopher of the twentieth century, since the question of
Being resides at the crux of every philosophical enterprise, and he
raised this question relentlessly. For me, this means **[that we cannot
escape Heidegger;]{.underline}** his Destruktion of Being has left its
trace on all our thinking---whether we admit it or not. **[W[e cannot
escape Heidegger because we cannot escape the question of
Being]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If the trace of Heidegger has left an
indelible impression, despite the attempts to purge him/his thought,
contemporary thinking still bears the abhorrent, the unforgivable, the
disaster, the devastation. **[The question, then, is not just whether
Heidegger was a Nazi (or antiblack for my purposes), but what his
critique of metaphysics can teach us about systemic violence and
devastation]{.underline}**. **[[Turning a blind eye to Heidegger will
not resolve anything, although affect might make us feel ethically
enlightened. Confronting/engaging]{.mark} [Heidegger, I argue, helps us
understand the relation between black suffering and metaphysics; slavery
and objectification; antiblackness and forgetfulness; thinking and
remembering]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (**[Heidegger's philosophy, in many
ways, can be read as an allegory of antiblackness and black
suffering]{.underline}**---the metaphysical violence of the
transatlantic slave trade.) **[To broach the insatiable question "Why
are blacks continually injured, degraded, pulverized, and killed?" would
require, then, an understanding of metaphysical violence and
pain]{.underline}**---since black suffering is metaphysical violence,
the violence of schematization, objectification, and calculative
thinking Heidegger spent his entire professional career exposing.
**[Perhaps Heidegger was really talking about black(ness) and black
suffering all along]{.underline}**.

####  Warren's habeas viscus feed the pornotroping of black flesh within the visual economy of antiblack capitalism

Warren 18

**[I interpret Hortense Spillers's term pornotroping as the
appropriation and use of the black body as a text,]{.underline}** a
sexualized text **[for fantasy]{.underline}**, prurient othering, **[and
unchecked gratification]{.underline}**. Within an antiblack grammatical
context, **[black bodies are pressed into the service of
a]{.underline}** sexualized semiotic and hermeneutic **[procedure
or]{.underline}**, as Spillers describes it, "**[externally imposed
meanings and uses]{.underline}**." How one interprets and makes meaning
of the black body as a sexual sign in an antiblack grammar is the
function of pornotroping. Alexander **[[Weheliye understands
pornotroping as translating into a scopic economy, where the
hieroglyphics of the flesh are sexualized through vision. Although I am
in full agreement with his presentation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
scopic dimensions of pornotroping, [**[I depart from his diacritical
analysis as it concerns the productive potential of it.]{.underline}**
**[I understand pornotroping as an antiblack strategy in the
metaphysical holocaust and not as a site for self-making or
freedom]{.underline}**]{.mark}; see Weheliye, Habeas Viscus: Racializing
Assemblages, Biopolitics, and Black Feminist Theories of the Human.

#### A2 Agency = no ontological terror

Warren 18

Jus, my objective in this book is to introduce an ontological
complication that exceeds, but also engenders discriminatory law
(mandatory emigration laws in Southern states, for example),
surveillance, and physical brutality (the free black whipped just like
the slave) of free blacks. These antiblack tactics have been well
documented, as it concerns the disciplining and subordination of free
blacks. What has been neglected, however, is an analysis on what exactly
happens to blacks once emancipated, or free---the transubstantiation
between property and something else. Did the black become a human once
free? If we answer in the affirmative, does the freedom paper undermine
the being of the human, given that without it, such claim to humanity
cannot be sustained? **[Are "masterless slaves," as free blacks have
been called, still property---property of whom?]{.underline}** What
determines the distinction between human masters and masterless slaves?
Is emancipation ontological creation, and what enables the malleability
of black being? These questions, questions still remaining, build a path
into a discussion of ontological complications the free black presents.
Ontological Terror broaches these questions to illumine something more
sinister about the condition of black being, a condition that impacts
all blacks in an antiblack world, not just the antebellum free black.
The historical singularity of free blacks knots together a deep
philosophical conflict between Being, blackness, and freedom---it is an
extraordinary paradigm for black thinking. **[My hope is that
historians, philosophers, and theorists will consider the free black,
much more than an anomalous population, a speculative frame within which
the foundations of humanism and metaphysics in general are
challenged]{.underline}**. Furthermore, [**[my concern is not to
fetishize agency or will. It is certainly the case that those beings we
call "free black" experienced the world through bonds, courage, despair,
friendship, and hope. These cannot be denied, but I do not think these
render these ~~beings~~ human or answer the metaphysical question in the
affirmative. No matter the bond, the act of courage, the indefatigable
fortitude, or the institutions established, the metaphysical holocaust
remains consistent]{.underline}**. **[No political action has or ever
will end it---it is necessary for the world.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[Jus, if we bundle certain capacities into something we call "agency,"
this bundle does not undermine metaphysical violence or the exclusion of
blackness from Being. The existence that provides the condition for
something we might call "agency" is not human ontology and not freedom.
[Our desperation to incorporate blacks into a narrative of humanistic
heroism often results in a disavowal of the problem of ontology, which
engenders the condition against which the courageous fight in the first
place. Black thinking, then, must explore what existence without Being
entails]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Free blacks do not inhabit the world in
the way the human does---historiography proceeds as if the problem of
existence has been resolved. It has not. My focus, here, will be on
the condition of the metaphysical holocaust or its manifestations and
not on individual narratives of free blacks. Jat work is certainly
important, too, but in this project I want to read the archive to
understand an ontological condition of execration.

Defend the dead. (Philip 2008, 26) **[[What does it mean to defend the
dead]{.underline}]{.mark}**? To tend to the Black dead and dying: to
tend to the Black person, to Black people, always living in the push

Vigilance, too, because any and everywhere we are, medical and other
professionals treat Black patients differently]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
often they don\'t listen to the concerns of patients and their families;
they ration palliative medicine, or deny them access to it altogether.
While there are multiple reasons for this (Stein 2007), experience and
research tell us \"**[[\'people assume that, relative to whites, blacks

\[9\] In honor of the twentieth anniversary of her groundbreaking 1987
Diacritics essay, \"Mama\'s Baby, Papa\'s Maybe: An American Grammar
Book,\" Hortense Spillers was interviewed collectively by Shirley
Eversley, Farah Jasmine Griffin, Saidiya Hartman, and Jennifer Morgan
for a special issue of The Feminist Press journal Women\'s Studies
Quarterly. On that occasion, Spillers reflected on her pivotal
intervention and the proximate series of articles---\"Interstices,\"
\"Notes on an Alternative Model,\" \"\'The Permanent Obliquity of an
In(pha)llibly Straight\'\": They all belong to that decade when we
\[black feminist scholars\] were searching for a vocabulary and didn\'t
find one that was immediately available. The available discourses all
seemed to come out of experiences that somehow, when they got to me, did
a detour. \[Laughter.\] Or the language broke down. Or it could not
speak in theoretical terms. \[\...\] And so my anxiety was finding a way
to actually be in battle. To actually go to war with a whole repertoire
of violent behavior that was always performed in a very genteel way
(301). \[10\] There are other moments in the interview where Spillers
employs martial language to describe her vocation. For instance: \"The
need to confront psychological violence, epistemic violence,
intellectual violence is really powerful. \'Mama\'s Baby, Papa\'s
Maybe\' was about bolstering myself, living to fight another day. I
became very good at being a marksman and ducking\" (ibid). Among other
points that Spillers attempts to make and maintain in this venue, this
combative phrasing would seem to underline a central point of commentary
for the entire event and perhaps her entire discourse: \"**[In black
culture a narrative of antagonism is inscribed in its memory\" (306).
\[11\] For Spillers, that narrative is fragile and endangered, but also
deeply grafted and irreducible. [Whatever else there may be in black
culture or cultures]{.mark}---in the most capacious, differentiated,
global sense---[a narrative of antagonism is inscribed there]{.mark},
powerfully and profoundly]{.underline}**. And yet, as Spillers also
demonstrates, that narrative is inscribed obliquely or obscurely, even
and perhaps especially when addressing itself to intramural affairs,
owing perhaps to an incommensurability between antagonism and narrative
form itself. How, then, to derive a discourse from an engagement with
and against the experience that Spillers indicates and inhabits in the
historic instance? How to sustain the language and, moreover, make it
speak in theoretical terms? How to theorize for battle, to go to war in
theory, to fight without experiencing a breakdown or detour in language?
How to stay within the anxiety of antagonism (and the narrative crisis
it precipitates), to be guided by it, and, again, even to will
it?[\[5\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-5)
\[12\] **[\"Blacks articulate and ruminate on these ensembles of
questions, in hushed tones, in back rooms, quietly, alone, or sometimes
only in our dreams\"]{.underline}** (Wilderson 2010: 140). So writes
Frank B. Wilderson, III midway through Red, White & Black: Cinema and
the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, the signal articulation of
Afro-Pessimism, a text that considers some of the less immediate
implications of Spillers\' intervention and elaborates them with respect
to a constellation of black thinkers viewed in parallax. Taken as a
point of departure, we might begin to wonder aloud: What is
Afro-Pessimism, in the first or final determination? What is involved in
thinking about it, thinking with it or through it or against it,
thinking its limit and its potential, thinking before it or beyond it or
under its heading? Is it a description of existing practical-theoretical
activity, or does it name an aspiration, a call or demand, or a wish? Is
it a portmanteau term or a neologism? Are we better served to think
about the intellectual convergence it names as something like a
contribution to the critique of political
ontology?[\[6\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-6)
\"Rather than celebrate Blackness as a cultural identity,\" writes
Wilderson, \"**[[Afro-Pessimism theorizes it as a position of
accumulation and fungibility]{.mark}; that is, as condition---or
relation---of ontological death.\"]{.underline}** Further, and due to
this insight, \"**[the Afro-pessimists are theorists of Black
positionality who share Fanon\'s insistence that, though Blacks are
indeed sentient beings, [the structure of the entire world\'s semantic
field\...is structured by anti-Black solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}**\"
(58). \[13\] There are over sixty references to Fanon in Red, White and
Black, suggesting that, in an important way, **[[Afro-Pessimism entails
a]{.mark} certain motivated reading or [return to]{.mark} Fanon, an
attention to Fanon the theorist of [racial slavery and \"negrophobia\"
more so than]{.mark} Fanon the theorist of metropolitan
[colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Crucially, this is not, as Jaye
Austin Williams (2013) would have it, a statement about an inherent
black incapability, but rather about an imposed black incapacity. Better
put, it is about the general incapacity, which is not to say the
ultimate incapability, of a world \"structured by anti-Black
solidarity\" to appreciate the sentience, much less the sapience, of
those marked by racial blackness, including most especially
African-derived people. The capability for such appreciation may well be
universal (though we have no good reason to suppose it), but black
folks, by way of a protracted labor of love beset by complications
inside and out, undoubtedly enjoy a privileged relationship to it. So,
if we hear talk about \"the state of virtual non-communication within
official culture\" (Wilderson 2010: 64), it is important to note that
warrant for use of the term \"virtual\" is not undermined by exceptions
to the rule. In a global semantic field structured by anti-black
solidarity**[, it stands to reasons that [the]{.mark} potential [energy
of a black]{.mark}, or blackened, [position holds out a singularly
transformative possibility]{.mark}, an energy generated by virtue of its
relation to others in a field of force]{.underline}**. \[14\]
Afro-Pessimism, by this route, critically supplements the paradigm of
critical ethnic studies in at least two ways: First, by moving
conceptually from the empirical to the structural or, more precisely,
from the experiential to the political ontological, especially insofar
as the question of differential racialization---or the complexity of
racial hierarchy---makes recourse to a comparative history and social
science. Second, by reframing racism as a relation grounded in
anti-blackness rather than white supremacy, or, more precisely, by
pushing through the conceptual framework of racism altogether toward an
apprehension of the world-historical transformation entailed in the
emergence of racial slavery. **[[The color line, as it were, operates
here as the division of the world into regions of blackness and
non-blackness, or slavery contrasted to forms of freedom]{.mark}
including the possessive investment in whiteness, rather than whiteness
and non-whiteness, or freedom as the possessive investment in whiteness
contrasted with forms of unfreedom defined by its relative absence or
prohibition]{.underline}**.[\[7\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-7)
In a related move, Afro-Pessimism seeks to decenter, without
diminishing, the analysis of political economy by discerning the
libidinal economy that underwrites and sutures its dynamics. And so, in
its formulation of power, and particularly of the nature and role of
violence, Afro-Pessimism does not only describe the operations of
systems, structures and institutions, but also, and perhaps more
importantly, the fantasies of murderous hatred and unlimited
destruction, of sexual consumption and social availability that animate
the realization of such violence. It is an analysis, in other words, of
how anti-black fantasies attain objective value in the political and
economic life of society and in the psychic life of culture as well.
Wilderson ponders, with respect to the medium and institution of cinema:
\"Can film tell the story of a sentient being whose story can be neither
recognized nor incorporated into Human civil society\" (96)? We may ask
too, can art, literature, music, theater, or, for that matter, theory?
\[15\] Afro-Pessimism is, in the words of Christina Sharpe, an attempt
\"to build a language that, despite the rewards and enticements to do
otherwise, refuses to refuse blackness, that embraces \'without pathos\'
that which is constructed and defined as pathology\.... It is work that
insistently speaks what is being constituted as the unspeakable and
enacts an ethical embrace of what is constituted as (affirmatively)
unembraceable.\" That is to say, **[[Afro-Pessimism is both an
epistemological and an ethical project]{.mark}, and these two
tributaries of thought converge in the carefully navigated stream of
consciousness [whose abstraction enables a theorem of political
ontology]{.mark} deduced or derived from the cutting edge of black
studies: that infinitely narrowing margin of practical-theoretical
activity [that provides us with weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Wilderson once more: If, when caught between the pincers of the
imperative to meditate on Black dispossession and Black political
agency, we do not dissemble, but instead allow our minds to reflect on
the murderous ontology of\...slavery\'s gratuitous violence---seven
hundred years ago, five hundred years ago, two hundred years ago, last
year, and today, then maybe, just maybe, we will be able to think
Blackness and agency together in an ethical manner (143, emphasis
added). \[16\] **[[There is no rejection of the notion of agency in
advance, but rather an endeavor to think rigorously about its conditions
of possibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The procedure involves the
abstraction of a conceptual framework regarding structural
positionality, a methodology regarding paradigmatic analysis, and a
structure of feeling regarding the politics of antagonism that, taken
together, remain implicit in the work of various luminaries of black
studies but whose full effects only become available when rendered
explicit and approached from another angle or raised to another level of
theorization]{.underline}**. That is the enabled task and, by and large,
it still remains before us now. In a sense, Afro-Pessimism is not an
intervention so much as it is a reading, or meta-commentary, on what we
seem to do with, or how we relate to, what black creative intellectuals
continue to generate without being able to bring fully into account. It
is a reading of what is gained and lost in the attempt---the
impulse---to delineate the spatial and temporal borders of
anti-blackness, to delimit the \"bad news\" of black life, to fix its
precise scope and scale, to find an edge beyond or before which true
living unfolds. It is an attempt to resist that centrifugal force that
overwhelms us like fear or exhausts us like
fatigue.[\[8\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html#footnote-8)
\[17\] And what of the so-called Afro-Pessimists? If they are, as
Wilderson puts it, \"nothing as ostentatious as a school of thought,\"
can they be described, as I have suggested elsewhere, as a motley crew?
Or is even that designation a stretch, since the notion of a crew
suggests the possibility for the formation of bonds of an impossible
collective identity? Perhaps we should speak then, simply, of a bunch,
or even a gathering of those whose gathering is what matters, like the
gathering of momentum or the gathering of a storm. What I hear in the
gathering discourse is a complex meditation on what Caribbean poet M.
NourbeSe Philip (2005) calls \"the matrix\" of \"modern capitalist
society,\" namely, \"the four hundred year \[plus!\] history of slavery,
which destroyed so much in African life\" (8). That history and that
destruction---both of which, it bears repeating, are ongoing---are very
much at the center of our thinking, as are the questions regarding how
one might inhabit that history and that destruction. **[There is an ars
vita here, maybe the truest one, because it emerges from within a global
catastrophe so total that [the creation or production of a black poetry,
a black art, a stylization of the black body, a black sense of place
cannot but be invented wholesale, which is to say made or devised
without recourse to a reliable memory or tradition, a law or language or
land, a body or kinship or community---no line to follow. So, too,
without a future promising anything different or, rather,
better]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} \[18\] The meditation, singular
and collective, works out from the space of the black body and its
surround and it wonders aloud about how blackness might be thought,
which is also to say presented and represented, in an anti-black world
that shapes and structures every aspect of black existence, except---or
including---whatever escapes. **[[Fugitivity is not freedom]{.mark}, or
not yet. And, [given the especially troubled history of black women\'s
claims to mobility and movement]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Davies 1994,
McKittrick 2006), **[[this is in an important sense a meditation issuing
from and about the black female body in particular, a meditation that
does not so much reiterate an analysis of gender difference and its
politics as it poses the question of the very possibility of engendering
and embodiment---a desire for formulation in the most profound
sens]{.mark}e]{.underline}**. What might a black girl or woman do with
her own body, or with her child or kin, or in her dwelling, on the
printed page, in song, in flight? And how might this thinking out from
the problematic of black feminism ramify upon the open range of black
sexual practice and gender performance? How to remark what is always
already marked? This is, in other words, a meditation on possibility of
the first order. It may be that the remedy to dispossession lies not in
the spirit of claiming or reclaiming possession but in the paradox of an
even greater and willed dispossession. But how, under constant assault,
to defend what cannot be possessed?

#### There is an ontological difference between the gratuitous violence of racial slavery and the dehumanization present in colonialist operations -- reject the 1AC's generic account of 'racism' which makes all violence equivalent in favor of a political ontology that locates the color line as black vs. non-black rather than white vs. non-white

**[Sexton]{.underline}** (Jared, Professor of African-American Studies
at UC-Irvine) **[2010]{.underline}** (The Curtain of the Sky: An
Introduction, Critical Sociology, Vol. 36 (1), pg. 11-24, C.A.)

**[Yet, for Wilderson, [there is a qualitative difference, an
ontological one, between the inferiorization or dehumanization of the
masses of people 'in Asia ... in America and the islands of the sea',
including the colonization of their land and resources, the exploitation
of their labor and even their extermination in whole or in part, and the
singular commodification of human being pursued under racial slavery,
that structure of gratuitous violence in which bodies are rendered as
flesh to be accumulated and exchanged]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
7On this score, we should note that 'the absolute submission mandated by
law was not simply that of slave to his or her owner, but the submission
of the enslaved before all whites' (Hartman 1997: 83). The latter group
is perhaps better termed all non-blacks (or the unequally arrayed
category of non-blackness), because **[[it is racial blackness as a
necessary condition for enslavement that matters most, rather than
whiteness as a sufficient condition for freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[The structural position of [the Indian slaveholder -- or]{.mark}, for
that matter[, the]{.mark} smattering of [free black slaveholders in the
USA or the slaveholding mulatto elite in the Caribbean -- is a case in
point]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Blackburn 1997; Koger 2006; Miles and
Holland 2006). **[Freedom from [the rule of slave law requires only that
one be considered non-black, whether that non-black racial designation
be 'white' or 'Indian' or, in the rare case,
'Oriental']{.mark}]{.underline}** -- this despite the fact that each of
these groups have at one point or another labored in conditions similar
to or contiguous with enslaved African-derived groups. In other words,
it is not labor relations, but property relations that are constitutive
of slavery. To repeat: **[[not all free persons are
white]{.underline}]{.mark}** (nor are they equal or equally free),
**[[but slaves are paradigmatically black]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Because **[blackness]{.underline}** serves as the basis of enslavement
in the logic of a transnational political and legal culture, it
**[permanently destabilizes the position of any nominally free black
population]{.underline}**. Stuart Hall might call this the articulation
of elements of a discourse, the production of a 'non-necessary
correspondence' between the signifiers of blackness and slavery (Hall
1996). But **[it is the historical materialization of the logic of a
transnational political and legal culture such that the contingency of
its articulation is generally lost to the infrastructure of the Atlantic
world that provides Wilderson a basis for the concept of a political
ontology of race that locates [the color line vis-a-vis slavery:
black/non-black rather than white/non-white]{.mark}. The USA provides
the point of focus here, but the dynamics under examination are not
restricted to its bounds]{.underline}**. Political ontology is not a
metaphysical notion, because it is the explicit outcome of a politics
and thereby available to historic challenge through collective struggle.
But it is not simply a description of a political status either, even an
oppressed or subjugated political status, because it functions as if it
were a metaphysical property across the longue durée of the pre-modern,
modern and now postmodern eras. That is to say, borrowing a distinction
from Jürgen Habermas, the application of the law of racial slavery is
pervasive, regardless of variance or permutation in its operation across
the better part of a millennium (Habermas 1985). 8 **[In Wilderson's
terms[, the libidinal economy of anti-blackness is pervasive, regardless
of variance or permutation in its political
economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 9 In fact**[, the application of slave
law among the free]{.underline}** (i.e. the disposition that 'with
respect to the African shows no internal recognition of the libidinal
costs of turning human bodies into sentient flesh') **[has outlived in
the post-emancipation world a certain form of its prior operation -- the
property relations specific to the institution of chattel and the
plantation-based agrarian economy in which it was
sustained.]{.underline}** As noted, Hartman describes this in her memoir
as the afterlife of slavery: 'a measure of man and a ranking of life and
worth that has yet to be undone ... a racial calculus and a political
arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago' (Hartman 2007: 6). **[On
that score, it is not inappropriate to say that the continuing
application of slave law facilitated the reconfiguration of its
operation with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US
Constitution, rather than its abolition]{.underline}** (on the
conventional reading) or even its circumscription 'as punishment for
crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted' (on the
progressive reading of contemporary critics of the prisonindustrial
complex). It is one of the great values of Wacquant's work, especially
in Wilderson's hands, that it provides an historical schema for tracking
such reconfigurations 'from slavery to mass incarceration' without
losing track of the structural dimension. 10 The challenge for all
subsequent scholarship in the overlapping fields of the sociology of
race and ethnic and racial studies is to orient itself within this
theoretical horizon if it is to attain what is most essential.

#### This sidelining of the fate of blacks undermines effective coalitions and produces alliances with an anti-black civil society. Vote Neg on presumption. 

**Sexton 10** (Jared, UC-Irvine,
https://eee.uci.edu/12w/22500/homepage/sexton_POC.blindness.ST.pdf)

If the oppression of nonblack people of color in, and perhaps beyond,
the United States seems conditional to the historic instance and
functions at a more restricted empirical scope, antiblackness seems
invariant and limitless (which does not mean that the former is somehow
negligible and short-lived or that the latter is exhaustive and
unchanging). If pursued with some consistency, the sort of comparative
analysis outlined above would likely impact the formulation of political
strategy and modify the demeanor of our political culture. In fact, it
might denature the comparative instinct altogether in favor of a
relational analysis more adequate to the task. **[[Yet all of this is
obviated by the silencing mechanism par excellence]{.mark} in Left
political and intellectual circles today: ["Don't play Oppression
Olympics!"]{.mark} The Oppression Olympics dogma levels a charge
amounting to little more than a leftist version of "playing the race

relational) analysis is to play into the hands of divide-and-conquer
tactics and to promote a callous immorality. However, as in its
conservative complement, **[one notes in this catchphrase the

colorblindness inherent to the concept of "people of color" to the
precise extent that **[[it misunderstands the specificity of
antiblackness and presumes or insists upon the monolithic character of
victimization under white supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** ---thinking
(the afterlife of) slavery as a form of exploitation or colonization or
a species of racial oppression among others. The upshot of this
predicament is that **[[obscuring the structural position of the

building as a politics of radical opposition and, to that extent, force
the question of black liberation back to the center of
discussion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Every

chain of equivalents]{.underline}]{.mark}** or returning to it as an
afterthought---**[[is doomed to miss what is essential about the
situation. Black existence does not represent the total reality of the
racial formation---it is not the beginning and the end of the
story---but it does relate to the totality; it indicates the (repressed)
truth of the political and economic system.]{.underline}]{.mark}** That
is to say, the whole range of positions within the racial formation is
most fully understood from this vantage point, not unlike the way in
which the range of gender and sexual variance under patriarchal and
heteronormative regimes is most fully understood through lenses that are
feminist and queer What is lost for the study of black existence in the
proposal for a decentered, \"postblack\" paradigm is a proper analysis
of the true scale and nature of black suffering and of the
struggles---political, aesthetic, intellectual, and so on---that have
sought to transform and undo it. What is lost for the study of nonblack
nonwhite existence is a proper analysis of the true scale and nature of
its material and symbolic power relative to the category of blackness.76
**[[This is why every attempt to defend the rights and liberties of

At the apex of the midcentury social movements, Kwame Ture and Charles
Hamilton wrote in their 1968 classic, Black Power: The Politics of
Liberation, that black freedom entails \"the necessarily total revamping
of the society.\" 77 For Hartman, thinking of the entanglements of the
African diaspora in this context, the necessarily total revamping of the
society is more appropriately envisioned as the creation of an entirely
new world: I knew that no matter how far from home I traveled, I would
never be able to leave my past behind. I would never be able to imagine
being the kind of person who had not been made and marked by slavery. I
was black and a history of terror had produced that identity. Terror was
\"captivity without the possibility of flight, \' inescapable violence,
precarious life. There was no going back to a time or place before
slavery, and going beyond it no doubt would entail nothing less
momentous than yet another revolution.78

[[The scandal with which the Black subject position threatens Gramscian
discourse is manifest in the subject's]{.mark} ontological
[disarticulation of]{.mark} Gramscian [categories: work, progress,
production, exploitation]{.mark}, hegemony, [and historical
self-awareness]{.mark}. By examining the strategy and structure of the
Black subject's absence]{.underline} in Antonio Gramsci's Prison
Notebooks and by contemplating the Black subject's incommensurability
with the key categories of Gramscian theory, we come face to face with
three unsettling consequences. [First, [the Black American subject
imposes a radical incoherence upon the assumptive logic of Gramscian
discourse]{.mark}. In other words, s/he implies a scandal. Secondly,
[the Black subject reveals marxism's inability to think White supremacy
as the base and,]{.mark} in so doing, [calls into question marxism's
claim to elaborate a comprehensive,]{.mark}]{.underline} or in the words
of Antonio Gramsci, ["[decisive" antagonism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Stated
another way: Gramscian [[Marxism]{.mark} is able to imagine the subject
which transforms her/himself into a mass of antagonistic identity
formations, formations which can precipitate a crisis in wage slavery,
exploitation, and/or hegemony, but it [is asleep at the wheel when asked
to provide]{.mark} enabling [antagonisms toward]{.mark} unwaged
[slavery]{.mark}, despotism, and/or terror. Finally, we begin to see how
[Marxism suffers from a]{.mark} kind of [conceptual
anxiety]{.mark}:]{.underline} a desire for socialism on the other side
of crisis---a society which does away not with the category of worker,
but with the imposition workers suffer under the approach of capital: in
other words, [the mark [of its conceptual anxiety is]{.mark} in [its
desire to democratize work and]{.mark} thus help keep in place, [insure
the coherence of, Reformation and Enlightenment]{.mark} "foundational"
[values of productivity and progress. This is a crowding-out scenario
for other post-revolutionary possibilities, i.e.
idleness.]{.mark}]{.underline} Why interrogate Gramsci with the
political predicament and desire of the Black(ened) subject position in
the Western Hemisphere? Because The Prison Notebooks' intentionality,
and general reception, lay claim to universal applicability. Neither
Gramsci nor his spiritual progenitors in the form of scholars or
activists say that the Gramscian project sows the seeds of freedom for
Whites only. Instead, they claim that deep within the organicity of the
organic intellectual is the organic Black intellectual, the organic
Chinese intellectual, the organic South American intellectual and so on;
that though there are historical and cultural variances, there is a
structural consistency which elaborates all organic intellectuals and
undergirds all resistance.

#### Marxism is rendered incoherent by the position of the Black subject---the Black American cannot be categorized by Marxist concepts like work, progress, production, and historical self-awareness---this reveals Marxism's inability to understand White supremacy as a base and calls into question the ability of the 1AC to be an antagonism---the desire to democratize work maintains the coherence of enlightenment values of progress and productivity, crowding out legitimate forms of resistance---that's Wilderson 

#### Anti-class methodologies assume that the position of Blacks and Whites are identical within civil society, ignoring the ways that civil society requires violence against blacks as a condition of its existence

**Wilderson 05**, Associate Professor @ UC IRVINE, Frank-Drama
Department at UC Irvine; "Gramsci's Black Marx: Whither the Slave in
Civil Society?;" WE WRITE; January 2(1).

It is true that Gramsci acknowledges no organic division between
political society and civil society. He makes the division for
methodological purposes. There is one organism, "the modern
bourgeois-liberal state" (Buttigieg 28), but there are two qualitatively
different kinds of apparatuses: on the one hand, the ensemble of
so-called private associations and ideological invitations to
participate in a wide and varied play of consensus making strategies,
civil society, and the other hand, a set of enforcement structures which
kick in when that ensemble is regressive or can no longer lead,
political society. But [[Gramsci would have us believe]{.mark} not
[that]{.mark} White positionality emerges and is elaborated on the
terrain of civil society and encounters coercion when civil society is
not expansive enough to embrace the idea of freedom for al[l]{.mark},
but that [all positionalities emerge]{.mark} and are elaborated [on the
terrain of civil society]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gramsci does not
racialize this birth, elaboration, and stunting, or re-emergence, of
human subjectivity-because civil society, supposedly, elaborates all
subjectivity and so there is no need for such specificity.
Anglo-American Gramscians like Buttigieg and Sassoon, and U.S.
[[activists in the anti-globalization movement]{.mark} whose unspoken
grammar is predicated on Gramsci's assumptive logic [continue this
tradition of unraced positionality which allows them to posit the
valency of Wars of Position for Blacks and Whites alike. They assume
that all subjects are positioned in such a way as to have their consent
solicited]{.mark}]{.underline} and to, furthermore, be able to extend
their consent "spontaneously." This is profoundly problematic if
only---leaving revolution aside for the moment---at the level of
analysis; for it assumes that hegemony with its three constituent
elements (influence, leadership, consent) is the modality which must be
either inculcated or breached, if one is to either avoid or incur,
respectively, the violence of the State. However, one of the primary
claims of this essay is that, [[whereas the consent of Black people may
seem to be called upon, its withdrawal does not recipitate a "crisis in
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}." Put another way, [[the transformation
of Black people's acquiescent "common sense" into revolutionary "good
sense" is]{.mark} an extenuating circumstance, but [not the catalyst, of
State violence against Black people. State violence against the Black
body]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Martinot and Sexton suggest in their
introduction, is not contingent, [it [is structural and,]{.mark} above
all, [gratuitous]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, Gramscian wisdom
cannot imagine the emergence, elaboration, and stunting of a subject by
way, not of the contingency of violence resulting in a "crisis of
authority," but by way of direct relations of force. This is remarkable,
and unfortunate, given the fact that [[the emergence of the
slave]{.mark}, the subject-effect of an ensemble of direct relations of
force, [marks the emergence of capitalism itself.]{.mark} Let us put a
finer point on it: [violence towards the Black body is the precondition
for]{.mark} the existence of Gramsci's single entity "[the modern
bourgeois-state]{.mark}" with its divided apparatus, political society
and civil society. This is to say violence against Black people is
ontological and gratuitous as opposed to ideological and contingent.
Furthermore, no magical momen]{.underline}t (i.e., 1865) [transformed,
paradigmatically, the Black body's relation to this entity]{.underline}
2. In this regard, [the [hegemonic advances within civil society by the
Left hold out no more possibility for Black life than the coercive
backlash of political society]{.mark}. What many political theorists
have either missed or ignored is that [a crisis of authority that might
take place by way of a Left expansion of civil society,]{.mark} further
[instantiates]{.mark}, rather than dismantles, [the authority of
Whiteness. Black death is the modern bourgeois-state's recreational
pastime,]{.mark} but the hunting season is not confined to the
time]{.underline} (and place) [of political society; [Blacks are fair
game as a result of a progressively expanding civil society as
well.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Modern capitalism was kick-started by slavery

Department at UC Irvine; "Gramsci's Black Marx: Whither the Slave in
Civil Society?;" WE WRITE; January 2(1).Civil Death in Civil Society

[[Capital was kick-started by the rape of the African continent.]{.mark}
This phenomenon is central to neither Gramsci nor Marx. The theoretical
importance of emphasizing this in the early 21st century is two-fold:
First, "[the socio-political order of the New
World]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Spillers 1987: 67) [[was kick-started by
approaching a particular body]{.underline}]{.mark} (a Black body) [[with
direct relations of force, not by approaching a White body with variable
capital]{.mark}. Thus, [one could say that
slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}---the "accumulation" of Black bodies
regardless of their utility as laborers (Hartman; Johnson) through an
idiom of despotic power (Patterson)---[[is closer to capital\'s primal
desire than is waged oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}---the
"exploitation" of unraced bodies (Marx, Lenin, Gramsci) that labor
through an idiom of rational/symbolic (the wage) power: A relation of
terror as opposed to a relation of hegemony.3 Secondly, today, late
capital is imposing a renaissance of this original desire, direct
relations of force (the prison industrial complex), the despotism of the
unwaged relation: and this Renaissance of slavery has, once again, as
its structuring image in libidinal economy, and its primary target in
political economy, the Black body.

#### Topicality as a procedural constraint is necessary for effective debate 

#### They destroy engagement -- predictable stasis ensures [research accessibility]{.underline} and [negative ground]{.underline}. Even if public policy isn't the best focus for activism, it's crucial for dialogue because it's grounded in consistent reporting and academic work. 

#### Two impacts - 

#### 1) Changing the topic post facto [structurally favors the aff]{.underline} by manipulating balance of prep -- vote neg b/c debate is a competitive game that's meaningless without substantive constraints.

#### 2) Also key to have well-prepared opponents. They transform debate into a monologue which means their arguments are presumptively false because they haven't been subjected to well researched scrutiny. 

#### Also destroys mechanism education

#### the failure to engage means the aff fails, coalitions break down, and hawks seize the political -- only engagement solves

#### Mouffe 2009 (Chantal Mouffe is Professor of Political Theory at the Centre for the Study of Democracy, University of Westminster, "The Importance of Engaging the State", *What is Radical Politics Today?*, Edited by Jonathan Pugh, pp. 233-7)The way we envisage social criticism has very important consequences for radical politics. [Radical politics]{.underline} today [is]{.underline} often [characterised in terms of]{.underline} desertion, exodus and [refusal to engage with existing institutions]{.underline}. Whereas I believe that [[radical politics should]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[be concerned with]{.mark} building [political engagement, through]{.mark} developing competing, [antagonistic]{.mark} [political claims]{.mark}]{.underline}. My aim here is to highlight the main differences between these two characterisations. The first could roughly be described as 'critique as withdrawal'; the second as 'critique as engagement'. I will argue that, ultimately, [the problem with]{.underline} the form of radical politics advocated by '[[critique as withdrawal']{.mark} is that it [has a flawed understanding of]{.mark} the]{.underline} very [nature of '[the political]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} itself. Critique as withdrawal The model of social criticism and radical politics put forward by Michel Hardt and Antonio Negri in their books Empire (2000) and Multitude (2004) is a good illustration of 'critique as withdrawal'. Empire is often referred to as the Communist manifesto for the twenty-first century in academic and activist conferences. In this book, the authors call for a total break with modernity and the elaboration of a postmodern approach. In their view such a break is required because of the crucial transformations of globalisation and the subsequent workers' struggle experienced by our society during the last decades of the twentieth century. According to Hardt and Negri, these transformations can be broadly summarised in the following way: 1. Sovereignty has taken a new form: there is a new global sovereignty, which Hardt and Negri call 'Empire'. They argue that this Empire is a new imperialism that replaces the attempt by nation states to extend their own sovereignty beyond their borders. In contrast to old-style imperialism, the current Empire has no territorial centre of power and no fixed boundaries; it is decentred and deterritorialised, progressively incorporating the entire global realm with open, expanding frontiers. 2. This transformation corresponds, they say, to the transformation of the capitalist mode of production. The role of industrial factory labour has been reduced. Priority is instead given to communicative, cooperative and affective labour. In the postmodernisation of the global economy, the creation of wealth tends towards regulating and mediating life itself. It permeates every aspect of our life. The scope of the rule of Empire is social life in its entirety. All aspects of our life are controlled -- from the way we work and exchange ideas across international borders, through to how we think about our body image. 3. We are witnessing the passage from a 'disciplinary society' to a 'society of control' characterised by a new paradigm of power. In the disciplinary society, which corresponds to the first phase of capitalist accumulation, command is constructed through diffuse networks of apparatus. These produce and regulate customs, habits and productive practices with the help of disciplinary institutions like prisons, factories, asylums, hospitals, schools and others. The society of control, in contrast, is a society in which mechanisms of command are less obvious. The society of control is dominated by the many mechanisms of the globalised, postmodern capitalist society, which seek to directly organise the brain and body (from the internet, through to complex global systems of trade). What is directly at stake is the regulation of life itself. This is what they call 'biopower'. 4. Hardt and Negri produce new terms to help explain this situation. These are 'mass intellectuality', 'immaterial labor' and 'general intellect'. The central role previously occupied by the labour-power of mass factory workers in the production of surplus-value is today said to be increasingly filled by intellectual, immaterial and communicative labour-power. For Hardt and Negri, the figure of immaterial labour involved in communication, cooperation and the reproduction of affects occupies an increasingly central position in the schema of capitalist production. 5. A new term is needed to refer to this collective worker that Hardt and Negri call the 'Multitude'. They believe that the transition to Empire -- where territorial state sovereignty is less important -- has opened up new possibilities for the liberation of this Multitude. The Multitude have shaped a new form of globalisation, which means that previous systems and structures of exploitation and control, such as the state, are no longer needed. This is why their book Empire is so often referred to as the Communist manifesto of the twenty-first century. [According to this manifesto, the]{.underline} creative [forces of the Multitude are capable of constructing a counter-empire, of overthrowing the state apparatus]{.underline} of control. The present systems of control are no longer necessary. An alternative political organisation of the global flows of exchange now dominates in this era of globalisation. We can, therefore, get rid of territorial sovereignty because it only serves to oppress our creativity. Hardt and Negri therefore clearly illustrate what I previously called, in my introduction to this chapter, 'critique as withdrawal': a refusal to engage with existing institutions. At this point it is worth introducing the work of Paolo Virno to complement the picture. Virno's analyses in his book Grammar of the Multitude (2004) dovetail in many respects with those of Hardt and Negri. But there are also some significant differences. For instance, he is much less sanguine about the future. While Hardt and Negri have a messianic vision of the role of the Multitude, which will necessarily bring down Empire and establish an 'Absolute Democracy', Virno does not. For Virno, the present conditions are not right for a communist future. It is unlikely that the sort of 'Absolute Democracy' that Hardt and Negri envisage will actually take place. Instead of seeing the generalisation of immaterial labour as a type of 'spontaneous communism' like Hardt and Negri, Virno tends to see post-Fordism as a manifestation of the 'communism of capital'. Under post-Fordism, consumers pursue different goals, with services responding accordingly. This means that today, for Virno, capitalistic initiatives orchestrate material and cultural conditions for their own benefit. And the role of political action should be to create a sphere of common affairs -- which he calls the 'Republic of the Multitude' -- to challenge this situation. Virno proposes two key terms to describe the type of political action which he thinks is necessary. These are 'exodus' and 'civil disobedience'. And for me, they again illustrate what I call 'critique as withdrawal': something which is an important and influential trend in radical politics today because exodus advocates [mass [defection]{.mark} from the state]{.underline}. This [[requires]{.mark} the development of [a non-state public sphere]{.mark} and a]{.underline} [radically new type of democracy]{.underline}. It involves experimenting in new forms of nonrepresentative and extra-parliamentary democracy, organised around leagues, councils and soviets. The Multitude never aspire to transform themselves into a majority. They develop a power that refuses to become government. This is why, according to Virno, civil disobedience needs to be emancipated from the liberal tradition. He does not just want to ignore specific laws if they do not conform to the principles of a given territorial constitution or state. For Virno, like Hardt and Negri, radical disobedience goes much further -- it puts the existence of the state itself in question. In both Hardt and Negri, and Virno, there is therefore emphasis upon 'critique as withdrawal'. They all call for the development of a non-state public sphere. They call for self-organisation, experimentation, non-representative and extra-parliamentary politics. [[They see forms of]{.mark} traditional [representative politics as]{.mark} inherently [oppressive]{.mark}. So [they do not seek to engage]{.mark} with them, [in order to challenge them]{.mark}]{.underline}. They seek to get rid of them altogether. This disengagement is, for such influential personalities in radical politics today, the key to every political position in the world[.]{.underline} The Multitude must recognise imperial sovereignty itself as the enemy and discover adequate means of subverting its power. Whereas in the disciplinary era I spoke about earlier, sabotage was the fundamental form of political resistance, these authors claim that, today, it should be desertion. It is indeed through desertion, through the evacuation of the places of power, that they think that battles against Empire might be won. Desertion and exodus are, for these important thinkers, a powerful form of class struggle against imperial postmodernity. According to Hardt and Negri, and Virno, radical politics in the past was dominated by the notion of 'the people'. This was, according to them, a unity, acting with one will. And this unity is linked to the existence of the state. The Multitude, on the contrary, shuns political unity. It is not representable because it is an active self-organising agent that can never achieve the status of a juridical personage. It can never converge in a general will, because the present globalisation of capital and workers' struggles will not permit this. It is anti-state and anti-popular. Hardt and Negri claim that the Multitude cannot be conceived any more in terms of a sovereign authority that is representative of the people. They therefore argue that new forms of politics, which are non-representative, are needed. They advocate a withdrawal from existing institutions. This is something which characterises much of radical politics today. [The emphasis is not upon challenging the state. Radical politics]{.underline} today [is]{.underline} often [characterised by a]{.underline} mood, a sense and a [feeling, that the state itself is inherently the problem.]{.underline} Critique as engagement I will now turn to presenting the way I envisage the form of social criticism best suited to radical politics today. I agree with Hardt and Negri that it is important to understand the transition from Fordism to post-Fordism. But I consider that the dynamics of this transition is better apprehended within the framework of the approach outlined in the book Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics (Laclau and Mouffe, 2001). What I want to stress is that many factors have contributed to this transition from Fordism to post-Fordism, and that it is necessary to recognise its complex nature. My problem with Hardt and Negri's view is that, by putting so much emphasis on the workers' struggles, they tend to see this transition as if it was driven by one single logic: the workers' resistance to the forces of capitalism in the post-Fordist era. They put too much emphasis upon immaterial labour. In their view, capitalism can only be reactive and they refuse to accept the creative role played both by capital and by labour. To put it another way, they deny the positive role of political struggle. In Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics we use the word 'hegemony' to describe the way in which meaning is given to institutions or practices: for example, the way in which a given institution or practice is defined as 'oppressive to women', 'racist' or 'environmentally destructive'. We also point out that [[every hegemonic order is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[susceptible to being challenged]{.mark} by counter-hegemonic practices]{.underline} -- feminist, anti-racist, environmentalist, for example. [This is illustrated by the plethora of new social movements which]{.underline} presently [exist]{.underline} in radical politics today (Christian, anti-war, counter-globalisation, Muslim, and so on). Clearly not all of these are workers' struggles. In their various ways they have nevertheless attempted to influence and have influenced a new hegemonic order. This means that [when we talk about 'the political', we do not lose sight of the ever present possibility of heterogeneity and antagonism]{.underline} within society. There are many different ways of being antagonistic to a dominant order in a heterogeneous society -- it need not only refer to the workers' struggles. I submit that it is necessary to introduce this hegemonic dimension when one envisages the transition from Fordism to post-Fordism. This means abandoning the view that a single logic (workers' struggles) is at work in the evolution of the work process; as well as acknowledging the pro-active role played by capital. In order to do this we can find interesting insights in the work of Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello who, in their book The New Spirit of Capitalism (2005), bring to light the way in which capitalists manage to use the demands for autonomy of the new movements that developed in the 1960s, harnessing them in the development of the post-Fordist networked economy and transforming them into new forms of control. They use the term 'artistic critique' to refer to how the strategies of the counter-culture (the search for authenticity, the ideal of selfmanagement and the anti-hierarchical exigency) were used to promote the conditions required by the new mode of capitalist regulation, replacing the disciplinary framework characteristic of the Fordist period. From my point of view, what is interesting in this approach is that it shows how an important dimension of the transition from Fordism to postFordism involves rearticulating existing discourses and practices in new ways. It allows us to visualise the transition from Fordism to postFordism in terms of a hegemonic intervention. To be sure, Boltanski and Chiapello never use this vocabulary, but their analysis is a clear example of what Gramsci called 'hegemony through neutralisation' or 'passive revolution'. This refers to a situation [where [demands]{.mark} which challenge the hegemonic order [are recuperated by the]{.mark} existing [system]{.mark}, which is achieved [by satisfying them in a way that neutralises their subversive potential.]{.mark}]{.underline} When we apprehend the transition from Fordism to postFordism within such a framework, we can understand it as a hegemonic move by capital to re-establish its leading role and restore its challenged legitimacy. We did not witness a revolution, in Marx's sense of the term. Rather, there have been many different interventions, challenging dominant hegemonic practices. It is clear that, [once we envisage social reality in terms of 'hegemonic' and 'counter-hegemonic' practices, radical politics is not about withdrawing completely]{.underline} from existing institutions. Rather, [[we have no]{.mark} other [choice but to engage with hegemonic practices]{.mark}, in order to challenge them.]{.underline} This is crucial; [[otherwise we will be faced with a chaotic situation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [if we do not engage]{.underline} with and challenge [the existing order,]{.underline} [[if we]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[choose to]{.mark} simply [escape the state]{.mark} completely, [we leave the door open for others to take]{.mark} control of]{.underline} systems of [[authority]{.underline}]{.mark} and regulation. Indeed there are many historical (and not so historical) examples of this. [[When the Left shows little interest, Right-wing]{.underline}]{.mark} and authoritarian [[groups are]{.mark} only too [happy to take over the state.]{.mark}]{.underline} The strategy of exodus could be seen as the reformulation of the idea of communism, as it was found in Marx. There are many points in common between the two perspectives. To be sure, for Hardt and Negri it is no longer the proletariat, but the Multitude which is the privileged political subject. But [in both cases [the state is seen as a monolithic apparatus]{.mark} of domination [that cannot be transformed. It has to 'wither away']{.mark} in order to leave room for a reconciled society beyond law]{.underline}, power and sovereignty[. [In reality]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} as I've already noted, [[others]{.underline}]{.mark} are often perfectly willing to [[take control]{.underline}]{.mark}. If my approach -- supporting new social movements and counterhegemonic practices -- has been called 'post-Marxist' by many, it is precisely because I have challenged the very possibility of such a reconciled society. [To acknowledge the ever present possibility of antagonism to the existing order implies recognising that heterogeneity cannot be eliminated.]{.underline} As far as politics is concerned, [this means the need to envisage it in terms of a hegemonic struggle between conflicting hegemonic projects attempting to incarnate the universal and to define the symbolic parameters of social life]{.underline}. [[A]{.mark} [successful hegemony fixes]{.mark} the meaning of [institutions]{.mark} and social practices]{.underline} and defines the 'common sense' through which a given conception of reality is established. However, [[such]{.mark} a result [is]{.mark} [always contingent]{.mark}]{.underline}, precarious [[and susceptible to being challenged]{.mark} by counter-hegemonic interventions. [Politics]{.mark} always [takes place in a field criss-crossed by antagonisms.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[A]{.mark} properly political [intervention]{.mark} is [always]{.mark} one that [engages]{.mark} with a certain [aspect of]{.mark} the existing [hegemony]{.mark}. It can never be merely oppositional]{.underline} or conceived as desertion, because it aims to challenge the existing order, [so that it may reidentify]{.underline} and feel more comfortable [with that order]{.underline}. [[Another]{.mark} important [aspect]{.mark}]{.underline} of a hegemonic politics [[lies in establishing linkages between]{.underline}]{.mark} various [[demands]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as environmentalists, feminists, anti-racist groups), so as [to transform them into claims that will challenge the existing structure of power relations.]{.underline} This is a further reason why critique involves engagement, rather than disengagement. It is clear that [the [different demands]{.mark} that [exist]{.mark} in our societies [are]{.mark} often [in conflict]{.mark} with each other]{.underline}. This is why [[they need to be articulated politically, which]{.underline}]{.mark} obviously [[involves]{.mark} the creation of [a collective will]{.mark}]{.underline}, a 'we'. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[requires]{.mark} the determination of [a]{.mark} '[them']{.mark}]{.underline}. This obvious and simple point is missed by the various advocates of the Multitude. For they seem to believe that the Multitude possesses a natural unity which does not need political articulation. Hardt and Negri see 'the People' as homogeneous and expressed in a unitary general will, rather than divided by different political conflicts. Counter-hegemonic practices, by contrast, do not eliminate differences. Rather, they are what could be called an 'ensemble of differences', all coming together, only at a given moment, against a common adversary. Such as when different groups from many backgrounds come together to protest against a war perpetuated by a state, or when environmentalists, feminists, anti-racists and others come together to challenge dominant models of development and progress. In these cases, the adversary cannot be defined in broad general terms like 'Empire', or for that matter 'Capitalism'. It is instead contingent upon the particular circumstances in question -- the specific states, international institutions or governmental practices that are to be challenged. Put another way, [the construction of political demands is dependent upon the specific relations of power that need to be targeted and transformed, in order to create the conditions for a new hegemony.]{.underline} This is clearly not an exodus from politics. It is not 'critique as withdrawal', but 'critique as engagement'. It is a 'war of position' that needs to be launched, often across a range of sites, involving the coming together of a range of interests. This can only be done by establishing links between social movements, political parties and trade unions, for example. [The aim is to create a common bond and collective will, engaging with a wide range of sites, and often institutions, with the aim of transforming them.]{.underline} 

#### Their model creates a structural disincentive to substantial research. Failure to defend the actor and mechanism of the resolution allows them to shift their advocacy to the terms most favorable to them -- causes dogmatism and forces the neg into generics at the margins of the literature -- destroys good scholarship. 

### 2NC Need Policy

#### Localized blueprints are necessary and have the potential to affect the macro political realm. Retreating from politics is NOT the way to create change. 

**Themba-Nixon, 2000** \[Makani, Jul 31, 2000, "Changing the Rules: What
Public Policy Means for Organizing",
http://search.proquest.com/docview/215539685?pq-origsite=summon\]

[[Policy is more than law. It is any]{.underline}]{.mark} written
[[agreement (]{.underline}]{.mark}formal or informal) [[that specifies
how an institution, governing body, or community will address shared
problems or attain shared goals]{.underline}]{.mark}. It spells out the
terms and the consequences of these agreements and is the codification
of the body\'s values-as represented by those present in the
policymaking process. Given who\'s usually present, most policies
reflect the political agenda of powerful elites. Yet, [[policy can be a
force for change-especially when we bring our base and community
organizing into the process.]{.mark}]{.underline} In essence, policies
are the codification of power relationships and resource allocation.
[[Policies are the rules of the world we live in. Changing the world
means changing the rules.]{.underline}]{.mark} So, [[if organizing is
about changing the rules and building power, how can organizing be
separated from policies?]{.underline}]{.mark} Can we really speak truth
to power, fight the right, stop corporate abuses, or win racial justice
without contesting the rules and the rulers, the policies and the
policymakers? The answer is no-and double no for people of color. Today,
[[racism subtly dominates nearly every aspect of
policymaking]{.underline}]{.mark}. From ballot propositions to city
funding priorities, policy is increasingly about the control,
de-funding, and disfranchisement of communities of color. What Do We
Stand For? Take the public conversation about welfare reform, for
example. Most of us know it isn\'t really about putting people to work.
The right\'s message was framed around racial stereotypes of lazy,
cheating \"welfare queens\" whose poverty was \"cultural.\" But the new
welfare policy was about moving billions of dollars in individual cash
payments and direct services from welfare recipients to other, more
powerful, social actors. Many of us were too busy to tune into the
welfare policy drama in Washington, only to find it washed up right on
our doorsteps. Our members are suffering from workfare policies, new
regulations, and cutoffs. Families who were barely getting by under the
old rules are being pushed over the edge by the new policies. Policy
doesn\'t get more relevant than this. And so we got involved in
policy-as defense. Yet we have to do more than block their punches. [[We
have to start the fight with initiatives of our
own]{.underline}]{.mark}. Those who do are finding offense a bit more
fun than defense alone. [[Living wage ordinances, youth development
initiatives, even gun control and alcohol and tobacco policies are
finding their way onto the public agenda, thanks to focused community
organizing that leverages power for community-driven
initiatives.]{.mark}]{.underline} - Over [[600 local policies have been
passed to regulate]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[tobacco]{.underline}]{.mark} industry. Local coalitions have taken the
lead by writing ordinances that address local problems and organizing
broad support for them. - Nearly [[100 gun control and violence
prevention policies]{.underline}]{.mark} have been enacted since 1991. -
Milwaukee, Boston, and Oakland are among the cities that have passed
[[living wage ordinances:]{.underline}]{.mark} local laws that guarantee
higher than minimum wages for workers, usually set as the minimum needed
to keep a family of four above poverty. These are just a few of the
examples that demonstrate how [[organizing for local policy advocacy has
made inroads in areas where positive national policy had been stalled by
conservatives.]{.underline}]{.mark} Increasingly, [[the local policy
arena is where the action is and where activists are finding
success.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, corporate interests-which are
usually the target of these policies-are gearing up in defense. [Tactics
include front groups, economic pressure, and the tried and true: cold,
hard cash.]{.underline} Despite these barriers, grassroots [[organizing
can be]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[effective at the smaller scale of
local politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the local level, we have greater
access to elected officials and officials have a greater reliance on
their constituents for reelection. For example, getting 400 people to
show up at city hall in just about any city in the U.S. is quite
impressive. On the other hand, 400 people at the state house or the
Congress would have a less significant impact. Add to that the fact that
all 400 people at city hall are usually constituents, and the impact is
even greater. Recent trends in government underscore the importance of
local policy. Congress has enacted a series of measures devolving
significant power to state and local government. Welfare, health care,
and the regulation of food and drinking water safety are among the areas
where states and localities now have greater rule. Devolution has some
negative consequences to be sure. History has taught us that, for social
services and civil rights in particular, the lack of clear federal
standards and mechanisms for accountability lead to uneven enforcement
and even discriminatory implementation of policies. Still, [[there are
real opportunities for advancing progressive initiatives in this more
localized environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Greater [[local control can
mean greater community power to shape and implement important social
policies]{.underline}]{.mark} that were heretofore out of reach[[. To do
so will require careful attention to the mechanics of local policymaking
and a clear blueprint of what we stand for.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The methodology of teaching that fosters hopelessness is the worst sort of Lynching, killings one's aspirations and should be CRUSHED. This is the very foundation that rationalizes the exploitation, enslavement and extermination of an "inferior" class.

of freedom have not risen up against the present propaganda]{.mark} in
the schools [and crushed it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This crusade is much
more important than the antilynching movement, because there would be no
lynching if it did not start in the schoolroom. **[[Why not exploit,

Given the material reality of white supremacy, the stakes at play in the
academic engagements with blackness are nothing less than the survival
of the Black community, but unfortunately this view is generally not
shared within the liberal academy. It is typically seen as a safe space
for exploration and play for young students. **[This paper challenges

Not all black feminists shared the same commitment to radical critique.
In fact, the left wing of the NBFO abandoned the movement after a year
because it failed to address the needs of the poor and spoke exclusively
to heterosexual women. Women active in the black lesbian community had
worked very hard to build an inclusive movement that addressed the needs
of all-irrespective of class or sexual orientation. So **[in 1974 a
group of radical black feminists in Boston broke with the NBFO and
formed the Combahee River Collective.]{.underline}** (The Combahee was
the name of the river in South Carolina where black abolitionist Harriet
Tubman led a military campaign during the Civil War-the only such
campaign planned by a woman. It resulted in the emancipation of more
than 750 slaves.) **[[The women who formed the collective came from
different movements in the Boston area, including the Committee to end
Sterilization Abuse and the campaign to free Ella Ellison-a black woman
inmate who, like Joan Little in North Carolina, was convicted of murder
for killing a prison guard in self-defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Nearly all the women had worked together to bring attention to a series
of unsolved murders of black women in Boston. **[[In 1977, three
collective members-Barbara Smith, Beverly Smith, and Demita
Frazier-issued "A Black Feminist Statement]{.mark}."]{.underline}**
Because they found themselves fighting many oppressions at once-racism,
sexism, capitalism, and homophobia-they regarded radical black feminism
as fundamental to any truly revolutionary ideology. They understood the
racial and sexual dimensions of domination, arguing that the history of
white men raping black women was "a weapon of political repression." At
the same time, they rejected the idea that all men were oppressors by
virtue of biology and borke with lesbian separatists who advocated a
politics based on sexuality. In their view, such an analysis "completely
denies any but the sexual sources of women's oppression, negating the
facts of class and race." And while they did not see black men as
enemies and called for broad solidarity to fight racism, they did
acknowledge patriarchy within black communities as an evil that needed
eradication. Black people as a whole, they argued, could not be truly
free as long as black women were subordinate to black men. As
socialists, the collective did not believe that a nonracist, nonsexist
society could be created under capitalism, but at the same time they
believed that socialism was not enough to dismantle the structures of
racial, gender, and sexual domination. The core of their vision was
manifest in their political practice. Combahee members immediately saw
connections between class, race, and gender issues by working in support
of "Third World women" workers, challenging health care facilities for
inadequate or unequal care, and organizing around welfare or day care
issues. **[[Although a broad vision of freedom informed the group's
work, its political positions remained flexible and subject to change.
They knew that the very process of struggle, in the context of a
democratic organization, would invariably produce new tactics, new
strategies, and new analyses]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "We believe in
collective process and a nonhierarchical distribution of power within
our own group and in our vision of a revolutionary society**[. [We are
committed to a continual examination of our politics as they develop
through criticism and self-criticism as an essential aspect of our
practice]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Finally, as black feminist Ann Julia
Cooper had suggested some eighty-five years earlier, **[the collective
insisted that black and Third World women's position at the bottom of
the race/class/gender hierarchy put them in a unique position to see the
scope of oppression and dream a new society. "[We might use our position
at the bottom]{.mark},]{.underline}**" they asserted, "**[[to make a
clear leap into revolutionary action. If black women were free, it would
mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would
necessitate the destruction of all systems of
oppression]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[[The Combahee River collective's "Statement" remains one of the most
important documents of the black radical movement in the twentieth
century]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It isn't just a brilliant text drafted
by very smart black women; it is a product of a collective social
movement. **[[The black radical imagination]{.mark}, as I have tried to
suggest throughout this book[, is s collective imagination engaged in an
acutual movement for liberation. It is fundamentally a product of
struggle, of victories and losses, crises and openings, and endless

environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Julia Sudbury's recent book, *Other
Kinds of Dreams: Black Women's Organisations and the Politics of
Transformation*, gives us a brilliant example of how activists produce
new knowledge and open new vistas for inquiry. She looks at black,
Asian, and Arab women's organizations in England and reveals how,
through their work, study, and discussion, they came to see how racism
is gendered, sexism is racialized, and class differences are reproduced
by capitalism and patriarchy. **[[Through personal narratives local
interventions, and research on the impact of specific policies
negatively affecting their respective communities, these activists
developed new modes of analyses and formulated new, imaginative,
transformative strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example**[, [Black
Women for Wages for Housework challenged existing academic and policy
oriented knowledge regarding who made up the working class by arguing
that children, women, and black men represented "the most comprehensive
working class struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}**." They saw recognition and
reparations for women's unpaid labor, then, as the primary site of any
global challenge to capitalism and imperialism. "**[[Counting black and
Third World people's contribution to every economy-starting by counting
women's unwaged work- is a way of refusing racism, claiming the wealth
back from military budgets, and establishing our entitlement to
benefits, wages, services, housing, healthcare, an end to
military-industrial pollution-not as charity but as rights and
reparations owed many times." Imagine what such a formulation could mean
for the reparations movement]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**Naples, 13** \[Nancy, Department of Sociology, University of
Connecticut, "Sustaining Democracy: Localization, Globalization, and

An intersectional angle of vision requires us to consider multiple sites
for empowerment and enablement (to borrow Saskia Sassen's \[2008\]
distinction[[) to ensure that the radical and transformative goals
remain at the center]{.underline}]{.mark}. In order to accomplish this,
[[state-sponsored projects should be linked closely with grassroots
efforts to ensure accountability and the incorporation of ongoing
outreach and training for inclusive democratic
practice]{.underline}]{.mark}. These projects also need to be attentive
to the cultural and political context--sharing social relations (Currier
2012; Mohanty 2006). [[As feminist projects]{.underline}]{.mark} like MS
[[become incorporated into the state bureaucracy, intersectional
feminist praxis calls for vigilance regarding the contradictions of the
state for empowerment, social justice, and progressive social
change]{.underline}]{.mark}. Andrea Cornwall and Vera Coelho (2007)
explore sites of citizen engagement with the state via "new democratic
spaces" that operate at the interstices of state and society. They
emphasize several of the dimensions I offer as significant for
intersectional feminist praxis; namely, that [[efforts to broaden
participation need to include attention to facilitating access and
promoting empowerment for participants, ensuring representation of
"marginalized groups," and developing action steps derived from
participatory process]{.mark}.]{.underline} The lessons they derive from
the case studies included in their edited collection on Spaces for
Change? demonstrate the need for [["subaltern
counterpublics]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Fraser 1992a:124) that [[serve as
sites for those from self-defined subaltern groups to deliberate and
construct claims that can be brought forward to the state or other
democratic spaces.]{.mark} ["Subaltern counterpublics" are sites where
groups who are typically marginalized or disenfranchised from a presumed
"universal public sphere" can]{.mark} [represent themselves through and
develop both a self-conscious articulation of the structural dynamics
that contribute to their marginalization and a plan for action that
contests an oppressive and hegemonic "rule by the majority
ideology."]{.mark}]{.underline} In the "subaltern counterpublics,"
[[marginal groups can develop "counterdiscourses" to contest hegemonic
ideologies that]{.mark} deny, dismiss, or [demonize their
"identities]{.mark}, interests, and needs"]{.underline} (Fraser
1992b:67). In this way, [[subaltern counterpublics contribute to a
process of inclusion that expands the public discourse beyond
"bourgeoisie" who dominate the "universal" public
spaces]{.underline}]{.mark} (see, e.g., Ferree et al. 2002). However,
[[for subaltern or marginalized groups to be]{.mark}]{.underline} 668
Naples [[drawn into these alternatives spaces, feminists and other
radical and progressive activists call for empowerment projects to
attract and train those who have had little opportunity to participate
in deliberative and participatory political
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}. These efforts come with their own set of
contradictions as Poletta (2002) and Cruikshank (1995) point out. In the
next section I highlight one successful approach to empowerment that is
strengthened by reflexive practice.

#### Our interpretation is that the aff gets contingency and the negative gets structural antagonism -- aff is neg ground -

#### Reasons To Prefer

#### First is clash -- having an agreed-upon stasis point prior to the debate is key to creating an accessible point of clash - changing the topic post facto structurally favors the aff because they speak last and permute alternatives---predictable ground and clash are key to engaging a well-prepared opponent and testing the affirmative's method -- the ability to defend a position against a knowledgeable opponent is key to export our politics to help our communities**.**

#### Second, we impact turn all of their 2AC offense -- Black Radical Liberalism is the most promising candidate for an emancipatory political theory

**Mills 15** \[Charles, the John Evans Professor of Moral and
Intellectual Philosophy at Northwestern University, "BLACK RADICAL
LIBERALISM (and why it isn't an oxymoron)," Feb 23,
http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2015/02/black-radical-liberalism-and-why-it-isnt-an-oxymoron.html/AK47\]

[["Black radical liberalism" is]{.underline}]{.mark} my attempt to
reconstruct from different and usually counterposed bodies of political
thought what I see as [[the most promising candidate for an emancipatory
African American political theory.]{.underline}]{.mark} So I am less
concerned with the question of whether any African American political
theorists actually self-consciously identified what they were doing
under this designation than with the question of whether it stands up to
criticism as a plausible way forward. In taxonomies of African
American/black political thought, the standard contrast would be:1 I am
arguing for [a synthesizing, reconstructed black liberalism]{.underline}
which [draws upon the most valuable insights of the black nationalist
and black Marxist traditions, and incorporates them into a dramatically
transformed liberalism.]{.underline} So the taxonomies would now be
drawn differently: Screen Shot 2015-02-23 at 9.04.04 AM How does black
radical liberalism differ from black mainstream liberalism? By
definition they are both "liberal" in endorsing liberalism as a
political philosophy, but [black radical liberalism seeks [to transform
liberalism to make it responsive to the alternative realities of the
black diasporic experience in modernity, and the correspondingly
necessary reordering of liberal normative priorities]{.mark}. Black
radical liberalism both (i) recognizes white supremacy as central to the
making of the United States and (more sweepingly) the modern world, and
(ii) seeks the rethinking of the categories, crucial assumptions, and
descriptive and normative frameworks of liberalism in the light of that
recognition.]{.underline} Black mainstream liberalism either (i) refuses
to recognize white supremacy (for example, by endorsing the "anomaly"
view of U.S. racism \[see Rogers Smith, Civic Ideals: Conflicting
Visions of Citizenship in US History\]) or, (ii) even if it does give
lip service to its reality, assumes nonetheless that the categories,
crucial assumptions, and descriptive and normative frameworks of
liberalism can be adopted with little change to the task of getting rid
of it. OBJECTIONS: (1) But how can Marxist and liberal insights be
reconciled? Aren't they necessarily opposed? Liberalism comes in
different varieties, and black radical liberalism would obviously be a
left-wing variety. Liberalism is opposed to state-commandist socialism,
but state-commandist socialism has proved itself to be a historical
failure, both economically and morally. Liberalism is not in principle
opposed to social democracy or market socialism. (2) But how can black
nationalist insights be reconciled either with Marxism or liberalism?
Black nationalism likewise comes in different varieties. The key insight
of the tradition, in my opinion, is the recognition of the reality and
centrality of an ontology of race, and how it shapes people and their
psychology, which can be accommodated in a modified Marxism and
liberalism. (Obviously this means rejecting essentialist versions of
black nationalism, whether onto-theological or culturalist. A "black
Marxist"/"left nationalist" tradition has long existed that addresses
these issues: see, e.g., Lucius Outlaw, Critical Social Theory in the
Interests of Black Folks.) (3) But [[how can]{.mark} even [a "black
radical liberalism"]{.mark}]{.underline} (assuming it doesn't fly apart
from centrifugal forces) [[deal with]{.mark} the problems identified
by]{.underline} Derrick Bell's "racial realism," or more recent
[["Afro-pessimism"? There are no guarantees, but then no other]{.mark}
competing [ideology can offer them either.]{.mark} Insofar as black
radical liberalism is attentive to]{.underline} trends within
[capitalism]{.underline} (e.g., the forthcoming consolidation and
exacerbation of plutocracy in the Western world predicted by Thomas
Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century), it would hope that an
increasing number of the white poor/white working class may begin to
wake up to the reality that the prospects for their children and
grandchildren under plutocratic capitalism---albeit white-supremacist
plutocratic capitalism---are not that great either. As a materialist
political philosophy, [black radical liberalism [does not rest its hopes
for social transformation on moral suasion]{.mark} alone, [but
on]{.mark} the [mobilization of group interests.]{.mark} The strategy
would be to combine the racial justice political project with a larger
social justice political project, highlighting the startling fact that
the U.S. has the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of all
the Western democracies.]{.underline} So that (very sketchily) would be
the real-world agenda. Let us now look at the (academic world)
implications for Rawlsian liberalism. CHALLENGING MAINSTREAM WHITE
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY Screen Shot 2015-02-23 at 9.10.39 AM IDEAL vs.
NON-IDEAL THEORY In A Theory of Justice Rawls famously focuses on "ideal
theory," the normative theory of a perfectly just society, one of
"strict compliance" with its principles of justice. Ideal theory,
however, was supposed to be the necessary preliminary to properly doing
non-ideal theory, including "compensatory justice." But 40+ years later,
the transition to theorizing "compensatory justice" has still not been
made, and contemporary Rawlsian discussions of non-ideal theory are
dealing with other senses of the term. Obviously, [for a population
historically subordinated in modernity through slavery, colonialism, and
Jim Crow, non-ideal theory is the imperative. Afro-modern (as it is now
called) political philosophy is centrally shaped by the experience of
oppression, domination, exploitation, etc. So black radical liberalism
is going to be a variety of non-ideal-theory liberalism, liberalism
dealing with the overcoming of social oppression in a nominally liberal
society.]{.underline} WELL-ORDERED vs. ILL-ORDERED SOCIETIES A related
distinction is the difference between well-ordered (perfectly just) and
(what I am going to call) ill-ordered societies. Rawls suggests we think
of societies as "cooperative ventures for mutual advantage." But [[a
white supremacist state is not a cooperative venture for mutual
advantage.]{.underline}]{.mark} To assume the cooperative-venture
characterization would be to rule racist societies out of normative
consideration from the start. So [black radical liberalism rejects such
a stipulation. [Instead, it]{.mark} works with a conception of society
broad enough to include ill-ordered societies. Ill-ordered societies are
coercive rather than cooperative ventures, characterized by exploitation
and asymmetries of respect rather than mutual advantage and reciprocal
respect. Ill-ordered societies are, in other words, the
world.]{.underline} CORRECTIVE JUSTICE In his A Short History of
Distributive Justice, Samuel Fleischacker points out that universal
distributive justice as a norm in the Western tradition is only slightly
more than 200 years old (and of course initially really just extends
over the "universe" of white males). At first, not even white women are
included (Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract), and certainly not people
of color in Western societies (Mills, The Racial Contract). "Corrective
justice" as a concept is even more undeveloped and untheorized,
especially where groups are concerned. Basic implication: Western
normative theory in general historically for most of 2500 years, and
liberalism for most of modernity, has been complicit with rather than
condemnatory of, group subordination. The under-theorization in the
tradition of corrective justice for subordinated groups, despite the
subordination of most of the population nominally in the theory's ambit,
is itself a manifestation of this complicity. [Black radical
liberalism]{.underline} reverses these normative priorities, and [[makes
corrective justice its central concern.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Third, Black Switch Side Debate is key to all your offense -- Conviction Based Debate (CBD) results in debates where the debaters have already decided their position in debate and the world such that we do not consider our relationship to Others. It produces insular debates that destroy education, ethics and reproduces anti-blackness because Conviction Based Debate is based off an assumption of mastery embedded in whiteness. 

**Evans 12** \[Rashad, JD., Black debate extraordinare and JD, "The
1NC," Nov 20, http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/\]

Now, the debate! First, let me look at Casey Harrigan's ("CH")
definition of SSD. He says that : Definition: switch side debate (SSD)
is the practice that requires debaters to argue both for and against a
given topic in alternating rounds. In effect, it has meant that
debaters' arguments are divorced from personal conviction and instead
made contingently as a means of "testing" the truth value of a
proposition. I will accept this definition, but I think it requires some
more refinement. In a practical sense, [[SSD]{.mark}, at a minimum,
[requires that the affirmative defend the
resolution.]{.mark}]{.underline} For the most part, the negative is
unconstrained (except by competition) and most debates in which SSD
comes up the question is whether the affirmative team should be required
to affirm the topic, including some defense of an action by the United
States Federal Government ("USFG"). **[[The essential question posed by
SSD is whether the affirmative team should be required to defend the
resolution even when they (1) fundamentally disagree with all or part of
it and/or (2) are compelled to affirm other ideas because of their
"personal convictions]{.underline}."]{.mark}** The answer to this
question must be yes. First, [[there are multiple
ways]{.underline}]{.mark} to skin a cat and even more ways [t[o affirm
the resolution]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the world of parametric debate
because [one need only affirm an interpretation of the resolution and
not the resolution writ large.]{.mark}]{.underline} Therefore, [[there
are rare instances in which there is no interpretation of the resolution
that you cannot defend and these rare instances are most likely the
product of lack of creativity and research]{.mark}.]{.underline} So in
reality, the question is an even simpler one: should the affirmative
team be required to defend an interpretation of the resolution. There
are immense constitutive and instrumental benefits to SSD that cannot be
otherwise obtained and therefore must be required. I ask that the
judges: George, Justin and Kyla evaluate this debate holistically, which
requires that they evaluate the benefits of SSD to the speaker
(constitutive) and to society (instrumental). This also requires that
they exclude nothing in their analysis of this debate. The Constitutive
[Debaters benefit from SSD. It requires that they engage in topics that
they may not otherwise engage.]{.underline} The resolution poses a
unique question and the debate round is a unique time to answer that
question. One is much more likely to consider their personal convictions
outside of the debate round than they are to consider the resolution
outside the debate round. [Therefore, independently of whether one
agrees with the resolution or not, there are benefits to
[defending]{.mark} an interpretation of [the resolution]{.mark} in that
it [requires you to consider something]{.mark} you may not have
[otherwise]{.mark} considered. These [thought expiriments create more
informed and thoughtful debaters]{.mark} and citizens.]{.underline} [SSD
creates a unique opportunity for self-reflexivity.]{.underline} The idea
is to let your personal convictions guide you in the debate. [[The
resolution doesn't require that you suppress your identity]{.mark} or
convictions, but is instead an opportunity to infuse that identity and
those convictions into the resolution and public policy
discussion.]{.underline} So, given who you are, what you believe and
what you know what say you regarding energy production? What say you
regarding democracy assistance? What say you regarding federal control
in Indian Country? Therefore, [[the resolution is an opportunity for you
to refine your personal convictions and put your identity in politics
instead of relying exclusively on identity politics.]{.mark} SSD allows
you to check your own privilege.]{.underline} Here, I will rely on my
personal experience. I once participated in a 30 day creative challenge
where the challenge leader would pose questions on facebook and the
group would answer them in the comments section. One day he asked us to
imagine we could be the other gender for 3 days and to discuss what
would we do. I thought about this on the A-train from Harlem to Chelsea
and again from Chelsea to Harlem and had no answer because I couldn't
imagine being a woman. I explained that as a gay man I don't need to be
a woman to have sex with a man, I don't want a baby in me and more
importantly I don't want the physical vulnerability of being a woman.
This realization really forced me to reevaluate my previous jokes even
that as a gay many I was ontologically indistinct from a woman. I am
not. I am gay and I am black...in many ways I am the the worlds bottom,
but even I could would not want to occupy the body of a woman. That
thought experiment taught me a lot about myself, privilege and the
world. Sometimes, you have to take a walk in someone else's stiletto to
learn who you really are. Seriously CH, have you walked in stilettos? It
will change your life. [[SSD is both necessary and sufficient to ensure
that you debate your personal convictions.]{.mark} Remember, if you are
staunchly opposed to the resolution [you get to]{.mark} [lodge]{.mark}
those [complaints on the negative.]{.mark} Also, remember that what is
good for the goose is good for the gander and [if you don't have to
debate the resolution then no one has to]{.mark} debate the resolution.
[This]{.mark} loosening of the restrictions on the resolution may [mean
that no one gets to debate anything they want.]{.mark}]{.underline} I
mean lets face it, no one wants to be topical! There's always a better
version of your aff that isn't topical. Every 2AC considers severance or
intrinsicness because the resolution is flawed or insufficient. However,
a true debater understands that they both have [to debate on the
affirmative and the negative]{.underline} and that in order to do either
[effectively [there must be stability in the relationship between the
aff]{.mark}irmative [and]{.mark} the [neg]{.mark}ative.]{.underline}
Therefore, committing yourself to the resolution is key preserving your
own negative ground to engage in your critique of the resolution. As
goes the resolution so goes your personal convictions about that
resolution. The Instrumental [SSD is the only way to organize a fair
debate tournament.]{.underline} We must have a topic. There must be
rules and allowing any and everyone go rogue because of their "personal
convictions" it is a recipe for disaster. I don't want to live and
debate in that world. [There must be strict requirements on defending
the resolution to allow for fair and predictable negative
ground.]{.underline} By the way, protecting [[fair negative ground is
easier and more important than all other concerns regarding
fairness.]{.mark} All people of all convictions have to be negative at
some point. Which means that [the affirmative-negative dialiectic is the
only intersectional analysis]{.mark} that can be performed
[because]{.mark} all people of [all identities will eventually find
themselves]{.mark} on the [aff]{.mark}irmative or [neg]{.mark}ative side
in debate. Preserving negative ground then preserves the ground of
women, minorities and hippies.]{.underline} SSD ensures that we have all
hands on deck in these extraordinary times. We need all perspectives and
all peoples to engage in all debates. SSD facilitates this. [Allowing
students to pick their own topic because of their "[personal
convictions"]{.mark} may [mean that important issues get ignored]{.mark}
all together.]{.underline} I mean, what would happen if we let the
students set the curriculum? Would they learn anything, ever? How many
times have you heard these questions in a classroom: why do I have to
learn this? Will this be on the exam? My major is X, why do I need to
learn Y? Blah. Yes, students would almost always like to do what they
want to do. If we allowed this where would we be as a country? Who will
be there to tackle the important questions pertaining to immigration,
energy production, the Arab Spring, etc? [Engaging the resolution from
your specific social location can cause others to change their
views.]{.underline} There are several examples of creative
interpretations of the resolution that have inspired folk to view the
topic and life differently. This is when debate is at its best and when
it's engaging in important knowledge production. Debate and debaters
have the potential to infuse new arguments, ideas and perspectives into
the resolution and into the broader discussion. Now, the line by line!
CH says: 1. It presumes debate as a "pedagogical bull-pen", which
undermines the activity's potential for radical change. Students are
told "you can't know anything until you debate both sides", ignoring the
VAST WEALTH of lived experience that underwrites specific claims about
identity, the world, praxis, and the topic. In some ways, it is like
Loyola's argument about info accumulation -- we are told to place a hold
on "conviction" until we have "enough information" and "enough testing"
when in reality there is either never a point where "enough is enough"
OR we have \*already\* crossed that point and should be able to utilize
the debate space for advocacy. It makes debate into a game about
hypothetical action rather than a potential site for social justice.
First, there are radically topical interpretations of the resolution.
Second, [how does one know that their lived experience is dispositive of
any debate without testing it against the research and lived experiences
of others. It's not that you can't know anything until you debate both
sides but more importantly that you debate both sides before you
conclude you know anything. Lastly, [there is no internal link between
resolutional debate and the loss of social justice.]{.mark} In fact,
[one should always debate the resolution in a way that produces social
justice.]{.mark}]{.underline} 2. It is anti-Black. The norm of SSD and
topic construction mandating USFG action presume that public policy is
valuable because it is equally accessible to all participants, when in
reality access is ANYTHING BUT that, relies on a belief that USFG action
is a locus for change when in reality and history it has produced the
opposite, marginalizes individual perspectives as "too local", and does
not account for the specific conditions of Black participation in
debate. Your anti-Blackness argument is without warrant. [[To the extent
that anti-Blackness is a problem, SSD is the solution.]{.mark}
Certainly, holding on to ones conviction in avoidance of debate has
never benefited Black people in the past[. Thinking itself is
Blackness]{.mark}]{.underline} (whiteness is anti-thought), [[so
avoiding a debate because of personal conviction is quintessentially
anti-Black.]{.underline}]{.mark} In fact, many of debates current ills
stem from people avoiding debates and holding fast to their convictions.
[Also, [the USFG is not uniquely anti-Black. The world is anti-Black, so
to isolate the USFG is to]{.mark} fundamentally [misunderstand
Blackness.]{.mark} The USFG has been a locus for change where others
have failed. For instance, the civil rights act regulated the racist
behavior of private individuals and corporations.]{.underline} School
desegregation required federal intervention to ensure state compliance
with the constitution. The Violence Against Women's Act regulates
individual behavior in the home which was once considered a private
matter. [This is not to suggest that [the USFG]{.mark} is a saint, but
to suggest that the [question requires more nuance]{.mark} and that
nuance is [provided only by SSD.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The specific
conditions of Blackness require SSD.]{.underline} After years of
exclusion from education generally and debate specifically, its right
time that we jump into the discussions. [[Black SSD not equal white SSD.
Black debate]{.mark}rs are the future and they will remake the world
partially in an image of themselves. [This requires that they theorize
their Blackness across topics, resolutions and debates.]{.mark} [This is
the revolution we are waiting for.]{.mark}]{.underline}

# Cap K (Academy) 

#### Link - It doesn't matter how great of an academic you are. Without a specific defense of action to be taken, you'll never be the radical that the system needs because you just bind the revolution inside of a book. Instead, the meaningless production of the 1AC only recreates the system it critiques by attempting to combat monolithic ideals. 

**Bryant 12** (Levi Bryant is Professor of Philosophy at [Collin
College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_College) "McKenzie Wark:
How Do You Occupy an Abstraction" August 4, 2012
<http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/mckenzie-wark-how-do-you-occupy-an-abstraction/>
)

In the language of my machine-oriented ontology or onticology, we would
say that [we only ever encounter local manifestations of hyperobjects,
local events or appearances of hyperobjects, and never the hyperobject
as such. Hyperobjects as such are purely virtual or withdrawn. They
can't be directly touched]{.underline}. And what's worse, contrary to
Locke's principle of individuation whereby an individual is individuated
by virtue of its location in a particular place and at a particular
time, hyperobjects are [without a site or place. They are]{.underline},
as Morton says, [non-local. [This,]{.mark} then, [is a central
problem]{.mark}, for [how do you combat something that is everywhere and
nowhere?]{.mark} How do you engage something that is
non-local?]{.underline} If an army is over there I can readily target
it. If a particular munitions factor is over here, then I can readily
target it[. But how do we target something that is non-local and that is
incorporeal? [This is the problem with occupying an
abstraction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, contemporary capitalism is
massively redundant. This, I think, is what Wark is getting at when he
speaks of contemporary power as "vectoral". Under what Wark calls
"vector power", we have configurations of power where attacks at one
site have very little impact insofar as flows can simply be re-channeled
through another set of nodes in the network. Like a hydra, you cut off
one head only to have another head appear in its place. The head can
never be cut off once and for all because there is no single head. [[The
crisis of contemporary politics is]{.mark} thus [the crisis of the
erasure of site]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[In the age of hyperobjects,
we]{.mark} come to [dwell in a world where there is no clear site of
political]{.mark} [antagonism and therefore no real sense of how and
where to engage]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here I'm also inclined to say that
[[we need to be clear about system references in our political
theorizing and action]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We think a lot
about]{.mark} the [content of]{.mark} our political [theorizing]{.mark}
and positions[, but I don't think we think]{.mark} a lot about [how
our]{.mark} political [theories]{.mark} are supposed to [actually act in
the world. As a result]{.mark}, much contemporary leftist political
[theory ends up]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in a performative contradiction.
It claims]{.underline}]{.mark}, following Marx, [that [it's aim is not
to represent the world but to change]{.mark} it, [yet it]{.mark} [never
escapes]{.mark} the burrows of [academic journals, and
conferences]{.mark}, and presses [to actually do
so]{.mark}.]{.underline} Like the Rat-Man's obsessional neurosis where
his actions in returning the glasses were actually designed to fail,
[there seems to be a built in tendency in [these forms of
theorization]{.mark} to unconsciously [organize their own]{.mark}
[failure]{.mark}]{.underline}. And here I can't resist suggesting that
this comes as no surprise given that, in Lacanian terms[, [the left is
the position of]{.mark} the hysteric and as such has "[a desire
for]{.mark} an [unsatisfied desire]{.mark}]{.underline}". In such
circumstances [[the worst thing consists in getting what you
want]{.mark}. We on [the left need to]{.mark} traverse our fantasy so as
to [avoid this]{.mark} sterile and self-defeating
repetition;]{.underline} and this entails [[shifting
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the position of [[political
critique]{.underline}]{.mark} (hysterical protest[), [to political
construction]{.mark}-- [actually envisioning and
building]{.mark}]{.underline} [[alternatives]{.mark}.]{.underline} So
what's the issue with system-reference? The great autopoietic
sociological systems theorist, Niklas Luhmann, makes this point nicely.
For Luhmann, there are intra-systemic references and inter-systemic
references. Intra-systemic references refer to processes that are
strictly for the sake of reproducing or maintaining the system in
question. Take the example of a cell. A cell, for-itself, is not for
anything beyond itself. The processes that take place within the cell
are simply for continuing the existence of the cell across time. While
the cell might certainly emit various chemicals and hormones as a result
of these processes, from its own intra-systemic perspective, it is not
for the sake of affecting these other cells with those hormones. They're
simply by-products. Capitalism or economy is similar. Capitalists talk a
good game about benefiting the rest of the world through the
technologies they produce, the medicines they create (though usually
it's government and universities that invent these medicines), the jobs
they create, etc., but really the sole aim of any corporation is
identical to that of a cell: to endure through time or reproduce itself
through the production of capital. This production of capital is not for
anything and does not refer to anything outside itself. These operations
of capital production are intra-systemic. By contrast, inter-systemic
operations would refer to something outside the system and its
auto-reproduction. They would be for something else. Luhmann argues that
every autopoietic system has this sort of intra-systemic dimension.
Autopoietic systems are, above all, organized around maintaining
themselves or enduring. This raises serious questions about academic
political theory. [[Academia is an autopoietic
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} As an autopoietic system, [[it aims
to]{.mark} endure, [reproduce itself]{.mark}]{.underline}, etc. [[It
must engage in operations]{.mark} or procedures from moment to moment
[to do so]{.mark}. [These operations consist in the production of
students that]{.mark} eventually [become scholars]{.mark} or professors,
the [writing]{.mark} of [articles]{.mark}, the [giving]{.mark} of
[conferences]{.mark}, the production of books and classes]{.underline},
etc. [All of these are operations [through which the academic system
maintains]{.mark} [itself]{.mark} across time]{.underline}. [[The
horrifying consequence]{.mark} of this [is that the reasons]{.mark} we
might give for why [we do what we do]{.mark} might]{.underline} (and
[[often)]{.underline}]{.mark} [[have little to do with]{.mark} [what's
actually taking]{.mark} [place]{.mark} in system
continuance]{.underline}. [[We say that our articles are designed to
demolish capital, inequality, sexism, homophobia]{.mark}, climate
disaster, etc., [but if we look]{.mark} [at how this system actually
functions]{.mark} we suspect that [the references]{.mark} here [are only
intra-systemic]{.mark}]{.underline}, that they are only [[addressing the
choir or other]{.mark} [academics]{.mark}]{.underline}, that they are
[only about [maintaining that system]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that
[[they never proliferate through the broader world]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Indeed, [[our]{.mark} very [style is]{.mark} often [a big]{.mark} [fuck
you to]{.mark} the rest of [the world]{.mark} as it requires expert
knowledge to be comprehended]{.underline}, thereby [[insuring that it
can have no impact on broader collectives to]{.mark} produce
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Seen in this light, it becomes clear that
our talk about changing the world is a sort of alibi, a sort of
rationalization, for a very different set of operations that are taking
place. [Just as the capitalist says he's trying to benefit the
world,]{.underline} [the academic tries to say he's trying to change the
world when all he's really doing is maintaining a particular
operationally closed autopoietic system.]{.underline} [How to break this
closure is a key question for any truly engaged political theory. And
part of breaking that closure will entail eating some humble
pie.]{.underline} [Adam Kotsko [wrote a wonderful and hilarious
post](http://itself.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/the-practical-know-how-of-humanities-academics/)
on the absurdities of some political theorizing and its self-importance
today.]{.underline} [[We've failed horribly with university
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} and defending the humanities, yet in our
holier-than-thou attitudes we call for a direct move to communism.
Perhaps we need to reflect a bit on ourselves and our strategies and
what political theory should be about.

#### Their basic frame for politics reconfirms the failures of the Left, turning debate into a Vampires' Castle where the propagation of guilt and cycles of pseudo-activity overcome meaningful theorizing and political change

**Fisher 13** (Mark Fisher, commissioning editor at Zer0 Books,
programme Leader of the MA in Aural and Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths,
University of London, lecturer at the University of East London,
"Exiting the Vampire Castle," The North Star, November 22, 2013)

Inside the Vampires' Castle The first configuration is what I came to
call the Vampires' Castle. [The Vampires' Castle specialises in
propagating guilt]{.underline}. [It is driven by a priest's desire to
excommunicate and condemn]{.underline}, [an academic-pedant's desire to
be the first to be seen to spot a mistake]{.underline}, and [a hipster's
desire to be one of the in-crowd]{.underline}. [The danger in attacking
the Vampires' Castle is that it can look as if]{.underline} -- and [it
will do everything it can to reinforce this thought]{.underline} --
[that one is also attacking the struggles against racism, sexism,
heterosexism]{.underline}. [But, far from being the only legitimate
expression of such struggles, the Vampires' Castle is best understood as
a bourgeois-liberal perversion and appropriation of the energy of these
movements]{.underline}. [The Vampires' Castle was born the moment when
the struggle not to be defined by identitarian categories became the
quest to have 'identities' recognised by a bourgeois big Other. The
privilege I certainly enjoy as a white male consists in part in my not
being aware of my ethnicity and my gender]{.underline}, and [it is a
sobering and revelatory experience to occasionally be made aware of
these blind-spots]{.underline}. [But, rather than seeking a world in
which everyone achieves freedom from identitarian classification, the
Vampires' Castle seeks to corral people back into identi-camps, where
they are forever defined in the terms set by dominant power, crippled by
self-consciousness and isolated by a logic of solipsism which insists
that we cannot understand one another unless we belong to the same
identity group. I've noticed a fascinating magical inversion
projection-disavowal mechanism whereby the sheer mention of class is now
automatically treated as if that means one is trying to downgrade the
importance of race and gender]{.underline}. [In fact, the exact opposite
is the case, as the Vampires' Castle uses an ultimately liberal
understanding of race and gender to obfuscate class]{.underline}. [In
all of the absurd and traumatic twitterstorms about
privilege]{.underline} earlier this year [it was noticeable that the
discussion of class privilege was entirely absent]{.underline}. [The
task]{.underline}, as ever, [remains the articulation of class, gender
and race -- but the founding move of the Vampires' Castle is the
dis-articulation of class from other categories. The problem that the
Vampires' Castle was set up to solve is this: how do you hold immense
wealth and power while also appearing as a victim, marginal and
oppositional?]{.underline} [The solution was already there -- in the
Christian Church]{.underline}. [So the VC has recourse to all the
infernal strategies, dark pathologies and psychological torture
instruments Christianity invented,]{.underline} and [which Nietzsche
described in The Genealogy of Morals]{.underline}. [This priesthood of
bad conscience, this nest of pious guilt-mongers, is exactly what
Nietzsche predicted when he said that something worse than Christianity
was already on the way. Now, here it is ... The Vampires' Castle feeds
on the energy and anxieties and vulnerabilities of young students, but
most of all it lives by converting the suffering of particular groups --
the more 'marginal' the better -- into academic capital]{.underline}.
[The most lauded figures in the Vampires' Castle are those who have
spotted a new market in suffering]{.underline} -- [those who can find a
group more oppressed and subjugated than any previously exploited will
find themselves promoted through the ranks very quickly. The first law
of the Vampires' Castle is: individualise and privatise
everything]{.underline}. While [in theory it claims to be in favour of
structural critique, in practice it never focuses on anything except
individual behaviour]{.underline}. Some of these working class types are
not terribly well brought up, and can be very rude at times. Remember:
[condemning individuals is always more important than paying attention
to impersonal structures]{.underline}. The actual ruling class
propagates ideologies of individualism, while tending to act as a class.
(Many of what we call 'conspiracies' are the ruling class showing class
solidarity.) [The VC]{.underline}, as dupe-servants of the ruling class,
does the opposite: it [pays lip service to 'solidarity' and
'collectivity']{.underline}, [while always acting as if the
individualist categories imposed by power really hold]{.underline}.
[Because they are petit-bourgeois to the core, the members of the
Vampires' Castle are intensely competitive, but this is repressed in the
passive aggressive manner typical of the bourgeoisie]{.underline}. [What
holds them together is not solidarity, but mutual fear -- the fear that
they will be the next one to be outed, exposed, condemned. The second
law of the Vampires' Castle is: make thought and action appear very,
very difficult]{.underline}. [There must be no lightness, and certainly
no humour. Humour isn't serious, by definition, right]{.underline}?
[Thought is hard work, for people with posh voices and furrowed
brows]{.underline}. [Where there is confidence, introduce
scepticism]{.underline}. [Say: don't be hasty, we have to think more
deeply about this. Remember: having convictions is oppressive, and might
lead to gulags. The third law of the Vampires' Castle is: propagate as
much guilt as you can]{.underline}. [The more guilt the
better]{.underline}. [People must feel bad: it is a sign that they
understand the gravity of things]{.underline}. [It's OK to be
class-privileged if you feel guilty about privilege and make others in a
subordinate class position to you feel guilty too. You do some good
works for the poor, too, right? The fourth law of the Vampires' Castle
is: essentialize]{.underline}. [While fluidity of identity, pluarity and
multiplicity are always claimed on behalf of the VC members]{.underline}
-- [partly to cover up their own invariably wealthy, privileged or
bourgeois-assimilationist background]{.underline} -- [the enemy is
always to be essentialized]{.underline}. [Since the desires animating
the VC are in large part priests' desires to excommunicate and condemn,
there has to be a strong distinction between Good and Evil, with the
latter essentialized. Notice the tactics]{.underline}. [X has made a
remark/ has behaved in a particular way -- these remarks/ this behaviour
might be construed as transphobic/ sexist etc]{.underline}. [So far,
OK]{.underline}. But [it's the next move which is the kicker. X then
becomes defined as a transphobe/ sexist etc. Their whole identity
becomes defined by one ill-judged remark or behavioural
slip]{.underline}. [Once the VC has mustered its witch-hunt, the victim
(often from a working class background, and not schooled in the passive
aggressive etiquette of the bourgeoisie) can reliably be goaded into
losing their temper, further securing their position as pariah/ latest
to be consumed in feeding frenzy. The fifth law of the Vampires' Castle:
think like a liberal (because you are one).]{.underline} [The VC's work
of constantly stoking up reactive outrage consists of endlessly pointing
out the screamingly obvious: capital behaves like capital (it's not very
nice!), repressive state apparatuses are repressive]{.underline}. We
must protest! Neo-anarchy in the UK [The second libidinal formation is
neo-anarchism]{.underline}. By neo-anarchists [I definitely do not mean
anarchists or syndicalists involved in actual workplace
organisation]{.underline}, such as the Solidarity Federation. [I mean,
rather, those who identify as anarchists but whose involvement in
politics extends little beyond student protests and occupations, and
commenting on Twitter]{.underline}. Like the denizens of the Vampires'
Castle, [neo-anarchists usually come from a petit-bourgeois background,
if not from somewhere even more class-privileged]{.underline}. They are
also overwhelmingly young: in their twenties or at most their early
thirties, and what informs the neo-anarchist position is a narrow
historical horizon. Neo-anarchists have experienced nothing but
capitalist realism. By the time the neo-anarchists had come to political
consciousness -- and many of them have come to political consciousness
remarkably recently, given the level of bullish swagger they sometimes
display -- the Labour Party had become a Blairite shell, implementing
neo-liberalism with a small dose of social justice on the side. [But the
problem with neo-anarchism is that it unthinkingly reflects this
historical moment rather than offering any escape from it]{.underline}.
It forgets, or perhaps is genuinely unaware of, the Labour Party's role
in nationalising major industries and utilities or founding the National
Health Service. [Neo-anarchists will assert that 'parliamentary politics
never changed anything']{.underline}, or [the 'Labour Party was always
useless']{.underline} while attending protests about the NHS, or
retweeting complaints about the dismantling of what remains of the
welfare state. [There's a strange implicit rule here: it's OK to protest
against what parliament has done, but it's not alright to enter into
parliament or the mass media to attempt to engineer change from
there]{.underline}. [Mainstream media is to be disdained, but BBC
Question Time is to be watched and moaned about on Twitter]{.underline}.
[Purism shades into fatalism]{.underline}; [better not to be in any way
tainted by the corruption of the mainstream, better to uselessly
'resist' than to risk getting your hands dirty.]{.underline} It's not
surprising, then, that so many neo-anarchists come across as depressed.
This depression is no doubt reinforced by the anxieties of postgraduate
life, since, like the Vampires' Castle, neo-anarchism has its natural
home in universities, and is usually propagated by those studying for
postgraduate qualifications, or those who have recently graduated from
such study. [What is to be done? Why have these two configurations come
to the fore]{.underline}? [The first reason is that they have been
allowed to prosper by capital because they serve its
interests]{.underline}. [Capital subdued the organised working class by
decomposing class consciousness, viciously subjugating trade unions
while seducing 'hard working families' into identifying with their own
narrowly defined interests instead of the interests of the wider
class]{.underline}; but [why would capital be concerned about a 'left'
that replaces class politics with a moralising individualism, and that,
far from building solidarity, spreads fear and insecurity? The second
reason is]{.underline} what Jodi Dean has called [communicative
capitalism]{.underline}. [It might have been possible to ignore the
Vampires' Castle and the neo-anarchists if it weren't for capitalist
cyberspace]{.underline}. [The VC's pious moralising has been a feature
of a certain 'left' for many years]{.underline} -- [but, if one wasn't a
member of this particular church, its sermons could be
avoided]{.underline}. [Social media means that this is no longer the
case, and there is little protection from the psychic pathologies
propagated by these discourses. So what can we do now]{.underline}?
[First of all, it is imperative to reject identitarianism, and to
recognise that there are no identities, only desires, interests and
identifications]{.underline}. [Part of the importance of the British
Cultural Studies project]{.underline} -- as revealed so powerfully and
so movingly in John Akomfrah's installation The Unfinished Conversation
(currently in Tate Britain) and his film The Stuart Hall Project -- [was
to have resisted identitarian essentialism]{.underline}. [Instead of
freezing people into chains of already-existing equivalences, the point
was to treat any articulation as provisional and plastic]{.underline}.
[New articulations can always be created]{.underline}. [No-one is
essentially anything]{.underline}. [Sadly, the right act on this insight
more effectively than the left does]{.underline}. [The
bourgeois-identitarian left knows how to propagate guilt and conduct a
witch hunt, but it doesn't know how to make converts]{.underline}. But
[that, after all, is not the point]{.underline}. [The aim is not to
popularise a leftist position, or to win people over to it, but to
remain in a position of elite superiority, but now with class
superiority redoubled by moral superiority too. 'How dare you talk --
it's we who speak for those who suffer!']{.underline} But [the rejection
of identitarianism can only be achieved by the re-assertion of
class]{.underline}. [A left that does not have class at its core can
only be a liberal pressure group]{.underline}. [Class consciousness is
always double]{.underline}: [it involves a simultaneous knowledge of the
way in which class frames and shapes all experience, and a knowledge of
the particular position that we occupy in the class
structure]{.underline}. [It must be remembered that the aim of our
struggle is not recognition by the bourgeoisie, nor even the destruction
of the bourgeoisie itself]{.underline}. [It is the class
structure]{.underline} -- [a structure that wounds everyone, even those
who materially profit from it]{.underline} -- [that must be
destroyed]{.underline}. [The interests of the working class are the
interests of all]{.underline}; [the interests of the bourgeoisie are the
interests of capital]{.underline}, [which are the interests of
no-one]{.underline}. [Our struggle must be towards the construction of a
new and surprising world, not the preservation of identities shaped and
distorted by capital. If this seems like a forbidding and daunting task,
it is]{.underline}. But [we can start to engage in many prefigurative
activities right now]{.underline}. Actually, [such activities would go
beyond pre-figuration -- they could start a virtuous cycle, a
self-fulfilling prophecy in which bourgeois modes of subjectivity are
dismantled and a new universality starts to build itself]{.underline}.
[We need to learn, or re-learn, how to build comradeship and solidarity
instead of doing capital's work for it by condemning and abusing each
other]{.underline}. [This doesn't mean]{.underline}, of course, [that we
must always agree]{.underline} -- on the contrary, [we must create
conditions where disagreement can take place without fear of exclusion
and excommunication]{.underline}. [We need to think very strategically
about how to use social media]{.underline} -- [always remembering that,
despite the egalitarianism claimed for social media by capital's
libidinal engineers, that this is currently an enemy territory,
dedicated to the reproduction of capita]{.underline}l. But [this doesn't
mean that we can't occupy the terrain and start to use it for the
purposes of producing class consciousness]{.underline}. [We must break
out of the 'debate' that communicative capitalism in which capital is
endlessly cajoling us to participate in, and remember that we are
involved in a class struggle]{.underline}. [The goal is not to 'be' an
activist, but to aid the working class to activate -- and transform --
itself. Outside the Vampires' Castle, anything is possible.]{.underline}

#### Impact - Judge consumption -- idealized resistance -- still don't do anything

**Tonn, 5** \[Mari Boor, phd philosophy from the University of Kansas,
associate professor of rhetoric and communication studies at the
University of Richmond, "Taking Conversation, Dialogue, and Therapy
Public", Rhetoric & Public Affairs 8.3 (2005) 405-430\]

Approaching public controversies through a conversational model informed
by therapy also enables political inaction in two respects. First, [[an
open-ended process lacking mechanisms for closure thwarts progress
toward resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Freeman writes of
consciousness raising, an [[unstructured, informal
discussio]{.underline}]{.mark}n \[End Page 418\] \"[[leaves people with
no place to go and the lack of structure leaves them with no way of
getting there]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}70 Second, [[the therapeutic
impulse to emphasize the self as both problem and solution ignores
structural impediments constraining individual agency.
\"Therapy,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} Cloud argues, \"[[offers consolation
rather than compensation,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[individual adaptation
rather than social change, and an experience of politics that
is]{.underline}]{.mark} impoverished in its [[isolation from structural
critique and collective action.\" Public discourse emphasizing healing
and coping,]{.mark}]{.underline} she claims, \"[[locates blame and
responsibility for solutions in the private
sphere.\"]{.underline}]{.mark} Clinton\'s Conversation on Race not only
exemplified the frequent wedding of public dialogue and therapeutic
themes but also illustrated the failure of a conversation-as-counseling
model to achieve meaningful social reform. In his speech inaugurating
the initiative, Clinton said, \"Basing our self-esteem on the ability to
look down on others is not the American way . . . Honest dialogue will
not be easy at first . . . Emotions may be rubbed raw, but we must
begin.\" Tempering his stated goal of \"concrete solutions\" was the
caveat that \"power cannot compel\" racial \"community,\" which \"can
come only from the human spirit.\"72 Following the president\'s cue to
self-disclose emotions, citizens chiefly aired personal experiences and
perspectives during the various community dialogues. In keeping with
their talk-show formats, the forums showcased what Orlando Patterson
described as \"performative \'race\' talk,\" \"public speech acts\" of
denial, proclamation, defense, exhortation, and even apology, in short,
[[performances of \"self\" that left little room for productive public
argument]{.underline}]{.mark}.73 Such personal evidence [[overshadowed
the \"facts\" and \"realities]{.underline}]{.mark}\" Clinton also had
promised to explore, including, for example, statistics on
discrimination patterns in employment, lending, and criminal justice or
expert testimony on cycles of dependency, poverty, illegitimacy, and
violence. Whereas Clinton had encouraged \"honest dialogue\" in the name
of \"responsibility\" and \"community,\" Burke argues that \"[[The
Cathartic Principle\"]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[produces the reverse.
\"\[C\]onfessional,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} he writes, \"[[contains in
itself a kind of \'personal irresponsibility,]{.underline}]{.mark}\' as
[[we may even relieve ourselves of private burdens by befouling the
public medium.\" More to the point, \"a thoroughly \'confessional\' art
may enact a kind of \'individual salvation at the expense of the
group,\']{.underline}]{.mark}\" performing a \"sinister function, from
the standpoint of overall-social necessities.\"74 Frustrated observers
of the racial dialogue---many of them African Americans---echoed
Burke\'s concerns. Patterson, for example, noted, \"when a young
Euro-American woman spent nearly five minutes of our \'conversation\' in
Martha\'s Vineyard . . . publicly confessing her racial insensitivities,
she was directly unburdening herself of all sorts of racial guilt
feeling. There was nothing to argue about.\"75 Boston Globe columnist
Derrick Z. Jackson invoked the game metaphor communication theorists
often link to \[End Page 419\] skills in conversation,76 voicing
suspicion of a talking cure for racial ailments that included neither
exhaustive racial data nor concrete goals. \"The game,\" wrote Jackson,
\"is to get \'rid\' of responsibility for racism while doing nothing to
solve it.\"77 Contributing to the ineffectiveness of a therapeutic
approach in redressing social problems is its common pairing with what
Burke terms \"incantatory\" imagery, wherein [[rhetors invite persons to
see themselves in an idealized form]{.underline}]{.mark}.78 Comparing a
current conflicted self against a future self individuals aspire to
become is a therapeutic staple, a technique Clinton mimics in his speech
on race[[. In one breath, he acknowledges persistent racial
\"discrimination]{.underline}]{.mark} and prejudice\"; [[in another,
he]{.mark}]{.underline} overtly [[invites audience members to picture
themselves in saintly fashion]{.underline}]{.mark}: \"Can we be one
America respecting, even celebrating, our differences, but embracing
even more what we have in common?\"79 But outside private therapy,
[[this strategy rarely results in honest
self-disclosure,]{.mark}]{.underline} especially regarding thorny issues
such as race. Andrew Hacker argues that individuals seldom speak
candidly about race in public; rather, they express an \"idealized\"
self with ideas and feelings they desire or, more commonly, believe they
should possess, a phenomenon evident even in anonymous polling.80 [[The
hazard of blending the confessional with the
incantatory,]{.underline}]{.mark} Burke writes, is a \"[[sentimental and
hypocritical\" false reassurance that society is on the proper course,
rendering remedial action unnecessary]{.underline}]{.mark}.81 This
danger is compounded if the problem initially has been couched as
essentially attitudinal rather than structural, as Clinton did: \"We
have torn down the barriers in our laws. Now we must break down the
barriers in our lives, our minds and our hearts.\"82 Indeed, in
commenting on the therapeutic bent of the Conversation on Race, William
L. Taylor argues that the late Bayard Rustin\'s reservations about the
social-psychological approach to race were prescient: \"Rustin said he
could envision America being persuaded figuratively to lie down on the
psychiatrist\'s couch to examine their feelings about race. They would
likely arise, he said, pronouncing themselves either free or purged of
any bias. And nothing would have changed.\"83

#### The alternative is to theorize through Marxist Materialism, which contests the political efficacy and descriptive accuracy of the 1AC by returning to the conceptual tools long central to the American black radical tradition

**Ferguson '15** (Stephen C., Assoc. Prof. in Liberal Studies @ North
Carolina A & T State U., *Philosophy of African American Studies:
Nothing Left of Blackness*, p. 7-14)

Marxism in Ebony Materialist Philosophical Inquiry and Black Studies In
any academic discipline, there exist varying, oftentimes even
conflicting, conceptual frameworks, theoretical approaches, and methods.
Black Studies is no different. In light of the theoretical works
prominent today, however, a number of students in AAS might easily
conclude that philosophical idealism is the only school of thought. To
the contrary, [Black Leftist activists were significant players during
the early period of Black Studies.]{.underline} [The first introductory
textbooks in African American Studies were written by Marxist/socialist
scholars]{.underline} and activists; for instance, Peoples College\'s
Introduction to Afro-American Studies and Clarence Munford\'s Production
Relations, Class and Black Liberation: A Marxist Perspective in
Afro-American Studies. Communist like Jack O\'Dell and Robert Rhodes
taught African American Studies courses at the Antioch College branch
campus in Washington, D. C. And pioneering Black historian and
\"antibourgeois gadfly\" Earl Thorpe - chair of the history department
at North Carolina College - was recruited to teach courses on \"Marxism
and Black Liberation\" for the Black Studies program at Duke
University.23 However, [today, Leftist thought is marginal to the
politics and philosophy of Black Studies. Socialism and Marxism-Leninism
are integral parts of African American history and culture.]{.underline}
Of course, [Marxist scholar/activists contributed to African American
intellectual history and culture long before what is]{.underline}, in
more formal terms, [considered the advent of Black Studies]{.underline}
during the late 1960s. [In the tradition of]{.underline} Hubert
[Harrison,]{.underline} Susie Revels [Cayton,]{.underline} Maude White
Katz, Richard B. Moore, Paul [Robeson,]{.underline} Oliver Cox, Eugene
Holmes, Abram Harris, Claudia Jones, Walter Rodney, Angela [Davis,
and]{.underline} John [McClendon, there is a need to bring the Black
working-class-men and women-back into AAS. A materialist philosophy
inquiry into Black Studies is grounded on three
presuppositions.]{.underline} [A materialist conception of epistemology
and ontology presumes that there is a reality independent of our
consciousness.]{.underline} [A materialist ontology asserts the primacy
of material reality over consciousness.]{.underline} [And a materialist
epistemology posits that this reality is knowable and knowledge or what
is cognitive]{.underline} (social consciousness) [corresponds to
and]{.underline} thus [ideally approximates this material
reality.]{.underline} Lastly, [a materialist philosophy presupposes that
the social world is a stratified ontology of which class
relations]{.underline} (i.e., social relations of production) [form the
ground for understanding social processes.]{.underline} [The call for a
materialist conception of science and epistemology should not be seen as
a call for an essentialist ascription of AAS, wherein it is viewed only
as a social scientific enterprise devoid of cultural
studies.]{.underline} [The current popularity of cultural
studies]{.underline}, often in collaboration with various species of
historicism and postmodernist trends, [fosters a separation between
cultural studies and social relations of production.]{.underline} As a
school of thought, [it gives less attention to the material conditions
that give rise to African American culture and relativizes the objective
character of the Black experience.]{.underline} In my estimation, [the
Black working-class has become lost in the whirlwind of cultural
idealism.]{.underline} [Contemporary Black cultural theory -- under the
spell of poststructuralism and Afrocentricity -- has declared: class is
dead! All that exists is intersectionality and a \"matrix of
domination,\" in which everyone is oppressed]{.underline} -- women, men,
capitalist, workers, children, ad infinitum. [And there is a tendency in
Black Studies to transform the Black workingclass into some obscure gray
matter known as the consumer]{.underline}, the multitude, or -- my
favorite from the \"friends of the poor\" -- the Black underclass.24
[The relevance and importance of the Black working-class must be brought
to the forefront of Black Studies.]{.underline}25 [This would entail
discarding analytical notions such as \"cultural deprivation,\" \"human
capital,\" \"culture of poverty,\" \"nihilism,\" \"feminization of
poverty,\" \"intersectionality,\" \"underclass,\" \"cultural
pathology,\" and \"menticide\" that]{.underline} have served to [explain
the contemporary]{.underline} and historical [crisis that confronts the
Black working-class.]{.underline} [We must discard the cultural idealism
of]{.underline} Maulana Karenga, Corne! West, Jawanza Kunjufu, Marimba
Ani, Patricia Hill Collins, Molefi Asante, and William Julius Wilson who
perceive [the \"Negro Question\'\' as an ideological or axiological
crisis]{.underline}, for example, as alienation from ancient African
values, the loss of a \"love ethic,\" or the lack of human capital.
[When we view]{.underline} the "Negro Question" [as preeminently
ideological, moral, or cultural, we ultimately discount the determinate
role of material contradictions rooted in class
contradictions.]{.underline} As Robert Allen astutely noted, [\" \...
the question is not politics or no politics; rather it is which
politics?]{.underline} Whom will Black Studies serve? [Will it be truly
democratic in its intellectual and political vision, or will it become
\'apolitical\' and acquiesce to a narrow, elitist and bourgeois view of
education?\"]{.underline}26 Black Studies and the Question of Western
Civilization Revisited C. L. R. James wrote what could be considered a
Marxist manifesto for Black Studies in 1969. Speaking at Federal City
College, [James argues, at the level of theory, that Black Studies
should be anti-racist and anti-imperialist in character, but not
anti-white.]{.underline} From James\'s perspective, there is no
intellectual space in Black Studies for philosophies of Blackness in
which ancient African civilizations, values, and cultural perspectives
constitute a \"presuppositionless beginning\" for Black Studies.27 [He
parts company with Black nationalists and their contemporary
progeny]{.underline} (e.g., Afrocentrists) [who argue that every culture
rests on a metaphysical, permanent substratum that gives rise to a
particular system of thought.]{.underline} He cogently proclaims: [We
need a careful systematic building up of historical, economic,
political, literary ideas, knowledge and information]{.underline}, on
the Negro question \... Because [it is only where we have]{.underline}
Bolshevik ideas, Marxist ideas, [Marxist knowledge,]{.underline} Marxist
[history,]{.underline} Marxist perspectives, [that you are certain to
drive out bourgeois ideas,]{.underline} bourgeois history, bourgeois
perspectives [which are so powerful on the question of the races in the
United States.]{.underline}28 \[Italics Added\] For James, [the
antithesis between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology is
essential to the development, direction, and aim of Black Studies. James
is often viewed as someone who was head-over-heels in love with Western
culture]{.underline} and/or civilization. [Yet, it is important to note
that dialectical and historical materialism]{.underline} (or
Marxism-Leninism) [constitutes the conceptual and theoretical framework
for his assessment of \"The Fate of Humanity.\"]{.underline} In a 1939
article, \"Revolution and the Negro\" James boldly avows, \"What we as
Marxists have to see is the tremendous role played by Negroes in the
transformation of Western civilization from feudalism to capitalism. It
is only from this vantage-point that we shall be able to appreciate (and
prepare for) the still greater role they must of necessity play in the
transition from capitalism to socialism.\"29 [James\'s classic
works]{.underline} such as *The Black \]acobins* and *A History of
Pan-African Revolt* [are ardently attentive to the fact that slavery,
colonialism, and imperialism are part and parcel of
capitalism.]{.underline} Moreover, [the revolutionary resistance of
people of African descent ostensibly indicates the critical role of
Black people as actors or subjects of history and the dialectical
development of Western civilization.]{.underline} [In unswerving
disapproval of Hegel\'s views]{.underline} about Africans and their
place outside of world history, [James meticulously documents and
effectively demonstrates that-far from being removed from world
historical event-African people and their descendants in the diaspora
transformed the landscape of world history in a monumental
fashion.]{.underline}3° [Yet, James\'s historiography is not some form
of racial vindicationism]{.underline}, which claims that ancient African
civilization is the real source of Black historic magnitude and
ultimately collective identity. Rather [James offers insights into the
Black struggles against slavery and colonialism as manifestations of the
antagonistic contradictions within the modern]{.underline} (bourgeois)
[stage of world history.]{.underline} Cultural idealism has no place
within James\'s worldview and consequently his philosophy of history.
[James\'s philosophy of history is not anti-European, anti-Western, or
anti-white; his philosophy of history is stridently anti-slavery,
anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and anticapitalist.]{.underline}31 [James
introduces a conceptual distinction between what is European and what is
Eurocentrism.]{.underline} Moreover, [he did not accept the abstract
concept of the West as monolithic, devoid of internal class relations
and contradictory class interests.]{.underline} Black sociologist Alex
Dupuy points out that James\'s dialectical analysis takes into
consideration the tremendous value of European culture and its influence
on the African diaspora, and vice versa.32 Dupuy argues, [\"James was
redefining the meaning of Western culture away from its Eurocentric
understanding.]{.underline} For \[James\], West Indians were a modern
and Western people, though they were not European, a point \[James\]
made in many of his writings, e.g., his semiautobiography, Beyond a
Boundary (1963).\" 33 [James resolutely rejected any outlook that
requires Black Studies to be grounded on a uniquely formulated Black
perspective]{.underline} (e.g., Senghor\'s Negritude or Karenga\'s
Kawaida or Asante\'s Afrocentricity). Dupuy points out that [James does
not \"reject African culture in favor of Western culture.\"]{.underline}
34 Rather, [James\'s analysis is based on \"a historical materialist
understanding of culture\" and the recognition that \"the predominant
influences in the Caribbean were those of Western
Europe.\"]{.underline}35 As Dupuy insightfully notes, \"The Black
\]acobins remains \... one of the most succinct critiques of the
barbarism of Western European imperialism but also of the promise of
bourgeois civilization.\"36 [Any philosophy of AAS worth its salt should
follow in the \"Giant Steps\" of]{.underline} C. L. R.
[James.]{.underline} [Embracing an ethnophilosophy that is anti-European
is as fruitful as masturbation. It may be pleasurable, perhaps even
therapeutic, but it won\'t give birth to a scientific approach to Black
Studies.]{.underline} \"And that Black Fist becomes a Red Spark\" Black
Studies and Black Working-Class Studies37 [In a post-Cold War world, the
\"spectre of communism\" has apparently been exorcised]{.underline} and
laid to rest. [There is the widespread belief that we have witnessed the
death-knell of Marxism.]{.underline} So, [why argue for the legitimacy
of and necessity for Marxism in Black Studies?]{.underline} No doubt
this has been a hotly debated question both in the Black Liberation
movement and in Black Studies for a considerable time. I tend to agree
with Brian Lloyd: \"I presume that [we are witnessing, not the death of
Marxism, but the end of the first period during which Marxists managed
to seize and]{.underline}, for a time, [wield state power.]{.underline}
That it has fewer adherents at the end than during other phases of this
period, and that as many of them can be found in universities as in
factories or fields, is neither disheartening as is imaged by some of
its proponents nor as amusing as is supposed by all of its
detractors.\"38 [It has become the custom to summarily dismiss Marxism
as a viable methodological approach and philosophical perspective for
Black Studies.]{.underline} [Most of the adversarial
postures]{.underline} toward Marxism-Leninism in Black Studies [have
discounted the value of a materialist dialectical philosophy of
liberation, class analysis, class struggle, proletarian
internationalism, and the scientific socialist principle of the
dictatorship of the proletariat.]{.underline} Despite the sharp
divergence of their political views, Harold [Cruse,]{.underline} Cedric
[Robinson,]{.underline} Cornel [West,]{.underline} Marimba Ani, Patricia
[Hill Collins, and]{.underline} Charles [Mills have condemned Marx and
Marxism for everything from economic determinism to class
reductionism]{.underline} to historical teleology and any number of
other \"conceits.\" [We]{.underline} even [find]{.underline} Asante
making such [puerile statements such as]{.underline} the following: \"In
fact, [we have no history of a communist movement in the United
States]{.underline} where communists put their bodies and l.ives on the
line as African Americans did.\"39 Contrary to Asante\'s claim, scholars
such as Mark Naison, Ted Vincent, Erik S. McDuffie, Gerald Horne, Carole
Boyce Davies, Robin Kelley, Minkah Makalani, and Mark Solomon in
addition to autobiographies by Harry Haywood, Hosea Hudson, and Michael
Hamlin offer a much more nuanced picture of communism, socialism, and
Marxism-Leninism in Black life and culture. [Over the years, scholarship
in labor studies and Black Studies has revealed the historical legacy of
Black worker militancy.]{.underline} As we travel through the annals of
Black history, we unearth Peter Clark\'s crucial involvement in [the
Great Railway Strike of 1877,]{.underline} Lucy Parsons\'s unflinching
engagement in [the Haymarket Square struggle,]{.underline} the [heroic
efforts of Ralph Gray, Tommy Gray, Eula Gray, Al Murphy, and scores of
Black sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and agricultural laborers to
organize]{.underline} the predominantly [Black underground
organization]{.underline} the Share Croppers Union, [A. Philip
Randolph\'s tireless efforts with rhe Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters,]{.underline} Ferdinand Smith\'s vanguard role in [the National
Maritime Union and]{.underline} Paul Robeson\'s monumental efforts to
use [folk music to entertain Spanish Civil War loyalists and striking
workers]{.underline} as he gave support to international socialist
solidarity. [We could mention]{.underline} the steadfast leadership of
Velma [Hopkins and]{.underline} Moranda [Smith in the 1947 strike at the
Reynolds Tobacco Company in Winston Salem,]{.underline} North Carolina.
There were Black postal workers like Cleveland Morgan, a member of New
York Branch 36 of the National Association of Letter Carriers, who
played a seminal role in the nationwide 1970 postal wildcat strike. [We
could also mention the historic efforts of the League of Revolutionary
Black Workers to organize wildcat strikes in Detroit]{.underline},
Michigan. [And, in more recent times, we could mention working-class
Black women who have fought against the attack on public
services]{.underline}, such as public housing and welfare. [We should
not ignore the fact that many of these activists were socialists, and
quite a few were Marxist-Leninist in their ideological
outlook.]{.underline} The scholarship of Clarence Lang, John Arena,
Adolph Reed, Barbara Ransby, Rhonda Y. Williams, and Joe Trotter has
demonstrated the historic importance of the Black working-class to
African American history and culture. They bring to light the centrality
of class struggle and conflict as determinate features of what makes up
the Black working-class. [World capitalism gave birth to the Black
working-class.]{.underline} [The initial accumulation of large sums of
capital, which]{.underline} in turn, [was invested in the exploitation
of European workers, derived from the slave trade and the plantation
system]{.underline} in the so-called New World. In volume one of
Capital, [Marx]{.underline} so [famously wrote \"capital comes
dripping]{.underline} from head to foot, from every pore, [with blood
and dirt.\"]{.underline}40 [The ruthless exploitation of Black
bodies]{.underline}, in a manner of speaking, [became the proverbial
goose that lays golden eggs]{.underline}, possessing the magical ability
to increase the magnitude of capital. Incidentally, [the profitability
of the \"proverbial goose\" prompted]{.underline} slaveholder Thomas
[Jefferson to remark, \"it would never do to destroy the
goose.\"]{.underline}41 [Leaving the decks of the slave
ship]{.underline}, \"In the Name of Jesus,\" [large numbers]{.underline}
of Wolof, Mande, Fulani, and Mandingo [were bound together by
chains]{.underline}, from neck to neck and wrist to wrist.42 [Out of the
diversity of African ethnic groups a new synthesis was formed under the
brutal system of capitalist slavery, giving birth to African
Americans.]{.underline} [The incessant \"demand for Black labor\" by
Northern industrial capital and the plantation bourgeoisie fueled world
capitalist development.]{.underline} Black slaves toiled in textile
mills, shipyards, sawmills, and coalmines from Virginia to Mississippi.
[Black women labored on tobacco fields]{.underline} in the Carolina
piedmont and picked cotton on plantations along the coast of Georgia.
Black men like Tom Molineaux and Black women like Sylvia DuBois were
given release time from slave labor in order to engage in athletic labor
(as boxers) to bring entertainment and profits to slaveholders and the
larger white Southern community. 43 From the seventeenth century to the
twenty-first century, from slave plantations to auto factories, Black
women, men, and children labored under the hard times of capitalist
exploitation. [The brutal forces unleashed by the capitalist drive for
surplus value laid the foundation for the development of African
American life and culture, from religion to music.]{.underline}44
[Presently, we are witnessing]{.underline}, from New York to North
Carolina to Missouri to Wisconsin to California, [concerted attacks on
public sector workers in order to resolve the economic crisis ravaging
US capitalism.]{.underline} We cannot ignore the fact that [Black people
are prominent in the leadership as well as in the rank and file in a
great number of these mass demonstrations.]{.underline} In cities
throughout the country, [working-class men and women, Black, white, and
Latino, are being blown away by police officers who are ultimately
protected by the rule of law.]{.underline} [In the aftermath of the
murders of Trayvon]{.underline} Martin, [Michael Brown,]{.underline}
Aiyanna Jones, Yvette Smith, [Rekia Boyd, and Eric Garner, Black working
people are not silently standing by while the \"Lords of Capital\" via
their \"special bodies of armed men\'\' -- with military weapons and
tanks -- confront them in the streets.]{.underline} [This seminal point
is lost on Black critics of Marxism during the past 90
years.]{.underline} As numerous studies in AAS have demonstrated, [the
working-class is not one-dimensional, exclusively composed of white
people.]{.underline} The working-class is composed of women, men, and
children, in addition to being multinational in character. [Marxist
studies of Black working-class life and culture are needed now more than
ever because in the souls of the Black working-class the grapes of wrarh
are filling and growing heavy.]{.underline} As Karl Marx so famously put
it, [\"The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism of
the weapon, material force must be overthrown by material force; but
theory]{.underline} also [becomes a material force as soon as it has
gripped the masses.\"]{.underline}45 Philosophy of African American
Studies, I hope, wilt serve a prolegomena to the Herculean task of
developing a philosophy of AAS from the standpoint of materialism. How
well I have backed up this reaffirmation of philosophical materialism
and revolutionary socialism with good arguments I leave it to my readers
to judge. But the attempt to do so provides an answer-satisfactory to me
at least-to justify writing this book.

Like it or not, [the 2020 presidential election is already starting to
heat up]{.underline}. Progressive Democrats are visiting early primary
and caucus states, while a few old guard Democrats have been testing the
waters since Hillary Clinton conceded to Donald Trump in 2016. But
[while more and more Democrats hope to make President Trump a one-term
White House resident, the astute ones will take note of one factor that
played a decisive role in the GOP's grabbing a larger Senate majority in
the 2018 midterm elections: support for Israel]{.underline}. During the
recent midterms, if you got all your news from the old guard press, you
likely were unaware that support for the Jewish state was an important
issue. By contrast, [readers of new media outlets were well informed of
far-left Democrats running for Congress who were clearly anti-Israel or
even blatantly anti-Semitic]{.underline}. Operating a decade behind the
times, mainstream media outlets tend to think the Israel issue is moot
because Jewish voters overwhelmingly vote Democratic regardless of their
views on Israel. What the mainstream media fail to realize is that
support for [Israel is extremely important to millions of Christians,
especially Evangelicals]{.underline}. [The organization that had perhaps
the biggest impact this past Election Day is Christians United for
Israel, through its legislative arm, CUFI Action Fund. With over 5
million members, CUFI is the largest pro-Israel organization in the
United States. But what also sets them apart is that their members can
be counted on to show up at the polls and cast their ballot for the
candidate that is best for the Jewish state]{.underline}. [Judging from
states with Democratic incumbents that went GOP this past election, it
is clear that support for Israel can be a game changer]{.underline}. In
Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott defeated longtime incumbent
Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for the Senate. Nelson supported the Iran
nuclear deal, which remains to this day extremely unpopular among
supporters of the Jewish state. CUFI has over 270,000 members in the
Sunshine State. These reliable voters know exactly who supported the
Iran deal and who ultimately has Israel's back. From a media
perspective, the Israel issue was a bigger deal in Florida's
gubernatorial race. Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum (D) lost his bid for
the state's highest office to former Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis.
DeSantis criticized Gillum for supporting the Black Lives Matter
offshoot Dream Defenders, a group that supports boycotting the Jewish
state and has a history of working with convicted terrorists and the
terror organization Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Even
though Gillum denied that he supports the Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, his support of Dream Defenders
was arguably enough to sink his campaign. CUFI Action Fund was most
active in North Dakota. While they do not endorse any candidates, by
Election Day, North Dakota voters had received a thorough education via
television ads that incumbent Democrat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp supported the
Iran nuclear deal. Before those ads began running, Heitkamp was in a
tight race with her opponent, Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer. By election
night, she was a double-digit loser. States such as Missouri and Indiana
that saw their blue senate seat turn red on election night also have
significant CUFI membership. [Organizations such as the Republican
Jewish Coalition made sure voters in key races knew the Democratic
candidates' positions on Israel. \"The Republican Jewish Coalition
invested in independent expenditures in three important races (in
Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Dakota)---and Republicans won all
three,"]{.underline} said Executive Director Matt Brooks in a statement.
[The Cook Political Report credited the RJC for turning PA-1 from
toss-up to lean Republican after they educated voters on Democrat Scott
Wallace's family foundation supporting boycotts against Israel to the
tune of \$300,000]{.underline}. Democrat Leslie Cockburn in VA-5 was a
media darling in a race that opinion poll analysis website
FiveThirtyEight deemed a toss-up. But the RJC made sure voters knew her
anti-Israel history that included authoring the 1991 book Dangerous
Liaison: The Inside Story of the U.S.-Israeli Covert Relationship, which
the New York Times characterized as "Israel bashing for its own sake,"
adding that its message was that Israelis "are a menace" responsible for
"everything that ails us." She ultimately lost by a significant 6.6
percent. "[With approximately 50 events nationally per month, CUFI's
field staff is in constant education mode. That's all they do and it
never stops, whether it's an election year or not]{.underline}, because
the message always matters," explained CUFI Action Fund Chairwoman Sandy
Hagee Parker. "What makes us unique," Parker reflected, "is that CUFI
members don't see Israel as a political issue, but as an exercise in
their faith -- and that will never change."

Last week, Rick Jacobs was pushed, shoved and, according to
eyewitnesses, threatened with mace near Jerusalem's Western Wall. Jacobs
is the head of America's largest Jewish denomination, the Union for
Reform Judaism. The fact the altercation between security guards
sanctioned by the Israeli government and a group of Reform Jews led by
Jacobs did not merit a media sensation or public opinion maelstrom is
testament to how desensitized we have become to the ongoing clash
between Israel and a large segment of liberal American Jews -- Reform,
Conservative and nonpracticing alike. It shows how quickly one can get
used to living with an ongoing disaster. Most American Jews I've met
recently cannot hide their anger or anguish. They may not be a
representative sample of American Jewry per se, but they certainly
represent involved Jews who would have never dared talk about Israel and
its leaders the resentful way they do today. [Years of pent-up criticism
of Israeli policies and lack of pluralism burst out into the open
following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision in June to renege
on the Kotel deal that would have expanded egalitarian prayers at the
wall and given American Jews a role in running the place. A dam that had
been holding back feelings and frustrations burst out, so a crisis took
hold.]{.underline} Though five months have passed, [many Reform and
Conservative leaders haven't completely come to terms with Netanyahu's
capitulation to an ultra-Orthodox demand to "freeze" the January 2016
Kotel deal.]{.underline} As if the government going back on its word
wasn't bad enough, Reform and Conservative leaders were flabbergasted by
Netanyahu's initial indifference to the controversy he had created, and
by his chutzpah in trying to blame them for the ensuing crisis. Many
were still incensed last week when Netanyahu suggested -- in a video
appearance at the Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly
in Los Angeles -- that a modest physical upgrade of the current small
and isolated area designated for egalitarian prayer near the Western
Wall would suffice to cool the crisis and calm the restless Jews of
liberal America. Many Israelis wonder why Reform Jews get so worked up
about women praying together with men in the first place, given that
they don't do so in almost all Israeli shuls, which are predominately
Orthodox. But they miss two crucial points. The first is that [for
Reform leaders to now accept the exclusion of egalitarian prayers from
the Kotel is tantamount to collaborating with the Israeli/Orthodox
establishment's designation of them as "second-class Jews," whose
rituals do not deserve a place near Judaism's holiest site.]{.underline}
[The second is that while many of them have been bending over backwards
to try and maintain a semblance of unified support for Israel, despite
widespread reservations over its government's policies, Netanyahu made
fools of them by reneging on a deal that took years to hammer out and in
which they invested their personal prestige]{.underline}. [And then he
has the temerity to lash out at the movement's leaders for feeling
betrayed]{.underline}. Netanyahu's disdain exacerbated an already
difficult situation. [Reform and Conservative Jews in particular, and
liberal and progressive American Jews who want to support Israel in
general, have for years been having a tough time clinging to the old
Israel right-or-wrong philosoph]{.underline}y of organized American
Jewry. In addition to dealing with the denial of recognition of Reform
and Conservative Jews since the state's inception, [liberal Jews have
also had to rationalize Israel's right-wing/Orthodox
government;]{.underline} its nationalist/populist crackdown on dissent;
the Netanyahu corruption allegations and his governing coalition's
assault on the rule of law; and, perhaps first and foremost, 50 years of
occupation. If you add to this mix widespread liberal anger at
Netanyahu's defiant March 2015 speech to Congress and the far more
intense mortification of his enthusiastic embrace of U.S. President
Donald Trump -- who most, though far from all, American Jews despise --
you get a powder keg ready to explode. Netanyahu then turning his back
on a deal he negotiated and that his cabinet approved was like him
lighting a match right near the fuse. [There is a direct correlation, of
course, between the ups and downs of Netanyahu's maneuvers around the
Kotel deal and his analyses of the political winds in the United
States.]{.underline} [When he originally concluded the Kotel deal in
January 2016, Netanyahu was acutely aware of his need to patch up
relations with liberal Jews in the wake of his bad relations with
then-President Barack Obama]{.underline} and his Iran deal speech.
[Given the plausibility that Hillary Clinton would succeed Obama,
Netanyahu had to quickly mollify potential-supporters-in-time-of-crisis
in the Jewish community, so he could mobilize them to lobby Congress
against a hostile Clinton administration, when it became necessary. When
it became clea]{.underline}r on November 8, 2016 that it wasn't Clinton
but [Trump]{.underline} who [was]{.underline} being
[elected]{.underline}, and that it isn't liberal Jews who are going to
have the president's ear but devout evangelicals, [the Kotel deal's fate
was sealed]{.underline}. If Clinton had been elected, Netanyahu would
have either faced down ultra-Orthodox demands to nix the Kotel deal or
found other ways to appease them. With Trump in the White House and
Netanyahu's hubris reigning supreme, Reform and Conservative Jews
suddenly became expendable. [From that point onward, their protests and
criticism melded in with the chorus of all those Netanyahu views as his
personal enemie]{.underline}s. Through the warped prism of his
~~paranoia~~, Netanyahu probably saw the demand that he stand up to the
Haredi parties on the Western Wall issue as part of a conspiracy aimed
at destabilizing his coalition and toppling his government. [Critical
American Jews were inducted, in absentia, into Netanyahu's version of
the deep state that's out to get him -- which already includes lefties,
journalists, intellectuals, artsy types, police investigators, state
prosecutors, Supreme Court judges, Obama, George Soros and, lest we
forget, the New Israel Fund]{.underline}. Some of the damage done to the
ties between Israel and liberal American Jews in recent years is
irreparable. In households that are already struggling with progressive
young Jews either flocking to non- or anti-Zionist groups, or simply
distancing themselves from Israel altogether, the disenchantment with
Netanyahu's Israel -- before and after the Kotel deal -- translates into
a lack of pushback. By placing Israel in direct confrontation with the
most basic liberal tenets of most American Jews, Netanyahu is depleting
their energy to defend Israel to their surroundings. The parents may
still rally around in time of need, but their children are so far away
by now, they will probably never return. If we cling to the political
yardstick, perhaps there is room for some optimism about a potential and
at least partial reconciliation in the near future -- if one assumes
that Netanyahu, who fancies himself a savant on U.S. politics, has
internalized the results of the recent elections in Virginia and
elsewhere. Placing all your eggs in the Steve Bannon basket, as
evidenced by the report that Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer feted the
former White House adviser at his official residence, does not sound
like such a great idea if the Democrats are about to stage a
congressional coup in next year's elections and take control of the
House of Representatives. The danger may not be clear and present just
yet, but it should certainly give Netanyahu second thoughts about
burning all his bridges to his potential defenders. Most of the Jews I
speak to would like nothing better than to put all of this behind them.
Netanyahu has painted himself into a corner now and may very well be
unable to defrost the frozen Kotel deal altogether -- but he could
certainly do more to thaw relations with American Jews and to
acknowledge their grievances. But if there is to be any hope of slowing
or reversing the growing gap between Israel and a big chunk of the
largest Jewish Diaspora community, Netanyahu is probably not the man to
realize it. Between reneging on the Kotel deal and fawning over Trump,
the bad impression Netanyahu has left on many American Jews in recent
months is one that will never go away.

#### Palestinian support would destroy dems political campaigns

**Moone 18** (Morgan Moone, Associate Editor for Law at the Margins.
"Palestinian Progressives," 9/25/7.
<http://lawatthemargins.com/09252018-palestinianprogressives/>, DA:
1/30/19, MT)

According to Omar Baddar, deputy director of the Arab American
Institute, [it is "conventional wisdom that you cannot criticize Israel
in American politics." For years, pro-Palestinian sentiments and
non-violent struggle for Palestinian human rights have been viewed as
overt acts against Israel and have been largely decried.]{.underline}
Progressive politicians are trying to change that. The recent shift in
the political environment after the rise of Bernie Sanders, emerging
democratic socialists, and the election of Donald Trump has pushed the
boundaries of traditional social platforms, creating room for
politicians to voice support for Palestinians. Ilhan Omar and Julia
Salazar, both newcomers to the larger political arena who ran successful
campaigns, raise questions as to whether politicians sympathetic to
Palestine are increasing not only in popularity, but also in political
viability. With so much at stake for pro-Palestinian politicians, the
question becomes: [can a pro-Palestinian, BDS-supporting politician be
politically viable? Politicians have traditionally been forced into, or
refused to fight against, lukewarm sentiments towards Israel that are
not consistent with reality]{.underline}. Bernie Sanders, for example,
received overwhelming support and praise when he stated that the United
States should "treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity,"
despite the statement's absurdly low bar in terms of civil and human
rights attainment. Sanders was unsurprisingly called out for his
statements by pro-Israel groups. Despite the backlash, Bernie remains as
popular as ever. Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, stated: "Not too
long ago, if a politician expressed sympathy for the Palestinians, they
would be cooked. But hardcore Berniecrats are changing all of this."
[While vocally supporting Palestinian rights is slowly becoming a point
of valid debate, politicians seeking to be viable candidates are still
chastised for taking concrete actions that may make attainment of
Palestinian rights a reality. Politicians across the board have been
admonished and even lost elections because of their ties to the Boycott,
Divest and Sanction movement]{.underline} (BDS) [or opposition to
overwhelming military aid.]{.underline} "For a long time, the American
left has fallen short on supporting Palestinian rights. White Americans
on the left have consistently tried to keep discussions about Palestine
out of leftist discussions." -- Suzanne Adely United States [support of
Israel has been so unwavering and foundational to US politics that it
seeps into every aspect of political life and those who attempt to
deviate from the rhetoric risk political unviability.]{.underline} In
March, [a meticulously documented UN report detailing Israeli treatment
of Palestinian people was removed from a United Nations website after
direct pressure from the United States]{.underline}. It also prompted
the resignation of the leader of the UN agency that had issued the
report. On the other hand, Ireland has divested itself of Israeli goods
produced in the West Bank and the European Union has passed measures to
label similar goods. [In the United States, politicians who seek to
assert their support of Palestine risk their careers.]{.underline} Last
year, democratic Florida State Sen. Dwight Bullard lost his seat for
re-election after his opponent drew attention to his ties to BDS. After
traveling to Palestine, he spoke out on behalf of what he saw there.
"What I found most disheartening was the dismissal of some of the
injustices I witnessed as "staged" or "made up".... As an
African-American I know all to well what it is like to feel a sense of
oppression in the place I was born in." His support for the Palestinian
cause, he states, "was not meant to disparage any one group, but to
encourage empathy for people (Palestinians) looking for freedom in their
own land." Daniel Bliss, running for governor as a democrat in Illinois,
replaced his running-mate after his candidate for lieutenant governor
refused to back down from supporting the Palestinian cause. Virginia
democrat Leslie Cockburn took a hit in her campaign when a book she
authored criticizing Israel-US relations came to light. Similarly, in
2016, Congressman Keith Ellison was vying for chair of the Democratic
National Convention (DND). He was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and had the
support of Chuck Schumer, the current Senate minority leader and a
strong supporter of Israel. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a
pro-Israel advocacy group, said Ellison was unfit to chair the DNC
because he had stated that American foreign policy in the Middle East
should not be driven by Israel. D[ays before the vote, DNC members
received an email saying"Electing Keith Ellison would send the wrong
message. I urge you to consider instead a candidate who will unify the
party, bring in Independents, and continue our strong tradition of
maintaining a robust US-Israel bond."]{.underline}

[One Democratic House candidate has pledged that she will vote against
bills that include aid to Israel]{.underline}, denouncing what she saw
as the "injustice" of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. Another
wrote that "Israel has hypnotized the world" with its "evil doings."
Still another helped write a scathing book on relations between the
United States and Israel, while [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]{.underline},
a progressive political star expected to win a House seat in New York,
[condemned the "occupation of Palestine." A cluster of activist
Democrats]{.underline} --- most of them young, most of them cruising
toward House seats this fall --- [has dared to breach what has been an
almost inviolable orthodoxy in both political parties, strong support
for Israel, raising the specter of a crack in the Democratic Party that
Republicans could use to attract Jewish supporters]{.underline}. Surging
support for the Palestinian cause has already strained relations between
liberal parties and Jewish voters in Europe. In Britain, the Labour
Party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been accused of anti-Semitism for a
pro-Palestinian stand that has veered into statements that many see as
outright bigotry. Across the United States, movements to force colleges
and universities to boycott, divest investments from and place sanctions
on Israel have divided some progressive students from their Jewish
peers. Now [some Democrats are testing the boundaries of what has been
the politically acceptable position on Israel in the mainstream
parties.]{.underline} They include Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American Muslim
running for an open House seat in Minneapolis; Rashida Tlaib, a
Palestinian-American Muslim running in Detroit; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez,
running in a heavily Democratic district in the Bronx and Queens; and
Leslie Cockburn, co-author of "Dangerous Liaison: The Inside Story of
the U.S.-Israeli Covert Relationship," who is running in a
Republican-leaning district in Virginia. None of them would comment for
this article. They have not made their views on Israel a central issue
of their campaigns, but they also have not held back. Ms. Tlaib, in an
August interview with the liberal magazine In These Times, endorsed a
one-state solution that could jeopardize Israel's status as a Jewish
state. "It has to be one state," she said. "Separate but equal does not
work." Ms. Omar, who had criticized Israel's "evil doings" in 2012, was
accused on Twitter of anti-Semitism after her campaign got underway.
"Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating
Jews," she responded. [Against a backdrop of a White House that has
taken a series of measures explicitly targeting
Palestinians]{.underline} --- moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem, slashing aid and most recently, closing the Palestine
Liberation Organization office in Washington --- [the group's stances
are at odds with several prominent pro-Israel party leaders, setting up
an interparty conflict often waged over generational lines. Republicans
have already lobbed charges of anti-Semitism]{.underline}. "I do worry
that there are some on the extreme left of our party who adopt slogans"
that are creating tensions, said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat
of California and a pro-Israel voice in the party. Editors' Picks Where
518 Inmates Sleep in Space for 170, and Gangs Hold It Together Forget
the Suburbs, It's Country or Bust After More Than Two Decades of Work, a
New Hebrew Bible to Rival the King James Others dismissed the newcomers
as a fringe, with little influence. "[We're talking about a handful of
people; they're certainly not going to move Congress's wall-to-wall
support for Israel,"]{.underline} [said Ron Halber, the executive
director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater
Washington.]{.underline} "Could it turn into a ripple? Perhaps. You have
a unique combination of forces right now." [His greater concern, he
said, is that President's Trump's friendly relationship with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is getting Israel's narrative
"caught up in the anti-Trump fervor, which is not fair to
Israel]{.underline}." Running on platforms that emphasize opposing
discrimination against marginalized groups, candidates have introduced
the Palestinian issue as what they call a larger commitment to social
justice. "It's a position consistent with all their other values," said
Dima Khalidi, the director of Palestine Legal, a Palestinian rights
group. "You cannot take positions on social justice issues, on the
border wall, on immigration rights, without addressing the injustices of
the Israeli occupation." Ms. Tlaib said in a television interview that
she would "absolutely" slash military aid to Israel, adding, "I will be
using my position in Congress so that no country, not one, should be
able to get aid from the U.S. when they still promote that kind of
injustice." "Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far
from hating Jews," Ilhan Omar, a Democrat running for a House seat in
Minneapolis, wrote on Twitter after her previous comments were called
anti-Semitic.CreditStephen Maturen/Agence France-Presse --- Getty Images
Pro-Israel groups like StandWithUs are concerned that anti-Israel views,
promoted and masked by "human rights language," will find "a landing
space in our political system," said Peggy Shapiro, the group's Midwest
executive director. "On the far right it's easier to spot," Ms. Shapiro
said of hateful language. "On the far left we have a more complicated
challenge because misinformation is often expressed in the language of
social justice, and it makes it easier to mislead well-meaning people."
[Party leaders and Democrats supportive of Israel have largely remained
silent on the issue]{.underline}. Neither Senator Chuck Schumer of New
York, the Senate minority leader, nor Representative Nancy Pelosi of
California, the House minority leader, responded to requests for
comment. Representative Gene Green, a centrist Democrat from Texas,
conceded that "the last few years it's been a little tougher" to find
members of his party as supportive of Israel as he is. [But he
attributed Ms. Omar's and Ms. Tlaib's comments to a zeal to represent
their districts, which he noted have large communities of Middle Eastern
immigran]{.underline}ts. "Democrats, we have broad stripes," Mr. Green
said, adding that he expected that within the party "you'll still see
support for Israel." But those candidates' leanings appear to align with
a broader consensus among Democratic voters. Two years ago, Democrats
were more likely to sympathize more with Israel than with the
Palestinians by a 14 percentage point gap, according to a Pew Research
Center poll. In January, the same poll showed that gap had shrunk to two
points. Matthew Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish
Coalition, accused Democratic leaders of failing to push back against
"hostile" remarks from Democratic candidates. "That involves policing
and enforcing their own and making clear that these views are outside
the mainstream," he said. "So far they haven't done that." But
[Republicans are not averse to exploiting the Democratic divisions. The
Republican Jewish Coalition purchased a \$530,000 ad campaign in June
accusing Scott Wallace]{.underline}, a Democrat running in
Pennsylvania's First Congressional District, [of
anti-Semitism]{.underline}. Mr. Wallace ran an organization that
dispensed more than \$330,000 in grants to boycott, divestment and
sanctions groups; Mr. Wallace has disavowed the movement and said he did
not exercise authority over those funds. [The Republican Party of
Virginia has laid into Ms. Cockburn, calling her a "virulent
anti-Semite]{.underline}," a charge she hotly contests[. In California,
Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican under indictment on charges
of campaign finance violations, is trying to tar his Democratic
opponent,]{.underline} Ammar Campa-Najjar, with a grandfather who
masterminded the 1972 terrorist attack on Israeli Olympic athletes in
Munich. Israeli commandos killed Mr. Campa-Najjar's grandfather long
before Mr. Campa-Najjar was born. The liberal Jewish group J Street
condemned that effort on Wednesday as "one of most ugly, racist campaign
ads we've ever seen." Ron DeSantis, [the Republican nominee for Florida
governor, has accused his Democratic opponent, Andrew Gillum, of having
ties to anti-Israel groups]{.underline}, citing financial support he
received during his primary race from Dream Defenders, an organization
that backs boycotts, divestment and sanctions, and a speech Mr. Gillum
gave two years ago at a Muslim advocacy event welcoming the Council on
American-Islamic Relations to Tallahassee. Mr. Gillum denies supporting
the boycott-and-divest movement. "Anyone trying to use Israel as a
political wedge and football doesn't have Israel's best interest at
heart and should be ashamed of themselves," said Representative Debbie
Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, calling the accusation
"revolting." [Republicans say they will continue to push the issue. "The
fact that this is allowed to metastasize in the Democratic Party without
any real pushback,"]{.underline} Mr. Brooks said, his voice trailing
off. "[It used to be one of the third rails of politics, especially in
the Democratic Party."]{.underline}
