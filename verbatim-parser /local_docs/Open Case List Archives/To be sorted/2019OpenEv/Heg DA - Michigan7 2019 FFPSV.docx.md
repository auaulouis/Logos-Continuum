## Notes

This file is designed to be pieced together with the Defense Industry,
Russia, and China DAs that have already been put out and the hegemony
good file that FFPSV is putting out with this one. The goal is to have a
small 1NC with a link argument that makes both fill-in arguments, has
DIB internals, and a heg impact. The block can then take advantage of
2AC deficiencies by building up scenarios about the DIB (weakest), China
(okay, depending on the aff), and/or Russia (strongest, depending on the
aff).

Thanks to the awesome debaters who put this together

### UQ -- US Sales Up

#### Sales are up 

**Mehta 2018** - Aaron, \"The US brought in \$192.3 billion from weapon
sales last year, up 13 percent,\" Nov 8,
https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/11/08/the-us-brought-in-1923-billion-from-weapon-sales-last-year-up-13-percent/

[Combined weapon sales from American companies]{.underline} for fiscal
2018 [were up 13 percent]{.underline} over fiscal 2017 figures, [netting
American firms \$192.3 billion,]{.underline} according to new numbers
released Thursday by the State Department.

The department previously announced that FY18 brought in \$55.66 billion
in foreign military sales, an uptick of 33 percent over FY17's \$41.93
billion. Through the Foreign Military Sales process, the U.S. government
serves as a go-between for foreign partners and American industry.

What had not been released until now is the [total direct commercial
sales, the process through which foreign customers can directly buy
systems from industr]{.underline}y[. Those figures topped \$136.6
billion]{.underline} for FY18, a 6.6 percent increase from FY17's
\$128.1 billion.

### UQ -- US -- Japan Alliance

#### The Japanese-American military alliance is stronger than ever

**The Economist 18** \[The Economist; Japan is worried about its
alliance with America; The Economist; 09-06-2018;

**[THE]{.underline}** control tower at **[Iwakuni air
base]{.underline}** near Hiroshima gives a bird's-eye view of the huge
facility shared by American marines and Japan's Maritime Self-defence
Force, as the country's navy is euphemistically known. [The marines'
F-35 fighter jets roar into the sky from a runway below. Hangars nearby
house state-of-the-art Japanese seaplanes.]{.underline} In the past
decade or so the base [**has expanded massively**. It is now one of the
biggest for American military aviation in the Asia-Pacific, with about
5,000 troops working alongside 1,500 Japanese personnel.]{.underline}

[Iwakuni has long been a rare example of a base in Japan that is jointly
used by both countries]{.underline}. And **[developments at Iwakuni show
how security ties between Japan and America are
strengthening]{.underline}**, [say Colonel Richard Fuerst and
Rear-Admiral Yoshikazu Morita, the base's most senior officers from the
two countries.]{.underline} They say **[American marines in Iwakuni
train more often with Japanese forces than they did a few years ago.
Closer co-operation is also evident at other military facilities in
Japan, whether it is fighter pilots conducting more frequent air drills
together or desk-warriors training for cyber conflict]{.underline}**.
Dennis Blair, a former chief of American forces in the Pacific who is
now at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, an American think-tank, says
**[the military relationship is closer than ever.]{.underline}**

That is fortunate for [Japan.]{.underline} It [feels the need for
American protection more than ever]{.underline}. [China still nurses
grievances relating to the Japanese invasion in the 1930s and 1940s, and
has a bitter dispute with Japan over islands in the East China Sea.
Chinese military strength is growing fast and the country appears eager
to displace America as the region's hegemon. Meanwhile North Korea has
been deploying nuclear weapons that can strike anywhere in Japan. And
Japan has yet to a sign a treaty with Russia to end the second world
war. Officials in Tokyo worry about massive military
exercises]{.underline} that are due to take place [in]{.underline}
[Siberia]{.underline} next week, involving Russian and Chinese forces
(see Europe section).

#### Japanese officials are watching Trump nervously -- the Japanese-American alliance is under high tension

**The Economist 18** \[The Economist; Japan is worried about its
alliance with America; The Economist; 09-06-2018; https://outline.com/
//Brower\]

At the same time, **[the alliance between Japan and America is under
unprecedented stress, mainly because of]{.underline}** America's
president, **[Donald Trump]{.underline}** (pictured with Japan's prime
minister, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo last November). [There are worries in
Tokyo that Mr Trump might strike a deal with North Korea's leader, Kim
Jong Un, that protects America but leaves Japan exposed to a North
Korean attack. **Japan has been feeling largely sidelined during the
recent high-level diplomacy surrounding North Korea's
nukes**]{.underline}. [Indeed, Katsuyuki Kawai, an adviser to Mr Abe,
describes the Trump-Kim summit in June in Singapore as a wake-up call
for Japan. After the meeting, Mr Trump announced a suspension of
exercises with South Korea and aired the idea of withdrawing American
troops from the Korean peninsula]{.underline}. "We have decisively
entered a new security environment," says Mr Kawai.

Few observers go quite that far, but **[Japanese and American officials
wince at Mr Trump's casual raising of doubts about his commitment to
allies and about his belief in the global economic order that has
allowed Japan to prosper]{.underline}**. They still prefer not to air
their worries publicly. For example, Taro Kono, the foreign minister,
praises the alliance as "stronger than ever". He points to the personal
rapport between Mr Abe and Mr Trump, who has spent more time talking to
Japan's prime minister than to any other country's leader. On February
14th the two men spoke by telephone for more than an hour about North
Korea and other matters. Mr Kono jokes that having such a long chat on
Valentine's Day is something he would not do with his wife.

Yet in private **[some Japanese officials say that Mr Trump unnerves
them when he says that America is being taken advantage of by other
countries, including allies, and that he resents spending so much on
deployments abroad]{.underline}**. [Japan-hands in America say he does
not seem to understand that the 54,000 American troops in Japan are
there to defend not just Japan, but also American primacy in the
region.]{.underline}

Most imminently, **[a storm is looming over trade. Mr Trump is obsessed
with America's trade deficits, and one of its largest is with
Japan.]{.underline}** It was nearly \$70bn last year (see chart). Mr
[Trump wants a deal with Japan that could oblige it to reduce tariffs on
agricultural imports**. Japan is resisting.**]{.underline} It says that
Mr Trump should look not just at trade but also at the scale of Japanese
investment in America. Japanese firms make 3.8m cars there annually,
more than double the number they send to America from Japan.

But [Mr Blair, the former Pacific forces chief (who also served as
President Barack Obama's director of national intelligence), describes
Mr Trump's refusal to exempt Japan from his tariffs on steel and
aluminium as "a dress rehearsal" for things to come]{.underline}.
**[Unlike China, Japan has refrained from retaliating against Mr Trump's
assaults on free trade. But if America applies tariffs of 25% on cars,
as he has threatened, Mr Abe would find it hard not to respond in
kind.]{.underline}** Japan's exports of cars to America have doubled in
the past six years, to \$40bn. **[Extra tariffs on them could be an
embarrassment too far for Mr Abe, on top of the humiliation he has
already suffered as a result of Mr Trump's Japan-neglecting diplomacy in
the region.]{.underline}**

**[Japan and America have had squabbles in the past, but security and
trade have been kept apart.]{.underline}** Now Mr **[Trump appears ready
to exploit military ties as bargaining chips in economic
affairs]{.underline}**. [Japanese officials have watched nervously how
he has used his country's previously rock-solid alliance with South
Korea as leverage in trade talks, and how he has threatened not to
defend allies in NATO that fail to boost their military spending. Mr
**Trump has moaned about the cost of keeping American troops in South
Korea. That makes officials in Tokyo wonder whether he feels the same
about American bases in Japan. "What happened to NATO will sooner or
later come to us,"** says Ryozo Kato, a former Japanese ambassador to
Washington.]{.underline}

#### Japanese foreign policy is departing from America

**The Economist 18** \[The Economist; Japan is worried about its
alliance with America; The Economist; 09-06-2018; https://outline.com/
//Brower\]

Few observers believe there will be an alliance-rending rupture between
Japan and America. But Mr **[Trump's unpredictability is prompting
Japan's leader to step up his efforts to fashion a more independent and
assertive foreign policy]{.underline}**. [This has included mending
fences with its big neighbours. Since Xi Jinping, China's leader, and Mr
Abe met on the sidelines of a regional summit late last year, the tempo
of official exchanges between China, the world's second-largest economy,
and Japan, the third-largest, has increased]{.underline}. Mr
[Abe]{.underline} will visit Beijing in October, the first trip to
China's capital by a Japanese prime minister in seven years. He [has
also been trying to improve relations with Russia, despite territorial
disputes that still cause rancour.]{.underline} On September 10th he
will visit Vladivostok to attend an economic forum. While there he is
likely to meet Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and possibly also Mr
Xi.

Mr [**Abe's most striking departure from American foreign policy has
been in the realm of trade. He has disregarded Mr Trump's contempt for
the T**rans-**P**acific **P**artnership**, a free-trade deal that was
close to being concluded when Mr Trump decided America would no longer
be part of it**]{.underline}. Mr Abe persuaded the ten remaining
would-be members of the pact to reach a deal anyway. He is now urging
them to speed up ratification of it. In July, after years of tortured
negotiations, **[Japan signed a separate pact with the EU, creating the
world's biggest bilateral free-trade area]{.underline}**. Mr Abe hailed
it as a move against global protectionism---a dig at Mr Trump. **[Japan
is working hard on another trade deal, the Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership. This would involve the ten members of ASEAN and
several other countries.]{.underline}**

#### Japan is militarizing now and securing other alliances 

**The Economist 18** \[The Economist; Japan is worried about its
alliance with America; The Economist; 09-06-2018; https://outline.com/
//Brower\]

In the security realm, **[Japan sees no real alternative to its reliance
on American protection.]{.underline}** Indeed, Mr **[Abe has been trying
to strengthen military ties with America by introducing legislation that
gives Japan's armed forces---though still constrained by a pacifist
constitution---more leeway to help allies globally.]{.underline}**
(Though he will be anxious to avoid casualties. When he sent
peacekeepers abroad last year, Mr Abe pledged to resign if one were
killed.)

**[Japan is cultivating other military partners as well.]{.underline}**
For example, [it is keen to bolster co-operation among members of the
so-called Quad, an evolving security partnership between Japan, America,
Australia and India. It is also talking to NATO and individual European
countries, especially Britain and France, about strengthening defence
ties. Last month it sent three destroyers to South-East Asia to
reinforce military relationships in that region, too.]{.underline}

[**Japan is also trying to beef up its defences.** In August it launched
a new destroyer equipped with American anti-missile weapons. It plans to
install a new onshore anti-missile system by 2023. It also says it will
buy air-launched cruise missiles that analysts say could be used against
North Korea, as well as more American-made F-35 fighter
jets.]{.underline} **[The ruling Liberal Democratic Party says it wants
to boost defence spending to 2% of GDP, the target set by
NATO]{.underline}** (though it is unfulfilled by many members). Japan
spent 0.9% of GDP on defence in 2017, compared with an average of 1.3%
among European members of NATO and 3.1% in America.

Such efforts should please Mr [Trump]{.underline}, who [complained
before he became president that if America were attacked, Japan could
"sit home and watch Sony television".]{.underline} **[America has long
been urging Japan to spend more on its armed forces and give up its
inhibitions about deploying them to places where they might be shot
at]{.underline}**. But at least **[as long as Mr Trump remains
president, Japan will worry about its friend's
reliability]{.underline}**. "[We have had spats before, but always with
the understanding that both parties were committed to the alliance and
needed to come out content," says Mr Blair. Officials on both sides are
unsure whether that understanding remains.]{.underline}

#### Japan already feels abandoned by America

**Miura 19** \[Lully Miura; Lecturer at the Policy Alternatives Research
Institute (PARI) of the University of Tokyo; In the time of Trump, Japan
is looking to defend itself; South China Morning Post; 01-13-2019;
https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2181764/how-trump-forced-japan-take-security-its-own-hands
//Brower\]

A decade or so from now, [people may look back on 2019 as a turning
point for Japan the moment it finally came to terms with its own
security in the 21st century.]{.underline}

**[Two years of the Donald Trump administration in the United States
have shaken the Japanese public]{.underline}**, [but after a bit of
shock, they have accepted a new reality. **This is a post-Iraq-war world
and Japan,**]{.underline} for the first time since the end of the second
world war, **[is facing the challenge of providing for its own
security.]{.underline}**

In the quarter century since the end of the cold war, which did not
conclude with a \"peace dividend\" for East Asia, Japan has had to cope
with the changing times. [Throughout the 1990s, its alliance with the US
was redefined, and Tokyo has had to confirm that such an alliance is
still relevant. It has also sought to normalise its security policy
while continuing its pacifist tradition. The ability to send its Self
Defence Forces to peace missions overseas, and exercise collective
self-defence with the US, were important steps during this
period.]{.underline}

But **[Japan is now facing the sobering reality that its security
environment has changed, more so than the incremental steps it has so
far taken towards bolstering its defences would suggest.]{.underline}**

Asia has faced its fair share of security challenges in the past from
the Soviet military build-up of the 1950s and 1960s, to China becoming a
nuclear power in 1964 and the North Korean nuclear crisis that still
rumbles on to this day - but none of these crises changed the
fundamentals of East Asian security, since the US\' relative military
superiority and resolve were never in question.

So long as the region could count on US commitment, other factors were
of secondary concern.

**[What has changed in the Trump era is American resolve. His emergence
within the Republican Party, mirrored on the left by a renewed
enthusiasm for disengagement within the Democratic Party is a clear sign
of shifting priorities in the US over whether to maintain its informal
\"empire\" overseas]{.underline}**

[Of course, America will not simply turn over its worldwide dominance to
China. Its recent focus on pressuring China economically, and rebuilding
its technological pre-eminence, are clear signs that it doesn\'t intend
to do so.]{.underline} From a security perspective, the US\'
modernisation of its nuclear arsenal, investments in artificial
intelligence and cybersecurity, and honing in on space warfare are all
signs of its imperial resolve. But that doesn\'t necessarily translate
into regional hegemony in East Asia.

[Talks between the US and North Korea have also signalled a symbolic
change to US foreign policy in the region**. US appeasement towards
Pyongyang has been met by feelings of disappointment and helplessness in
the Japanese media, especially when Trump mentioned Japan as one of the
main cost bearers of denuclearisation, despite no concrete agreement
having been made once again, Japan would be paying for something it has
little influence over.**]{.underline}

The country finds itself in an awkward position, as it has no offensive
capabilities to draw concessions out of North Korea, yet [the US does
not share its fear of Pyongyang. Tokyo can only attempt to influence the
situation by influencing the US.]{.underline}

The talks have also exposed a more fundamental issue: **[the gap in
perceptions between Tokyo and Washington regarding their alliance. The
Trump administration embodies a distrust of Japan as a \"free-rider\"
that does not contribute enough towards its own defence.]{.underline}**
This is not a view widely shared in Japan at all. [The Japanese public
is more afraid of \"entrapment\" by the US and becoming tangled up in
its wars.]{.underline} **[This perception gap exists because the
Japanese public have largely been shielded from the realities of the
alliance by a government that has feared being abandoned by the US, but
did not want to broadcast its hospitality towards the superpower for
fear of a pacifist backlash.]{.underline}**

In the two years since Trump came to power, [the Japanese public have
become increasingly sceptical of US support in the case of a limited
crisis, such as one involving the disputed Diaoyu Islands, which Japan
calls the Senkaku Islands.]{.underline} **[Japanese
progressives]{.underline}**-both in opposition and in the media -
**[have become more isolationist. They are keen to weaken the alliance,
but not necessarily build up independent military
capabilities.]{.underline}** Neither do recent progressives see China
favourably, compared with the cold war period.

[In the same way Japan is wary of the US, it is also wary of South Korea
given their historical issues, with ties fraying again now because of a
disagreement over wartime labour compensation.]{.underline}

The conservatives in power, meanwhile, are gradually adapting to a new
reality. **[Japan has reinforced its military relationships with others,
such as the members of the Quad, and plans to boost defence spending
over the next five years with advanced military equipment from the
US.]{.underline}**

Yet these guidelines, while championing resilience and self -
sustainability, also continue with the basic philosophy of pacifism.
[The remaining years of the Trump era are likely to see Japanese society
further torn between isolationism and realism.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON, DC \-\-- [[Arms transfers are a]{.underline}]{.mark} central
[[**pillar** of America's]{.mark} **international [security
cooperation]{.mark},** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} they are also [[an
important part of the]{.mark} **American
[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This dual role as a tool of both
foreign policy and economic security --- combined with the unique nature
of the goods and services involved --- makes arms transfer policy
uniquely complex.

Recognizing these factors, the U.S. government oversees and manages our
defense trade unlike any other sector of the export economy. At the
heart of this process is the State Department's Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, supported by the Department of Defense. The
bureau vets each potential sale against legal, regulatory and policy
standards through the rubric of the president's Conventional Arms
Transfer Policy.

The new Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, which President Donald Trump
approved in April 2018, lays out a comprehensive set of considerations
that must be taken into account in reviewing every potential arms
transfer. While the policy is designed as a practical framework for such
decisions, it can also be read as an explanation of the potential
benefits of these transfers for our national security and global
security.

Well-considered [**[arms transfers]{.mark}** can bolster the
**security** of the United States and our allies and
partners.]{.underline} [Examples include [defend]{.mark}ing [against
**external coercion** and provid]{.mark}ing [capabilities in]{.mark}

**[terror]{.mark}ism**, [**trafficking** an]{.mark}d **transnational

Economics and Energy [Russia's]{.underline} energy and [economic
assets]{.underline}---comprising oil and gas sales, [other trade and
investment,]{.underline} e[mbargoes and cutoffs, remittances, and tariff
and currency manipulation---provide important weapons in Moscow's hybrid
toolkit. These economic assets can be employed alone, or in concert with
other economic, military, and political tools such as military force,
**arms sales**, and economic coercion.]{.underline} Russia's energy
policy is closely aligned with its national security strategy given the
state's high dependency on energy exports for government revenues. In
particular, Russia has regularly manipulated energy chains to exert
economic pressure and territorial influence.

APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE Weitz APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 23 Russia
has shown a proclivity to use energy contracts, proposed pipelines, and
supply manipulation to influence post-Soviet countries. For instance,
after invading Ukraine, the Russian government quickly seized all
Ukrainian energy production and storage facilities. This seizure's
purpose was to deprive Kyiv of revenues generated from the transit of
energy through the country and, therefore, pressure it into accepting a
more pro-Russian disposition. In addition, Russia was able to gain vast
tracts of maritime zones and land to locate more natural gas. Moscow is
still trying to isolate Ukraine from other European sources of energy
and render it wholly dependent on Russian gas and oil. Furthermore, the
energy coercion has been accompanied by a campaign of economic warfare
against Ukraine that includes high tariffs, embargos, and delays of
imports designed to shape other Ukrainian policies to Moscow's benefit.
Moscow also can also manipulate remittances of foreign workers working
in Russia as well as the threat to expose foreign corruption.

Recommendations [Hybrid tactics are most effective when the target state
has lost the will or capacity to resist. Conversely, countries that do
not have these vulnerabilities face little threat from Russian
adventurism short of full-scale war. The most prevalent indicators or
"signposts" that an entity is vulnerable to Russian hybrid actions
include political and social turmoil, large Russian investments in its
key capabilities, and weak security structures.]{.underline}
Fundamentally, the United States must reevaluate old paradigms that
separate war and peace in the wake of current international conflicts.
Institutional and analytical changes are essential for enhanced
strategic awareness. Strengthening Western institutions and civil
society to build resilience against hybrid threats is imperative.

[US responses should prioritize]{.underline} robust cyber defenses,
[situational awareness, flexibility, and deterrence at the strategic,
operational, and even tactical levels.]{.underline} The United States
must adjust quickly to the changing strategies of Russian information
operations, specifically the study of Russian Reflexive Control
techniques. Western governments should raise standards for transparency
and integrity in research, advocacy, lobby groups, and "Track II"
diplomacy; encourage Western groups to expose and challenge Russian
propaganda and disinformation, whether conducted by the Russian
government overtly or through intermediary institutions; and assist
Western institutions to sustain dialogue and collaborative research with
free-thinking Russians in ways that do not make them vulnerable to
Russian internal security laws. [Counterstrategies against Russian
influence and information operations used in the Cold War may prove
effective if modernized. Western responses must strive to be as
extensive and multifaceted as Russian soft power
initiatives.]{.underline}

[In terms of preventing Russian subversion, preemptive "target
hardening" through political, social, and economic measures can make it
more difficult for Moscow to undermine a state]{.underline}. Bolstering
governance and legitimacy can deprive Moscow of soft targets and
opportunities for subversion. Western governments and international
organizations can share best practices for eliminating corruption,
reducing ethnic tensions, increasing cyber defenses, and resisting
information warfare.

[Economic objectives are important in Moscow's outreach to the rest of
Africa.]{.underline} Since at least March 2014, when the West sanctioned
Russia over its illegal Crimea annexation, Moscow looked outside the
West for economic opportunities. [Putin also understands Africa's
enormous potential, and as such stated that "Africa cannot be on
periphery of international relations]{.underline}" (RIA Novosti, 2016).

[Moscow seeks the continent's natural resources in addition to energy
and **arms sales**]{.underline}. But political objectives are also tied
closely to economic ones. [African countries are a large bloc within the
UN General Assembly, and three African countries are on the UN Security
Council. Additionally, Russia's outreach within Africa cannot be
entirely separated from Moscow's Middle East objectives. The Horn of
Africa allows power projection into the Middle East.]{.underline} The
Gulf of Aden provides influence over the Suez Canal. Oleg Ozerov,
Russian Foreign Affairs ministry's deputy director for Africa and
ambassador to Saudi Arabia noted recently that African countries
requested Russian assistance after observing Russia's "success in
counterterrorism operations in Syria" (Valdai Club, 2018). When Sudanese
President Omar al-Bashir met with Putin in November 2017, Syria was
among their discussion topics, showing how the Kremlin works multiple
angles in its diplomacy. The Syria factor mattered because, among other
issues, Putin is working on rehabilitating Assad, and Bashir is helpful
in achieving that end, especially since most recently, Bashir became one
of the first Arab leaders to visit the Syrian dictator ("Sudan's
President Bashir asks Putin", 2017; "Sudan's president is first Arab
APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE Borshchevskaya APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE
64 leader", 2018). That Bashir stepped down in mid-April of this year as
a result of massive protests is important, but doesn't take away from
the broader point of Putin working to leverage corrupt, authoritarian
African leaders, if not war criminals, to achieve his own aims.

[Just as in the Middle East, in Africa, Moscow seeks a powerbroker role
and to sideline Western influence, while the region's autocratic rulers
welcome a fellow authoritarian's support. In addition, the anti-Western
undercurrent in Russia's outreach to Africa seems to have a receptive
audience in the region beyond autocratic rules. Russia was never a
colonial power in Africa, and the region's perceptions of Russia in
terms of racism and prejudice issues]{.underline} (including its Soviet
predecessor) likely do not correspond with Russia's more grim reality in
this regard. Here too, soft power matters. Historically the Russian
Orthodox Church has had a relationship with Ethiopia's Monopysitic
church. (Matusevich, 2007). More recently, Moscow has been trying to
attract white South African farmers to come to Russia, playing on
Putin's image as a protector of "traditional" values against what the
West describes as the immoral, degenerate West (Ferris-Rotman, 2018).

[neither China nor Russia factor in]{.mark}to their sales **end-use

While China and Russia will continue their efforts, the US intends to
remain the global partner of choice for defence co-operation. America's
allies know that acquisition of our defence systems brings
state-of-the-art capabilities with attractive industrial partnership
opportunities.

[[To **ensure**]{.mark} **America's [global
leadership]{.mark},**]{.underline} and to improve alignment of
conventional defence trade policies with his national security strategy
and the national defence strategy, Mr [[Trump is **reforming US
policies**]{.mark} and **procedures**]{.underline}. [The **new rules**
will reflect the **demands** of today's **global threat
environment**]{.underline}. [This policy change has been
**codified**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} two strategically integrated
[reforms]{.underline} announced in April.

[One reform updates the US policy on]{.underline} unmanned aerial
systems, known as **[drones]{.underline}**. The other better aligns
conventional arms transfers with US goals. Together, [these changes
**emphasise** the administration's enthusiasm for **arms exports** that
are in the interests of **national security**]{.underline}, foreign
policy and economic security.

One key tenet of Mr Trump's policy is that "[economic security **is**
national security]{.underline}". The administration believes that
responsibly [[**expanding defence exports** will **strengthen**
the]{.mark} US's **manufacturing** and **[defence industrial
base]{.mark}**, [while **strengthening partnership**]{.mark}
**opportunitie[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} with allies.

Key [[**security** **alliances**]{.mark} such as **Nato**
[benefit]{.mark} greatly [from the ability of forces to be
**interoperable**. **Strong**]{.mark} **US
[exports]{.mark}**]{.underline} and common Nato standards [[allow
our]{.mark} armed [forces to work together to
**deter**]{.mark}]{.underline} and defend against **[common
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [When the US transfers weapons
systems]{.underline} --- the most technologically sophisticated and
effective in the world --- [[our]{.mark} **friends** and [**partners
become more capable** and]{.mark} our **regional [alliances]{.mark}**
[become more **integrated**]{.mark}, stable and secure]{.underline}.
[This **reduces the cost** to US taxpayers of **defending critical
interests.**]{.underline}

On the economic front, [[a **vigorous**]{.mark} **US [defence export
policy]{.mark}** [means **more jobs**]{.mark} for American workers in
**aerospace** and advanced manufacturing, which offer strong wages and
attractive career opportunities]{.underline}. Higher defence sales will
also help reduce the more than \$500bn-a-year trade deficit, a massive
and persistent burden that represents an unacceptable transfer of
American wealth, jobs and manufacturing capacity.

By staying at the forefront of global defence exports, [the US will also
**ensure** that **respect for human rights** and **international norms**
are **important considerations** in **any arms sale.** The departments
of state]{.underline}, defence and commerce [will continue to play their
traditional roles in balancing such respect with the security
considerations I have outlined.]{.underline}

Our international allies should be encouraged by American leadership in
this area. The [Trump]{.underline} administration [is]{.underline} fully
[invested]{.underline} not just in the success of US defence exports but
also [in the more **stable** and **secure alliances** such exports will
**support**.]{.underline}

Russia's position in Latin America and the Caribbean in the past five
years has weakened considerably, due largely to a political shift to the
right across the region]{.underline}. [That shift has been deepened and
sustained, ironically, through the negative political and economic
example of the populist-socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela (which
Russia helped to sustain in power). Outside of Venezuela, such changes
include the replacement the pro-Russian Peronist regime of Christina
Fernandez de Kirchner by the pro-market government of Mauricio Macri in
Argentina's October 2015 elections. The expulsion of Christina and her
leftist-Peronist government substantively froze Argentina's courtship of
Russia]{.underline}, which had included consideration of the purchase of
Russian Su-24 fighter aircraft, oil deals, nuclear power collaboration,

Russian advances and set the stage for an investigation of corruption

returning to power center-right businessman Sebastian Pinera. In the
process, it ended Chile's cautious exploration of military ties with
Russia, begun by outgoing President Michelle Bachelet, who had been

Russia's most significant activities in Latin America in recent years
arguably center on the nation's three principal enduring strategic
partners: Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba, although Russia has also
suffered significant setbacks in each of these relationships during the
period. [Venezuela, under the socialist governments of Hugo Chavez and
Nicholas Maduro, has been the partner that has most permitted Russia to
use its territory and resources to advance Russian strategic objectives.
From 2006 until Venezuelan resources began to run out, coinciding with
Chavez' death (officially in March 2013), Venezuela bought over \$11
billion in arms from Russia, including Su-30 fighter aircraft, Mi-35
attack helicopters, Mi-17 transport helicopters, T-72 tanks, BMP and BTR
armored vehicles, and a range of other equipment]{.underline} (Ellis,
2015). On three separate occasions, [Venezuela allowed (perhaps
encouraged) Russia to operate nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers out of its
country]{.underline} (in 2008, 2013, and 2018), and [in 2008, Russia
deployed warships to Venezuela. In 2008 and 2013, Venezuela allowed
Russia to establish a military airbase on La Orchila island, just off
the Venezuelan coast and in close proximity to the United
States.]{.underline} The Russian oil company Rosneft has loaned an
estimated \$6 billion to the Venezuelan national oil company PdVSA and
has invested billions more in the country. It has helped to shelter
Venezuela from the effect of US sanctions by making its Vadinar refinery
in India available to refine Venezuelan oil, as an alternative to using
US Gulf coast refineries. Russia also sent mercenaries to Venezuela in
December 2018 and allowed the Venezuelan oil company PdVSA to relocate
its offices from Lisbon to Moscow. Russia also joined China in February
2019 in blocking a United Nations resolution that might have facilitated
a UN peace enforcement force to help the legitimate government of Juan
Guaido consolidate his physical control over Venezuela (Schwirtz, 2019).

Russia's help to Venezuela has not always produced the hoped-for
results. Its arms sales to Venezuela were significantly curtailed when
Venezuela ran out of money. Four of Russia's five oil companies pulled
out of Venezuela due to bad experiences there (Lukoil, TNK, Gazprom, and
Surgutneftegaz). PdVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned energy company, has
fallen behind in its payments to Russian energy producer Rosneft. Making
matters worse, Rosneft is likely to be prevented from taking control of
the downstream oil company CITGO, offered by PdVSA as collateral for a
\$1.5 billion loan. With the deepening crisis in Venezuela, Nicaragua
has expanded in value as a partner for Russia in the region. Building on
Nicaragua's previous relationship as a client state of the Soviet Union
from 1979-1990, when former communist president Daniel Ortega and his
Sandinista party returned to power in 2007, Nicaragua endeared itself to
Moscow by recognizing the pro-Russian separatists in South Ossetia and
Abkhazia during the 2008 Georgian civil war. In the decade which
followed, Russia provided Nicaragua food supplies, busses and other
donated goods, as well as T-72 tanks, armored vehicles, patrol boats,
and missile boats to upgrade its military, a police training center in
Managua, and an antenna-laden GLONASS satellite downlink facility
(suspiciously close to the US embassy in Managua). Nicaragua also signed
an agreement facilitating access by Russian warships to its ports, as
well as allowing Russian Tu-160 bombers to land in the country (in the
process violating Colombian airspace) while visiting the region in 2013.

While Cuba's relations with Russia were strained due to the latter's
abrupt withdrawal of financial support following the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991, Russia bought some goodwill by forgiving \$30
billion of the island's outstanding \$35 billion in cold-war era debt.
Russian companies have been involved in Cuba's nickel and petroleum
industries, and committed to construction projects involving
thermoelectric plants, an airport and the Mariel port. Russian firms
also sold or donated cars and other vehicles to Cuba, and explored
renovating the Cienfuegos refinery (and possibly even completing Cuba's
cold war-era Juragua nuclear power plant). Nonetheless, despite
proclamations of interest from Russian legislators, Cuba has not led
Russia resume use of its Cold-War signals APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE
Ellis APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 79 intelligence facilities in Lourdes,
Bejucal, or Santiago de Cuba (for monitoring the US), nor has it bought
significant quantities of Russian military equipment or participated in
all of the occasions since 2008 in which Russia has deployed military
assets to the region. Cuba has, however, permitted some visits by
Russian warships (including the docking of the signals collection ship
Leonov in Havana Harbor in February 2014 when the US was negotiating
with Cuba to restore diplomatic relations).

[Beyond these key partners, with respect to military engagement, Russia
has leveraged previous sales to Peru (beginning under the regime of
General Juan Velasco Alvarado and continuing with Mig-29 sales during
the administration of Alberto Fujimori), to sell the country Mi-17s,
Mi-35s, and other equipment and support packages, although in at least
one case]{.underline} (regarding replacement of Peru's aging BM-21
self-propelled rocket launchers), Russia lost out to a Chinese
competitor selling its Type 90B system. Russia has also signed a
military cooperation agreement with Suriname.

#### Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico are ripe for Russian influence -- any decrease in US influence is another opportunity for Russian fill-in

Likely Future Russian Activities in Latin America [For the moment,
Russia appears likely to continue its principally reactive set of
political and military activities in Latin America, and limited economic
engagement. The most likely sources of near-term change may come from
the evolving situations in Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, and
Guatemala,]{.underline} as well as through expanded cooperation with the
PRC in the region.

[In Venezuela, US-led military intervention]{.underline} (including a
multi-national force responding to a breakdown of order), [could lead
Russia to opportunistically join Cuba in supporting elements of the
military and collectivos that remain loyal to Maduro]{.underline}, and
attempt to wage a protracted guerilla campaign against the Guaido
government (per Cuban doctrine adopted by the Venezuelan military), as
well as support other criminal groups resisting the imposition of order,
including the ELN, FARC dissidents, and "sindicatos" in the Venezuelan
interior, among others.

In Cuba, consolidation of power by Miguel Diaz-Canel, including the
eventual retirement of Raul Castro from leadership of the Communist
Party, in combination with a continued hard line from the US, could lead
the regime to finally permit an expanded Russian defense presence,
including possible APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE Ellis APPROVED FOR PUBLIC
RELEASE 80 base access agreements or renewed use of SIGINT facilities
such as Lourdes, Bejucal, and Santiago, in ways the Cubans have been
reluctant to do thus far.

[In Nicaragua, successful elimination of dissidence by the Ortega regime
could pave the way for renewed Russian engagement,]{.underline}
currently operating at a low profile coinciding with the political
crisis that began in April.

[In Guatemala, following the constitutional crisis]{.underline} between
the government of Jimmy Morales and his Supreme Court over the UN
anti-corruption body CICIG, [the June 2019 elections could bring a new
leftist government to power that embraces a more active Russian
presence]{.underline} (de Leon, 2018).

[In Mexico, frustration by the leftist AMLO government over US rhetoric
and policies]{.underline} regarding a border wall, migrants and US
failure to ratify the new USMCA trade deal [could lead AMLO to more
fully embrace both China and Russia as counterweights to the
US.]{.underline} While Russia has little to sell, loan to, or invest in
Mexico, it could engage in expanded symbolic defense interactions such
as institutional visits, officer training in Russia, Russian training in
Mexico, or joint exercises. [With respect to arms sales, AMLO's
cancellation of purchases of US Blackhawk helicopters could open the
door for it to do more work with the Russians in upgrading its
Mi-17s.]{.underline}

#### Russia is attempting to increase arms sales in Latin America

Latin America accounted for 4.6 per cent of total Russian arms exports
between 2000 and 2016. More than 80 per cent of these shipments
consisted of supplies to Venezuela, supplemented by modest volumes of
exports to Peru and Brazil. The regional arms market tends to be
dominated by European and US suppliers, or by domestic suppliers, as is
the case in Brazil, the largest military spender in the region (see
Figure 10). The relatively [small volume of military spending across the
region, as well as a tendency among the majority of its countries to
enjoy close political ties with the US and Europe, means that the
prospects for expanding Russia's markets outside Venezuela appear bleak.
However, that has not stopped Rosoboroneksport from trying, with efforts
under way to market small warships, helicopters, submarines, missiles
and fighter aircraft across the region]{.underline}.67 \[Graph Omitted\]
Venezuela has the fifth-largest defence budget in the region.68 It has
bought a wide range of weapons systems from Russia in recent years,
including BMP-3, BTR-80A and T-72 armoured vehicles, air-defence
systems, and Mi-8MT/Mi-17s helicopters. However, Russia's entrenched
position in the Venezuelan market faces two threats. First, the future
of Venezuela's defence budget is uncertain due to the extreme economic
difficulties afflicting the country. Most of Venezuela's arms purchases
from Russia were funded from the boom in hydrocarbon prices in the early
2000s. However, after two years of relatively low oil prices, Venezuela
has experienced a severe recession, which is likely to restrict the
government's ability to continue spending on military procurement.
Second, Russia has faced increasing competition from China in recent
years: indeed Chinese suppliers accounted for 90 per cent of Venezuelan
arms imports in 2015.69

Israel

[Since]{.underline} the Olmert visit to Moscow in October
[2006]{.underline}, [Russian-Israeli relations continued in
their]{.underline} ~~schizophrenic~~ [erratic course]{.underline}. Thus,
[on the eve Bashar al-Asad\'s visit to Moscow in August
2008]{.underline}, Russia\'s new president, Dmitry [Medvedev, and
Israeli Prime Minister]{.underline} Ehud [Olmert had a telephone
conversation. They discussed]{.underline} Israeli-Syrian relations and
the situation in Georgia; [trade between Russia]{.underline} [and
Israel, which now exceeded \$2.5 billion a year]{.underline}, much of it
in the high-tech sector; cultural ties including a Moscow-established
cultural center in Tel Aviv, a visa-waiver agreement to facilitate
tourism, [and the return to Russia of czarist property in
Jerusalem]{.underline}; and an agreement between Israel\'s Kadima and
Putin\'s United Russia parties to establish party-to-party relations.
3\" While some in the Russian military, such as Deputy Chief of Staff
Anatoly Nogovitsyn publicly complained about Israeli aid to the Georgian
military,31 [Foreign Minister Lavrov went out of his way to praise
Israel]{.underline} [for stopping arms sales to Georgia]{.underline}.32

[What then explains Russia\'s continued bifurcated policy toward
Israel,]{.underline} and how will the Russian invasion of Georgia affect
it[? It appears clear that Russia has three goals vis-à-vis Israel.
First, Israel is]{.underline} [the homeland of more than a million
Russian-speaking citizens]{.underline} of the FSU [whom Russia sees as a
**source of its global influence**]{.underline}. Hence, the emphasis on
cultural ties, in which Israelis of Russian origin play the dominant
role. [Second]{.underline}, as noted above. **[Putin is determined to
develop the Russian economy; and high-tech trade with
Israel]{.underline}**, especially in the area of nanotechnology,33 [**is
a part of his plan**.]{.underline} [Third, the Arab-Israeli conflict is
a major issue in world politics, and **Putin would very much like to
play a role in its diplomacy**, if not in resolving it]{.underline}. For
this reason, he continued to call for an international peace conference
in Moscow and wanted Israel to attend, [so as to demonstrate the abilitv
of Russia to be a world mediator.]{.underline}

By early 2009, perhaps in an effort to convince Israel to attend a
Middle East peace conference, and perhaps because it was growing
increasingly disenchanted with Flamas, Moscow took a rather evenhanded
view of the Israeli-Hamas war of December 2008-January 2009, instead of
giving strong backing to Hamas. Moscow also praised the long-delayed
August 2009 Sixth Fatah Congress, with Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Andrei Nesterenko asserting, \"The restoration of Palestinian
unity on the PLO platform and on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative
is an integral part of lasting peace.\"34 Putin, now Russia\'s prime
minister, although considered by most analysts to still be Russia\'s
most powerful leader, had even more explicit praise for Fatah in his
greetings to the Congress: \"Fatah, the core of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, steadily defends the interests of Palestinians,
primarily their right to form a sovereign and viable state.\"55 Hamas
denounced the Fatah Congress.

[In May 2009, Israel\'s new foreign minister]{.underline}, Avigdor
[Lieberman]{.underline}, himself an immigrant from the FSU, [announced
during a visit to Russia that Israel had agreed to attend the
international peace conference in Moscow, long desired by Putin. He also
called for a strategic dialogue with Russia. This may have been the
price Moscow was demanding for holding off on the delivery of SAM-300
missiles to Iran as well as sophisticated missiles and military aircraft
to Syria. Lieberman was followed to Moscow by both]{.underline} Israeli
President Shimon [Peres and]{.underline} Israel\'s new prime minister,
Benjamin [Netanyahu, who were evidently concerned that Russia was about
to consummate the sales]{.underline}.\*\'\' Perhaps as a further
incentive for Moscow, [Israel agreed to sell reconnaissance
drones]{.underline}, something Russia very much needed, given the poor
performance of its surveillance equipment in the Georgian war.\"
[Meanwhile, Russia was having difficulty managing its position on the
Arab-Israeli conflict, as was made clear by Moscow\'s flip-flop over the
Goldstone Report,]{.underline} which condemned both Israel and Hamas for
actions taken during the Israeli invasion of Gaza. In the UN Human
Rights Committee, Russia - seeking to win Arab support - voted to
approve the report, which had been bitterly criticized by Israel.
However, [in the General Assembly vote to send the report to the
UN]{.underline} [Security Council, Moscow abstained]{.underline},
perhaps wishing [to assuage Israeli anger]{.underline} or, perhaps,
because it might itself be accused in international fora of killing
civilians during Russian military operations in the North Caucasus.

[The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is the second-most important
region for Russia's arms exports]{.underline}, and accounted for 17.8
per cent of the total between 2000 and 2016. This market comprises
traditional customers such as Iraq (1.4 per cent of exports), Syria (1.4
per cent), Egypt (1.4 per cent) and Yemen (1.2 per cent), as well as
newer markets such as Algeria (9.1 per cent), Iran (2 per cent) and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) (0.7 per cent). [However, competition in the
region is much more intense than in Asia,]{.underline} with Russia
responsible for a relatively modest 18.3 per cent of all arms sales in
2000--16. As illustrated in Figure 8, [Russia is dominant in Algeria,
Iran, Syria and Yemen, and the rapidly shifting geopolitical environment
in the region means that new opportunities may emerge. Algeria accounted
for over half of Russian arms exports]{.underline} to the region between
2000 and 2016 (see Figure 9). It [was also the third-largest overall
market for Russia's weaponry]{.underline} (behind only India and China),
accounting for 9.1 per cent of exports. Since 2000, Algeria has acquired
armoured vehicles (T-90S), fighter aircraft (Su-30MKA), missiles (SA-10
and Kh-31M) and submarines (Varshavyanka-class).60 One of the largest
arms deals between Russia and Algeria, signed in 2006, was part of a
larger commercial deal that included Russia writing off \$4.5 billion of
debt, access for Russian firms to Algeria's oil and gas reserves, and
the construction later of a T-90 assembly plant in Algeria (a deal
signed in 2015).61 Russia has sought to increase its share of the MENA
arms market, where it was strong during the Soviet period. There have
been setbacks, though. The removal from power of clients such as Saddam
Hussein in Iraq (2003) and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya (2011) caused
considerable losses for Russian arms firms.62 Moreover, the arms embargo
placed on Iran in 2007 froze what was a burgeoning arms relationship.
However, [in the past year or so there has been a resurgence in interest
in Russian weaponry across the region, whether because of its perceived
effectiveness in combat in Syria or because Russia is more willing than
Western countries to sell it to countries such as Iran and
Syria.]{.underline} The sale of the S-300 air-defence system to Iran,
which had been delayed by the imposition of sanctions on Iran, has
finally taken place, and there is speculation that Iran will purchase
Su-30SM fighter aircraft.63 [Efforts to penetrate markets recently
dominated by US and European suppliers have also begun to bear
fruit]{.underline}. In 2014, Russia agreed a multi-billion-dollar deal
to supply attack helicopters and MiG29 fighter aircraft to Egypt.64 This
was important because Egypt has relied on the US for arms since the late
1970s. Russia has also supplied attack helicopters and air-defence
systems to Iraq, and there is speculation that the latter will purchase
fighter aircraft in the future.65 [There have even been rumours that
Russia might be able to carve out a position in Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, the region's largest buyer of weaponry, [although
this is a market traditionally dominated by US and European
suppliers]{.underline}, reflecting Riyadh's close political
relationships with the US and European governments.66 However, Russia's
support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria may complicate its
efforts to forge closer arms ties with countries like Saudi Arabia that
are actively supporting his opponents.

[During the past two centuries, the United States has enjoyed a largely
unchallenged geopolitical, economic, and social influence in Latin
America. However, in an increasingly multipolar world, Russia and
China-and Iran to a lesser extent-have emerged to fill the vacuum left
by diminished U.S. engagement in the region.]{.underline} Each with
different interests, these three foreign actors exploit a growing,
widespread disillusionment towards the United States. This regional
disillusionment coupled with endemic corruption, violence, and erosion
of the rule of law marks the conditions under which the extra-regional
actors are engaging Latin America. [All three actors have made
significant gains-and suffered important setbacks-as they move
aggressively to **position themselves as alternatives to traditional
U.S. hegemony** in Latin America. Their success has not been total, nor
has it gone completely unchallenged. However, their efforts are a new
constant in the Western Hemisphere, as the United States increasingly
pursues an agenda that is sharply divorced from the once-shared
interests of the majority of the region\'s governments.]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin has made no effort to hide his desire
to reestablish his country as a viable power player and competitor to
U.S. influence]{.underline} in the region. [Viewed through the lens of
the Gerasimov Doctrine, this engagement is both rational from the
Russian perspective and **dangerous to the** United States. So far,
Russia has primarily focused its outreach efforts on allies in the
Bolivarian Alliance, led by Venezuela and including Cuba, Nicaragua,
Bolivia, El Salvador, and Suriname, all of whom share a strong anti-U.S.
ideology with each possessing deeply criminalized
governments]{.underline}.1 [Often operating as a sort of \"parasite
state,\" the public outreach of the Putin regime in Latin America is
designed to maximize impact at low cost. To date, this approach consists
largely of weapons sales and donations, high level state-to-state
visits, military and police training in areas of U.S. specialization
such as counternarcotics, and financial assistance in avoiding the
U.S.-based banking system.]{.underline} Within international forums,
Russia has used its seat on the UN Security Council to protect Venezuela
and Nicaragua from international sanctions, and has aggressively moved
to open up financial operations-including banks and a crypto currency-to
help its allies blunt the impact of U.S. and EU sanctions. The Russian
presence, increasingly accompanied by Russian organized crime groups
operating under the protection of the Russian state, is viewed by most
U.S. stakeholders as presenting the biggest strategic challenge of the
three countries discussed. In comparison to Russia, China is primarily
an economic competitor, actively seeking to expand its areas of
influence globally. [China\'s outreach has been much broader across
Latin America where it has sought to build long-term economic
relationships with any willing partner in the region. China\'s growing
regional presence is focusing on trade and on increasing diplomatic ties
at the expense of]{.underline} the Republic of China
([Taiwan]{.underline}), [while presenting itself as a global superpower
capable of providing military training, business opportunities and
unconditional foreign assistance in a more reliable, long-term way than
the United States]{.underline}. Rather than wooing only the Bolivarian
bloc and ideological allies, [China engages across the region, recently
convincing Panama and the Dominican Republic, key U.S. allies, and El
Salvador to drop their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. In exchange,
both received large amounts of aid and promises of investment from the
People\'s Republic of China]{.underline} (PRC). Of the three external
actors, Iran\'s revolutionary government has the smallest footprint in
Latin America of the three countries and the most opaque agenda. Unlike
Russia and China, [Iran]{.underline} offers neither economic nor
military support, but instead [focuses on a narrower set of state and
non-state actors through limited political outreach and illicit
activities meant to further Iran\'s national interest and nuclear
program. That influence diminished with the death of former Venezuelan
president Hugo Chávez and the end of the presidency of Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad in Iran, but may increase again contingent upon current
developments]{.underline}. Prior to the January 2016 implementation of
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreed to by Iran and the
West, the Iranian government maintained an active network in Latin
America to purchase dual use equipment for its nuclear program, and
sought to build close partnerships with the Bolivarian bloc of nations
that were belligerently anti-U.S. in tone and focus.2 Iran used the
Bolivarian banking structures to evade sanctions, along with its primary
allies: Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Attempts at a
rapprochement with Argentina ended in 2016 with the end of the Kirchner
government, and ties to Brazil in the past decade have fizzled. Upon the
initial implementation of the JCPOA, the visible Iranian presence in
Latin America dropped significantly, although the infrastructure of the
clandestine network remained in place. That network appears to be
reactivating again in possible anticipation of the likely collapse of
the JCPOA in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from the pact. Closely tied
to the Iranian government\'s formal structures are the Hezbollah-linked
networks that engage in widespread criminal activities, such as
contraband, money laundering, and drug trafficking needed to finance the
Iranian proxy force.

Impact of Changing Regional Dynamics Because Russia and Iran tied their
Latin American agendas to the nations of the Bolivarian Alliance, the
state of their relationships and relative importance in the region have
mirrored that of their allies. During the ascendance of the Alliance in
the early years of the 21st century, Chávez, Putin, and Iran\'s
president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made several joint appearances to
celebrate regional electoral victories. The three nations announced
grand plans and joint projects that would cost billions of dollars and
herald the dawn of the Alliance\'s motto: \"Socialism for the 21st
Century.\" The strategic alliance produced an alternative to the United
States on every front including economic aid, military training,
equipping and doctrine, large-scale investment, and geopolitical
orientation. The years since 2016, however, have seen a dramatic
weakening of the Bolivarian Alliance. Powerful Alliance
members-including Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil-left the alliance,
while other members- including Nicaragua and El Salvador-continue to
experience major domestic challenges. As a result, Russia and in
particular Iran, have far fewer willing partners in Latin America than
even a few years ago. China, playing a long game founded on pragmatism
rather than ideology, has not seen the same downturn in influence and
relationships as have Russia and Iran. By decoupling its economic and
outreach agenda from an explicitly anti-U.S. message, China has been
able to work across the region without significant opposition. While
China has bailed out the Maduro government in Venezuela to keep it from
default and has allowed Ecuador to accrue a massive debt, it has also
maintained cordial ties with Colombia, Peru, and other U.S. allies. As
noted above, since March 2017 Panama, El Salvador, and Dominican
Republic dropped their historic recognition of Taiwan and recognized the
PRC, leaving only 18 countries in the world that recognize Taiwan.3 The
constant in the new regional dynamic is that the United States, less
engaged in the region and no longer the sole external influence, is not
driving ebbs and flows of the influence of the extra-regional actors in
Latin America. Rather, it is a dynamic largely driven by the Latin
American nations\' perceived self-interests at any given time. The
permanent presence of Russia, China, Iran, and others who are setting a
proactive rather than reactive agenda means a new normal in Latin
America. Growing Russian Influence in Latin America [As Russia seeks to
both expand and deepen its regional ties, the seminal Gerasimov Doctrine
provides the framework for understanding the Russian strategy and
tactics aimed at weakening U.S. influence, challenging U.S.
dominance-military, economic, and political-and establishing a
multipolar world order. As Commander of U.S Southern Command, Admiral
Kurt W. Tidd outlined in his February 2018 Posture Statement to the U.S.
Senate Armed Services Committee: Russia\'s increased role in our
hemisphere is particularly concerning, given its intelligence and cyber
capabilities, intent to upend international stability and order, and
discredit democratic institutions]{.underline} . . . Left [unchecked,
Russian access and placement could eventually transition from a regional
spoiler to a critical threat to the U.S. homeland]{.underline}.4 This
Russo-Bolivarian partnership has opened the door not only for political
and economic influence but also for; the expansion of Russia\'s
state-linked media to blanket the continent with an anti-U.S.,
pro-Russia propaganda via Sputnik News, Russia Today (RT TV), and other
outlets; [the installation of intelligence gathering platforms in close
proximity to the United States, including numerous satellite tracking
stations; and multiple commitments to nuclear expansion in the
Hemisphere.]{.underline} In addition to the shared desire to minimize
U.S. influence in the region, Russia\'s expanded outreach to the
Bolivarian bloc provides a powerful friend on the UN Security Council
capable of vetoing any efforts to hold them accountable for human rights
violations or electoral fraud. In addition to establishing strong
traditional diplomatic relations, [Russia is also now deeply engaged in
activities helping its allies to; develop new cyber capabilities,
including cyber-attacks and hacking; expand the sophistication and reach
of surveillance equipment, mostly used against political enemies and
journalists; participate in joint maneuvers and multiple military
exercises; and purchase more sophisticated weapons systems that generate
revenue and enhance Russian influence while diminishing that of the
United States.]{.underline} As part of this partnership, Russia has
worked closely to prop up the Maduro regime in Venezuela both
financially-through the advance purchase of increasingly scarce oil,
coupled with debt forgiveness-and politically, by blocking sanctions and
punitive measures in the United Nations and other international forums.
The Putin government also enjoys a special rapport with its former
revolutionary allies in the region, particularly those in Nicaragua and
El Salvador. These nations have only grown in importance to Russia in
recent years, particularly as the security and economic situation in
Venezuela deteriorates and compromises its status as a reliable ally. In
Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega\'s long-standing ties with the former
Soviet Union, forged during his days as the leader of the Marxist
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), have allowed Russia to
easily rekindle a relationship with his friendly government. In El
Salvador, the governing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)
is the most recent reliable Russian partner in the region, based on the
former Sovient Union\'s support for the FMLN\'s guerilla army during El
Salvador\'s civil war.5 The Gerasimov Doctrine in Latin America The
strategic underpinning of the multi-faceted Russian activities in Latin
America is the 2013 \"Gerasimov Doctrine,\" put forward by General
Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, a
position that gives him operational control of Russian military
intelligence (GRU).6 Gerasimov posited that Russia is in a state of
permanent warfare, rather than facing a choice of war or peace. Within
the continuum of blurred lines between war and peace is a new form of
non-linear, or hybrid, warfare, in which all elements of the state are
continually engaged, with greater or lesser emphasis.7 A recent NATO
report unpacked this doctrine and the implications for Russia\'s new
approach to warfare, and in particular hybrid warfare, noting: Such a
war, they argue, goes way beyond the frames of the traditional
understanding of these wars. They include political intrigues, fights
over resources and financial flows, and irreconcilable civilizational
conflicts. On the battlefield in these wars, regular forces act
alongside a number of new actors-irregular forces of rebels and
fighters, criminal gangs, international terrorist networks, private
military companies, and legions of foreign mercenaries, units of
spetsnaz and intelligence formations from different countries, military
contingents of peacekeepers from international organizations, and even
non-governmental and humanitarian organizations and structures,
representatives from printed and electronic mass media, volunteers, and
activists from civil society.8 Viewed through the prism of this
doctrine, Russia\'s activities in Latin America come into clearer focus.
While the U.S. position remains preeminent-due to geographic proximity,
cultural ties, and trade ties-Russia has advanced further and faster as
a competitive adversary than is often understood. A review of Russia\'s
activities in the region shows that, despite limited resources, the
Gerasimov Doctrine is being implemented through a policy that
incorporates multiple elements of soft power, coupled with military
training and hardware, to directly displace U.S. influence. This
includes counternarcotics and disaster relief, as well as engagement in
regional Latin American forums created by the Bolivarian Alliance for
the express purpose of excluding the United States and Canada. Diverse
Forms of Engagement Russia\'s desire to establish a stronger foothold in
Latin America is evidenced by the constant highlevel government visits
with its Latin American allies. In addition to more recent visits by
senior officials-including to Ecuador and Suriname- an analysis of
visits by senior Russians to Latin American countries from 2015 to 2017,
(including a vist from president Putin in November 2016 to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru), demonstrates a
far greater level of engagement between high-level (the equivalent of an
assistant secretary or above) officials of Latin American and Russian
governments than that of the United States.9 As demonstrated in news
articles and official government statements, Latin American officials
from an estimated 20 countries visited Russia 44 times during those
three years.10 Additionally, high-ranking Russian officials visited six
Latin American countries on 11 occasions. This high-level presence
decreased after 2017, with president Putin only visiting Latin America
once in 2018, and even then only because the G20 summit was held in
Argentina.11 [Admittedly, U.S. engagement with the region extends far
beyond highlevel or state visits, so this record does not suggest that
Russian influence now exceeds that of the United States, but it does
provide a useful point of reference]{.underline}. Equally important,
experts widely agree that Russia\'s domestic political and economic
troubles will likely prevent it from fully displacing the preeminent
position that U.S. economic, security, and aid partnerships currently
hold in the region. [Nevertheless, these visits indicate that Russia is
actively seeking partners in Latin America and is finding many countries
in the region that are willing to consider such overtures. Although
still dwarfed by weapons sales from the United States and elsewhere,
Russia has made significant inroads in recent years throughout Latin
America, primarily with friendly countries, **to expand its arms sales
in the region**. A recent NATO report noted the significant military
purchases of Russian equipment by the Maduro regime, as well as
President Ortega in Nicaragua: Since 2005, Venezuela has purchased \$11
billion worth of equipment from Russia, including fighter jets,
helicopters and rifles. Moscow provided loans to Caracas to help
purchase the S-300VM anti-ballistic missile system to protect Venezuelan
waters in 2013. The recent acquisition made Venezuela the second biggest
importer of Russian arms between 2012 and 2015, after
India.]{.underline} Lately, Russia also sent warships to the Caribbean
to perform drug patrols. Colombians were outraged in October 2013, when
two Russian supersonic bombers, capable of carrying nuclear warheads,
flew from Venezuela to Nicaragua over San Andres, disputed territory
between Colombia and Nicaragua. In March 2015, Venezuelan President
Nicolás Maduro ordered the major military exercise \"Bolivarian
shield,\" with Russian participation, as a response to U.S. sanctions
against seven Venezuelan officials.12 [The Russian news agency TASS
recently reported that since 2000, the Russian arms exporter
Rosoboronexport has sold \$10 billion in weaponry and military equipment
to Latin American nations.1]{.underline}3 The company is working with
Argentina, Brazil, [Colombia, Mexico, and Peru to broker deals for both
ground and air equipment, in particular Ural trucks and motor vehicles.
In addition to Rosoboronexport, the Russian companies Rostec and Irkut
Aircraft Corporation are also known to be operating in the region,
including attending military expositions in Latin America.]{.underline}
Although producing few tangible results, Russia [has also publicly
expressed its willingness to partner on **nuclear projects** in Latin
America.]{.underline} In October 2016, Russia and Paraguay announced a
new Pacific nuclear energy partnership, which begins a new wave of
investments and technology sharing between the two countries.14
Similarly, in January 2018 Argentina announced a recent memorandum of
understanding with Russia\'s state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which
covered uranium exploration in Argentina as well as assistance in the
construction of nuclear power plants.15 Russia has also made a concerted
effort to deepen its partnerships with Bolivia, recently announcing that
it would assist Bolivia in building a \"nuclear center to research
radiation technologies applied in agriculture, medicine and various
industries.\"16 After announcing that he had met with a number of
Russian officials, and was considering additional partnerships in a
number of other areas- including lithium production-Bolivian President
Evo Morales, who recently visited Russia, commented warmly on the
growing Russian presence in the region.17

### Link - Southeast Asia (Russia)

#### Russia is trying to increase its arms to Southeast Asia

**Ogawa 19** \[Tomoyo Ogawa, 2-3-2019, \"Russia vies with US as it steps
up arms exports to Southeast Asia,\" Nikkei Asian Review,
<https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Russia-vies-with-US-as-it-steps-up-arms-exports-to-Southeast-Asia>
//mh\]

MOSCOW \-- [Russia is ramping up its weapons sales to Southeast and
South Asia,]{.underline} with Moscow overtaking Britain as the world\'s
second-largest exporter.

Th[e Kremlin\'s aggressive sales campaign has raised fears of an arms
rac]{.underline}e in Canberra and Washington, where the Trump
administration has unveiled its own \"buy American\" effort to sell more
U.S. weapons systems worldwide.

T[he Asia-Pacific is a theater of intensifying rivalry between the two
military superpowers, partly fueled by countries buying arms to counter
security threats from Chinese naval expansion i]{.underline}n the South
China Sea but also from international terrorist groups.

Russia \-- the largest arms exporter to the region \-- is supplying
missile defense systems, tanks and fighter jets to countries ranging
from India to Laos and Vietnam. Russia was the largest supplier of arms
for the region from 2013 to 2017, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute.

In January, Russia delivered four Yak-130 fighter jets to Laos based on
a contract signed in 2017. In addition, Laos is being supplied with
tanks, lightly armored vehicles and other types of weapons, the Russian
defense ministry said.

Russia was home to 10 of the world\'s 100 largest weapons manufacturers
in terms of sales in 2017, according to data released in December by
SIPRI. Moscow\'s combined sales amounted to \$37.7 billion, an 8.5% rise
from the previous year and representing 9.5% of overall global arms
sales, which totaled \$398.2 billion.

[Russia\'s weapons shipments surpassed Britain\'s \$35.7 billion, making
it the second-largest arms seller, after the U.S.]{.underline}

Russia sold \$19 billion worth of weapons in 2018, according to Sergey
Chemezov, CEO of Rostec, the government-owned industrial group that
includes Russia\'s monopoly arms exporter in its vast portfolio.

\"Today Russia confidently holds second place in the world by volume of
military and technical cooperation,\" Chemezov was quoted by Russia\'s
Tass news agency as saying. He said that in 2018 the country sold nearly
25% more in arms than the year before.

Russian military experts say [the country\'s weapons carry lower price
tags than those from their Western counterparts.]{.underline} It is
believed that Russia\'s military intervention in the civil war in Syria
was partly motivated by Moscow\'s desire to test and demonstrate the
performance of Russian arms.

Even after international economic sanctions were imposed on Russia in
response to its invasion of Ukraine in 2014, arms exports have remained
a steady revenue source for Moscow.

[Russia is prioritizing Asia in its arms export expansion drive. The
region absorbs over 60% of Russia\'s arms shipments, with most of them
going to Southeast Asia.]{.underline}

Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of Vietnam\'s Communist Party,
visited Russia in September and struck a \$1 billion arms deal with
Moscow.

President Vladimir Putin met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in
India in October and agreed to sell the sophisticated S-400
surface-to-air missile defense system to the South Asian country in a
deal worth \$5 billion.

[Washington is concerned that sales of Russian weapons systems, like the
S-400 to India and other countries in the region, could lead to U.S.
military secrets being leaked to the Kremlin.]{.underline}

The Countering America\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act was
introduced in 2017, aimed at punishing Russia for its alleged meddling
in the 2016 U.S. elections and its actions in Ukraine. It prohibits any
country from signing \"significant\" defense deals with Russia. In
September 2018, the U.S. imposed secondary sanctions on the Chinese
military for buying fighter jets and S-400 system-related equipment from
Russia.

The Trump administration\'s \"buy American\" policy aims to boost arms
exports worldwide. American arms sales to foreign governments rose 13%
to \$192 billion in fiscal 2018 ended Sept. 30, according to the State
Department.

Alexey Muraviev, associate professor of national security and strategic
studies at Curtin University in Australia, discussed regional tensions
in a commentary published in The Conversation, an independent source of
news and views sourced from academic and research communities.

\"[After years of decline and neglect, Russian military power in the
Asia-Pacific region is making a major leap forward]{.underline},\"
Muraviev wrote.

\"Russia is making its presence felt in the region for the benefit of
its regional allies and clients, and as a form of deterrent to its
geopolitical rivals,\" he said.

\"The time has come for us to appreciate a power north of the Great
Wall,\" Muraviev wrote.

[By early February, Russia]{.underline} had [sent nine planes with
weapons along with dozens of contractors to train local soldiers and
secure mining projects]{.underline}, marking the start of its
highest-profile military foray [in sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline} for
decades. [Muscling in on a country dominated by France for years served
as a **statement of intent about Moscow's renewed push for global
prestige and influence,** and is part of a wider campaign shaking up
long-standing power dynamics on the continent.]{.underline} Since
Western nations sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea in 2014, [Moscow
has signed 19 military cooperation deals in sub-Saharan Africa,
including with Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe,]{.underline} according to
its foreign and defense ministries and state media. [The
continent's]{.underline} 54 [member states]{.underline} at the United
Nations -- [three of which sit on the Security Council]{.underline} at
any given time -- [form the organization's largest voting
bloc]{.underline} and one of its most coherent, [making them attractive
allies for Russia]{.underline}. "[The West is not very much loved by
many countries. And many (see) Russia as the country that will oppose
the West]{.underline}," said Dmitri Bondarenko, an anthropologist and
historian at Russia's Institute for African Studies. Besides sending
arms and contractors to CAR, Russian national Valery Zakharov is a
security adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadera and Russia's
defense ministry said last week it planned to establish a five-person
team at CAR's defense ministry. [Russia's moves come at a time when the
defense ministry's influence over Kremlin foreign policy is growing
against a backdrop of heightened tension with the West.]{.underline}

SEIZED WEAPONS When CAR made its plea in 2017, there was recognition
that a spike in ethnic fighting could turn into a far larger conflict
and that its security forces were too weak to tackle myriad armed
groups. [CAR has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 so weapons
shipments must be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR sanctions
committee,]{.underline} made up of the Council's 15 members, [including
France and Russia]{.underline}. It operates by consensus. [France first
offered to help CAR buy old weapons but the proposal was too expensive.
France then offered 1,400 AK47 assault rifles it had seized off Somalia
in 2016]{.underline}, according to a Security Council memo and four
diplomats. [Russia objected on the grounds that weapons seized for
breaching the U.N. arms embargo on Somalia could not be recycled for use
in another country under embargo]{.underline}, two diplomats said. [But
mindful of the need for a quick solution, the sanctions committee
approved Moscow's donation of AK47s, sniper rifles, machineguns and
grenade launchers in December]{.underline}, according to committee
documents and diplomats. "We presented our problem and Russia offered to
help us, subject to Security Council approval," said Albert Yaloke
Mokpeme, CAR's presidential spokesman. "If peace is restored tomorrow in
CAR, I think everyone will be happy." Russia's foreign ministry did not
respond to requests for comment about committee proceedings. France's
foreign ministry said Russia must strictly respect the terms of its arms
embargo exemption to keep the weapons out of the wrong hands.

'WE'RE NOT INTERESTED' During the Cold War, the Soviet Union forged
close military and diplomatic ties with many African countries. It was
involved in proxy wars in states such as Angola, Ethiopia and Mozambique
and helped independence movements fight Western colonial powers. [Russia
is now trying to revive some of the relationships that lapsed after the
Soviet Union's collapse. It joins a number of countries such as Turkey
and the United Arab Emirates looking to set up bases in Africa, mediate
in diplomatic stand-offs and strike business deals. China has long had a
major economic presence]{.underline} in Africa but it has shied away
from any military involvement. It did go a step further last year,
however, [opening its first military base outside China in Djibouti.
Near the world's busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti is also home to a
large French base, the only U.S. base in Africa, an Italian camp and
Japan's only overseas base.]{.underline} Djibouti blocked Russian
attempts to set up a base, however, saying it wanted to avoid becoming
the terrain for a proxy war. [Moscow is now planning to build a
logistics center at a port in neighboring Eritrea.]{.underline} While
France has a military bases outside Djibouti in former colonies Gabon,
Ivory Coast and Senegal and its soldiers also operate in Chad, Mali and
Niger, **[analysts say Washington's influence is on the
wane]{.underline}**. Its trade with the continent has halved in the past
decade, though much of that is due to U.S. shale replacing oil imports
from Africa. Diplomatic posts have gone unfilled and a task force based
in CAR tracking warlord Joseph Kony left last year. "[Our actions on the
diplomatic and military side have sent a huge signal to our partners
that **we're not interested in Africa**," said Donald Bolduc, who
commanded U.S. special forces across the continent until last
year]{.underline}. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Tibor Nagy said Washington's commitment to Africa was unwavering but,
"there is space for other countries to play a positive role in the
region".

AFRICAN DEALS [As part of Russia's renewed push,]{.underline} Foreign
Minister [Sergei Lavrov went on a five-nation tour of Africa in
March]{.underline}, attended a summit in South Africa in June and
visited Rwanda, chair of the African Union, this year. [Russia has also
struck military cooperation deals with many African countries since
2015, **though some have yet to come into force**]{.underline}. [The
agreements typically involve **providing weapons** and training in areas
such as counter-terrorism and piracy]{.underline}. Analysts caution that
the deals often appear more symbolic than transformative and say it's
not clear if Russia has the resources, or desire, to continue expanding
its presence. But as in the Cold War, [military deals can come alongside
economic links, such as mining and energy agreements. Ethiopia signed
its deal in April, a month after Lavrov visited to discuss nuclear
energy, agriculture and transportation projects. Russian firms have
signed mineral deals in Sudan, which cooperates with Moscow in defense
technology, and Russia is looking at diamond and platinum projects in
Zimbabwe as well as energy projects in Chad. Over the past decade,
Russian trade with sub-Saharan Africa has increased fast, albeit from a
low base]{.underline}. From 2010-2017, total trade rose to \$4.2 billion
a year from \$1.6 billion, according to the Center for Strategic &
International Studies www.csis.org. During the same period, China's
total trade with sub-Saharan Africa nearly doubled to \$165 billion
while U.S. trade more than halved to \$37 billion.

WAGNER GROUP [Since arriving in CAR]{.underline}, the
[Russians]{.underline}' remit has [expanded beyond military
advice]{.underline} and [into various economic and diplomatic
activities]{.underline}, a Western diplomat and security source said,
fuelling the beginnings of a Western backlash. In August, France, the
United Kingdom and the United States blocked a Russian request to send
more weapons. The U.S. mission to the United Nations said in a note to
the sanctions committee that it was awaiting, "confirmation that
measures had been taken to ensure the secure management of the previous
donation". [Estimates of the number of Russians in CAR vary widely, from
250 to 1,000]{.underline}. Touadera's spokesman declined to provide
details, nor say what activities the Russians were engaged in. Yevgeny
[Shabayev, head of a chapter of a paramilitary Cossack organization who
has ties to Russian security contractors, said there could be 1,000 in
CAR and 5,000 to 10,000 across Africa, including in Sudan, South Sudan
and Libya]{.underline}. One Russian private military contractor, the
Wagner group, was thrust into the spotlight in July when three Russian
journalists were killed in CAR while investigating its alleged presence
there. Reuters has been unable to confirm whether Wagner contractors are
in CAR. People with ties to the group have told Reuters it has carried
out clandestine combat missions on the Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine and
Syria. Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their
orders. They have denied any role in the journalists' deaths. Russia has
also stepped into negotiations with militias in CAR, adding to Western
misgivings about its presence. According to a U.N. panel of experts,
Touadera's Russian adviser has met militia leaders several times to
discuss disarmament and the distribution of natural resources revenue.
Russia said in August after brokering talks between armed groups that
Touadera had expressed gratitude for its involvement and that it
intended to continue its mediation. Reuters was unable to contact the

guy and the rest of the presidential advisers," the security source
said. "When you ask, 'Can we see your colleague?' they say, 'Who, our
colleague? We don't know him'."

Like Latin America, [Africa is a market of modest importance to Russian
arms manufacturers.]{.underline} It accounted for 3 per cent of Russia's
total arms exports between 2000 and 2016, with sales by volume
concentrated in Sudan (0.9 per cent), Uganda (0.6 per cent) and Ethiopia
(0.5 per cent). While the volume of sales is not large from Russia's
perspective, Figure 11 shows that the country has been the dominant
supplier of weaponry in a number of countries: accounting for 44 per
cent of imported weapons in Eritrea (or 54 per cent if one includes the
two Su-27 aircraft that were imported from Ukraine in 2002--03), 50 per
cent in Ethiopia, 50 per cent in Sudan and 74 per cent in Uganda.
Russian manufacturers are also competitive in Angola (accounting for 28
per cent of arms exports to the country), Ghana (22 per cent) and
Nigeria (22 per cent). [While Russian arms are competitive across
sub-Saharan Africa, most of the region's countries are comparatively
poor. Defence spending in absolute terms is therefore too modest for
Africa to become a destination of real commercial significance.
Th]{.underline}is will not change unless economic growth accelerates at
a sustained rate across the region. [Nevertheless, Russian exporters
appear keen to strengthen their position, with officials from
Rosoboroneksport describing Africa as a 'growth market']{.underline}.[70
Russian suppliers appear to be prepared to tailor their approach to the
African market by focusing on the provision of either older equipment or
of service and repair facilities]{.underline}.71 Regardless of whether
the region grows in commercial importance, [Russia's importance as a
supplier of armaments there means that it could exploit any political
capital that might be gained from this position by seeking to acquire
basing rights for its armed forces,]{.underline} or by supporting its
energy and mining firms in gaining rights to exploit African natural
resources.72 However, Russia is not the only country to be making such
efforts on the continent. It [faces stiff competition from China, which
has been a growing source of arms and has provided increasing support to
African countries in the development of their natural
resources]{.underline}.

#### Ending US offers of the Patriot missile system to Turkey would cause greater investment in the S-400

HMEIMIM AIR BASE, Syria---[North from Syria]{.underline}, along the
borders of Eastern Europe and rounding the Arctic Circle to the east,
[Russia has built a ring of air defenses that threaten the reach of the
U.S. military,]{.underline} forcing Washington to rethink its place as
the world's undisputed air power. R[ussia's S-400 antiaircraft missile
system, a nettlesome and potentially deadly aerial shield, is changing
the calculus of the]{.underline} U.S. and its allies in potential hot
spots, [beginning with its deployment in Syria. Radar employed by the
S-400,]{.underline} which Russia claims can detect the latest stealth
aircraft, [casts a net around western Syria that stretches from Turkey
to the Mediterranean Sea to Israel.]{.underline} While it hasn't been
tested in battle, S-400 radar tracking has shooed away aircraft of the
U.S.-led coalition in Syria "as soon as they see on their electronic
indicators that they are being watched," Lt. Gen. Viktor Gumyonny,
commander of Russia's air-defense forces, told a TV interviewer.
Russia's hybrid warfare tactics against the West, including election
meddling and online disinformation campaigns, have drawn the most
attention from lawmakers and the U.S. government. Proliferation of the
S-400 system demonstrates how Russia is also investing heavily in
traditional military firepower. Airborne Defense \[Graph Omitted\] "We
have to understand that the period of U.S. absolute dominance of the air
is over," said Elbridge Colby, the director of the defense program at
the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan defense think
tank. The Pentagon acknowledged that [S-400 batteries in Syria have
forced adjustments to coalition air operations, but it contended the
U.S. in general still maintains freedom of movement in the
air]{.underline}. "We can continue to operate where we need to be," a
U.S. defense official said. The White House revamped its National
Security Strategy in late 2017 to account for the new challenge. Russia
is "fielding military capabilities designed to deny America access in
times of crisis and to contest our ability to operate freely," a report
said. "They are contesting our geopolitical advantages." A bipartisan
commission established by Congress to evaluate President Trump's defense
strategy echoed those fears in a paper released in November. Russia, the
commission concluded, was "seeking regional hegemony and the means to
project power globally." [The commission said Russia's actions were
"diminishing U.S. military advantages and threatening vital U.S.
interests."]{.underline} The Kremlin has long opposed what it calls a
U.S.-led world order. Through its increasingly aggressive foreign
policy, Russia seeks a foothold in a world that would be divided into
spheres of influence controlled by Moscow, Washington and Beijing.
M[oscow isn't eager to confront U.S. forces head-on]{.underline}: Russia
has a military budget about a 10th the size of the Pentagon's. [Despite
Russia's intervention in Syria and invasion of Crimea, its air force and
navy capabilities fall far short of the U.S. and China's
military]{.underline}. In Syria, more Russian army personnel have been
killed in plane crashes than enemy fire, according to official data.
Russia's sole aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, is being
overhauled. In October, a crane fell on the vessel, causing serious,
possibly irreparable damage to the carrier. [The S-400's guided missiles
are intended to give Russian President Vladimir Putin a lethal
threat]{.underline} against Western military intervention should a
crisis erupt on Russia's European borders, in the Middle East or North
Korea. [The presence of the S-400 in Syria has been an effective sales
tool, drawing]{.underline} interest among both American foes and allies.
Purchases by China and India, as well as prospective deals with Turkey
and Saudi Arabia, have raised alarms among officials in Washington and
at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. [As Russia fills orders, the
expanding S-400 footprint creates barriers that threaten decades of
unchallenged U.S. air superiority]{.underline} in the Middle East, the
Arctic and parts of Asia. By selling the S-400 to other countries,
Russia spreads the cost of limiting U.S. forces. "Russia doesn't want
military superiority, but it has ended the superiority of the West or
the U.S.," said Sergey Karaganov, a foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Putin.
"Now, the West can no longer use force indiscriminately." The Pentagon
said Russian measures have yet to change America's position. "The U.S.
remains the pre-eminent military power in the world and continues to
strengthen relationships with NATO allies and partners to maintain our
strategic advantage," said Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman. "The U.S.
and our allies have quite a few measures at our disposal to ensure the
balances of power remain in our favor." Russia's rise After the breakup
of the Soviet Union in 1991, the U.S. moved into the role of the world's
unchallenged superpower. Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
U.S. used its air superiority against foreign governments considered a
threat. Afghanistan, Iraq and then Libya fell into the crosshairs. In
2010, Mr. Putin announced a plan in to modernize Russia's military,
saying his nation would spend the equivalent of \$650 billion over a
decade. The plan included replacement and upgrades of aging Soviet
antiaircraft and antiship defenses. Russia's preoccupation with defense
is a product of its history, spanning past invasions by Napoleon
Bonaparte's army in the War of 1812 to Nazi troops during World War II.
"The Russian military is configured very differently from expeditionary
powers like the United States," said Michael Kofman, a research
scientist at CNA, a nonprofit research group in Arlington, Va. "It's not
meant to mirror powers like the United States, it's meant to counter
them." S-400 antiaircraft missiles in Sevastopol on the Crimean
peninsula. . PHOTO: MALGAVKO SERGEI/TASS/ZUMA PRESS Buyers of the S-400
face possible U.S. sanctions under a 2017 law that penalizes allies that
do business with the Russian defense industry. China received an S-400
shipment last year, and its Equipment Development Department, which
oversaw the purchase, was sanctioned in September. India agreed in
October to a \$5 billion-plus deal for the S-400 antiaircraft system. It
hopes to evade sanctions, saying that as a U.S. security partner it can
counterbalance China's growing power. It is unclear whether Saudi
Arabia's deal with Russia will be completed because of likely U.S.
pressure. The Pentagon has objected to Turkey's planned S-400 purchase,
saying it would give Russia too close a view of NATO operations.
Antiaircraft missile systems typically receive data from satellites as
well as aircraft to detect attacks. Integration of the S-400 system on
Turkish bases also would give Russia insight into radar-evading F-35
combat jets, U.S. officials said. Missile Matchup The S-400 hasn't been
tested in battle but on paper it outperforms the comparable U.S.-made
Patriot system. Sales to China and India, along with prospective deals
with Turkey and Saudi Arabia, have raised alarms in the West. \[Graph
Omitted\] The S-400 deal could jeopardize the delivery of F-35 fighters
bound for Turkey, U.S. officials have said. Turkish officials said they
need the antiaircraft system to shield the southern border with Syria.
Washington installed U.S.-operated Patriot missiles in southern Turkey
in 2013, after Syrian armed forces shot down a Turkish jet fighter
killing two. The systems were removed in 2015 when the U.S. saw the
threat from Syria fading. [The U.S. has since offered to sell Turkey its
Patriot missile defense systems, and an American delegation was in
Ankara last week to hash out the details]{.underline}. Still, Turkey
said, it had no intentions of giving up the S-400 purchase. Missile to
missile On paper, the S-400 outperforms the Patriot missile system. Its
radar system can track as many as 300 potential targets---missiles or
aircraft---as far as 250 miles and at speeds close to 3 miles a second.
The Patriot can lock on to 100 potential targets and hit a target moving
a maximum speed of just under a mile per second. The basic S-400 unit
has four launchers carried on a wheeled transport vehicle. It takes
about eight minutes to push the 33-foot launching tubes into a vertical
position, initiate tracking radar and lock onto targets. The bulk of
Russia's S-400s are deployed along the country's western border; S-400
divisions also defend the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Moscow
seized from Ukraine in 2014. Several divisions are positioned on four of
Russia's Arctic territories. As polar ice gives way to global warming,
both Washington and Moscow see the far north as a new frontier for
Arctic sea travel, potentially connecting Asia and Europe, as well as a
spot for energy exploration. Farther east, the S-400 is positioned to
cover the northern end of the Kuril Islands, territory the Soviet Union
seized at the end of World War II. Japan claims four of the islands at
the southern end of the archipelago. Russia has more than 300 of the air
defense systems across the country, according to its defense ministry.
The exact number and locations are secret. Washington accuses Moscow of
violating the Cold War-era Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,
saying the Russian 9M729 missile could fly at a range prohibited by the
agreement. Russia says the missile doesn't violate the agreement. Russia
has deployed other defenses to discourage enemy forces from penetrating
its sea and land borders. Antiship missiles reinforce Kuril Island
defenses, and there are short-range ballistic Iskander missiles in the
Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, between Lithuania and Poland. Despite
its economic downturn in the past several years, triggered by lower oil
prices and Western sanctions, the Kremlin in November earmarked another
19 trillion rubles, more than \$300 billion, over the next decade to
spend on weapons research, development and production. Looking ahead,
Almaz-Antey, the Russian arms maker that builds the antiaircraft defense
systems, is designing a more advanced S-500 model to counter
next-generation hypersonic and intercontinental ballistic missiles. The
company has chosen two plants for large-scale manufacturing of the
S-500, which is scheduled to start production in 2020.

[Over the past decade, Vietnam has risen in importance]{.underline} as a
market [for Russian weapons]{.underline}: between 2010 and 2016 it
imported 10 per cent of all Russia's arms exports. Indeed Vietnam
imports almost all its defence equipment from Russia, including aircraft
and naval vessels such as the Su-30MK fighter, Tarantul-class corvettes,
Gepard-class corvettes and the Varshavyanka-class diesel-electric
submarine.55 Like India, [Vietnam has a well-established relationship
with Russia.]{.underline} The Vietnamese military was not only given
equipment by the Soviet Union, it was also dependent upon Soviet
funding.56 When the Soviet Union collapsed, a large proportion of the
funding and maintenance of the Vietnamese defence structure disappeared.
Since then, the Vietnamese economy has grown briskly.57 Moreover, total
government expenditure as a share of GDP has grown steadily since 1998,
reaching almost 30 per cent in 2015.58 [The expansion of budgetary
resources has enabled the government to address problems including
obsolete military hardware]{.underline} -- something that is especially
important for it given rising tensions with China in the South China
Sea. [Because of the nature of the military threats perceived by
Vietnam, defence procurement has been tilted towards the navy and the
air force. The biggest threat to Russia's position in the Vietnamese
market is connected to Vietnam's increasingly warm relations with the
US. Due to a shared interest in checking any Chinese expansionism in
Southeast Asia, relations between Vietnam and the US have improved
significantly in recent years, resulting in the softening of US
sanctions that proscribe the sale of armaments]{.underline} to Vietnam.
[Were relations to warm further, it is possible that Vietnam might be
able to purchase US weapon systems, which would expose Russian firms to
greater competition.]{.underline}59

SINGAPORE --- The U.S. State Department wants to see Vietnam distance
itself from Russian arms deals and buy more weapons from the United
States, but experts say the cost and complication of American-made
technologies could make that transition hard fought. Between 2005 and
2014, Vietnam increased its military spending by almost 400 percent,
according to the U.S. Department of Commerce-run website export.gov.
However, the country hasn't considerably stepped up purchases of
American-made weapons, even after the United States lifted its lethal
weapons ban on Vietnam in 2016, a State Department official told
reporters. "The Vietnamese are very interested in a greater security
partnership," the official said ahead of the Singapore Airshow, which
runs from Feb. 6 to 11. "We are also encouraging them to look beyond the
U.S. grant assistance to also diversifying away from some of their
typical suppliers --- their historical suppliers like the Russians ---
into buying U.S. equipment that would, one, give them more capability
and, two, help strengthen our partnership for the interoperability and
the greater interaction with our military." Over the past month, several
senior U.S. national security officials have visited Vietnam to help
reinforce diplomatic and military ties between the two countries. In his
January visit, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced that the United
States would send an aircraft carrier to the country for a port visit
--- the first such event since the Vietnam War. Before attending the air
show to meet with U.S. industry and international partners, Ambassador
Tina Kaidanow, the State Department's principal deputy assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs, also made a stop in
Vietnam for the U.S.-Vietnam Political, Security, and Defense Dialogue.
[During a phone call with reporters Monday, Kaidanow said the U.S.
relationship with Vietnam is improving, and she spoke about the
administration's desire to see more defense contracts between the two
nations.]{.underline} "As they move forward, it's completely up to them
as a sovereign country, how they go about acquiring their defense
systems," she said. "Certainly our hope is that they will consider
American companies not just, by the way, in the defense sector but in
other sectors as well where our trade issues are important for them to
consider." [Vietnam is interested in U.S. military technology, as
evidenced by the transfer of a Hamilton-class cutter from the U.S. Coast
Guard in 2016 and a recent sale --- partially through U.S. grant funding
--- of Boeing-Insitu ScanEagle drones for maritime
surveillance]{.underline}, the State Department official said. However,
the country is unfamiliar with the Foreign Military Sales and Direct
Commercial Sales programs, two different ways to acquire weapons from
either the State or Commerce departments. "They're still learning our
system, and we're doing our very best to make sure that they understand
what the U.S. system provides and how it works," he said. "The U.S.
system can be a little daunting sometimes, and so getting them familiar
with what the options are, what path you can pursue, you know, what you
can get from FMS versus what you can get through DCS." [Vietnam has a
long history of buying Russian-made arms, which are seen by the
Vietnamese military as less expensive and complex than U.S. weapons.
Even so, the country appears to be weaning itself away from buying
Russian equipment,]{.underline} said Collin Koh Swee Lean, a research
fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies who
specializes in naval affairs in Southeast Asia. "Hanoi has become
increasingly fed up with Russia's arms sales policy, a lot to do with
Russia 'shifting the goal posts' where it comes to contractual terms and
pricing issues, and significantly Vietnam's access to technology
transfer from Russia," he said. Another issue is Russia's military sales
to China. "Not only is there a possibility that Moscow could cave in to
Beijing's demand to stop supplies to Vietnam in times of a
Sino-Vietnamese conflict, but that the PLA \[People's Liberation Army of
China\] could possibly be already familiar with and thus able to devise
a counter against VPA's \[People's Army of Vietnam's\] Russian
equipment," he explained. Euan Graham, the director of Lowy Institute's
international security program, said [momentum seems to be growing for
Vietnam to become a larger customer of U.S. weaponry.]{.underline}
"\[Vietnam\] is a large arms importer relative to its size. Perhaps at
the high end, F-16s are still possible," he said. "That would be a big
leap forward, although cheaper non-Russian alternatives like Gripen are
still in the frame." However, some U.S. technology, even older or used
platforms like P-3 maritime surveillance aircraft, will probably remain
too complicated and expensive for the Vietnamese military for some time,
he said. And as Vietnam distances itself from Russia, it appears to be
gravitating more toward Israel rather than the United States, Lean
argued. Part of that is due to the perception of Israeli products as a
better value for the Vietnamese military, but other concerns are more
political. "There's still an element of distrust between Vietnam and the
U.S," he said. Attempts to deepen the countries' relationship in defense
or security matters could incite a backlash from those who oppose U.S.
actions during the Vietnam War. Furthermore, relying on the United
States for weapons could be a risky proposition for Vietnam, as
different political administrations have different standards for when to
cut off a partner nation's access to U.S. weapons due to human rights
concerns or various other issues, Lean said. At the Singapore Airshow,
Vietnam's delegation has kept a low profile, with no military aircraft
on display or flashy demonstration teams performing aerobatic maneuvers.
Still, officials are --- at the very least --- window-shopping at U.S.
defense contractors' chalets. "Just today, we've had Vietnamese
delegations come through the chalet. In the past, the Vietnamese
government has expressed interest, for example, in looking at P-3s,"
Orlando Carvalho, Lockheed Martin's head of aeronautics, said Tuesday.
"My sense is that the interest that Vietnam has right now I'd say is
kind of more exploratory. But if the Vietnamese government in fact
decided they want to go forward with something that's in our portfolio
at a more serious level, we're happy to discuss that with them."

**unable** to gather the **volume of information** it

**reduce this intelligence deficit**.]{.underline} Without the Five
Eyes, America could only "collect \[information\] ... against a part of

information** so the US government can prepare **more effectively** for
the threats it faces directly, and [the threats its **allies face** that
could **spill over to the U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline} (Cilluffo and Cardash, 2013).
[Cooperation]{.underline} between Canada and the United States [in the
**cyberrealm**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} largely [**embedded**
in]{.underline}, and a by-product of, [the **Five Eyes
regime**]{.underline}. As with much of the Canada-US partnership on
security-related matters, Canada-US cooperation for cybersecurity goes
even further than the Five Eyes. Close cooperation occurs between the
NSA and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE)2 to target
"approximately 20 high-priority countries" in the collection of signals
intelligence (SIGINT) (US, National Security Agency, Central Security
Service, 2013).

A capabilities gap exists between the United States---the primary,
technologically advanced, well-resourced partner---dand the secondary
Five Eyes partners (Lefebvre, 2003). Since Canada has a more limited
ability to develop sophisticated technology, Canada acquires and uses
NSA capabilities (US, National Security Agency, Central Security
Service, 2013) to help manage its portion of the partnership's mission.
Inevitably, [the United States **influences**]{.underline} some of [the
intelligence gathering done by Canada.]{.underline}

US-Canada [**[resource-sharing]{.mark}** in the
cybersphere]{.underline}---including hardware, software, and
personnel---[means that the NSA and CSE are relatively well
integrated]{.underline} (US, National Security Agency, Central Security
Service, 2013; Rudner, 2001). [While integration increases efficiency,
it also [**increases the prospect** of a **cyberattack** against **one
partner spreading to another**]{.mark}. Titan Rain, for example, was a
series of coordinated cyberattacks from 2003 to 2005 that originated
from China]{.underline} (Markoff, Sanger, and Shanker, 2010). [Although
Titan Rain initially stole information from the systems of the US
Department of Defense, it later spread to other "sensitive government
and private-sector systems"]{.underline} (Porteous, 2011: 1). By 2005,
[[**Titan Rain**]{.mark} had [infiltrated]{.mark} the systems of the
Five Eyes governments, amongst other **[American
allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Porteous, 2011; Thornburgh et al., 2005).
Likewise, [[an attack against a]{.mark} Five Eyes [ally could **spread
into the U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates** [via the allies'
**integrated** ]{.mark}**cyberintelligence
[assets.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[An **adversary in cyberspace** may only need to penetrate **one Five
Eyes system** to]{.mark} **find and [retrieve]{.mark}** [American
secrets through the **linked networks**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cox,
2012). **[[Interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while efficient,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps more of [[a **double-edged sword**
]{.mark}**in cybersecurity**]{.underline} than in conventional military
defence. Canadians should not underestimate the benefits they gain from
America's willingness to share advanced capabilities. The NSA's US\$10.8
billion budget (Gellman and Miller, 2013) easily dwarfs CSE's 2013
budget of CA\$460 million and 2014 budget of CA\$829 million (Freeze,
2013; Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, 2014). To upgrade CSE's
capabilities to roughly equivalent NSA levels would require a very large
increase in its budget, a costly and most unlikely investment. Instead,
Canada has "access to a \$15 billion global \[information-sharing\]
partnership" that imparts vital intelligence on key "threats and ...
technological challenges" through the Five Eyes (Canada, SSCNSD, 2012b).
Participating in the alliance provides Canada with access to a
multi-billion dollar intelligence apparatus without needing to make
equivalent investments in its own SIGINT capabilities. Cooperation is
decidedly cheaper than independently developing competitive intelligence
capabilities (Sims, 2006).

blow up every single nuclear weapon in Russia, or would you try to shut
down the command-and-control system so the orders never got there?" Is
the US ready? The Pentagon's second question is whether the US's plans
take into account those connections between cyber and nuclear warfare.
The US already incorporated cyber operations into its Nuclear Posture

### Impact -- Alliances

[**The National Security Strategy of 2017 and the National Defense
Strategy of 2018 both warn of the return of great power conflict** and
identify Russia and China as posing the greatest threats to U.S.
national security.]{.underline} [They acknowledge the containment of the
nascent nuclear power of Iran and North Korea, as well as the residual
threat from international terrorism and transnational crime as
additional ambient threats. To those, some add to the equation the
threats of climate change and pandemic outbreaks.]{.underline}

The problem with **[transactional foreign policy]{.underline}** is it
**[does not add up]{.underline}**. [The aggregate of individual
bilateral deals in foreign policy, whether good or bad deals, does not
equal a strategy, and inevitably fails to appreciate the forest for the
trees]{.underline}. **[With a foreign policy based on individual
bilateral deals, the United States might well end up with many deals yet
less security.]{.underline}**

Consider the primary challenges to U.S. national security noted above;
which of these can be successfully met by America alone? [**Russia and
China are** continental states with **increasing global reach. The
United States will need allies** around the world **to counter their
challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, in the Baltics and Eastern
Europe, and even in Africa and Latin America. To** effectively **stem
North Korean and Iranian nuclear aspirations will require allied
collaboration. Terrorism, crime, climate change, and pandemic diseases
respect no borders and can only be countered by extensive multilateral
collaboration.** What]{.underline} [**the United States needs** today is
not better deals, but **better relationships.**]{.underline}

[Strong international relationships, alliances, and partnerships are
built on mutual respect, predictability, and trust and must be
cultivated. "Trust cannot be surged." Certainly not by threats and
bullying]{.underline}. **[The global alliance structure for national and
international security forged by the United States has taken 75 years to
build. It is a unique asset that is the envy of every adversary; it is
indeed the fourth strategic offset to the growing technical, economic,
and military power of our adversaries.]{.underline}**

national interests could** eventually **become a framework for American

ensured containment of our Soviet adversary could ironically become the
architecture of our own encirclement as the ties that bind our allies to

#### The American alliance system reduces the possibility of war, maintains the liberal order, and provides leverage to resolve conflict

Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government; Alliances Are

//Brower\]

Recently, following a meeting with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO) G7, United States President Donald [Trump used
Twitter to express his frustrations with the European alliance
network]{.underline}. **[The president noted that the United States pays
"close to the entire cost of NATO--- protecting many of these same
countries that rip us off on trade."]{.underline}** He also said that
"Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH
larger GDP." In these tweets, Trump echoes two large myths about
America's alliance system. These myths are that NATO allies free ride
off the United States and that American allies provide little-to-no
security benefit.

**[The idea that European allies free ride off U.S. security spending is
long-standing]{.underline}**. George Kennan posited that a united Europe
would effectively balance against the Soviet Union, but politicians are
less trusting. Dwight Eisenhower frequently lamented that European
allies were not spending enough for their defense. Furthermore,
historical documents show that, when England cut its defense spending in
the mid-1960s, the Johnson administration was noticeably frustrated.
Moreover, according to Pew Research Center's surveys conducted [since
the end of the Cold War, most Americans support NATO, but a large
proportion believes Washington's policymakers spend too much money
helping the organization]{.underline}. In other words, **[Americans
think that NATO allies are paying their "fair share" on defense, and
thereby take advantage of U.S. security spending]{.underline}**.
Consequently, there is broad acceptance regarding the myth of a free
riding NATO.

The problem is that this myth ignores Kennan's still-standing Cold War
logic. **[For Kennan, the central idea of NATO was to de-securitize
Western European states and, paradoxically, strengthen European
security. This meant that by reducing the Europeans' state-led processes
of increasing power, European states would focus on "collective
security" instead of just their own.]{.underline}** Such a plan was
compelling because, after World War II, European states faced a threat
from communism and the Soviet Union. Accordingly, [they were willing to
avoid things like building nuclear weapons so that they could join
Washington's "security umbrella.]{.underline}" Furthermore, this
increased European collective security. Additionally, for the United
States, this reduced the likelihood of war between its European allies
and provided a way to balance against the Soviet Union.

In the present, **[while there is no Soviet threat, avoiding a European
security dilemma is advantageous for Washington.]{.underline}** G. John
Ikenberry's book After Victory examines the history of "world order."
[**He finds that liberal, rules-based orders**---like that established
by the United States after World War II---**last longer and are
significantly more peaceful than both hegemonic rule and "balance of
power" systems**]{.underline}. Two of the most critical contemporary
threats to the rules-based order is Russia's and China's rising power
and their expanding interests throughout Europe. NATO serves to
counteract those threats, and in doing so, maintains the international
system's stability. Therefore, [**retrenching from Europe is a**nother
**grave threat facing the U.S.-led international order, and one Trump
should take seriously.**]{.underline}

The second myth that [Trump's statements feed]{.underline} is [that
United States' alliances provide minimal benefits. Individuals who agree
with this argue that Washington's commitments to its friends both limit
America's ability to establish its supremacy and entrap it into conflict
because of contractual obligations.]{.underline} Consequently, by
retrenching from formal defense pacts, the United States could elongate
its unipolar status.

Inverting this logic, however, shows the reality of the situation.
First, **[allies limiting American primacy is a net benefit. Frankly,
reducing the amount of war and conflict is inherently advantageous, and
can preserve U.S. economic and military strength]{.underline}**. In his
2015 article, "The Myth of Entangling Alliances," Michael Beckley argues
that U.S. defense pacts reduce the risks of conflict. This is because,
[by having many allies across the world, America faces conflicting
commitments and needs to restrain itself militarily so that it can
satisfy these varying agreements.]{.underline} **[The offsetting
obligations allow Washington to avoid unnecessary
conflict.]{.underline}** Thus, similar to investment portfolios,
**[America's significant number of alliances reduce the risk of future
war.]{.underline}**

Furthermore, [because of **Washington**'s dominant position in its
alliance hierarchies, it **can effectively restrain its allies from
great conflicts**]{.underline}. [Smaller countries that do not want to
increase their security risk will not engage in wars that their stronger
allies wish to avoid. These small countries see a security benefit from
great power alliances, and the former is subservient to the
latter]{.underline}. For example, in Asia after World War II,
**[Washington restrained South Korea from attacking North Korea and
Taiwan from fighting China via threats to reduce American military and
economic support. Moreover, the United States threatened to end its arms
sales to Iran, thus forcing Tehran to avoid joining the 1973 oil
embargo. Accordingly, America's alliances provide it leverage that
increases its immediate security and decrease global
conflict.]{.underline}**

Overall, Trump and other critics fundamentally misunderstand the benefit
to the U.S. alliance network. **[NATO and other allies serve to maintain
the current rules-based international order, reduce Washington's risk of
war, and decrease levels of global conflict]{.underline}**. Therefore,
abandoning U.S. allies under the guise of **["America first"
would]{.underline}** harm American security, and just **[mean "America
alone."]{.underline}**

### I/L -- Navarro 

#### Arm sales are necessary for economic and national security -- they allow our defense base to achieve economies of scale and dominance 

**Navarro 2019** - director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing
Policy\
Peter, \"Why America Needs a Stronger Defense Industry,\" Mar 19,
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/trump-defense-industry.html

Enter President Trump, with a far different view of the role of a strong
military in both defending our homeland and revitalizing our
manufacturing base. As part of his significantly increased defense
budgets for 2019 and 2020, the president has requested an additional
\$11 billion to buy combat vehicles like the Abrams, as well as the
Stryker combat vehicle, also manufactured in Lima.

Even better, spending that \$11 billion could actually mean saving money
in the long run. By expanding production in Lima, [[by accelerating the
modernization of the Abrams]{.mark} and other armored vehicles [and by
increasing other economies of scale, the Defense Department will achieve
significant cost reductions:]{.mark}]{.underline} Unit costs for the
Abrams are expected to drop by more than 10 percent.

In terms of economic security, the Trump defense budget is helping to
create good manufacturing jobs at good wages, including in communities
like Lima that have fallen behind economically. The revitalized Lima
plant will directly employ a little more than 1,000 employees. [And
plants like the one in Lima are drivers for thousands of more jobs in
the supply chain across the country]{.underline}.

Consider, for example, the ripple effects of the Lima plant. In Ohio
alone, 198 of its suppliers are spread out across the state's 16
congressional districts. These mostly small and medium-size businesses
churn out components ranging from bearings, castings and industrial
packaging to electronic assemblies, pressure gauges and steel.

The impact is not limited to Ohio. Honeywell manufactures the Abrams
engine in Alabama, Allison manufactures its transmissions in Indiana,
the tank's main gun is made at the Watervliet Arsenal in New York,
special armor comes from the Idaho National Laboratory, and the gun tube
preforms come from Ellwood in Pennsylvania.

[In terms of national securit[y, state of the art tanks like the latest
versions of the Abrams are critical tools in increasing the
effectiveness of American ground forces, enabling the decisive defeat of
the threats]{.mark}]{.underline} outlined in our National Security
Strategy and National Defense Strategy.

A less obvious, but no less important, benefit comes from sharing these
upgraded combat vehicle capacities with our allies and strategic
partners through conventional arms sales.

In the Middle East, Kuwait's tank fleet consists of 218 Abrams tanks,
and its military is planning to double that number. Saudi Arabia has 374
recently upgraded Abrams tanks, while Egypt has the largest fleet, at
1,130. Australia commands a fleet of 59 Abrams tanks and may order 100
more. Taiwan may soon buy 108 Abrams tanks as well.

Those [[arms sales]{.mark} not only help [create good jobs]{.mark} at
good wages in America]{.underline} --- a principle not well understood
by the Obama administration --- [[they also enhance America's capacity
to bolster and stabilize our regional alliances, even as they may reduce
the need to deploy more American soldiers overseas]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### I/L - Alliances

#### Arms sales offset the risk of entrapment while signaling support for allies in the face of powerful adversaries

//Brower\]

After Jan. 20, President Donald [Trump will juggle a number of important
tensions with longstanding U.S. allies]{.underline}. For example,
[Trump's tweets suggest rapprochement with Russia is a priority, yet
NATO allies and the U.S. Congress will press for support to NATO allies,
such as those in the Baltic region]{.underline}. In Asia, Trump has
promised to take a strong line against Chinese assertiveness, but has
also questioned whether Japan and South Korea are contributing enough to
contain China. So **[Trump faces this dilemma: how can he reassure
allies while engaging adversaries? Our research suggests one
possibility: arms transfers.]{.underline}** In our recent International
Security article, we elaborate on [the "patron's dilemma]{.underline}"
that [arises when relationships with allies change. **We explain the
decades-old U.S. playbook, which calls for the United States to signal
reassurance and deterrence via arms transfers, while improving ties with
adversaries**.]{.underline} Will Trump follow this playbook? [**Arms
transfers are particularly useful when geostrategic priorities are
shifting.** Here's why we think Trump will use this foreign policy tool:
**Arms transfers accomplish two important goals: upgrading local
deterrent capabilities and offsetting fears of abandonment. Allies are
better equipped to defend themselves, thanks to U.S. weapons. Arms
transfers typically don't attract as much attention as U.S. military
deployments or new treaty commitments. But they can enable the recipient
to engage in aggressive foreign policies that the United States might
not desire, especially if the arms transfers enable offensive
operations. Experts call this worry "entrapment" --- when an ally gets
drawn into another country's conflict. Arms transfers signal a different
form of commitment than alliances**]{.underline}. After all, treaty
alliances tie hands by requiring allies to fight for one another in any
future conflict. Such treaties are formalized security ties --- and
usually follow a politicized ratification process. These "pieces of
paper" are inflexible, but do not necessarily require follow-up military
investment.

#### Pragmatic arms sales consolidate interests around deterring common adversaries -- multiple examples **Yarhi-Milo 17** \[Keren Yarhi-Milo - assistant professor of politics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University; Alexander Lanoszka - lecturer in the Department of International Politics at City, University of London; Zack Cooper - fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies; How can Donald Trump reassure nervous U.S. allies?

What sorts of arms transfers are most likely? Two factors shape what
combination of alliances and arms the United States might offer its
clients. [First, U.S. foreign policymakers look at shared security
interests when deciding whether to form or maintain an alliance. To make
this determination, U.S. policymakers typically ask whether the client
state has a similar or different ranking of security threats than that
of the United States.]{.underline} Here's an example. Both Western
Europe and the United States shared the view that the Soviet Union was
the leading threat to their vital interests after World War II, so they
formed NATO. [If the threat rankings align, Washington seeks to
establish or strengthen an alliance. If the threat rankings differ, then
U.S. foreign policymakers find that avoiding or downgrading an alliance
commitment better serves U.S. interests]{.underline}. Indeed, that is
why the Carter administration scrapped the U.S. formal alliance with
Taiwan to normalize ties with China in 1978. [Second, U.S. leaders
decide whether to arm the client. In making this decision, policymakers
ask whether the client can deter its adversary without U.S. assistance.
If the local security balance favors an adversary, then transfers of
U.S. weapons may be necessary to bolster the client's security. **If the
local security balance favors the ally**, **substantial arms transfers
are unnecessary --- and can even encourage entrapment by the
client**.]{.underline} Here's what this will mean in practice --- more
arms transfers So how might the next administration approach the
geopolitical conundrums associated with adjusting U.S. alliances? If
U.S. leaders seek rapprochement with Russia, is there a quid pro quo? A
close aide of Vladimir Putin has already suggested that pulling back
NATO forces from the Baltic region would reassure Moscow that Washington
seeks closer ties. Yet if Trump obliges, then he might be under pressure
from Congress and from NATO allies to reassure Baltic countries that the
United States will minimize the risks of Russia exploiting any great
power bargain. [To solidify the U.S. long-term commitment, Washington
might offer lethal defensive weapons to boost Baltic ground and air
defenses. This move would then enhance local deterrence.]{.underline}
Russia might have no other choice than to accept this compromise if its
desire for rapprochement is sincere. For a precedent, look no further
than the recent Iran deal. **[Since the July 2015 Iran nuclear deal,
Saudi Arabia has received large amounts of U.S. weapons, including an
arms agreement worth \$1 billion, to attenuate its security
concerns.]{.underline}** This scenario played out often after the
normalization of relations with China. Washington agreed to recognize
Beijing as the official government of China. Yet [Washington often made
major arms transfers like fighter jets and surface-to-air missile
systems to Taiwan to reassure Taipei that the United States remained
committed to Taiwan's ability to defend itself against mainland
China.]{.underline} Following Obama's footsteps? Unlike his stance on
Russia, Trump appears to favor a more hawkish approach toward China, as
evidence by his comments on the one-China policy. Yet Trump's comments
about burden-sharing by Japan and South Korea create a tension because
[balancing against China would require strengthening --- not weakening
--- alliances with Japan and South Korea. History suggests that more
arms sales to Taiwan are possible because the cross-strait military
balance is worsening due to China's military modernization. **The Trump
administration might feel it necessary to make larger, more advanced,
and more sustained arms packages than those committed to by President
Obama in 2015.** Moreover, despite calls for greater alliance
burden-sharing by Japan and South Korea, the new Trump administration
might invest more in those alliances to maintain local military balances
against China and North Korea, respectively.]{.underline} In short, [the
Trump administration might end up relying on arms transfers as its chief
tool of reassurance and deterrence from Europe to Asia. In doing so,
Trump would follow in the footsteps of the Obama administration, which
authorized more arms sales than any U.S. administration since World War
II. **For alliance politics, arms transfers might be the new art of the
deal.**]{.underline}

accessed 6/24/2019, EHS-AGS//\]

Measurement Issue

[Several obstacles hamper a complete understanding of Russia's arms
trade. Rosoboronexport]{.underline}, Russia's arms export agency, [does
not publicize total annual sales figures]{.underline}. In addition,
[some companies can sell arms directly to clients, bypassing
Rosoboronexport]{.underline}, and [may not disclose
information]{.underline}. When Moscow does disclose Russia's arms sales
figures, the details are generally sparse. [Unlike Western countries,
Moscow does not provide disaggregated data.]{.underline} The recipient
countries in the Middle East are also not consistently forthcoming with
details about receiving Russian weaponry.\[xi\]

Theoretically, as Chatham House points out, two measures are available
to understand arms trade: military capabilities transfer, which involves
estimating the material volume of arms transfer, and the financial value
of arms transfers. \[xii\] Both present challenges. For example, some
countries pay more than others do for the same weaponry. Also, countries
and sources use different definitions of what constitutes an arms
transfer, often with substantial variation. These issues hamper a
complete understanding of Russia's arms sales, and some, such as the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), have come up
with their own measures to overcome these difficulties.\[xiii\] Yet, the
available data, though incomplete, is sufficient to gain at least an
outline, and occasionally a more complete picture of Russian arms
exports.

Why Choose a Russian Weapon?

When countries prefer Russian weaponry over American systems, it is
usually for evident reasons. The US will not sell weapons to many of
Russia's clients for a variety of reasons. Russian weaponry is
relatively inexpensive and, generally speaking, often more robust than
comparable American systems. In some areas, Moscow's systems lag
severely behind the US in terms of quality and capabilities, but in
others, it is a near-peer competitor. For instance, Moscow is quite good
at building anti-aircraft missiles, such as the S-300 and S-400 systems,
based on lessons-learned from the Kosovo Air War. The American F-35
joint strike fighter can likely currently beat an S-400 (although there
is no way to know for sure unless they engage in direct combat).
However, Moscow is developing the next generation, the S-500, whose full
capabilities are unknown. Russian current-generation aircraft and
ballistic missile defenses are on par with those of the US in terms of
defense technology. Some Russian missiles have as long a range as
American missiles, a few of them even longer. \[xiv\] In addition, the
US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system is very slow, bureaucratic and
cumbersome, while Moscow takes less time to deliver after a contract is
signed.

[Moscow is weak when it comes to follow-up support of
sales]{.underline}, and Russian weaponry is not always as technically
advanced as America's, but it is good enough for the needs of many
markets, and is often far better than what the purchasing countries can
build themselves. Russian weaponry is also a good choice for states on a
budget. Moscow advertises this fact. For example, in early October 2015,
days after Russia's Syria intervention, [Moscow fired 26 cruise missiles
from primarily small corvettes in the Caspian Sea to hit targets in
Syria]{.underline}.\[xv\] [Moscow made a public display]{.underline} of
the event, not only to demonstrate Russia's own might but also to [show
other countries they need not purchase a large expensive warship to
achieve strong naval capabilities, and that Moscow would be happy to
help them]{.underline} achieve this goal.

Another practical consideration is that many [local military personnel
in the MENA region have trained on Russian weaponry and feel comfortable
operating it.]{.underline} As one American source familiar with the
situation explained it, "If you have an AK-47, why change to an
M-16?"\[xvi\] For example, helicopters are especially crucial to Egypt's
anti-Islamist campaign; and according to first-hand pilot accounts,
Russia' less expensive helicopters fit Egypt's needs well. Overall,
Russian attack helicopters are not necessarily superior technologically,
but they bring heavy firepower to a fight. They may fare worse in a
contested air space, but the Sinai airspace is not contested. The
Russian MiG-29 is a highly advanced aircraft, easier to maintain than an
American one, and cheaper than an F-22\[xvii\] (which the US is
currently not even exporting).

Beyond these advantages, [Russian weaponry comes with few strings
attached]{.underline}, in contrast to arms sales from Washington.
[Moscow, unlike the US, does not prohibit secondary arms
sales.]{.underline} This means, for example, that when the US sells
weapons to Egypt, the weapon must stay in Egypt.\[xviii\] But in Egypt's
context, [buying a Russian weapon it can easily resell to someone else
for profit]{.underline} may be a preferable option.

Moscow also does not burden arms sales with preconditions, such as
mandated improvements of human rights. In addition, many in the MENA
find Russia easier to deal with---no one needs to worry about falling
afoul of a theoretical Russian equivalent of the US Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, for example. Thus, [countries turn to Moscow when they
wish to signal to Washington that they have other options if they do not
like the United States' pre-conditions.]{.underline} At the same time,
some Arab states are genuinely interested in diversifying supplies away
from the US. Indeed, after the 1991 Gulf War, several GCC states bought
Russian systems. The West should not discount Arab countries making such
decisions. Russia, unlike the America, invests effort across the MENA
region to sell weapons systems. Western analysts tend to point out
Russia could never replace the United States. Nevertheless, such views
discount another option: [Moscow does not have to replace the US. Other
authoritarian leaders can choose to move closer to Russia because the
Kremlim offers Arab states different advantages including quicker
delivery and better negotiating terms]{.underline}. When it comes to
arms sales in the MENA region, Moscow has made major inroads during the
Putin era with Iran, Syria, Egypt, Libya and Algeria, and to a lesser
extent with Turkey, Iraq, and elsewhere in the Arab Persian Gulf. It is
also making small inroads with Tunisia and Morocco.

referred to as the Ninja bomb.

[The missile was born of an emphasis, under former President Obama, on
avoiding civilian deaths in long U.S. campaign of airstrikes in
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Yemen and other
locales]{.underline}. Aside from humanitarian and legal considerations,
civilian casualties can undermine popular and allied support for U.S.
strategic goals.

But there was another reason for the weapon, officials said:
Increasingly, [terrorist fighters were adapting to U.S. airstrikes,
hiding among groups of women and children to put themselves out of
reach.]{.underline}

From Tanks to Terrorists, a Missile\'s Mission Shifted

The Hellfire, introduced as an antitank weapon in the 1980s, started
being used on drones after 9/11 to target individuals

The weapon was under development as early as 2011. A missile with
similar capabilities was considered as a \"Plan B\" to kill al Qaeda
leader Osama bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that
year, according to several of the officials.

In the end, officials opted to target bin Laden using select
special-operations force fighters who confronted and killed bin Laden .

[The weapon is used infrequently, employed only in specific
circumstances, particularly when a senior terrorist leader has been
pinpointed but other weapons would risk killing innocent bystanders, the
officials said]{.underline}. Conventional Hellfire variants are more
typically used against groups of targeted individuals or against a
so-called high-value target who is convening with other militants.

But when a lone individual is targeted, the R9X is a sought-after
weapon. The Defense Department has used it only about a half-dozen
times, officials said, including in operations in Libya, Syria, Iraq,
Yemen and Somalia.

[The Wall Street Journal was able to confirm two specific strikes in
which it was used, one by the Defense Department and one by the
CIA.]{.underline}

In January 2019, [Jamal al-Badawi , accused of being behind the bombing
of the USS Cole in 2000 in a Yemeni port, killing 17 American sailors,
was killed by an R9X fired by the Pentagon. The Pentagon has
acknowledged the strike, which occurred in Yemen]{.underline}, though
not the specific munition involved.

In February 2017, [Ahmad Hasan Abu Khayr al-Masri , an Egyptian national
who served as al Qaeda\'s No. 2, was killed in Syria\'s Idlib Province
by an R9X fired by a U.S. aircraft operated by the CIA.]{.underline} The
CIA doesn\'t acknowledge airstrikes it carries out.

The aftermath of such operations has prompted speculation about a
possible new weapon among those who were there or viewed photos. The
strikes bore no resemblance to the damage normally wrought by U.S.
airstrikes.

[A Hellfire, which is a little more than five feet long and weighs just
over 100 pounds, typically leaves behind mangled, burned-out shells of
vehicles]{.underline}, surrounded by debris and scorch marks over a
large radius.

The R9X leaves no such signature. Photographs of the aftermath of the
strike on Mr. Masri show an oblong hole torn into the roof of the car in
which he was riding. There are no burn marks suggesting an explosion.
The windshield of the Kia sedan is cracked, but the car\'s windshield
wipers are still in place.

One former U.S. official said the weapon addressed a longstanding
\"right seat, left seat\" problem, suggesting [it is theoretically
possible to kill someone sitting in the passenger seat of a moving car,
but not the driver. (Two militants reportedly were killed in the
February 2017 strike.)]{.underline}

Because of the secrecy surrounding the weapon, the Wall Street Journal
was unable to learn certain details about it, including its precise
development timeline. The CIA, Pentagon and Hellfire missile maker
Lockheed Martin Corp. declined to comment.

Development and refinement of the weapon drew impetus from [Mr. Obama\'s
policy announcement in May 2013 that set new rules for using lethal
force outside of declared war zones]{.underline} such as Afghanistan.
[When taking action, there must be \"near-certainty that no civilians
will be killed or injured,\" Mr. Obama said then.]{.underline}

[The weapon was developed \"for the express purpose of reducing civilian
casualties,\" a second former official said.]{.underline}

A third former official said [the weapon can be used when there are
doubts about the structural integrity of a building]{.underline}, such
as a mud-and-thatch hut, [where a terrorist is located. It could kill
the terrorist without collapsing the building and injuring or killing
everyone else inside, this person said.]{.underline}

#### US military innovation spurs domestic medical innovation -- Their research saves civilian lives

[Few outside the military appreciate the magnitude of these
advancements.]{.underline} Fewer still know how they were made. At every
point in this chain of care, [data were analyzed to identify needed
changes and to evaluate the success of new practices. This iterative
process produced improvement in survival and outcomes over the course of
the wars.]{.underline} Today, thousands of US and coalition troops are
alive who would have died in prior wars. Moreover, most of the wounded
have recovered enough to return to duty or transition to productive
lives in the civilian world.

Looking forward, it is vital to sustain the military health system's
capacity to innovate. Generals and admirals are regularly admonished not
to "fight the last war" by sticking with outdated equipment and tactics.
[Likewise, military leaders cannot assume that the health care
techniques that worked well in Iraq and Afghanistan will be equally
suitable in a war with a capable, "near-peer" adversary equipped with
advanced weapon]{.underline}s. A large-scale conflict in Eastern Europe,
the Korean Peninsula, or the South China Sea could generate far more
casualties and pose more complex logistical challenges than anything the
US military encountered over the past 17 years. For this reason,
military medicine must not only be ready to respond; it must always be
ready to adapt and evolve.

Lessons For Civilian Medicine

Hippocrates, the father of western medicine said, "He who wishes to be a
surgeon should go to war." [In the same way that lessons learned in
Korea and Vietnam sparked the development of modern trauma centers and
civilian air ambulance services, techniques and technologies developed
during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom are improving the
care of civilians today.]{.underline} This is fitting because, in the
face of mass shootings and acts of terrorism, the lines between
"military" and "civilian" trauma are increasingly blurry.

To accelerate the pace of improvement in trauma treatment, w[e need
stronger partnerships between military and civilian trauma
systems]{.underline}. One option is t[o rotate more military surgeons,
nurses, and medics through civilian trauma centers]{.underline} so that
they can share hard-won lessons with their civilian colleagues and
sustain their skills between deployments. Another is to allow Walter
Reed National Military Medical Center and other military medical centers
to follow the lead of the Brooke Army Medical Center by participating in
civilian trauma systems. T[his would not only help entire teams of
military providers keep their edge; it would strengthen communities'
ability to handle mass casualty events.]{.underline} A combination of
both strategies is likely to work best. In [a 2016 Journal of the
American Medical Association editorial, Don Berwick and colleagues put
it this way: "Military and civilian trauma care and learning will be
optimized together, or not at all."]{.underline}

The past two decades of progress in military medicine also offer an
important lesson for the US people---that o[ur nation can]{.underline},
in fact, [change its approach to health care. If the US military can
rapidly reengineer nearly every aspect of combat casualty care while
fighting two wars on the other side of the world (and simultaneously
treating millions of beneficiaries at home), surely our \$3.3 trillion
civilian health care system can determine how to deliver substantially
better care at lower]{.underline} [cost.]{.underline}

#### That innovation independently reduces mass casualty deaths and injuries

However, in this instance, [the nearby military base is home to one of a
small lhandful of US military hospitals that also participate in their
local civilian trauma system]{.underline} (Table 1). Over 20 years ago,
Madigan Army Medical Center stepped up to fill an unmet community need
and became the only local trauma center at that time serving the
surrounding area. Before Madigan\'s trauma center verification, any
seriously injured patient in the Tacoma area was transported 50 to 70
miles north to Harborview Medical Center, the only Level I center in the
state of Washington. The Tacoma civilian health care systems
subsequently opened their own Level II trauma center, and Madigan
continues to work closely with this Tacoma Trauma Trust partnership. As
a designated Level II trauma center [Madigan is authorized by the state
of Washington to provide care to civilian patients meeting trauma center
criteria. This authorization includes the ability to respond to
disasters, multi casualty and mass-casualty events as part of the local
civilian trauma system.]{.underline} Because of this history, and
because Madigan's medical staff participate in the daily care of injured
civilians, it was routine for [this Army medical center to be a key part
of the response to this train derailment. Approximately 20 patients were
taken to Madigan for lifesaving treatment that morning, including twelve
that were admitted for medical and surgical management]{.underline} of
their injuries. The remaining bulk of patients from that event were
cared for by the Tacoma Trauma Trust group, and only two patients were
later transferred to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle for subsequent
care. [These patients received care from military health care
professionals, many of whom have honed their skills on the battlefields
of Afghanistan and Iraq, and who have deep expertise and experience with
high volume]{.underline} and high acuity trauma care during mass
casualty events. Conversely, events like this, as well as the daily
trauma cases seen at Madigan, help to achieve and maintain a level of
trauma competency and expertise that greatly contributes to military
medical readiness.

This is o[nly the latest example demonstrating the value and
bi-directional benefits of military-civilian partnerships]{.underline}.
Last October, military medical professionals from Nellis Air Force Base
responded to provide emergent care to victims of the Las Vegas,
shooting[, the worst mass shooting event in United States history. This
military response was facilitated by an existing partnership between the
US Air Force and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas]{.underline}
allowing military personnel to work alongside their civilian
counterparts at the University Medical Centeron a regular basis. The
following month in Southerland Texas, victims of one of the worst mass
shootings in US history streamed into San Antonio to receive emergent
trauma care. Roughly half of those victims were taken to San Antonio
Military Medical Center (SAMMC), the US military's only Level I trauma
center and the same installation that supported the response to
hurricane Harvey. [Many of these civilian-military partnerships exist in
one form or another across the nation, although there are few instances
where military hospitals are freestanding trauma centers that serve the
civilian community]{.underline}. In each instance, s[tate and local
governments and civilian institutions have worked with the military to
develop agreements that allow collaboratio]{.underline}n. In select
cases, Military Treatment Facilities participate fully in their local
trauma system, providing care to injured civilians. Other agreements
provide hands-on experience to military medical personnel working at
local major civilian trauma centers. [These programs have greatly
facilitated the two-way exchange of information, education, and clinical
skills between the military and civilian communities; a factor that is
arguably among the]{.underline} greatest contributors to major advances
in trauma care.

### Turns -- Humanitarian Aid

#### Airlifts and other infrastructure using military aircraft saves civilians -The US AFRICOM division provides humanitarian aid to Mozambique after disaster

[U.S. Africa Command has been allotted millions of dollars to help move
aid supplies into Mozambique]{.underline}, which was hit by the
strongest-ever cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere March 14-15.

[The Pentagon has authorized AFRICOM to conduct operations in Mozambique
up to April 15 at a cost of \$15 million, said Brig. Gen. Robert
Huston,]{.underline} the command's deputy director of operations.

[The U.S. Agency for International Development, which is the lead organ
for the operation, also has provided \$6.2 million]{.underline} so far.

Most of that money is going to [fuel and other logistical costs
associated with moving supplies long distances, with food and safe
drinking water being among the top requirements for the 1.8 million
people]{.underline} in urgent need of help.

["The speed of response is important in disasters like this and there's
a great tyranny of distance, but I'm pleased to say we've leaned forward
from the very beginning,\"]{.underline} Huston told reporters during a
teleconference Monday.

"From a neighboring country --- [Botswana --- our defense attache
recognized we needed to get boots on the ground to get an idea of what
the scale of the disaster was,\"]{.underline} Huston said. \"And so
t[hey launched one of their airplanes immediately with four people on it
to give us our initial overflight of territory so we could best target
our response."]{.underline}

The relief effort has since morphed to include a team from [Combined
Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa on the ground in Mozambique, as well as
a team in Djibouti, to help coordinate the operation.]{.underline}

[Large military aircraft are used to transport aid to a central
hub,]{.underline} and then smaller aircraft, trucks and even boats
transport supplies out to the "spokes,\" or smaller regions within an
affected area.

So far, [AFRICOM has moved 125 tons of food through airlift and
conducted 30 sorties, "and that is just the beginning,"]{.underline}
Huston said. Now that the air assets have figured out where to land and
take off, the operation will start to pick up pace.

Cmdr. Brian Patterson, the task force's lead operations officer on the
ground in Mozambique, said that a [tactical operations center was set up
in Mozambique's capital of Maputo.]{.underline} In addition to the food
and medicine, t[rucks to help deliver food deeper into the country have
been also brought in.]{.underline}

There are approximately [90 U.S. service members on the ground,
Patterson said. "That's not a hard number," he added, and more people
and assets can be brought in as needed.]{.underline}

Huston said USAID and Pentagon funding, for instance, [is part of a
contribution effort led by the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.]{.underline}

["Those are initially assessing runways, and assessing capabilities of
off-loading and on-loading aircraft and the most efficient ways to
deliver cargo,"]{.underline} he added.

The runway in Maputo is currently fully functional with plenty of open
space for C-17s to land. The C-130 flights out to other runways in
places like Chimoio and Beira lack full refueling capability.

Because many roads are not functional, AFRICOM will have to lean on the
United Nations, which "has the lead on managing logistics,\" said Bryan
Hunt, U.S. Embassy Mozambique deputy chief of mission.

"We are focusing primarily on trying to get things to their bases of
operation,\" Hunt said. \"From there, they're using a variety of assets
--- boats, helicopters, small aircraft --- where roads are impassable to
get equipment out."

[The U.S. is also helping with the public health situation in the
country, where emergency workers are trying to contain outbreaks of
cholera and malaria,]{.underline} Hunt said.

[Most U.S. assets in-country are already "heavily tilted to the health
sector,\"]{.underline} he added, "and we've been able to mobilize many
of those assets and relationships we've built over a long period of
time."

[Vaccines for cholera or other medicine does help, officials said.
However getting local schools and health centers back up and operational
is what will prevent a protracted crisis.]{.underline}

### Turns -- Food Production

#### Ag innovation spurred by defense industry tech knowledge and helps increase yields -- Case IH and worker knowledge prove

**Fiedelholtz, 6/16/19**

\[Sara, the editor of Fort Wayne Magazine, The Journal Gazette, "Farming
technology a growing field," written 6/16/2019,
<http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/20190616/farming-technology-a-growing-field>,
accessed 6/28/2019, EHS-AGS//\]

[Starting in the 1990s, farmers began focusing on precision agriculture
and farming technology that allowed for the use of wireless data
communication]{.underline}, connectivity and internet solutions to
reduce spoilage, monitor irrigation, manage soil, collect data from
weather stations and easily track goods and assets.

According to a recent study by [Hexa Reports, precision agriculture is
set to grow to \$43.4 billion by 2025.]{.underline}

[Today\'s farming technological advancements include daily GPS-guided
satellite imagery, field monitoring on auto-drive tractors for more
cost-effective seed planting, fertilizing and nutrient application and
accurately managing field variations to grow more while using fewer
resources]{.underline} and reducing production costs.

[Redline Equipment and Case IH Agriculture is making sure it is keeping
up with farming advancements]{.underline} and capabilities it offers to
its clients by establishing its own precision farming test plot to try
precision farming technologies. The company is a full-service
agriculture equipment solutions provider serving Indiana, Ohio and
Michigan.

Redline Equipment\'s goal is to find ways to make growing crops more
accurate and controlled. Key [components]{.underline} of its farm
management testing program include the use of information technology
a[nd methods such as GPS guidance, control systems, sensors, robotics,
drones, autonomous vehicles, variable rate technology, GPS-based soil
sampling, automated hardware, telematics, and software.]{.underline}

Under the direction of [Redline\'s Precision Farming manager Arik
Witker,]{.underline} in 2018, the [precision farming team created a
5-acre test farm.]{.underline} The farm site provided the opportunity to
establish [nine trials]{.underline} for planting and g[rowing corn using
only precision planting and farming]{.underline} technologies.

To allow farmers to be involved and see the entire farming process from
land preparation through harvest, Witker and his team kept video
diaries.

"We used secret seeds, fertilizer and nutrients, so as not to brand the
plot," Witker said. "All phases of farming utilized precision farming
equipment from field mapping to auto-drive planters."

On its test farm, Redline used equipment automation, drone-based
nutrient application and hybrid or electric machinery. According to a
recent study conducted by consulting company Roland Berger, these types
of technological advances and farming capabilities are trending toward
more widespread use by farmers.

[**Witker, who spent 17 years in the National Guard working with
satellites and radio communications,** continues to focus on deploying
current precision farming technologies and preparing ways to test new
and upcoming innovations.]{.underline}

"What we tried to do is provide farmers and growers with the opportunity
to see how precision farming works and the technology\'s practical
implications," said Redline CEO Zach Hetterick, who has more than 20
years\' experience working with equipment manufacturer Case IH
Agriculture, a division of Redline Equipment.

One of Case IH\'s newest products is the Advanced Farming Systems
Connect software, a farm management system that provides total real-time
access and control on any device for farmers and growers to their
equipment -- location, diagnostics, fuel and engine stats.

"A single Case IH AFS display serves as the control center for equipment
and works seamlessly across all of our product lines. The software
allows for viewing, managing and analyzing all of a farm\'s precision
farming data," Hetterick said.

Redline also offers an innovative precision farming support program
system, AgriSync, a third-party application that helps simplify
communication between Redline\'s advisers and their customers. This
mobile agricultural support platform allows the advisers to see, track
and problem solve.

"We now have the capability from our smartphones to video conference
with the growers. This allows our advisers to see what the growers are
seeing in real-time and provide immediate solutions," Hetterick said.

[As technology continues to connect the moving parts -- precision
farming,]{.underline} satellite agriculture and/or site-specific crop
management that allow for observing, [measuring and responding to
variabilities in crops will continue to move farming\'s future
forward.]{.underline}

In the auditorium o[f Kassar House at Brown University on Thursday, Aug.
16, a group of more than 100 military officers, scholars, medical
practitioners, humanitarian response experts and others gathered to kick
off the third annual Civilian-Military Humanitarian Response
Workshop.]{.underline} The workshop series is designed to [bring
civilians and members of the military together to discuss]{.underline}
how to best respond to [humanitarian emergencies ranging from natural
disasters and pandemics]{.underline} to the provision of medical care in
war zones.

"This is a real partnership across academic, civil and military
organizations, and it's a partnership that we need," said Brown
University President Christina Paxson.

Noting the b[readth of expertise in the room, which was filled with
civilians and members of the military]{.underline} who have [worked
in]{.underline} global hotspots from [Chechnya to Mosul, Paxson
emphasized the importance of ensuring that educational institutions work
in concert with the military so that responses to humanitarian crises
are not developed in a vacuum.]{.underline}

"This is the perfect opportunity for people who are working on the
ground to help us put together [a research agenda that can advance
knowledge and understanding on the issues that they're working
with,"]{.underline} Paxson said. "We have the potential here to really
move forward and [create the networks that let us do humanitarian
response better than we have in the past."]{.underline}

Organized by [Brown's Humanitarian Innovation Initiative (HI2), the U.S.
Naval War College, the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and the United
Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs,]{.underline} the workshop series has spurred the formation of
seven working groups whose participants stay in touch throughout the
year, according to Adam Levine, professor of medicine at Brown and the
director of HI2. HI2 is housed at the Watson Institute for International
and Public Affairs.

The [working groups focus on topics like climate change and sea level
rise, corruption in humanitarian response and international humanitarian
law, among others.]{.underline} The collaborators in those groups have
been working together since the first workshop in 2016, generating
projects and new areas of research.

"We really welcome everyone to utilize the ideas that come out of this
and build upon it," Levine said. "We're creating a forum that will allow
for multiple areas of scholarship to grow out of this so t[hat
scholarship will eventually be able to improve the delivery of
humanitarian aid around the world."]{.underline}

## India DA 

### 1NC -- DA

#### Exports are a major determinant of our relationship with India

in Washington\
Dinshaw, \"US Arm Sales to India,\" Jul 8,
www.eastwestcenter.org/sites/default/files/private/apb271.pdf

[[Arms sales are a major]{.mark} component of America's strategic
[partnership with India]{.mark}]{.underline}. How extensive are these
sales? Answers to this fundamental question vary widely. Illustrating
this, in February, the Jane's defense analysis group noted that India
was the leading purchaser of American weapons during the previous year;
the media reported this under the headline "India becomes biggest
foreign buyer of US weapons." In contrast, in March, the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) noted that Russia
accounted for 75 percent and the US supplied just 7 percent of India's
military imports. Which perspective is more accurate? Neither, because
both look at arms deliveries rather than arms orders, and they only
cover select years. When analyzing India's arms orders over a more
appropriate period, from 2001 to 2013, a more nuanced picture emerges:
[while [India]{.mark} is not usually among the top five markets for the
US defense industry, it [is increasingly ordering]{.mark} greater
[quantities of American]{.mark} military [hardware, and the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is India's third-largest source of
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[New Delhi's defense [procurements]{.mark} from the United States [are
worth]{.mark} a substantial [\$15 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
comparison, US defense sales to its Asia-Pacific allies Australia,
Japan, and South Korea, and to Middle East partners Israel, Qatar, and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), were \$20 billion to \$30 billion, while
those to Saudi Arabia were over \$60 billion. Second, the United States
is India's third-largest defense supplier, accounting for about one-
fifth of its military imports. India's arms orders from the United
States, valued at \$15 billion, were somewhat less than those from
Russia---nearly \$30 billion---and France---\$20 billion--- but greater
than those from Israel---\$10 billion---and the United Kingdom---\$4
billion. Third, [contrary to prevailing perspectives about a downturn in
US-India relations under the Obama administration, US [defense sales to
India]{.mark} have [increased]{.mark} during this time]{.underline}.
From 2001 to 2004, New Delhi's arms imports from the United States were
\$400 million. India then purchased 12 Raytheon Firefinder artillery
radars valued at \$200 million, 20 General Electric GE-F404 engines for
India's light combat aircraft at a cost of \$100 million, and ten GE-LM-
2500 gas turbines for Indian naval ships costing \$60 million.

Security Dialogue or Quad, an informal annual gathering that ran for
three years from 2007 that focused on China's growing economic and
military influence in Asia.

would also occur]{.mark}]{.underline}, only in more unstable and
dangerous forms. It is important to discuss why [[China\'s
neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline} tolerate-indeed, even [[welcome-U.S.
security]{.mark} hegemony in the region]{.underline} and why, by
contrast, [these same countries would strongly resist Chinese
hegemony.]{.underline} There is a structural reason why this is so, and
it relates to geography and is therefore enduring: [China is a large
neighbor in the region and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is not.]{.underline} [Because the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has to project its presence across a vast ocean,
it requires the permission of most countries in the region to continue
its role as the security hegemon.]{.underline} The United States
requires bases, access rights, and negotiated agreements with local
governments to fulfill its security guarantees. [If these governments
withdrew their permission due,]{.underline} say, to [bad American
behavior, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would find it
difficult and costly to sustain its presence]{.underline} across the
ocean in the face of broad resistance. [China,]{.underline} by contrast,
[is a permanent presence in the region that the neighbors can never
dislodge]{.underline}. [[Should China engage in the same bad behavior,
these countries cannot make China go away. They can only **fight or
accept China\'s treatment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} It is therefore
easier for the countries in the region to enter into a security contract
with an outside power, knowing they have some bargaining leverage and an
escape clause. [When dealing with a powerful neighbor like China that
isn\'t going anywhere, the only way to achieve the same bargaining
leverage is to match that neighbor\'s power]{.underline}, especially its
military power. And [that implies arms races and spiraling security
dilemmas]{.underline}.10 Thus, [hegemons are not all created
equal]{.underline}. [It is easier to strike a bargain with an outside
hegemon than with a local one]{.underline}-an immutable reason why the
U.S. security presence will be welcome in the region. Even more
crucially, [U]{.underline}.[S. service as the region\'s security hegemon
is much more likely to result in stability than if the region were left
alone to find its own stable structure]{.underline} (more on this
below}. Adding to America\'s attractiveness as an outsider are [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' seven-decade [record of
keeping the region\'s commons open for all and its not having
territorial disputes with countries in the region.]{.underline} [The
logic behind why most countries in the region welcome the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the security hegemon, and
why most would resist China attempting to play the same role, is a
strong argument for maintaining this arrangement.]{.underline} Which
brings us to Global Trends\' second pathway, the Hobbesian scramble for
security, as the most likely outcome should the United States opt to
reduce its costs by withdrawing from the region. As this chapter will
later explore, [[this outcome would very likely **trigger multisided
missile and nuclear arms races** across the region]{.mark}, with
unpredictable and unstable consequences]{.underline}. The risk of
military disaster inside the most important economic region in the world
would rise abruptly. [[**The U.S. economy** and standard of living would
not escape the risks and costs of these developments]{.mark}. It is easy
to see how the absence of the United States as an outside security
provider could result in a dangerously unstable security competition in
East Asia.]{.underline} [[The rapid rise of China\'s military power
would create the logic for an **offsetting alliance by most of its
neighbors**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Some however (perhaps, e.g., a future
unified Korea) may choose to bandwagon with China instead, especially if
historical grievances make allying with some of China\'s adversaries
politically unacceptable[. [Bandwagoning]{.underline}]{.mark} [by some
[would increase the **security anxiety**]{.mark} of the remainder that
don\'t.]{.underline} Finally, some significant powers (e.g., Russia)
might choose to remain unaligned, which would compound the region\'s
uncertainty because the players would have to ponder how these neutrals
would eventually act during a regional crisis[. Should one or more
countries conclude that stability was unachievable and conflict
inevitable, the calculation would then turn to the logic of security
trends and time pressure and the **possible advantage gained by striking
first** rather than waiting for adversaries to grow even stronger in the
future.]{.underline}

#### Arms control are a driving factor in the US-India relationship

**ACA 2018** -- Arms Control Association\
\"US Elevates India\'s Defense Trade Status,\" Sep 1,
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-09/news-briefs/us-elevates-india's-defense-trade-status

[The United States]{.underline}, the world's largest arms exporter,
[elevated India, the world's largest arms importer]{.underline}, [to
Strategic Trade Authorization-1]{.underline} (STA-1) status, [putting it
in the same tier as the United States' NATO allies]{.underline}.

[India's STA-1 status]{.underline}, announced July 30[, will
significantly ease export controls for high-tech sales and allow India
to access the latest U.S. defense technology]{.underline}. It will also
potentially serve U.S. interests in allaying risks associated with
China's rapid military expansion and by reducing Russian arms business
on the subcontinent, while making it easier for U.S. arms manufacturers
to compete in the Indian market.

"STA-1 provides India with greater supply-chain efficiency, both for
defense and for other high-tech products...and it will reduce the time
and resources needed to get licensing approved," said U.S. Commerce
Secretary Wilbur Ross, announcing the decision at the Indo-Pacific
Business Forum in Washington. "We calculate that it will be a
competitive advantage for the U.S. in providing those kinds of products
to India." The change would have affected about \$9.7 billion in exports
over the last seven years, according to the Commerce Department.

[India also received a sanctions waiver]{.underline} for the U.S.
Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA[) through
an amendment in the N]{.underline}ational [D]{.underline}efense
[A]{.underline}uthorization [A]{.underline}ct for fiscal year 2019. [The
waiver will relieve India from punitive measures it would have otherwise
experienced for importing weapons systems from Russia.]{.underline} In
the past, India has explicitly denounced country-specific U.S. sanctions
and rejected U.S. demands that it not buy the Russian S-400 long-range
missile system. \"We have told the U.S. Congress delegation \[that
visited India\] that this is U.S. legislation and not a UN law," Indian
Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.

The U.S. actions fit with the Trump administration's vision for
increased arms sales, but how they fit with India\'s major push for a
U.S.-style private defense sector of its own remains to be seen.

#### The US is crowding out Russia, but that can always change 

**Business Standard 2018** \"US narrows gap with top supplier Russia,
arms sales to India soar 5-fold,\" Mar 17,
https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/us-narrows-gap-with-top-supplier-russia-arms-sales-to-india-soar-5-fold-118031700139_1.html

As New Delhi diversifies its arms purchases, the US is rapidly
increasing its arms sales to India, emerging over the last five years as
its second biggest supplier by providing 15 per cent of its weapons
imports, a study by Sipri said.

[Washington increased its sales by more than five times compared to the
previous five years]{.underline}, the authoritative Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute said in its report released this
week.

Israel has moved up to the third spot accounting for 11 per cent of
India\'s imports during the 2013-17 calendar years, Sipri added.

[Although Russia remained by far India\'s biggest arms seller, it share
of total imports has fallen]{.underline}.

Russia had a 62 per cent share of India\'s arms imports during the past
five years, down from 79 per cent in 2008-12, according to the report
that tracks the global arms trade.

Overall, [India is the world\'s biggest importer of major arms
accounting for 12 per cent of the total global imports during the last
five years and it increased purchases abroad by 24 per cent]{.underline}
compared to the previous five-year period, Sipri said.

\"[The tensions between India]{.underline}, on the one side, and
Pakistan and China, on the other, [are fuelling India\'s growing demand
for major weapons]{.underline}, which it remains unable to produce
itself, Sipri Senior Researcher Siemon Wezeman wrote.

### 1NR -- Containment Good

#### Containment is necessary to solve Chinese aggression and nuclear war

**Pickrell 2015** - Master's in IR, currently pursuing a PhD in IR and
Diplomacy at Central China Normal University\
Ryan, \"The Tipping Point: Has the U.S.-China Relationship Passed the
Point of No Return?,\" Oct 25,
nationalinterest.org/feature/the-tipping-point-has-the-us-china-relationship-passed-the-14168?page=3

Conflict between a rising power and an established power is not
inevitable as most realist scholars suggest. However, in every
relationship, [there is a tipping point]{.underline} or a point of no
return, [and China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are
rapidly approaching this]{.underline} point. As traditional diplomatic
outlets have done little to resolve the more challenging issues
presently affecting the Sino-American relationship, these two great
powers have been increasingly relying on their military capabilities and
hard power tactics. That's especially true [in [the
S]{.mark}]{.underline}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea, which [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of
[[the]{.mark} single [greatest]{.mark} points of
[contention]{.mark}]{.underline} between China and the United States.
While there is a realization on both sides of the Pacific that a kind of
strategic stability is necessary to prevent great power conflict, [both
[China and the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[remain unwilling to compromise]{.underline} [and make
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [kind of meaningful [concessions required to
move the relationship further from confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}
and conflict and closer to cooperation and rapprochement. Instead, these
two countries are drawing lines in the sand and preparing for the worst.
Failed pursuit of strategic stability China's proposed solution to the
Sino-American strategic stability issue is the "new model of
major-country relations," which encourages the United States and China
to avoid confrontation and conflict, respect one another's political
systems and national interests---specifically China's core
interests---and pursue win-win cooperation. China is exceptionally
enthusiastic about this proposal and brings it up at every high-level
Sino-American meeting. Chinese enthusiasm for the "new model of
major-country relations" can be explained in a number of different ways.
[[American acceptance of China's proposal would]{.mark} facilitate
Beijing's rise[, legitimize the]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese Communist
Party [([CCP) as a leader]{.underline}]{.mark} [for national strength
and revival and reduce the likelihood of American
containment]{.underline}. As acceptance of the "new model of
major-country relations" would create an international environment
conducive to China's rise, it would essentially allow China to become
the preeminent power in Asia without great power competition or
conflict. This proposal also has the potential to put China on par with
the United States, to elevate it to an equal status, one acknowledged by
the United States. [Not only would American recognition of China's
strength and power have effects abroad, but [it would also **stoke
Chinese nationalism and strengthen CCP leadership at
home**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, this new model is a means of
establishing a new code of conduct for the Sino-American relationship
that is more in line with Chinese national interests, opening the door
for the creation of a Chinese sphere of influence in Asia and,
potentially, a Sino-centric regional order. Prior to the recent meeting
between Xi Jinping and Barack Obama, Xi announced that China's proposed
"new model of major-country-relations" would be an important discussion
point for the meeting, but, while this proposal was brought up during
the meeting, no clear progress was made. Because U.S. leaders believe
that the "new model of major-country relations" is not in America's best
interests, the United States has repeatedly dismissed China's proposal.
As the hegemonic power, the United States maintains its power by
dominating global politics; to accept a geopolitical framework
alternative proposed by a strategic rival requires sacrificing a certain
amount of power and influence. Along those same lines, [acceptance of
[China's proposal might give other states]{.mark} in the international
system [the impression that the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is in decline and on the losing end of
the classic "Thucydides trap."]{.mark}]{.underline} Outside of
traditional power politics, the call for the United States to respect
China's "core interests"--- as many Chinese and foreign scholars have
noted---is a loaded statement. While the United States is not opposed to
respecting a state's national interests, it tends to be unwilling to
respect national interests which are highly contested, which is the
situation for the majority of China's "core interests[." In addition
to]{.underline} [[traditional Chinese national interests, such as
**Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Tibet, and Xinjiang, [China's "core
interests" [also]{.mark} **[cover most of its territorial claims in
Asia]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The United States is concerned that
[[China's "new model]{.mark} of major-country relations" [is a
ploy]{.mark} designed [to trick the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[into acknowledging China's extensive
territorial claims and undercutting the interests
of]{.mark}]{.underline} American [a[llies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
long-time strategic partners in the Asia-Pacific region, which would
likely result in the [weakening of the American-led "hub-and-spoke"
security structure]{.underline}, a security framework China hopes to
replace with its New Asian Security Concept. There are also suspicions
in the United States that China's proposal is a call for the creation of
spheres of influence, a concept to which the Obama administration has
been consistently opposed. America's approach to Sino-American strategic
stability is to have China and the United States focus on cooperation
and agree to avoid letting competition in one area affect cooperation
and collaboration in others. In many ways, this resembles China's old
"shelving disputes and pursuing joint development" strategy for Asia. As
this kind of strategy is the geopolitical equivalent of sweeping dirt
under the rug, it is only effective to a point. Eventually, the dirt
spills out. Sooner or later, unaddressed problems surface. At best, this
approach is only a temporary stop on the road to functional strategic
stability. At worst, this approach has already outlived its usefulness.
China views this strategy as an attempt by the United States to avoid
addressing China's demands that the United States acknowledge China's
rise to great power status and redefine the relationship accordingly,
which only encourages the already strong Chinese desire to push forward
the "new model of major-country relations." China and the United States
are at an impasse regarding strategic stability. [While both states have
made commitments and promises to prevent great power conflict, neither
China nor the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has developed a
reasonable or implementable solution for Sino-American strategic
stability.]{.underline} Thus, competition continues unmanaged, unchecked
and confrontation is steadily evolving into conflict. Drawing Lines in
the "Sea" The problems pushing the Sino-American relationship towards
conflict are numerous and diverse, but if you are looking for the issue
most likely to cause conflict, you need look no further than the South
China Sea. China perceives the territorial disputes in this area as
issues in which aggressive foreign state actors led by the United States
are threatening China's territorial sovereignty. For China, because of
its history, territorial sovereignty issues implicate regime survival in
a way that transcends all other quarrels and disagreements. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, on the other
hand, [[views China's territorial claims]{.mark} and actions to bolster
those claims [as]{.mark} Chinese expansionism, [aggression
against]{.mark} American [allies]{.mark} and strategic
partners]{.underline}, and a threat to the guiding principles of the
liberal world order---which the United States views as crucial for the
preservation of America's global hegemonic power. The situation in the
South China Sea has been steadily escalating for several years now. In
April, 2014, American defense secretary Chuck Hagel met with Chinese
defense minister Chang Wanquan. During the meeting, Hagel said, "All
parties should refrain from provocative actions and the use of
intimidation, coercion, or aggression to advance their claims. Such
disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with
international law." Chang replied, "I'd like to reiterate that the
territorial sovereignty issue is a Chinese core interest. On this issue,
we will make no compromises, no concessions. Not even a tiny bit of
violation will be allowed." The inability to discuss openly or
compromise on this issue has made it impossible to resolve and has led
to escalation and increased tension. In the aftermath of this meeting,
China began investing heavily in island construction and land
reclamation activities in disputed waters. As these activities have
stirred up a lot of dust in the region, the United States has demanded
that China abandon its present course of action, insisting that it is
provocative and negatively impacting regional peace and stability. [Not
only has [China dismissed America's demands, it]{.mark} has also
[increased its military presence in contested areas]{.mark} in order to
establish anti-access zones]{.underline}. While China claims that its
actions are within the scope of international law, the United States
asserts that Chinese actions are in violation of the law of the sea and
laws for the regulation of the international commons. China argues that
the South China Sea issue is a territorial sovereignty issue, yet the
United States regards this issue as a freedom of navigation dispute, as
well as a fight for the preservation of the international legal
system---a cornerstone for the American-led liberal world order. In
August of this year, the United States launched its new Asia-Pacific
Maritime Security Strategy, which aims "to safeguard the freedom of the
seas, deter conflict and escalation, and promote adherence to
international law and standards." The Asia-Pacific region is now at the
heart of the American naval security agenda. In response, Chinese
foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said that China "opposes any
country's attempt to challenge China's territorial sovereignty and
security under the pretext of safeguarding navigation freedom."
Responding to Chinese criticisms of America's new regional maritime
security strategy, American Defense Secretary Ashton Carter stated,
"Make no mistake, we will fly, sail, and operate wherever international
law permits...We will do that at times and places of our choosing." In
2014, the United States carried out "freedom of navigation" exercises in
various parts of the world and challenged the territorial claims of 18
different countries; however, the United States has yet to officially
challenge China's claims in the South China Sea. But, that may soon
change, as the United States is currently considering sending American
naval vessels within 12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands in
order to force China to end its land reclamation activities. Such plans
are considered aggressive, dangerous and extremely provocative by the
Chinese. A recent Global Times editorial read, "China mustn't tolerate
rampant US violations of China's adjacent waters and the skies over
these expanding islands. The Chinese military should be ready to launch
countermeasures according to Washington's level of provocation." The
article further stated, "If the US encroaches on China's core interests,
the Chinese military will stand up and use force to stop it." The
article stated plainly, "If the US adopts an aggressive approach, it
will breach China's bottom line, and China will not sit idly by." Other
reports from this newspaper, a state-sponsored Chinese media outlet,
have made it clear that [[if the bottom line for the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is that China must end all of its land reclamation
activities in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea, then [war
is inevitable]{.mark}, which suggests that this issue may be the tipping
point for the Sino-American relationship]{.underline}. How the United
States and China choose to move forward on this issue will permanently
redefine the relationship between these two great powers. Granted, this
may just be saber rattling, but even if that is the case, **[[this issue
is still decidedly zero-sum]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[which increases
the likelihood of conflict.]{.underline} [[For China,]{.mark} [political
preservation and]{.mark} [a]{.mark} potential [Chinese sphere of
influence]{.mark} [are on the line,]{.mark} [and for the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [the liberal
world order and [American hegemony are at stake.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Sooner or later, this trying issue will need to be resolved, and
regardless of whether it is resolved through diplomacy or military
force, it will take a toll on the geopolitical influence of either one
or both countries. Were the international institutions for collective
security strong enough to handle situations like this when they
arise---and if China and the United States were willing to establish a
new relationship model which addresses each country's respective
security concerns and encourages effective collaboration---it might
actually be possible to resolve this issue peacefully. But given current
circumstances, this is little more than idealism and wishful thinking.
As [**[there is currently no clear solution to this problem that would
allow both countries to walk out of this situation with their heads held
high]{.mark}**, these two states are pondering the
unthinkable]{.underline}. Depending on each country's level of
commitment and resolve, this situation may have already passed the
tipping point. [The outcome of the geopolitical power struggle between
China and the United States will almost certainly be decided in the
South China Sea]{.underline}. Some have suggested that the South China
Sea issue is not a Sino-American issue. On the contrary, it is the most
pressing Sino-American issue. [[One side will either choose to back down
or be forced to back down.]{.mark} No matter how everything plays out in
the South China Sea, geopolitics in the Asia-Pacific region will never
be the same again.]{.underline}

### 1NR -- Indian Fear

#### That causes India to first-strike, causes an escalatory nuclear war

Kelley **Sayler** 7-22-20**11**; research assistant, CSIS, "Nuclear
Stability in South Asia", 201 ,
http://csis.org/blog/nuclear-stability-south-asia

The convergence of a number of factors in South Asia -- including
[strategic anxieties]{.underline}, [destabilizing military doctrines,
and conventional force disparities -- places the region in growing
danger]{.underline} **[of succumbing to a nuclear arms
race.]{.underline}** Such was the conclusion of a recent SIPRI report
that cited India and Pakistan's parallel expansion of fissile material
production capacity and nuclear infrastructure as evidence of the
countries' progressive descent into nuclear competition. Indian,
Pakistani, and American experts gathered to discuss this development, as
well as other topics in South Asian security, at a Monday event hosted
by the United States Institute for Peace. Opening the discussion, Vijay
Shankar, former Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Strategic Forces
Command, offered an overview of India's nuclear sizing requirements.
Shankar stated that India's policy of No First Use allows it to maintain
a minimal arsenal -- the precise size of which is dictated by
credibility and survivability concerns - that provides the country with
a cost-effective means of deterrence. Shankar then noted India's
interest in preserving minimum deterrence, a policy that is further
supported by India's recognition of a point of diminishing returns in
nuclear sizing. It is not at all clear, however, that India possesses
the political will to sustain such a policy in the face of ever-growing
strategic cooperation between China and Pakistan. To be sure, [India's
nuclear sizing requirements are]{.underline}, as Shankar conceded,
[driven by multilateral considerations]{.underline}, which are **[almost
certain in the long-term to reflect India's discomfort with China's
"string of pearls" strategy]{.underline}** [for **expanding PRC
influence into the Indian Ocean** and South China Sea. India is also
unlikely to be particularly heartened by the prospect of a joint
Chinese-Pakistani naval base operating in its neighborhood or by reports
of a steadily expanding Pakistani arsenal]{.underline}. For its part,
Pakistan has similarly committed to maintaining a policy of minimum
deterrence. But the comments of Shankar's Pakistani counterpart, Shahzad
Chaudhry, former Air Vice Marshall of the Pakistani Air Force, would
seem to belie this intention. Chaudhry noted that [India's robust
economic growth rate has enabled it to aggressively modernize its
military forces]{.underline}. [As a result, conventional force disparity
has widened, prompting Pakistan to increase its reliance on nuclear
weapons as a means of achieving strategic parity]{.underline}. It was
this policy, Chaudhry argued, that prevented the Kargil War from
escalating into a nuclear exchange. But given this emphasis on
maintaining strategic parity, it would seem that Pakistan's nuclear
sizing requirements will be driven more by India's force posture than by
any inherent comfort with the theory of minimum deterrence. And as India
continues to develop its conventional capabilities - and to uphold the
Cold Start doctrine, which many Pakistani experts believe is intended to
generate space for a limited war - it seems reasonable to expect that
Pakistani nuclear forces will expand in kind. Indeed, Pakistan's
development of the nuclear-capable Hatf-9 would seem to indicate an
interest in both growing and diversifying the country's arsenal, thereby
moving it away from a policy of minimum deterrence. Following Shankar
and Chaudhry's discussion of the potential for a South Asian nuclear
build-up, Jamshed Hashmi, Chairman Emeritus of Pakistan Nuclear
Regulatory Authority, continued with a presentation on the relationship
between civilian and military nuclear programs. Hashmi argued that there
has always been a separation between these programs in Pakistan, but
that separation in India is insufficient to ensure the absence of
material diversion. In addition, Hashmi denounced the U.S.-India Civil
Nuclear Agreement, saying that it legitimized the use of nuclear power
plants for non-peaceful purposes. Toby Dalton of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace then highlighted the intimate connection between
nuclear energy and nuclear weapons/doctrine in South Asia. While
Pakistan's nuclear energy needs are different from those of India's, he
argued, both states desire the prestige that is associated with having
advanced nuclear technology and, for this reason, will continue to seek
to legitimize their respective nuclear programs. Given this condition,
as well as the likely expansion of regional arsenals, nuclear security
and transparency measures will be increasingly important to implement in
the coming years. In contrast to the South Asian discussants, Dalton was
pessimistic about the prospects for escalation control in the event of a
future crisis and questioned the assumption that the presence of nuclear
weapons had had a moderating effect on the Kargil War. He instead argued
that [**time pressures** and the **lack of reliable dialogue channels**
will increase the potential for **misperception in future
crises**]{.underline}. Dalton additionally noted the possibility that
sustained American discussion of Pakistani nuclear security could
exacerbate fears of a disarming first strike, thereby driving the
country to adopt a higher alert posture and/or to disperse its nuclear
arsenal. Such [actions could further destabilize an already tenuous
relationship.]{.underline}

#### Any restriction on exports to India will cause them to look for different sellers

**Economist 2018** \"The global arms trade is booming. Buyers are
spoiled for choice,\" Aug 18,
https://www.economist.com/international/2018/08/18/the-global-arms-trade-is-booming-buyers-are-spoiled-for-choice

China has long been better known as a buyer of arms, mainly from Russia,
than as a seller. A big share of its arms deliveries have gone to close
allies such as Pakistan. But it has enormously increased its capacity to
make and sell its own weapons, including ships and submarines.

Meanwhile[, American arms-export policy has been a delicate balance
between]{.underline}, on the one hand[, seizing economic and
geopolitical opportunity and,]{.underline} on the other, [being careful
not to share technologies which could destabilise war zones]{.underline}
or be used against the United States.

But **[such caution can be counter-productive]{.underline}**. At a panel
discussion in Washington this month, a defence-industry advocate
lamented that, [because of America's technology-transfer curbs, France
had won from it a contract to sell airborne radar to India. "I like the
French, but I like American industry even more,"]{.underline} he
grumbled.

In another Franco-American contest over technology, France is finding it
hard to sell more Rafale combat aircraft to its prize arms customer,
Egypt, because the accompanying Scalp cruise missile incorporates
American know-how, the transfer of which to third parties is barred.
France has promised to develop its own technology, but Egypt may not
have the patience to wait. Egypt's government has also been a keen
purchaser of Russian equipment, including aircraft and attack
helicopters.

For defence-equipment manufacturers such as Britain and France, export
sales matter ever more as a way to maintain their own industries.
Britain's edge in military aviation may depend on its sales to Saudi
Arabia. And the Royal Navy's ambitious building programme got a boost
when Australia said it would buy British for a new range of frigates.
France wants to develop a new air-to-air missile, but only, as Florence
Parly, the defence minister, put it, if it can get foreign customers.

Such desperation adds to the frenzy of market competition. So does the
utter indifference Russia and China display towards their customers'
human-rights policies. So too does the growth in the number of countries
that have graduated from being mainly buyers of weapons and knowhow to
sellers---Turkey, the Emirates and South Korea, for example.

Japan, which boasts a huge defence industry, is entirely new to the
market. It plunged in when the government lifted restrictions on arms
exports in 2014. It competes, albeit from a fairly weak position, with
China for Asia-Pacific customers.

As for Russia, SIPRI calculates that its share of the global market has
slipped (to about 22% in 2013-17). But it offers a blend of
tried-and-tested hardware and, to a few customers, superb know-how,
especially in air defence.

That creates a dilemma for America, which hopes soon to sell weapons
worth \$6bn to India, but is dismayed by that country's determination to
acquire S-400 air-defence systems from Russia: missiles that could ward
off potential threats from China or Pakistan. Other countries intent on
continuing to buy Russian include Indonesia and Vietnam.

Jim Mattis, America's defence secretary, has implored Congress not to be
too harsh with Russia's customers, so long as they pledge gradually to
reduce their reliance. In a letter leaked in July to Breaking Defense, a
specialist news service, he told a congressman: "We are faced with a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to decrease Russia's dominance in key
regions." But that could only happen if America were free to sell its
own weapons. For customers, that means that for the foreseeable future
they can keep both American and Russian weapons in their arsenals.

[It is telling that India has recently been admitted to the Missile
Technology Control Regime, a group of countries which promises not to
help pariah states obtain ballistic missiles.]{.underline} That will
make it easier for both America and Russia to sell long-range rockets to
India. The two arms-sales giants, who do not agree on much else, have
welcomed India into the club.

#### Russia is expanding arms sales to India now -- continuing US sales is key to stop them

India has been the world's most lucrative market for arms exporters in
recent years, and was responsible for 10.3 per cent of global arms
imports between 2000 and 2016. Russia supplied 72 per cent of these
imports. [During the same period India accounted for 30 per cent of
Russian arms exports, the largest share of any country.]{.underline}
Therefore, [maintaining a large share of the Indian market is of immense
importance to Russian producers. T]{.underline}he relationship is close
and long-standing, stretching back over decades. During the Cold War,
India produced a range of Soviet weapons systems under licence,
including hundreds of MiG-21 and MiG-27 fighter aircraft. [Since 1991,
it has continued to purchase large quantities of weaponry from
Russia]{.underline}, including T-90 tanks, Konkurs-M anti-tank missiles,
R-73 air-to-air missiles, Talwar-class frigates (based on the
Krivak-class), Mi-8 transport helicopters, and even an aircraft carrier
(the INS Vikramaditya, formerly the Kiev-class carrier Admiral
Gorshkov). This close relationship does not look like ending soon. [In
October 2016, the two countries announced a deal for Russia to supply up
to \$6 billion worth of weapons,]{.underline} including the S-400
surface-to-air missile system, four Project 11356 (Admiral
Grigorovich-class) frigates, and a joint venture for the production of
Ka-226T helicopters.33 During the Cold War, India produced a range of
Soviet weapons systems under licence, including hundreds of MiG-21 and
MiG-27 fighter aircraft. Since 1991, it has continued to purchase large
quantities of weaponry from Russia. In addition to the purchase of
off-the-shelf final weapon systems and components, India enjoys the
closest defence-industrial relationship with Russia of any country
outside the former Soviet Union.34 As well as the recently announced
joint venture to produce Ka-226T helicopters, defence-industrial
enterprises from the two countries are working together to develop and
produce a wide range of weapon systems, including the Brahmos cruise
missile35 and the PAK-FA ('Perspektivny Aviatsionny Kompleks Frontovoy
Aviatsii') fifth-generation fighter aircraft.36 Close relations have
also resulted in Russia leasing to India one nuclear-powered
Shchuka-B-class attack submarine (SSN) -- the INS Chakra (formerly the
K-152 Nerpa) -- since 2012. As part of the recently announced arms deal
between the two countries, India is to lease an additional submarine of
the same type. This deal is significant because the Shchuka-B class is a
very capable system: it is quiet (i.e. it has a very low acoustic
signature) and is equipped with cruise missiles. The fact that Russia is
prepared to transfer such sensitive and capable equipment to India
vividly illustrates the importance that its leadership attaches to
sustaining its position as India's primary weapons supplier.
Nevertheless, [while Russia is dominant for now in the Indian arms
market, its position is challenged both by increasingly intense
competition from other arms exporters and by India's attempts to develop
its own defence-industrial capabilities. The US]{.underline}, for
example, [has capitalized on closer political relations with India to
conclude deals for medium and heavy transport planes]{.underline},
airborne anti-submarine systems, and Chinook transport and Apache attack
helicopters.37 Whether India is prepared to purchase US weapons outside
areas in which Russia is not as competitive is unclear, however.38 At
the same time the Indian government is pursuing an initiative known as
'Make in India', which aims to support domestic production of armaments,
among other things. This has influenced defence procurement policy. It
requires Indian components to account for at least 40 per cent of the
total used to produce indigenously developed equipment, and 60 per cent
if the equipment is designed outside India.39 [The use of joint ventures
offers -- at least partially -- a risk mitigation strategy to protect
the market shares of Russian arms exporters.]{.underline} Moreover, a
willingness to transfer advanced technology and know-how looks set to
confer competitive advantages on Russian exporters operating in India;
these advantages are likely to last for some time.

### 1NR -- Nuclear Switch

#### India perceives a border war coming, a strong deterrent is key to prevent it

R, \"Why China may be plotting a \'short\' border war with India as in
1962,\" Jun 6,
www.firstpost.com/world/why-china-may-be-plotting-a-short-border-war-with-india-as-in-1962-2281132.html

Now consider how [China may be weighing the risks and benefits of a
short war over Tawang]{.underline}. One, it will ask its lackey Pakistan
to make the entire western border hot when it wants to pressure India.
Pakistani firing and shelling of Indian positions has been not so much
on the Line of Control (LoC) but the settled international border (IB).
This has probably been done at the urgings of China. It means, when
China winks, Pakistan can make the entire Kashmir LoC and IB a live
battleground. Two, insurgency in the North-East will keep the army busy
in Nagaland and Manipur, while distracting us from Arunachal. [China\'s
calculations could revolve around a quick surgical strike to capture
Tawang]{.underline} - despite adverse terrain - or a bigger grab in
Kashmir to use as a bargaining chip to gain Tawang. [It may also be
betting that India will not fight too hard for Tawang or threaten
nuclear mayhem in retaliation.]{.underline} India has made the mistake
of not developing tactical nuclear weapons unlike Pakistan, which will
have no qualms about using them if we make territorial gains on the
western front. In essence, [China is developing a two-front war
capability vis-à-vis India and hobble it with various insurgencies -- a
Pakistan-propped one in the west, and a more covert one in the
north-east]{.underline}. The aim may be to get us to part with Tawang,
with or without a short war. [With Tawang won, China will put up a show
of \"magnanimity\" and offer to settle the border
elsewhere.]{.underline} The point is simple: [China will not see a
\"short\" border war as necessarily a bad thing. India should be more
than ready for it]{.underline}, and must lose no time preparing for it.
The key elements of our strategy should be the following: strengthen the
army\'s preparedness to defend Tawang and Ladakh at all costs and make
this obvious to China; create the new mountain corps quickly, and speed
up investment in border infrastructure; create a crash pan to develop
and deploy tactical nuclear weapons and make it clear that these will be
used only on the China border. [The paradox of Narendra Modi successful
Asian diplomacy involving China\'s rivals]{.underline} (Japan and
Vietnam specifically) is that [China may want to strike before Modi
manages to strengthen India\'s]{.underline} economy, [defences and
alliances]{.underline}. This calculation may have the adverse
consequence of making China rush into a short war before India improves
his fighting capabilities. [The only way to prevent Chinese adventurism
of the 1962 kind is to prepare for one.]{.underline}

#### This means they'll ramp up their nuclear tech

Arihant-Class Ballistic-Missile Submarine Although India has maintained
a nuclear arsenal for decades, it has lacked a credible second-strike
countervalue capability. The ability to threaten enemy strategic assets
and even cities, an insurance policy against surprise nuclear attack,
has eluded India. INS Arihant ("Destroyer of Enemies") is the first real
step toward fixing that problem. [India is only the sixth country in the
world to develop an undersea nuclear deterrent.]{.underline} INS Arihant
is India's first ballistic missile submarine, specifically designed to
launch nuclear missiles. [Arihant will carry twelve K-15 short-range
nuclear missiles or four K-4 intermediate range nuclear
missiles.]{.underline} K-15 missiles, with their 700-kilometer range,
are incapable of reaching China from the Indian Ocean. K-15 missiles,
with their 3,500-kilometer range can reach as far as Beijing. As far as
India is concerned, that is probably far enough. Arihant incorporates
aspects of Russian submarine design. It is both India's first
indigenously built ballistic-missile submarine and first indigenously
built nuclear submarine. In another first, the 83MW reactor powering the
ship is India's first shipboard nuclear reactor. Russian shipbuilders
lent extensive assistance to Indian shipbuilders, and Russian experts
assisted the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in design of the reactor.
China should not fear the Arihant per se---India has a "no first use"
nuclear policy, meaning it would not be the first to launch nuclear
missiles. Even if that policy were to change, a successful Arihant class
would only mean about twelve nuclear missiles at sea. Still, [those
twelve missiles represent the capability to do the unthinkable, and
despite stated policy that such a potential threat be taken lightly.
Arihant is nearing sea trials. Three submarines are reportedly
planned.]{.underline}

### Latin America Aff -- AT: China DA

#### Chinese influence at an all time high now

Don, \"China\'s Front Door to America\'s Backyard,\" Jun 28,
https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/chinas-front-door-to-americas-backyard/

Recently, [China has expanded its presence in the Latin America and the
Caribbean]{.underline} (LAC) region. This increasing influence was
crystallized during a state visit to Panama by Chinese President Xi
Jinping in December 2018. [Xi's 24-hour state visit to
Panama]{.underline}, the first by any Chinese head of state, [culminated
in 19 cooperation agreements in trade,]{.underline} infrastructure, and
other areas.

On the economic front, [China secured agreements on significant
infrastructure projects such as the building of a high-speed train as
well as financial service deals]{.underline} between banking
institutions to presumably fund such projects. These agreements were not
just economic and geopolitical victories for China; Xi's visit also
embodied China's ambition to pull Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies
into their orbit. In 2017, Panama shunned Taiwan in favor of relations
with China, a shift that caused a ripple effect around the region. The
Dominican Republic and El Salvador both cut ties with the island nation
in 2018.

[Xi's state visit also had significant geopolitical importance,
specifically regarding the Panama Canal]{.underline}. The canal acts as
a strategic gateway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and is an
essential passage for the world's commodities. The country of Panama
itself links Central and South America.

The geopolitical significance also lies in the shadows of historical
elements. Panama was an unincorporated territory of the United States
for the greater part of the 20th century. The U.S. also had military
installations in Panama and controlled the Panama Canal until 1999 (per
the Torrijos-Carter Treaties).

[No stranger to the power of imagery, Chinese leadership was keenly
aware of America's historical influence in Panama.]{.underline} Prior to
Xi's inaugural state visit, Chinese leaders were in talks with their
Panamanian counterparts to build the Chinese embassy near the Panama
Canal in a zone formerly controlled by the United States; thus, the
Chinese national flag would have been seen by arriving ships. However,
domestic opposition pressured the Panamanian government to shelve those
plans.

The [expansion of modern agriculture through a combination of
intensification and extensification has managed to sustain the world
population explosion]{.underline} that began with the industrial
revolution and accelerated in the early to mid twentieth century (United
Nations, 2015). For example, the prevalence of undernourishment has
declined globally (Fogel, 1997, World Bank, 2016), [while the real
prices of agricultural commodities fell quite significantly between 1950
and 2000]{.underline} (Alston and Pardey, 2014).2 However, the
ex[pansion of modern agriculture has had other, less desirable
consequences.]{.underline}

Both [agricultural intensification -- of the prevailing, non-ecological
or unsustainable variet]{.underline}y (cf. Bommarco et al., 2013,
Godfray and Garnett, 2014) -- and extensification h[ave been primary
causes of a historically unprecedented loss of global
biodiversity]{.underline}. According to the Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment (2005), the c[urrent global rate of species extinction is up
to 1000 times higher than the background rate]{.underline} that has been
estimated from the fossil record. A broader index of global biodiversity
has been in decline since 1970 (the first year for which data are
available) and there is no statistical indication that the rate of
decline is slowing (Butchart et al., 2010). L[ocal species richness is
estimated to have declined by over 10% in the last 200
years]{.underline}, [globally]{.underline} on average (Newbold et al.,
2015).

In terms of agricultural biodiversity, Khoury et al. (2014) have
documented how g[lobal crop production has become less diverse in the
last 50 years,]{.underline} in the sense that it has become more
dominated by a small number of crops. Using data from the F[ood and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), they show
that]{.underline}, while national food [supplies have come to rely on a
more diverse set of crops on average, the opposite is true of the global
food supply.]{.underline} Although this might seem paradoxical at first,
it is in fact because the same crops have been driving both greater
diversity in most countries (particularly developing countries) and
greater similarity globally: [wheat, rice, soybeans and oil crops such
as palm oil and sunflowers. These are precisely the crops we would
expect to become more prevalent as diets change with rising
incomes]{.underline} (Poleman and Thomas, 1995). In addition to
inter-specific diversity of crops, [nearly all countries reporting to
the FAO\'s global stocktake of crop genetic diversity documented the
erosion of genetic diversity,]{.underline} with the most commonly
identified causes being respectively the replacement of local varieties
as part of the modernization of production systems, and land clearing
(FAO, 1996, FAO, 2010).

Following a proliferation of research in the last 25 years, there is now
a consensus that [biodiversity at different levels increases the plant
productivity of natural ecosystems, as well as reducing the variability
of plant productivity (]{.underline}Cardinale et al., 2012). [Plant
productivity decreases more than proportionally as biodiversity is lost.
Once more than 20% of species are lost, the effects may rival other
drivers of global environmental change such as planetary warming, ozone
and acidification]{.underline} (Cardinale et al., 2012, Hooper et al.,
2012). While the negative relationship between biodiversity loss and
plant productivity is reliably found in natural ecosystems such as
grasslands, it is clearly possible for intensively managed monocultures
to be highly productive. Nonetheless a recurrent finding from empirical
studies by economists is that genetic and species diversity on farms
reduces the variability of crop yields and sometimes increases the mean
yield (see notably Di Falco, 2012, Tilman et al., 2005). This has been
found not only in low-intensity, biologically diverse farming systems
such as Ethiopia (Di Falco and Chavas, 2009, Di Falco et al., 2010) and
Pakistan (Smale et al., 1998), but also in high-intensity,
low-biodiversity farming systems such as the East of England (Omer et
al., 2007).

There are [several reasons why more biologically diverse farming systems
would display lower yield variability, and sometimes higher mean
yields.]{.underline} These include sy[mbiotic interactions and
resource-use complementarities between species]{.underline}, as well as
[statistical averaging between species that respond]{.underline}
differently [to exogenous shocks such as extreme weather,]{.underline}
pests and pathogens (Tilman, 1999). This is a portfolio effect
(Baumgärtner, 2007) that is also provided within crop species by
[genetic diversity.]{.underline} In the ecological literature, there is
a particular emphasis on how biologically diverse [farming systems can
be less vulnerable to pests and pathogens thanks to these kinds of
mechanism]{.underline}. Pests and pathogens have a very significant
impact on global crop yields, with direct losses estimated to be in the
range of 20 to 40% (Oerke, 2006, Savary et al., 2012). A famous example
is the potato famine of 1845-8 that contributed to 1.5 million deaths in
Ireland. Furthermore, expanding the agricultural land area reduces the
extent of natural reserve lands, so that the pool of genetic material
that can potentially be used as an input to agricultural R&D activities
decreases (Simpson et al., 1996, Rausser and Small, 2000).

In this work we explore the implications of global biodiversity loss,
caused by the expansion of modern agriculture, for agricultural
production itself. At the extensive margin, [the conversion of natural
lands into modern agriculture is undertaken with the intention of
increasing the production of food, but]{.underline} at the same time
t[he evidence we have just presented suggests that it imposes a risk on
agricultural productivity, through the loss of biodiversity on natural
and agricultural land]{.underline}.3 The creation of this risk to global
agricultural productivity results from individual decisions.
Profit-maximizing farmers clear land and plant it with small numbers of
high-yielding crop varieties, leading to the loss of biodiversity at the
local and global scales. In this process, farmers only partially take
into account their marginal impact on biodiversity, and in turn on
agricultural productivity (Bowman and Zilberman, 2013, Heal et al.,
2004, Weitzman, 2000). Decisions at the individual level about land
conversion and crop selection thus cause an externality with respect to
aggregate production.

### US -- China Conflict Inevitable

#### Impossible to solve US-China Relations -- 8 reasons

Paul D, \"Can the US-China crisis be stabilized?,\" Jun 26,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/06/26/can-the-u-s-china-crisis-be-stabilized/

This week President Trump will meet with China's leader Xi Jinping at
the G-20 summit meeting in Japan. The media is focusing on whether the
two leaders can restart trade talks or at least call a "trade war"
truce. But far more is at stake. The entire U.S.-China relationship is
now in a dangerous downward spiral. Can the Trump-Xi meeting stabilize
things?

Unfortunately that's unlikely because [the crisis in U.S.-China
relations now exists in virtually every part of the
relationship]{.underline}. [Even more troubling and dangerous, there is
a growing sense in each country's government that the other is a
pervasive adversary]{.underline}. Here are just a few areas of conflict:

Trade war: [The current trade war is having large negative consequences
in both countries]{.underline}---with huge tariffs in place, more
tariffs promised, and collapsed negotiations that have become so
publicly politicized in both countries that a deal will be very
difficult to achieve.

Tech rivalry[: The U.S. and China have escalated their tech rivalry,
each believing that hi-tech will determine who dominates the future
global economy and military power]{.underline}. The Chinese leadership
believes that U.S. actions like placing Huawei on the "Entity List"
(banning it from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S.
government approval) reveals a U.S. goal to gravely wound China's
economy. Many in the U.S. government favor "decoupling" our two
economies to protect us, in spite of radical effects this would have.

Taiwan escalations: [Taiwan, the single most sensitive and militarily
dangerous issue in the U.S.-China relationship for more than 50 years,
is newly fraught on both sides]{.underline}. In a striking departure
from the "One China" principle, a Department of Defense report recently
referred to Taiwan in a category of "countries." Senior Chinese
officials, meanwhile, have spoken in seemingly stronger tones about
"reuniting" the mainland and Taiwan, "reserving the option of taking all
necessary measures."

Asia-Pacific militarization: [China's growing military power---and its
occupation, reclamation and militarization of various South China Sea
land features]{.underline} (in violation of international law as
determined by a UN arbitration tribunal)---[have produced intensified
U.S. patrols and freedom of navigation operations, creating real risks
of military conflict, with weakened crisis management procedures making
escalations from accidents and individual incidents much more
likely.]{.underline}

Ideological clashes: [Open ideological shouting matches have
increased.]{.underline} On the U.S. side, Acting Secretary of Defense
Shanahan recently described the U.S.-China relationship as a
"geopolitical rivalry between free and repressive world order visions,"
and a senior State Department official recently called it a "clash of
civilizations." China's authoritarian leaders have not only more bluntly
criticized the inequalities and disarray of U.S. democracy and U.S.
"bullying," but domestically have more firmly imposed CCP political
control, slowed down liberalizing economic reforms, and more branzenly
committed human rights abuses, most disturbingly with the massive
detentions in Xinjiang to "re-educate" the Uighur population.

Visa wars: [Each country is undermining the stabilizing power of
people-to-people exchanges by denying visas to people from the other
country]{.underline}. One rationale on the U.S. side was stated by FBI
Director Christopher Wray, who calls China's espionage and influence
activity a "whole of society" effort, making every potential Chinese
visitor a person of suspicion. China's intimidation of foreigners,
including its shocking ongoing detention of several Canadian travelers,
is on the increase.

International system conflict: In different ways, both China under [Xi
and]{.underline} the U.S. under T[rump are challenging the international
system that has generally provided remarkable global
stabilit]{.underline}y over the last 70 years, and challenging each
other's role in the system. The system is rapidly weakening, with no
significant efforts underway to adjust and strengthen it.

https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/06/26/can-the-u-s-china-crisis-be-stabilized/

As important as any of the above, [U.S. and China cooperation is
urgently necessary to address problems that do pose existential threats
to]{.underline} both countries and [the entire planet. We need to
cooperate with China if we are to have any chance of effectively
addressing climate change, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and
pandemic diseases,]{.underline} to give three particularly salient
examples. (The Trump administration has rejected both the Paris climate
accords and the Iran nuclear deal, each partly a product of U.S.-China
cooperation, so it does not treat these achievements of cooperation as
actual benefits to U.S. interests and a strong reason we should manage
our differences with China in a way that preserves such cooperation.)
China and the U.S. will have many differences and will compete in many
dimensions. But along with tension and competition and even rivalry, we
need to cooperate. [And to have that necessary cooperation we must
effectively manage our competition.]{.underline}

But [there is a possibility that brewing transatlantic and transpacific

aluminum and steel]{.underline}---[key raw materials imported by A&D
