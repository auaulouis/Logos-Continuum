### The Plan:

#### The United States federal government should end Foreign Military Sales of lethal weaponry to the Ukraine

### First is the RUSSIA Advantage

#### The current crisis in the Ukraine is escalating, but Russia's defensive realist posture ensures that it'll avoid conflict for now.

\"Threat or Threatened? Russian Foreign Policy in the Era of NATO
Expansion,\" Australian Institute of International Affairs,
https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/)

Vladimir Putin's portrayal in the Western media often resembles that of
a comic book villain. [The Russian President tends to be characterised
as a threatening Machiavellian tactician who, driven by extreme
nationalist fervour, is seeking to restore Russia's status as an empire
and a great power.]{.underline} Writing in The Guardian, Anthony Julius
claims, "the threat of Russian imperialism is real, and the armoury at
Putin's disposal formidable... Putin is a master tactician -- able to
deploy the right weapon at the right
time."[\[1\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn1)
The Sydney Morning Herald's Peter Hartcher adopts a similar tone stating
that "he wants conquest... If Putin ever seems to offer a concession,
it's either a tactic or a
ruse."[\[2\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn2)
The basis for Putin's notoriety hardly needs to be restated here -- of
chief importance is his decision to annex the Crimean Peninsular in
February 2014 and his subsequent orchestration of a war by proxy in
Eastern Ukraine. Not only are these events commonly taken as evidence
that Putin has territorial ambitions, but some have argued that they're
merely the prelude to the Russian President's imperialist grand
strategy. The Economistissued us with a dire warning: "Nearly a
quarter-century after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West faces a
greater threat from the East than at any point during the cold
war."[\[3\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn3)
David Blair's unsubtle comparison of Putin with Hitler in The British
Daily Telegraph reflects the extent to which the popular narrative has
framed the Russian President as a formidable and calculating threat.
Blair writes that the crisis in Ukraine "was never about Ukraine
alone..."[\[4\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn4)
[Vladimir Putin is a brutal autocrat and the Kremlin's actions in
Ukraine undoubtedly constitute a gross violation of international law.
However]{.underline}, [the popular characterisation of Putin's grand
strategy as imperialist is erroneous.]{.underline} [Russia's primary
foreign policy objective regarding the Ukraine has been to prevent the
country joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}
(NATO), [the world's most formidable military alliance, which Russia
justifiably regards as dire threat to its security. In a Foreign Affairs
article]{.underline} entitled, "Why the Ukraine Crisis is the West's
Fault", [John Mearsheimer explains that "\[Russian leaders\] would not
stand by while their strategically important neighbour turned into a
Western
bastion."]{.underline}[\[5\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn5)[Within
the Australian media, Tom Switzer has been a rare voice of thoughtful
moderation on Russia, observing that Putin has been, "protecting
legitimate security interests", and that his, "objectives are
limited]{.underline}."[\[6\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn6)
It is vitally important that the West understands that [Russia's conduct
in the Ukraine is a rational response to the strategic pressure that has
been placed on the country by an encroaching military alliance, NATO.
The Kremlin's foreign policies conform to the expectations of defensive
realism. A defensive realist foreign policy prioritises state security,
which is maximised when a stable balance of power is established in the
international
system]{.underline}.[\[7\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn7)
[Defensive realists advise against imperialism and aggression, but they
do advocate power projection by threatened states to the extent that is
necessary to restore the international system to a stable state of
equilibrium]{.underline}.[\[8\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn8)
As Robert Person argues, [Putin has been pursuing a defensive realist
strategy because his, "ultimate objective is to maximize his security,
not his
power.]{.underline}"[\[9\]](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/threat-or-threatened-russian-foreign-policy-in-the-era-of-nato-expansion/#_ftn9)
[NATO's hubristic expansion has destroyed the balance of power that
existed in Europe during the Cold War and engendered feelings of
insecurity and vulnerability in the minds of Russia's leaders. These
attitudes are rooted in a rational conception of the international as a
realm in which the threat of war is constant and each state must take
responsibility for its own survival.]{.underline} To say this is not to
condone the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine on an ethical level. But [the
righteous condemnations of Russia in the Western media have only served
to obscure the origins of the Ukraine crisis and potential strategies
for mediating it. If peace and stability are to be re-established in
Eastern Europe, then it is vital that we look past the scaremongering
and hyperbole, and re-examine the origins of Russia-NATO
antagonism.]{.underline}

#### Any appearance to the contrary is simply a political tactic -- Russia wants to weaken the Ukraine, but it's not seeking a war.

Two of the Ukrainian vessels seized by Russia on Sunday pictured near
Kerch, Crimea on Nov. 26. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) [Russia's violent
escalation of tensions with Ukraine over access to waters near the
Crimean peninsula is potentially the most serious challenge to Kiev and
the West---especially to Washington---since Russia annexed Crimea more
than four years ago. The maritime showdown could spark political
uncertainty in Ukraine]{.underline}, which on Monday voted to
impose [martial
law](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kerch-strait.html) for
30 days to deal with the crisis. [Russia's aggressive behavior also sent
the European Union, United Nations, and NATO scrambling for a response,
raising the prospect of a beefed-up Western naval presence in the Black
Sea and additional economic sanctions on Russia.]{.underline} On Sunday,
in what is thought to be the first time the Russian military has
admitted directly opening fire on its Ukrainian counterparts in four
years of war, Russian ships rammed and fired on a convoy headed into the
Sea of Azov, the small body of water between the Crimean peninsula and
southern Ukraine. Six Ukrainian sailors were wounded, and Russia
detained two gunboats and a tugboat. It was the sharpest escalation
since Moscow this spring began harassing and detaining hundreds of
Ukrainian ships transiting the chokepoint of the Kerch Strait, which
Russia controls thanks to the completion of Europe's[longest
bridge](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/putin-opens-bridge-between-crimea-and-russian-mainland) in
May. Ukraine's Foreign
Ministry [denounced](https://www.unian.info/politics/10351257-ukraine-s-foreign-ministry-provocations-of-russia-in-black-and-azov-seas-cross-the-red-line.html) what
it called Russia's provocations, saying that Moscow had "crossed the red
line" by interfering with free navigation. Moscow, for its part, accused
Kiev of [provoking](http://tass.com/kerch-strait-provocation) the
incident to enable fresh Western sanctions on Russia. "I think this
could be an inflection point, where things get much more violent"
between Russia and Ukraine, said Jeffrey Edmonds, a research scientist
at CNA and former Russia director on the National Security Council.
While Canada, the United Kingdom, and a chorus of other European
countries condemned Russia's action, the U.S. response was muted until
U.N. Ambassador Nikki
Haley [railed](https://usun.state.gov/highlights/8785) against Russia at
an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday. "It is an arrogant
act that the international community must condemn and will never
accept," she said. But top Democratic lawmakers were irked that U.S.
President Donald Trump had not issued any statement on it by Monday. "At
this precarious time, the U.S. cannot afford a weak performance by
President Trump at the G20, like we saw in Helsinki. Mr. President, this
is your opportunity to finally show American leadership in defense of
our principles and our close allies across Europe," said Sen. Bob
Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, in
a [statement](https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-condemns-russias-seizing-of-ukrainian-ships-near-crimea-calls-on-pres-trump-to-increase-security-assistance-in-the-region) on
Monday. Menendez referred to Trump's meeting with Russian President
Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland in July, in which Trump sided with
Putin over U.S. intelligence assessments on election
meddling, [infuriating](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/25/in-fiery-hearing-pompeo-trades-barbs-with-lawmakers-trump-putin-helsinki-summit-north-korea-corker-menendez-senate-foreign-relations-committee) many
members of Congress and national security professionals. Late Monday,
the State Department released a statement expressing its "deep concern"
over the incident, and calling on Russia to return the seized vessels
and crewmen and respect Ukraine's access to territorial waters. The
statement, in the name of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also called on
"both parties to exercise restraint and abide by their international
obligations and commitments." "It's important for the West to send a
very sharp message to Russia that if you don't stop this, there will be
consequences," said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine
now at the Brookings Institution. "It's a test of the West, and
Washington should have responded" immediately after the incident, he
said. [Russia's objectives in blocking access to the Sea of Azov are
several, and are part of Moscow's deliberate efforts to consolidate its
hold over Crimea and ring-fence much of the Black Sea, a Russian
strategic obsession since the late 17th century. By interdicting ships
headed for Ukrainian ports such as Mariupol and Berdyansk]{.underline}
(where Ukraine just started building a naval base), [Russia has cost
Ukraine millions of dollars in economic losses. Further weakening
southern Ukraine fits Moscow's longer-term goal of destabilizing its
smaller neighbor, especially ahead of Ukraine's presidential election
due in March.]{.underline} "There's a political message about the
economic vulnerability of those ports on the Sea of Azov" that serve as
important export terminals for Ukraine, Pifer said. "[It's designed to
signal to Ukraine that you're still vulnerable and there's not much you
can do about it."]{.underline} Longer term, some see Russia angling to
control a land corridor between Russia and the annexed Crimean
peninsula, possibly even extending control as far west as Transnistria,
the breakaway region of Moldova. "If the West's reaction is too weak,
the idea is to cut off Ukraine from the Black Sea and leave it a rump
state," said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.
Russia may also be seeking to provoke Ukraine into a military response;
given the overwhelming disparity between Ukraine's paltry forces and
Russia's numerous naval forces in and around the Sea of Azov, it would
be a way to deal Kiev a crushing blow if Ukraine takes the
bait. **"**It's clear the Ukrainian side is outflanked and outgunned by
the Russian side," said Alina Polyakova, an expert on Russia and Ukraine
at the Brookings Institution. At any rate, Russia has already roiled
Ukrainian politics just months ahead of an election in which the
unpopular President Petro Poroshenko
is [trailing](https://www.inquisitr.com/5178983/ukraine-martial-law-cancel-elections) in
the polls. On Monday, the Ukrainian parliament approved Poroshenko's
request for a 30-day martial law to deal with the increased threat from
Russia, and Poroshenko said that next year's presidential election would
continue as planned. On Monday, the European Union, NATO, and the United
Nations all convened separate meetings to consider how to respond to
Russia's latest move. NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg [condemned](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_160789.htm) Russia,
saying its militarization of Crimea and the Sea of Azov "poses further
threats to Ukraine's independence" and called on Russia to release the
Ukrainian sailors and ships it seized on Sunday, while European Council
President Donald
Tusk [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-tusk/eus-tusk-europe-will-stay-united-in-support-of-ukraine-idUSKCN1NV1D9) that
"Europe will stand united in support of Ukraine." Some analysts urged
caution. Mark Galeotti, a senior non-resident fellow at Prague's
Institute of International Relations, said that neither Moscow or Kiev
would look to significantly escalate the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
"Kiev can't really can't escalate it, [Moscow doesn't want to escalate
it.]{.underline} That doesn't mean that a bad decision on either side
can't escalate it, but that's not the intent."

#### However, US arm sales of lethal weaponry to the is escalating the conflict and will lead the US into a conflict with Russia---ensuring war.

Quietly Increases Lethal Weapons to Ukraine"

NIJ

For all of the loose (frequently hysterical) talk in Congress, the
foreign policy community, and the news media about President Donald
Trump's alleged eagerness to appease Vladimir Putin, [U.S. policy
remains as confrontational as ever toward Russia.]{.underline} Among
other actions, the Trump administration has involved U.S. forces in NATO
military exercises (war games) in Poland and other East European
countries on Russia's border, as well as in naval maneuvers in the Black
Sea near Russia's sensitive naval base at Sevastopol. Washington has
even sent U.S. troops as participants in joint military exercises with
Ukrainian forces---an act that Moscow considers especially provocative,
given its tense relations with Kiev. **[On no issue is the
administration's risky course more evident than its military policy
toward Ukraine. Recent measures are certain to provoke Moscow further,
and entangle the United States to an unwise extent with an extremely
murky, ideologically troubling Ukrainian regime.]{.underline}**
Secretary of Defense James Mattis acknowledges that U.S. instructors are
training Ukrainian military units at a base in western Ukraine.
Washington also has approved two important arms sales to Kiev's ground
forces in just the past nine months. The first transaction in December
2017 was limited to small arms that at least could be portrayed as
purely defensive weapons. That agreement included the export of Model
M107A1 Sniper Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories,
a sale valued at \$41.5 million. [A transaction in April 2018 was more
serious. **Not only was it larger (\$47 million), it included far more
lethal weaponry, particularly 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles---the kind
of weapons that Barack Obama's administration had declined to give
Kiev.**]{.underline} Needless to say, [the Kremlin was not pleased about
either sale.]{.underline} Moreover, Congress soon passed legislation in
May that authorized \$250 million in military assistance, including
lethal weaponry, to Ukraine in 2019. Congress had twice voted for
military support on a similar scale during the last years of Obama's
administration, but the White House blocked implementation. The Trump
administration cleared that obstacle out of the way in December 2017 at
the same time that it approved the initial small-weapons sale. The
passage of the May 2018 legislation means that the path is now open for
a dramatic escalation of U.S. military backing for Kiev. On September 1,
former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker disclosed during an interview
with The Guardian that Washington's future military aid to Kiev would
likely involve weapons sales to Ukraine's air force and navy as well as
the army. "The Javelins are mainly symbolic and it's not clear if they
would ever be used," Aric Toler, a research scholar at the Atlantic
Council, asserted. One could well dispute his sanguine conclusion, but
even Toler conceded: "Support for the Ukrainian navy and air defence
would be a big deal. That would be far more significant." [Volker's
cavalier attitude about U.S. arms sales to a government locked in a
crisis with Russia epitomizes the arrogance and tone-deaf nature of the
views that too many U.S. foreign policy officials exhibit regarding the
sensitive Ukraine issue.]{.underline} "We can have a conversation with
Ukraine like we would with any other country about what do they need. I
think that there's going to be some discussion about naval capability
because as you know their navy was basically taken by Russia \[when the
Soviet Union dissolved\]. And so they need to rebuild a navy and they
have very limited air capability as well. I think we'll have to look at
air defence." [One suspects that Americans would be incensed at
comparable actions by Moscow if the geo-strategic situations were
reversed. Imagine if Russia (even a democratic Russia) had emerged from
the wreckage of the Cold War as the undisputed global superpower, and a
weakened United States had to watch as the Kremlin expanded a powerful,
Russian-led military alliance to America's borders, conducted alliance
war games within sight of U.S. territory, interfered in Canada's
internal political affairs to oust a democratically elected pro-American
government, and then pursued growing military ties with the new,
anti-U.S. government in Ottawa. Yet that would be disturbingly similar
to what Washington has done regarding NATO policy and U.S. relations
with Ukraine. Moreover, although Kiev's cheerleaders in the Western
(especially U.S.) media like to portray Ukraine as a beleaguered
democracy that plays the role of David to Russia's evil Goliath, the
reality is far murkier.]{.underline} Putin's government overstates
matters when it alleges that Ukraine's 2014 Maidan revolution was a
U.S.-orchestrated coup that brought outright fascists to power in Kiev.
Nevertheless, that version contains more than a little truth. Prominent,
powerful U.S. figures, most notably the late Senator John McCain and
Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria
Nuland, openly sided with demonstrators seeking to unseat Ukraine's
elected government. Indeed, Nuland was caught on tape with U.S.
Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt scheming about the desired
composition of a new government in Kiev. It is unfair to portray
Ukraine's current administration led by President Petro Poroshenko as a
neo-fascist regime. Post-revolution elections appear to have been
reasonably free and fair, and there are major factions that are
committed to genuine democratic values. But Ukraine also is hardly a
model of Western-style democracy. Not only is it afflicted with
extensive graft and corruption, but some extreme nationalist and even
neo-Nazi groups play a significant role in the "new" Ukraine. The
notoriously fascist Azov Battalion, for example, continues to occupy a
prominent position in Kiev's efforts to defeat separatists in Ukraine's
eastern Donbass region. Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the
self-declared Donetsk People's Republic in the pro-Russia rebel-occupied
city of Donetsk, was assassinated on September 1 and officials there and
in Russia are blaming Kiev. The Ukrainian government has denied
involvement. Other ultranationalist factions act as domestic militias
that attempt to intimidate more moderate Ukrainians. Even the Poroshenko
government itself has adopted troubling censorship measures and other
autocratic policies. Officials in both the Obama and Trump
administration have taken a much too casual attitude toward U.S.
cooperation with extremist elements and a deeply flawed Ukrainian
government. [Both the danger of stoking tensions with Moscow and
becoming too close to a regime in Kiev that exhibits disturbing features
should caution the Trump administration against boosting military aid to
Ukraine.]{.underline} It is an unwise policy on strategic as well as
moral grounds. [Trump administration officials should refuse to be
intimidated or stampeded into forging a risky and unsavory alliance with
Kiev out of fear of being portrayed as excessively "soft" toward Russia.
Instead, the president and his advisers need to spurn efforts to
increase U.S. support for Ukraine. **A good place to start would be to
restore the Obama administration's refusal to approve arms sales to
Kiev. Washington must not pour gasoline on a geo-strategic fire that
could lead to a full-blown crisis between the United States and
Russia.**]{.underline}

#### In particular, 2018 Javelin missile sales escalated the crisis to the brink, but upcoming man-portable air-defense systems explode the conflict.

Ukraine? Possibly Surface-To-Air Missiles"
<https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-us-missiles-russia/29994114.html>) NIJ

Over the five years of grinding war that has pitted Ukrainian forces
against Russia-backed fighters, the United States has provided hundreds
of millions of dollars in military gear: night-vision goggles, flak
jackets, vehicles, counter-battery radars, among other things. Last
year, [after years of internal debate that preceded his
administration]{.underline}, President Donald [Trump began supplying
Ukraine with sophisticated anti-tank missiles known as Javelins \-- a
move that some feared would antagonize Moscow.]{.underline} **[Now, U.S.
lawmakers are moving to up the ante again, with legislation that would
authorize supplying Kyiv with surface-to-air missiles. The effort comes
in an amendment being attached to legislation providing funding for the
Defense Department; the amendment removes existing language prohibiting
the sale of such missiles, known as man-portable air-defense systems, or
MANPADS.]{.underline}** Sponsored by the two top lawmakers on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee \-- Democrat Eliot Engel and Republican
Michael McCaul \-- the measure, which is expected to pass easily, does
not mean that the weapons will be supplied right away. Any final
decision would have to go through multiple approval processes at various
U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Defense Department. Moreover, [targets
for Ukrainian surface-to-air missiles are limited for now: Russia-backed
separatists don't have fighter jets, and Russia sending its own aircraft
over Ukraine would undermine its assertions that it is not involved in
the conflict.]{.underline} Still, [the move sends a clear message to the
Kremlin of where Congress stands regarding the war in
Ukraine.]{.underline} And, according to Steven Pifer, a former U.S.
ambassador to Ukraine, [it\'s a logical next step after the U.S.
decision to supply Javelins to the Ukrainian armed forces.]{.underline}
\"I don\'t see this as generating more problems than the arrival of the
Javelins did,\" Pifer, now a research fellow at Stanford University\'s
Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, told RFE/RL.
\"We\'re not talking about providing the Ukrainians with F-35 fighters
or M-1 tanks.\" The Defense Department did not immediately respond to a
query seeking comment on the possibility of supplying the missiles. One
U.S. diplomat who has worked on Ukraine-related issues downplayed the
significance of the amendment, telling RFE/RL on the condition of
anonymity in order to speak freely that it simply removed \"an arbitrary
restriction that is not in place for most countries.\" The move comes as
part of a broader effort in Congress to increase military support for
Ukraine. Two separate pieces of legislation making their way through the
House and the Senate call for authorizing up to \$300 million in annual
military support for Ukraine, an increase from past years. And the House
legislation calls for the first time for supplying anti-ship missiles
and coastal-defense weaponry to Ukraine in response to an incident in
November 2018, when Russian Coast Guard ships seized three Ukrainian
boats and 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait near the Crimean Peninsula.
Though the overall death toll has surpassed 13,000, fighting around
Ukraine\'s Donbas region has ebbed and flowed in intensity since 2014,
when the conflict with Russia first erupted. In recent weeks, there\'s
been a sharp uptick in artillery shelling and gunfire, with Ukraine\'s
military reporting that at least six soldiers were killed last week.
[It\'s unclear how Russia would respond if Washington did in fact move
forward to supply the surface-to-air missiles. And it\'s unclear how
that would affect stalled peace negotiations, including the so-called
Minsk Trilateral Contact Group meetings and the Normandy Format talks.
Ukraine\'s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for
restarting both efforts; last week, the Trilateral Group \-- comprised
of officials from Russia, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe \-- met for the first time in weeks.]{.underline}
But [Konstantin Kosachyov, a member of Russia\'s upper house of
parliament and a Kremlin ally, criticized the overall increase in U.S.
military funding for Ukraine. \"In this way Washington fuels Ukraine\'s
internal conflict. Such foreign support may create a dangerous delusion
in Kiev that a solution can be achieved by military
means,\"]{.underline} Kosachyov said in a post to his Facebook page on
June 11. [\"Each million dollars of military support to Kiev spells more
casualties and months and even years of war against one's own people,
for which the United States will bear its share of
responsibility.\"]{.underline} The MANPADS would have no immediate
battlefield use, Pifer noted, since Russian military aircraft have not
been used in the conflict. Drones, however, are widely used by both
sides in the conflict. While [Moscow reacted angrily when Washington
agreed to supply the Javelins to Ukraine]{.underline}, there have been
few remarks by Russian officials on the subject since the 210 missiles
and 37 launchers arrived in April 2018. Ukraine has showcased the
Javelins in publicized drills but its armed forces have not used them in
combat against Russia-backed forces in eastern battlefields. The special
U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, has said that the Javelins are
being stored in a secure facility far from the front line. Ukrainian and
U.S. sources with knowledge of the storage locations have told RFE/RL
that the missiles and launchers have been separated into smaller groups
and are held in strategic locations around the country, possibly in
underground bunkers, where they can be moved quickly to areas that
border Russia or the eastern front line. In March, [the top U.S.
military commander for Europe told the Senate Armed Services Committee
that even if the Javelins hadn\'t been deployed, their presence had been
registered by Russia-backed forces.]{.underline} \"They take that into
consideration in the deployment of their forces and where they put
them,\" General Curtis Scaparrotti told the committee. Since 2014,
Ukraine has received more than \$3 billion in total support, including
security and nonsecurity assistance, from the United States.

It is 9am on a chilly March morning. Delegates from across the world
have assembled for an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Council,
NATO's main decision-making body. The main item on the agenda: an update
from the Supreme Allied Commander Europe on Russian escalations in
Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, to determine NATO's response. No one
doubts the gravity of the situation. Russian forces are moving west to
occupy parts of Ukraine beyond the Donbas region and the Crimea. There
have also been severe Russian cyber attacks on German infrastructure,
while Vladimir Putin has threatened to invade Estonia. NATO's secretary
general has asked one of his predecessors, Lord Robertson of Port Ellen,
to join the meeting and share advice. Do not adjust your set: this
meeting took place, but it was [a simulation -- set in a very near
future]{.underline} in which the Ukraine has joined NATO and the UK has
left the EU. [These kinds of exercise are conducted regularly by NATO
and national armies to anticipate what might happen in the "[fog of
war](https://clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/TOC.htm)]{.underline}".
Standing in for the NATO headquarters in Brussels on this occasion was
the University of Stirling in central Scotland. The delegates were
students on the university's masters programme in international conflict
and cooperation, and the doctorate in diplomacy. Lord Robertson was the
only person playing himself. He briefed delegates under Chatham House
rules on his time chairing NATO, including the historic decision on
September 12, 2001 to [invoke collective defensive action under [Article
5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm) of the founding
treaty.]{.underline} Immersed in NATO's engine room, our delegates had
to strike a balance during two days of negotiations between countries
advocating conflict resolution and those inclined to deterrence -- if
not pre-emptive action. As well as informing the students' learning, it
produced the following insights for the real world. 1. Russian
capabilities Delegates had to assess Russian defensive capabilities
using real-life data. They concluded that while Russia looks strong on a
country-by-country comparison, its armed forces
[remain](https://www.dw.com/en/the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-russias-military/a-43293017)
stretched and are sometimes poorly equipped. Russia would probably not
be able to sustain a war with NATO troops over several months, and would
likely be challenged by fighting on two fronts. Having said that, the
country's forces have
[recently](https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/05/03/assessing-russia-s-reorganized-and-rearmed-military-pub-69853)
modernised, making them more effective than a few years ago[. Russia is
also closer than most NATO powers to Ukraine and the Baltics, so could
mobilise more quickly and potentially gain [strategic
advantages](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2400/RR2402/RAND_RR2402.pdf).]{.underline}
NATO action in Ukraine would be complicated by a low bridge that Russia
has
[opened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/putin-opens-bridge-between-crimea-and-russian-mainland)connecting
Crimea to the Russian mainland. This makes it difficult for larger ships
to move between Ukraine's Black Sea ports and the Mediterranean. Russian
expertise in cyber attacks and creating confusion by spreading fake news
could also create disunity among NATO members. Takeaway: the Russian
bear is frail but can still bite. 2. Expect complexity Countries in our
simulation negotiated according to national interests. The multilateral
negotiation splintered into smaller discussions as mini-alliances
emerged. For example, Turkey -- with its [improving
relations](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/turkey-and-russia-new-alignment)
with Russia and exposure to potential refugees -- was so conciliatory to
Moscow that its NATO membership became questionable. On the other side
of the spectrum, Ukraine and also [Romania, which [feels
threatened](https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/dealing-with-the-russian-lake-next-door-romania-and-black-sea-security/)
by Russian aggression in the Black Sea region, sought immediate
offensive action.]{.underline} Alliances like these weren't always
visible to the outside world. They complicated negotiations, especially
when such countries had essentially non-negotiable aims. Takeaway:
things are not always what they seem, even within a negotiation. Try and
stay flexible, and don't rely on media reports about counterparts'
interests. 3. Events, events, events Just like in real life, our
delegates had to keep monitoring an internal news feed. In one
announcement, [Russia began mobilising after hard-line statements from
certain NATO members leaked to the media on day one of the
negotiation]{.underline}. Several times, discussions had to start from
scratch as delegations changed priorities and strategies. Takeaway:
constantly ask yourself how events affect your own position and those of
your counterparts. 4. Clarity under pressure **[With full military
intervention and occupation of Ukraine by Russia on the cards by the
middle of day two, NATO allies had to deploy ground troops or risk
ceding ground to Moscow]{.underline}**. Issues agonised over the day
before became less relevant as delegations were forced to compromise in
the interests of collective action. Takeaway: time pressure can make
decision-making hot-headed, but can lead to clarity of purpose.
Negotiators who understand this can use it to their advantage. 5. EU
security As EU members of our fictional North Atlantic Council discussed
issues among themselves, we witnessed how the EU has become a
geopolitical actor with ["state-like"
qualities](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/uk-realising-eu-is-dominant-power-in-europe-and-brexit-will-be-on-its-terms-1.3818132).
Before committing to security actions through NATO, EU members
negotiated with each other and sought a coherent position One important
dimension in the real world is the EU's Russia sanctions, which are
[slightly
different](https://www.iflr.com/Article/3815405/PRIMER-US-and-EU-sanctions-against-Russia.html?ArticleId=3815405)
to US sanctions. With Ukraine now also party to an [EU Association
Agreement](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-signs-landmark-eu-deal/),
the EU is demonstrating its capability to project power abroad.
Takeaway: the EU is developing its own geopolitical and security role in
Europe, with potential consequences for NATO. 6. The UK squeeze Within
NATO, the UK has generally mediated between the US and usually softer EU
positions. Our simulation showed that after Brexit, despite its
important role as a nuclear-armed NATO member, the UK will likely feel
squeezed between the US and EU. Takeaway: the implications of Brexit for
the UK in NATO deserve more attention. 7. Refugee risks In our
simulation NATO members closer to Russia, such as Poland and Hungary,
were particularly worried that military action in Ukraine would lead to
a large number of refugees -- with potentially serious domestic
political consequences. Takeaway: we don't
[always](https://www.securityconference.de/en/human-security/) take
enough account of the linkages between military and human security. 8.
Take positive decisions When the BBC
[war-gamed](https://www.strategiaworldwide.com/bbc2s-world-war-three-inside-the-war-room/)
a similar scenario several years ago, [the US got drawn into a **nuclear
war**]{.underline}. Our fictional delegates managed to avoid such awful
outcomes by using what deterrent power they had. They combined
mobilisation with the offer of talks in such a way that Russia backed
off. Despite some hawkish pressure, the situation was mostly defused by
dominant countries such as the US as well as conciliatory EU voices.
Takeaway: On March 18, on the fifth anniversary of annexation, NATO
[reiterated](https://www.unian.info/politics/10483398-nato-calls-on-russia-to-return-control-of-crimea-to-ukraine.html)
its view that Crimea is Ukrainian territory. Meanwhile, hostilities
[continue](https://www.unian.info/war/10482615-russia-led-forces-mount-six-attacks-on-ukrainian-positions-in-donbas-on-sunday.html)
in Donbas. The apparent
[stalemate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/19/five-years-have-passed-russia-is-still-occupying-territory-ukraine/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b50055115aa8)
in Ukraine could change overnight -- not least with the [presidential
election](https://theconversation.com/ukraine-presidential-election-young-comedian-leads-polls-but-countrys-dangerous-divisions-are-no-joke-113397)
at the end of March. If so, [NATO members will have to make a choice,
despite the fact that Ukraine is not currently a member of the
alliance]{.underline}. As became clear to our participants, the one
thing you can't do in a moment of international crisis is to refuse to
act if your interests are at stake.

#### Russian hybrid tactics in particular ensures the conflict escalates to nuclear war.

[Three developments suggest a willingness by Russia to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in response to non-nuclear attacks [in a manner
that lowers the threshold of nuclear war]{.underline}. [First, the
concept of preventative de-escalation is important]{.underline}. A
recent IISS analysis explained de-escalation in which limited nuclear
war could be used to:¶ '...de-escalate and terminate combat actions on
terms acceptable to Russia through the threat of inflicting unacceptable
damage upon the enemy. Such limited nuclear use may deter both nuclear
and conventional aggression.'¶ [Second, the integration of conventional
pre-nuclear and nuclear forces reinforces Russia's coercive power
against NATO in the pre-war 'Phase Zero' in a future regional
crisis]{.underline}---for example, [in the **Baltics**]{.underline}. And
[third, the Russians are clearly conscious of that coercive power given
their recent nuclear signaling that suggests Russia continues to see
such weapons as a means of national strength]{.underline}. [Russia has
undertaken **sabre rattling** through **simulated nuclear strikes** in
large-scale exercises and **aggressive probing** of NATO airspace with
nuclear-capable bombers]{.underline}. It has demonstrated the dual-role
Kalibr NK sea-launched cruise missile in deadly strikes against Syria,
and deployed dual-role Iskander short-range ballistic missiles into
Kaliningrad in a manner that was highly threatening to NATO. [That has
been backed by public statements which reinforce Russia's nuclear
weapons capability and even explicit nuclear threats to NATO
states]{.underline}, notably Denmark.¶ [Russian nuclear forces are being
**swiftly upgraded** with the focus on ICBM modernisation]{.underline},
based on introducing the SS-27 'Yars' road-mobile missile, and from 2018
the silo-based RS-28 'Sarmat' heavy ICBM. Yars and Sarmat replace much
of Russia's aging Soviet strategic rocket forces with significantly more
capable delivery systems. Russia's Navy is transitioning to modern
Sineva and Bulava sea-launched ballistic missiles, on the modern Borei
class SSBNs, [while the Russian Air Force is restarting the Tu-160
Blackjack production line to produce the updated Tu-160M2
bomber]{.underline} that eventually will be complemented by the 'PAK-DA'
advanced bomber sometime in the 2020s.¶ The strategic nuclear force
modernisation is important but it's [the **integration** of Russia's
conventional **pre-nuclear forces** with its large **'non-strategic
nuclear forces'** that's of greatest significance]{.underline}. [That's
shaping Russian thinking on the use of nuclear weapons, particularly
during **Hybrid Warfare**, in a way that makes the **risk of a crisis**
with Russia much more **dangerous**]{.underline}. [Russia is
increasingly focusing on the use of its nuclear forces to enhance its
ability to **undertake military adventurism** at the **conventional
level** in a manner that's **highly threatening** to NATO]{.underline}.
[However the reliance on nuclear signaling, the changing operational
posture of dual-role forces and concepts like 'preventative
de-escalation', increases the **risk of miscalc**ulation in a crisis
that could lead to an **escalation** through the **nuclear
threshold**]{.underline}.

Now 10 years ago, several of the world's leading climatologists and
physicists chose to reinvestigate the long-term environmental impacts of
nuclear war. [The **peer-reviewed studies** they produced are considered
to be the most authoritative type of scientific research, which is
subjected to criticism by the international scientific community before
final publication in scholarly journals]{.underline}. [No serious errors
were found in these studies and their findings **remain
unchallenged**]{.underline}. Alan Robock et al., "Nuclear winter

Michael Mills et al., "Multidecadal global cooling and unprecedented
ozone loss following a regional nuclear conflict," Earth's Future 2.
Alan Robock et al., "Climatic consequences of regional nuclear
conflicts," Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics 7 (2007). Working at the
Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of
Colorado-Boulder, the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers,
and the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, [these
scientists used **state-of-the-art computer modeling** to evaluate the
consequences of a range of possible nuclear conflicts]{.underline}. They
began with a hypothetical war in Southeast Asia, in which a total of 100
Hiroshima-size atomic bombs were detonated in the cities of India and
Pakistan. Please consider the following images of Hiroshima, before and
after the detonation of the atomic bomb, which had an explosive power of
15,000 tons of TNT. The detonation of an atomic bomb with this explosive
power will instantly ignite fires over a surface area of three to five
square miles. In the recent studies, the scientists calculated that the
blast, fire, and radiation from a war fought with 100 atomic bombs could
produce direct fatalities comparable to all of those worldwide in World
War II, or to those once estimated for a "counterforce" nuclear war
between the superpowers. However, the long-term environmental effects of
the war could significantly disrupt the global weather for at least a
decade, which would likely result in a vast global famine. The
scientists predicted that nuclear firestorms in the burning cities would
cause at least five million tons of black carbon smoke to quickly rise
above cloud level into the stratosphere, where it could not be rained
out. The smoke would circle the Earth in less than two weeks and would
form a global stratospheric smoke layer that would remain for more than
a decade. The smoke would absorb warming sunlight, which would heat the
smoke to temperatures near the boiling point of water, producing ozone
losses of 20 to 50 percent over populated areas. This would almost
double the amount of UV-B reaching the most populated regions of the
mid-latitudes, and it would create UV-B indices unprecedented in human
history. In North America and Central Europe, the time required to get a
painful sunburn at mid-day in June could decrease to as little as six
minutes for fair-skinned individuals. As the smoke layer blocked warming
sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface, it would produce the coldest
average surface temperatures in the last 1,000 years. The scientists
calculated that global food production would decrease by 20 to 40
percent during a five-year period following such a war. Medical experts
have predicted that the shortening of growing seasons and corresponding
decreases in agricultural production could cause up to two billion
people to perish from famine. The climatologists also investigated the
effects of a nuclear war fought with the vastly more powerful modern
thermonuclear weapons possessed by the United States, Russia, China,
France, and England. Some of the thermonuclear weapons constructed
during the 1950s and 1960s were 1,000 times more powerful than an atomic
bomb. During the last 30 years, the average size of thermonuclear or
"strategic" nuclear weapons has decreased. Yet today, [each of the
approximately 3,540 strategic weapons deployed by the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia is seven to 80
times more powerful than the atomic bombs modeled in the India-Pakistan
study]{.underline}. The smallest strategic nuclear weapon has an
explosive power of 100,000 tons of TNT, compared to an atomic bomb with
an average explosive power of 15,000 tons of TNT. [Strategic nuclear
weapons produce much larger nuclear firestorms than do atomic
bombs]{.underline}. For example, [a standard Russian 800-kiloton
warhead]{.underline}, on an average day, [will ignite fires covering a
surface area of 90 to 152 square miles]{.underline}. [A war fought with
hundreds]{.underline} or thousands [of **U.S. and Russian** strategic
nuclear weapons would ignite immense nuclear firestorms covering land
surface areas of many thousands or tens of thousands of square
miles]{.underline}. The scientists calculated that [these fires would
produce up to 180 million tons of black carbon soot and smoke, which
would form a dense, global stratospheric smoke layer]{.underline}. [The
smoke would remain in the stratosphere for 10 to **20 years**, and it
would block]{.underline} as much as [70 percent of sunlight]{.underline}
from reaching the surface of the Northern Hemisphere and 35 percent from
the Southern Hemisphere. So much sunlight would be blocked by the smoke
that the noonday sun would resemble a full moon at midnight. [Under such
conditions, it would only require a **matter of days** or weeks for
daily minimum temperatures to fall below freezing in the largest
agricultural areas of the Northern Hemisphere]{.underline}, where
freezing temperatures would occur every day for a period of between one
to more than two years. [Average surface temperatures would \[to\]
become colder than those experienced 18,000 years ago at the height of
the last Ice Age, and the prolonged cold would cause average rainfall to
decrease by up to 90%]{.underline}. [Growing seasons would be completely
eliminated for more than a decade; it would be too cold and dark to grow
food crops, which would **doom the majority of the human
population**]{.underline}.

#### Impact defense is irrelevant. Even with recent reductions in arsenal size, extinction would be inevitable.

#### Perceived differences in military capabilities cause Russia to utilize a Dead Hand system, which means even perception of escalations is enough to trigger the impact.

[Cold War concerns about the survivability of Russian leadership and
their nuclear command and control systems in the event of a U.S. first
strike purportedly led to the development, in the 1980s, of "dead hand"
mechanisms and procedures, also known as Perimeter]{.underline}. [These
allow for a Russian nuclear response to an attack without the need for
real-time launch commands from Russian national leadership]{.underline}
(Blair, 1995, pp. 51--56; Yarynich, 2003, pp. 156--166; Podvig, 2004,
pp. 65--66; Thompson, 2009). [The Dead Hand system was intended to
enable a retaliatory response in the event that nuclear weapons had
decapitated Soviet leadership. Western analysts have disagreed about how
far development and implementation efforts on the Dead Hand system
went]{.underline}. Some feel (Blair, 1995, p. 56) that the Dead Hand
procedures were developed but only partially deployed, while others
argue that the procedures were more extensively deployed. It may seem
strange that so little information has been available in the West about
whether Russia ever built or implemented such a system[. Indeed, the
very idea of a secret Dead Hand system calls to mind the absurdly
dangerous "doomsday machine" in the 1964 movie Dr. Strangelove or: How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. As Strangelove himself
points out, such a system will be useless for deterring Western attack
if Western decisionmakers do not know that the system exists. However,
the most important audience for the Dead Hand system's existence may
have been Russian, not Western: Dead Hand systems were intended to give
Russian generals sufficient confidence in Russia's assured-retaliation
capability that they would allow Dead Hand operation as an alternative
to preemptive attack or launch on warning (Blair, 1995, pp. 50--55;
Hoffman, 2009, pp. 151--152; Thompson, 2009).]{.underline} Though
details on the Dead Hand system are few, and accounts differ somewhat,
the general outline is as follows: [A network of special sensors detects
nuclear detonation by measuring light radioactivity, seismic shocks, and
atmospheric overpressure. The system would usually be turned off during
periods of low tension but would be enabled in a crisis. If the system
detected a nuclear detonation (e.g., in the proximity of any of several
redundant nuclear command nodes near Moscow), and if its communication
links to national leadership went dead, the system would interpret this
as evidence of a nuclear attack on Russia. While a human operator in a
hardened underground system facility (potentially a Russian defense
official who had moved into the bunker at the beginning of the crisis)
would make the final decision on whether to launch nuclear weapons at
the United States, the operator would have little information to work
with beyond the system's indications of nuclear detonation detection or
communication-link failure.]{.underline} What Might a Future Russian
Dead Hand Scenario Look Like? [This is a potential Russian Dead Hand
scenario: First, presumably, Russian leaders perceive a crisis with the
United States. The United States has perhaps reinstated European Phased
Adaptive Array (EPAA) Phase 4 interceptor missile defense development,
and disagreements over oil and gas negotiations erupt into a standoff
between Russia and multiple NATO members.]{.underline} Along with
raising nuclear alert levels, Russian leaders secretly institute Dead
Hand procedures, giving a designated official in a bunker near Moscow
the ability to launch nuclear weapons if the bunker loses communications
with headquarters and if nuclear detonations are detected nearby.
Although the bunker is connected to headquarters and to nuclear command
systems via separate sets of multiple communications channels, these
channels suffer unpredictable problems because of the increased usage
load, as well as apparent cyberattacks of increasing tempo. Two days
after the Russian nuclear alert, apocalyptic terrorists detonate a
nuclear weapon near Washington, D.C., followed two minutes later by a
nuclear attack in the Moscow region. [The nuclear blast in Moscow
triggers Dead Hand nuclear detonation sensors nearby and also severs the
communications links between the bunker and headquarters]{.underline}
(as well as conventional radio and television reception links). However,
the blast does not eliminate all of the bunker's nuclear command system
links. The Russian official in the bunker has felt the Moscow blast,
sees on the system that it registers as a nuclear explosion, and sees
that the communication links to headquarters have gone down (but does
not know about the nuclear blast in Washington). The official's system
console says that all necessary indications that Russia is under nuclear
attack have been satisfied, and the official is able to launch Russian
nuclear weapons at the United States in the next hour but must make that
decision without any additional information. How Risk Levels Could Rise
in the Future [Since mid-2014, events involving Russia, Ukraine, NATO,
and the United States suggest a potential increase in the likelihood of
a conventional conflict between Russia and U.S. allies or partners near
Russia. This eventuality would increase the annual probability of a
nuclear conflict]{.underline}, inadvertent or otherwise. 14 [Russian
Crisis Perception Could Be Linked to Perception of U.S. First-Strike
Capability]{.underline} [Current literature suggests a number of
near-term issues that Russian leaders may see as more threatening than
U.S. leaders realize---namely, the possibility that the United States
could carry out a disabling first strike against Russian nuclear
forces.]{.underline} Concerns about U.S. first-strike capability---and
intent---increased in Russia after the 2006 publication of two articles
by the U.S. analysts Keir Lieber and Daryl Press (2006a, 2006b), which
argued that between its missile defenses and its nuclear and
conventional capabilities, the United States could effectively launch a
debilitating first strike against Russia's arsenal (Quinlivan and
Oliker, 2011, p. 22). In addition, Russian [concerns about force
survivability increase the probability that when presented with a
serious-looking early warning system false alarm, Russian leaders would
use a launchon-warning response instead of riding out the apparently
incoming attack]{.underline}. Presumably, there would be a higher
probability that Russian leaders would use a launch-on-warning response
to a false indication of an incoming attack during a crisis period (when
Russia already has heightened expectation of incoming attack) than
during a low-tension, noncrisis period. Some Russian analysts argue that
a launch-on-warning posture would be the best way to ensure the
deterrent value of Russian nuclear forces. Unfortunately, awareness of
early warning system degradation does not necessarily mean that Russian
leaders will move away from a launch-on-warning posture entirely,
especially if they are increasingly concerned about the survivability of
the Russian nuclear deterrent. Instead, early warning system degradation
might just increase the likelihood of misperception, so that "launch on
erroneous warning" becomes more likely (Quinlivan and Oliker, 2011,
pp. 26--27).

#### Deterrence theory is not compatible with human behavior---there is no REAL way to understand decision making on a leader-by-leader basis

[Given the major advances in our understanding of human decision-making
under conditions of risk, why have senior national security policymakers
generally failed to incorporate these findings into their efforts at
crafting deterrence strategies]{.underline}? One explanation offered by
Robert Jervis posits that "the study of human nature, once central to
much of social science, has been put aside as too difficult to study or
lacking relevance to questions of interest."161 Yet while some of the
research may seem counterintuitive, it is not beyond the mental capacity
of well-educated decision-makers to comprehend. Nor can there be any
doubt as to the relevance of these findings for those seeking to
influence the behavior of their rivals. Yet, as Daniel Kahneman points
out, "[Theories can survive for a long time after conclusive evidence
falsifies them, and the rational-agent model certainly survived the
evidence we have seen, and much other evidence as well]{.underline}."162
He has a point. The so-called unitary rational-agent model of
decision-making has been under assault for over half a century, yet as
shown in the examples presented earlier in this study, it seems to
persist. The model also has the advantage of being relatively simple
when compared to the range of factors---such as reference points,
optimism bias, and the endowment effect--- [that must be accounted for
in attempting to get a better grasp on human decision-making under
conditions where risk is involved]{.underline}. Senior civilian and
military leaders typically lack the time (and as Jervis suggests, likely
the interest as well) to plumb the depths of these phenomena. [Or
perhaps defense policymakers are simply unaware of these advances in the
behavior sciences or are engaged in an act of willful ignorance in an
effort to keep the range of factors they must consider in making
decisions at a manageable level]{.underline}. Those senior
decision-makers who do choose to dip their toe in the behavior science
waters can also raise legitimate concerns over the practical utility of
these recent findings. For example[, how does one determine how the
targets of a deterrence strategy locate themselves in a domain of gain
or loss? This is critical to determining whether the target is more or
less likely to be aggressive or risk tolerant. We cannot run tests on
Mr. Putin, the way men like Kahneman and Henrich do with their subjects,
to determine Putin's reference point and level of optimism
bias]{.underline}. National security policymakers could rightly note
that it is relatively easy to identify such frames of reference after
the fact, but far less easy to do so when projecting forward.163 Nor can
one necessarily be confident that adversaries actually believe what they
say and that they are not just posturing for effect. For example,
Chinese leaders harp incessantly on the "humiliations" their country has
suffered and are adamant that Taiwan is indisputably a part of China.
This would appear to place the CCP's reference point in the status quo
that existed when China's "century of humiliation" began in the
mid-nineteenth century, and China in a position of seeking to recover
what it has lost. This appears to convey a message that Beijing is
willing to run relatively high risks to prevent any Taiwanese move
toward independence. But it may also be simple posturing, and it is left
to the statesmen of other countries to figure out which it is. Finally,
many of the recent advances in the behavioral sciences focus on
individual, rather than collective, decision-making. As the work of
Simon, March, Marshall, Cyert, Roberta Wohlstetter, and Allison
demonstrates, even in governments that operate under the thumb of a
tyrant like Mao or Stalin, the decision-maker is typically influenced
significantly by bureaucratic actors and organizational preferences. As
Richard Thaler observed, "[Perhaps the most important conclusion to be
reached from this research is that making generalizations about
risk-taking preferences is difficult. General tendencies can be reversed
by a simple reframing of options. This result points out how difficult
it is to predict behavior.]{.underline}

#### This is particularly true in the context of Russia. Russia's willingness to use nuclear weapons as conventional warfare subverts traditional understanding of deterrence

That said, the international system is entering a new, more contentious
era. [The "unipolar era" that followed the Cold War and that saw the
United States enjoy a rare period of singular military dominance has
passed into history]{.underline}. [Not only is military power becoming
more **diffused**,]{.underline} thanks to the introduction of new kinds
of military capability[; it is also becoming increasingly
multidimensional]{.underline}. Moreover, military competitions have
expanded progressively into new parts of the globe and new domains to
include space, cyberspace, and the seabed. Given these and other ongoing
changes in the international security environment, it seems fair to ask:
[Will strategies relying primarily on deterrence prove as effective in
the coming years as they did during the Cold War and unipolar
eras?]{.underline} This study finds [that changes in the geopolitical
and military-technical environments are **eroding the effectiveness** of
strategies based on deterrence. Moreover, relatively recent revelations
of Cold War history and advances in the behavioral sciences raise
important concerns regarding our understanding of how deterrence has
worked in the past, as well as its limitations going
forward.]{.underline} In brief, [the efficacy of deterrence is being
challenged across multiple fronts]{.underline}. The United States
confronts an international security system which, unlike the system
between 1945 and the present, is not bipolar or unipolar, but
multipolar[. The emergence of major revisionist great powers in China
and Russia, combined with the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other
advanced military capabilities to second-tier powers, has increased the
number of rivals the United States seeks to deter, providing more
opportunities for **deterrence to fail**]{.underline}. With respect to
nuclear weapons, the radical reductions in U.S. and Russian Cold War
nuclear arsenals, combined with the growth in Chinese, Indian, and
Pakistani arsenals, is progressively shifting the competitive
environment from the bipolar Cold War framework to a multipolar system.
Consequently, [some nuclear postures that contributed to stability
during the Cold War---such as "parity"---may be problematic or even
impossible to achieve.]{.underline} The geopolitical environment is also
considerably more dynamic than either the Cold War system or the
U.S.-dominated unipolar system that followed it. This makes rapid---and
potentially highly destabilizing---shifts in geopolitical alignments and
[the military balance]{.underline} relatively more likely,
[present]{.underline}ing [additional challenges to]{.underline}
executing [strategies relying]{.underline} primarily [on
deterrence]{.underline}. Conventional weapons have become increasingly
precise, capable of effectively striking some targets once reserved
solely for nuclear weapons[. Advances in their design have enabled the
fielding of increasingly discriminate weapons.]{.underline} [Thus the
clear distinction that existed for most of the Cold War between
conventional and nuclear weapons has become progressively blurred. Yet
despite this trend, a significant number of Western political leaders
believe nuclear weapons' only use is to deter others from employing
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. This perceived decoupling could lower the
perceived risks of waging conventional war. On the other hand, some
civilian and military leaders [in countries like]{.underline} China and
[Russia]{.underline} assert that [certain types of nuclear weapons
are]{.underline}, in some cases[, available for use in a major
conventional war.]{.underline} [Deterrence may be compromised if Western
leaders see the risks that nuclear weapons will be employed in a
conventional war]{.underline} as minimal, while the Chinese and Russians
view these weapons as available for use. The introduction of
cyberweapons, with their enormous but untested potential, has further
muddied the deterrence waters. Insofar as cyberweapons reduce senior
decision-makers' confidence in their early warning and
command-and-control (C2) systems, they may be compelled to delegate
nuclear (or strategic) force release authority to subordinate
commanders, increasing substantially the number of individuals who can
authorize a strategic attack. [If even one of these individuals is more
risk tolerant than their senior decision-maker(s), deterrence will be
weakened]{.underline}. If the prospective attacker's decision-makers
believe the effectiveness of a rival's early warning and C2 systems is
significantly compromised, this would logically reduce the anticipated
costs (and risks) of executing a surprise attack during a crisis, all
other factors being equal. If so, the efficacy of deterrence would be
diminished. The uncertainty over the relative value and effectiveness of
these military capabilities is further complicated by the long absence
of war between major military powers, which provides the ultimate test
of military systems, force structures, and the doctrines governing their
employment. [As time passes, uncertainty increases with respect to the
true nuclear, conventional, and cyber military balances and their
interrelationships.]{.underline} The introduction of new capabilities
will complicate matters even further. This heightens the chances that
prospective belligerents will reach significantly different conclusions
about the true military balance and, by extension, the risks of pursuing
a proscribed course of action.

#### Ending these arm sales would signal a shift in US orientation towards Ukraine---it's sufficient to prevent crisis.

\*\*Minsk Agreement was a ceasefire agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine,
and two others which prevents nations from putting arms into Donbass

[America's recent decision to authorize the sale and delivery of Javelin
anti-tank missile systems to Ukraine was shortsighted and dangerous to
all parties involve]{.underline}d.\[1\] The provision of the Javelin
weapons system, in particular, serves as little more than a symbolic
gesture. In the end[, the authorization will likely prove a maneuver in
optics, not strategy.]{.underline} Furthermore, recent developments
suggest the Ukrainian government, in an effort to secure the deal, may
have interfered with the ongoing special counsel investigation in the
United States.\[2\] The following delineates the reasoning behind this
conclusion, puts forward some of the stronger arguments in favor of the
authorization, and describes why they are misguided. [Amid the fraught
U.S.-Russia relations of late, it is vital for American policymakers to
consider each geopolitical decision with the utmost care, ensuring the
best interests of the United States and her allies are always kept in
mind.]{.underline}\[3\] [An appropriate policy would include **forgoing
any further sale of lethal weaponry**]{.underline}, [replacing it
instead with increased funds and non-lethal materiel such as
counter-electronic warfare (EW) technology and the deployment of
additional troops on a strictly train-and-advise basis. The conflict in
Eastern Ukraine has claimed over 10,000 lives and forced over a million
more to flee their homes.\[4\] Taking these figures into
consideration]{.underline}, it is evident that decisive action is
necessary; thus far, [however**, the United States has taken the wrong
approach.**]{.underline} Arming Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles
[runs the risk of reigniting what has become a relatively static
engagement between the Ukrainian Army and Russian-backed
separatists.\[]{.underline}5\] [Skirmishes occur on a daily basis, and
casualties continue to accrue, but **a sudden injection of Western
munitions into the hands of the Ukrainian Army is likely to prompt a
disproportionate response from the side of the Russians**, a reaction
not without historical precedence]{.underline}.\[6\] Assuming the
Russians respond not in kind, but with asymmetric force, where does that
leave the United States? Is the United States to perpetually provide
bigger and better arms as the process persists in some sort of vicious
iteration of Robert Jervis's spiral model?\[7\] [For now, Russia has far
more at stake in this conflict. With his population's support and at
least six more years at the helm, Vladimir Putin can and will broaden
his country's efforts in the region if need be]{.underline}.\[8\] Even
if the United States were committed to meet every response with more
firepower, the Russians have the overwhelming advantage of geography.
Russia's shared border with Ukraine, one that is reportedly
near-impossible to effectively monitor, enables expedited
resupplies.\[9\] Putin's relative autonomy in terms of foreign policy
decisions also adds to the potential for a rapid response. Furthermore[,
it is prudent to consider how Ukrainians may interpret the **signaling**
of receiving lethal arms from America. Inspired by the renewed and
augmented support of the Americans, this move could embolden Ukrainians
to begin launching assaults, thus producing an avoidable escalation
scenario. Many like to frame the conversation as providing so-called
defensive weapons rather than offensive, but in reality, there is no
logical distinction between the two.\[]{.underline}10\] [The Ukrainians
using these weapons to go on an offensive, making the U.S. an indirect
accomplice in violating the Minsk Agreement, remains a real possibility
and a real concern of those monitoring the situation
closely]{.underline}.\[11\] From a purely practical standpoint,
providing Ukraine with Javelins makes little sense. While the provision
of such weapons would certainly generate substantial repercussions due
to the symbolism of the action, their usefulness on the battlefield
would be virtually imperceptible. In fact, former commander of U.S. Army
Europe remarked in 2015 that the Ukrainian Army having Javelin missiles
"would not change the situation strategically in a positive way."\[12\]
[Ukraine has no need for Javelin missiles, as it already produces its
own comparable varieties of anti-tank weaponry.\[13\] The Ukrainian Army
is well-equipped for situations that require anti-tank capabilities,
thus it is redundant to provide them with more. Furthermore, the
conflict has largely steered away from tank warfare, further
highlighting the superfluity of Javelin sales.\[]{.underline}14\] [The
provision of other lethal arms in general is similarly
excessive.]{.underline} Since the outbreak of the conflict, the
Ukrainian Army has improved its capabilities in almost every aspect of
warfare by orders of magnitude. Ukraine's current air, land, and sea
means are unrecognizable in comparison to those of 2014.\[15\] If
anything, the United States should be increasing support to help Ukraine
counter the innovative electronic warfare the Russian-backed separatists
are waging in the east.\[16\] An electronic warfare package would be
immensely more advantageous to the effort in Ukraine. The package could
include products such as the THOR III, CREW jammer, or MODI II systems,
as well as a contingent of U.S. electronic warfare specialists to train
Ukrainian soldiers using a strategy akin to the one released by the
Pentagon in 2017.\[17\] This recent Department of Defense approach lays
emphasis on the integration of burgeoning electronic warfare
capabilities throughout the gamut of military operations, the use of
cost-effective technology in lieu of conventional arms, and the
coordination of preparedness training for the rigors of conflict in the
electromagnetic spectrum.\[18\] These systems, among others, could make
a genuine difference in an electronic warfare space currently dominated
by the Russians.\[19\] As an added benefit, Ukrainian troops could later
be debriefed by their American counterparts on how the technology fared
in real-world application against the current leader in electronic
warfare tactics, providing valuable insight to be used in future
strategic planning. To further assist, the United States could take the
advice of a February 2018 Carnegie report, which suggests the problem
the Ukrainian Army faces now is not one of hardware, but of structure,
and a key component of successful reform is the expansion of Western
training efforts.\[20\] It is also imperative to acknowledge the
likelihood of American-made weapons systems winding up in the hands
other than those for whom they were intended. Time and again,
U.S.-supplied weapons are either stolen from the anticipated beneficiary
or never make it there in the first place. In just the last decade, this
happened in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, and
Mexico.\[21\] In Ukraine, the worry would be that the Javelins provided
by America could make their way into the arms of either some sort of
extremist Ukrainian militia such as the Azov Battalion or the very same
Russian-backed separatists the weapons were meant to combat.\[22\] [The
Ukrainian Army has lost control of countless weapons that have then
found their way onto the streets and online
marketplaces]{.underline}.\[23[\] In one instance, Ukrainian Army
vehicles were taken by separatists in broad daylight and subsequently
paraded about.]{.underline}\[24\] More importantly, non-lethal U.S.
military equipment, such as mortar-tracking radar technology given to
Ukraine in 2015, was stolen by the separatists not long after
delivery.\[25\] Assuming such a risk with lethal weaponry is needless
and should, under present circumstances, be avoided. The advocates of
arming Ukraine cite a number of well-intentioned, yet nebulous and, in
some cases, erroneous motives for their position. [The primary argument
is that the United States must support the independence of a democratic,
potential future NATO member.\[26\] The problem with this particular
belief is that the United States is and has been supporting the
independence of Ukraine for years.\[27\] Since the outset of the
conflict, the United States has provided over \$1.3 billion in monetary
assistance, training, and non-lethal materiel such as radar,
surveillance, and vehicles.\[28\] As argued above, there is no practical
need for the provision of lethal arms, so the support for Ukrainian
independence is, in effect, being realized. Another argument for arming
Ukraine is that doing so strengthens NATO; however, one can argue
persuasively that Ukraine is doing just fine without American anti-tank
missiles.\[29\] In the same vein as the strengthening NATO argument,
champions for the arming of Ukraine insist that lethal arms from America
will enhance European security. European allies of the United States
tend to have a different opinion.\[]{.underline}30\] [Representatives of
countries located within Europe, such as the former president of France,
Francois Hollande; German Chancellor, Angela Merkel; and U.K. national
security official, Mark Sedwell, have publicly stated their qualms with
a U.S.-provided lethal arms package,]{.underline} echoing the concerns
outlined above.\[31\] Also coming from within Europe, the European
Council on Foreign Relations has published objections to the idea.\[32\]
In a broader sense, current French president Emmanuel Macron has
recently called for Europe to achieve greater defense autonomy and rely
less on the United States. In his remarks, he suggested a move towards
security cooperation with the Russian Federation if the situation in
Donbas deescalates.\[33\] [There is no rational basis for providing
Ukraine with]{.underline} Javelin missile systems, or [any]{.underline}
other **[lethal weaponry]{.underline}**. Such a move has no positive
effect for the Ukrainians on the battlefield. Instead, the United States
is undertaking several wholly preventable risks with the prospect of
realizing zero strategic ends. The Ukrainian armed forces are capable of
sustaining their mission domestically. Arming Ukraine is symbolically
moral, but chances an increase in hostilities that could devolve into a
tit-for-tat proxy war, or worse. An entirely new U.S. policy towards
Ukraine is unnecessary. Rather, the existing policy of supporting
Ukraine is in need of amending, which can be achieved by a collaborative
approach on the part of Congress and the executive branch. A
three-pronged strategy is the best means of modifying the current U.S.
strategy. First and foremost, **[the U.S. must transition from the
provision of lethal means]{.underline}**, to non-lethal aid paired with
an advisory presence focused on countering Russian electronic warfare
capabilities. Next, in lieu of any further weapons deals, Congress
should author and pass a bill that allocates increased funds to be used
in providing Ukraine with non-lethal materiel, surveillance drones, and,
most importantly, counter-electronic warfare technology. Finally,
Congress should petition the president to authorize not only the
aforementioned equipment-provision bill, but also the deployment of
additional troops, with a non-combat mandate, to assist the Ukrainian
military with training and structural reforms.

### Next is the TERRORISM Advantage

#### U.S weapons will be stolen and sold to insurgents and separatists across the globe

**[[Grove & Barnes '18]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, Wall Street Journal,
By Thomas Grove in Moscow and Julian E. Barnes in Brussels Jan. 4, 2018

https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ukraine-try-to-ensure-weapons-dont-fall-to-enemy-1515067601

U.S. plans to arm Ukraine infuriated Russia and aggravated deteriorating
relations, but [a bigger worry is the weapons falling into enemy
hands---as has happened before. Washington last month decided to send
lethal aid to Ukraine to prevent aggression by pro-Russia separatists.
T]{.underline}he move is meant to keep the simmering conflict from
flaring into a hot war by improving government forces' ability to defend
against possible rebel offensives. [But the policy is fraught with
potential national-security pitfalls, particularly the risk of the
weapons ending up on the other side.]{.underline} U.S. officials say
they have carefully considered the dangers, taking particular
precautions with Javelin anti-tank missiles the Trump administration is
sending. Those weapons have been designated for units far back from the
eastern Ukraine frontline to ensure that Ukraine doesn't use them for an
offensive push and they aren't lost to the enemy if the fighting shifts.
They will be stored at training centers. American soldiers, who are now
at a base in far western Ukraine but could move to bases in more central
parts of the country, will regularly check and count them while training
units. "There is a \[training\] package that goes along with the weapons
that gives people on our side a lot of reassurance that we will be able
to keep tabs on them," said a senior U.S. official. [It's not a
theoretical problem. After the U.S. delivered short-range radar systems
to Ukraine in 2014, at least one was deployed to the
frontline]{.underline} near the eastern city of Debaltseve to detect the
site from which rebels were launching artillery attacks. [Separatist
forces overwhelmed the government troops, who fled and left parts of the
radar behind. Pro-Kremlin media triumphantly published
pictures]{.underline} of the components in their boxes. ["It was
interesting to get a look at the American technology," said Anton
Lavrov, an independent Russian military analyst, referring to the
published photos.]{.underline} A Ukraine military spokesman said it
intentionally destroyed parts of the radar system before the withdrawal
and immediately informed the U.S. An official close to the Russian
defense ministry said the capture was less a military-technology gold
mine than a psychological victory and chance for nose-thumbing at U.S.
policy. The problem hasn't been limited to Ukraine. The U.S. provided
aid, including training and equipment, to Georgia during its 2008
conflict with Russia-backed separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
and American-issued equipment was captured on Georgian bases. The
Russian official said that on a trip to Armenia, he met special forces
with U.S. gear, including boots, field jackets and knives, which he said
he identified from the brands and make. He said they told him they
bought it at an informal street market in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.

battle for Jalalabad, Afghanistan, in 1989. Photo: Robert
Nickelsberg/Getty Images A Pentagon spokesman noted that Ukraine and
Georgia are required to adopt the same security measures as the U.S. and
said it "conducts meticulous evaluations of physical security
preparations and capabilities." [Conflict Armament Research, a group
that documents sources of weapons in conflict zones, last month released
a report saying the U.S. provided Syrian rebels with arms contributed by
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, much of it Eastern European
surplus, that then made its way into the hands of Islamic
State.]{.underline} Responding to the report, the Pentagon said it was
monitoring alleged misuses and would curtail support for rebels if the
weapons were lost. Perhaps most notoriously, the CIA in the 1990s had to
buy back Stinger missiles it provided in the 1980s to Afghan Mujahideen
fighting the Soviet army, which it has never publicly acknowledged. U.S.
officials feared the shoulder-launched missiles could be targeted
against commercial jetliners or be used by Taliban forces. Today, arming
rebel groups in Syria or Afghanistan is far different from providing
arms to the Ukrainian government, the senior U.S. official said.
"Basically things work in Ukraine," the official said. "It is a totally
different thing than an ongoing civil war." Keeping Javelins from the
frontline also means they will not have a direct impact on the
battlefield. U.S. and Ukraine officials say the importance of the
weapons is not to push back separatist troops but to strengthen the
diplomatic push to settle the conflict. The Pentagon and State
department have argued that supplying lethal weaponry to Ukraine was the
right thing to do and wouldn't escalate the war. Trump administration
officials favoring a harder line on Russia have pushed for more robust
support. U.S. and Ukraine officials say it is critical the separatists
don't get hold of the Javelin missiles for fear they could be used
against Ukrainian tanks [The Russian official indicated the U.S. policy
was wise. He suggested separatists or Russia could potentially resell
them to a conflict zone where they could be used against U.S.
personnel.]{.underline} "I would keep them under lock and key, hundreds
of miles from the frontline," he said. "[Imagine if they get lost," the
Russian official said. "They won't be used in the same conflict, but
could find their way to an American APC\[armored personnel carrier\]
thousands of miles away, as a kind of lesson."]{.underline}

NUCLEAR TERRORISM AND PAKISTAN'S VULNERABILITY [The threat of terrorism
and possible use of nuclear]{.underline}, biological, and chemical (NBC)
[Weapons by terrorists was]{.underline} not ignored by many experts. On
March 20, 1995, the unimaginable Tokyo subway attack made the threat
[real]{.underline}. Five coordinated attacks released sarin gas on
several lines of [the Tokyo subway]{.underline}, killing 12 people and
injuring nearly 1,000 others.5 The [attack caused massive disruption and
widespread fear]{.underline} in a society that was previously perceived
to be virtually free of crime. Considering such risk, the security
levels of nuclear power plants and facilities housing nuclear and other
radioactive materials were augmented. Still, [Americans found the idea
of large scale terrorist attacks inconceivable prior to
9/11]{.underline}.6 [Richard Falkenrath, in his book America's Achilles'
Heel, recognized U.S. vulnerability to NBC terrorism. He elaborated the
consequences of an NBC attack as massive causalities, contamination,
panic, degraded response capabilities, economic damage, loss of
strategic position, social-psychological damage, and]{.underline} 224
[political change.]{.underline}7 [A recent report prepared by Nuclear
Consultants of Large & Associates cited an October 16, 2005, news report
entitled "Nuke Bomb Plot,"]{.underline} revealing that a group of
terrorists acquired detailed plans of Britain's most sensitive nuclear
sites and was planning a terror attack on a major nuclear target in the
United Kingdom (UK).8 In another event on March 22, 2006, BBC News
reported a "List of Terror targets Revealed" where a suspected terrorist
was allegedly involved in a plot to buy a "radio-isotope bomb." The
Sunday Morning Herald on January 6, 2007, reported, "Stolen Australian
Army rocket launchers are in the hands of a home-grown terrorist group
which planned to use them to attack Sydney's Lucas Heights nuclear
reactor, police allege." (See Figure 1.) Dr. Charles D. Ferguson
commented, "The good news is that the rockets would not have done much,
if any, significant damage to the reactor. The bad news is that the
emerging details of the case point to the harm that insiders can
perpetrate. If Australia moves forward with ambitious plans─as proposed
in the controversial Switkowski report─to build 25 nuclear power
reactors by 2050, it should take adequate precautions to guard against
external and internal security threats."10 He further argued that the
Australian Defense Forces have dozens of shoulder-fired Javelin
"fire-and-forget" missiles that have lock-on targeting and infra-red
(night-time) guidance, and such a long-range and high penetration that a
missile fired more than a kilometer away could have penetrated the
relatively thin shell of the nuclear shipping casks. [Getting hold of a
nuclear weapon or successful acquisition of nuclear material and
detonation of an IND by terrorists **could turn a modern civilization
into a smoking ruin.**]{.underline}**11** Dr. Charles [Ferguson outlines
nuclear terrorism in four approaches:]{.underline} 1. Theft and
detonation of an intact nuclear weapon (NW). 2. Theft or purchase of
fissile material leading to the fabrication and detonation of a crude
NW─an improvised nuclear device. [3. Attacks against and sabotage of
nuclear facilities, in particular NPPs, causing the release of large
amounts of radioactivity. 4. Unauthorized acquisition of radioactive
materials contributing to the fabrication and detonation of a
Radiological Dispersion Device]{.underline} (RDD)--a "dirty bomb"--or
radiation emission device (RED).12 [Any successful attack based on the
above possibilities would have catastrophic and far reaching
consequences. The damage that can be done by a large release of fission
products was demonstrated by the April 1986 Chernobyl accident. More
than 100,000 residents from 187 settlements were permanently evacuated
because of contamination by Cs-137]{.underline}. Strict radiation-dose
control measures were imposed in areas contaminated to levels greater
than 15 Ci/km2 (555 kBq/ m2) of Cs-137. [The total area of this
radiation-control zone was huge: 10,000 km2, equal to half the area of
the State of New Jersey. During the following decade, the population of
this area declined by almost half]{.underline} because of migration to
areas of lower contamination.13 Beyond contamination, Graham Allison
cited in his article that researchers at RAND, a U.S. Government funded
think-tank, estimate that [a nuclear explosion at the port of Long Beach
in California would cause immediate indirect costs worldwide of more
than \$3 trillion, and that shutting down all U.S. ports would cut world
trade by 10 percent]{.underline}.14 United Nations (UN) Secretary
General Kofi Annan said: Perhaps the thing that it is most vital is to
deny terrorists access to nuclear materials. Nuclear terrorism is still
often treated as science fiction. I wish it were. But, unfortunately, we
live in a world of excess hazardous materials and abundant technological
know-how, in which some terrorists clearly state their intention to
inflict catastrophic casualties. [Were such an attack to occur, it would
not only cause widespread death and destruction, but would stagger the
world economy and thrust tens of millions of people into dire poverty.
Given what we know of the relationship between poverty and infant
mortality, any nuclear terrorist attack would have a second death toll
throughout the developing world.]{.underline}15 Nuclear terrorism can be
a real threat to Pakistan. Pakistan has dealt with terrorism for some
time, with much of the root cause from the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan in 1979. The Soviet Union's departure in 1989 promoted
further unrest as it left behind an enormous arsenal of heavy weapons
and an internal conflict in Afghanistan that followed. Pakistan's
renewed alliance with the United States after 9/11 has increased the
threat of terrorism. General Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan,
describes the current situation starkly in his recent book: A deadly
al-Qaeda terrorist network entrenched itself in our major cities and the
mountains of tribal agencies on our western border with Afghanistan. A
culture of targeted killing, explosives, car bombs, and suicide attacks
took root.16 Major attacks continue in Pakistan, including the recent
suicide bomber who killed at least 42 soldiers in Dargai.17 However,
Pakistan had previously experienced such incidents of terrorism but
these were very target specific and mostly in retaliation for some
action taken domestically or outside our country. None of the terrorist
actions were designed to kill populations en masse or to cause panic on
a large scale. No such terrorist action was ever directed towards any
nuclear installation, radiation facility, or other hazardous industry.
However, a change in strategy of terrorists cannot be totally ignored.
As the threat of global terrorism has grown, so too has the Government
of Pakistan's nuclear power program. Today it envisages an expansion in
its nuclear power program from its current production capacity of 437MWe
to 8,800 MWe by 2030.18 Besides nuclear power plants, two research
reactors, and one 228 commercial irradiation plant (PARAS) at Lahore,
numerous high activity radioactive sources are being used for research
and development (R&D), commercial, industrial, and medical purposes. The
vulnerability of these facilities to nuclear terrorism cannot be
ignored, especially in the current context of Pakistan's active
participation with U.S. and Western Allies in the War on Terror.
AVAILABILITY OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL AND RADIOACTIVE SOURCES Today, there
are hundreds of tons of nuclear material, not just in the former Soviet
Union, but in dozen of countries around the world that remain
dangerously vulnerable to theft. As a part of Nunn-Lugar and other
initiatives, the United States has secured 54 percent of the buildings
housing such materials, leaving still substantial work needed to be done
before the target completion year 2008.19 Stocks of fissile material in
the United States, in spite of higher security measures compared to
other states, may be vulnerable to attack because of flaws in protective
measures.20 In a subcommittee hearing on April 27, 2004, an official of
the National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) of the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) admitted that Y-12, where the United States manufactures
and maintains the world's largest repository of 400 MT of highly
enriched uranium (HEU), has "some of the most difficult security
problems in the complex. Its facilities were built in the early days of
the cold war with no thought of the kind of threat we have now."21
Richard Levernier, a security specialist with the DOE, in an interview
in 2003 said "in more than 50 percent of our tests at the Los Alamos
facility, we got in, captured the plutonium, got out again, and in some
cases didn't fire a shot because we didn't encounter any guards."22
Several incidents of theft involving radioactive materials have been
reported. One of the most dangerous occurred in 2003 with the theft of
three of the world's most potent radioactive sources─Russian "nuclear
batteries"─each with the radioactive potential to make an urban area the
size of the District of Columbia uninhabitable. Fortunately, thieves
discarded the radioactive materials, retaining their pure metal
container housing, which they planned to sell as scrap.23 Nineteen
individuals were arrested in August 2003 in Ontario, Canada, on charges
of conspiring to destroy a NPP on the shore of Lake Ontario. This
reflects the interest of terrorist organizations in exploiting nuclear
facilities to cause grievous harm to the United States and its
friends.24 According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
database on Illicit Trafficking, there have been 827 confirmed incidents
of illicit trafficking through December 31, 2005.25 Of the 827 confirmed
incidents, 224 incidents involved nuclear materials, 516 incidents
involved other radioactive materials (mainly radioactive sources), 26
incidents involved both nuclear and other radioactive materials, 50
incidents involved radioactively contaminated materials, and 11
incidents involved other materials. Of the 224 nuclear incidents, 16
confirmed incidents involved trafficking in highly enriched uranium
(HEU) and plutonium (Pu). A few of these incidents involved seizures of
kilogram quantities of weapons usable nuclear material, but the majority
involved very small quantities. The nuclear proliferation by A. Q. Khan
was the most serious case in recent years. President Musharraf wrote, "I
can say with confidence that neither the 230 Pakistan Army nor any of
the past governments of Pakistan was ever involved or had any knowledge
of A. Q.'s proliferation activities." He further wrote, "There is little
doubt that A. Q. was the central figure in the proliferation network,
but he was assisted over the years by a number of money-seeking
freelancers from other countries, mostly in Europe, in manufacturing,
procuring and distributing, to countries like Iran and Libya materials
and components related to centrifuge technology."26 Radioactive sources
are widely used in almost every country in various applications
(industrial, commercial, medical, research and development, etc.).27 The
facilities housing radioactive materials have lighter physical
protection measures as compared to nuclear facilities, and therefore the
probability of terrorist hauling away such sources cannot be ignored.
Besides half-life, the activity content of a source and its relative
dispersability determine its relative security risk. High activity
sources which have been classified as high risks include radioisotope
thermoelectric generators (RTGs), commercial irradiators, medical
radiotherapy sources, and industrial radiography sources.28 [SPENT
NUCLEAR FUEL AND RADIOACTIVE SOURCES Among these various options and
given the tight security around nuclear power plants, terrorists can
target spent nuclear fuel and high activity radioactive sources in
transit as they can be rich and easy radiological dispersion devices
(RDD). Consequences of such an attack could be disastrous. The 400 power
reactors located worldwide produced around 255,000 tons of spent nuclear
fuel (SNF) by 2003, which will increase to about 340,000 tons by 2010
and to about 457,000 by 2020. The bulk of SNF (in tons) has been
generated by the United States (42,710),]{.underline} the United Kingdom
(41,430), Canada (27,860), France (30,480), Russia (17,860), Japan
(17,450), and Germany (9,660). Pakistan had generated around 240 tons
through 2000. This figure will swell with the operation of two nuclear
power plants to 1,180 tons by 2020.29 Spent fuel from a nuclear reactor
is the most radioactive type of material and constitutes most of the
high level waste produced by a reactor. It is very hazardous, highly
radioactive, and hot from the energy released by radioactive decay. Of
the millions of radioactive sources used worldwide in various
applications, perhaps only [several tens of thousands of these sources
are classified as high risk sources because of their high activity,
portability, and dispersibility.30 Among various radioisotopes, Co-60,
Cs-137, Ir-192, Sr-90, Am-241, Cf- 252, Pu-238, and Ra-226 are sources
of greatest security concern.31]{.underline} [Besides NPPs and two
research reactors, numerous high activity radioactive sources are being
used for R&D, commercial, industrial, and medical purposes in
Pakistan]{.underline}. Appropriate steps have been taken for the last 20
years to ensure proper tracking of all radioactive sources imported into
Pakistan (see Figure 4.1).32 Less than 6 percent of these sources fall
within the radioactive sources classifications of IAEA categories 1 and
2 (see Figure 4.2). The sources imported into Pakistan have found
applications in cancer treatments, R&D, industrial applications, etc.
(see Figure 4.3). All the radioactive sources are under strict
regulatory control right from import until their disposal. The Pakistan
Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) has been applying stringent measures
for administrative and engineering controls over such radioactive
sources from cradle to grave by the Sealed Radioactive Sources Stored
65% PINSTECH 90% KNPC 10% PAEC 49% Non-PAEC 51% Medical 12% Non-Medical
86% Medical 26% Non-Medical 74% Returned to Supplier 1 % Returned to
Supplier 1 % licensees. The security of radioactive sources is ensured
through periodic physical verifications and regulatory inspections.
SHIPPING CONTAINER DESIGN IAEA transport regulations require that spent
fuel transportation casks be evaluated for a series of hypothetical
accident conditions.33 These include a 30 ft (9 m) drop test, a 40 in (1
m) pin puncture drop test, and a fully engulfing fire with an average
flame temperature of 1475°F (800°C) for a period of 30 minutes. In
addition, the undamaged containment system of a cask must be designed to
withstand an external water pressure of 290 psi (2 MPa) for a period of
no less than 1 hour without collapse. Casks must maintain shielding and
criticality control functions throughout the sequence of hypothetical
accident conditions.34 In the United States, the NRC-approved spent fuel
transportation cask includes the HOLTEC HI-STAR 100 and the TransNuclear
TN-68 rail transportation cask.35 In Canada, transportation casks have
been designed for truck and rail transport. These include two designs
for transporting Canadian used fuel, the DSC, and the Irradiated Fuel
Transportation Container (IFTC) (see Figure 5.1). The IFTC is a
rectangular cask made of stainless steel with dimensions of 1566 mm x
1881 mm x 1697 mm. The wall thickness is 267mm and can hold 2 modules
(196 fuel bundles) for road transportation.36 IFTC has been designed for
transportation of 2 modules (192 fuel bundles) for road transportation
and each bundle contains 19kg of U.37 British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
designed, licensed, and currently owns and operates a fleet of Excellox
casks. BNFL ships SNF for the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and
Japan for reprocessing.38 Design features such as cask materials, its
thickness, cavity, and overall diameter are especially important for
assessing the vulnerability of SNF and high level waste (HLW) shipments
to terrorist attacks. Different shipping container designs could perform
very differently in response to an attack.39 Russia is working to
develop a next-generation SNF storage, transport, and disposal cask
system that meets modern-day requirements. Their requirements for the
casks are nearly identical. The leading candidate material is DUO2-steel
cermets. Bench-scale laboratory studies of this new radiation shielding
material are nearing completion, and the fabrication and testing of
onequarter scale demonstration casks is planned. This new material in
the cask offers increased protection against rocket and missile attack.
Thus, these new casks have the potential for superior resistance to
terrorist assault compared with conventional SNF pool storage.40 CONCERN
OVER SPENT FUEL TRANSPORTATION Materials like [spent nuclear fuel and
high activity sources under movement are much more difficult to defend
from adversaries]{.underline} than materials in fixed locations.
[Terrorist attacks against the transportation of radioactive material
can occur almost anywhere in any industrialized country]{.underline}.
Transporting thousands of shipments of nuclear waste across a country
would provide thousands of targets for terrorists, putting millions of
people at risk along the transportation routes. [Spent fuel is highly
vulnerable, and there are several tactics terrorists can use with a
higher-than-anticipated probability of breaching a shipping
cask]{.underline}.41 [Many are confident that the casks offer sufficient
protection]{.underline}. Gail Marcus, former president of the American
Nuclear Society, testified that the same features that render casks
highly resistant to highway and rail accidents tend to make them
difficult targets for an attack.42 The National Research Council also
assessed the vulnerability of spent fuel in transit and concluded that
"spent fuel transport containers are very robust and appear to offer
similar protection against terrorist attack. Studies on the
vulnerability of spent fuel transport containers to sabotage suggest
that relatively little or no radioactivity would be released in the
event of a terrorist attack."43 The United States General Accounting
Office also made an assessment: The likelihood of widespread harm from a
terrorist attack or a severe accident involving commercial spent nuclear
fuel is low, according to studies conducted by DOE and NRC. Largely
because spent fuel is hard to disperse and is stored in protective
containers, these studies found that most terrorist or accident
scenarios would cause little or no release of spent fuel, with little
harm to human health. Some assessments found widespread harm is possible
under certain severe but extremely unlikely conditions involving spent
fuel stored in storage pools. As part of its ongoing research program
and to respond to increased security concerns, NRC has ongoing and
planned studies of the safety and security of spent fuel, including the
potential effects of more extreme attack scenarios, including deliberate
aircraft crashes.44 Such a scenario involving Castor V/19 (PWR) and V/52
(BWR) were theoretically studied, based on a scenario in which a large
commercial airliner crashed into a storage facility housing 135 SNF
casks containing 170 MCi of Cs-137. A fire ensued and burned for 3 to 5
hours at 1000°C. It was estimated that about 0.04 MCi of Cs-137 would be
released.45 A still larger release could occur if a cask were attacked
in such a way as to initiate and sustain combustion of the zirconium
cladding of the fuel.46 Since the 1970s, DOE and NRC have conducted
several studies of the effect of an attack during the transportation of
SNF. These studies found that a successful attack would have a limited
effect on human health.47 A study published by the Department of
Energy's (DOE) Sandia National Laboratory in 1999 confirmed earlier
studies that, under certain worst-case scenarios, NRC-certified
transportation containers could be penetrated by armor-piercing weapons
and release small quantities of radioactive materials.48 [NRC and DOE
sponsored studies of the 1970s and 1980s were criticized by the Nevada
State Nuclear Waste Project Office (NWPO). They observed that the
previous analyses were inadequate as the fullscale test conducted by the
DOE did not use weaponry equivalent to the currently best available
armorpiercing weapons and that the NRC underestimated the health and
economic impact resulting from a terrorist attack.49]{.underline}
Guerilla armies around the world are known to be equipped with older
anti-armor missiles such as the Soviet RPG-7 and American M72. Such
weapons have the ability to penetrate up to 10-14 inches of armor plate
and pose a considerable threat to a nuclear waste shipping cask.50
[Terrorists could conceivably obtain one of the 12 or more anti-tank
weapons currently capable of penetrating 12 to 30 inches of tank
armor.]{.underline} [**More advanced missiles like the**]{.underline}
MILAN (see Figure 6.1) and [**Javelin could be effective** weapons to
penetrate or even perforate a large transport cask
containing]{.underline} SNF. Conceivably, [the Ontario Power Generation
shipping container (ITFC) with wall thickness of 26.7 cm or the HOLTEC
HI-STAR 100 and the TransNuclear TN-68 rail transportation cask cannot
provide any extraordinary defense against these anti-tank
missiles]{.underline} with armor penetration capabilities exceeding 100
cm. [It therefore determines the type of weapon that needs to be
evaluated in a terrorism risk assessment for spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste transportation.]{.underline} See Table 6.1
for current portable antitank weapons. Testifying for NWPO, Robert J.
Halstead stated: [An attack on the GA-4/9 truck cask would likely cause
complete perforation and release more than one percent of cask contents,
resulting in a release of about 8,000 curies, with fission products such
as Sr-90, Cs-134, and Cs-137 constituting over one-third of the total
curies, and Pu-241 20 percent or more. The consequences could be much
greater if the attack involved more than one missile or explosive
device, or if the attack included use of an incendiary device, or if the
attack were accompanied by a fire from combustion of the vehicle fuel
supply or another fuel source. Such exacerbating factors could result
in(1) a potentially larger percentage release of cask contents, possibly
as great as 10 percent; (2) a potentially higher percentage of
respirable particulates and/or vaporized radionuclides; and (3)
potentially more widespread dispersal and deposition.]{.underline}51 In
another testimony on April 25, 2002, [Dr. James D. Ballard stated that
the transportation effort]{.underline}, as it was proposed, [would
ensure a target rich environment wherein a terrorist could plan, pick,
and chose the time and place for an attack.]{.underline} He argued that:
[If the transportation vehicle were to be captured, placed in an
immobile state by any number of means, or once acquired it was able to
be moved at will by the terrorists, it would be susceptible to the
application of explosives and/or a human engineered breach. Thus, the
cargo could become a radiological dispersion device if the attackers
where to breach the cargo shielding and release the radioactive contents
into the environmen]{.underline}t.52 [In the aftermath of a July 2001
incident in the Howard Street Tunnel in Baltimore, Radioactive Waste
Management Associates prepared a study that concluded that, had SNF
casks been part of the train involved in that accident, the fire in the
tunnel would have resulted in a release of contaminating radiation
throughout a section of the city]{.underline}.53 In March 2003, [the NRC
released a similar report on the Baltimore tunnel incident and the
hypothetical consequences if a SNF cask had been
involved]{.underline}.54 It concluded that an SNF transportation cask,
approved under NRC rules for packaging and transportation of radioactive
materials (10 CFR 71), subjected to the conditions encountered in the
Howard Street tunnel fire would not release radioactive materials. In
addition, the health and safety of the public would have been
maintained.55

#### Extinction

Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand --

Envisaging Catalytic Effects", Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, 33(7),

A Catalytic Response: Dragging in the Major Nuclear Powers A terrorist
nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the
country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the
worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to
wonder whether [nuclear terrorism should]{.underline} ever [be regarded
as]{.underline} belonging in the category of truly **[existential
threats]{.underline}**. A contrast can be drawn here with the global
catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two
or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in
significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first
century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside
considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the
Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major
nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear
weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly
awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state
possessors themselves[. But these two nuclear worlds]{.underline}---[a
non-state actor nuclear attack and a **catastrophic interstate nuclear
exchange**]{.underline}---[are not necessarily separable]{.underline}.
It is just possible that some sort of terrorist attack, and especially
an act of [nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of events
leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or more of
the states that possess them]{.underline}. In this context, today\'s and
tomorrow\'s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the
early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals
who were seen as **[raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between
the superpowers started by third parties.]{.underline}** These risks
were considered in the late 1950s [and]{.underline} early 1960s as
concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It
may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially
plausible situation where an act of [nuclear terrorism could lead to
such a massive inter-state nuclear war]{.underline}. For example, in the
event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well
be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into
the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the
most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They
would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of
terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some
possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how
might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the
fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from
Russian
stocks,[40](http://www.informaworld.com.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/smpp/section?content=a923238837&fulltext=713240928#EN0040)
and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear
laxity? The correct attribution of that nuclear material to a particular
country might not be a case of science fiction given the observation by
Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear
explosion would be "spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its
radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a
wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency
of the explosion, the materials used and, most important ... some
indication of where the nuclear material came
from."[41](http://www.informaworld.com.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/smpp/section?content=a923238837&fulltext=713240928#EN0041)
Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete
surprise, and [American officials refused to believe that a terrorist
group was fully responsible]{.underline} (or responsible at all)
[suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors]{.underline}.
Ruling out Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France,
and probably Israel and India as well, [authorities]{.underline} in
Washington [would be left with a]{.underline} very [short list
consisting of North Korea]{.underline}, perhaps [Iran]{.underline} if
its program continues, [and]{.underline} possibly
[Pakistan.]{.underline} But at what stage would Russia and China be
definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In
particular, [if]{.underline} the act of [nuclear terrorism occurred
against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington\'s relations with
Russia and/or China]{.underline}, and at a time when threats had already
been traded between these major powers, [would]{.underline} officials
and political [leaders not be tempted to assume the worst]{.underline}?
Of course, the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if
the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed
conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each
other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments
may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a
nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of
heightened tension or even limited conflict with the United States,
could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise
domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or
encourager of the attack? [Washington\'s early response to a terrorist
nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an
unwanted (and nuclear]{.underline} [aided) confrontation with Russia
and]{.underline}/or [China.]{.underline} [For example]{.underline}, [in
the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist
nuclear attack, the U.S. president might]{.underline} be expected to
[place the]{.underline} country\'s armed forces, including its [nuclear
arsenal, on]{.underline} a [high]{.underline}er stage of
[alert]{.underline}. In such a tense environment, when careful planning
runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that Moscow
and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to
use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In that situation,
the [temptations to preempt]{.underline} such actions [might
grow]{.underline}, although it must be admitted that any preemption
would probably still meet with a devastating response. As part of its
initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier)
[Washington might]{.underline} decide to [order a
significant]{.underline} conventional (or [nuclear)
retaliatory]{.underline} or disarming [attack against]{.underline} the
leadership of the terrorist group and/or [states]{.underline} seen to
support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the
location of these targets, [Russia and/or China might interpret such
action as]{.underline} being far too close for their comfort, and
potentially as an [infringement on their spheres of
influence]{.underline} and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched
but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in
Washington that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist
action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with
what Allison claims is the "Chechen insurgents\' ... long-standing
interest in all things
nuclear."[42](http://www.informaworld.com.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/smpp/section?content=a923238837&fulltext=713240928#EN0042)
American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise
alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation
from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to
provide.

Antitank Guided Weapons This class of infantry weapons began to appear
in the early 1970s. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 among Israel, Egypt, and
Syria marked the first large-scale use of these weapons. Initial
interpretations of that war included spectacular predictions that the
use of wire-guided antitank missiles had rendered the tank obsolete.
Although those statements proved to be exaggerated, ATGW remain
formidable systems that can also be used against buildings, unarmored
vehicles, and bunkers. Compared with RPG-type weapons (which are covered
in the next section), ATGW are larger, usually requiring a crew of two
to four personnel to carry the launcher and ammunition (see Figure
2.24). Most ATGW are wire guided; the operator keeps his or her sight
fixed on the target after missile launch, and correction commands are
transmitted to the missile along the guidance wire. [The most modern
ATGW are fire-and-forget systems with no wire trailing behind the
missile]{.underline}; once the operator has locked the missile onto the
target, the weapon is fired and seekers aboard the missile maneuver it
to the target. In all cases, the system consists of a launcher and
control unit and the ammunition. Typically the ammunition is "clipped
into" the launcher and control unit. Once a missile is fired, the
gunner's assistants ready another missile by clipping it into the
launcher and making the required electrical connections between the
missile and the launcher and control unit. [Ranges of ATGW
vary]{.underline} from roughly 1,000 meters (example: the U.S.-made
Dragon of the 1970s) **[to more than 4,000 meters (the U.S.
Javelin]{.underline}** or the European HOT). [The warheads are usually
an antiarmor shaped charge that is optimized for armor penetration.
Under optimal conditions, modern, large ATGW can penetrate more than
600mm]{.underline} (roughly 24 inches) [of solid, rolled homogeneous
armor plate. The large warheads also have considerable blast effect,
thus endangering nearby personnel or unarmored vehicles that are near
the impact point.]{.underline} The warheads of some modern ATGW are
designed to detonate above the target, with the blast effect directed
downward against the vulnerable top of the armored vehicle target.100
[From a terrorist group's viewpoint, ATGW could provide a powerful,
highly accurate weapon with practical ranges of one to two miles or
more. The antiarmor warheads of ATGW, being designed to defeat heavily
protected main battle tanks, can **easily destroy any civilian type
vehicle in the world, including** armored trucks and **limousines**.
Although primarily designed for use against armored vehicles, ATGW have
frequently been used in combat against buildings and
bunkers.]{.underline} For example, the Israelis have often used
U.S.-designed Hellfire helicopter- launched ATGW to destroy buildings of
opposition groups such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization and
Hamas. The Hellfire is so accurate that specific windows on a building
can often be targeted. [**The terrorist application** of such systems
**is obvious.**]{.underline}

**CONTINUED...**

Attacks Using Antitank Guided Weapons [Although the advantages of
ATGW---their portability, excellent accuracy, powerful warheads, ranges
of up to four kilometers---are clear, there has, so far, been little
terrorist use]{.underline} of these weapons. During the 1990s, the
Hizballah group in Lebanon used a small number of ATGW against Israeli
armor. The Iraqi armed forces had several types of ATGW available but
used few of those in the 2003 war. There is little if any evidence that
insurgent groups in Iraq have employed these weapons, despite the fact
that some number of those weapons could easily have been obtained from
looted Iraqi Army and Republican Guard stocks. Indeed, Iraq's arsenal
included the old Soviet-made AT-3 Sagger, the much more advanced Soviet
AT-4 Spigot, the European-made Milan, and the heavy European HOT
missiles. [The lack of insurgent use]{.underline} of this type of weapon
[may be due to]{.underline} several factors, including [few weapons
being in their hands]{.underline}; insufficient training (although some
members of the insurgency in Iraq are clearly former soldiers, some of
whom could be familiar with these systems); [or maintenance issues of
the weapons (most or all of them may be in poor condition)]{.underline}.
The virtual absence of insurgent use is certainly not due to a lack of
targets or opportunity to use the weapons. [In the future, insurgents or
terrorists could employ ATGW in the United States]{.underline}. As
mentioned above, [the tactical advantages of the weapons are clear. An
ATGW is designed to destroy a tank. Consequently, an attack by a modern
ATGW would demolish all civilian vehicles, **including those used by
governmental officials.** Armoring such vehicles is not an available
option]{.underline}.

EVERYONE IN CANADA with any power has the same job. It doesn't matter if
you're prime minister, minister of foreign affairs, or premier of
Alberta; it doesn't matter if you're the mayor of a small town or a CEO
of a major company, if you run a cultural institution or a mine.
Canadians with any power at all have to predict what's going to happen
in the United States. The American economy remains the world's largest;
its military spending dwarfs every other country's; its popular culture,
for the moment, dominates. Canada sits in America's shadow. Figuring out
what will happen there means figuring out what we will eventually face
here. Today, that job means answering a simple question: [What do we do
if the US falls apart? American chaos is already oozing over the border:
the trickle of refugees crossing after Trump's election has swollen to a
flood; a trade war is underway,]{.underline} with a US trade
representative describing Canada as "a national security threat"; and
the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military the world has ever
known openly praises authoritarians as he attempts to dismantle the
international postwar order. [The US has withdrawn from the UN Human
Rights Council, pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, abandoned the
2015 Iran nuclear deal, and scorned the bedrock NATO doctrine of mutual
defence. Meanwhile, the imperium itself continues to unravel: the
administration is launching a "denaturalization task force"]{.underline}
to potentially strip scores of immigrants of their US citizenship, [and
voter purges]{.underline}---the often-faulty processes of deleting
ineligible names from registration lists---[are on the rise, especially
in states with a history of racial discrimination. News of one disaster
after another keeps up its relentless pace]{.underline} but nonetheless
shocks everybody. If you had told anyone even a year ago that border
guards would be holding children in detention centres, no one would have
believed you. [We have been naive. Despite our obsessive familiarity
with the States, or perhaps because of it, we have put far too much
faith in Americans]{.underline}. So ingrained has our reliance on
America been, we are barely conscious of our own vulnerability. About 20
percent of Canada's GDP comes from exports to the United States---it's a
trade relationship that generates 1.9 million Canadian jobs. This
dependence is even clearer when it comes to oil---something the Trans
Mountain pipeline expansion, which will ship our natural resources to
global markets, could remedy. The fact that the premier of British
Columbia tried to stall the project in a show of regional power is a
sign of a collective failure to recognize how perilous our position is.
Ninety-nine percent of our oil exports go to a single customer. And that
customer is in a state of radical instability. According to a recent
poll from Rasmussen Reports, 31 percent of likely US voters anticipate a
second civil war in the next five years. We misunderstood who the
Americans were. To be fair, so did everybody. They themselves
misunderstood who they were. Barack Obama's presidency was based on what
we will, out of politeness, call an illusion, an illusion of national
unity articulated most passionately during Obama's keynote address at
the 2004 Democratic National Convention: "There is not a liberal America
and a conservative America---there is the United States of America.
There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and
Asian America---there's the United States of America." It was a
beautiful vision. It was an error. There is very much a red America and
a blue America. They occupy different societies with different values,
and the political parties are emissaries of those
differences---differences that are increasingly irreconcilable. Many
Canadians operate as if this chaos were temporary, mainly because the
collapse of the United States and the subsequent reorientation of our
place in the world are ideas too painful to contemplate. But, by now,
the signs have become impossible to ignore. The job of prediction, as
impossible as it may be, is at hand. ★★★ AFTER THE MIDTERMS, special
counsel Robert Mueller presents his report to the deputy attorney
general, and America is thrown into immediate crisis. Congressional
committees call a parade of witnesses who describe the president's
collusion and obstruction of justice in detail. The Republicans respond
on television and through public rallies. Rudolph Giuliani, on Fox &
Friends, declares that "flipped witnesses are generally not
truth-telling witnesses." Trump airily waves away the Mueller report at
a rally for 100,000 supporters in Ohio: "I'm going to pardon everyone
anyway, so it's all a waste of taxpayer dollars." A ProPublica survey
shows Americans are divided on impeachment. Since the Republican base
remains overwhelmingly supportive of the president, the House
Republicans, arguing the need for "national unity," do not vote for
impeachment, which requires a majority in the House. The vote then goes
to the Senate, where Republicans refuse to remove Trump from office.
Mueller presses instead for an indictment. There is no legal precedent
for indicting a sitting president. The case proceeds to a federal judge
overseeing a grand jury and then eventually to the Supreme Court, which
has been tipped rightward with Trump nominees. The court rules that the
president cannot be indicted. Protests fill the streets of Washington,
New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Polls vary. Somewhere around 40
percent of Americans believe the government is legitimate. Somewhere
around 60 percent do not. [STEVEN WEBSTER is a leading US scholar of
"affective polarization," the underlying trend that explains the
partisan hatred tearing his country apart]{.underline}. In 2016, he and
his colleague Alan Abramowitz published the paper "The rise of negative
partisanship and the nationalization of U.S. elections in the 21st
century," which was one of the first attempts to track the steady growth
of the mutual dislike between Republicans and Democrats. [Affective
polarization is a crisis that transcends Trump.]{.underline} If Hillary
Clinton had won the 2016 election, the underlying threat to American
stability would be as real as it is today. [Each side---divided by
negative advertising, social media, and a primary system that encourages
enthusiasm over reason---pursues ideological purity at any cost because
ideological purity is increasingly the route to power. Abramowitz runs a
forecasting model that has correctly predicted every presidential
election since 1992]{.underline}. After he modified his model in 2012 to
take into account the impact of growing partisan polarization, it
projected a Trump victory in 2016---and Abramowitz rejected the results.
That should be a testament to the power of the model; it traced
phenomena even its creator didn't want to believe. Nobody wants to see
what's coming. Webster describes a terrible spiralling effect in action
in the US. Anger and distrust make it very difficult to go about the
business of governing, which leads to ineffective government, which
reinforces the anger and distrust. "Partisans in the electorate don't
like each other," he says. "That encourages political elites to bicker
with one another. People in the electorate observe that. And that
encourages them to bicker with one another." The past few decades have
led to "ideological sorting," which means that the overlap between
conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans has more or less
disappeared, eliminating the political centre. [But it's the people in
the parties, not just the ideas in the parties, that have changed.
"There's a really big racial divide between the two parties," says
Webster.]{.underline} The nonwhite share of the American electorate has
been increasing tremendously over the last few decades, and most of
those voters have chosen to affiliate with the Democratic Party. [What
worries Webster isn't that the Republican Party remains vastly whiter
than the Democratic Party, which, in turn, has become more
multicultural---though that's happened. The real source of the crisis is
that white Republicans have become more intolerant about the country's
growing diversity.]{.underline} According to the PRRI/The Atlantic 2018
Voter Engagement Survey, half of Republicans agree that increased racial
diversity would bring a "mostly negative" impact to American society.
During the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush years, there really
wasn't as much of a difference between the racial attitudes of white
people in both parties. That's no longer true. "During the Obama era, if
you look at just white Republicans, 64 percent scored high on the
racial-resentment scale. For white Democrats, it was around 35 percent,"
says Webster, who analyzed data from the American National Election
Studies. [The Republican Party has become the party of racial
resentment]{.underline}. If it seems easier for Americans to see the
other side as distinct from themselves, that's because it is. [The
loathing just keeps growing. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that
45 percent of Republicans and 41 percent of Democrats declared the
opposing party's policies a threat to the nation's
well-being]{.underline}---up from 37 and 31 percent, respectively, in
2014. Political adversaries regard each other as un-American; they
regard the other's media, whether Fox News or the New York Times, as
poison or fake news. A sizable chunk also don't want their children to
marry members of the opposing party. "A lot of people say, 'What would
happen if there were a very independent-minded candidate, a third-party
candidate with no partisan label, who would come and unite America?'"
Webster says. "That is absolutely not going to happen." In surveys,
independents seem to make up a large percentage, but if you press those
self-identified independents on their voting behaviour, they look just
like strong partisans. Abramowitz's own analysis of the 2008 election
suggests that only about 7 percent of American voters are truly
independent in that they don't lean toward one party or the other.
[America is becoming two Americas, Americas which hate each
other]{.underline}. If the Democrats represent a multicultural country
grounded in the value of democratic norms, then the Republicans
represent a white country grounded in the sanctity of property. [The
accelerating dislike partisans feel for the other side---the quite
correct sense that they are not us---means that political rhetoric will
fly to more and more dangerous extremes. In September 2016, Kentucky
Governor Matt Bevin gave a speech at the Values Voter Summit in which he
openly speculated about violence if Hillary Clinton were elected: "Whose
blood will be shed?" he asked.]{.underline} "It may be that of those in
this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren." [More
recently, Michael Scheuer, a former senior CIA official, wrote that it
was "quite near time" for Trump supporters to kill Trump
opponents]{.underline} (the blog post has since been deleted). [Such
explicit calls for violence are being driven by a dynamic of othering
that, once started, might not be easily stopped---except by disaster. "I
don't see an optimistic scenario here," Webster
acknowledges.]{.underline} ★★★ [THE MAN WHO **assassinates** the
president]{.underline} uses a .50-calibre Barrett rifle with
armour-piercing incendiary ammunition. He purchased it legally at a gun
show. The assassin's note, posted on Facebook the moment after the
assassination, amounts to a manifesto, but it's nothing Americans
haven't heard before. He quotes Thomas Jefferson, about the tree of
liberty refreshed by the blood of patriots. He [compares the president
to Hitler]{.underline}. "People say that if they had a time machine they
would go back and remove the monsters of history," he writes. "I
realized that there is a time machine. It's called the present and a
gun." The assassination of the president leads, at first, to a great
deal of public hand wringing. On social media, the assassin's heroism is
suggested and then outright celebrated. Within a month, the assassin's
face appears on T-shirts at rallies. [The assassination is used as a
pretext for increasing executive power, just as in the aftermath of
September 11. Americans broadly accept the massive curtailing of civil
rights and a dramatic increase in the reach of the surveillance state as
the price of security. SCOTT GATES]{.underline} is an American who lives
in Norway, where he studies conflict patterns at the Peace Research
Institute Oslo. His [work has been devoted to political struggles in the
developing world, where most of the civil wars happen. He now sees that
his research has applications at home. The question for the US, as it is
for every other country nearing the precipice, is whether civil society
is strong enough to hold back the ferocious violence of its politics.
Gates isn't entirely sure on that point anymore. Democracies are built
around institutions that are larger than partisan struggle; they survive
on the strength of them. The delegitimization of national institutions
"almost inevitably leads to chaos," Gates says, citing Trump's constant
attacks on the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the judicial system
as typical of societies headed toward political collapse, as happened in
Venezuela]{.underline} under Hugo Chávez. [The Supreme Court has already
been the engine of its own invalidation. Since the ideologically divided
Bush v. Gore ruling]{.underline} which decided the 2000 election, the
Supreme Court no longer represents transcendent interests of national
purpose. [Trust in the Supreme Court, according to a recent Gallup poll,
is split sharply along partisan lines]{.underline}, with 72 percent of
Republicans reporting approval compared to 38 percent of Democrats.
Mitch McConnell's decision to make the appointment of a Supreme Court
justice an election issue in 2018---an appointment that will likely not
get the support of a single Democratic senator---is an example of a
political institution being converted into a token in a zero-sum game,
exactly the kind of decision that has played a part in destabilizing
smaller, poorer countries. Once the norm has been shattered, it becomes
difficult to glue back together. [In a sense, **the crisis has already
arrived. Only the inciting incident is missing**. In December
1860]{.underline}, the fifteenth president of the United States, [James
Buchanan]{.underline}, believed he was offering a compromise between
proslavery and antislavery groups in his State of the Union address, but
his remarks preceded the Civil War by four months. His
declaration---that secession was unlawful but that he couldn't
constitutionally do anything about it---[became the moment when America
split and the war was inevitable.]{.underline} FEW AMERICAN institutions
now seem capable of providing acceptably impartial arbitration---not the
Supreme Court, not the Department of Justice, not the FBI. The [only
institution in American life still seen as being above politics is the
military]{.underline}, which, according to a 2018 Gallup survey, is the
most trusted institution in the country, with 74 percent of Americans
expressing confidence in it. [No surprise: the worship of the armed
forces has been ingrained into ordinary American life since the Iraq
War. Not so much as a baseball game can happen in the US without a
celebration of a soldier. Members of the military are even given
priority boarding on major US airlines. If civil order were threatened,
could America look to the troops to step in? In 2017, about 25 percent
of Democrats and 30 percent of Republicans said they would consider it
"justified" if the military intervened in a situation where the country
faced rampant crime or corruption. In an article in Foreign Policy, Rosa
Brooks, previously a counsellor to the US undersecretary of defence for
policy and a senior adviser at the US State Department, could imagine
"plausible scenarios" where military leaders would openly defy an order
from Trump. A coup would hardly be unprecedented, in global
terms]{.underline}: in Chile, in the 1970s, a democracy in place for
decades devolved into winner-take-all hyperpartisan politics until the
military imposed tranquilidad. [But even the armed forces might not be
enough of a power to stabilize the United States. There is a huge gap
between enlisted troops and officers when it comes to politics.
According to a poll conducted by the Military Times, a news source for
service members, almost 48 percent of enlisted troops approve of Trump,
but only about 30 percent of officers do. It appears that the American
military is as divided as the country.]{.underline} Would a coup even
work? The American military hasn't been particularly good at pacifying
other countries' civil wars. Why would it be any good at pacifying its
own? [THERE ARE trends---which no country can escape, or that few have
escaped, anyway---that forecast the likelihood of civil
conflict.]{.underline} A 2014 study from Anirban Mitra and Debraj Ray,
two economics professors based in the UK and US respectively, examined
the motivations underlying Hindu-Muslim violence in India, where Hindus
are the dominant majority and Muslims one of the disadvantaged
minorities. The two professors found that "an increase in per capita
Muslim expenditures generates a large and significant increase in future
religious conflict. An increase in Hindu expenditures has a negative or
no effect." That suggests revolution is not like the communist prophets
of the nineteenth century believed it would be, with the underclass
rising up against their oppressors. It's sometimes the oppressors who
revolt. In the case of India, according to Mitra and Ray's research,
riots start at the times and in the places when and where the Muslims
are gaining the most relative to the Hindus. Violence protects status in
a context of declining influence. "A very similar pattern of resentment
can be seen in the US right now," Gates tells me. The white
working-class community perceives its position in life as worsening. "At
the same time," he says, "the Latino community and the black community
have been improving their status, relative to where they were." In other
words, white resentment doesn't necessarily reflect actual changes in
financial well-being as much as frustration in the face of minorities
making significant gains. And, as status dwindles, the odds of violence
increase. Gates points to the bloody Charlottesville rally as the kind
of flashpoint fuelled in part by a sense of aggrieved white
diminishment. We can track the destabilizing effect of threatened status
in other conflicts around the world. A struggle between ethnic groups
losing and gaining privilege contributed, in varying degrees, to the
brutality between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda in the 1990s and to the
earlier Biafran War in Nigeria. THERE ARE deeper anxieties and more
troubling visions for anyone whose job is to predict where America is
headed. For the really scary stuff, you have to go to Robert McLeman,
who studies migration patterns and climate change at Waterloo's Wilfrid
Laurier University. He's got a kind of cheerful and upbeat way of
describing the spread of total chaos that's disarming. [Climate change
can bring about political chaos, in large part through migration.
"Military people call it a threat multiplier," McLeman tells
me]{.underline}. Usually, migration is the last resort, a response to
changes that are unpredictable and unexpected. So Bangladesh, to take an
example, will typically not experience mass migration because of flood,
because people in that region have been dealing with floods for
thousands of years. But a drought could cause a serious crisis, causing
waves of migration into India. As its departure from the Paris climate
agreement clarified, [America is barely able to face the fact that
climate change exists, never mind able to come up with effective
strategies to accommodate itself to the reality it is already
facing.]{.underline} In 2012, a hot and dry year in the US, soy bean,
sorghum, and corn yields were down as much as 16 percent. And, because
the country is a major producer of commodity crops, the drought pushed
up food prices at home and globally. There are a lot more 2012s coming.
And, of course, America is utterly unprepared for the vastly less
predictable catastrophes of climate-change extremes, as New Orleans and
Puerto Rico have both learned to their destruction. Most worrying to
McLeman is the fact that [American populations are growing in the areas
that are most vulnerable to unpredictable catastrophes]{.underline}.
They include coastal New York, coastal New Jersey, Florida, coastal
Louisiana, the Carolinas, the Valley of the Sun, the Bay Area, and Los
Angeles. Many Central Americans who were separated from their children
at the American border were fleeing gangs and political instability, but
they were also fleeing drought. "Environmentally related migration
already happens---we're just seeing the thin edge of the wedge right
now," McLeman says. Get used to refugees at the Canadian border. There
may be more of them. ALL RIGHT, you say, [there are conditions that lead
to civil war: hyperpartisanship, the reduction of politics to a zero-sum
game, the devastation of law and national institutions in the context of
environmentally caused mass migration, and the relative decline of a
privileged group. Fine. But]{.underline} when you land at JFK and line
up for Shake Shack, [where are the insurgents? Then again, in other
countries and in other times, it's never been clear, at least at first,
whether a civil war is really underway.]{.underline} Confusion is a
natural state at the beginning of any collapse. Who is a rebel and who
is a bandit? Who is a freedom fighter and who is a terrorist? The line
between criminality and revolution blurred in Mexico, in Cuba, and in
Ireland. The technical definition of a civil war is 1,000 battle deaths
a year. Armed conflict starts at twenty-five battle deaths a year. [What
if America is already in an armed conflict and we just haven't
noticed?]{.underline} What if we just haven't noticed because we're not
used to uprisings happening in places where there's Bed Bath & Beyond?
IF THERE IS [an insurgency-in-waiting]{.underline}, it [will likely be
drawn from the hundreds of antigovernment groups across the country,
many of which were readying for civil war in 2016 in the event of a
Hillary Clinton presidency. One of the most extreme examples is an
ideological subculture made up of "sovereign citizens,"]{.underline} who
believe that citizens are the sole authority of law. Ryan Lenz, a senior
investigative reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has been
researching them for nearly eight years. It's been a terrifying eight
years. [A 2011 SPLC report pegged the number of the sovereign citizens,
a mix of hard-core believers and sympathizers, at 300,000. The movement,
Lenz believes, has grown significantly since then.]{.underline} To put
that in perspective, the Weather Underground was estimated to contain
hundreds of members. Some guesses put the number of Black Panthers as
high as 10,000, a debatable figure. Both the Underground and the
Panthers---who talked a great deal about the justification for violence
but managed to commit relatively little---caused immense panic in the
late sixties and seventies and massive responses from the FBI. Sovereign
citizens, and antigovernment extremists as a whole, are part of a much
larger movement, many are armed, they anticipate the government to fall
in some capacity, and they are responsible for about a dozen killings a
year. The FBI has addressed them, and their growing menace, as domestic
terrorism. [In 2014, a survey conducted with US officers in intelligence
services across the country found sovereign citizens to be the country's
top concern, even ahead of Islamic extremists, for law enforcement.
Theirs is a totalizing vision of absolute individual freedom and
resistance to a state they believed is ruled by an unjust government.
Rooted historically in racism and anti-Semitism---they hovered on the
extreme fringes of American politics until the 2008 housing crisis and
the election of Barack Obama]{.underline}---sovereign citizens believe
they are sovereign unto themselves and, therefore, can ignore any local,
state, or federal laws and are not beholden to any law enforcement.
According to the SPLC, the sovereign citizens believe that the federal
government is an entity that operates outside the purview of the US
Constitution for the purposes of holding citizens in slavery.
"Understanding sovereign-citizenry ideology is like trying to map a
crack that develops on your windshield after a pebble hits it. It's a
wild and chaotic mess," Lenz tells me. Ultimately, the movement boils
down to a series of conspiracy theories justifying nonobedience to
government agents. Sometimes it expresses itself as convoluted tax
dodges, as in the case of the self-proclaimed president of the Republic
for the united States of America (RuSA), James Timothy Turner, who was
convicted of sending a \$300 million fictitious bond in his own name and
aiding and abetting others in sending fictitious bonds to the Treasury
Department. Turner was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. Bruce A.
Doucette, a self-appointed sovereign "judge," received thirty-eight
years in jail for influencing, extorting, and threatening public
officials. At other times, the spirit of disobedience expresses itself
in straight violence, as in the case of Jerry and Joseph Kane, a
father-son pair who, in 2010, killed two police officers at a routine
traffic stop in West Memphis, Arkansas. Or in the case of Jerad and
Amanda Miller who, in 2014, after killing two police officers at a
CiCi's Pizza in Las Vegas, shouted to horrified onlookers that the
revolution had begun. ★★★ THE SUMMERS grow hotter, and the yields on
corn and beans grow smaller. During the first drought, the declines are
small. The year after is more serious. Food prices spike. Inflation
rises, leading to a sharp jump in unemployment. China, holding \$1.18
trillion (US) of US government debt, dumps its bonds as a retaliatory
measure against US tariffs. This causes every other country to panic and
sell their holdings as well, bringing China closer to becoming the
global reserve currency. With the US bond market routed, higher interest
rates ripple through the economy, slowing it down. The hardest hit are
the farming communities dependent on commodity crops. The antigovernment
movements in these areas swell and organize. They elect local
politicians, particularly sheriffs. Pockets of the southern and
midwestern states, under these sheriffs, believe that the federal
government has no legitimate authority over them. By this time, a
Democratic president has come to power, with significantly more
socialistic ideas than any president in history. She eventually passes
legislation imposing national education and health care programs. The
local authorities take these programs as illegitimate government
interference and, in the heated rhetorical climate, claim the mantle of
resistance, which is also taken up by armed insurgencies. The National
Guard swiftly imposes order. But the states consider themselves, and are
considered by others, to be under occupation. THE BORDERS of North
America are, in their ways, as patchwork as those in the Middle East and
as nonsensical. The French lost to the English. The British lost to the
Americans. The Mexicans lost to the Americans. The South lost to the
North. The alignments of any political unity are forced; they defy
historical experience, geography, ethnicity, or political ideology. And
that's why it's all so breakable, so fragile. The antigovernment
extremists know who they are. They see themselves as the true Americans.
And who could deny there's a certain justice in the claim? What could be
more American than tax rebellion, the worship of violence as political
salvation, a mangled misinterpretation of the Constitution, and a belief
system derived sui generis that blurs passionate belief with straight
hucksterism? The next American civil war will not look like the first
American Civil War. It will not be between territories over resources
and the right to self-determination. It will be a competition over
distinct ideas of what America is. It will be a war fought over what
America means. Is it a republic with checks and balances or a place that
yields to the whims of a president's executive power? Is the United
States a country of white settlers or a nation of immigrants? It's also
possible, maybe probable, that the country will never get answers.

#### That goes nuclear---extinction

Historically, the only way that the slow bureaucratic creep of
government is reversed is through revolution or war. And that could
happen. But there\'s a problem: [the **next American revolution** won\'t
be fought with muskets. It could well be waged with **proliferated
wonder-weapons**]{.underline}. That is, about the time that American
yeopersons decide to resist the encroachment of the United Nations, or
the European Union---or the United States government---[the level of
destructive power in a future conflict could]{.underline} remove the
choice expressed by Patrick Henry in his ringing cry, \"Give me liberty,
or give me death.\" [The next big war could **kill everybody**, free and
unfree alike]{.underline}. Which leads to the second argument. Spaceship
earth may not be as fragile as a space shuttle, but it\'s still fragile.
By all means, let\'s have homeland defense and missile defense. But
let\'s also get real. [If the weapons get bigger, and the planet stays
the same size, then prospects for **human survival** shrink
accordingly]{.underline}. For the time being, North Korea seems to have
gotten away with breaking out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Kim Jong Il\'s arsenal could be eliminated in the future, of course, but
in the meantime, the atomic cat is out of the nuclear bag. Writing in
the February 3 Weekly Standard, Henry Sokolski, director of the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington D.C., offers up
scenarios for the spread of nuclear weapons that are much more
compelling than the scenarios for their unspreading. Countries such as
Iran, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, he
writes, have all flirted with the idea of building atomic weapons. And
one could add to Sokolski\'s list other countries, such as Brazil, where
the new president, Lula da Silva, seems to be forming an axis of
anti-Americanism with the likes of Venezuela and Cuba. Meanwhile, [every
one of those potential proliferators could be brought into line, and
we\'d still face the problem of \"**super-empowered
individuals**]{.underline}.\" Yup, the prospect of [Moore\'s
Law-computer power doubles every 18 months-affects **cyber**-geek and
**terror**-creep alike. Such **computational capacity** is inherently
\"dual use\" -the ultimate double-edged sword, hanging over **all of
us**, to be wielded by some of us]{.underline}. As technofuturist Ray
Kurzweil predicts, \"We\'ll see 1,000 times more technological progress
in the 21st century than we saw in the 20th.\" Most of that progress
will be to the good, but not all. [What could a **hacker-terrorist
alliance** come up with, weapon-wise? There\'s only one way to find
out]{.underline}. [Sooner or later, Moore\'s Law will meet Murphy\'s
Law, and we\'ll realize just how vulnerable we all are]{.underline},
**[six billion]{.underline}** souls, crowded into a narrow band of soil,
stone, air and water, hugging the flimsy, filmy, easy-to-rub-**[off
surface of the earth]{.underline}**. Let\'s hope that before we have
that rendezvous with deathly destiny, we\'ve had the foresight to build
an escape ladder for ourselves.

### Last is the CHINA Advantage

#### US arms sales directly tradeoff with Chinese influence in Ukraine

Nolan **[[Peterson 18]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, a former special
operations pilot and a combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, is The
Daily Signal's foreign correspondent based in Ukraine, \"US Weapons and
Chinese Cash Compete for Influence in Ukraine,\" Daily Signal, 1-8-2018,

Amid the backdrop of Russia's ongoing proxy war in the eastern Donbas
region, [Chinese infrastructure investments in Ukraine collectively
dwarf the]{.underline} total value of the long-awaited U[.S. weapons
deal.]{.underline} Those Chinese projects include a \$500 million loan
from China's CCEC trading firm---announced Dec. 22, the same day as the
U.S. Javelin deal---to finance affordable housing for, among others,
Ukrainian war veterans and people displaced by the conflict in the
Donbas. Ukraine's future is no longer---if it ever was---a binary
struggle between a pro-Western and a pro-Russian future. Now, [China is
decidedly in the mix, making steady inroads in Ukraine through
wide-ranging financial investments]{.underline} and infrastructure
projects intended to prepare the country for its role in China's One
Belt, One Road land trade route across Asia to Europe---a mantelpiece of
Chinese foreign policy also known as the New Silk Road. [As China's
economic clout in Ukraine grows, it could mean a loss of U.S. influence,
some experts say]{.underline}, possibly even playing to Moscow's
advantage. **["If Chinese investment]{.underline}** and Russian
aggression in Eastern Europe [**are not matched by corresponding U.S.**
economic and **military measures** in coming years, **the U.S.** and its
partners **risk ceding influence**]{.underline} in the region to hostile
revanchist powers," [Franklin Holcomb, a Russia and Ukraine analyst at
the Institute for the Study of War, told The Daily Signal in an earlier
interview.]{.underline} Upping the Ante? Since the outset of Russia's
hybrid war in 2014, [Ukrainian officials had been soliciting America for
lethal weaponry---the Javelin anti-tank missile in particular---as a way
both to defend itself from Russian aggression]{.underline} on the
battlefields of the Donbas and to deter Moscow from future offensives.
Former President Barack [Obama never approved the move]{.underline},
ostensibly due to fears of escalating the conflict by sparking a
tit-for-tat arms race with Russia. [However, after months of
deliberation, news broke]{.underline} Dec. 22 [that]{.underline} the
administration of President Donald [Trump had approved a
Javelin]{.underline} weapons [package]{.underline} for Ukraine
reportedly [worth \$47 million]{.underline}, comprising 210 anti-tank
missiles and 35 launchers.

#### Moreover, US arms sales displace Ukraine developing it's own defense industry

[The]{.underline} infrared-guided [Javelin is a fire-and-forget portable
antitank weapon]{.underline} whose export is strictly controlled by the
United States. Finally, in December 2017, [the State Department
announced Poroshenko would receive his missiles for
Christmas]{.underline}---or at least a fraction of his request: just 220
Javelin missiles and thirty-five launch units. This is not enough to
meet Ukraine's antitank needs. But [analysts have already argued that it
would be more cost-effective to help Kiev domestically manufacture its
own missiles instead. Ukraine was a major industrial center for the
Soviet war machine, and much of that arms industry remains---if not
necessarily in the best of shape]{.underline}. In particular, [Ukraine
is producing two new families of antitank missiles which might allow it
to counter new Russian tanks at much lower cost, and with fewer strings
attached, than the Javelin]{.underline}.

#### Defense industry capacity is a key internal link to Chinese-Ukraine engagement

The president of a top Ukrainian aerospace company says its new Chinese
investors often ask the staff for \"little conversations.\" They want to
know about record-keeping and planning, the setup of production lines
and the interplay between workshops. \"They\'ll talk for three hours,
and the next day, a totally different group of people will come,\" said
Vyacheslav Boguslayev, whose sprawling Soviet-era company, Motor Sich,
is one of the most advanced military aircraft engine manufacturers in
the world. \"They\'ll ask all the same questions as yesterday, and this
continues for a week,\" he said. [Racing to upgrade its military, China
has been turning to Ukraine. And Ukraine \-- with its economy scrambled
by hostilities with Russia \-- has been willing to accept China\'s
embrace. \"If they ban us from working with China,\" Boguslayev said,
\"then the first thing I\'ll do is fire 10,000 people.\" Motor
Sich]{.underline}, dubbed the \"Czar of Engines\" in the Chinese media,
[has what Beijing wants: It can supply warplane engines and the know-how
to one day possibly make a Chinese-built version. The Chinese, in turn,
have what Motor Sich wants: reliable buyers.]{.underline} The company
lost its biggest market \-- supplying engines for military helicopters
and other aircraft in Russia \-- after war broke out in eastern Ukraine
in 2014. Now it sells mainly to China. China\'s under-the-radar push
into Ukraine illustrates Beijing\'s hunger for technology imports and
its ability to access them even though Western countries have limited
military-related exports to China. [It comes as Ukraine struggles to
reorient its economy away from Russia. And it puts Washington in a
quandary as U.S. rhetoric supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia
collides with the Trump administration\'s widening competition with
-Beijing.]{.underline} \"Local people here are calm, well educated and
inexpensive,\" Liu Tsiun, the trade and economic adviser at the Chinese
Embassy in Kiev, said in an interview, speaking fluent Russian at the
embassy\'s walled villa in the Ukrainian capital. \"I always think of
Ukraine as having great potential in technology and science.\"
Ukraine\'s factories once churned out tanks, battleships and
intercontinental ballistic missiles for the Red Army. They became key to
the Russian defense industry\'s supply chain. In 2014, Ukraine\'s
pro-Western revolution and the outbreak of hostilities with
Moscow-backed separatists spurred Kiev to seek markets beyond Russia \--
its biggest neighbor and trading partner. But European and American
investors were nervous about dealing with a country reeling from war,
with crumbling infrastructure and widespread corruption. China, on the
other hand, saw an opportunity. [Ukrainian companies such as Motor Sich,
based in the city of Zaporizhia, about 100 miles from the front line in
eastern Ukraine, grew desperate as sales to Russia dried up. \"What we
care about right now is the following: Is America ready to buy our
goods? No. Period,\" said Gennadiy Chyzhykov, president of the Ukrainian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \"China does buy our
goods.\"]{.underline} China is on pace to surpass Russia by next year as
Ukraine\'s biggest single-country trading partner. In 2018, Ukraine
traded \$9.8 billion in goods with China \-- a 51 percent increase over
two years and more than double the \$4 billion in trade with the United
States. In the past year, China has garnered positive coverage in the
Ukrainian news media by making a series of gifts: 50 ambulances, 50
search-and-rescue vehicles, and \$137 million for medical equipment for
regional hospitals. In April, the Ukrainian government announced \$340
million in Chinese financing for a new bridge across the Dnieper River.
\"If someone comes with money, they\'ll take it,\" Andreas Umland, a
Kiev-based political analyst, said of Ukraine. \"They don\'t have the
luxury to think very strategically here many years ahead.\" At the time
of the 2014 revolution, China already had an economic and
defense-industry relationship with Ukraine. It bought an unfinished
Soviet-era aircraft carrier from Ukraine in 1998 and ordered four huge
military hovercraft in 2009. Western countries, by contrast, had little
use for Ukraine\'s Soviet-legacy defense production. \"One way or
another, Ukraine will have to choose,\" said one Western diplomat in
Kiev who is examining Ukraine\'s links with China and who wasn\'t
authorized to comment publicly. \"They cannot eternally integrate with
China while moving toward the West.\" The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry
declined to comment for this article. Ukraine-China relations are a
delicate issue, officials in Kiev said, given Ukraine\'s desire for
close ties with the United States on the one hand and China\'s expanding
partnership with Russia on the other. But Ukraine\'s new president,
Volodymyr Zelensky, who took office Monday, met with the Chinese
ambassador in Kiev early this month and offered a vote of confidence.
\"China\'s experience and investments are important to Ukraine,\" he
said. [China has been aggressive in expanding its influence across the
former Soviet Union]{.underline}. In Belarus, China is co-financing a
massive new industrial park to house more than 100,000 workers. On the
Black Sea, the country of Georgia is emerging as a key hub for Chinese
trade with Europe. [But Ukraine offers unique resources for China in
helping fill knowledge gaps as Beijing looks to build a world-class
military, Western diplomats and analysts say.]{.underline} Motor Sich\'s
Boguslayev said the only engines his company is building for China are
for aircraft that don\'t carry weapons, such as the L-15 training jet.
But Reuben Johnson, an American defense industry analyst based in Kiev,
said a tighter relationship with Motor Sich could allow China to
mass-produce its own fighter jets. \"The Chinese \-- for all of the
resources they have poured into the endeavor \-- have not been able to
develop reliable fighter-jet engines that are producible in large
numbers and run for enough hours between overhauls to be practical,\"
Johnson said. \"Acquiring the brainpower and the expertise of Motor Sich
could allow them to jump over that very big hurdle.\" A Chinese firm,
Beijing Skyrizon Aviation Industry Investment Co., tried to buy a
controlling stake in Motor Sich in 2017. Ukrainian authorities froze the
deal on national security grounds. But Boguslayev said that \$100
million of Beijing Skyrizon\'s promised \$250 million did come through
and that the Chinese company now owns a stake of at least 25 percent in
Motor Sich. A spokesman for Motor Sich said 35 percent of the company\'s
\$450 million in sales last year went to China, making the country the
company\'s biggest destination for its aircraft engines. No sales went
to Russia, the spokesman said. Six years ago, by contrast, one-third of
the company\'s \$1.1 billion in total sales went to Russia. \"Russia is
gone. So I have to be in China now,\" Boguslayev said. He said he hears
frequently from Ukrainian government officials that the United States is
unhappy with his dealings with China. His response: \"Then how about the
State Department gives us work?\" [Asked for comment about Motor Sich, a
State Department spokeswoman said the United States doesn\'t \"oppose
China\'s economic and technological development through legitimate
means. However, we are concerned by actions China\'s government has
taken that are out of step with international norms. \"The United States
encourages our partners to consider national security risks that may
arise from foreign investment transactions,\" the spokeswoman
said]{.underline}.

#### Chinese engagement solves Ukraine economic collapse

**[[GEFIRA '17]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, GEFIRA = Global Analysis
from the European Perspective. Preparing for the world of tomorrow, Is
China a Ukrainian ally?
https://gefira.org/en/2017/03/28/is-china-a-ukrainian-ally/

Economic cooperation [The Chinese-Ukrainian trade cooperation holds
great promise. Due to the low demand generated by the impoverished
population, Ukraine is not perceived by China as a recipient of its
goods but rather as a transit country. Ukrainian proximity to the
European Union, its political allegiance to it]{.underline} (Deep and
Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement) [could attract Chinese investment
and manufacturing. Also the EU is directly interested in modernizing
Ukraine, using Chinese money]{.underline}. The CEO of the Chinese
Commerce Association, Ruslan Osypenko, states that China appreciates
reforms in Ukraine and its companies are taking an increasing interest
in the country, which manifests itself in their uniting in a Chinese
Commerce Association. [Cooperation in agriculture is extremely important
for both countries]{.underline}. Just as an aside: already in 2015
Ukraine overtook the USA as China's number one corn supplier.4) Another
important part of Chinese-Ukrainian relations is the military-technical
cooperation. China is the world's 5th military exporter (USD 6,4 bln)
and the country searches for new technologies, especially in the
countries where fundamental and applied sciences do not have proper
financing. Ukraine has a huge military production potential inherited
from the Soviet Union times, however most enterprises lack funds and new
technologies. After 2014 Ukraine increased its exports of military
equipment to China for it to take 13% of the whole military imports of
China. Ukraine manufactures engines for the Chinese military: lately 2
Zhubr ships were sold. Surely, the real military cooperation must be
wider (most information is classified). This can become a basis for
stronger bilateral partnership.5) Ukraine, having a corresponding
technological and industrial background, is particularly interested in
cooperation with China in the space sector. Ukraine needs funding, while
China is turning into one of the leading investors in space exploration.
Kiev is now fulﬁlling 21 contracts with China worth a total of over \$67
million and has recently implemented its own 5-year program of space
industry development (2012-2017). China would also like to invest in
telecommunication (Huawei is already popular in Ukraine), and
traditional and alternative energy ('Naftogaz Ukraine' got a \$3.6
billion credit from National Development Bank of China and CNBM Company
owns several solar power plants in the Odessa region, with the whole
investment worth \$1 billion).6) The magnitude of the overall
Ukrainian-Chinese trade is not impressive. Presently, Ukraine is mostly
a supplier of resources of fourth production circle. Due to this fact,
China is not interested in a bigger investment in the country, such as
building schools and hospitals for political dividends like it does in
Angola or Congo. It can be stated that for the time being Ukraine is not
in the Chinese soft power vector. China is buying in Ukraine what it
needs, without however spoiling its relations with big political
players. Still, the cooperation with Ukraine is not the last item on the
Chinese government's agenda. It should also be noted that China will
support Ukraine politically in proportion to the tightening economic
relations between the two countries. The specificity of Chinese
companies is that they make decisions in compliance with the
government's foreign policy, which is why the Ukrainian government has
to invent such political environment as to attract the attention of
Beijing. 4th technological paradigm counts for 38 % of the country's
economy, while 57,9% goes for 3rd one. Political implication Most
Western and Ukrainian politicians complain about China being Russia's
close ally. It is not completely true, though. To make it clear, China
has its strategic interests in foreign relations and cooperates with
various countries as long as it is beneficial to China. After the
Russian annexation of Crimea, China called for a constructive dialogue
to find a proper political decision and stated that sanctions could not
be effective and that it would not implement them. For fear of losing
its important partnership with Russia, China could not respond
differently. Yet Ukraine's integration with the EU is of geopolitical
interest to China, if only because of the formation of the New Silk
Road. Generally speaking, Chinese interest in the European countries is
growing. After Trump's election there is a certain vacuum and
uncertainty in the European Union. On its part, Russia would like to use
the lack of American strong response to the Ukraine crisis and urge
European states to resurrect good relations with Russia. China is using
the opportunity of this vacuum in the EU as well. The similar logic may
apply to Ukraine. The country has lost its biggest trade partner --
Russia, and the EU could not substitute for Russia fully, nor has it the
needed amount of money to invest in Ukraine. Now since Ukraine is in
need of considerable support, it will readily accept China's investment
and presence on its soil. The economic cooperation during the Ukraine
crisis has been growing steadily for the last 3 years. At the World
Economic Forum in Davos this year, the Chinese president told his
Ukrainian counterpart that China was interested in close cooperation
with Ukraine and in resolving the crisis. With previous guarded Chinese
attitude to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, this new turn is
quite interesting.7) On the other hand, there is an issue Ukraine should
analyze before accepting Chinese assistance. Chinese investment in
Africa raised big concerns about the quality of Chinese infrastructure,
labour abuse and human rights violations. Ukraine should think it over
before accepting the partnership with an authoritarian state. Some would
claim that China has never supported the development of democracy in the
world or helped any country in the implementation of democratic
standards and human rights. Therefore, such a cooperation could be risky
to Ukrainian fragile democracy. Cooperation with Ukraine is beneficial
to the Chinese desire to decrease its dependence on Russia in many ways.
[For Ukraine, **China could rescue the country from economic collapse**
with its money and new technology]{.underline}.8) Although Ukraine is
seeking democratic development, the country should not abandon the
cooperation with non-democratic states on fair economic conditions. With
all the issues, Chinese-Ukrainian cooperation can have a potential.

#### Collapse of Ukraine's defense industry causes nuclear [PROLIFERATION]{.underline}

Renewed Proliferation Concerns [The cutoff of defense-industrial ties
between Russia and Ukraine is bound to exacerbate the economic crisis
already afflicting Ukraine, especially in the east]{.underline} of the
country, [which is now suffering from a military conflict as
well]{.underline}. Perhaps more worryingly, [the crisis will also
increase **proliferation risks of**]{.underline} dual-use,
**[nuclear]{.underline}**, and ballistic missile [**technology and
expertise abroad.** This is not the first time that proliferation
concerns have arisen in Ukraine. After the breakup of the Soviet Union,
Ukraine had the largest proliferation potential after Russia in the form
of scientists and specialists who found themselves out of work. In 1991,
the United States launched a pioneering series of programs designed to
ensure that the scientific and engineering talent of the former Soviet
defense-industrial complex did not fall prey to rogue regimes and
international proliferators.]{.underline} The Nunn-Lugar [Cooperative
Threat Reduction (CTR) program]{.underline}, created by then U.S.
senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, sought to secure the Soviet Union's
nuclear legacy. Under the auspices of the initiative, U.S. government
funding provided peaceful employment opportunities for tens of thousands
of scientists and engineers in the former Soviet Union who otherwise
would have been unemployed and left without means of survival in their
own homeland. [The Nunn-Lugar CTR program was a resounding success and
was recognized as such by the governments of both Russia and
Ukraine]{.underline}. Between 1995 and 2012, the scheme invested more
than \$1.3 billion in Ukraine to remove old weapons systems, improve
Ukraine's border security, and help nuclear scientists, engineers, and
specialists find alternative forms of employment. In 2012, the Russian
government felt it no longer needed assistance from the United States,
and an abridged successor arrangement was negotiated between the United
States and Russia to continue their joint efforts in the area of
nonproliferation. Although the United States has suspended its
cooperation with Russia in many areas following the annexation of Crimea
by Russia, some cooperation on nonproliferation has continued. That
cooperation must be maintained if the international community wants to
help Kyiv protect its most sensitive defense-industrial expertise. [The
importance of reducing the risk of proliferation should not be
underestimated. The number of possible buyers of Ukraine's nuclear and
ballistic missile technologies is fairly small but includes China, North
Korea, Syria, and Iran. Chinese and North Korean agents have on several
occasions been caught attempting to break into Yuzhmash and acquire
long-range ballistic missile technology. In 2012, two North Koreans were
arrested for spying after they tried to steal classified missile
technology from a Dnipropetrovsk-based designer of satellites and
rockets]{.underline}. There also exists well-documented reporting of
uncontrolled flows of small arms and light weapons into Syria through a
group of Ukraine-based individuals and logistics companies known as the
Odessa Network. [The risks of proliferation have worsened in recent
months. The current political, economic, and military crisis in Ukraine
has eroded the government's capacity to enforce an effective
nonproliferation regime. Despite the potential dangers of military and
nuclear equipment falling into the wrong hands, Kyiv's attention has
been absorbed by more pressing concerns of restoring basic stability.
The location of major Ukrainian defense industry enterprises in the east
of the country, where government control is at its weakest, underscores
the severity of the problem]{.underline}. The government of Ukraine
recently adopted new legislation on dual-use defense products that can
be used in the production of missile weapons and enhanced export control
over international transactions in the field of rocket technology. On
paper, that brings Ukraine closer to fulfilling its international
obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime, an informal
nonproliferation partnership it joined in 1998. However, in reality,
[implementing this legislation will be an additional challenge for a
government besieged by many other more immediate
challenges.]{.underline}

#### Prolif causes nuclear war---accidents, brinksmanship, adventurism, and preemptive strikes

**[[Kroenig 15]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Matthew, Associate Professor
and International Relations Field Chair in the Department of Government
and School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, 2015. "The
History of Proliferation Optimism: Does It Have a Future?" Journal of
Strategic Studies, Volume 38, Issue 1-2, 2015)

[The spread of **nuclear weapons** poses at least six **severe threats**
to international peace and security including: **nuclear war**,
**nuclear terrorism**, global and]{.underline} [regional instability,
constrained US freedom of action, **weakened alliances**, and further
nuclear proliferation.]{.underline} Each of these threats has received
extensive treatment elsewhere and this review is not intended to
replicate or even necessarily to improve upon these previous efforts.
Rather the goals of this section are more modest: to usefully bring
together and recap the many reasons why [we should be pessimistic about
the likely consequences of nuclear proliferation]{.underline}. Many of
these threats will be illuminated with a discussion of a case of much
contemporary concern: Iran's advanced nuclear program. Nuclear War [The
greatest threat]{.underline} posed by the spread of nuclear weapons [is
nuclear war. The **more states** in possession of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, [the **greater the probability** that somewhere,
someday, there will be a **catastrophic nuclear** war.]{.underline} To
date, nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare once. In 1945, the
United States used nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing
World War II to a close. Many analysts point to the 65-plus-year
tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that nuclear weapons are
unusable, but it would be naïve to think that nuclear weapons will never
be used again simply because they have not been used for some time.
After all, analysts in the 1990s argued that worldwide economic
downturns like the Great Depression were a thing of the past, only to be
surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting later in the decade and the
Great Recession of the late 2000s.48 This author, for one, would be
surprised if nuclear weapons are not used again sometime in his
lifetime. [Before reaching a state of **MAD**]{.underline}, [new nuclear
states go through a **transition** period in which they **lack** a
secure-**second strike** capability]{.underline}. In this context, [one
or both states might believe that it has an **incentive** to **use**
nuclear weapons **first**]{.underline}. For example, if Iran acquires
nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its nuclear-armed rival, Israel, will
have a secure, second-strike capability. Even though it is believed to
have a large arsenal, [given its small size and lack of strategic depth,
Israel might not be confident that it could absorb a nuclear strike and
respond with a devastating counterstrike]{.underline}. Similarly, [Iran
might eventually be able to build a large and survivable nuclear
arsenal, but, when it first crosses the nuclear threshold, Tehran will
have a small and vulnerable nuclear force]{.underline}. In these pre-MAD
situations, there are at least three ways that nuclear war could occur.
First, [the state with the nuclear advantage might believe it has
a]{.underline} [splendid first strike capability. In a crisis, Israel
might]{.underline}, therefore, [decide to launch a **preventive nuclear
strike** to disarm Iran's nuclear capabilities.]{.underline} Indeed,
[this]{.underline} **[incentive]{.underline}** [might be further
increased by Israel's aggressive strategic culture that emphasizes
**preemptive action**.]{.underline} Second, [the state with a small and
vulnerable]{.underline} nuclear arsenal, in this case Iran, [might feel
**use them or lose them pressures**]{.underline}. That is, [in a crisis,
Iran might decide to strike first rather than risk having its entire
nuclear arsenal destroyed]{.underline}. Third, as Thomas Schelling has
argued, [nuclear war could result due to the reciprocal fear of surprise
attack]{.underline}.49 If there are advantages to striking first, [one
state might start a nuclear war in the belief that war is inevitable and
that it would be better to go first than to go second]{.underline}.
Fortunately, there is no historic evidence of this dynamic occurring in
a nuclear context, but it is still possible. In an Israeli--Iranian
crisis, for example, Israel and Iran might both prefer to avoid a
nuclear war, but decide to strike first rather than suffer a devastating
first attack from an opponent. Even in a world of MAD, however, when
both sides have secure, second-strike capabilities, **[there is still a
risk of nuclear war]{.underline}**. Rational deterrence theory assumes
nuclear-armed states are governed by rational leaders who would not
intentionally launch a suicidal nuclear war. This assumption appears to
have applied to past and current nuclear powers, but there is no
guarantee that it will continue to hold in the future. [Iran's
theocratic government]{.underline}, despite its inflammatory rhetoric,
has followed a fairly pragmatic foreign policy since 1979, but it
[contains leaders who hold millenarian religious worldviews and could
one day ascend to power. We cannot rule out the possibility that, as
nuclear weapons continue to spread, some leader somewhere will choose to
launch a nuclear war,]{.underline} knowing full well that it could
result in self-destruction. One does not need to resort to
irrationality, however, to imagine nuclear war under MAD. Nuclear
weapons may deter leaders from intentionally launching full-scale wars,
but they do not mean the end of international politics. As was discussed
above, [nuclear-armed states still have conflicts of interest and
leaders]{.underline} [still seek to coerce nuclear-armed
adversaries]{.underline}. Leaders might, therefore, choose to launch a
limited nuclear war.50 This strategy might be especially attractive to
states in a position of conventional inferiority that might have an
incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to the nuclear level. During the
Cold War, the United States planned to use nuclear weapons first to stop
a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's conventional
inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has deteriorated since the
end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more heavily on nuclear
weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, Russian strategy calls for the
use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict (something that most Western
strategists would consider to be escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a
crisis. Similarly, Pakistan's military plans for nuclear use in the
event of an invasion from conventionally stronger India. And finally,
Chinese generals openly talk about the possibility of nuclear use
against a US superpower in a possible East Asia contingency. Second, as
was also discussed above, [leaders can make a 'threat that leaves
something to chance'.]{.underline}52 **[They can initiate a nuclear
crisis]{.underline}**. [By playing these risky games of nuclear
**brinkmanship**, states can **increase the risk of nuclear war** in an
attempt **to force a less resolved adversary** to **back
down.**]{.underline} Historical [crises have not resulted in nuclear
war, but many of them]{.underline}, including the 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis, [have **come close**]{.underline}. And scholars have documented
historical incidents when accidents nearly led to war.53 [When we think
about future nuclear crisis dyads]{.underline}, such as Iran and Israel,
[with fewer sources of stability than existed during the Cold War, we
can see that there is a real risk that **a future crisis could result in
a devastating nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. Nuclear Terrorism [The
spread of nuclear weapons also **increases the risk of nuclear
terrorism**]{.underline}.54 While September 11th was one of the greatest
tragedies in American history, it would have been much worse had Osama
Bin Laden possessed nuclear weapons. Bin [Laden declared it a 'religious
duty' for Al- Qa'eda to acquire]{.underline} [nuclear weapons and
radical clerics have issued fatwas declaring it permissible to use
nuclear weapons in Jihad against the West]{.underline}.55 [Unlike
states, which can be more easily deterred, there is little doubt that if
terrorists acquired nuclear weapons, they would use them.56]{.underline}
Indeed, in recent years, many US politicians and security analysts have
argued that nuclear terrorism poses the greatest threat to US national
security.57 **[Analysts]{.underline}** [have pointed out]{.underline}
the tremendous **[hurdles]{.underline}** [that terrorists would have to
overcome]{.underline} [in order to acquire nuclear
weapons.58]{.underline} **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, [as nuclear
weapons spread, the possibility that they will **eventually fall into
terrorist hands increases**]{.underline}. [States could intentionally
**transfer nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the fissile
material required to build them, [to terrorist groups]{.underline}.
There are good reasons why a state might be reluctant to transfer
nuclear weapons to terrorists, but, [as]{.underline} nuclear **[weapons
spread]{.underline}**, [the probability that a leader might someday
**purposely arm a terrorist group increases**]{.underline}. Some fear,
for example, that Iran, with its close ties to Hamas and Hizballah,
might be at a heightened risk of transferring nuclear weapons to
terrorists. Moreover, even if no state would ever intentionally transfer
nuclear capabilities to terrorists, [a **new nuclear state**, with
**underdeveloped security** procedures, might be vulnerable to
**theft**, allowing terrorist groups or corrupt or
ideologically-motivated insiders to transfer dangerous material to
terrorists.]{.underline} There is evidence, for example, that
representatives from Pakistan's atomic energy establishment met with
Al-Qa'eda members to discuss a possible nuclear deal.59 Finally, [a
nuclear-armed state could collapse]{.underline}, [resulting in a
breakdown of law and order and a loose nukes problem]{.underline}. US
officials are currently very concerned about what would happen to
Pakistan's nuclear weapons if the government were to fall. As nuclear
weapons spread, this problem is only further amplified. Iran is a
country with a history of revolutions and a government with a tenuous
hold on power. The regime change that Washington has long dreamed about
in Tehran could actually become a nightmare if a nuclear-armed Iran
suffered a breakdown in authority, forcing us to worry about the fate of
Iran's nuclear arsenal. [**Regional Instability** The spread of nuclear
weapons also **emboldens nuclear powers**]{.underline}, [contributing to
**regional instability**]{.underline}. [States that lack nuclear weapons
need to fear direct]{.underline} [military attack from other states, but
states with **nuclear weapons** can be confident that they can deter an
intentional military attack, giving them an incentive]{.underline} [to
be more aggressive in the conduct of their foreign policy]{.underline}.
In this way, n[uclear weapons provide a shield under which states can
feel free to engage in **lower-level aggression**]{.underline}. Indeed,
international relations theories about the 'stability-instability
paradox' maintain that stability at the nuclear level contributes to
conventional instability.60 **[Historically]{.underline}**, we have seen
that [the **spread of nuclear weapons** has emboldened their possessors
and contributed to **regional instability**]{.underline}. [Recent
scholarly analyses have demonstrated that, after controlling for other
relevant factors, nuclear-weapon states are more likely to engage in
conflict than nonnuclear]{.underline}-[weapon states]{.underline} and
that [this aggressiveness is more pronounced in new nuclear states that
have less experience with nuclear diplomacy.]{.underline}61 Similarly,
research on internal decision-making in Pakistan reveals that Pakistani
foreign policymakers may have been emboldened by the acquisition of
nuclear weapons, which encouraged them to initiate militarized disputes
against India.62 Currently, Iran restrains its foreign policy because it
fears major military retaliation from the United States or Israel, but
with nuclear weapons it could feel free to push harder. A [nuclear-armed
Iran would likely step up support to terrorist and proxy groups and
engage in more aggressive coercive diplomacy]{.underline}. With a
nuclear-armed Iran increasingly throwing its weight around in the
region, **[we could witness an even more crisis prone Middle
East.]{.underline}** [And in a poly-nuclear Middle East]{.underline}
with Israel, Iran, and, in the future, possibly other states, armed with
nuclear weapons, [**any** one of those **crises** could result in a
**catastrophic nuclear exchange**.]{.underline}

DOES PUTIN GO NEXT AFTER UKRAINE, GEORGIA, AND MOLDOVA?
=======================================================================
HEARING BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON EUROPE AND REGIONAL SECURITY

Foreign Relations,

The United States has the ability to rally its allies and international
partners around a comprehensive strategy that not only deters Putin\'s
aggression, but avoids an unstable gray zone in Europe East. To do so,
we should begin by articulating what we want to achieve. We should more
decisively increase the cost to Russia, including by enacting sectorial
sanctions and targeting Gazprom and Putin directly. The most effective
response is Ukraine succeeding and becoming a modern European state, and
[yet Western assistance to date is modest.]{.underline} There is no
governmentwide concerted effort to assist Ukraine. There is no response
commensurate with how we react to support campaigns like Ebola or ISIS.
The United States is uniquely positioned to assist Ukraine to defend
itself and to raise the cost of further Russian military action against
Ukraine. Putin, after all, has lied to his own people about Russian
forces fighting in Ukraine. But by reassuring Putin that we will either
not provide or greatly constrain our military and intelligence
assistance, we signal to the Kremlin what Russia can get away with. [Any
[assistance]{.mark} package [should]{.mark}, therefore, [be substantial,
including antiarmor missiles]{.mark}, as well as intelligence support.
Such [a U.S. decision could unlock lethal military assistance]{.mark}
from many of our allies.]{.underline} The U.S. Congress could also
endorse a more substantial military presence along NATO\'s eastern
flank, call for a halt to any further U.S. force withdrawals from
Europe, and order a review of the U.S. force posture. Such a package
could be designed to leverage U.S. commitment to European security to
secure greater European commitments to defense investment.

### FMS

#### Arms to Ukraine go through FMS

**Defence Blog, 7-8**-2019, \"Ukraine requested to purchase military
equipment through FMS program,\"
<https://defence-blog.com/army/ukraine-requested-to-purchase-military-equipment-through-fms-program.html>
JEJP

[Ukraine's Chargé d'Affaires, William Taylor, has confirmed that Kyiv
for the first time has requested to buy military equipment through the U
S. Department of Defense **Foreign Military Sales
program**]{.underline}. "I'm pleased to announce that Ukraine has
requested for the first time to purchase military equipment through the
U S. Department of Defense Foreign Military Sales program.", William
Taylor said. He also noted that the [U.S. Government already beginning
the review process for that request]{.underline}. "The United States
stands firmly with Ukraine in support of its sovereignty territorial
integrity, and defense sector reforms," added Ukraine's Chargé
d'Affaires. [According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the
Foreign Military Sales, or FMS program, is a form of security assistance
authorized by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as amended \[22 U.S.C.
2751, et. seq.\] and a fundamental tool of U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline} Under Section 3, of the AECA, the U.S. may sell
defense articles and services to foreign countries and international
organizations when the President formally finds that to do so will
strengthen the security of the U.S. and promote world peace[. Under FMS,
the U.S. Government and a foreign government enter into a
government-to-government agreement called a Letter of Offer and
Acceptance (LOA). **The purchaser does not deal directly with the
defense contractor**; instead, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
serves as an intermediary, usually handling procurement, logistics and
delivery and often providing product support, training, and
infrastructure construction (such as hangars, runways, utilities,
etc.).]{.underline}

[F]{.mark}oreign [M]{.mark}ilitary [S]{.mark}ale t[o Ukraine of Javelin
Missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} and Javelin Command Launch Units (CLUs)
for an estimated cost of \$47 million. The Defense Security Cooperation
Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this
possible sale today. The Government of Ukraine has requested to buy two
hundred ten (210) Javelin Missiles and thirty-seven (37) Javelin Command
Launch Units (CLUs) (includes two (2) Javelin CLUs to be used as
spares). Also included are Basic Skill Trainers (BST); United States
Government and contractor technical assistance, transportation, training
and other related elements of logistics and program support. The total
estimated cost is not to exceed \$47 million. This proposed sale will
contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of Ukraine. The Javelin system will
help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its
sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to meet its national
defense requirements. Ukraine will have no difficulty absorbing this
system into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The
prime contractors will be Raytheon/Lockheed Martin Javelin Joint Venture
of Orlando, Florida and Tucson, Arizona. However, [these missiles are
being provided from U.S. Army stocks and the CLUs will be obtained from
on-hand Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF)-purchased
stocks]{.underline}. There are no known offset agreements proposed in
conjunction with this potential sale. [Implementation of this proposed
sale will require U.S. Government and/or contractor representatives to
travel to Ukraine temporarily in order to conduct training.]{.underline}
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of
this proposed sale. This notice of a potential sale is required by law
and does not mean the sale has been concluded. All questions regarding
this proposed Foreign Military Sale should be directed to the State

Many argue that this lack of parliamentary representation means that all
the talk about Ukrainian fascists and the far right is simply Russian
propaganda. But this is wrong --- [at the extra-parliamentary level, the
radical nationalists have become much stronger]{.underline}. No party or
coalition of liberal NGOs can mobilize so many people on the streets as
the Ukrainian nationalists do every year on their key dates. These
include the day of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which is now a national
holiday in Ukraine (it wasn't before Maidan), and the birthday of Stepan
Bandera (the leader of the Ukrainian nationalists during World War II,
and of a movement which conducted ethnic cleansing of the Polish
population in western Ukraine, as well as collaborating with the Nazis
in the Holocaust). The nationalists gather tens of thousands of people
for these rallies, and it's incomparable to anything that the liberals
can mobilize. [The radical nationalists have also acquired arms, and
since the start of the war in the Donbass they have formed many of the
most prominent volunteer battalions.]{.underline} [The most important
was Azov, which started as a battalion and is now a regiment. In 2014
these were more like independent, autonomous forces, but gradually the
government tried to incorporate them into the official law enforcement
structures. Today Azov is officially a regiment within the National
Guard. This was "necessary" in order to take at least some control over
these units, but also means that we now have ideological nationalists
within the official law enforcement structures]{.underline}. This has
many dangerous consequences, for example in terms of the police's
treatment of nationalist attacks on minorities --- they don't intervene
seriously, and sometimes they even help the nationalists and blame the
victims. That's just one example, and of course this helps cover up the
far right's crimes. Today the deputy chief of the national police is a
former neo-Nazi who was Azov's deputy commander. Having someone in such
a high position is obviously an asset for Azov and other radical
nationalists. Some liberals try to argue that the nationalists in
Ukraine are not important, that they're irrelevant, not represented in
parliament --- compared with the results of forces like the Front
National, or Alternative für Deutschland. They say "Just look, Le Pen
got over 30 percent in the elections, and Ukrainian nationalists didn't
even manage to get into parliament!" But an obvious question here would
be: how many battalions does Le Pen have? None. Here, every
more-or-less-important far-right party has an affiliated armed unit,
which would be a very important factor in the case of a major political
crisis --- a resource that they could use, even if not for taking power,
then for influencing the composition of the government and the results
of elections. [Among liberals there is a strong trend not to recognize
the problem, to justify nationalists, to downplay the danger --- because
otherwise, it would play into the hands of Russian propaganda. This is a
very dangerous position which helps to cover nationalist
violence]{.underline}. Outrageously, respectable liberal media like BBC
Ukraine have given sympathetic reports on a neo-Nazi terror group, C14,
whose major activity is harassing and terrorizing opposition
journalists, bloggers, and citizens. In 2018 this group initiated a
series of attacks on Roma camps. And they long received primarily
sympathetic reports, with mainstream journalists trying to justify what
they were doing, to find excuses, to say that maybe they are just doing
what the state doesn't --- that the state doesn't repress that "fifth
column," those pro-Russian separatists, so these young "radical
patriots" are just doing the job of the state. And of course, this
legitimizes even more far-right violence. This also makes it hard to
articulate this problem for a Western audience, because you always get
these so-called "friends of Ukraine" who attack you as a Russian
propagandist. In fact, when the local opposition to the radical
nationalists is so weak in Ukraine, Western NGOs, international
organizations, and even Western governments could at least raise the
problem of human rights violations. For example, they press Ukraine hard
on corruption, and have forced the government to set up a system of
anti-corruption institutions. Yet they do not use their leverage to
condemn the radical nationalist groups which commit violence against
political, gender, and ethnic minorities. JP In November that year, you
[noted](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/13/ukraine-far-right-fascism-mps)
that "\[the far-right party\] Svoboda (as well as the Right Sector)
might well criticize the new government not only on nationalist grounds,
but also by highlighting a deteriorating economic situation." Indeed,
the far right often combines violent bigotry with a relatively
progressive economic stance; it is involved in vicious vigilante attacks
on Roma and other minorities but has also managed to gain a reputation
for providing practical support to poor communities. Can the Left learn
anything here? VI First, it's important to understand that radical
nationalists don't actually have so much popular support. It may seem
surprising, but they have more legitimacy within civil society than
among Ukrainian society at large --- many so-called "Ukrainian liberals"
are basically just moderate nationalists. The far-right parties'
electoral support, even if they were to unite, would at best be 5--10
percent. That's support for the parties --- support for some nationalist
ideas would be higher. The reason for this low support is that the
politics is dominated by much better-resourced oligarchic parties that
control the media and have money they can put into electoral campaigns.
In 2014, the oligarchic parties captured their nationalist-patriotic
rhetoric; and perhaps it didn't make so much sense to vote for the
radical nationalists if the so-called "centrists" were talking about the
same things. The oligarchic parties are also pretty good at capturing
social-populist rhetoric. It looks like neither Svoboda nor other
far-right parties can propose anything fundamentally different. The
major populist now is Yulia Tymoshenko --- the most probable winner of
the next elections. She's pretty strong in social populism, criticizing
high prices and even talking about stopping cooperation with the IMF. If
you have people like this, of very long standing in Ukrainian politics,
with resources and some oligarchic backing, then the far right don't
look like they're proposing anything much different, even if they also
talk about social redistribution. This is also a lesson for the Left. It
is often said that in speaking about identity politics the Western left
and has forgotten about material socioeconomic issues, and that's why
the far right is winning, as workers start to vote more for radical
nationalists and less for leftist parties. Ukraine actually gives
another lesson: that the Left must propose a really radical alternative
in terms of socioeconomic policies, and not simply some superficial
populist demands. These kinds of demands can easily be taken up by the
far right, by the right-wing populist parties, and if they can
capitalize on their better recognition and resources, and better
attitudes from parts of the media, they can outcompete the populist
left. So it is important that the Left develop a future-oriented,
consistent, progressive-looking agenda for radical social change. For
the Ukrainian left, the lessons of the Latin American left are probably
much more relevant than those of the current Western European left. We
can't simply copy tactics and rhetoric from Corbyn or Bernie Sanders,
Podemos or Syriza, because these parties are operating in
liberal-democratic regimes. The Ukrainian regime is definitely not
liberal-democratic --- it's increasingly authoritarian, nationalist, and
anticommunist. In this situation, the experience of the Latin American
left --- fighting pro-American right-wing dictatorships in the 1970s and
1980s, not necessarily in armed struggle but primarily by forming broad
democratic fronts --- could now be much more relevant for us. JP Is
there anything that the Ukrainian left in should learn from the far
right in terms of grassroots engagement with the poorest Ukrainians? VI
I'm not sure that engagement with the poorest Ukrainians was really such
an important part of the far right's success. Svoboda at least tried to
form front groups to penetrate civil society and meet popular needs
through its own ideologically affiliated leisure and cultural
organizations. But I'm not sure this has really been so important for
their success. More important has been the far right's readiness for and
skills in violence. Generally, Ukrainian politics before Maidan was very
nonviolent. Before 2014 we hadn't seen anything like, for instance,
France's gilets jaunes protests. This means that two generations of
Ukrainians, those born since the 1950s, didn't have direct experience of
massive violent protests. The most violent event in Ukraine before
Maidan happened in 2001 during the opposition campaign against the
then-president Leonid Kuchma. The clashes lasted for an hour or two,
mainly between radical nationalists and the police, and involved at most
a few hundred people. But the radical nationalists had the most
experience of violence among all protest groups and ideological
currents. They used these skills in the Maidan protests, when
opportunities for violent escalation were opened up by both the
extraordinary government repression and the moderate opposition's
inability to propose any effective nonviolent strategy against the
Yanukovych government. At this moment, the radical nationalists
intervened, and because of their skills at violence, their political
organization, and radical ideology, they could take up the role of a
violent vanguard for the movement. Violence is the most important
resource on which their limited popularity and success is based. After
Maidan they were ready to go to the war, to form battalions, to fight
--- and that has also aided their legitimacy within Ukrainian civil
society; they are "heroes" fighting for Ukraine. This readiness for
violence was probably much more important than their work with the
poorest Ukrainians: I can't say they even had a consistent strategy for
this, or really did anything important. JP The poet Serhii Zhadan
[said](https://www.facebook.com/HromadskeInternational/videos/251492172175472/)
recently that in Ukraine, "You can call 'left-wing' anybody you don't
like; this is a very good way to hurt somebody." Indeed, in the
discussion in which he was speaking, Oleksandr Sushko, the director of a
prominent NGO, sought to equate the "far left" with the far right. Are
attempts to discredit the very notion of the Left gaining ground in
Ukraine? VI Generally, yes. This is indeed a quite popular position in
civil society, which is usually strongly anticommunist. When the
government started its decommunization policies --- renaming streets and
cities and dismantling remaining Soviet monuments --- there was very
little public resistance. These policies laid the basis for banning the
Communist Party of Ukraine; the irony with this ban was that the party
was neither communist nor dangerous in any way, and was just a very easy
scapegoat that nobody would defend. The majority of Ukrainian civil
society took for granted that the ban was reasonable, although they had
banned a major opposition party --- something that should not be done in
any democratic polity. This was a party that had got 13 percent of the
vote as recently as 2012. The Left is politically nonexistent right now,
and so it becomes a scapegoat, an empty signifier onto which some groups
project everything bad. Nationalists very often attack the Left, but by
"the Left" they mean anyone who is for human rights, for minority
rights, who supports LGBT people. But subjectively most of these people
are liberals, often distant from Western leftist parties; they would
usually even share in popular conspiracy theories that the Left are
pro-Russian and paid by the Kremlin to undermine Western governments. JP
Given how easy it is in Ukraine for any explicitly left politics to be
smeared by association with the country's Soviet past, should emergent
left groups abandon tradition left imagery and language and build a new
idiom and aesthetics in which to couch radical social demands? VI It's
not a problem only with aesthetics, and it's not even a problem of the
Left's choices, because communist symbols are now banned, and use of
those symbols could be grounds for criminal prosecution. There have
indeed been some ridiculous cases where people got two years' probation
--- so, a criminal sentence --- for writing Soviet-era slogans on
Facebook. This is not really systematic, but occasionally it happens.
The ban on the Communist Party has minimized its public activity, and
the public activity of other left groups is also pretty minimal. It's
even difficult to have a public event without hiding its physical
location; usually, we have a preliminary registration where we try to
check the people who want to come to our event, and we send the address
only to those people we are sure are not radical nationalists and will
not leak the location. So, this is a semiunderground mode of activity.
So, I don't think that the aesthetics are actually a problem, because
even those groups that are trying to be as pro-Ukrainian and as
anticommunist as possible, while appealing to left ideas, remain largely
unsuccessful --- they're as marginal as the rest of the Left. The
problem is probably more general: the repressive political regime,
strong right-wing paramilitaries, the lack of resources, the weakness of
labor or any other progressive grassroots movements. All this encloses
the political left in a marginal niche. JP [On November 26, a thirty-day
period of martial law was declared across a large swath of Ukraine after
three of its naval vessels came under fire from Russian
ships]{.underline}. How do you interpret the origins of this situation,
and will it affect the presidential election, scheduled for March 31? VI
The incident itself owed either to the stupidity of some of those
involved, or to an intentional provocation by the Ukrainian ships,
possibly connected to the president. [Even if we do not accept the
Russian annexation of Crimea, and all its consequences, it doesn't mean
we can ignore the reality of Russian control over the Crimean Peninsula
and the adjacent waters of the Black and Azov seas. And here the
Ukrainian ships tried to ignore this fact.]{.underline} Yet the problem
is not so much what exactly happened, but how it was used by the
president. On the same day, he called for a Security Council meeting,
which proposed the introduction of martial law. The next day, parliament
didn't accept the original proposal --- martial law over the whole
territory of Ukraine for two months --- because this would have meant
postponing the elections scheduled for March 2019. Indeed, it seems the
Western leaders whom Poroshenko consulted were also very concerned at
this possibility. [In the end, parliament voted for martial law only for
the half of Ukraine adjacent to Russia, to the Black and Azov seas, and
to Transnistria --- mainly regions in which the majority of citizens
have an oppositional attitude and do not support the
president.]{.underline} Some politicians have described this as a
victory for the Ukrainian parliament --- that it didn't allow a coup
d'etat by the president. But the fact is that [martial law in any form
was unnecessary, because there were no serious grounds to believe that
the threat from Russia would grow]{.underline}. There have been many
other cases in recent years where there was a real threat to the
Ukrainian army: it suffered serious defeats in 2014 and 2015, and in
those cases Poroshenko didn't call for martial law because he was
interested in the elections and in stable financing from the IMF. Now,
before the elections, he is suddenly calling for martial law after a
relatively marginal incident. Despite this, a quite large majority in
parliament supported a more limited version of martial law. I expected
that [this would give Poroshenko a strong pretext for further such
measures, and incentivize him to escalate matters in Donbass or, better,
to conspire in some bloody incident in Odessa or Kharkov. That could
really have contributed to the atmosphere of fear]{.underline}. This
would also have provided good grounds for postponing elections that
Poroshenko now has very little chance of winning. He's very unpopular
--- polls tell us he is uncertain to reach the second round, where he
would in any case lose to any of his main rivals. However, he has not
yet made such moves. This is most likely because of his dependency on or
at least vulnerability to the West, where he keeps some of his own
valuable assets. The West sent clear messages against a prolonged state
of martial law. And this also suggests that the Kremlin is betting not
so much on destabilizing Ukraine as on the victory of politicians
friendlier (or less averse) to Russia in the parliamentary elections in
autumn 2019 or even in the electoral cycle that follows. Even faced with
a perfect opportunity to provoke Poroshenko, feeding a wider mistrust in
the president and extra-parliamentary opposition on the streets, it
looks like Putin is more interested in the elections. JP The current
front-runner to be elected Ukraine's next president is Yulia Tymoshenko.
Her positions are rather contradictory: she wants Ukraine to move
towards the EU and NATO, but also claims to stand against some elements
of IMF-mandated austerity. What should we think of her? VI She's just an
opportunist populist. She's not so much ideologically pro-EU and
pro-NATO; she just understands that the core electorate would probably
not accept any other geopolitical orientation. She needs to take this
line because otherwise Poroshenko would attack her as pro-Russian --- as
he has actively been doing already. He recalls that in 2009 Tymoshenko
made a deal with Putin over natural gas that turned out to be
disadvantageous for Ukraine, for which she was imprisoned under the
Yanukovych government. As an example of her opportunism, while she
understood the political game Poroshenko was playing, she still voted
for martial law. Otherwise, pro-Poroshenko trolls and opinion leaders
would have attacked her: "Look, she's not patriotic, she's pro-Russian,
she's playing into the Kremlin's hands," and so on. Another problem with
Tymoshenko is that she is unpredictable, not only at the level of her
views on the EU and NATO. The same concerns her social populist
rhetoric. This is an easy way to criticize Poroshenko: nobody wants to
pay more for utilities and so on, and obviously most people don't want
austerity --- they are poor and do not see many prospects in this
country. But that doesn't mean a Tymoshenko administration will really
be more redistributive --- definitely not consistently. But it would
still be a good sign if the elections were to happen, and she were able
to compete on a more or less free and fair basis. Otherwise, it just
means that there is no change, no hope at all. For his part, Poroshenko
is now running on very nationalist grounds --- his major slogan is
"Army, Faith, and Language." The very possibility of changing the
president through elections is important for its own sake, even if
Tymoshenko doesn't look more progressive. JP You
[wrote](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/ukraine-communist-party-ban-hysteria)
at the end of 2015 that "The left flank of Ukrainian politics is vacant
for now but won't be for long." Is this space being occupied again? Are
there likely to be any presidential candidates, however marginal, who
could reasonably be called 'progressive'? VI No, unfortunately not. The
Communist Party has decided to take part in the elections and will
probably try to find some technical way to do this despite the ban. But
the same man has been leading the party since 1993 --- its
unchallengeable leader Petro Symonenko, who has absolutely no chance of
winning serious support. Not to mention the question of whether the
Communist Party is really progressive --- and there are many grounds for
believing that they stopped being so many years ago. Ukrainian politics
doesn't have any left representation[. In the current parliament there
is not a single left-wing party, however broadly defined. Not even the
neoliberal left; not even the opportunist or reformist left. Even more:
there is not a single leftist member of parliament]{.underline}. It
looks like this isn't going to change in the next elections. [We'll see
a lot of flirtation with social populism]{.underline}, but this doesn't
imply egalitarian policies. The best outcome would be not a hope for
change, but that the country would not collapse in a total state failure
after the elections, which is not an impossible outcome [--- considering
the martial law precedent, the probable electoral falsifications, and
activity of armed paramilitaries. This doesn't give much
hope]{.underline} --- but I believe that it's objective. The lack of a
hope on the Left means the country is losing a sense of the future. Even
if Ukraine and particularly the youth proclaims its pro-Western
orientation, it actually stands in contrast to North American and
Western European youth who are becoming more and more leftist, while
Ukrainian younger generation is more neoliberal and nationalist than the
elder people. JP You've called for the resurgence of an internationalist
left in Ukraine. Could such an approach really gain traction in the
present political landscape, or should the Left first win back its role
as a leading force of Ukrainian nationalism? VI The basic problem here
is not even the Left's prospects in Ukraine, but whether the country
itself has a future. The state is undermined as social divisions
intensify and pull the country apart. This will not likely end up in a
Libyan or Syrian-style scenario, but these risks are pretty serious, and
this is a potential that must be recognized --- something must be done
to stop it. Against this background, the question of which kind of left
we might have is really rather marginal: there simply isn't one. From my
personal position, an internationalist left would be better than a
nationalist one. But it's also a problem of the general direction of
development of society. Of course, an internationalist left would much
more easily connect with the Western European left, with the North
American left, speaking to them in the same language and appealing to
the same problems. That would obviously be better for the development of
Ukraine's international connections, should progressive parties come to
power abroad. JP Looking at the global scene, are there any particular
social or political movements from which you think a nascent Ukrainian
left might draw practical lessons? VI As I said, the Latin American left
probably has the most relevant lessons for the Ukrainian left. Of
course, we need to consider some very important differences between a
post-Soviet country and Latin American ones, but at least some of the
problems that they have faced --- with pro-American authoritarian
regimes, with oligarchs, with large inequality, with right-wing
paramilitaries sound pretty relevant to what we're experiencing now, and
this is definitely something to which the Ukrainian left needs to pay
much more attention. Developments in the Western left can also serve as
an inspiration, showing that not everywhere is headed in a reactionary
direction; there are strong political forces, that bear a progressive
agenda, that can seriously fight for power. This is itself an important
argument for us --- that the Left is something legitimate. And, at least
for those who look towards Europe as some kind of model, this argument
can have some some traction: that these societies have a left, and so
should we. This may sound like a colonial orientation: that we need a
left because the West has one. The major point would be, [that we need
the left for Ukraine's own future]{.underline} --- not just to
copy-paste from Western models. If you would like to have this country
together, we need some space for leftist politics --- without them, the
country would probably just disappear. Progressive developments are very
unlikely, but the only alternative to it could be Ukraine's total
collapse.

### Arms Reductions Key

#### Arms sales block peace process, threatening escalation

Michael **[[Kimmage 17]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, professor of history

the Secretary's Policy Planning Staff at the U.S. Department of State

and Ricky comma PhD

In this spirit, the Trump administration's recent decision to provide
Ukraine with lethal weapons could appear not only wise but necessary.
The details of the deal announced by the State Department on December 22
have not been made public. According to reporting[, the deal entails the
sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles and small arms. Congressional
approval for these arms sales has not been announced but is assumed to
be forthcoming.]{.underline} The argument for providing lethal weapons
goes as follows: Russia has not lived up to its end of the bargain.
Ukraine is merely defending its sovereignty. With the Maidan revolution
of 2013 to 2014, Ukraine declared itself a part of the West --- a
strategic choice that was its sovereign right. In an atmosphere of
tension between the West and Russia, sending lethal weapons to Ukraine
signals toughness to an adversary predisposed to exploit the weakness of
others. [Perhaps these weapons, and the implied threat of more to come,
will be a salutary shock to the stalled Minsk diplomatic
process]{.underline}. Sanctions plus weapons give the West greater
bargaining power. They could compel Russia to back down. They are, at
any rate, the consequence of Russian perfidy. If this is the Trump
administration's thinking, it is wrong-headed. [Provision of lethal aid
to Ukraine, in tandem with the additional sanctions imposed on Russia in
July 2016 by Congress, amount to the death of Minsk. Military action has
displaced diplomatic action, with diplomacy sacrificed for a marginal
military gain.]{.underline} Whether applied before or after the Russian
presidential elections in March 2018, Western pressure will be
insufficient to force the Kremlin to comply with Minsk's provisions.
[Yet the way in which the pressure is being applied will surely increase
Russian intransigence where Ukraine is concerned.]{.underline} Minsk had
been faltering for a long time[. Now Russia will use the announcement of
Western military assistance to absolve itself of any need to comply with
Minsk or even to make a pretense of doing so. In a change that will have
serious regional consequences, the Minsk diplomatic process has become a
relic of the past. But instead of clearing the way to a plausible and
well-thought-through alternative, **providing lethal weapons unravels
what remains of the diplomatic process without changing the military
dynamic on the ground.**]{.underline} The American announcement of its
new policy sheds light on a transatlantic alliance that is out of synch.
Russia is almost certain to rely even more heavily on military means to
pursue its interests in Ukraine. This was, in short, an emphatically
counter-productive decision. The origins of Minsk illuminate the
treacherous terrain of a post-Minsk Europe. [Minsk was negotiated by
France, Germany, and Ukraine on one side and Russia and Ukrainian
separatists on the other.]{.underline} Minsk diplomacy followed a series
of battlefield defeats for Ukraine. When the Russian military drove into
the Donbas in August 2014, the Ukrainian armed forces could not keep
pace. Signed at gunpoint in February 2015[, the second iteration of
Minsk was a terrible deal for Ukraine, committing Kyiv, for example, to
an amnesty for the separatists and to special status of some kind for
the Donbas. Kyiv needed a reprieve from the battles it was
losing]{.underline}. The Europeans wanted to diminish, not increase,
fighting of which they wanted no part: There was no way for Ukraine to
escape its own military weakness and its lack of allies. [Once Minsk
kicked in, **combat dropped to a steady simmer**, with occasional flare
ups here and there. Kyiv was buying time, hoping for material Western
support or for the crack-up or exhaustion of Putin's
Russia.]{.underline} Western objectives for Ukraine, and the methods of
achieving them, were never clear. Some Western nations sought to work
with Russia and some sought to punish Russia. The common objective was a
restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty. This was something Russia itself
had endorsed, on paper, by agreeing to Minsk. This deal gave the West a
standard --- ceasefire, political process, the withdrawal of weapons and
troops --- to which Russian conduct could be held. European and American
sanctions fashioned in the summer of 2014 (before Minsk) became tied to
Minsk by 2015. [Sanctions would be lifted, Russia was repeatedly told,
only when Minsk was fully implemented]{.underline}. The Baltic republics
believed in the necessity of a military response[. They wanted more
American troops and hardware in the region; this they would receive;
Lithuania went so far as to supply Ukraine with lethal military aid,
starting in 2014. But Minsk was valued, especially by Germany, as a
non-military mechanism for de-escalating the conflict: better an
imperfect mechanism than no mechanism at all; and better no hint of war
than the prospect of going head to head with Russia. For Germany and
France, de-escalation meant stabilization and peace, and not reacting
militarily to Russia]{.underline}. The pursuit of Ukrainian sovereignty
divided into separate and conflicting strategies in the West. The
strategy of greater regional stability peacefully achieved (popular in
Western Europe) conflicted with the strategy of achieving genuine
sovereignty for Ukraine through military force and pressure (popular in
Eastern Europe). Washington was somewhere between these two positions.
The provision of lethal weapons outlines four challenges for the region
and for the West. **[First, public provision of lethal weapons will
foreclose rather than open diplomatic options for Russia]{.underline}**.
Second, [the West's strategic objectives in Ukraine have been
complicated by a deeper military involvement in the
conflict]{.underline}. The United States has had a military relationship
with Ukraine since 1991. Since 2014, the United States has offered
technical assistance to Ukraine and has helped to train the Ukrainian
military, with American advisors on Ukrainian soil. [Under the Obama
administration, this was construed as help for Ukraine, but a line was
drawn at being directly involved in Ukraine's war with Russia, which
explains the semantic importance of distinguishing lethal from
non-lethal assistance]{.underline}. This was, admittedly, a symbolic
difference, but it is a difference that, with the sale of lethal
weapons, has been erased. The West has crossed the line into direct
involvement. Chancellor Merkel, for one, was adamant about not crossing
this line, and transatlantic unity --- at one time the West's cardinal
asset in its conflict with Russia --- will now diminish further. [Third,
because of a hobbled diplomatic relationship between the United States
and Russia, whatever fallout there is from the lethal weapons decision
will be difficult to manage.]{.underline} Fourth, the prize of lethal
weapons, for which the Poroshenko government has been energetically
lobbying, is one that Kyiv has not done enough to earn. Perversely, [the
West's provision of lethal weapons is a domestic political boon to the
Poroshenko and Putin governments alike. Both can embrace a harder line
and in doing so posture before their more **nationalist domestic
constituencies**.]{.underline} [The line of contact will shade into a de
facto border, and **a peaceful resolution to this conflict will be
delayed indefinitely**. The price for a frozen conflict will be paid by
the Ukrainian economy and polity.]{.underline}

and Ricky comma PhD

The unilateral decision to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons will test
this foundation. [Congressional sanctions on Russia, levied in July
2017, were already greeted with horror in Europe, as further proof of
economic nationalism run amok in Washington: Germany, in particular, has
reacted to these sanctions as the dumping of collateral damage from the
U.S.-Russian relationship onto Europe]{.underline}. This was an early
crack in the West's common policy toward Russia. [Lethal weapons for
Ukraine will be a second crack,]{.underline} **[a revival of Donald
Rumsfeld's old and new Europe]{.underline}**. [In the Northeast of
Europe, the move to furnish lethal aid to Ukraine will be seen as too
little too late, though a sign that Washington has finally come to its
senses and is at long last facing up to the Russian threat. Western and
Southern Europe may refrain from direct criticism of the Trump
administration, in the name of transatlantic unity, but where Washington
goes in this conflict they will not be eager to follow]{.underline}. For
the many European countries who would gladly wriggle free from
Russia-related sanctions, "American adventurism" could be a convenient
excuse. [Long-term Western strengths have been sacrificed for a
short-term expediency that may prove the **opposite of
expedient**.]{.underline}

start arriving "in a very few weeks". Why it matters: **[The
decision]{.underline}** [in December by the US government to provide
Ukraine with "enhanced defensive capabilities" for the conflict in the
east of the country against pro-Russian separatists]{.underline}
**[could destabilize the shaky ceasefire that currently
exists.]{.underline}** [**Russian President Vladimir Putin warned in
September that any decision by the US to supply defensive weapons to
Ukraine could reignite the conflict**. The backdrop: Ukraine has been
battling pro-Russian separatists, backed by Russian personnel and
materiel, in the east of the country since April 2014, following
Russia's invasion and annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Moscow has
fomented the conflict in Ukraine in an attempt to halt the westward
drift of the country, which many Russians consider an historic part of
the Russian Federation]{.underline}. **[Ukraine has repeatedly requested
weapons from NATO]{.underline}** [to help its depleted military defend
itself against the well-armed pro-Russian militias,]{.underline} **[but
the alliance worried such a move would fuel the conflict]{.underline}**.
Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain, though, have pushed for more
aggressive steps to confront Russia in Ukraine. [There have been dozens
of ceasefires agreed since the start of the conflict, which has seen
more than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, killed.]{.underline} The
latest ceasefire saw violations decline during the Christmas and New
Year period, though they flared up again during February. After repeated
violations of the latest ceasefire by the pro-Russian separatists[, the
US State Department on December 23 announced the government would
provide assistance "entirely defensive in nature" to help Ukraine defend
its territorial integrity and "deter further aggression".]{.underline}
The Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine is preparing a new truce, the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
[said](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/01/c_137007728.htm) on
February 28. The latest: At a press conference on February 28, President
Poroshenko said there would be a number of different US weapon
deliveries, with the first to take place in several weeks, "starting
with the anti-sniper devices, because many Ukrainian soldiers were
killed by Russian snipers". Other weapons expected include tools for
electronic warfare and air defense. Poroshenko claimed, "the risk posed
by Russia's wide-scale war against Ukraine is decreasing thanks to the
strengthening of Ukraine's armed forces and continuing sanctions against
Russia". Poroshenko also said a recently adopted Ukrainian law on
reintegration of the territories controlled by the pro-Russian
separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions supports a diplomatic
solution to the conflict and the deployment of UN peacekeepers to the
region.

#### Arms sales lead to nuclear war.

**[[Pond 15]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Elizabeth, Analyst at Foreign
Affairs and Brooking "Do not arm Ukraine,"
[https://www.wiisglobal.org/do-not-arm-ukraine/)](https://www.wiisglobal.org/do-not-arm-ukraine/)//BB)

[Hawks in Washington are arguing that the West should deliver lethal
defensive weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces.]{.underline} At a
moment of political uncertainty in Moscow, [their view is that the NATO
alliance should show the Kremlin it is not feckless when faced with
Vladimir Putin's aggression.]{.underline} Such a policy would certainly
make the congressional Rambos feel good. But **[flooding Ukraine with
advanced weapons which its troops have not been trained to use would be
dangerous and almost certainly lead to an escalation that would play to
Russia's local military superiority while failing to bolster Ukraine's
capabilities.]{.underline}** There are three reasons for this. [First,
sending lethal weapons to Ukraine could sleepwalk the world into its
first nuclear war, at a time when the rules of restraint worked out by
the superpowers in the original Cold War have expired. Second, it
ignores the fact that Ukraine, once the war smithy of the Soviet Union,
is the world's tenth largest arms exporter. It would be far cheaper to
send ten executives on sabbatical from Boeing to Kyiv to advise Ukraine
on modernizing its own heavy weapons production. Third, given Ukraine's
history of corruption, deliveries of billions of dollars of weaponry
could tempt Ukrainian oligarchs to revert to business as usual as the
shock of Russia's year-old attack wears off. Western arms injections
could hardly save Ukraine from further dismemberment]{.underline}, given
the ratio of Ukraine's 121,000 active servicemen to Russia's 771,000 and
just over 2,000 Ukrainian tanks to Russia's 20,000. Indeed, a
demonstrative influx of western arms into Ukraine would simply force any
risk-averse demurrers in the Kremlin to join in common defiance of the
American bogey\[person\]man with the ultranationalists whom Putin has
empowered. Hawks in the West tacitly admit that Moscow holds 'escalation
dominance' in its own backyard by barring any western boots on the
ground. As Antony Blinken, the US deputy secretary of state, explained
in defending Barack Obama's scepticism about funnelling weapons to Kyiv:
['Anything we did as countries in terms of military support for Ukraine
is likely to be matched and then doubled, tripled and quadrupled by
Russia.' Russia, the regional military giant, can instantly trump each
western military initiative in any upward spiral.]{.underline} Its claim
to an existential geopolitical interest in neighbouring Ukraine also
trumps the distant West's half-hearted, peripheral interest. [Where
western hawks fail the sobriety test is in their refusal to specify how
they would respond in the next weeks if a game of chicken proceeds on
Russian rules and Moscow keeps raising the stakes all the way up to the
nuclear level. This is not idle speculation. Putin has said that he was
ready to put nuclear forces on alert to defend his original takeover of
Crimea a year ago.]{.underline}

[Raytheon](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-ukraine/u-s-approves-possible-sale-of-anti-tank-missiles-to-ukraine-idUSKCN1GD6DK))
in 2018 to provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. [The U.S.
Pentagon
said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-ukraine/u-s-approves-possible-sale-of-anti-tank-missiles-to-ukraine-idUSKCN1GD6DK):
\"The Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense
capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to
meet its national defense requirements.\" But Lockheed Martin likely
profited handsomely from the deal. Meanwhile, the company\'s [financial
reports](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-01-29-Lockheed-Martin-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2018-Results)
showed fourth quarter 2018 net sales of \$14.4 billion, compared to
\$13.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. This year, the company is
expecting sales to grow [by as much as 6
percent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-23/lockheed-s-2019-sales-forecast-bodes-well-for-defense-spending).
This is unlikely to be the case if the number of conflicts around the
world declines. It\'s clear why Washington wants to sell more weapons to
Ukraine. But whether Ukraine remains receptive and willing to continue
buying them may hinge on the outcome of the upcoming presidential
election, which is scheduled for Sunday. Presidential candidate
Volodymyr Zelensky, who is leading in the polls, seems to offer hope
that Ukraine may change its current strategy. This is reflected in a
statement [Zelensky made in
March](https://www.unian.info/politics/10465101-zelensky-about-war-in-donbas-negotiations-with-russia-inevitable.html)
in which he emphasized the need to negotiate with Russia in order to
\"save people\'s lives.\" Is there a solution? As well as better
diplomacy, Zelensky also sees direct democracy as a way to resolve the
crisis. [Rather than pursuing the same ineffective policy, which has
achieved absolutely nothing except for a greater death toll and growing
human misery, he proposed a
[referendum](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/78218) on the outcome of his
negotiations with Russia on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. This
approach might not lead to a quick fix or immediately restore peace in
the region \-- but it is more likely to succeed than simply supplying
more weapons with which to prolong the fighting. The West should not
abandon its rhetoric of support for Ukraine\'s territorial
integrity.]{.underline} But **[policymakers]{.underline}** and society
more **[broadly should be careful not to assume that simply selling more
weapons to Ukraine will yield a definitive victory over
Russia]{.underline}** and its separatist allies. While the ongoing war
in the eastern Donbas region and the recent Kerch incident offer an
opportunity for big businesses to make a profit, it\'s ordinary people
who will pay the price. **[The current approach to de-escalating the
conflict needs to be dramatically re-evaluated \-- and lethal weapons

#### Javelin missiles escalate the crisis and don't change the balance of power.

On March 1, [the State Department authorized the sale of 210 Javelin
anti-tank missiles to Ukraine]{.underline}. Sen. Joni
[Ernst]{.underline} (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, applauded the sale because she [said it shows the United
States is "serious about protecting the interests of our nation," and
will help Kiev "push back against growing Russian aggression." **It is
more likely, however, that this sale will accomplish the
opposite.**]{.underline} The official press release from the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) in regards to the sale claimed that
the weapons "will contribute to the foreign policy and national security
of the United States by improving the security of Ukraine." Yet it is no
small distinction to point out that [Ukraine is not an ally of the
United States, and we must question why improving their security is
worth degrading our relations with a nuclear-armed Russia.]{.underline}
A military alliance is a commitment to another party that we will
sacrifice American sons and daughters for their benefit. To make such a
significant sacrifice, there must be a vital national interest at stake
for America. As important, entering into an alliance requires that the
other side be willing to sacrifice for our security, and that the ties
result in a benefit to the United States. None of those factors exist in
this case. [The benefit is all to Kiev---and America absorbs risk
without the potential for reward. **Not only will the sale of lethal
arms not materially help Ukraine, but also it will likely increase
Russian and separatist opposition, worsening the
situation.**]{.underline} A change in the methodology of how the
government engages internationally is needed. Whether in Ukraine or
another international engagement, if an honest analysis reveals that the
United States has merely a secondary or tertiary interest---rather than
a core national interest---yet commits itself to expending valuable
political or military capital, the chances are high that such engagement
would end up costing more than would be gained. Why should Washington
spend money and risk the lives of our troops for a mission that would
leave the country at a net loss? [In the current standoff in the
Ukraine, Washington would certainly prefer to see a peaceful resolution
to the violence. For Moscow and Kiev, however, the matter is
existential, meaning each is willing to expend considerable capital and
take significant risks to resolve the conflict in their
favor.]{.underline} The 210 anti-tank missiles the State Department
authorized is enough to equip four or five mechanized or infantry
battalions for a short period of time. [These missiles could provide a
momentary tactical advantage, but strategically, the quantity is
insufficient to tilt the balance of power with Russia and its allied
forces.]{.underline} In the latter stages of the Cold War, I was an
officer in the 2nd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (2-2 ACR), a
heavily armored unit composed of large numbers of tanks and armored
infantry carriers. In 1991, 2-2 ACR was sent to Iraq to fight Saddam
Hussein's armored divisions, which had invaded Kuwait. At the Battle of
73 Easting, my squadron (a battalion-sized armored unit), fought against
a brigade of an Iraqi armored division. During that battle, three
cavalry troops of 2nd ACR---approximately the size of one mechanized
battalion---fired 125 tank rounds and eighty anti-tank missiles. In the
span of less than six hours, one battalion-sized unit fired the
equivalent of 38 percent of the entire missile sale to Ukraine. Thus, no
matter how it is billed in Washington, **[this sale will not "push back"
against Russian aggression]{.underline}**, nor is it in the "interests
of our nation." But [**while sending these missiles isn't enough to tip
the military balance in Ukraine, it is more than enough to convince
Russia to increase its involvement.** Those missiles represent a clear
increase in the risk to Russia and their proxy forces within eastern
Ukraine because it signals that Washington may be willing to provide
even greater lethal support to their opponent. It is therefore likely
Moscow will take stronger action to counter the threat to discourage
even greater American engagement.]{.underline} This support could take
the form of Putin sending more armor, anti-armor missiles of his own,
more unofficial Russian troops, greater intelligence support for allied
forces, or some other response that brings more violence and destruction
to the Donbas region---the people we're ostensibly trying to help. It is
reasonable and appropriate for the United States to promote the good of
others abroad and to champion our values as an exemplar, a shining city
on a hill. But we should only use, or threaten to use, military power
when American security, economic prosperity, or our way of life are
directly threatened. [Washington's intention with the missile sale may
be to increase the pain felt by Putin to drive him to a negotiated
settlement, but the actual result will almost certainly be a further
militarization of the situation and an increase in the potential for an
expansion of the conflict. Far from improving American security, this
sale will undermine it. Far from protecting Ukrainians, sending these
missiles will place them at increasing risk.]{.underline}

An Army major proposes in a recent paper that [the [Russian

a mostly conventional warfare campaign that also used social media to
recruit proxy troops, showcases how Russian units could defeat the U.S.
Army in [key eastern European
states](https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2018/03/08/top-general-says-balkans-not-baltics-the-most-vulnerable-to-russian-influence/).
Despite a drumbeat of worry about the [Russian New

or hybrid, warfare, the paper notes that conventional land combat, with
rockets, missiles, artillery, mechanized infantry and tanks, has
dominated the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Experts interviewed by
Military Times said that in a long, drawn-out conflict the United States
and NATO allies would likely win over Russia if there was a major land
grab on the eastern European border. But the fear is that Russian
[forces]{.underline} could move quickly and grab pieces of territory,
similar to what happened in Crimea and now in Ukraine. In that scenario
they [could entrench themselves deeply enough so that the slower
response from U.S. and NATO forces would arrive too late.]{.underline}
The paper, "Cyborgs at Little Stalingrad: A Brief History of [the
Battles of the Donetsk Airport,]{.underline}" was published this month
by The Institute of Land Warfare at the Association of [the U.S.
Army]{.underline}. The author, Maj. Amos C. Fox, is the operations
officer for the 1st Battalion, 35th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored
Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss, Texas[.
Positioning themselves in three "intermediate camps" in Russia but near
the Donbas region, an estimated 36,000 soldiers have participated in the
campaigns since they launched in 2014]{.underline}, Fox wrote. [The
first attack on the Donetsk Airport failed and Ukrainian military
forces, later nicknamed "cyborgs" for their fierce resistance, repelled
the separatists and Russians. But the Russians regrouped and flowed
thousands of soldiers into the region over the next weeks and months.
That ultimately led to a siege-like fight in which the Russians took
over the mostly destroyed airport and grabbed other
territory]{.underline}, which they continue to try to expand
incrementally. Those soldiers have rotated from as far as the eastern
edges of Russia near Japan. The Russian military has brought them in
groups of 600-800 troops, part of their battalion tactical groups, or
BTGs. And they are well-equipped. Fox cites unclassified reports showing
an estimated 200 tanks, 525 armored personnel carriers, 145 artillery
pieces and 83 multiple-launch rocket systems remain in the region to
support both Russian forces and separatist operations. Cyber operations,
including misinformation campaigns and social media recruiting were
factors in the fight and do open questions about what the Russian
military might be able to exploit in Belarus, Baltic States, the Balkans
and Moldova, given the ethnic ties those areas have to Russia. And it is
those rotations, combined with proxy recruiting and conventional warfare
that makes Fox worry that U.S. Army brigades just are not ready for that
type of threat. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of U.S.
Army Europe, wrote for the Center for European Policy Analysis that [the
major Russian exercise known as Zapad, conducted in 2017 near the Baltic
region, showcased how the Russian military has advanced its mobility.
"More concerning than actual firepower was Russia's logistical prowess
in terms of speed compared to NATO]{.underline}," Hodges wrote. "Russia
faces no international boundaries or customs procedures that could
inhibit movement in a crisis." Fox notes that Russian forces in this
ongoing campaign have fought "significant battles and waged decisive
sieges on a scale that vastly exceeds what the U.S. Army brigade combat
teams (BCTs) can experience at combat training centers." "These battles
are important because they remind students of war that rugged,
land-centric combined arms warfare has not been thrown into the dustbin
of history but is instead alive and well," Fox writes. And it goes
beyond the tactical small unit, troop level. The major points out that
the Russian generals and their support staff have gained command and
control, sustainment and other experience that's only marginally
replicable in Army training exercises. "The fact that [Russia has
rotated 27 brigades and regiments through the Donbas while the U.S. Army
possesses only 31 BCTs must not be overlooked]{.underline}," Fox wrote.
"The Russian military, especially its ground forces and its combat
experience, need to be respected." 2.6K

Ukraine [The ongoing civil war in Ukraine]{.underline} may not be
regularly grabbing global headlines, but it [was likely the one place
where U.S. and Russian troops are already technically fighting on
opposing fronts. The five-year conflict began amid a 2014 political
uprising in Kiev, where a leader sympathetic to Moscow was ousted in
favor of an oligarch supportive of fostering closer ties to Western
Europe. Pro-Russia hardliners in the east declared the succession of two
states with the alleged support of Russian troops, who were sent to
Ukraine\'s Crimean Peninsula, allegedly to protect the
majority-Russian-speaking community there. Within weeks, Crimea joined
Russia in a disputed referendum and war raged in the eastern provinces
of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as Donbass. The U.S. has
pledged its support for Ukraine]{.underline} in a conflict deemed
\"significant\" to Washington\'s interests by the Global Conflict
Tracker. [Despite continued casualties on both sides]{.underline} and a
flare-up involving Russia\'s seizure of Ukrainian navy vessels and crew

\"unchanging.\"]{.underline} **[A flare-up in Ukraine would likely pit
the U.S. against a foe it has accused of being supplied by

separatists with up to 680 tanks. **[The forces in charge of Donbass
have]{.underline}** not demonstrated any aerial or naval capabilities,
but they have [**been known to wield powerful anti-tank and anti-air
weaponry. Farley said that the risk of an inter-state conflict here

areas.]{.underline} Dialogue and cooperation started after the end of

(1994). [Relations were strengthened with the signing of the 1997

Commission (NUC) to take cooperation forward.]{.underline} The
Declaration of 2009 to Complement the NATO-Ukraine Charter mandated the
NUC, through Ukraine's Annual National Programme, to underpin Ukraine's
efforts to take forward reforms aimed at implementing Ukraine's
Euro-Atlantic aspirations Cooperation has deepened over time and is
mutually beneficial with Ukraine actively contributing to NATO-led
operations and missions. [Priority is given to support for comprehensive
reform in the security and defence sector]{.underline}, which is vital
for Ukraine's democratic development and for strengthening its ability
to defend itself. [In response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO has
reinforced its support for capability development and capacity-building
in Ukraine. The Allies continue to condemn Russia's illegal annexation
of Crimea, and its destabilising and aggressive activities in eastern
Ukraine and the Black Sea region. NATO has increased its presence in the
Black Sea and stepped up maritime cooperation with Ukraine and Georgia.
Since the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July 2016, NATO's practical support
for Ukraine has been subsumed in the Comprehensive Assistance Package
(CAP) for Ukraine. In June 2017, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted
legislation reinstating membership in NATO as a strategic foreign and

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization turned 70 years old Thursday. As
the the foreign ministers of its member nations gathered in Washington,
one their actions was to endorse a support package for Ukraine, now in
the fifth year of a war with Russia. Nick Schifrin sits down with Kurt
Volker, special envoy to Ukraine and former ambassador to NATO, to
discuss how best to engage with Russia. Full Transcript Judy Woodruff:
Today, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization turns 70 years old. In
Washington, [NATO\'s foreign ministers endorsed support for
Ukraine]{.underline}, the site of Europe\'s only active war. Here\'s
Nick Schifrin. Nick Schifrin: Seventy years ago today, the world\'s
longest-running military alliance was signed into existence, and
President Truman vowed NATO wouldn\'t be a threat to the Soviet Union.
Harry Truman: There are those who claim that this treaty is an
aggressive act on part of the nations which ring the North Atlantic.
That is absolutely untrue. Nick Schifrin: But, today, [as it did 70
years ago, NATO is taking steps opposed by]{.underline} what is now
[Russia.]{.underline} And nowhere is that more obvious than Ukraine, now
five years into a war between the Ukrainian military and Russia-backed
separatists. Late last year, Russian ships rammed Ukrainian ships in
waters both navies are legally allowed to use. And, [today, NATO
announced major steps to support Ukraine, including stepped-up presence
of NATO ships, surveillance of the Russian navy, and training of
Ukrainian troops. That is in addition to \$250 million of assistance in
the U.S. defense budget, including radar systems, refurbished Coast
Guard cutters, and tactical vehicles.]{.underline} And to talk about
this, I\'m joined [by Kurt Volker, former ambassador to NATO and now the
special representative for Ukraine.]{.underline} Welcome to the
\"NewsHour.\" Thank you so much. Kurt Volker: Thank you very much. Nick
Schifrin: Why is it in U.S. interests for NATO to support Ukraine, which
isn\'t, of course, a NATO member? Kurt Volker: Well, the first thing is
that [NATO is a defensive alliance protecting its members]{.underline},
as President Truman said. [And when you see that there is a conflict
going on in Europe, that a country\'s borders are being violated, that
is something that should be of concern to NATO. We want to see Europe
where everyone\'s sovereignty is respected, where people are secure
inside their own countries. Russian aggression against Ukraine is,
therefore, a threat to security in Europe as a whole.]{.underline} Nick
Schifrin: But NATO, as you know, has not been unified over Ukraine. You
have front-line states in the east who have wanted to be more aggressive
against Russia, states like Germany, France, U.K., and perhaps, to a
certain extent, the U.S., who wants to be a little more cautious. Is
NATO really doing enough to have an impact on Russia\'s behavior in
Eastern Ukraine? Kurt Volker: Well, two thoughts on that. First, I think
it\'s not quite fair to say that NATO has not been unified on Ukraine.
And, in fact, just this week, [the NATO foreign ministers approved the
Black Sea security approach for NATO]{.underline}, which is in part
about showing support for freedom of navigation security in the Black
Sea, and that bolsters Ukraine. There has been unified European Union
and U.S. sanctions on Russia because of their invasion of Ukraine. Some
countries, like the United States, have provided lethal defense
equipment. Some haven\'t, but there\'s generally a unified approach, and
then also to implement the Minsk agreements and restore Ukraine\'s
sovereignty and territorial integrity. So, NATO is pretty united on
that. Nick Schifrin: There is a flip side, of course, to this argument
that says the U.S. is --- and NATO is doing too much. And the question
is, why should the U.S. risk provoking Russia over Ukraine, again, a
non-NATO member, and Ukraine that, as President Obama put it, Russia
would always care about more than the U.S. would? Kurt Volker: Well, I
think what we care about is for people to be able to be free, to have
democracies, to be secure in their societies. And so the Russian bear
--- it\'s not a question of our poking the bear. The Russian bear has
taken a chunk out of Ukraine. And what we\'d like to see is, Ukraine be
able to get its territory back and to be able to be safe and secure
within its own borders. This is not a threat to Russia. It\'s not poke
to Russia. It\'s about Ukraine being a sovereign country that has a
right to its own security. Nick Schifrin: You have said yourself Ukraine
needs to get better in order to... Kurt Volker: Absolutely. Nick
Schifrin: ... to resist Russian interference, corruption, of course,
being the top of the list. You had a recent scandal where members of the
national security council were siphoning enough money that was supposed
to go to military equipment. Is Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor who
is now the front-runner in the presidential election this month, the
person around whom Ukraine can coalesce? Kurt Volker: So, what we have
now is an election in Ukraine similar to elections that we have seen in
France or with the case of Brexit or even in the United States. It\'s a
candidate who has established himself as against the establishment vs.
the incumbent president, who is saying that, you know, I have worked
hard, I have made a lot of accomplishments, we have more to do. And now
the Ukrainian public is faced with this choice. Do they want someone who
is just going against the establishment, promising massive reform? Or do
they want someone who maybe has been disappointing to them in some
respects, but has done more on reform than anyone else has in Ukraine
for the past 20 years and stood up to Putin? Nick Schifrin: You\'re
talking about the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko. Kurt Volker: The
incumbent president. So, they have got this choice in front of them. And
what\'s great about this is, this is a truly democratic election. We
don\'t know how this is going to come out. Nick Schifrin: Zelensky is a
total novice. What\'s to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from
testing him, or using this moment as a way to somehow change the status
quo? Kurt Volker: Well, I think we can assume, based on Russia\'s
behavior up to now, that they will continue to test whoever is the
president of Ukraine. They --- they have invaded. They have taken
territory. They keep the fighting going. You see all kinds of
propaganda, R.T., Sputnik, cyber-attacks. The whole --- the whole
toolbox is on display in Ukraine. Nick Schifrin: Are they manipulating
the election? Kurt Volker: They\'re trying to. And kind of, you know,
like in a lot of countries, the Russians are involved. But, at the same
time, it\'s very hard to mess with people\'s own sense of their own
interests. And I\'m not sure they had an impact in the first round. I\'m
not sure they will have an impact in the second round. Nick Schifrin:
Kurt Volker, former ambassador to NATO and current special
representative for Ukraine, thank you very much. Kurt Volker: Thank you
for having me. Judy Woodruff: And as part of our NATO anniversary
coverage, Nick Schifrin talked with the foreign ministers of former
adversaries Greece and North Macedonia for their first ever joint
interview.

### Internal Link -- Goes Nuclear

#### New US and Russian strategies means war would go nuclear

**[[Brumfiel 2-1-19]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Geoff Brumfiel; Geoff

[At a Russian base on the Baltic Sea, construction is underway to house
a new generation of nuclear-capable missiles. Tentlike structures have
popped up to shelter the mobile missile system, known as Iskander, which
is capable of firing weapons with both conventional and nuclear
warheads]{.underline}. Recent satellite imagery of the territory, known
as Kaliningrad, also shows that old buildings on the base are being
demolished. \"It really looks like the base is getting a pretty
comprehensive overhaul,\" says [Jeffrey
Lewis](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/people/jeffrey-lewis), a
scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey
who has been analyzing the satellite imagery taken by San
Francisco-based company [Planet](https://www.planet.com/). \"Right now,
it\'s just a big construction site.\" [Meanwhile, over 5,000 miles away
in the Texas Panhandle, production has begun on a new kind of American
nuclear weapon. Known as the
[W76-2](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/28/689510716/trump-administration-begins-production-of-a-new-nuclear-weapon),
it is a much smaller variant of an existing nuclear weapon. The Trump
administration says this new warhead will help counter Russia\'s
capabilities.]{.underline} Lewis and other experts say [these new
weapons have the potential to be used in the sort of nuclear war America
hasn\'t prepared for in years. Rather than a global conflagration, this
would be a tactical nuclear conflict, where weapons would be deployed on
the battlefield. \"I think there may be a renewed enthusiasm in both the
United States and Russia for new nuclear weapons in combat roles,\"
Lewis says.]{.underline} The idea of using small nuclear weapons in a
conflict took hold at the height of the Cold War. [In July
1962](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a128367.pdf), hundreds
of troops rehearsed an attack in the Nevada desert. But before they went
in, an armored personnel carrier fired a miniature nuclear weapon [known
as a Davy
Crockett](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a470429.pdf) at a
simulated enemy position. The weapon detonated with a tiny fraction of
the strength of a city-busting thermonuclear warhead. Within the hour,
U.S. troops and tanks crossed the blazing desert to declare a simulated
victory. Back then, that was how some imagined nuclear war would look:
little nukes used together with conventional weapons to overwhelm or
hold back an adversary. As the Cold War stretched on, the U.S. built
thousands of nuclear mines, missiles and artillery designed to be used
on the battlefield. But they eventually fell out of fashion. \"Over the
course of the 1980s, those weapons increasingly became seen as a
liability,\" Lewis says. Then, in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. \"At
the end of the Cold War, the United States said, \'That was kind of
stupid. Why do we have all this stuff? Let\'s get rid of it,\' \" says

Kroenig](https://twitter.com/kroenig?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor),
a nuclear policy expert at the Atlantic Council and an associate
professor at Georgetown University. The U.S. dismantled nearly all its
battlefield nuclear weapons. But Russia took a different path. It has
kept thousands of battlefield nukes. \"So today, Russia has nuclear land
mines, nuclear torpedoes, nuclear depth charges, nuclear artillery,
nuclear short-range missiles,\" Kroenig says. Russia\'s battlefield
nuclear weapons are widely believed to be held primarily in central
storage, far from any potential conflict. But the missiles that could
carry them are not. At bases like the one in Kaliningrad, Russia is
deploying missiles and making upgrades. The weapons, along with some
thinly veiled statements by senior Russian officials, are in part
designed to send a message, says [Olga
Oliker](https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/olga-oliker),
director for Europe and Central Asia at the International Crisis Group.
That message: \"Don\'t forget we have nuclear weapons. Don\'t forget we
could use them.\" Oliker believes Russia\'s talk around nuclear weapons
is mostly posturing. But the Trump administration says there are signs
that Russia may be tempted to actually use its tactical nukes. [The
administration\'s Nuclear Posture
Review](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF),
released last year, warned that [Russia might decide to fire off a
battlefield nuke early in a crisis. If that happened]{.underline},
Kroenig says, [the U.S. and its allies wouldn\'t be able to respond in
kind because the only nukes it has left are big weapons designed to
fight an apocalyptic kind of nuclear war.]{.underline} \"[We could back
down to avoid nuclear war, or we could retaliate with our large
strategic nuclear weapons, potentially risking a larger nuclear
attack]{.underline},\" Kroenig says. [That is the value of the new W76-2
being built by the administration, he argues: \"If you use a low-yield
nuclear weapon, we can respond with one, two or three of our
own.\"]{.underline} In addition, the Nuclear Posture Review calls for a
new nuclear sea-launched cruise missile. Kroenig says that is likely to
take around a decade to develop. [But]{.underline} there are others who
worry that these [new weapons could start the U.S. and Russia on a path
back to the dark days of the Cold War.]{.underline} [Hans
Kristensen](https://fas.org/expert/hans-kristensen/), director of the
Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists,
warns that these [less powerful weapons may make nuclear weapons seem
more usable to U.S. war planners.]{.underline} \"I think it\'s a waste
of money, and it\'s a dangerous kind of mission creep,\" he says.
Kristensen says [that the W76-2 in particular is a \"very unorthodox\"
kind of low-yield weapon]{.underline}. Although the government has
provided no official details about the warhead, Kristensen and others
believe it is built by retooling a much more powerful thermonuclear
weapon, known as the W76-1. [The W76-1 has a nuclear \"primary\"
component that detonates the much larger thermonuclear \"secondary\"
part of the weapon. By removing or disabling the big secondary while
leaving the small primary intact, Kristensen says, workers can
relatively quickly convert a large strategic weapon into a less powerful
battlefield device.]{.underline} But Lewis notes that this creates
another problem: Both versions of the W76 are launched on the same
ballistic missile. \"[All the Russians are going to see is that a
missile that only carries nuclear warheads is heading towards Russia,\"
Lewis says. \"Russian policy, as \[President\] Vladimir Putin has said
many times, is not to wait for it to land.\"]{.underline} Instead, Lewis
believes, the [Russians would most likely retaliate with powerful
long-range weapons]{.underline}. Kroenig disputes that. [If the U.S.
were to launch a weapon, he says, it would very likely be a single
missile in response to a Russian battlefield nuclear
weapon.]{.underline} The Russians are likely to recognize that, he
believes.

[Russia]{.underline} and China p[ossess nuclear weapons and the ability

untold damage. Most Americans probably haven't thought about this level

impact on trade far beyond what is currently being seen in the current

that it does. While DOD has taken some

### Impact -- Nuclear War

#### Overt US involvement in the Ukraine crisis leads to nuclear war

**[[Deutsch 15]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** -- former president of

Punch,

[The Ukraine/Russia conflict is particularly ominous because tensions
with the United States could escalate into a **nuclear
war**]{.underline}. For this reason, it is necessary to understand
NATO's role, patterns of U.S. domination and the nuclear arms race. [The
political world is dangerously in flux, with entangled military and
economic alliances and a robust weapons trade]{.underline}. [This is
similar to the prelude to World War I when it took **one trigger** to
unleash cascading inter-state violence]{.underline}. The demonization of
Russia and Putin leaves out the role of the United States and NATO.
Seumas Milne, writes in The Guardian, March 4, 2015, "A quarter of a
century after the end of the Cold War, the 'Russian threat' is
unmistakably back. Vladimir Putin, Britain's defence secretary Michael
Fallon declares, is as great a danger to Europe as 'Islamic State'...
"Putin's authoritarian conservatism may offer little for Russia's
future, but this anti-Russian incitement is dangerous folly. There
certainly has been military expansionism. But it has overwhelmingly come
from NATO, not Moscow." James Bissett is a former Canadian ambassador to
Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria. He wrote in the Ottawa Citizen last
year, "[The]{.underline} current [crisis in Ukraine]{.underline}
threatens global security and at worst [has the potential for nuclear
catastrophe.]{.underline} At best, it signals a continuation of the Cold
War. Sadly, the crisis is completely unnecessary and the responsibility
lies entirely in the hands of the United States-led NATO powers. The
almost virulent propaganda onslaught blaming Russia for the instability
and violence in Ukraine simply ignores reality and the facts." Stephen
Cohen, emeritus professor of Russian studies at Princeton University and
New York University says that simply blaming Vladimir Putin and Russia
for [the]{.underline} present [stand-off in relations means "no
negotiation" and]{.underline} that [no negotiation leads to
war]{.underline}. He told Democracy Now last year, "The false statement
\[Obama\] made, and the premise on which American policy is being made,
is that Putin attacked Ukraine and began this whole mess. Whatever you
think about what the outcome should be, that is just factually untrue.
All of this began when the United States and Europe asked Ukraine back
last November to make a decision between Russia and the European Union."

### Impact -- Nuclear Winter

#### US-Russia war leads to nuclear winter

**[[Fisher 15]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Max, "How World War III
became possible," Vox, June 29, 2015,

If you take a walk around Washington or a Western European capital
today, there is no feeling of looming catastrophe. The threats are too
complex, with many moving pieces and overlapping layers of risk adding
up to a larger danger that is less obvious. People can be forgiven for
not seeing the cloud hanging over them, for feeling that all is well ---
even as [in Eastern Europe they are digging in for war]{.underline}. But
this [complacency is itself part of the problem, making the threat
**more difficult to foresee, to manage, or**]{.underline}, potentially,
to **[avert.]{.underline}** There is [a growing chorus of political
analysts, arms control experts, and government officials]{.underline}
who [are sounding the alarm]{.underline}, trying to call the world\'s
attention to its drift toward disaster. [The prospect of]{.underline} a
major war, even a **[nuclear war]{.underline}**, in Europe [has become
thinkable]{.underline}, they warn, [even **plausible**. What they
describe is a threat that combines]{.underline} many of the
[hair-trigger]{.underline} dangers [and **world-ending** stakes of the
Cold War with the]{.underline} volatility and [false calm that preceded
World War I]{.underline} --- a comparison I heard with disturbing
frequency. They described a number of ways that an unwanted but
nonetheless major war, like that of 1914, could break out in the Eastern
European borderlands. [The stakes]{.underline}, they say, [could not be
higher]{.underline}: the post--World War II peace in Europe, the lives
of thousands or millions of Eastern Europeans, or even, in a worst-case
scenario that is remote but real, [the **nuclear devastation of the
planet**]{.underline}. I. The warnings: \"**[War is not something
that\'s impossible anymore\"]{.underline}** Everyone in Moscow tells you
that if you want to understand Russia\'s foreign policy and its view of
its place the world, the person you need to talk to is Fyodor Lukyanov.
Sober and bespectacled, with an academic\'s short brown beard, Lukyanov
speaks with the precision of a political scientist but the occasional
guardedness of someone with far greater access than your average
analyst. Widely considered both an influential leader and an unofficial
interpreter of Russia\'s foreign policy establishment,
[Lukyanov]{.underline} is [chief of Russia\'s most important foreign
policy think tank]{.underline} and its most important foreign policy
journal, both of which reflect the state and its worldview. He is known
to be close to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. I met Lukyanov
around the corner from the looming Foreign Ministry compound (his office
is nearby), at a small, bohemian cafe in Moscow that serves French and
Israeli food to a room packed with gray suits. He was candid and
relaxed. When the discussion turned to the risks of war, he grew dire.
\"The atmosphere is a feeling that war is not something that's
impossible anymore,\" Lukyanov told me, describing a growing concern
within Moscow\'s foreign policy elite. \"A question that was absolutely
impossible a couple of years ago, whether there might be a war, a real
war, is back,\" he said. \"People ask it.\" I asked how this had
happened. He said that regular Russian people don\'t desire war, but
rather feared it would become necessary to defend against the implacably
hostile United States. \"The perception is that somebody would try to
undermine Russia as a country that opposes the United States, and then
we will need to defend ourselves by military means,\" he explained. Such
fears, vague but existential, are everywhere in Moscow. Even liberal
opposition leaders I met with, pro-Western types who oppose Putin,
expressed fears that the US posed an imminent threat to Russia\'s
security. I had booked my trip to Moscow in December, hoping to get the
Russian perspective on what were, at the time, murmurings among a
handful of political and arms control analysts that conflict could come
to Europe. By the time I arrived in the city, in late April, concerns of
an unintended and potentially catastrophic war had grown unsettlingly
common. [Lukyanov]{.underline}, pointing to the US and Russian military
buildups along Eastern Europe, also [worried that an accident or
provocation could be misconstrued as a deliberate attack and lead to
war]{.underline}. In the Cold War, he pointed out, both sides had
understood this risk and installed political and physical infrastructure
--- [think of the]{.underline} \"emergency [red phone\" --- to manage
tensions]{.underline} and prevent them from spiraling out of control.
**[That infrastructure is now gone]{.underline}**. [\"All those
mechanisms were disrupted or eroded]{.underline},\" he said. \"That
\[infrastructure\] has been degraded since the end of the Cold War
because the common perception is that we don't need it anymore.\" That
the world does not see the risk of war hanging over it, in other words,
makes that risk all the likelier. For most Americans, such predictions
sound improbable, even silly. But [the dangers are growing every week,
as are the warnings]{.underline}. \"One can hear eerie echoes of the
events a century ago that produced the catastrophe known as World War
I,\" Harvard professor and longtime Pentagon adviser Graham Allison ---
one of the graybeards of American foreign policy --- wrote in a May
cover story for the National Interest, co-authored with Russia analyst
Dimitri Simes. Their article, \"Russia and America: Stumbling to War,\"
warned that an unwanted, full-scale conflict between the US and Russia
was increasingly plausible. In Washington, the threat feels remote. It
does not in Eastern Europe. [Baltic nations, fearing war, have already
begun preparing for it]{.underline}. So has Sweden: \"[We see Russian
intelligence operations in Sweden]{.underline} --- [we]{.underline}
can\'t [interpret this]{.underline} in any other way --- [as preparation
for military operations]{.underline} against Sweden,\" a Swedish
security official announced in March. In May, Finland\'s defense
ministry sent letters to 900,000 citizens --- one-sixth of the
population --- telling them to prepare for conscription in case of a
\"crisis situation.\" Lithuania has reinstituted military conscription.
Poland, in June, appointed a general who would take over as military
commander in case of war. Though Western publics remain blissfully
unaware, and Western leaders divided, many of the people tasked with
securing Europe are treating conflict as more likely. In late April,
NATO and other Western officials gathered in [Estonia,]{.underline} a
former Soviet republic and NATO member on Russia\'s border that Western
analysts most worry [could become **ground zero for a major war** with
Russia.]{.underline} At the conference, Deputy Secretary General
Alexander Vershbow spoke so openly about NATO\'s efforts to prepare for
the possibility of Russia launching a limited nuclear strike in Europe
that, according to the journalist Ahmed Rashid, who was in attendance,
he had to be repeatedly reminded he was speaking on the record. One of
the scenarios Vershbow said NATO was outlining, according to Rashid\'s
paraphrase, was that [Russia could \"choose to use a tactical
weapon]{.underline} with a small blast range [on a European city or a
Western tank division]{.underline}.\" A few weeks later, the Guardian
reported that NATO is considering plans to \"upgrade\" its nuclear
posture in Europe in response to Russia\'s own nuclear saber-rattling.
One proposal: for NATO\'s military exercises to include more nuclear
weapons use, something Russia already does frequently. II. The gamble:
Putin\'s plan to make Russia great again [Should]{.underline} the
warnings prove right, and [a major war break out in Europe between
Russia and the West,]{.underline} then the story of that war, if anyone
is still around to tell it, [will begin with]{.underline} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin trying to solve a problem]{.underline}. That
problem is this: Putin\'s [Russia is weak. It can no longer stand toe to
toe with the US]{.underline}. It no longer has Europe divided in a
stalemate; rather, it sees the continent as dominated by an
ever-encroaching anti-Russian alliance[. In the Russian view, the
country\'s weakness leaves it]{.underline} at imminent risk,
[vulnerable]{.underline} to a hostile West bent on subjugating or
outright destroying Russia as it did to Iraq and Libya. [This is made
more urgent for Putin by his political problems at hom]{.underline}e. In
2012, during his reelection, popular [protests and accusations of fraud
weakened his]{.underline} sense of political [legitimacy]{.underline}.
[The problem worsened with Russia\'s 2014 economic
collapse]{.underline}; Putin\'s implicit bargain with the Russian people
had been that he would deliver economic growth and they would let him
erode basic rights. Without the economy, what did he have to offer them?
[Putin\'s answer has been to assert Russian power beyond its actual
strength]{.underline} --- and, in the process, to recast himself as a
national hero guarding against foreign enemies. Without a
world-power-class military or economy at his disposal, he is instead
wielding confusion and uncertainty --- which Soviet leaders rightly
avoided as existential dangers --- as weapons against the West. [Unable
to overtly control Eastern Europe, he has fomented risks and
crises]{.underline} in there, sponsoring separatists in Ukraine and
[conducting dangerous military activity along NATO airspace and coastal
borders,]{.underline} giving Russia more leverage there. [Reasserting a
Russian sphere of influence over Eastern Europe, he]{.underline}
apparently [believes, will]{.underline} finally [give Russia
security]{.underline} from the hostile West --- and make Russia a great
power once more. Knowing his military is outmatched against the
Americans, [he is blurring the distinction between war and
peace,]{.underline} deploying tactics that exist in, and thus widen, the
gray between: militia violence, propaganda, cyberattacks, under a new
rubric the Russian military sometimes calls \"hybrid war.\" Unable to
cross America\'s red lines, Putin is doing his best to muddy them ---
and, to deter the Americans, muddying his own. Turning otherwise routine
diplomatic and military incidents into games of high-stakes chicken
favors Russia, he believes, as the West will ultimately yield to his
superior will. To solve the problem of Russia\'s conventional military
weakness, [he has dramatically lowered the threshold for when he would
use nuclear weapons, hoping to terrify the West such that it
will]{.underline} bend to [avoid conflict]{.underline}. In public
speeches, over and over, he references those weapons and his willingness
to use them. [He has enshrined, in Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine,
a dangerous idea]{.underline} no Soviet leader ever adopted:
[that]{.underline} a [nuclear war could be winnable]{.underline}. Putin,
having recast himself at home as a national hero standing up to foreign
enemies, is more popular than ever. Russia has once more become a shadow
hanging over Eastern Europe, feared and only rarely bowed to, but always
taken seriously. Many Western Europeans, asked in a poll whether they
would defend their own Eastern European allies from a Russian invasion,
said no. Russia\'s aggression, born of both a desire to reengineer a
European order that it views as hostile and a sense of existential
weakness that justifies drastic measures, makes it far more willing to
accept the dangers of war. As RAND\'s F. Stephen Larrabee wrote in one
of the increasingly urgent warnings that some analysts are issuing,
\"The Russia that the United States faces today is more assertive and
more unpredictable --- and thus, in many ways, more dangerous --- than
the Russia that the United States confronted during the latter part of
the Cold War.\" Joseph Nye, the dean of Harvard University\'s school of
government and one of America\'s most respected international relations
scholars, pointed out that Russia\'s weakness-masking aggression was yet
another disturbing parallel to the buildup to World War I. \"[Russia
seems doomed to continue its decline]{.underline} --- an outcome that
should be no cause for celebration in the West,\" [Nye
wrote]{.underline} in a recent column. \"[States in decline]{.underline}
--- think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 --- tend to [become
**less risk-averse** and thus **much more dangerous**]{.underline}.\"
III. The drift: How the unthinkable became possible The Cold War was a
dangerous game, but it was a game in which everyone knew and agreed upon
the stakes and the rules. That is not the case today. The Western side
believes it is playing a game where the rules are clear enough, the
stakes relatively modest, and the competition easily winnable. The
Russian side, however, sees a game where the rules can be rewritten on
the fly, even the definition of war itself altered. For Russia, fearing
a threat from the West it sees as imminent and existential, the stakes
are unimaginably high, justifying virtually any action or gamble if it
could deter defeat and, perhaps, lead to victory. Separately, the
ever-paranoid Kremlin believes that the West is playing the same game in
Ukraine. Western support for Ukraine\'s government and efforts to broker
a ceasefire to the war there, Moscow believes, are really a plot to
encircle Russia with hostile puppet states and to rob Russia of its
rightful sphere of influence. Repeated Russian warnings that it would go
to war to defend its perceived interests in Ukraine, potentially even
nuclear war, are dismissed in most Western capitals as bluffing, mere
rhetoric. Western leaders view these threats through Western eyes, in
which impoverished Ukraine would never be worth risking a major war. In
Russian eyes, Ukraine looks much more important: an extension of Russian
heritage that is sacrosanct and, as the final remaining component of the
empire, a strategic loss that would unacceptably weaken Russian strength
and thus Russian security. Both side are gambling and guessing in the
absence of a clear understanding of what the other side truly intends,
how it will act, what will and will not trigger the invisible triplines
that would send us careening into war. During the Cold War, the
comparably matched Western and Soviet blocs prepared for war but also
made sure that war never came. They locked Europe in a tense but stable
balance of power; that balance is gone. They set clear red lines and
vowed to defend them at all costs. Today, those red lines are murky and
ill-defined. Neither side is sure where they lie or what really happens
if they are crossed. No one can say for sure what would trigger war.
That is why, analysts will tell you[, today\'s tensions bear far more
similarity to the period before World War I: an unstable power balance,
belligerence over peripheral conflicts, entangling military commitments,
disputes over the future of the European order, and dangerous
uncertainty about what actions will and will not force the other party
into conflict]{.underline}. Today\'s Russia, once more the strongest
nation in Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, calls to
mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire, which Henry Kissinger
described as \"too big for Europe, but too small for the world.\" Now,
as then, a rising power, propelled by nationalism, is seeking to revise
the European order. Now, as then, it believes that through superior
cunning, and perhaps even by proving its might, it can force a larger
role for itself. Now, as then, the drift toward war is gradual and easy
to miss --- which is exactly what makes it so dangerous. But there is
one way in which today\'s dangers are less like those before World War
I, and more similar to those of the Cold War: the apocalyptic logic of
nuclear weapons. [Mutual suspicion, fear of an existential threat,
armies parked across borders from one another, and hair-trigger nuclear
weapons all make any small skirmish a potential
**armageddon**.]{.underline} In some ways, that logic has grown even
more dangerous. Russia, hoping to compensate for its conventional
military forces\' relative weakness, has dramatically relaxed its rules
for using nuclear weapons. Whereas [Soviet leaders saw their nuclear
weapons as pure deterrents]{.underline}, something that existed
precisely so they would never be used, [Putin\'s view appears to be
radically different]{.underline}. [Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine
calls on the country to launch a battlefield nuclear strike in case of a
conventional war that could pose an existential threat]{.underline}.
These are more than just words: Moscow has repeatedly signaled its
willingness and preparations to use nuclear weapons even in a more
limited war. [This is a terrifyingly low bar for nuclear weapons
use]{.underline}, particularly [given that any war would likely occur
along Russia\'s borders and thus not far from Moscow.]{.underline} And
it suggests [Putin has adopted an idea that]{.underline} Cold War
leaders considered unthinkable: that [a \"limited\" nuclear
war]{.underline}, of small warheads dropped on the battlefield, [could
be not only survivable but winnable.]{.underline} [\"It's not just a
difference in rhetoric. It's a whole different world]{.underline},\"
Bruce G. [Blair, a nuclear weapons scholar]{.underline} at Princeton,
[told the W]{.underline}all [S]{.underline}treet [Journal]{.underline}.
He called Putin\'s decisions more dangerous than those of any Soviet
leader since 1962. \"There's a low nuclear threshold now that didn't
exist during the Cold War.\" Nuclear theory is complex and disputable;
maybe Putin is right. But [many theorists]{.underline} would
[say]{.underline} he is wrong, that the logic of nuclear warfare means
[a \"limited\" nuclear strike is in fact likely to trigger a larger
nuclear war --- a **doomsday scenario** in which major American,
Russian, and European cities would be targets for attacks many times
more powerful than the bombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even
if a nuclear war did]{.underline} somehow [remain limited and contained,
**recent studies suggest** that environmental and atmospheric damage
would cause a \"**decade of winter**\" and mass crop die-outs that could
kill up to 1 billion people in a global famine]{.underline}. IV. **[How
it would happen]{.underline}**: The Baltics scenario In September of
last year, President Obama traveled to Estonia, a nation of 1.3 million
people that most Americans have never heard of, and pledged that the
United States would if necessary go to war with Russia to defend it.
[Estonia, along with Latvia and Lithuania]{.underline} --- [together
known as the Baltic states]{.underline} --- are at the far edge of
Eastern Europe, along Russia\'s border. They were formerly part of the
Soviet Union. And they [are where many Western analysts fear **World War
III is likeliest to start**]{.underline}. [These small countries are
\"the most likely front line of any future crisis,\" according
to]{.underline} Stephen [Saideman, an i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [professor]{.underline} at Carleton University.
[Allison and Simes,]{.underline} in their essay warning of war, [called
the Baltics \"the Achilles' heel of]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline}
alliance.\" A full quarter of Estonia\'s population is ethnically
Russian. Clustered on the border with Russia, this minority is served by
the same Russian state media that helped stir up separatist violence
among Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. But [unlike Ukraine, the
Baltic states are all members of NATO, whose charter states that an
attack on one member is an attack on them all]{.underline}. Whereas a
Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Western sanctions, [a Russian
invasion of Estonia would **legally obligate** the US and most of Europe
to declare war on Moscow]{.underline}.

regional nuclear war]{.underline} between India and Pakistan [in which

carbon]{.underline} (BC). [This would self-loft to the stratosphere,
where it would spread globally, producing a sudden drop in surface
temperatures and intense heating of the stratosphere. Using the
Community Earth System Model with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate
Model]{.underline}, we calculate an e-folding time of 8.7 years for
stratospheric BC compared to 4--6.5 years for previous studies. [Our
calculations show that global ozone losses of 20%--50% over populated
areas]{.underline}, levels unprecedented in human history, [would
accompany the coldest average surface temperatures in the last 1000
years. We calculate summer enhancements in UV indices of 30%--80% over
midlatitudes, suggesting widespread damage to human health, agriculture,
and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Killing frosts would reduce
growing seasons by 10--40 days per year for 5 years. Surface
temperatures would be reduced for more than 25 years due to thermal
inertia and albedo effects in the ocean and expanded sea ice. The
combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on
global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear
famine.]{.underline} Knowledge of the impacts of 100 small nuclear
weapons should motivate the elimination of more than 17,000 nuclear
weapons that exist today.

For nearly half a century, the world's most powerful nuclear-armed
countries have been locked in a military stalemate known as mutual
assured destruction (MAD). By the early 1960s, the United States and the
Soviet Union possessed such large, well dispersed nuclear arsenals that
neither state could entirely destroy the other's nuclear forces in a
first strike. Whether the scenario was a preemptive strike during a
crisis, or a bolt-from-the-blue surprise attack, the victim would always
be able to retaliate and destroy the aggressor. Nuclear war was
therefore tantamount to mutual suicide. [Many scholars believe that the
nuclear stalemate helped prevent conflict between the superpowers during
the Cold War, and that it remains a powerful force for great power peace
today]{.underline}.1 [The age of MAD, however, is waning. Today the
United States stands on the verge of attaining nuclear primacy vis-à-vis
its plausible great power adversaries. For the first time in decades, it
could conceivably disarm the long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia or
China with a nuclear first strike. A preemptive strike on an alerted
Russian arsenal would still likely fail, but a surprise attack at
peacetime alert levels would have a reasonable chance of
success]{.underline}. Furthermore, the Chinese nuclear force is so
vulnerable that it could be destroyed even if it were alerted during a
crisis. To the extent that great power peace stems from the pacifying
effects of nuclear weapons, it currently rests on a shaky foundation.
This article makes three empirical claims. First, [the strategic nuclear
balance has shifted dramatically since the end of the Cold War, and the
United States now stands on the cusp of nuclear primacy]{.underline}.2
Second, [the shift in the balance of power has two primary sources: the
decline of the Russian nuclear arsenal and the steady growth in U.S.
nuclear capabilities.]{.underline} Third, [the trajectory of nuclear
developments suggests that the nuclear balance will shift further in
favor of the United States in the coming years. Russia and China will
face tremendous incentives to reestablish mutual assured destruction,
but doing so will require substantial sums of money and years of
sustained effort]{.underline}. [If these states want to reestablish a
robust strategic deterrent, they will have to overcome current U.S.
capabilities, planned improvements to the U.S. arsenal, and future
developments being considered by the United States. U.S. nuclear primacy
may last a decade or more.]{.underline}

#### Deterrence theory has been empirically disproven

**[[Barash 18]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (David P. Barash, Professor of

peace studies, and the sexual behavior of animals and people. 01-09
-2018, \"Nuclear deterrence is more ideology than theory -- David P
Barash,\" Aeon,
https://aeon.co/essays/nuclear-deterrence-is-more-ideology-than-theory)

[What we can say is that, as of this morning, those with the power to
exterminate life have not done so. But this is not altogether
comforting, and history is no more reassuring.]{.underline} The duration
of 'nuclear peace', from the Second World War to the end of the Cold
War, lasted less than five decades. More than 20 years separated the
First and Second World Wars; before that, there had been more than 40
years of relative peace between the end of the Franco-Prussian War
(1871) and the First World War (1914), and 55 years between the
Franco-Prussian War and Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo (1815). Even in
war-prone Europe, decades of peace have not been so rare. [Each time,
when peace ended and the next war began, the war involved weapons
available at the time -- which, for the next big one, would likely
include nuclear weapons. The only way to make sure that nuclear weapons
are not used is to make sure that there are no such weapons. There is
certainly no reason to think that the presence of nuclear weapons will
prevent their use. The first step to ensuring that humans do not unleash
nuclear holocaust might be to show that the Emperor Deterrence has no
clothes -- which would then open the possibility of replacing the
illusion with something more suitable.]{.underline} It is possible that
the post-1945 US-Soviet peace came 'through strength', but that need not
imply nuclear deterrence. [It is]{.underline} also [undeniable that the
presence of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert capable of reaching
each other's homeland in minutes has made both sides edgy. The Cuban
Missile Crisis of 1962 -- when, by all accounts, the world came closer
to nuclear war than at any other time -- is not testimony to the
effectiveness of deterrence: the crisis occurred because of nuclear
weapons. It is more likely that we have been spared nuclear war not
because of deterrence but in spite of it. Even when possessed by just
one side, nuclear weapons have not deterred other forms of war. The
Chinese, Cuban, Iranian and Nicaraguan revolutions all took place even
though a nuclear-armed US backed the overthrown governments. Similarly,
the US lost the Vietnam War, just as the Soviet Union lost in
Afghanistan, despite both countries not only possessing nuclear weapons,
but also more and better conventional arms than their
adversaries.]{.underline} Nor did nuclear weapons aid Russia in its
unsuccessful war against Chechen rebels in 1994-96, or in 1999-2000,
when Russia's conventional weapons devastated the suffering Chechen
Republic. Nuclear weapons did not help the US achieve its goals in Iraq
or Afghanistan, which have become expensive catastrophic failures for
the country with the world's most advanced nuclear weapons. Moreover,
despite its nuclear arsenal, the US remains fearful of domestic
terrorist attacks, which are more likely to be made with nuclear weapons
than be deterred by them. [In short, it is not legitimate to argue that
nuclear weapons have deterred anysort of war, or that they will do so in
the future.]{.underline} During the Cold War, each side engaged in
conventional warfare: the Soviets, for example, in Hungary (1956),
Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1979-89); the Russians in
Chechnya (1994-96; 1999-2009), Georgia (2008), Ukraine (2014-present),
as well as Syria (2015-present); and the US in Korea (1950-53), Vietnam
(1955-75), Lebanon (1982), Grenada (1983), Panama (1989-90), the Persian
Gulf (1990-91), the former Yugoslavia (1991-99), Afghanistan
(2001-present), and Iraq (2003-present), to mention just a few cases.
[Nor have their weapons deterred attacks upon nuclear armed states by
non-nuclear opponents. In 1950, China stood 14 years from developing and
deploying its own nuclear weapons, whereas the US had a well-developed
atomic arsenal. Nonetheless, as the Korean War's tide was shifting
dramatically against the North, that US nuclear arsenal did not inhibit
China from sending more than 300,000 soldiers across the Yalu River,
resulting in the stalemate on the Korean peninsula that divides it to
this day, and has resulted in one of the world's most dangerous
unresolved stand-offs.]{.underline} In 1956, the nuclear-armed United
Kingdom warned non-nuclear Egypt to refrain from nationalising the Suez
Canal. To no avail: the UK, France and Israel ended up invading Sinai
with conventional forces. In 1982, Argentina attacked the British-held
Falkland Islands, even though the UK had nuclear weapons and Argentina
did not. Following the US-led invasion in 1991, conventionally armed
Iraq was not deterred from lobbing Scud missiles at nuclear-armed
Israel, which did not retaliate, although it could have used its nuclear
weapons to vaporise Baghdad. It is hard to imagine how doing so would
have benefitted anyone. Obviously, US nuclear weapons did not deter the
terrorist attacks on the US of 11 September 2001, just as the nuclear
arsenals of the UK and France have not prevented repeated terrorist
attacks on those countries. Nuclear weapons didn't escalate demands; if
anything, such countries were less successful in getting their way
[Deterrence, in short, does not deter.]{.underline} The pattern is deep
and geographically widespread. Nuclear-armed France couldn't prevail
over the non-nuclear Algerian National Liberation Front. [The US nuclear
arsenal didn't inhibit North Korea from seizing a US
intelligence-gathering vessel,]{.underline} the USS Pueblo, in 1968.
Even today, this boat remains in North Korean hands. US nukes didn't
enable China to get Vietnam to end its invasion of Cambodia in 1979. Nor
did US nuclear weapons stop Iranian Revolutionary Guards from capturing
US diplomats and holding them hostage (1979-81), just as fear of US
nuclear weapons didn't empower the US and its allies to force Iraq to
retreat from Kuwait without a fight in 1990.

#### Nuclear deterrence theory is flawed and leads to proliferation

**[[Troiani 13]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Brooks Troiani, went to
University of Texas for public policy analysis, 7-3-2013, \"Why Current
Deterrence Theory is Wrong,\" No Publication,
http://wagingpeacetoday.blogspot.com/2013/07/why-current-deterrence-theory-is-wrong.html)

[The main argument given against the idea of nuclear abolition is that
the]{.underline} "genie is out of the bottle," and the [only thing that
keeps more countries from getting nuclear weapons is threatening them
with nuclear weapons. However, Iran and North Korea stand as stark
evidence that this is simply not true. Nation-states will develop
nuclear weapons in response to being threatened by nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} In an age where the nuclear armed states can
invade any non-nuclear country without drastic consequences, threatened
states see that in this mindset, it only makes sense to arm oneself. The
US was able to invade Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. I would argue the
only reason why the US hasn't invaded Iran is because Russia and China
have threatened retaliation. Russia invaded Afghanistan in the 80s.
China took over Tibet. [The message the nuclear powers have been sending
the rest of the world over the last 50 years is that if you do something
we don't like, and you don't have a nuclear arsenal, then we can invade
you. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that in reality deterrence
leads to proliferation because it creates a mindset in which nuclear
weapons are the source of power and therefore necessary.]{.underline}
[This is disastrous in an age where terrorists are no longer bound by
national barriers. It is dangerous in a world that is currently fraught
with instability and popular unrest.]{.underline} Currently, President
Obama and President Putin have agreed to lower their arsenals by a third
more. While this looks like a step in the right direction, it is not
really progress. Let me tell you why. Both Russia and the US are
modernizing their nuclear arsenals. They are spending billions of
dollars on making the nuclear weapons more deadly (as if blowing up an
entire city-sized area isn't deadly enough), more difficult to shoot
down with missiles, and faster (missiles that can hit a target in 4
minutes rather than ten). So really while they lower the number of
overall warheads, all they are really doing is retiring the old warheads
and actually creating a new stockpile of deadlier ones. I must ask why
the US needs to spend billions of dollars on making the deadliest
weapons in human history deadlier. It is almost laughable. I mean how
accurate does a nuclear missile need to be? If you get within a mile of
your target you will still vaporize it. For example, the old WWII
nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are 80 times weaker than
our smallest nuclear warhead now. Our smallest nuclear warhead
completely annihilates a 1.7 mile radius around the detonation spot.
Most buildings and all living things in this area are wiped out
instantly. They get off lucky. Then within a 2.7 mile radius from the
blast (or 1 mile outside of the instant death area) all buildings except
for steel structure are gone, fifty percent of living things are
instantly killed, the other fifty percent is mortally burned or wounded
and will die within the coming minutes, hours, or days after the blast.
At a 4.7 mile radius from the blast center (or 2 miles outside of the
last damage radius), all houses are destroyed by the blast wave, an
estimated five percent of the population is instantly killed, forty-five
percent are injured, all have been exposed to toxic levels of radiation.
They will most likely die slowly and painfully of radiation poisoning.
At a 7.4 mile radius (or roughly 3 miles from the last damage radius)
there is still blast damage but only twenty-five percent of the
population is injured. After this point there is less damage from the
blast itself, however every living thing within thirty miles from the
blast center has been exposed to lethal doses of radiation. They will
die within days, and that area will be uninhabitable for ten years.
Within ninety miles, all living persons will die of radiation poisoning,
also within days. Within 160 miles, people will show symptoms of
radiation poisoning: hair loss, white blood loss, nerve damage. The
elderly, the young, and the sick will die. Finally within 250 miles from
the blast center, radiation poisoning will occur, though most will live.
Also, the land will be safe to inhabit within three years. This is the
effect of both the US and Russia's smallest nuclear warhead. In another
report, this time on a terrorist nuclear attack on New York City
estimates that there would be 800,000 people killed, and 900,000 people
injured. Those are the effects of the smallest warheads. If anything
bigger is used the results are dramatically worse. The fact remains if
ever a nuclear attack were to occur on any city the results would be
horrifying. While deterrence may have prevented a nuclear attack from
another country, no amount of nuclear weapons can prevent a terrorist
from acquiring a nuclear weapon. How do you prevent a terrorist from
getting a nuclear warhead? Well one way is to keep nuclear weapons in
secure facilities. However, countries like Pakistan and India have
questionable security, and the US can't regulate their security. Also,
in Pakistan's case, if government rule was to break down, nothing would
stop terrorist groups from gaining access to those weapons. However, if
the nuclear powers come to an agreement to set a date for virtual
disarmament, boost the power of the IAEA to regularly inspect and
regulate nuclear programs in all countries, and agree to support the
enforcement of the agreement through UN military force and sanctions
then the disarmament could be permanent. This is quite a lot to ask from
most of the nuclear powers. However, I believe that security from
nuclear attack should trump sovereignty in this instance. If there is no
enforcement, then there is no punishment for failing to make good on
disarmament. Once countries disarm, it would be very easy to make sure
no country starts arming again because creating weapon's grade plutonium
is a lengthy, expensive, and fairly obvious endeavor. Think about it; no
terrorist organization has been able to make one because doing so
requires building huge facilities and employing experts who are under
surveillance. Even North Korea, the most secretive country in the world,
didn't keep their nuclear weapons development a secret. As long as the
IAEA and various intelligence agencies do their jobs, no country could
get away with making a nuclear weapon. So why is it likely that this
idea won't come to fruition? First of all, the belief in nuclear
deterrence is accepted as fact by both parties in Washington and Moscow.
Second, there is still little trust for the Russians in Washington DC.
The good news is that Russia is not our enemy anymore, and this
mentality could be changed through effort. For some reason, many
politicians in America and Europe still see Russia as a country to fear
instead of work with. The truth is the moment America takes off its Cold
War goggles and views Russia in a new way is the moment in which nuclear
disarmament talks will actually bear fruit[. If the two countries with
the largest nuclear arsenals and worst nuclear track records start
transparently and honestly disarming, is when the rest of the world will
see that a commitment to a nuclear-free world is actually possible.
Current deterrence ideology has failed. However]{.underline}, I believe
that [if the world is transparently disarmed and then honestly
regulated, nuclear weapons development can be deterred.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear deterrence theory bad

**[[Kriege 11]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**(David Kriege, President of the
Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, author and editor of many books on peace
and nuclear weapons abolition 2-7-2011, \"Ten Serious Flaws in Nuclear
Deterrence Theory,\" Nuclear Age Peace Foundation,
https://www.wagingpeace.org/ten-serious-flaws-in-nuclear-deterrence-theory/)

As a former commander of the US Strategic Command, General George Lee
Butler was in charge of all US nuclear weapons. [After retiring from the
US Air Force, General Butler critiqued nuclear deterrence, stating that
it "suspended rational thinking in the Nuclear Age about the ultimate
aim of national security: to ensure the survival of the nation." He
concluded that nuclear deterrence is "a slippery intellectual construct
that translates very poorly into the real world of spontaneous crises,
inexplicable motivations, incomplete intelligence and fragile human
relationships."]{.underline} As volcanoes often give off strong warning
signals that they may erupt, so [we have witnessed]{.underline} such
signals regarding nuclear arsenals and the [failure of nuclear
deterrence theory over the course of the Nuclear Age]{.underline}.
Nuclear arsenals could erupt with volcano-like force, totally
overwhelming the relatively flimsy veneer of "protection" provided by
nuclear deterrence theory. In the face of such dangers, we must not be
complacent. [Nor should we continue to be soothed by the "experts" who
assure us not to worry because the weapons will keep us safe. There is,
in fact, much to worry about, much more than the nuclear policy makers
and theorists in each of the nuclear weapon states have led us to
believe.]{.underline} I will examine below what I believe are ten
serious flaws in nuclear deterrence theory, flaws that lead to the
conclusion [that the theory is unstable, unreliable and
invalid.]{.underline} [**1. It is only a theory.** It is not proven and
cannot be proven]{.underline}. A theory may posit a causal relationship,
for example, if one party does something, certain results will follow.
In the case of nuclear deterrence theory, it is posited that if one
party threatens to retaliate with nuclear weapons, the other side will
not attack. [That an attack has not occurred,]{.underline} however,
[does not prove that it was prevented by nuclear deterrence. That is, in
logic, a false assumption of causality. In logic, one cannot prove a
negative, that is, that doing something causes something else not to
happen. That a nuclear attack has not happened may be a result of any
number of other factors, or simply of exceptional good fortune. To
attribute the absence of nuclear war to nuclear deterrence is to
register a false positive, which imbues nuclear deterrence with a false
sense of efficacy. **2. It requires a commitment to mass
murder.**]{.underline} [Nuclear deterrence leads to policy debates about
how many threatened deaths with nuclear weapons are enough to deter an
adversary]{.underline}? Are one million deaths sufficient to deter
adversary A? Is it a different number for adversary B? How many deaths
are sufficient? One million? Ten million? One hundred million? More?
There will always be a tendency to err on the side of more deaths, and
thus the creation of more elaborate nuclear killing systems. [Such
calculations]{.underline}, in turn, [drive arms races, requiring huge
allocations of resources to weapons systems that must never be used.
Leaders must convince their own populations that the threat of mass
murder and the expenditure of resources to support this threat make them
secure and is preferable to other allocations of scientific and
financial resources. The result is not only a misallocation of
resources, but also a diversion of effort away from cooperative
solutions to global problems. **3. It requires effective
communications**]{.underline}. In effect, [nuclear deterrence is a
communications theory. Side A must communicate its capability and
willingness to use its nuclear arsenal in retaliation for an attack by
adversary B]{.underline}, thereby preventing adversary B from attacking.
The threat to retaliate and commit mass murder must be believable to a
potential attacker. Communications take place verbally in speeches by
leaders and parliamentary statements, as well as news reports and even
by rumors. Communications also take place non-verbally in the form of
alliance formations and nuclear weapons and missile tests. [In relation
to nuclear deterrence, virtually everything that each side does is a
deliberate or inadvertent form of communication to a potential
adversary. There is much room for error and
misunderstanding]{.underline}. **[4. It requires rational decision
makers.]{.underline}** [Nuclear deterrence will not be effective against
a decision maker who is irrational.]{.underline} For example, side A may
threaten nuclear retaliation for an attack by adversary B, but the
leader of side B may irrationally conclude that the leader of side A
will not do what he says. Or, the [leader of side B may irrationally
attack side A because he does not care if one million or ten million of
his countrymen die as a result of side A's nuclear
retaliation]{.underline}. I believe two very important questions to
consider are these: Do all leaders of all states behave rationally at
all times, particularly under conditions of extreme stress when tensions
are very high? Can we be assured that all leaders of all states will
behave rationally at all times in the future? Most people believe the
answer to these questions is an unqualified No. **[5. It instills a
false sense of confidence]{.underline}**. [Nuclear deterrence is
frequently confused with nuclear "defense," leading to the conclusion
that nuclear weapons provide some form of physical protection against
attack.]{.underline} This conclusion is simply wrong. The we[apons and
the threat of their use provide no physical protection. The only
protection provided is psychological and once the weapons start flying
it will become clear that psychological protection is not physical
protection.]{.underline} One can believe the weapons make him safer, but
this is not the same as actually being safer. [Because nuclear
deterrence theory provides a false sense of confidence, it could lead a
possessor of the weapons to take risks that would be avoided without
nuclear threats in place. Such risks could be counterproductive and
actually lead to nuclear war. 6. It does not work against an accidental
use]{.underline}. Nuclear deterrence is useful, if at all, only against
the possibility of an intentional, premeditated nuclear attack. Its
purpose is to make the leader who contemplates the intentional use of a
nuclear weapon decide against doing so. But nuclear deterrence cannot
prevent an accidental use of a nuclear weapon, such as an accidental
launch. This point was made in the movie Dr. Strangelove, in which a US
nuclear attack was accidentally set in motion against the Soviet Union.
In the movie, bomber crews passed their "failsafe" point in a training
exercise and couldn't be recalled. The president of the United States
had to get on the phone with his Soviet counterpart and try to explain
that the attack on Moscow that had been set in motion was just an
accident. The Americans were helpless to stop the accident from
occurring, and so were the Soviets. Accidents happen! There is no such
thing as a "foolproof" system, and when nuclear weapons are involved it
is extremely dangerous to think there is. [7. It doesn't work against
terrorist organizations**.**]{.underline} Nuclear deterrence is based
upon the threat of retaliation. Since it is not possible to retaliate
against a foe that you cannot locate, the threat of retaliation is not
credible under these circumstances. Further, terrorists are often
suicidal (e.g., "suicide bombers"), and are willing to die to inflict
death and suffering on an adversary. For these reasons, nuclear
deterrence will be ineffective in preventing nuclear terrorism. The only
way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to prevent the weapons themselves
from falling into the hands of terrorist organizations. This will become
increasingly difficult if nuclear weapons and the nuclear materials to
build them proliferate to more and more countries. **[8. It encourages
nuclear proliferation.]{.underline}** To the extent that the theory of
nuclear deterrence is accepted as valid and its flaws overlooked or
ignored, it will make nuclear weapons seem to be valuable instruments
for the protection of a country. Thus, [the uncritical acceptance of
nuclear deterrence theory provides an incentive for nuclear
proliferation. If it is believed that nuclear weapons can keep a country
safe, there will be commensurate pressure to develop such weapons. **9.
It is not believable.**]{.underline} In the final analysis, [it is
likely that even the policy makers who promote nuclear deterrence do not
truly believe in it. If policy makers did truly believe that nuclear
deterrence works as they claim, they would not need to develop missile
defenses]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[alone has spent over \$100 billion on developing missile defenses over
the past three decades]{.underline}, and is continuing to spend some
\$10 billion annually on missile defense systems[. Such
attempts]{.underline} at physical protection against nuclear attacks are
unlikely to ever be fully successful, but they [demonstrate the
underlying understanding of policy makers that nuclear deterrence alone
is insufficient to provide protection to a country.]{.underline} If
policy makers understand that nuclear deterrence is far from foolproof,
then who is being fooled by nuclear deterrence theory? In all
likelihood, [the only people being fooled by the promised effectiveness
of nuclear deterrence theory are the ordinary people who place their
faith in their leaders]{.underline}, the same people who are the targets
of nuclear weapons and will suffer the consequences should nuclear
deterrence fail. Their political and military leaders have made them the
"fools" in what is far from a "foolproof" system. **[10. Its failure
would be catastrophic]{.underline}**. [Nuclear deterrence theory
requires the development and deployment of nuclear weapons for the
threat of retaliation. These weapons can, of course, be used for
initiating attacks as well as for seeking to prevent attacks by means of
threatened retaliation]{.underline}. [Should deterrence theory fail,
such failure could result in consequences beyond our greatest
fear]{.underline}s. For example, scientists have found in simulations of
the use of 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear weapons in an exchange between
India and Pakistan, the deaths could reach one billion individuals due
to blast, fire, radiation, climate change, crop failures and resulting
starvation. A larger nuclear war between the US and Russia could destroy
civilization as we know it. The flaws in [nuclear deterrence
theory]{.underline} that I have discussed cannot be waved aside. They
show that the theory [has inherent weaknesses that cannot be
overcome.]{.underline} Over time, the theory will suffer more and more
stress fractures and, like a poorly constructed bridge, it will fail.
Rather than staying docilely on the sidelines, citizens of the nuclear
weapon states must enter the arena of debate. In fact, they must create
the debate by challenging the efficacy and validity of nuclear
deterrence theory.

[While the competing nation states find other ways to wound their
geopolitical opponents, deterrence theory may]{.underline} also [not
work if one of the players is not rational or will pursue goals that
benefit from widespread destruction]{.underline} - for example, ISIS may
use any nuclear weapon it gets a hold of to cause maximum damage and
havoc. In a 2010 film ["Nuclear Tipping
Point,"](http://www.nucleartippingpoint.org/) the legendary former
secretary of state Henry Kissinger pointed out the limitations of
deterrence in a world of suicide bombers: "The classical notion of
deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors
and evildoers would recoil. In a world of suicide bombers, that
calculation doesn\'t operate in any comparable way," said Kissinger.
[There have]{.underline} also [been questions raised about the mental
stability of]{.underline} both Kim Jong-un, the [North
Korean](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/is-donald-trump-as-sane-as-kim-jong-un)
dictator and [President [Donald
Trump]{.underline}.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/health/mental-health-association-debate-trump/index.html)
[If people pushing the buttons are not acting rationally, deterrence may
also not work.]{.underline} Notably, the U.S. National Security Advisor
H.R. McMaster has publicly doubted whether classical deterrence would
have influence with Kim Jong Un because of the perceived irrationality
of the regime. "[The classical deterrence theory, how does that apply to
a regime like the regime in North Korea?" said McMaster in [an
appearance on "This Week" on ABC
News.](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-13-17-lt-gen-mcmaster-anthony/story?id=49177024)
"A regime that engages in unspeakable brutality against its own people?
A regime that poses a continuous threat to the its neighbors in the
region and now may pose a threat, direct threat, to the United States
with weapons of mass destruction? A regime that imprisons and murders
anyone who seems to oppose that regime, including members of his own
family, using sarin nerve gase (sic) \-- gas in a public
airport?"]{.underline} [Author and President of a conservative think
tank](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/) Clifford May, writing in the

relatively immune to the doctrine of MAD. "During the Cold War we relied

in their silos, [wrote

Is that doctrine adequate to constrain Kim Jong-un, a dictator whose
grasp on rationality is difficult to gauge? What happens if Iran's next
supreme leader believes that to bring about the return of the 12th Imam,
the Shia messiah, requires an apocalypse? Bernard Lewis, the esteemed
scholar of Islam, famously said that for those who hold such beliefs ---
former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was among them --- \'MAD is
not a deterrent, but an inducement.\'\" [He sees extreme sanctions and
non-nuclear military options as being necessary to influence the
behavior of such recalcitrant adversaries. Another big risk to the

South Korea get them? And if Iran gets them, wouldn't Saudi Arabia
follow suit? With a greater number of players, the risks of
miscalculations and conflicts of interests grow substantially. The only
way forward, to create a world that cannot be immediately annihilated
based on the insecurities and whims of its leaders, is to push for

#### New technology means nuke war is likely and MAD is no longer true

**[[The Economist 2018]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**(The Economist,
01-25-2018, \",\"
<https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/01/25/why-nuclear-stability-is-under-threat>)

[So far, the best argument for nuclear weapons has been that the fear of
mutually assured destruction]{.underline} (MAD) [has deterred states
that possess them from going to war with each other.]{.underline} MAD
rests on the principle of a secure second-strike capability, which means
that even if one side is subjected to the most wide-ranging first strike
conceivable, it will still have more than enough nuclear weapons left to
destroy the aggressor. When warheads became accurate enough to
obliterate most of an adversary's missiles in their silos, America and
Russia turned to submarines and mobile launchers to keep MAD viable. A
more dangerous world It still is, and is likely to remain so for some
time. [But disruptive new technologies, worsening relations between
Russia and America and a less cautious Russian leadership than in the
cold war have raised fears that a new era of strategic instability may
be approaching]{.underline}. James Miller, who was under-secretary of
defence for policy at the Pentagon until 2014, thinks that [the
deployment of increasingly advanced cyber, space, missile-defence,
long-range conventional strike and autonomous systems "has the potential
to threaten both sides' nuclear retaliatory strike capabilities,
particularly their command-and-control apparatuses", and that "the
potential of a dispute leading to a crisis, of a crisis leading to a
war, and of a war escalating rapidly" is growing. In a new report, Mr
Miller and Richard Fontaine]{.underline}, the president of the Centre
for a New American Security (CNAS), [identify cyber and
counter-space]{.underline} (eg, satellite jammers, lasers and high-power
microwave-gun systems) [attacks as possible triggers for an unplanned
conflict. Other new weapons may threaten either side's capability for
nuclear retaliation]{.underline}, particularly their strategic
command-and-control centres. James Acton, a nuclear-policy expert at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, lists [three
trends]{.underline} that [could undermine stability in a future crisis:
advanced technology that can threaten the survivability of nuclear
attacks; command-and-control systems that are used for both nuclear and
conventional weapons, leaving room for confusion; and an increased risk
of cyber attacks on such systems because of digitisation. Both America
and Russia rely heavily on digital networks and space-based systems for
command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance]{.underline} (C3ISR) to run almost every aspect of their
respective military enterprises. [Cyber space and outer space therefore
offer attackers tempting targets in the very early stages of a
conflict.]{.underline} In the utmost secrecy, [both sides have invested
heavily in offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}. In 2013 the
Defence Science Board advised the Pentagon that: "The benefits to an
attacker using cyber exploits are potentially spectacular. [Should the
United States find itself in a full-scale conflict with a peer
adversary, attacks would be expected to include denial of service, data
corruption, supply-chain corruption, traitorous insiders, kinetic and
related non-kinetic attacks at all altitudes from under water to space.
US guns, missiles and bombs may not fire, or may be directed against our
own troops. Resupply, including food, water, ammunition and fuel, may
not arrive when or where needed. Military commanders may rapidly lose
trust in the information and ability to control US systems and forces."
One problem with this is that the space architecture on which America
depends for its nuclear command and control, including missile early
warning, is also used for conventional warfare. That means a
conventional attack might be mistaken for a pre-emptive nuclear strike,
which could lead to rapid escalation. Another difficulty is that an
aggressor may be tempted to go after cyber and space assets in the hope
of causing major damage to a target's defences without actually killing
anybody. That would raise doubts over whether nuclear retaliation could
be justified. A third worry is that because of the potential speed and
surprise of such attacks, some responses might be delegated to
autonomous systems that can react in milliseconds. Lastly, there is the
possibility of "false flag" cyber operation by a rogue state or
non-state hacker group.]{.underline}

Sergey Lavrov said, according to state-media outlet TASS, referring to

#### Russia will not escalate with Ukraine now

**[[Khodarenok 7-3]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Mikhail Khodarenok,
military commentator, retired colonel, served as an officer at the main
operational directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed
Forces., 7-3-2019, \"Is Russia-Ukraine war possible?,\"
https://www.rt.com/op-ed/449130-russia-ukraine-war-possible/)

[When assessing the probability of a conflict between]{.underline} the
two countries, both [Russian and Ukrainian]{.underline} [military
officials and analysts]{.underline} usually start by breaking down the
balance of forces, the capabilities of both sides, the proficiency of
their respective troops, and the tactical and technical characteristics
of their weapons. What they [tend to overlook]{.underline}, however, is
[military-political aspects, as well as strategic and tactical
components. Not to mention, some of the assessments and predictions are
alarmist in nature, filled with blatant fear mongering.]{.underline} For
example, you are sure to come across headlines such as \'The probability
of full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine is estimated at 99%\',
\'Conflict is inevitable, as the West is preparing Ukraine for war with
Russia\', \'Ukraine is planning a large-scale invasion of Russia with
the goal of seizing its southern regions and taking back Crimea\',
\'NATO troops will operate under the Ukrainian flag, posing as
Ukraine\'s army\', and similar kind of drivel and plain fabrication.
[The authors of such publications never bother to point out the possible
military and political goals of the two potential warring parties.
Neither do they tell whether Russia or Ukraine are actually capable of
achieving said goals. Moreover, hardly ever do you see them spending a
line or two sketching out a possible post-war settlement or explaining
what the new balance of power will be like once the hostilities are
over.]{.underline} Yet this should be the foundation of your analysis:
you start by formulating -- very clearly and in great detail -- the
military and political goals of any potential war. In fact, this task is
to be done by the political leaders -- and not so much by the top
military officials. The resulting document should be a short (no more
than a page long) text containing four to five items: for example, what
military-political, territorial and economic demands are to be made
against Moscow (Kiev), how they will be resolved in the course of the
upcoming armed conflict and, finally, how the Ukrainian (Russian)
politicians and military officials see the resulting post-war landscape.
Without having first identified these goals, one would simply waste time
trying to assess the ratio of troops or tactical and technical features
of individual weapons or pieces of military equipment -- yet this is
exactly what the military analysts on both sides have been doing lately.
At times, they go so far as to analyze the combat capabilities of
individual regiments and even squadrons: say, the 3rd Squadron of the
39th Aviation Regiment of the 27th Mixed Aviation Division of the 4th
Air and Air Defence Forces Army of the Russian Armed Forces. In other
words, they attempt to predict in detail the forthcoming hostilities
between subunits or even individual units. It is worth noting that, in
terms of delineating any specific military-political goals of the
potential conflict, nothing has been done so far by the Ukrainian side.
In fact, nothing of the sort has even been attempted. Nor is there any
decently made military-political analysis of the components to a
hypothetical armed conflict prepared by Kiev. The military and political
leadership of Ukraine never actually went beyond continuous accusations
about Russia\'s alleged aggression. Apparently, [there are reasons why
it still has not crossed this line. First, precisely formulated and put
on paper, any military-political goals involving a large-scale armed
conflict with Russia would look like, to put it bluntly, delusional.
Could you seriously say things it would have to contain, out loud: \"As
part of a short military campaign, defeat the main forces of the Russian
Army deployed at the state border of Ukraine; assault and capture the
city of Moscow and St. Petersburg; proceed to the Ural Mountains and the
adjacent areas of Western Siberia and force the opposing side to sign a
peace treaty on conditions favorable to Ukraine.\" This looks so
unrealistic that it\'s hard to believe the Ukrainian military
are]{.underline} even discussing it, let alone [making some real
plans]{.underline} on paper. [Second, even if the Ukrainian military
were to get such an order, they would have to face the fact that they
have no resources or capabilities to implement it,]{.underline} and
that\'s something they won\'t have for quite a while. As of today, the
Armed Forces of Ukraine have very modest, to say the least, Navy and Air
Force. Let\'s be honest, even the country\'s ground forces are not much
of a force. To win a war against a supreme military power, one needs to
deliver a preemptive decisive blow of the kind the enemy cannot recover
from. With the military capacities Ukraine has now it\'s simply
impossible. It\'s only fair to assume the Ukrainian military know this
just as well, which is why it appears highly unlikely they would be
considering starting a war against Russia. [The idea of Russia invading
Ukraine is just as unrealistic, first and foremost for one good reason,
or rather the absence of any good reason, whether military or political,
to do so. While Russia does have the military capabilities to crush the
Ukrainian Army, it\'s completely unclear why that would be necessary or
what the plan could be for post-war Ukraine in such a case. The
international community is also not very supportive of Russia, to say
the least. Deemed by many world powers to be no less than \'a force of
evil\', Moscow would need to feel really politically suicidal to begin a
military campaign against Ukraine. There\'s yet another important lesson
history teaches us: states going through a serious economic crisis are
very unlikely to engage in a war, let alone start it. It\'s no secret to
anyone that neither of these two economies under discussion is exactly
booming. A full-scale war would add such a financial burden to their
budgets that might simply devastate them.]{.underline} Thus, the only
place a war between Moscow and Kiev may exist is the narrative created
by the relevant expert communities. Former Deputy Chief of the General
Staff of the Ukrainian Army Lieutenant General Igor Romanenko\'s
statements on the subject appear to be quite realistic. Among other
things, he did say that the conflict in the Sea of Azov might lead
Ukraine to a \"big war\" with Russia. He also gave a very sensible
assessment of the scope of military help Ukraine would get from the West
in such a case -- he said there would be none. Lieutenant General did
not talk about what military or political objectives a full-scale war
between Ukraine and Russia might actually pursue, though, so that
remains a mystery. [To sum it all up, it seems quite fair to say that a
large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine is highly unlikely in the
foreseeable future, and all we might continue to see is a series of
small incidents in the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, which will be
most likely resolved peacefully by way of negotiation.]{.underline}

[If Russia had invaded, you wouldn't have to ask; if you have to ask, it
hasn't.]{.underline} It would have happened quickly and be plain for all
to see. A thousand soldiers, a dozen or two tanks is not how it would
have happened: it would have been big, [it would have been sudden and it
would have been over quickly.]{.underline} There would be no need for
grainy satellite photos of combine harvesters or whatever they were; no
need for reporters who forgot their cell phones saying they saw
something: there would be Russian soldiers at the Dnepr certainly and
maybe in Kiev or Lviv; Russian soldiers, guns, helicopters, tanks and
aircraft all over the place. (Interesting to speculate, as it gets
colder and armed thugs throw their weight around, how Russian troops
would be received in Kiev today, isn't it? But we'll probably never
know). [Or at least the first part would have been over
quickly]{.underline}. Just like the US invasion of Iraq. [Getting to the
Dnepr, Kiev or Lviv would have been easy, but once there, the Russians
would have found themselves surrounded by people who didn't want them to
be there.]{.underline} And that, as the Americans found out in Iraq, is
quite a different thing. [If one were to take a horizontal slice of
Ukraine from east to west and ask the inhabitants to rate the presence
of Russian soldiers in their neighbourhood from one to ten, one would
get an answer ranging from ten in the far east to minus ten in the far
west: flowers in the east, bullets in the west. Russian troops in the
centre and west would find themselves opposed by people who had had
military training in the Soviet or Ukrainian Armed Forces, many of whom
had military experience in Afghanistan. In other words, Russian invaders
would be met with exactly the same response that western Ukrainian
invaders found in the east. Crimea was different: there it was all
flowers, all the way and the borders are clear, distinct and obvious.
Not at all the same in the rest of Ukraine.]{.underline} (2017: And the
Russian troops were already there, a point that Western accounts usually
glide over.) Yes, the Russian Army could get to the western border in a
week or two without much difficulty but it wouldn't be able to stay
there. So [that's why Moscow hasn't and won't "invade Ukraine": it
doesn't want to find itself bogged down in months or years of ambushes,
IEDs and all that.]{.underline} And then probably have to leave at the
end, anyway. Moscow has watched the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, of
course, it remembers its own experience in Afghanistan. [Huge cost for a
trivial and momentary gain.]{.underline} [The same reason]{.underline},
come to think of it, [why Moscow, with its alleged desire to rebuild the
empire or whatever, didn't put Georgia into the bag in 2008. And why it
won't invade Estonia either. It could do it, but it wouldn't be worth
it.]{.underline}

http://www.unz.com/tsaker/why-russia-wont-invade-the-ukraine-the-baltic-statelets-or-anybody-else/)

The AngloZionist [propaganda]{.underline} machine [is constantly warning
us that Russia is about to invade]{.underline} some country. The list of
candidates for invasion is long and ranges from Norway to the
[Ukraine]{.underline} and includes the Baltic statelets, Poland and even
countries further West. Of course, we are also told that NATO and the US
are here to prevent that. Well, thank God for them, right? But [what
is]{.underline} conspicuously [missing from this narrative is a
discussion of the possible Russian motives for such a military
move.]{.underline} Typically, we are merely told that Russia has broken
the European post-Cold War order and borders by "annexing" Crimea and by
sending military forces into the Donbass. Anybody with an IQ at room
temperature or above by now realizes that both of these claims are total
bunk. The ones who indeed broke the post-Cold War international order
and borders were the NATO member states when they used military force,
in complete illegality, to break-up Yugoslavia. As for the people of
Crimea, they had the opportunity to vote about their future in a
referendum, very much unlike the inhabitants of Kosovo which had no such
opportunity. As for the 08.08.08 war, even the Europeans who eventually,
and very reluctantly, agreed that it was, in fact, Saakashvili who
started this conflict, not Russia. But let's set all this aside and
assume that the Russian leaders would not hesitate to use military force
again if it was to their advantage. Let's assume that, yes, the Russians
are up to no good and that they might well try to bite-off some other
piece of land somewhere in Europe. Such an assumption would immediately
raise a crucial question: why would the Russians want to do that? For
some reason, this question is rarely, if ever, asked. Oh sure, we are
told that "Putin wants to rebuild the Soviet Union" or some other type
of empire but, again, nobody seems to wonder why he would want that! So
[let's look at possible rationales for such an attack]{.underline}:
[Reason number one: to gain more land That is probably the least
credible reason of all. [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)
is a vast country]{.underline} (17,098,246 km2) [with a relatively small
population]{.underline} (144,526,636) resulting in a very low population
density. Not only is Russia huge, but her territory has immense natural
resources. [The very last thing Russia needs is more land. Reason number
two: to increase the Russian population]{.underline} Well, yes, Russia
has a population deficit for sure. But that does [not]{.underline} mean
that [just any population increase would be a bonanza for
Russia]{.underline}. For example, [Russia will only be in a worse shape
if the number of people depending on unemployment, social services or
pensions increases. Likewise, Russia would not benefit from a
politically hostile population]{.underline}. So while Russia could
benefit from having a larger population, what she needs is more young
and well-educated \*Russians\*, not unemployed and destitute Ukrainians
or Lithuanians! [The massive influx of Ukrainian refugees, by the way,
has already contributed to an increase in qualified specialists,
including medical doctors and highly qualified engineers from the
Ukrainian military-industrial specialists who, when they saw their
bureaus and industries collapse in the Ukraine, moved to Russia to
continue to work. There is no need for the Russia to invade anybody to
get those highly qualified specliasts. As for Ukrainians without special
qualifications, they have already shown up in Russia, and the last thing
Russia needs is more of them]{.underline} (they can go scrub toilets in
Poland or the UK). Furthermore, there are already a lot of immigrants
from other parts of the world in Russia and getting more of them is
hardly a good idea. So while Russia would benefit from more qualified
young Russians, invading other countries is not the way to get them.
[Reason number three: geostrategic reasons]{.underline} What about the
Baltic ports? [What about the Ukrainian gas pipelines? The truth is that
in the Soviet times the Baltic ports or the Ukrainian pipelines were
crucial strategic assets. But since their independence, these countries
have not only ruined themselves and destroyed the infrastructure they
inherited from the "Soviet occupiers," but Russia has also successfully
replaced the infrastructure and industries she lost after
1991]{.underline}. Thus, for example, Russia has actively developed her
own commercial ports on the Baltic Sea, and they have now outgrown the
ones found in the Baltic states (see
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ports_of_the_Baltic_Sea)for a good
comparative chart). As [for the Ukrainian pipelines, not only are they
in terrible shape, Russia has successfully built "North" and "South"
streams which allow her to completely bypass the Ukraine and the need to
deal with the crazy Banderite junta in Kiev.]{.underline} The simple
truth is that while the Baltic statelets or the Ukronazis can fancy
themselves as a very precious prize, Russia has absolutely no need for
them whatsoever. In fact, the opposite is true: right now, [Russia can
barely finance all the reconstruction programs which are so urgently
needed after decades of nationalist rule in Crimea. In the future,
Russia will also have to help the Donbass rebuild.]{.underline} Does
anybody seriously believe that the Russians can afford to rescue even
more countries or territories?! [Reason number four: revanchist
motives]{.underline} That is the Hillary Clinton/Zbigniew Brzezinski
argument: the Russians are inherently expansionists, imperialists,
militarists, and revanchists and they don't need a motive to invade
somebody: that's simply what they do -- invade, terrorize, oppress.
Well, a quick objective look at history would prove that it is the West
which has always displayed such behavior, not Russia, but we can even
ignore that fact. [The truth is that while there are a lot of people in
Russia who have good memories of their lives in the Soviet Union, there
is just no constituency pushing for the re-birth of the Soviet Union or
for any kind of imperialism. If anything, most Russians are much more
isolationist, and they don't want to get involved in wars or the
invasion of foreign countries. This is not only a result of memories of
wars in Afghanistan or interventions in Germany, Hungary or
Czechoslovakia, but also the bitter realization that even the so-called
"Orthodox brothers"]{.underline} (some of whom even owe the existence of
their country on a world map to Russia!) [have now fully turned against
Russia and have become willing NATO-colonies]{.underline} (think
Bulgaria or Romania here). Yes, Putin did say that the collapse of the
Soviet Union was a tragedy (objectively, it was, and it brought immense
suffering to millions of people), but that does not at all mean that
Putin, or anybody else, actually wants to "resurrect" the Soviet Union,
even if it was feasible (which it is not). If anything, it was the US,
NATO, and the EU which, for purely ideological reasons chose to expand
their influence to the East and which are now constantly engaged in a
nonstop campaign of russophobia (phobia in both meanings of "fear" and
"hatred"). [Yes, Russians are disgusted with the West, but that hardly
means that they want to invade it. Reason number five: megalomania Well,
maybe the Russians are mad that they lost the Cold War and now want to
become a superpower again? In fact, no.]{.underline} Not at all. [Not
only do Russians not feel that they "lost" the Cold War, they even feel
that they are already a superpower: one which successfully defies the
Empire and which continues to struggle for full
sovereignization]{.underline} at a time when all European countries are
competing with each other for the title of most subservient lackey of
the Empire. Just like the USSR after WWII, Russia, after the nightmare
of the 1990s, has very successfully rebuilt, in spite of the constant
subversion and sabotage of the "united West" which tried every dirty
trick in the book to prevent Russia from recovering from the horrors
which the western-backed (and, really, run) "liberal democracy" imposed
upon her during the Eltsin years. Sure, [Russians want their country to
be prosperous and powerful, but that does not mean that they want to
become a US-like world hegemon which gets involved in every conflict on
the planet.]{.underline} Truth be told, even the bad old USSR was not
anti-US and never had the kind of global ambition the US has (well,
except for Trotsky, but Stalin gave the boot to those crazies, many of
whom later emigrated to the US and re-branded themselves as Neocons). Of
course, there is the eternal Russian "court jester," aka "Zhirik" aka
Vladimir Zhironovskii. He has made all sorts of threats (including
nuclear ones) against various countries neighboring Russia, but
everybody knows that he is just that, a court jester and that what he
says is basically utter nonsense. [Reason number six: to save Putin's
"regime."]{.underline} It is true that unpopular regimes use war to
distract from their failures and to make the population switch off their
brains for the sake of "circling the wagons" and being "patriotic." That
is most definitely what Poroshenko is doing right now. But [Putin has no
such need]{.underline}! [Even if the pension reform did cost him quite a
bit in terms of popularity, he is still far more popular at
home]{.underline} (and even internationally!) [than any political leader
in the West and [the Russian economy is doing just
fine](http://thesaker.is/russian-economic-resilience/)]{.underline}, in
spite of the famous sanctions. True, the mostly Atlantic Integrationist
Medvedev government is not very popular, but those officials (like
Shoigu or Lavrov) who are typically associated with Putin and his
Eurasian Sovereignists remain very popular. [The simple truth is that
Putin has no need for any "distracting crises" because he remains
remarkably popular in spite of all the difficulties Russia is currently
facing]{.underline}. If anything, it is the Trumps, Macrons, Mays, and
Co. who need a distracting war, not Putin! I could go on listing more
nonsensical pseudo-reasons for why Russia would want to occupy some
piece of land somewhere, each more far-fetched and baseless than the
previous one, but you get the point: [Russia has no interest whatsoever
in military interventions.]{.underline} In fact, what Russia needs more
than anything else is peace for as long as possible.

entering Ukraine's airspace. Ukrainian leaders have warned that border
crossings by any soldiers would be considered an invasion, even while
the country pursues military operations against a pro-Russian rebellion
in the east.]{.underline} Washington and Moscow hurl ever more heated
pronouncements. The first casualties lie in fresh graves. No less an
authority than Gen. Philip M. Breedlove of the United States Air Force,
NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, has said Russia could overrun
eastern Ukraine in three to five days. In other words, Russia could
basically achieve its goal of creating a neutral, weak Ukraine almost
instantly. [But will it?]{.underline} At first glance, the Russian
president, Vladimir V. Putin, seems to have strong reasons to dispatch
his tanks: shaping the Ukraine he wants well before elections scheduled
for May 25 put a new, legitimate government in place; reclaiming an area
that was historically part of Russia; gaining direct access to natural
resources and factories that have been crucial to Moscow's
military-industrial complex since Soviet times. And his land grab of
Crimea in March made him wildly popular at home. Yet [the reasons for
Mr. Putin to refrain from further military adventurism make a longer,
more tangled list: the cost of a huge occupation force and the
responsibility for the welfare of millions more people; the effect of
new, more severe Western sanctions on an already weak economy; the
possibility of significant Russian casualties caused by an insurgency in
eastern Ukraine; a new, implacably anti-Russian western section of
Ukraine; and likely pariah status internationally. On balance, the
negatives would seem to outweigh the positives, analysts
said.]{.underline} "[Military intervention from Putin's point of view is
Plan B," Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor and expert on
Russia's security forces currently doing research here, said recently.
"It is not off the table, but it is not the ideal outcome." Mr. Putin
would rather feed the insurrection from afar, analysts said, never quite
allowing the calm that would give Ukraine the opening needed to join the
European Union, or worse, NATO]{.underline}. It is a tactic Russia has
used successfully in previous attempts by former Soviet republics to
shift westward. However, any conversation or briefing paper about
Russia's next moves begins with a broad caveat. Few expected that Mr.
Putin would seize Crimea in a matter of weeks. "Nobody, including Putin,
knows what he may do next as the situation changes," the Royal United
Services Institute, a military and security research organization in
London, said in an analysis this month. There are signs that Russia
seems poised to invade. On Thursday, Ukraine started tentative armed
operations to dislodge pro-Russian militants from government buildings
in 10 eastern towns. Russia countered with extensive military maneuvers
along the frontier, including what the Pentagon said were half a dozen
violations of Ukrainian airspace in 24 hours. Russia denied that. Mr.
Putin used historical arguments to claim Crimea. He recently inaugurated
a similar discourse on southeastern Ukraine, noting that huge parts of
it were called Novorossiya, or New Russia, when first captured in
czarist times. The rights of ethnic Russians still living there need to
be protected, he said. Significant Russian military assets, including
intercontinental ballistic missiles, Navy ship gears, and jet and
helicopter engines, are produced in eastern Ukraine. Vladislav Zubok, a
Russian Cold War expert teaching at the London School of Economics who
has been researching the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, said senior
Soviet officials were panicked at the prospect of losing both Crimea and
Ukraine's industrial heartland. So the current crisis has deep roots.
But nothing is that straightforward. Perhaps a more significant
precedent, Professor Zubok said, are the high-profile military
maneuvers, without an invasion, long recommended by the K.G.B. to
destabilize restive neighbors. Russia deployed that tactic in Berlin in
1958, and in Poland during the 1980-81 Solidarity uprisings, for
example. If Moscow is following that strategy now, no invasion is
imminent, he said. [The main factor arguing against invasion is the risk
to Russia's prosperity, which Mr. Putin restored]{.underline}. ["Putin
will have to explain why he is risking war and sanctions and how he will
improve the lot of seven million people there," Professor Zubok said.
"How to do that and still maintain the standard of living of all
Russians? He would really be saying: 'Guys, it is all for the Russian
motherland now. It is time to tighten your belts.' " The economic
fallout from Crimea has already shoved Russia toward recession, with
capital flight and skittish foreign investors.]{.underline} Russia's
credit rating was cut Friday by Standard & Poor's to just one notch
above "junk" status, pushing up the cost of much-needed loans abroad.
[Mr. Putin and his closest advisers and allies have brushed off the
Western travel and banking sanctions imposed on them after the seizing
of Crimea. But the threat of a major economic blockade, sanctions
against entire sectors of the economy that would probably be set off by
a Ukraine invasion, are another matter.]{.underline} "The scenario is
like what happened to Iran," said Igor Korotchenko, a member of a
civilian board that advises the Russian military and the editor in chief
of National Defense Magazine. "The Russian Federation is not interested
in bringing troops into eastern Ukraine." [European firms seek to
minimize Russia
sanctions](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/26/european-firms-seek-to-minimize-russia-sanctions.html)
[Beyond economics, the specter of Slavs killing Slavs would soon sour
the Russian public on any invasion. Although the Ukrainian Army is weak,
it numbers 70,000, and the country has a history of partisans' attacking
invaders.]{.underline} Mr. Korotchenko said Russians would probably
embrace military intervention only if the army was dispatched as a
peacekeeping force should the Ukrainian military cause mass casualties.
[And the locals could also prove hostile. In eastern Ukraine, regional
polls have found that at most one-third of the population, depending on
the city, supports joining Russia.]{.underline} In Crimea, Russian
soldiers were greeted warmly, and needed to hold only the Isthmus of
Perekop, three miles wide, to sever Crimea from Ukraine. In eastern
Ukraine, if the 40,000 Russian troops now estimated to be camped along
the border crossed over, they would probably be attacked. [Russia would
also be responsible for a flood of refugees.]{.underline} "You cannot
occupy this region only with these small green men," said Alexander M.
Golts, an independent Russian military analyst, referring to the
anonymous soldiers in Crimea whom Mr. Putin later admitted were elite
Russian soldiers. "So you beat those poor Ukrainians. What then? [You
will have to establish a new border. You will not need 40,000 troops,
you will need 140,000]{.underline}."

### A2: Russia Is An Offensive Realist

#### Russia is a defensive realist

**[[Tsygankov 2018]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Andrei P. Tsygankov;

Starting with the first case of the Russian-Georgian war, [Emmanuel
Karagiannis]{.underline} (2013) [sees US-Russian competition both in its
global context, as well as in the South Caucasus specifically, as the
main cause of the 2008 Russian-Georgian war]{.underline} and, thereby,
explicitly applies John Mearsheimer's offensive realism. [The US is
presented as an offshore balancer in the South Caucasus with energy
interests in the region and with the geopolitical goal of preventing
Russia from becoming a regional hegemon]{.underline}. Thus, [US policy
is understood as the main driving factor behind Russian assertiveness
and militarization of its foreign policy. He shows that Russia responded
to Georgia's military operation in South Ossetia in a well-calculated
manner, using this opportunity to re-establish its hegemony without,
however, going so far as to occupy other territories,]{.underline}
because of the costs (especially the deterioration of relations with the
West) being too high and the benefits being too dubious. As Karagiannis
(2013) concludes, [Russia needed to fight this war against a weak
opponent]{.underline} (Georgia), [in order to defend its regional
position as well as to survive in the anarchical international
system]{.underline}. [Hans Mouritzen and Anders Wivel]{.underline}
(2012) also examine the Russian-Georgian war through a more complex --
what can be classified as NCR -- perspective. They explore the reactions
of different actors -- Russia, Georgia, the US, the EU, countries in
Russia's 'near abroad', and China. In each case, they start their
examination with an analysis of the systemic/structural conditions, then
move onto the level of interstate relations (geopolitics) if
explanations at the previous level are not satisfactory and, if still
necessary, go onto the intrastate (socio-psychological factors and
decision-making dynamics) level. As a result, they assess which level of
analysis has a greater explanatory power in each of the cases. [After
having examined about forty cases]{.underline}, they [come to the
conclusion that, in the case of Russia, the purely systemic perspective
works best, and other factors have played a minor role. Thus, for them,
it is sufficient to use a systemic/ structural perspective to understand
the main driving factors behind Russia's policy]{.underline} (which is
not true for other cases) -- [most importantly, the growing US influence
and Georgia's closer relations with NATO. As in the case of the
Russian-Georgian war]{.underline}, John Mearsheimer (2016, 2014b)
himself but also other [leading realists]{.underline} (Walt, 2015;
Schweller, 2017) [explain Russia's recent Ukraine policy, especially its
annexation of the Crimea and the ongoing destabilization strategies in
the East, as a defensive reaction to the West's policies. For them,
Russia's current assertive policy -- in Ukraine, Georgia, or Syria -- is
logical and predictable,]{.underline} if long-term patterns of
Russian-Western relations are considered. Mearsheimer, in particular,
criticizes the policies of NATO enlargement, EU expansion, and democracy
promotion. Mearsheimer and other realists remind us of the fact that,
from the start, [realists opposed NATO's policy of 'expansion' as a
mistake]{.underline} (Mearsheimer, 2014b, 6--7; Walt, 2016; Schweller,
2017) [and predicted that Russia would counteract at some
point]{.underline}. As Mearsheimer (in McFaul et al., 2014: 177)
summarizes: [When the United States and its allies take note of Moscow's
concerns . . . crises are averted and Russia cooperates on matters of
mutual concern. When the West ignores Moscow's interests . . .
confrontation reigns.]{.underline} Thus, realists argue in favour of a
so-called 'Russia first' approach, in which the US has more interest in
maintaining positive relations with Russia rather than supporting its
smaller neighbours with pro-Western aspirations. Stephen M. Walt
explains that [Putin is not interested 'in trying to reincorporate all
of Ukraine . . . and the "frozen conflict" that now exists there is
sufficient to achieve his core goal'. Both in Ukraine as well as Syria,
Putin pursues goals 'equally simple, realistic, and aligned with
Russia's limited means']{.underline} (Walt, 2016). According to him,
[Putin]{.underline}'s: \[f\]ailing is that it's all short-term . . . he
[is fighting a series of rearguard actions designed to prevent Russia's
global position from deteriorating further, instead of pursuing a
program that might enhance Russia's power and status over the longer
term.]{.underline} (Walt, 2016)

[It is also imperative to acknowledge the likelihood of American-made
weapons systems winding up in the hands other than those for whom they
were intended. Time and again, U.S.-supplied weapons are either stolen
from the anticipated beneficiary or never make it there in the first
place. In just the last decade, this happened in Libya, Syria, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, and Mexico]{.underline}.\[21\] [In Ukraine,
the worry would be that the Javelins provided by America could make
their way into the arms of either some sort of extremist Ukrainian
militia]{.underline} such as the Azov Battalion [or the very same
Russian-backed separatists the weapons were meant to
combat]{.underline}.\[22\] [The Ukrainian Army has lost control of
countless weapons that have then found their way onto the streets and
online marketplaces]{.underline}.\[23\] In [one instance, Ukrainian Army
vehicles were taken by separatists in broad daylight and subsequently
paraded about]{.underline}.\[24\] [More importantly, non-lethal U.S.
military equipment, such as mortar-tracking radar technology given to
Ukraine in 2015, was stolen by the separatists not long after
delivery]{.underline}.\[25\] [Assuming such a risk with lethal weaponry
is needless and should, under present circumstances, be
avoided.]{.underline}

And [there's an added concern that the Javelins could **fall into enemy
hands**.]{.underline} Current reports state they are to remain in
central Ukraine, under the watchful eyes of U.S. trainers. Even if they
were to be deployed to stop any Russian breakout, [it's questionable
they could be deployed fast enough or in great enough numbers to change
the tide of the conflict. Not to mention that the current conflict is
largely fought with artiller]{.underline}y.

[Some 300 pieces small arms, almost 1,500 pieces of light weapons, more
than 140,000 pieces ammunition and over 200 kg explosives were seized by
the Moldovan and Ukrainian law enforcement agencies during a Joint
Operation (JO) codenamed "ORION", coordinated by the European Union
Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) in cooperation
with the European Law Enforcement Agency (Europol).]{.underline}
Moreover, public awareness campaigns on voluntarily handing over the
illegally possessed firearms, without facing any criminal liability,
were organized during the JO "ORION" and proved to be also successful
as [2,027 light weapons, 54 small arms and 2,025 ammunitions with
different calibres, as well as 67 pneumatic and gas pistols were
voluntary handed over by Moldovan and Ukrainian citizens.]{.underline}
The JO "ORION" was carried in three operational phases, from September

EUROPOL, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Member States' common
efforts undertaken to tackle the threats related to cross-border crime
in the region and it contributed to improving the situational picture in
illegal weapons trafficking. The final results of Joint Operation

### IL---Misused 

#### Javelin Missiles are empirically mishandled---we are lucky we have not yet lost them in Ukraine

JEJP

[A cache of powerful American missiles sold to France has ended up in
the hands of rebel fighters loyal to Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who is seeking
to overthrow the UN-backed government in Tripoli.**The four Javelin
anti-tank missiles**, which cost more than US\$170,000 each, are usually
sold only to close U.S. allies.]{.underline} [They were recovered on
June 26 by Libyan government forces during a raid on a rebel
camp]{.underline} in Gheryan, a town in the mountains south of Tripoli.
Gheryan was the headquarters for Haftar's forces as they massed for an
assault on Tripoli in an attempt to overthrow the U.N.-backed
government[. France said on Wednesday that **the anti-tank missiles were
never intended for sale or transfer to any party to Libya's conflict**,
which would violate the sales agreement with the United States as well
as a U.N. arms embargo.]{.underline} [The Army Ministry said **the
missiles were intended for the "self-protection of a French military
unit** deployed to carry out intelligence and counter-terrorism
operations."]{.underline} "Damaged and unusable, the armaments were
being temporarily stocked at a depot ahead of their destruction," the
ministry said in a statement. It is the first time since 2016 that
France has publicly acknowledged it still has special forces deployed in
Libya. It is not clear how many troops are deployed. France broadly
supports Haftar, regarding his forces as helpful in the fight against
Islamist militants. "France has long supported all established forces
engaged in the fight against terrorism, in Libya, in the Tripoli area
and in Cyrenaica (the east of the country), as well as more broadly in
the Sahel," it said. ["It has never been a question of selling,
yielding, loaning or transferring these munitions to anybody in
Libya."]{.underline}

### Civil War Impact---Uniqueness

#### Civil War possible now---creates a self-fulfilling nuclear prophecy

Jamie **[[Seidel 19]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, \"Proof US is headed

https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/the-second-us-civil-war/news-story/ec43b36de5f5f9f11e478a8fc71ea2dc,

The scenario is scarily believable: It's November 2020. President Trump
has just lost the election. He blames voter fraud. He blames 'deep
state' interference. He blames illegal immigrants. He refuses to step
down. Riots and demonstrations erupt across the divided United States
... [FAR fetched? The sabre-rattling is getting louder. Governors.
Judges. Preachers. Politicians. All are ramping-up the rhetoric, pushing
the deep political divide within the United States towards a second
Civil War.]{.underline} Social scientists put aged, white male
evangelical populations in one corner. The other holds young, highly
educated women of colour. In between are countless pockets of outraged
interest groups, all fixated on their own fears. ["Almost every cultural
and social institution --- universities, the public schools, the NFL,
the Oscars, the Tonys, the Grammys, late-night television, public
restaurants, coffee shops, movies, TV, stand-up comedy --- has been not
just politicised but also weaponised," warns Hoover Institution
historian Dr Victor Hanson. "(The US stands) at the brink of a veritable
civil war".]{.underline} THE FOREVER WAR The first US Civil War began in
April 1861. The cultural divide behind this clash never went away. It
was a fight over slavery. But it was also a fight over religious and
political divides. It's a fight still being fought out in social media,
in rallies and in political conventions. Here's one example, from many.
Former US marine and now talk-show host Jesse Kelley has stated: "It's
time for the United States to divorce before things get dangerous".
"There is simply no common ground with the Left anymore," he writes. "We
are now the couple screaming at each other all night, every night as the
kids hide in their room ... "It does not have to be this way. There is a
difficult, but ultimately peaceful path that ends with everyone getting
most of what they want. We divide the nation in two." [It's a view
getting some serious attention: Governors, Senators, Representatives,
Preachers \... all are making similar calls. South Carolina members of
parliament have proposed a bill giving that state the power to
secede.]{.underline} But isn't it all just a storm in a teacup?
Political wannabes playing to their individual 'teams'? Vocal minorities
drowning out the silent masses? [Dr Hanson again has his fears: "zealous
and sometimes warring tiny minorities can escalate tensions, nullify
opposition, and bully the silenced majority to sanction --- or at least
not object to --- violence."]{.underline} But Dr Hanson's Hoover
Institution colleague, political scientist Professor Morris Fiorina, is
not so worried. "I am happy to report that the available data provide
grounds for feeling much more sanguine about the state of our country,"
Professor Fiorina writes. "Although they are noisy and harmful to our
politics, the kinds of people Hanson criticises are many fewer in number
than generally believed. They are what political scientists call the
political class, a small minority of self-appointed activists,
demonstrators, donors, partisan media commentators and office-seekers.
Given that such people are the public face of politics, many Americans
understandably take them as representative, but they are statistically
abnormal --- what we call "outliers." But such anger-fuelled rhetoric is
not unique to the United States. Extremism is also on the rise in
Europe, the United Kingdom --- and Australia. What makes the US
different is the terrifying amount of weaponry in the hands of its
citizens ANGRY PEOPLE The social cauldron is continuously being stirred.
Facts are manipulated. Those holding differences of opinion are labelled
'mortal enemies'. It's an environment inflaming threats and fear.
[Politicians seeking to grab attention through quick one-liners are no
help. California Democrat Eric Swalwell responded to threats of civil
war over his hopes to run for the 2020 presidency on a gun-control
platform. He said it would be a "short war" because "the government has
nukes". The idea of using nuclear weapons against one's own citizens,
needless to say, did not go down well.]{.underline} And it would be a
short war my friend. The government has nukes. Too many of them. But
they're legit. I'm sure if we talked we could find common ground to
protect our families and communities. --- Rep. Eric Swalwell
(@RepSwalwell) 16 November 2018 President Donald Trump has also made his
mark: he made a seemingly half-serious quip about becoming "president
for life". "(Xi Jinping was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe
we'll give that a shot some day". In the context of his daily social
media outbursts, this now seems all too feasible to many. Any negative
polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.
Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. --- Donald J.
Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 6 February 2017 [These are clear examples of
the extreme, polarising language that has become commonplace in daily
political discourse. And beneath it all boils widespread discontent over
economic circumstances, political and religious ideology --- and the
pace of change.]{.underline} Could [desensitisation to such outrageous
statements produce a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}? ["Our
society, like all previous complex societies, is on a rollercoaster,"
University of Connecticut Professor Peter Turchin recently wrote.
"Impersonal social forces bring us to the top; then comes the inevitable
plunge]{.underline}. But the descent is not inevitable. Ours is the
first society that can perceive how those forces operate, even if dimly.
This means that we can avoid the worst --- perhaps by switching to a
less harrowing track, perhaps by redesigning the rollercoaster
altogether." RISING VIOLENCE [The number of terror attacks in the United
States has been steadily growing. But very few of them are from Islamic
extremists.]{.underline} Instead, those collared for crimes such as
October's pipe-bomb attacks and the synagogue mass-shooting in
Pittsburgh belong to the far right. "Of particular concern are white
supremacists and anti-government extremists, such as militia groups and
so-called sovereign citizens interested in plotting attacks against
government, racial, religious, and political targets in the United
States," writes Center for Strategic & International Studies think-tank
researcher Dr Seth Jones. "Although violent left-wing groups and
individuals also present a threat, far-right-networks appear to be
better armed and larger." The same people who did the phony election
polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are
rigged just like before. --- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January
17, 2017 And driving this violence are issues such as changing ethnic
demographics, falling religious influence, practices such as abortion
--- and the power of centralised government. Left-wing extremists are
equally determined to enforce their view of the world. This includes the
rejection of capitalism, imperialism and colonialism as well as a focus
on environmental crises and socialist beliefs. But these extremists do
not correspond to US political parties, Dr Jones says: "Opinion polls in
the United States show that most Republicans and Democrats loathe
terrorism." Such extremism, however, is nothing new to the US. "After
the Civil War, President Ulysses S. Grant conducted an aggressive ---
and ultimately successful --- campaign against the Ku Klux Klan and its
offshoots ... from the 1860s to the 1870s," Dr Jones writes. "Grant
deployed federal soldiers to arrest Klan members ... Yet far-right
extremism persists. "The challenge now is to devote sufficient attention
and resources to stop the further rise of right-wing extremism." And
that extremism is finding a full voice. You are witnessing the single
greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad
and conflicted people! #MAGA --- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 15
June 2017 In April, popular political commentator Sean Hannity declared
that if President Trump was impeached ... "there's going to be two sides
... fighting and dividing this country at a level we've never seen" ---
those that stand for truth and those that literally buy into the corrupt
deep state attacks against a duly elected president". Trump campaigner
Roger Stone has said impeachment would produce "an insurrection like
you've never seen," and that any politician speaking out against the
president "would be endangering their own life". A second civil war?
GOING MAINSTREAM Social and conventional media is helping extremists get
together, organise events, and find common ground. And that commonality
is reinforcing efforts to broaden extremist movements, such as Nazi
'skinheads', into the 'mainstream'. "Many of these right-wing extremists
are trying to be less visible and less conspicuous. The goal is to avoid
the classic skinhead appearance of shaved heads, steel-toe combat boots,
and other apparel that might be obvious to law enforcement," Dr Jones
says. "White supremacist Ben Daley instructed his supporters to wear
clothing like polo-style shirts and khakis, as well as to get clean-cut
military haircuts." Daley's thinking, as outlined in his social media
posts, represents the new approach: "Ultimately the 80s in that style of
nationalism proved to be ineffective ... (I) think its time to reimagine
the nationalist look and playbook, we have become predictable that needs
to change." At least in pockets of the United States, this new tactic
appears to be having some effect. And it's that regionality that has Dr
Hanson concerned. "Left --- Right factionalism is increasingly fuelled
by geography --- always history's force multiplier of civil strife," he
writes. "Red and blue states ensure that locale magnifies differences
that were mostly manageable ..." Again, Professor Fiorina puts the
counterview. "To understand contemporary American political life, you
should begin with the realisation that most of the people blabbering on
cable television, venting on Facebook, and/or fulminating on Twitter are
abnormal. They are abnormally interested and involved in politics, they
tend to occupy the policy extremes, and they are abnormally
opinionated." He states that out of the 235 million voters in the US,
only one per cent subscribe to the likes of either The New York Times or
The Wall Street Journal. "Liberals rail against Fox News and
conservatives against MSNBC; they should take consolation in the fact
that the Fox viewing audience is about one per cent of the eligible
electorate while news shows on MSNBC fall short of that ... Granted,
these small audiences may spread the word to some non-subscribers and
non-viewers, but even taking such second-order effects into account, the
simple fact is that the ranks of the politically interested are
surprisingly thin." But is ignorance enough to defend US democracy?
CULTURAL REVOLUTION? Professor Turchin argues that the outrage expressed
by politicians, social media and media is symptomatic of almost
unprecedented levels of inequality within US society. And unequal
societies generally turn a corner only once they have passed through a
long spell of political instability, he says: "Put simply, it is fear of
revolution that restores equality". The US has been on the brink of this
precipice before, as recently as 1920. Extreme social insecurity led to
race riots, worker revolts and terror campaigns targeting 'elites'. "The
worst incident in US labour history was the West Virginia Mine War of
1920---21, culminating in the Battle of Blair Mountain," Professor
Turchin says. "Although it started as a workers' dispute, the Mine War
eventually turned into the largest armed insurrection that the US has
ever seen, the Civil War excepted. Between 10,000 and 15,000 miners
armed with rifles battled against thousands of strikebreakers and
sheriff deputies." The US army had to be called in --- against its own
people --- to quell the uprising. But Professor Fiorina points out that
the current level of political violence is lower than that of another US
cultural crisis point, the 1960s. "Our country is experiencing rapid
social changes that naturally create social problems and political
controversies," he writes. "The American citizenry has worked through
these kinds of problems in the past (most recently in the 1960s), and I
am optimistic that they will continue to do so ... Whenever you are
feeling discouraged about America, turn off CNN, log off your computer,
and go walk the aisles of Walmart." Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q.
is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don\'t feel so stupid
or insecure,it\'s not your fault --- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)

social media.]{.underline} "[Three years ago I published a short article
in the science journal Nature," Professor Turchin says. "I pointed out
that several leading indicators of political instability look set to
peak around 2020. In other words, we are rapidly approaching a
historical cusp, at which the US will be particularly vulnerable to
violent upheaval.]{.underline} "This prediction is not a 'prophecy'. "I
don't believe that disaster is preordained, no matter what we do. On the
contrary, if we understand the causes, we have a chance to prevent it
from happening. But the first thing we will have to do is reverse the
trend of ever-growing inequality." Dr Hanson sums it up: "Whether we all
take a deep breath, and understand our present dangerous trajectory,
will determine whether 2019 becomes 1861."

#### Civil war on the brink now

How, when, and why has [the United States]{.underline} now [arrived at
the brink of a veritable civil war]{.underline}? [Almost every cultural
and social institution]{.underline} --- universities, the public
schools, the NFL, the Oscars, the Tonys, the Grammys, late-night
television, public restaurants, coffee shops, movies, TV, stand-up
comedy --- has [been not just politicized but also
weaponized.]{.underline} Donald Trump's election was not so much a
catalyst for the divide as a manifestation and amplification of the
existing schism. [We are now nearing a point comparable to 1860, and
perhaps past 1968]{.underline}. Left--Right factionalism is increasingly
fueled by geography --- always history's force multiplier of civil
strife. Red and blue states ensure that locale magnifies differences
that were mostly manageable during the administrations of Ford, Carter,
Reagan, the Bushes, and Clinton. [What has caused the United States to
split apart so rapidly? Globalization Globalization had an unfortunate
effect of undermining national unity. It created new iconic
billionaires]{.underline} in high tech and finance, and their
subsidiaries of coastal elites, [while hollowing out the muscular jobs
largely in the American interior.]{.underline} Ideologies and apologies
accumulated to justify the new divide. In a reversal of cause and
effect, losers, crazies, clingers, American "East Germans," and
deplorables themselves were blamed for driving industries out of their
neighborhoods (as if the characters out of Duck Dynasty or Ax Men turned
off potential employers). Or, more charitably to the elites, the
muscular classes were too racist, xenophobic, or dense to get with the
globalist agenda, and deserved the ostracism and isolation they suffered
from the new "world is flat" community. London and New York shared far
more cultural affinities than did New York and Salt Lake City.
Meanwhile, the naturally progressive, more enlightened, and certainly
cooler and hipper transcended their parents' parochialism and therefore
plugged in properly to the global project. And they felt that they were
rightly compensated for both their talent and their ideological
commitment to building a better post-American, globalized world. One
cultural artifact was that as our techies and financiers became rich, as
did those who engaged in electric paper across time and space (lawyers,
academics, insurers, investors, bankers, bureaucratic managers), the
value of muscularity and the trades was deprecated. That was a strange
development. After all, prestige cars, kitchen upgrades, gentrified home
remodels, and niche food were never more in demand by the new elite. But
who exactly laid the tile, put the engine inside the cars, grew the
arugula, or put slate on the new hip roof? [In this same era, a series
of global financial shocks, from the dot-com bust to the more radical
2008 near--financial meltdown, reflected a radical ongoing restructuring
in American middle-class life, characterized by stagnant net income,
family disintegration, and eroding consumer confidence]{.underline}. No
longer were youth so ready to marry in their early twenties, buy a home,
and raise a family of four or five. Compensatory ideology made the
necessary adjustments to explain the economic doldrums and began to
characterize what was impossible first as undesirable and later as near
toxic. Pajama Boy sipping hot chocolate in his jammies, and the
government-subsidized Life of Julia profile, became our new American
Gothic. [High Tech The mass production of cheap consumer goods, most
assembled abroad, redefined wealth or, rather, disguised
poverty]{.underline}. Suddenly the lower middle classes and the poor had
in their palms the telecommunications power of the Pentagon of the
1970s, the computing force of IBM in the 1980s, and the entertainment
diversity of the rich of the 1990s. They could purchase big screens for
a fraction of what their grandparents paid for black-and-white
televisions and with a computer be entertained just as well cocooning in
their basement as by going out to a concert, movie, or football game.
But such electronic narcotics did not hide the fact that in terms of
economics the lifestyles of their ancestors were eroding. The new normal
was two parents at work, none at home; renting as often as buying; an
eight-year rather than three-year car loan; fewer grandparents around
the corner for babysitting or to assist when ill; and consumer service
defined as hearing taped messages of an hour before reaching a helper in
India or Vietnam. [High-tech gadgetry and the power to search the
Internet did not seem to make Americans own more homes, pay off loans
more quickly, or know their neighbors better]{.underline}. If in 1970 a
nerd slandered one on the sidewalk and talked trash, he might not do it
twice; in 2018, he did it electronically, boldly, and with impunity
behind an array of masked social-media identities. [The Campus Higher
education surely helped split the country in tw]{.underline}o. In the
1980s, the universities embraced two antithetical agendas, both costly
and reliant on borrowed money. On the one hand, campuses competed for
scarcer students by styling themselves as Club Med--type resorts with
costly upscale dorms, tony student-union centers, lavish gyms, and an
array of in loco parentis social services. The net effect was to make
colleges responsible not so much for education, but more for shielding
now-fragile youth from the supposed reactionary forces that would buffet
them after graduation. But if campus materialism was at odds with
classroom socialism, few seemed to notice. Instead, the idea grew up
that one had no need to follow concretely the consequences of his
abstract ideology. Or even worse, one's hard-left politics --- the
louder and more strident the better --- became a psychological means of
squaring the circle of denouncing the West while being affluent and
enjoying the material comforts of the good life. [Universities grew not
just increasingly left-wing but far more intolerant than they were
during the radicalism of the Sixties]{.underline} --- but again in an
infantile way. Speakers were shouted down to prove social-justice fides.
"Studies" courses squeezed out philosophy and Latin. History became a
melodramatic game of finding sinners and saints, rather than shared
tragedy. Standards fell to accommodate poorly prepared incoming
students, on the logic that old norms were arbitrary and discriminatory
constructs anyway. The curriculum now was recalibrated as therapeutic;
it no longer aimed to challenge students by demanding wide reading,
composition skills, and mastery of the inductive method. The net result
was the worst of all possible worlds: An entire generation of students
left college with record debt, mostly ignorant of the skills necessary
to read, write, and argue effectively, lacking a general body of shared
knowledge --- and angry. They were often arrogant in their determination
to actualize the ideologies of their professors in the real world. A
generation ignorant, arrogant, and poor is a prescription for social
volatility. Frustration and failure were inevitable, more so when
marriage and home-owning in a stagnant economy were now encumbered by
\$1 trillion in student loans. New conventional wisdom recalibrated the
nuclear family and suburban life as the font of collective unhappiness.
The result was the rise of the stereotypical single 28-year-old ---
furious at an unfair world that did not appreciate his unique sociology
or environmental-studies major, stuck in his parents' basement or
garage, working enough at low-paying jobs to pay for entertainments, if
his room, board, and car were subsidized by his aging and retired
parents. Illegal Immigration [Immigration was recalibrated hand-in-glove
by progressives who wanted a new demographic to vote for leftist
politicians]{.underline} and by Chamber of Commerce conservatives who
wished an unlimited pool of cheap unskilled labor. The result was waves
of illegal, non-diverse immigrants who arrived at precisely the moment
when the old melting pot was under cultural assault. The old
black--white dichotomy in the United States was being recalibrated as
"diversity," or in racialist terms as a coalition now loosely and often
grossly inexactly framed as non-white versus the (supposedly shrinking)
white majority. Compensatory politics redefined illegal immigration once
it was clear that not just a few million but perhaps one day 20 million
potential new voters would remake the Electoral College. Difference was
now no longer a transitory prelude to assimilation but a desirable
permanent and separatist tribalism, even as it became harder to define
exactly what ethnic and racial difference really was in an increasingly
intermarried society. We soon went from the buffoonery of a wannabe
Native American Ward Churchill to the psychodrama of an Islamist,
anti-Semitic Linda Sarsour. The Obama Project We forget especially the
role of Barack Obama. He ran as a Biden Democrat renouncing gay
marriage, saying, "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am
not in favor of gay marriage." Then he "evolved" on the question and
created a climate in which to agree with this position could get one
fired. He promised to close the border and reduce illegal immigration:
"We will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who
are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the
workplace. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of
laws." Then he institutionalized the idea that to agree with that
now-abandoned agenda was a career-ender. Obama vowed to "work across the
aisle" and was elected on the impression that he was a "bridge builder"
who would heal racial animosity, restore U.S. prestige abroad, and
reignite the economy after the September 2008 meltdown. Instead, he
weaponized the IRS, the FBI, the NSC, the CIA, and the State Department
and redefined the deep state as if it were the Congress, but with the
ability to make and enforce laws all at once. "Hope and Change" became
"You didn't build that!" President Obama, especially in his second term,
soon renounced much of what he had run on. He raised taxes, stagnated
what would have been a natural recovery, weighed in on hot-button
racialized criminal cases, advanced a radical social agenda, and
polarized the country along lines of difference. Again, Obama most
unfortunately redefined race as a white-versus-nonwhite binary, in an
attempt to build a new coalition of progressives, on the unspoken
assumption that the clingers were destined to slow irrelevance and with
them their retrograde and obstructionist ideas. In other words, the Left
could win most presidential elections of the future, as Obama did, by
writing off the interior and hyping identity politics on the two coasts.
The Obama administration hinged on leveraging these sociocultural,
political, and economic schisms even further. The split pitted
constitutionalism and American exceptionalism and tradition on the one
side versus globalist ecumenicalism and citizenry of the world on the
other. Of course, older divides --- big government, high taxes,
redistributionist social-welfare schemes, and mandated equality of
result versus limited government, low taxes, free-market individualism,
and equality of opportunity --- were replayed, but sharpened in these
new racial, cultural, and economic landscapes.

#### Civil War possible

Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a senior
fellow of the Center for European Studies, Harvard, where he served for

closer to civil war,\" 10-28-2018,
http://www.niallferguson.com/journalism/miscellany/america-is-edging-closer-to-civil-war,

I have no doubt that somewhere in academia someone is busy devising an
American civil war Doomsday Clock. Any day now they'll publish it under
the headline "Two minutes to Fort Sumter". [But just how close is the
United States to the kind of internecine slaughter that began when
Confederate forces opened fire on South Carolina's best-known fort in
April 1861?]{.underline} As I've argued on this page before, [there is a
kind of cultural civil war already being fought]{.underline} on social
media. With the mid-term elections just over a week away, [that culture
war gets more febrile by the day.]{.underline} (I especially enjoyed the
latest self-flagellating ravings of the professor at Emory University
who decided to denounce himself for sexist thoughtcrimes. He really
would have enjoyed Mao's Cultural Revolution.) Of course, the culture
war is no more a real war than the trade war Donald Trump has launched
against China. [Nevertheless, the news last week that amateurish pipe
bombs had been posted to a dozen of the president's best-known critics,
including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, the hedge fund billionaire
George Soros and the actor Robert De Niro, provided the cue for new
prophecies of **a second American Civil War**.]{.underline} The arrest
on Friday of a Florida man named Cesar Sayoc, 56, was greeted with cries
of "Gotcha!". His van was covered in pro-Trump stickers including one
reading "CNN sucks". "Trump owns this!" declared a normally sober
Washington correspondent. I wonder. I don't much like Trump's regular
criticisms of the mainstream media and occasional glorification of
body-slamming. But a direct causal relationship to a nut posting a bunch
of homemade bombs? Strange how in June last year the same journalist
omitted to tweet, "Sanders owns this!" after the Republican congressman
Steve Scalise and three other people were shot and wounded by James
Hodgkinson, a left-wing supporter of Bernie Sanders. You may say that
Sanders's rhetoric was never as inflammatory as Trump's, but these are
fine distinctions. In 2016 Sanders called Trump "particularly dangerous
and un-American", accusing him of "bigotry". In July of this year he
called Trump "our idiot president". [Yesterday's massacre at a synagogue
in Pittsburgh makes matters much worse. Trump is no anti-semite, but
some alt-right elements routinely abuse Jews. But then again, the hard
left has its anti-semites too. That people on both sides of the
political divide are using intemperate language is undeniable, even if
the left will always insist the other side is worse. That there is a
potential for an increase in US political violence seems clear. By
European standards there are terrifying numbers of lethal weapons in
private hands. But civil war? Some]{.underline} of the people who make
this argument [can be dismissed as scaremongers]{.underline}. When a
Canadian novelist fantasises about Trump being assassinated, the United
States tearing itself apart and all the nice Americans moving to Canada,
it's better to avert your gaze. Same drill when a marine turned chat
show host calls for red states to secede if a future Democratic
administration comes for their guns. [But when a colleague at the Hoover
Institution, the historian Victor Davis Hanson, warns that we are "at
the brink of a veritable civil war", we all need to pay attention. The
same goes for the National Review's Reihan Salam]{.underline}, whose new
book argues that without root-and-branch immigration reform, the US will
come apart at the seams. [I also take seriously the work of Peter
Turchin, who has been arguing for some time that several leading
indicators of political instability (notably inequality) are set to peak
around 2020, making the US "particularly vulnerable to violent
upheaval". Hanson's argument is that the tensions arising from
globalisation, the internet, campus leftism and illegal immigration have
led to an ideological split that is also geographical. The toxic
atmosphere puts him in mind not only of the 1850s but also of the 5th
century BC, when "stasis" (meaning internal strife) tore apart the
ancient Greek city states.]{.underline} Like our colleague Morris
Fiorina, I am inclined towards the optimistic view that most normal
Americans find the culture war exhausting. As I argued here last week,
the evidence suggests that the extreme right and extreme left are two
noisy minorities. They would be lost without one another, but they turn
everyone else off. [Hanson, who still sees further polarisation as
avoidable, makes a crucial point, though. History repeatedly shows that
"zealous and sometimes warring tiny minorities can escalate tensions,
nullify opposition and bully the silenced majority to sanction --- or at
least not object to --- violence".]{.underline} The most troubling
analogy I heard last week was between the 2020 presidential election and
that of 1860. My interlocutor noted that Abraham Lincoln won a four-way
race in 1860. If a centrist, say the Ohio governor John Kasich, runs as
an independent, if the Democrats nominate a progressive (Kamala Harris,
anyone?) and if Trump seeks re-election, we could have a somewhat
similar situation. [The implication is not comforting. For the election
of 1860 made clear that the divisions over the issue of slavery had
become unbridgeable. Lincoln's victory was swiftly followed by the
secession of seven Southern states and the formation of the Confederacy.
True, there is no single issue in today's culture war. True, the time on
the civil war Doomsday Clock looks more like 11.08 than 11.58. But when
I tell you who drew the 1860 analogy to my attention, you'll know why
I'm troubled. Reader, it was Steve Bannon.]{.underline}

### Civil War Impact---Assassination Internal

#### Assassinations cause civil war and foreign intervention

Christopher Zorn Department of Political Science Pennsylvania State
University The Political Consequences of Assassination Journal of
Conflict Resolution Volume 52 Number 3 June 2008 385-400

Conclusion Former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli is said to
have remarked that ''assassination has never changed the history of the
world.'' Yet [our analyses here suggest that the assassination of a
state's leader can, in fact, have serious repercussions for that state's
internal political stability]{.underline}. In particular, such
[assassinations significantly increase the likelihood of violent
manifestations of dissent, such as coups, revolutions, **and civil
wars**.]{.underline} Based on these findings, [the assassination of a
head of state is clearly an important form of political violence and one
that warrants systematic study of both its causes and its
consequences.]{.underline} Here, we have presented an analysis of the
relationship between assassination and a range of types of political
instability from political unrest and protest to civil war. [Our
findings support a neoinstitutional view of that relationship:
assassinations' adverse political effects are generally assuaged by the
presence of a standardized means for leadership succession. That
conclusion is, at one level, unsurprising]{.underline}---the key role of
such mechanisms is to ensure that the legitimacy and authority of the
state lives on after the death of the leader. [The consequences of the
assassination of a head of state]{.underline}, however, [are not limited
to expressions of political dissent. The termination of a political
regime through assassination could have significant implications for the
political institutions of a state and subsequent regimes. For instance,
is the assassination of a repressive and autocratic leader followed by
reform of political institutions and a democratic leadership? To the
extent that assassinations often reflect a desperate need to usher in
political change, it would be worthwhile to examine the kind of
institutional change---if any---that is instigated after an
assassination]{.underline}. On one hand, the demise of an autocratic
leader may provide an opportunity---and the necessary environment---for
setting up democratic institutions. Conversely, [the political tumult
and instability following an assassination may result in enabling an
equally despotic leader from an opposing faction to seize
power.]{.underline} Beyond its political consequences, [the societal
shock of an assassination may also have economic effects. Both private
and public enterprises rely on political and governmental stability for
their efficient operations. It is likely that the assassination of a
head of state affects economic and commercial policies in ways that
disrupt the domestic economy and/or international trade]{.underline}.
Thus, the relationship between assassination and aspects of domestic and
international political economy is a valuable direction for future
research. [Yet another dimension of the effects of assassination may be
regional instability.]{.underline} Since assassination increases the
likelihood of political instability and domestic militarized conflict in
a state, is it possible that this instability could diffuse to other
states in a region? As we note above, [it is not unusual for neighboring
states to become involved in civil wars]{.underline}, for instance,
[through troop contributions or refugee flows]{.underline} (see, e.g.,
Gleditsch 2007). [The death of a state leader may also be viewed by
international rivals as an opportune time for invasion, linking
assassination to international conflict]{.underline}. In summary, a host
of possible consequences of assassination remain to be explored.

The best that the federal government could do in a second civil war
would be to keep the most dangerous weapons -- nuclear weapons and ICBMs
-- out of the hands of the combatants. Because of the intermingling of
right and left throughout the country, [the flow of refugees would be
enormous, and the impact on the economy and infrastructure would clearly
be devastating. There would also be serious danger of foreign
intervention. Countries like China, Russia -- even Mexico and Canada --
would be tempted to carve out either territory or spheres of influence,
and a weakened federal government would be ill-equipped to stop them.
The ultimate partition of the country would also provide the global
community opportunities for exploitation]{.underline}. Whatever the
final resolution, [a divided America would pay a steep price in
resources and territory.]{.underline} It may be entertaining as a writer
to spin out a civil war scenario, but [it is incredibly dangerous for
groups on the fringe or organizations like the NRA to be dog-whistling
to their supporters about the prospect of a second civil
war]{.underline}. To those who are contemplating such a course, or even
using it as a tactic to rally support, [it is worth considering what
such a conflict might look like, and the devastation it would reap on

That said, no one should fool themselves into thinking that Javelin
missiles are a game-changer. Javelins are useful weapons that will have
a limited deterrent effect, but [they won\'t change the fighting
capabilities of the Ukrainian military all that much]{.underline}. Far
more important is the military\'s command structure, which desperately
needs to be reformed according to Western standards, and the training
and readiness of the troops, which also need urgent attention. [Finally,
it\'s important to remember that Ukraine is paying for these missiles.
It would be far better if Ukraine reformed its defense industry so that
it could produce and sell anti-tank weapons itself, rather than having
to buy them from Western countries]{.underline}.

In the event of further Russian offensives, Javelins ensure Russian
costs increase (although those costs would largely be in the form of
proxy casualties, a limited disincentive for Russia). [U.S. Javelins ---

4 Discussion and ConclusionConsidering the conducted research it is
possible to draw the following conclusions.Firstly[, Ukraine has an
important geopolitical and geo-economic situation, making it an
important transport and logistics hub within the framework of the Silk
Road Infrastructure Project, which aims to connect Europe and Asia more
closely. The Silk Road initiative gives Ukraine the technical ability to
bypass the restrictions imposed by Russia on the transit of its products
to the countries of Central AsiaMoreover, our country is interesting to
China as a production site for further export to the EU]{.underline}.
This aspect has a positive impact on the development of
Ukrainian-Chinese economic relations.Secondly, China is one However, the
trade balance for Ukraine is negative. Imports of goods from China to
Ukraine in 2016, according to state statistics, grew by 24.3% (to \$
4687.7 million), exports decreased by 24.1% compared to 2015 (before \$
1832.5 million). However there is a mutual aspiration of the parties
before increase in volumes of bilateral trade, diversification of its
structure, development of long-term forms of economic cooperation,
deepening of investment interaction between Ukraine and China. The
deepening of trade relations with the PRC positively affects Ukraine\'s
economic growth, however, the current dynamics of the trade balance
between Ukraine and the PRC, given the significant predominance of
imports, requires careful review of trade policy measures. Therefore,
our proposals are as follows:1. To improve the structure of trade,
introducing new forms of trade relations, in particular industrial
cooperation, cooperation on a compensation basis and the organization of
joint productions through the purchase of licenses.2. To search for ways
to reduce the energy intensity of export industries as it significantly
affects the competitiveness of Ukrainian exports.3. To develop the
institutional framework for cooperation, which should include not only
interstate macroeconomic, but also a number of sectoral bodies for
establishing effective cooperation in specific areas.4. To stimulate the
means of tariff and non-tariff regulation of imports into Ukraine of
mainly investment high-tech goods. 5. Creation of a common investment
fund on parity terms.Thirdly, China is interested to invest the
investments in economy of Ukraine, considering its branched transport
system, existence of a powerful scientific and industrial complex,
access to the markets of the European Union. It is confirmed by a number
of already realized investment projects (the creation of Beijing
Skyrizon Aviation Industry Investment Co Ltd and Motor Sich joint
venture,tart in 2016 in the Nikolaev sea trade port transshipment
facility of grain and oil-bearing crops, etc). And today [the
complementary nature of economic systems, the presence of a significant
potential for cooperation in the trade, economic, scientific and
technical, and humanitarian sectors create the necessary prerequisites
for the progressive development of mutually beneficial Ukrainian-Chinese
relations.]{.underline}

#### Chinese-Ukraine relations key to the Chinese space program

Frank **[[Fang 19]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, \"China And Ukraine'S
Space, Military Cooperation Raises Alarm,\" Epoch Times, 2-19-2019,
https://www.theepochtimes.com/china-and-ukraines-space-and-military-cooperation-raises-alarm_2807200.html,

After years of relying on Soviet space technology, China now turns to
Ukraine to fulfill its space ambition, according to Ukrainian media.
[The country's local broadcaster Channel 24 reported Jan. 18 that
Ukranian-Chinese cooperation in the space sector is now gaining
momentum, with much of it centered around its state-owned designer of
satellites and rockets, the Yuzhnoye State Design Office. "How will the
White House react, if soon, China will land on the Moon with the help of
Soviet technology sold by Ukraine?" the report asked. The report stated
that U.S. officials have expressed concerns about close business ties
with China, accusing Ukraine of "betrayal and have threatened
sanctions." The alarm went off after the Washington Times first reported
in August 2018 that Chinese jet trainers JL-10---used for training
Chinese pilots how to land on aircraft carriers---were being powered by
engines supplied by Ukrainian engine manufacturer Motor Sich. In
September 2018, Ukraine's local newspaper Kyiv Post reported that an
unnamed U.S. Pentagon official visited Ukraine to warn of the dangers of
Chinese investments in Ukraine.]{.underline} [The official stated that
Beijing wanted to "scoop up know-how by transferring manufacturing to
China" and "import \[Ukraine's\] defense industry production so
\[China\] can reverse-engineer and produce \[the
technology]{.underline}\]." Yuzhnoye Yuzhnoye, formerly known as OKB-586
and the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, was founded in 1954 under the Soviet
Union and led by former leading Soviet missile designer Mikhail Yangel.
The organization developed and manufactured the Soviet Union's
intermediate-range ballistic missile R-12. The deployment of these
missiles led to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The organization was also
a part of the development of space technologies. The bureau was involved
in the development of the LK lunar lander in the 1960s as a Soviet
attempt at moon exploration. After the Soviet Union fell apart, Yuzhnoye
was controlled by Ukraine. In 1999, Ukraine successfully launched the
Dnepr rocket designed by Yuzhnoye, a space launch vehicle converted from
the ballistic missile R-36. In recent years, the company has worked with
China on multiple projects. In September 2013, during the 64th
International Astronautical Congress in Beijing, Yuzhnoye General
Director Alexander Degtyarev announced that the company was in
discussion with Beijing about the possibility of cooperation in lunar
exploration, according to Ukraine's official space web portal. He added
that there were contracts between the two sides already being
implemented. In May 2017, Li Ping, director of China's state-run Xi'an
Aerospace Propulsion Institute, attended roundtable meetings at the
sidelines of an international space conference called "Space
Technologies: Present and Future" co-organized by Yuzhnoye and held in
the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a press release on the
company's website. A month later, U.S. magazine Popular Mechanics,
citing unnamed sources, reported that Yuzhnoye was asked by Chinese
officials to rebuild the propulsion system on the LK lunar lander.
Development of the lander had been shelved by the Soviet Union after the
United States put astronauts on the moon in 1969. Under the new
agreement with China, Ukraine would supply the design document for the
propulsion system, but the hardware would remain in Ukraine. "In the
future, Ukrainians might assist the Chinese in organizing the production
of the technology in China," Popular Mechanics reported. The sources
also said that China would use the rebuilt propulsion system to build a
larger lunar lander, with the goal of carrying two or three Chinese
astronauts to the moon. In November 2018, Yuzhnoye took part in the
annual aircraft and aerospace trade expo, the Airshow China, held in
Zhuhai City in southern China's Guangdong Province. On the company's
official website, Yuzhnoye said it had aerospace products including
rocket and aviation engines on display. Ukraine and China [The Ukraine
government also explored business opportunities in space with
China.]{.underline} In 2011, the two countries established the
Commission for Cooperation to develop bilateral cooperation in space,
science, technology, and medicine, according to the official website of
Ukraine's embassy in China. A special subcommission was created to
encourage developments in space. In November 2018, Pavlo Degtyarenko,
head of Ukraine's state space agency, met with Zhang Kejian, director of
the China National Space Administration, at a subcommission meeting held
in Beijing, where the two sides agree to expand the number of space
cooperation projects to 80. They also agreed to future cooperation in
space debris monitoring and researching of deep space.

#### Chinese-Ukraine relations key to Chinese military modernization

Space, Military Cooperation Raises Alarm,\" Epoch Times, 2-19-2019,

Military Tech [China has relied on Ukraine for many other military
technologies. Most notable is Ukraine's sale of a partially completed
aircraft carrier in 1998]{.underline} to China, [which the Chinese
regime converted into its first modern aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.
It was launched in 2012.]{.underline} The Telegraph reported that in
2001, [Ukrainian and Russian businessmen sold Soviet-era X-55 cruise
missiles, which had a range of 1,800 miles, to China from Ukraine's
missile stockpiles. Ukraine also helped develop China's indigenous
phased-array radar system]{.underline}, according to a November 2017
article published by Tokyo-based magazine The Diplomat. [The radar
system, which allows constant watch over a target, is the Chinese
equivalent of the U.S. Aegis combat system. And in 2017, private
aeronautical engine company Beijing Skyrizon Aviation and Ukrainian firm
Motor Sich agreed to set up a Chinese assembly and servicing plant to
manufacture aircraft engines]{.underline} in the southwestern city of
Chongqing. In November 2018, Chinese news portal Sina reported that
first-phase construction of the plant was complete. According to an
unconfirmed report published on multiple Chinese news sites, including
Chinese news portal Sohu, about 3,000 scientists, engineers, and other
technicians from Ukraine would relocate to China along with their
families in relation to the Chongqing plant. "[Chinese poaching of
Ukrainian aerospace, tank, and naval engineers" is becoming
common]{.underline}, stated the American bimonthly magazine National
Interest in an article published June 2018. The article mentioned the
prominent example of Valerii Babich, the original designer of the
Liaoning aircraft carrier, when the ship was first launched in
Ukraine---under the name Varyag---in 1988. In September 2017, Chinese
media The Paper reported that Babich had been hired by the Qingdao
City-based China-Ukraine Special Ships Research and Design Academy
(CUSA). CUSA is a research and development collaboration founded in
September 2014 by the Qingdao municipal government, the state-run
Shandong Province Academy of Sciences, and a Ukrainian shipyard,
according to The Paper. The number of Ukrainian expats hired to work for
Chinese firms is significant enough that there are rumors of
"Ukrainetowns" in some Chinese cities, the magazine reported.

#### The relationship between Ukraine and China is complicating Ukraine's attempt at NATO membership

JEJP

[On June 21, a new law on national security passed by Ukraine's
lawmakers was welcomed as a strong step on the **country's path to
Euro-Atlantic integration and eventual membership of the Nato
alliance**]{.underline}. [President Petro Poroshenko said the
legislation would improve military-technical cooperation between Ukraine
and Nato and reaffirms the country's strategic pivot to the
West]{.underline}. His government now plans to include the law in
Ukraine's constitution. "The idea of Ukraine joining Nato has a very
strong base of popular and political support," said Ukrainian member of
parliament Svitlana Zalishchuk. "[Because of our country's security
challenges, joining this alliance is even more popular than the idea of
EU membership right now. For the first time we see president, prime
minister and a majority in parliament all agreeing that it's the right
path.]{.underline}" But as politicians and the public reaffirm their
commitment to membership of the transatlantic alliance, some observers
see a challenge on the horizon: [Ukraine has also become an important
strategic partner for China]{.underline}. Since the outbreak of war with
Russian-backed separatists in eastern Donbas in 2014, Kiev has sought to
build strong ties with both the West and Beijing. At the same time, [the
alliance between China and Russia has grown much stronger
too]{.underline}. High-level meetings between Russian and Chinese
leaders this year have seen ties between the two countries reach new
heights: a formal military alliance, pledges to improve cooperation on
the international stage and at least US\$1 billion in new, joint
investments abroad. On June 8, [Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping issued a
statement saying they would together face the challenges of an
increasingly unstable and uncertain world, [deepening their
cooperation](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2149991/xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-hail-all-time-high-ties-sign) on
issues of "strategic stability".]{.underline} Some analysts feel China
is acting out of self-interest in Ukraine but also serving --
intentionally or not -- as a proxy for Russia's agenda. "China has a
very aggressive economic strategy in Europe," said Jack Keane, a retired
US army general and chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, in a
recent interview with US think tank Atlantic Council. "What will follow
is geopolitical influence to move Ukraine away from the West." Ukraine
currently finds itself tangled at the centre of a complicated
geopolitical web, with the United States, the European Union, China and
Russia all trying to pull the country in their direction. With Russia
sidelined[, China takes the lead in pushing deep into Ukraine, investing
billions into infrastructure, agriculture and energy. But Ukrainian
aerospace and weapons technology has also grabbed Beijing's attention
and state owned companies have been making moves]{.underline}. China
increasingly looks to Ukraine to help its armed forces become
self-sufficient in the p-roduction of military hardware. Beijing
Skyrizon Aviation is currently trying to buy a [controlling stake in
Ukrainian
company](http://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2151183/air-blocked-chinese-takeover-ukrainian-aerospace-firm-no-closer)
[Motor
Sich](http://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2151183/air-blocked-chinese-takeover-ukrainian-aerospace-firm-no-closer),
one of the world\'s largest manufacturers of engines for military
aircraft. Another company aims to buy two Antonov An-225 Mriyas -- the
world's largest cargo planes -- but build them in China[. On June 20, as
parliament debated the new Law on National Security, Hanna Hopko -- head
of Ukraine's Committee on Foreign Affairs -- highlighted growing
**concerns over Beijing's move into Ukraine's aerospace industry**. She
said it was damaging to Ukraine and its Nato allies. "It's extraordinary
that we would allow a strategic partner of Moscow to acquire such
sensitive and unique technology," she said. "It strikes not only at the
security of Ukraine but also our key partners and allies around the
world, particularly in Asia."]{.underline} But on June 25, the Ukrainian
government signed another law that will result in a sharp increase in
the import and export of arms. Previously permitted only for state-owned
companies, relaxation of the regulations means that private firms can
now cash in on the Chinese export market too. [While most Nato countries
have a moratorium on the sale of weapons and weapon technology to China,
it has become Ukraine's biggest market with US\$100 million in annual
sales]{.underline}. [Ukrainian parts can already be found in Chinese
military hardware from fighter jets and long-range missiles and aircraft
carriers.]{.underline} It is a headache for Ukraine's Nato allies who
would prefer that Kiev didn't arm the PLA. But the manufacturers, under
severe financial strain, say they are acting out of economic necessity.
"[In the case of Motor Sich, company bosses there say that they're doing
what they need to do in order to protect Ukrainian jobs]{.underline},"
said the EU's Ambassador to Ukraine Hugues Mingarelli. As part of
their [attempted takeover of the aerospace
company](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2111493/chinese-firms-stake-ukraine-military-aircraft-engine) --
currently frozen by Ukrainian courts [-- Chinese investors had pledged
to invest US\$250 million into Ukrainian factories]{.underline}.
According to Vasyl Filipchuk, a Ukrainian diplomat and head of the
International Centre for Policy Studies, China is acting in its own
self-interest. He said Ukraine should be open to any and all foreign
investment, but be stronger and focused on the national interest. "To
see Motor Sich taken over or Mryia aircraft being built in China would
be a shame," he said. "But this would be a sign of Ukrainian weakness
and our corruption as opposed to Chinese aggression." Svitlana
Zalishchuk, Ukrainian MP, said China and Russia -- no matter their
motives -- will not distract Ukraine from its Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
"[We have a complicated relationship with China and we see the strategic
partnership they have with Russia," she said. "But the path that
Ukrainian people have chosen and that we're focused on, is moving closer
to Europe and Nato."]{.underline}

[On February 1, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that **the
United States would suspend its obligations under the 1987
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty**.]{.underline} Pompeo
said Russia had violated the treaty for years. The next day, the State
Department notified the Russian embassy and the embassies of the
other treaty parties, including Ukraine, of the US intention to withdraw
from the treaty. [President Vladimir Putin that same day said that
Russia also would suspend its treaty obligations. Unfortunately, the INF
Treaty is headed for demise]{.underline}. Signed by Ronald Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, [the INF Treaty banned the United States and
Soviet Union from having land-based missiles with ranges between 500 and
5,500 kilometers.]{.underline} "Intermediate-range nuclear forces" is
something of misnomer, since the treaty does not constrain "nuclear"
forces; it bans land-based intermediate-range missiles---regardless of
whether they are nuclear or conventionally armed. The treaty entered
into force in June 1988. By June 1991, the United States and Soviet
Union had destroyed their inventories, which totaled nearly 2,700
missiles. In December 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. [The United
States and Russia, however, are not the only parties to the agreement.
Eleven other post-Soviet states became successors to the Soviet Union
for purposes of the INF Treaty, including Ukraine.]{.underline} (The
three Baltic states, which considered their incorporation into the
Soviet Union illegal and which had regained independence earlier in
1991, did not). In like manner in the 1992 Lisbon Protocol, Russia,
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine took on the Soviet Union's treaty
commitments under the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I). 
The latter three countries further committed to eliminate all strategic
offensive arms on their territory and to accede to the 1970
Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. What does this
short diplomatic history mean for Ukraine? With the United States and
Russia no longer subject to the INF Treaty's limits, it would be hard to
argue that Ukraine and the other states should remain constrained by the
agreement. **[If Kyiv chooses, it can invoke the same treaty right to
withdraw that Washington exercised two weeks ago.]{.underline}** Ukraine
would remain bound by other agreements. [The Non-Proliferation Treaty
bars it from acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Under the terms of
the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime, Ukraine has committed to
restrict exports of missiles that can carry a 500-kilogram warhead to
ranges of 300 kilometers or more. START I lapsed in 2009 and was
replaced by the 2010 New START Treaty, a bilateral US-Russian
agreement[. One might argue that Ukraine carried out its commitment made
at the time of the Lisbon Protocol to eliminate all strategic arms on
its territory but **did not commit to never acquire them in the
future**]{.underline}. An attempt to build intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs), however, would undoubtedly meet strong opposition from
the United States, whose ICBMs and other strategic arms are limited by
New START. [Land-based intermediate-range missiles, however, pose a
different question. The US government would have no legal grounds to
object if Ukraine were to withdraw from the INF Treaty, since Kyiv would
only be following Washington's lead.]{.underline} Moreover, given
ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine, [the US government would
have little basis for complaint if Kyiv concluded that
intermediate-range missiles could contribute to its capability to deter
further Russian hostilities]{.underline}---provided that those missiles
were armed with conventional, not nuclear, warheads. Others might
object. Russia certainly would, but Moscow has violated the 1994
Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, used military force to
illegally annex Crimea, invaded the Donbas, violated the INF Treaty by
deploying a prohibited intermediate-range cruise missile which can
target Ukraine as well as other countries in Europe, and suspended its
obligations under the treaty. Kyiv could be forgiven for giving any
Russian complaints short shrift. Some [European states might express
concern.]{.underline} Technically[, they could end up in range of
Ukrainian intermediate-range missiles.]{.underline} European Union
members and other European states, however, would have no more reason to
fear Ukrainian conventionally-armed intermediate-range missiles than
Polish F-16s carrying conventional bombs. And most European states
voiced no serious protest about Russia's violation of the INF Treaty
until just recently. This is not necessarily to advocate that Ukraine
proceed to develop and deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles.
The Ukrainian government would have to assess a host of political,
military, and cost factors, including weighing the potential military
benefits of having such missiles against the blowback from Moscow and
possibly some European states. But if Kyiv decides to withdraw from the
INF Treaty and consider building its own intermediate-range missiles, it
should be able to do so without fearing or facing a negative reaction
from the United States.

### A2 RU-China Thump

#### China-Russia cooperation does not signify a strong relationship---it's asymmetric at best

Leon **[[Aron, 4-4]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**-2019, \"Are Russia and
China Really Forming an Alliance?,\" Foreign Affairs,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-04-04/are-russia-and-china-really-forming-alliance>
JEJP

In March of 1969, Chinese troops ambushed and killed a Soviet border
patrol on an island near the Chinese-Russian border. Fighting on and
near the island lasted for months and ended with hundreds of
casualties[. Fifty years later, the ferocity of the skirmish between Mao
Zedong's China and Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union seems to belong to a
very distant past---so distant, indeed, that many
foreign-policy [experts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-beijing-moscow-axis-11549036661) are
convinced that an anti-U.S. alliance between the two countries
is [emerging](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-and-russia-strategic-alliance-making-38727).]{.underline}
Yet even half a century on, such an assessment stretches the evidence
beyond what it can bear. [On closer inspection, **Chinese-Russian
economic, foreign policy, and military cooperation is less than
impressive.** The history of relations between the two countries is
fraught, and they play vastly different roles in the world economy,
making a divergence in their objectives all but
unavoidable]{.underline}. In short, reports of a Russian-Chinese
alliance have been greatly exaggerated. Economic relations between
Russia and China are rapidly expanding, and [some
experts](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/19/as-western-ties-fray-putin-and-xi-are-increasingly-close/) have
cited these ties as evidence of a growing closeness between the two
countries. Indeed, just last year, bilateral trade increased by at least
15 percent compared to 2017 and reached a record [\$100
billion](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201901/10/WS5c3702efa3106c65c34e3bfe.html).
Yet [asymmetries in the scale and structure of bilateral commerce
suggest caution: although China is Russia's [second-largest
trading](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/isdb_results/factsheets/country/details_russia_en.pdf) partner
(after the EU) and Russia's largest individual partner in both exports
and imports, for China the Russian market is at best second-rate. Russia
ranks [tenth](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/isdb_results/factsheets/country/details_china_en.pdf) in
Chinese exports and does not make it into the top ten in either imports
or total trade. The structure of the trade is similarly skewed. More
than three-quarters of Russia's exports to China are raw materials,
specifically crude oil, wood, and coal.
China's [sales](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/CHN/Year/2017/TradeFlow/Export/Partner/RUS/Product/all-groups) to
Russia are 45 percent consumer goods and 38 percent electronics and
machinery.]{.underline}

Despite the fact that Sino-Russian relations are significantly improving
on multiple strategic domains, this does not mean that differences do
not exist. [**Severe differences in their worldviews and interests
exist, indicating that their current partnership will not necessarily
lead to a new Sino-Russian alliance** or a Sino-Russian-centric world
order. First, China's growing influence has an impact on the core of
what Russia considers its own [sphere of
influence](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002070209404900404?journalCode=ijxa).
Russia has made an effort to diplomatically engage the post-Soviet space
in both the economic and security realms through the Eurasian Economic
Union and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. However, through
China's Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing is building economic clout in
the region that could diminish Moscow's long-term
influence]{.underline}. However, to
avoid [alienating](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/02/28/cooperation-and-competition-russia-and-china-in-central-asia-russian-far-east-and-arctic-pub-75673) Russia
from its Central Asian calculations, China has expressed an interest to
coordinate China's Belt and Road Initiative to the Eurasian Economic
Union, and has stated it will
not [play](https://www.iris-france.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Asia-Focus-108-Eng.pdf) a
security role in the region (at least for now). But these pledges are
yet to be defined, and should raise concerns in Moscow. Another area
where there is the potential for Sino-Russian cooperation
and [competition](https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/Stimson%20-%20The%20Northern%20Sea%20Route%20-%20The%20Myth%20of%20Sino-Russian%20Cooperation.pdf)in
the future is the Arctic. Russia is an Arctic nation, but China's
influence there is growing, and it considers itself a "[near Arctic
state](http://english.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2018/01/26/content_281476026660336.htm)."
China is also collaborating with states involved in the region to
"participate in the governance of the Arctic," securing access to Arctic
Sea Lanes of Communication and safeguarding its interests. But China's
ice breakers on the Northern Sea Route could
raise [concerns](https://russiancouncil.ru/en/analytics-and-comments/analytics/the-northern-sea-route-a-national-or-an-international-transportation-corridor/) in
Russia. [Moscow has
already [rejected](https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/Stimson%20-%20The%20Northern%20Sea%20Route%20-%20The%20Myth%20of%20Sino-Russian%20Cooperation.pdf) China's

the Arctic as both countries
are [sensitive](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinese-nuclear-armed-submarines-russian-arctic-ports-it-could-happen-60302) when
it comes to sovereignty issues]{.underline}. [A second issue is the
Pacific, since both countries border this ocean, which could be a
complication for both budding regional powers]{.underline}. In an effort
to play an active role in the Asia-Pacific region, Moscow pivoted to
Asia
by [diversifying](https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/notes-de-lifri/russieneivisions/chutzpah-and-realism-vladimir-putin-and-making-russian) its
regional partnerships as relations with the United States and the
European Union soured. Moscow normalized relations with former Cold War
comrades, India and Vietnam, and nurtured new partnerships with Japan
and South Korea. [Although the Russian role in the region is still
limited by nature---and faces challenges, especially in the [economic
realm](http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/russia-japan-dialogue-the-sanctions-factor/) due
to U.S. sanctions---a number of these Asian countries have strained
relations with China]{.underline} (India, Japan and Vietnam, for
example). [Additionally, Russia would not be helpful when it comes to
China's claims in the South China Sea or in the Taiwan Straits,
particularly if Beijing were to decide to take the military
option.]{.underline} On the other hand, Russia amounts to less than two
percent of China's global trade and is merely its twelfth-largest
trading partner, while Russia's pivot to Asia has not
yet [materialized](https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/russias-pivot-asia) to
the extent Moscow was expecting. Third, Zbigniew Brzezinski, in his
book [The Grand Chessboard](https://amzn.to/2JqwotI), mentions the
possibility of a Chinese and Russian-led coalition that is united "by
complementary grievances." He compared this partnership to the
Sino-Soviet bloc from the early days of the Cold War, but noted that,
this time around, "[China would likely be the leader and Russia the
follower." The two countries have a shared vision of a multipolar world
order, except their definition of a "multipolar" differs. For Russia,
the order it is seeking entails a world with many poles, with
power [balanced](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/02/28/cooperation-and-competition-russia-and-china-in-central-asia-russian-far-east-and-arctic-pub-75673) among
the major powers. But for China, a major power's influence in the
international system would be correlated to a nation's economic
heft]{.underline}. Though the Sino-Russian partnership is growing by the
day and will continue to develop, and though both countries have
something to gain from [this "cooperative-competitive"
partnership,]{.underline} it [ultimately **benefits China at the expense
of Russia**]{.underline}. But creating a strategic alliance between the
two countries that could challenge the current world order (or as Bobo
Lo describes it,
"[disorder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Russia-New-World-Disorder-Bobo/dp/0815726090)")
seems unfeasible. For the present, China is committed to maintaining a
close partnership with Russia to avoid defeat in its geopolitical
competition with the United States. Russia feels similarly**[. Beijing
knows well the limitations of what Moscow can offer to China in economic
terms, and for that reason, a long-term alliance is not
feasible.]{.underline}**

To defend himself from accusations of collusion or collaboration with
Russian government officials during the 2016 presidential election and
after, President Trump [recently
repeated](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/425034-trump-i-have-been-tougher-on-russia-that-any-other-president)
a familiar claim: "I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or
Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President." His statement might
have been closer to the truth if he had referred to his administration
rather than himself. The Trump administration has a tough policy on
Russia, one that I mostly support. But Trump himself does not. For the
past two years, he has consistently made it clear that he does not
support his own administration's policy toward Russia. [The Trump
administration's [National Security Strategy
states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf)
very bluntly that "China and Russia challenge American power, influence,
and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity."
Trump, however, has never expressed support for this approach. He has
[said the exact
opposite](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/397157-trump-getting-along-with-russia-is-a-good-thing),
suggesting time and time again that he wants to be Russian President
Vladimir Putin's **friend**, and that "getting along with Russia is a
good thing, not a bad thing."]{.underline} After Putin invaded Ukraine
and annexed Crimea in 2014, the Obama administration increased military
spending in Europe and pushed for several enhancements of NATO
capabilities, including new troop deployments closer to Russian borders.
The Trump administration has supported and [expanded this
policy](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-weapons-ukraine-20171222-story.html).
As candidate and president, however, [Trump has persistently berated,
criticized and undermined NATO.]{.underline} [Most recently, we have
learned that Trump has even threatened to [withdraw from the
alliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html).
Even reports of these threats are a gift to Putin, since they undermine
the credibility on which its deterrent effect depends]{.underline}. The
Trump administration rightly has continued the Obama policy of
sanctioning Russian officials and companies in response to Putin's
belligerent behavior. Trump, however, has never expressed support for
these sanctions. When he signed into law Countering America's
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), [he made clear his disdain
for the
law](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/donald-trump-signs-russia-sanctions-bill-n788776).
And then out of the blue, [the Trump team has called for the lifting of
sanctions on the companies controlled by Oleg Deripaska, even though
Putin has not changed his belligerent behavior at all.]{.underline} In
November 2018, Putin detained two dozen Ukrainian sailors in
international waters. The Trump administration has rightly criticized

influence in the Middle East and place maximum pressure on Russia's most

American soldiers and equipment from Syria, exactly what Putin and his

the perfect opportunity to demonstrate toughness on this issue with
Putin at his side at a news conference in Helsinki after their summit
last summer, [Trump did the exact
opposite](http://time.com/5339848/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-summit-transcript/),

[added](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812): "President
Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would
be."]{.underline} At that same summit, [Putin told a crazy fairy tale to
Trump, and then to the world, about how a dozen former U.S. government
officials allegedly had helped to launder money from Russia and then
transfer some of these funds to the Clinton campaign]{.underline}. Putin
then asked Trump for the opportunity to interrogate these alleged
criminals. (Putin included me among them.) Trump called the idea an

Trump administration officials have occasionally --- though not as often
as they should --- criticized repressive Putin policies inside Russia.
[Trump himself has never said a word about the importance of defending
human rights in Russia. Not one word. On the contrary, he has repeatedly
[assigned moral
equivalency](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/02/06/we-cant-let-trump-go-down-putins-path/?utm_term=.6e8cbcb83ed7)
between how the United States behaves around the world and how Russia
behaves]{.underline}. When pressed to criticize Putin, Trump lambasted
the United States, saying, "We've got a lot of killers. What do you
think, our country's so innocent?" [Even on small issues of little
relevance to American national interests, Trump sides with
Putin]{.underline}. Why is Trump
[defending](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/03/politics/trump-cabinet-meeting-afghanistan-soviet-union/index.html)
the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan? Why is Trump expressing fear
that the [Montenegrins might spark World War
III](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/how-trump-destabilised-montenegro-with-a-few-words)?
These are Putin lines. Why is the president of the United States echoing
them? I cannot remember a policy --- be it toward Russia or any other
country --- in which there was such a wide gap between a presidential
administration and the president himself. It is unprecedented. The
important question, therefore, is not which U.S. president has been
tougher on Russia, but why our current president has gone to such great
lengths to distance himself from his own government's Russia policy.

#### Russian aggression is a myth portrayed by American media---reject the impact on face, their authors are biased.

[A couple of years ago the US was foaming at the mouth anticipating
being able to bomb Syria into oblivion, claiming as pretext Assad was
using chemical weapons. Once again the US was using the tired argument
that it was necessary to save the people by bombing them. Ask the
"people" of Libya, and Iraq, and Yemen, if they felt saved by being
bombed?]{.underline} We laid waste to Libya with 77 days of bombing and
devastated that country, along with the complete destruction of Iraq,
and now, with our invaluable assistance and weapons, we are doing
likewise to "save" the people of Yemen. Our thirst to bomb Syria a few
years ago was foiled by those evil Russians, who stepped in
diplomatically and got Assad to get rid of all Syria's chemical weapons.
Those nasty Russians would not let us have our bombing and prevented it
by using diplomacy. Is that why they now are our enemy? [Naturally we
would not be stopped, and found the pretext to bomb Syria anyway. Using
ISIS as an excuse, we are currently bombing Syria trying to usher in the
same kind of anarchy we brought to Iraq and Libya.]{.underline}
[Corporate media, shill mouthpiece of the US government, would have you
believe that the US is part of a world coalition that is bombing Syria,
when the fact is 99% of the bombing is done by the US
alone]{.underline}. In any case the end game is to reduce Syria to
chaos, death, destruction, and violence, which is well under way. Those
nasty Russians are again interfering by sending weapons to support the
Assad regime. It appears that our thirst to bomb, has forced the nasty
Russians to draw a line in the sand. They will support Assad and not
tolerate his overthrow by the US. We now know, thanks to the Guardian
and other UK news outlets, but relatively unreported in the US, that
apparently the Russians had negotiated a deal in 2012, in which Assad
would either share power or would step down, but the deal was ignored
and brushed aside by the US. Why? Because we wanted to rain down anarchy
on Syria by bombing it to oblivion. We did not want a diplomatic
solution, we wanted to bomb and cause pure anarchy, which is what we are
currently doing. Those nasty Russians were diplomatically trying to
prevent this from happening for the second time. They could not stop our
desire to bomb. [The US orchestrated a coup of a democratically elected
leader of the Ukraine and installed a US puppet, but blamed the next
door neighbor Russia for the troubles in the Ukraine.]{.underline} [We
also inflamed the US public by accusing Russia of expanding by taking
the Crimea by force, even though **99% of Crimeans wanted to belong to
Russia**, and this was achieved not by invasion, and not one single
death in the Crimea]{.underline}. Corporate media convinced the US
public that Russia had invaded militarily, and taken over the Crimea.
Not so; there was no invasion and not one person died in a popular turn
to Russia by the people of Crimea. [There are now various news reports
that have the US planning to place nuclear weapons to Germany. That's
right, nuclear weapons on Russia's front doorstep!]{.underline} First,
how would you like it as a German citizen, and then how you like it as a
Russian living next door? [**This is a provocative, foolish, dangerous,
militarily aggressive act by the US, but the media shills will depict
the Russians as the bad guys.** So who is the aggressor nation? How many
nations has Russia bombed in the past 25 years? How many nations has the
US bombed in the past 25 years? Russia has 2 military bases outside its
borders, while the US has over 700.]{.underline} So which nation is the
most aggressive? The US has killed approximately 4-5 million people
since 1963. How many innocents has Russia killed during that time? The
annual US military budget is 10 times higher than Russia's, so who is
the aggressor nation? There are US Special Forces operating in 81
foreign nations. Special Forces budget has increased fivefold since 2001
and their numbers have doubled. So who is the aggressor nation? The US
is planning to deploy nuclear weapons to Germany, and since 1776 the US
has been at war for 93% of its history. The US with its bombings of 14
nations in the Middle East, has unleashed one of the biggest refugee
crises in human history as people flee from US bombs and destruction. So
who is the aggressor; the US or Russia? [Pay no attention to corporate
media, get your own facts.]{.underline}

### No Impact -- Baltic Invasion

#### Russia does not have the military capability to invade eastern Europe 

Maxwell **[[Stangl]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**,

(Conventional) War in the Baltics,\" National

JEJP

The sound of BM-21 rockets streaking across the sky. The smell of spent
brass and burned powder. The rumble of BTR-82 armored personnel carriers
rolling through a narrow street. Rebels sprinting from building to
building through an open field of fire. These sights do not evoke a
striking imagine of a modern European country, but Russian posturing in
the region might lead to this. After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
international spectators believed this Eurasian military powerhouse
would cease. However, the Russian Federation has returned to its old
Cold War ways, [increasing
aggressive](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/030415_Pifer_Testimony.pdf)
activities against its neighbors in an attempt to stymie North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion. As seen with the annexation of
Crimea in 2014 or the liberation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the
2008 Georgian War, Russia has used its military to destabilize bordering
nations. Many leaders are worried that similar actions could be taken
against the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Unlike
Ukraine, these three countries are [a part
of](https://www.nato.int/cps/em/natohq/topics_52044.htm) NATO,
presenting a prime target for Russian president Vladimir Putin. However,
future aggression will likely come in the form of the hybrid warfare
attacks as seen in Ukraine and Georgia rather than an all-out invasion
[like many
think](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/if-you-want-peace-prepare-resistance%E2%80%9D-18480).
As Catherine Harris and Frederick Kagan from the Institute for the Study
of War [have hinted
at](http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Russian%20Ground%20Forces%20OOB_ISW%20CTP_0.pdf),
"The Russian military is well-positioned to launch a conventional war in
Ukraine and a hybrid war in the Baltic States, the opposite of what
Western leaders seem to be expecting in each theater." [Russia is simply
not prepared or properly positioned to execute a well-coordinated,
conventional attack on the Baltics. The amount of Russian units in close
proximity to make a rapid assault is limited, and most of these
formations would take significant time and resources to
mobilize]{.underline}. It would require a large and complex movement of
troops, vehicles, and equipment to successfully plan and execute such an
operation. Such activity would surely catch the eye of NATO members,
alerting them to a likely invasion. Instead, Russian posture is best
suited for hybrid warfare against these neighboring countries. [With the
Baltic States on Russia's Western border, the Western Military District
(WMD) \[Западный военный округ\] would be ultimately responsible for
Russian military operations in that region.]{.underline} These districts
are similar to the United States geographical combatant commands such as
European Command (EUCOM) and Central Command (CENTCOM), which have
separate units and command structures from multiple branches across
specific regions. [Russia's WMD contains all units permanently present
in the western-most part of the country while also including the enclave
of Kaliningrad bordering Poland and Lithuania. Although it is comprised
of naval, air, ground, cyber, electronic, and nuclear capabilities, the
number of assets in the region and their locations simply do not lend
themselves to making a surprise, conventional assault on the
Baltics.]{.underline} For instance, 2017
[figures](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2400/RR2402/RAND_RR2402.pdf)
show that there are twenty-two combat brigades and over 1,200 aircraft
within the vicinity of the Baltics, making it a very capable force.
However, these numbers do not tell the full story. [Hypothetically, if
Russia were to conduct a combined-arms invasion of the Baltic States
tomorrow, only a small number of forces would be properly positioned to
attack.]{.underline} There are plenty of armored and mechanized units
nearby, however, the only truly capable and quick reaction military unit
available for a surprise assault would be the 76th Guards Air Assault
Division (GAAD). Based in Pskov only twenty miles from the border of
Estonia, they could utilize cargo aircraft (e.g. Il-76), and helicopters
(e.g. Mi-8, Mi-17, and Mi-24) for airborne operations, striking the
Baltics with little warning. Additionally, it is reported that the GAAD
has recent [combat experience in
Ukraine](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/only-10-made-it-back-tapes-reveal-russias-secret-war-ws8vxchm36g).
This is an overlooked aspect when talking about the effectiveness of
armed forces. Size and equipment is not the only thing that determines a
unit's effectiveness. Recent tactical combat experience can also
increase lethality, something the GAAD now excels in. [Although speed
and experience is great, especially in a hypothetical Baltic campaign,
these air assault units simply do not have the heavy weaponry,
equipment, or logistics to maintain an offensive posture against NATO
combat units.]{.underline} They are outfitted for quick and rapid
deployments rather than sustained fighting with a superior force such as
a U.S. Army Armored Brigade Combat Team. To counter this, Russia would
have to mobilize their armored and mechanized forces, turning the
conflict into an even bigger conventional conflict, something Putin
knows would not fare well against American/NATO airpower. Instead, a
more predictable, logical, and less risky approach Russia might take
would be utilizing hybrid warfare tactics like they did against Ukraine
in the Crimea and the Donetsk region. By encouraging the ethnic Russian
speaking populations within the three Baltic countries to side with
Russia, Putin could supply these break off enclaves with weapons and
equipment to sustain a secessionist insurgency, like he did during the
Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. [If necessary, the GAAD could
provide very small, but direct support in a feigned attempt to protect
these ethnic Russians, as Russia did in the 2008 Georgian
War]{.underline}. With their expeditionary capability to deliver rapid
firepower in proximity of the Baltics, the GAAD would be perfectly
positioned for this type of deployment. This form of warfighting would
undermine the stability and capability of a NATO country and possibly
the viability of the alliance in the long-term; precisely what Putin
seeks.

### Failed State

#### Ukraine already a failed state---no impact

Recently a meeting took place in Washington among a group of U.S.
politicians including former Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair
Bob Corker and representatives of several Ukrainian civic organizations.
According to our source who wishes to not to be named, [the key
issue]{.underline} discussed during this meeting was the issue [of
national reconciliation as a solution for Ukraine]{.underline}, our
economically troubled ally in Eastern Europe. [Journalists were not
invited to the meeting because the Ukrainian representatives explained
that they were not interested in media coverage due to growing radical
movements and buildup of aggression in Ukrainian society.]{.underline}
Alternative points of view are summarily rejected in Ukraine, the civic
leaders explained. [It is well known that international financial
institutions are undertaking serious efforts in order to stabilize the
Ukraine economy and are pouring U.S. dollars into it. However, dizzying
corruption and unproductive expenditures for the war in Donbass make the
efforts of the international community seem wasteful. Instead of the
expected growth of internal GDP, the recent years have seen its steady
decline, as educated Ukrainians are fleeing their own
country.]{.underline} There is growing animosity between Ukraine and
Russia, which could lead to an escalation of armed conflict between the
two. If this were to happen, [Europe will be forced to take an active
role in the growing feud]{.underline}. In this regard, the Trump
administration and the State Department appreciate the need to resort to
new measures in order to counteract Ukraine's economic and political
death spiral. The first step to halt Ukraine's plummet into chaos should
be the process of reconciliation. It is unfortunate that Ukraine's
president, Petro Poroshenko, had taken the course towards legal
persecution of his political opponents. [This persecution is carried out
using utilitarian means counter to the rule of law. As a former Soviet
regime, Ukraine has a history of using its law enforcement institutions
to do its political bidding, relying on unsavory methods to reach
political objectives.]{.underline} In this regard, Ukraine and President
Poroshenko may not be alone, but given current geopolitical dynamics,
the stakes are particularly high for Ukraine and the United States. [The
courts]{.underline}, which are controlled by these politicians and
oligarchs, and, [are not truly independent, often render verdicts that
advance the agenda that is motivated by efforts to eliminate political
opponents rather than advance interests of justice or welfare of the
Ukrainian people]{.underline}. The current trial of the former
president, Victor Yanukovych, is an example of such extra-legal
execution. In Ukraine and now elsewhere it is often referred to as a
"parody of trial." The prosecution failed to produce any substantive
proof of guilt to the serious charges of treason. Yanukovych's American
and Ukrainian attorneys have documented the myriad of material
irregularities and flagrant disregard for process and the law. The
Ukrainian court has repeatedly violated the law and the rights of the
defendant, rejecting the pleas of his defense attorneys to carry out the
expert analysis of handwriting and to bring forth key witnesses for the
defense. The trial was concluded with disregard for Ukraine's rule of
law and universal principles of legal equity and human rights. The
defendant was even deprived of his right to deliver closing remarks. The
judges would not postpone the closing arguments at the request of
Yanukovych's lawyers due to his recent serious injury. Justice is often
tested at the outskirts during the toughest cases -- when it really
matters. The Yanukovych trial is an indication that [Ukraine's political
reforms are failing]{.underline}. A guilty verdict will be seen as
contrived, and regardless of Yanukovych's guilt or innocence, the
failures at the trial level will surely empower the former president to
appeal to Ukraine's Supreme Court, and subsequently to the European
Court of Human Rights, which may very well exonerate Yanukovych. The
U.S. politicians promised that materials related to this case will be
requested from the Obolon court of the city of Kyiv, and alleged
violations of human rights and rule of law will be vetted by Western
experts. According to open source and our contacts in the Republican
Party, the Trump administration is concerned about growing political
persecutions in Ukraine in light of upcoming presidential elections
there. Trials cannot be usurped to cater to personal political agenda of
any official, and this is a concern for a country that seeks to become a
full-fledged member of the European Union. Again, instead of political
vendettas, [Ukraine ought to focus on national reconciliation, stopping
the war in Donbass, restoring the economy and getting the country out of
its economic crisis]{.underline}. Today, [**Ukraine is** an ally of both
the U.S. and the EU, but it is also **a failed state at war with
Russia** and with itself]{.underline}. As part of the reconciliation, it
may be worthwhile to involve Yanukovych into the process of the
reconciliation in war-torn Donbass. Ukraine needs to bring Donbass home.
[The World Bank and the IMF also stress the importance of the Donbass
for economic growth of Ukraine]{.underline}. The Ukrainian
representatives stressed that the "experience of Victor Yanukovych and
the influence that he still wields possesses among the residents of
Donetsk and Luhansk regions could play a positive role ending the war
there." Last month, the Trump administration made private requests that
Ukraine considers getting the former president involved in the peace
process and that Ukraine adheres to human rights principles in its
administration of justice, referencing the Yanukovych trial as one that
is being watched. In late 2018, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of
Jerusalem Theophilos III [sent a letter to President Poroshenko with the
message of
reconciliation](https://www.jpost.com/Special-Content/Maximalism-of-Authorities-Pushes-Ukraine-Into-the-Past-575623),
calling upon President Poroshenko to terminate political persecution of
Yanukovych. He also asked that the former president be involved in the
process of peaceful settlement in the Donbass. Taking into account that
[the Minsk Agreement has reached a deadlock, and the level of negativity
in the Russia-Ukraine relations has been overwhelming]{.underline},
getting Yanukovych involved can be an effective option in reaching a
peaceful settlement salvaging Ukraine's national identity.

#### The Ukrainian economy is failing now due to the banking system---no spillover

**Aslund 19** \[Anders ÅSlund, a Swedish Econmist and a senior fellow at
the Atlantic Council, 04-29-2019, \"What Is Wrong with the Ukrainian
Economy?,\" Atlantic Council,

AK

Construction is booming in Kyiv, Ukraine, but not the rest of the
economy. A major reason is that Ukrainians with some extra savings do
not put their money into banks but buy additional apartments instead.
Others keep their savings in cash. On average, Ukrainian MPs keep
\$700,000 at home. Those who have a lot of wealth transfer it to
offshore havens, where the money is safe. [Ukraine is now the poorest
country in Europe. According to the International Monetary Fund, Ukraine
[overtook](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&ey=2024&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=55&pr1.y=10&c=921%2C926&s=NGDPDPC&grp=0&a=)
Moldova as the poorest country in Europe as measured in GDP per capita
in 2018 at \$2,963, 8 percent less than in Moldova.]{.underline} These
numbers can be boosted in many ways. Probably half of the Ukrainian
economy goes unreported in official statistics, and prices in Ukraine
are so low that one gets much more for a dollar there then elsewhere.
Still, the growth rate [has
been](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=50&pr.y=5&sy=2014&ey=2024&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=926&s=NGDP_RPCH&grp=0&a=)
around 3 percent a year for the last three years, and the IMF predicts a
similar rate even for the long term. A poor country with macroeconomic
stability and open access to the large European market should be growing
steadily by 7 percent annually. What is wrong? Usually the discussion
focuses on what the state does, but there's a better way to understand
how the economy really functions: follow the money. Ukraine has a steady
net capital outflow of about 4 percent of GDP each year. Foreigners see
what is going on, and real foreign direct investment has been as little
as 1 percent of GDP for the last five years. Naturally, the war has
scared many away, but that is hardly the main reason why FDI remains
flat. Instead, Ukraine should have FDI of 4-5 percent of GDP. Then the
investment ratio would not be 20 percent of GDP but 28-30 percent of
GDP, which is the difference between 3 and 7 percent growth. There is
little or no financing available for business. By and large, business
investment is based on retained earnings. Since 2014, the National Bank
of Ukraine (NBU) has closed 100 of the then 180 commercial banks. In
many cases, the owners of the bank had taken most of the loans, and
large deposit holders lost their money. In other cases, the banks
specialized in money laundering, and some functioned just like holding
companies. But [the banking system has not been cured. Because of the
many bank failures, state banks now account for 58 percent of all
banking assets. Interest rates are prohibitively high]{.underline}. The
NBU just cut its interest rate to 17.5 percent a year, while inflation
is just over 8 percent. The lowest commercial borrowing rates in hryvnia
are 22 percent, which means that the real interest rate is at least 14
percent a year. [That is far too high for investment, so bank loans are
not financing investment. In spite of very high deposit rates, banks do
not attract many deposits either. The banks' primary problem is that
their biggest clients do not pay. In total, non-performing loans in the
Ukrainian banking system are more than 50 percent. The reason is that
Ukraine has a few hundred people who consider themselves too superior to
pay, and unfortunately the Ukrainian judiciary agrees. In particular,
427 members of parliament enjoy legal immunity and probably two-thirds
of them are businessmen.]{.underline} Others have simply very good
relations with the relevant parts of the law enforcement apparatus.
European elites behaved like that in the 18th century. It was only in
the 19th century when the playing field was levelled that Europe started
growing. Herein lies the critical shortcoming of the Ukrainian economy.
[First, parliamentary immunity has to be abolished. People should join
the parliament to become politicians, not businessmen. Second, Ukraine
needs to redo the failed judicial reform so that all Supreme Court
judges can be verified as honest people.]{.underline} The same is true
of the general prosecutor's office. The Security Service of Ukraine
(SBU) must no longer deal with economic crimes. Its 8,000 or so officers
that work in that department should be laid off. Most of them have
earned more than they will need for their retirement. [Third, the best
collateral for a bank loan is land or real estate. However, today
agricultural land cannot be used as collateral, because of the
moratorium on private land sales. If that is finally lifted, the banks
could give far more credit to agriculture, which could double its
output. Then, banks could start to function normally and attract both
capital and deposits. The market would bring down interest rates. The
state banks could attract investors and be privatized.]{.underline} If
property in Ukraine would be deemed safe, capital outflows would dwindle
and instead be invested in the Ukrainian economy. Foreigners would see
the transformation and want to join the Ukrainian growth party.

[Russia's growing global activism raises the questions of how and when
the United States should respond]{.underline}. [Given Moscow's emergence
as a serious adversary]{.underline}, the severe strains in the
U.S.-Russian relationship, and Russia's toxicity in U.S. domestic
politics, the Trump administration is likely to come under pressure to
respond whenever and wherever Moscow seeks to expand its influence.
However, [it would be a mistake to see every instance of Russian global
activism, wherever it occurs, as a threat to the U.S.-led international
order or the United States itself]{.underline}. [The impulse to respond
by seeking to prevent the proverbial dominoes from falling should be
tempered by an assessment of how Russia's actions affect U.S. foreign
policy goals, interests, and priorities]{.underline}. Ignoring or
downplaying Russian activities when a firm response is warranted will
only encourage and embolden Moscow to act more aggressively. But
[overreacting to Russian actions could exacerbate regional tensions and
make conflicts more difficult to resolve or to deescalate. The creation
of a new Cold War dynamic would provide a political boost to the
Kremlin's legitimacy]{.underline} at home and a shot in the arm to the
domestic Russian constituencies that stand to benefit from conflict with
the West. Judgment, patience, and restraint will be required. In short,
the overarching question is this: Does Russia's growing global activism
represent a temporary, expedient tactical response to manage and counter
specific U.S. activities, or a more enduring, systematic reorientation
of Russia's foreign policy toward achieving long-term strategic and
geopolitical goals at the West's expense? Depending on the
circumstances, the exact nature of the U.S. response to Russian
activities will vary, particularly the tools---diplomatic, economic,
informational, and military---that Washington and its partners employ.
These determinations should therefore be judged on a case-by-case basis.
Before deciding on a specific response, U.S. policymakers need to
address the following questions about the scope, nature, and
consequences of particular Russian activities and potential
countermeasures so as to help inform these choices: What interests is
Moscow seeking to advance and what goals is it seeking to achieve? What
U.S. interests and objectives, if any, are being threatened? How much
relative weight does each country give to their respective interests?
What policy tools is Russia employing to achieve its ends? How effective
and how costly is Moscow's use of these means? What new and existing
policy tools, if any, can and should the United States and its partners
use unilaterally or multilaterally to build up resilience at home and
abroad and to counter Russian influence? How effective and how costly
are these countermeasures? How is Moscow likely to respond to various
U.S. countermeasures? What are the prospects for managing the risks of
escalation and other unforeseen consequences? While Russia did not cause
and will not solve many of the problems and challenges confronting a
large swath of the world, Moscow will continue to seek to exploit them
for its own narrow gain, and its involvement could make them worse.
Nonetheless, to paraphrase former U.S. president John Quincy Adams,
[Washington should not go abroad looking for Russian bears to destroy
every time Moscow makes a move]{.underline}.82 In most cases of Russian
interference in the political systems and institutions of democratic

activities should only be implemented when the Kremlin's actions
threaten important U.S. and allied interests, and when Washington has
realistic, practical, and sustainable means to thwart Russian ambitions
without making a given situation worse]{.underline}.

### IR Theory Good---Multipolar World

#### The struggle of a multipolar world necessitates an understanding of the historical and existing structures of IR theory

Theory Talks; 12-03-**[[2010]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**;

[Another scenario is also emerging: a continuation of the struggle for
global domination]{.underline}, I think a prevailing term on the
American side is 'full spectrum dominance', pitting US led forces
against the potential consolidation of Eurasian power. This is the old
geopolitical vision of Halford Mackinder: a heartland consisting of
Eurasia, the world island, encircled by the now American-led periphery.
The war on terror, first started by the Bush administration and now
continued by Obama, renews the American imperative for world dominance.
This leads logically to a coming together of the continent of Eurasia,
to confront what Eurasians perceive as the attempt of the US to achieve
world dominance by encirclment. The conflicts that now exist in the
Middle East---Yemen, Iran, Afghanistan---are symptomatic of this,
including the growing reservations of some European countries to the
role of the periphery's military alliance, NATO. [There is an
alternative organization, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, linking
Russia, China, and the Central Asian Republics, which in effect would
join together Eurasia as a potential counterbalance to NATO. I think the
biggest challenge is the relative decline of the US in relation to the
rest of the world and whether and how America will adjust to a world in
which it can no longer presume to lead]{.underline}. I think this is
extremely difficult for American society and American politicians[. The
role of developing this new historical structure, by the actors within
it, is to build a context for action which shapes thinking about what is
possible for those living through it.]{.underline} This engenders a
'common sense' about reality that can endure for a long time, as
previous historical structures have shown. This is what Fernand Braudel
called the 'longue durée'. [A historical structure in the minds of
historical actors may seem fixed, but the historian can subsequently see
it as being in mutation, gradually sometimes or more suddenly in others.
So probably the biggest challenge is the challenge to
America]{.underline}. The rest of the world is showing some ability to
understand and to be party to an adjustment to a new world order---but
will America understand? That's the big problem, because the rest of the
world is ready to adapt provided the US takes a lead towards
understanding its role as that of one great power amongst others. The
moment Obama got elected was a moment that represented the possibility
of such a change in American society, yet one year later, in terms of
international relations, he has appointed all the people associated with
the previous administration. So while there is now, because of Obama, a
difference in the mode of expression of American power (Obama is much
more sympathetic to the rest of the world than the rather aggressively
dominant Bush/Cheney presidency), that power is directed in the same way
as before. The US still has over seven hundred military bases around the
world which seem to the rest of the world as encirclement. Now [compare
this to Britain's position after the Second World War. Britain was no
longer able to sustain its position as a world leader and adopted a
policy of withdrawal.]{.underline} It could do so because of the idea of
a 'special relationship' with the US, which effectively meant turning
over problems of international security to the United States. So in
structural terms, nothing changed much at that moment in terms of
dominance in world order, but Britain managed to adopt to its new role.
Now back to the present: with Obama, [many people expected an
international politics of withdrawal]{.underline}: a big part of his
support came from the idea that he was the anti-war candidate--- he even
received the Nobel Peace Prize. But, in accepting his prize, he somewhat
apologetically defended fighting his wars. And this straitjacket of war
in which Obama finds himself, this seeming determinism regarding the
role of the US in the contemporary world order, has major implications
for domestic social forces and is called into question by the crisis in
the world economy.

### IR Theory Good---Critical Analysis

#### IR theory is necessary for critical analysis to comprehend the structures of power and how alternatives can exist to combat them

P. **[[Schouten]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, "Theory Talk #37", pg. 5;

[Problem solving takes the world as it is and focuses on correcting
certain dysfunctions, certain specific problems. Critical theory is
concerned with how the world, that is all the conditions that problem
solving theory takes as the given framework, may be changing. Because
problem solving theory has to take the basic existing power
relationships as given, it will be biased towards perpetuating those
relationships, thus tending to make the existing order
hegemonic.]{.underline} What [critical theory]{.underline} does, is
[question these very structural conditions that are tacit assumptions
for problem-solving theory, to ask whom and which purposes such theory
serves]{.underline}. [It looks at the facts that problem-solving theory
presents from the inside, that is, as they are experienced by actors in
a context which also consists of power relations]{.underline}. [Critical
theory thus historicizes world orders by uncovering the purposes problem
solving theories within such an order serve to uphold. By uncovering the
contingency of an existing world order, one can then proceed to think
about different world orders.]{.underline} It is more marginal than
problem solving theory since it does not comfortably provide policy
recommendations to those in power. What I meant is that there is no
theory for itself; theory is always for someone, for some purpose.
[There is no neutral theory concerning human affairs, no theory of
universal validity]{.underline}. [Theory derives from practice and
experience, and experience is related to time and place. Theory is a
part of history. It addresses the problematic of the world of its time
and place]{.underline}. An inquirer has to aim to place himself above
the historical circumstances in which a theory is propounded. [One has
to ask about the aims and purposes of those who construct theories in
specific historical situations.]{.underline} Broadly speaking, for any
theory, there are two possible purposes to serve. One is for guiding the
solving of problems posed within the particular context, the existing
structure. This leads to a problem-solving form of theory, which takes
the existing context as given and seeks to make it work better. The
other which I call [critical theory is more reflective on the processes
of change of historical structures, upon the transformation or
challenges arising within the complex of forces constituting the
existing historical structure, the existing 'common sense' of reality.
Critical thinking then contemplates the possibility of an
alternative.]{.underline}

### IR Epistemology Good---Analytical Eclecticism

Approach to IR Theory", pg. 2-3; doi
[10.1093/isr/viv003](https://doi.org/10.1093/isr/viv003) JEJP

The earliest systematic effort to generate a pragmatist movement in IR
is found in a 2002 special issue of Millennium devoted to exploring the
potential of pragmatist scholarship to transcend the IR "paradigm wars"
of the 1990s. As the editorial preface to the issue states, "Looking
beyond the epistemological stalemate opposing positivism and
post-positivism, [Pragmatism invokes a methodological pluralism and
disciplinary tolerance \[and\] encourages a multi-perspectival style of
inquiry that privileges practice and benefits from the complementarity,
rather than opposition, of different understandings of world
politics]{.underline}" (Bauer and Brighi 2002, 111). Most contributors
echo this line. Cochran focuses on its contingent and perspectival
character. [Pragmatist knowledge claims, she states, are axiological
rather than nomological, "illuminat\[ing\] the logical relationships
between events or actions, and the consequences that follow from
particular principles and understandings]{.underline}" (Cochran 2002,
537). [Hass and Hass argue that pragmatist epistemology offers a strong
foundation for constructivist "middle-range" theorizing by permitting
the essential separation of "brute facts," as facets of reality amenable
to consensus knowledge, "social facts," as statements about social life
that derive largely from the thoughts of observers, and "hybrid facts,"
as the implications of some "brute facts" upon society]{.underline}
(2002, 590). Festenstein (2002) identifies [four tenets as central to
pragmatist epistemology: holism, fallibilism, antiskepticism, and the
ontological centrality of practices.]{.underline} While other
contributors to this issue, such as Iver Neumann, do pay more attention
to ontology---and I will discuss their work presently---this attention
is secondary to an examination of pragmatism as it relates to the status
of knowledge-claims. As noted earlier, [the best-known attempt to apply
pragmatist epistemology to IR likely is "analytical
eclecticism"]{.underline} (Katzenstein and Sil 2008; Sil and Katzenstein
2010). Katzenstein and Sil locate pragmatist theories of knowledge in [a
middleground between objectivism and subjectivism]{.underline}, and draw
upon Dewey, James, Peirce, and Mead to argue that [IR scholarship should
not be bound into particular schools of thought]{.underline}.
[Analytical eclecticism "proceeds at least implicitly on the basis of a
pragmatist ethos, manifested concretely in the search for middle range
theoretical arguments \... in contrast to more narrowly parsed research
puzzles designed to test theories or fill in gaps within research
traditions"]{.underline} (Sil and Katzenstein 2010, 412[). They draw
extensively upon the pragmatist philosopher of science Larry Laudan's
concept of the "research tradition" (1978) to describe the current state
of the field and propose to dis-embed scholarship from such traditions
in favor of the search for causal mechanisms: by focusing only on
certain kinds of mechanisms and ignoring or defining away others,
adherents of research traditions risk missing the complex processes
through which diverse mechanisms relate to one another.]{.underline} To
offset this risk, [analytic eclecticism is predicated on a definition of
mechanism \... as all entities---whether individual actions or choices,
social relations or networks, environmental or institutional
characteristics, specific events or contextual factors, individual
cognitive dispositions or collectively shared ideas and
worldviews---that generate immediate effects through processes that may
or may not recur across contexts and that may be, but often are not,
directly observable]{.underline}. [Such a definition \... permit\[s\]
traveling across diverse theoretical terrain to enable consideration of
multiple causal forces operating in different domains of reality and
across levels of generality. (Sil and Katzenstein 2010,
421)]{.underline}

### IR Epistemology Good---Takes into account culture

#### All criticisms of IR theory have been based on that which is non-core---US-Russian relations are core and therefore outside of that scope

A **[[Makarychev &]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** V

[10.1111/misr.12067](https://doi.org/10.1111/misr.12067) JEJP

[In the recent decades, the discipline of International Relations (IR)
has become very sensitive to the fact that all knowledge is rooted in a
particular culture, and thus, seemingly universal theories and concepts
might have limited validity in a non-Western context]{.underline}.
Originating in the postcolonial critique of Eurocentrism (Said 1978), as
well as in the related renunciation of rationalist epistemology by
constructivist scholars (Lapid 1989; Smith 1995), this debate has
produced intense interest in national schools of IR outside of the
Western core (Lebedeva 2004; Wæver and Tickner 2009; Acharya 2011). This
interest is in our view fully justified both in the case of the social
sciences in general and of IR in particular. [IR is explicitly focused
on interactions across all sorts of boundaries and thus must pay
particular attention to the domestic background of foreign
policy]{.underline}. [Academic debates, with all their national
peculiarities, form an important component of this
background]{.underline}. At the same time, there is a tendency to assign
certain value to non-Western national schools of IR even before their
contribution to the global debate is evaluated. We disagree with this
attitude. In our view, [it is fully legitimate to argue that global
diversity cannot be reduced to Western experience]{.underline}, but
[claiming that this diversity can be understood only through local forms
of knowledge]{.underline} is a much more radical argument, which
[entails numerous problems]{.underline}. The case in point can be
summarized using a two-dimensional matrix (see Table 1[). The first
dimension is ontological. It differentiates between the view of the
world as one, where all developments are governed by uniform laws, and
the opposite perspective, in which pluralism is irreducible: we can
generalize up to a limit, but ultimately still have to deal with
multiple worlds. The second dimension is epistemological: here, we
contrast two approaches to knowledge production. The interpretation of
science as a unity in diversity assumes that despite the existence of
diverging research programs, all of them at some level are in dialogue
with each other.]{.underline} In the final analysis, [rational cognition
can and must progress according to the same rules of scholarly
communication, which ensure the validity of results.]{.underline} The
opposite view holds that rationality is always conditioned by culture,
and therefore, different "national schools" and "local knowledges" are
not necessarily compatible. [We argue that the tendency to uncritically
assign value to "non-core" theorizing confuses these two dimensions and
explore the origins and implications of this confusion using
contemporary Russian IR as our empirical case]{.underline}. [The axiom
(faulty or not) that Russia is different from the West is often
interpreted by Russian scholars to the effect that "Western" theory is
incapable of accounting for this uniqueness, and therefore, the Russian
academic community needs to develop specifically Russian social
theory]{.underline}. This tendency is particularly visible in Russian
IR---as we see it, for two main reasons. The first is not specific to
Russia: [IR as a discipline is structured by the definition of the
international as pluralist]{.underline}. [Looking for alternative
theories is a popular way to account for this plurality]{.underline}.
The second reason is characteristic of Russia, with its identity as a
non-Western great power (Neumann 2008). In the Russian context, the idea
of global ontological pluralism is often expressed through the concept
of multipolarity. Russian scholars, along with political leaders, often
refer [to multipolarity as the emerging new pattern of IR]{.underline},
hailing its alleged arrival as a welcome alternative to Western
dominance (Makarychev and Morozov 2011). Quite often, however, they do
not stop at the ontological level and go on to [endow the concept with
epistemological significance, arguing that in a multipolar world,
Russian social theory must develop on its own terms, independently of
"Western" theories.]{.underline}

### Policy Simulation Good

#### Scenario building is good for predicting new events and coming up with alternative futures

**[[Han 11]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}** (Dong-ho Han, June 2011,
Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security,
http://kaisnet.or.kr/resource/down/9_1_02.pdf)

In the field of IR a few scholars have reevaluated the importance of
scenario analysis as a social science methodology.37) These scholars
contend that [the scenario-building method could make a unique
contribution to IR research because of the alternatives to a
"scientific" approach it offers to mainstream IR
theorizing]{.underline}. Janis Gross Stein and her colleagues' work on
the future of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict is a good example of the
scenario methodology in 35) Allen Hammond, Which World?: Scenarios for
the 21st Century (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1998), p. 14. 36)
Ibid., p. 14. 37) Relevant works are Steven Weber, op. cit., pp.
167-179; Janis Gross Stein, et al., "Five Scenarios in the
Israel-Palestinian Relationship in 2002," Security Studies 7-4 (1998),
pp. 195-208; Steven Bernstein, et al., op. cit., pp. 43-76. For a recent
effort to explain scenario analysis in reference to regional affairs,
see Ayse Betul Celik and Andrew Blum, "Future Uncertain: Using Scenarios
to Understand Turkey's Geopolitical Environment and its Impact on the
Kurdish Question," Ethnopolitics 6-4 (November 2007), pp. 569-583. 50
The Korean Journal of International Studies 9-1, June 2011 practice. In
1998, these scholars tried to clarify the trends surrounding future
Israeli-Palestinian relations, using forward reasoning and scenario
construction. In the process of applying scenario methodology they
produced five scenarios regarding the future of the Israel-Palestinian
relationship based on such factors as negotiated agreement, the status
quo, and Palestinian independence or autonomy. They posited that the
domestic political structure of Israel is a key component in determining
the future of the IsraeliPalestinian relationship in the region.38) For
instance, one of their scenarios no negotiated settlement, territorial
status quo, and Palestinian autonomy is based on the combinations among
deteriorating Israeli public opinion on the prospect of the peace
process with the Palestinian authority, Palestinian leaders' decision to
use violence against Israel with support from Hamas elements in domestic
politics, and subsequent justification of non-dealing with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of the Likud government of Israel.
These scholars' scenario construction work is dependent on indentifying
domestic political factors in Israel and Palestine and their
interactions regarding the Israel-Palestinian relationship. A key
speculation from this group comes from their diverse theoretical
perspectives and their regional expertise, which make it possible to
think about the future in a more systematic way. After producing several
scenarios, this group of IR scholars notes, [The scenarios]{.underline}
themselves [make clear that there are connections among the stories,
that the plot lines can flow through one another. These scenarios do not
represent sealed universes, but interconnected contingent worlds, where
forces can drive the process from one scenario to another. We need to
identify these loops and links, and specify as clearly as possible the
kinds of forces and contingencies that would move the relationship from
one path to another.]{.underline}39) By emphasizing the
interconnectedness of factors and their outcomes these IR scholars have
shown the practical use of the scenario method with a real world
example. Another recent example in the field would be Celik and Blum's
scenariobased analysis of Turkey's security environment and its impact
on the Kurdish question. Concerning the future of Turkey, they posited
four scenarios: stable pluralism, peaceful polarization, the internal
struggle, and competing nationalisms. These scenario outcomes are based
on the discussions on such factors as the impact of both the EU access
process and developments in northern Iraq.40) By showing a clear impact
of the EU process and the existence of Kurds in northern Iraq on
Turkey's future political landscape with respect to the resolution of
the Kurd question, Celik and Blum effectively extrapolated the evolving
dynamics of different ethnic groups and their interactions in the
Turkish state and its adjacent region using scenario terms. Given this
backdrop, [using the scenario method into the IR field has important
implications for the development of innovative methodologies to predict
world events. This rationale is all the more relevant in the field given
the failure of the prediction of the end of the Cold War twenty years
ago. After observing the abrupt end of the Cold War, Cold War historian
John Lewis Gaddis pointed out that "we tend to bias our historical and
our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity\... we rarely find a
way to introduce discontinuities into theory, or to attempt to determine
what causes them to happen]{.underline}."41) How can we solve the
problem of the difficulty even the impossibility of predicting important
world events while still preserving some progress of our "scientific"
theory development in the discipline? In the conclusion of his 1992
article, Gaddis noted that "[good scientists\... make use of all the
tools at their disposal in trying to anticipate the future. That
includes not just theory, observation, and rigorous calculation, but
also narrative, analogy, paradox, irony, intuition, imagination, and not
least in importance style]{.underline}."42) [Even if he does not clearly
use terms like scenario method or scenario construction, Gaddis seems to
have an idea similar to scenario thinking when he mentions important
tools to enable us to make an every effort to anticipate the future.
Among several factors that contribute to scenario making, imagination,
for example, plays a crucial role in making sense of futures
studies]{.underline}, although it has long been ignored by "traditional"
social science research programs[. Kahn emphasizes the role of
imagination, arguing that imagination "has always been one of the
principal means for dealing in various ways with the future, and the
scenario is simply one of many devices useful in stimulating and
disciplining the imagination."]{.underline}43) With the power of
imagination, thinking about all plausible and relevant factors in
preparation for an unknown future seems to be all the more important
given the increasing nature of uncertainty in future world politics.44)
[Proponents of the scenario method suggest forward reasoning as a useful
tool in making scenarios of future events in international
politics.]{.underline} However, [the emphasis on forward reasoning does
not necessarily mean that scenario thinking simply ignores the lessons
of the past. Rather, by emphasizing looking forward, scenario analysis
enables policy makers to "march into the future looking backward, guided
by the accumulated lessons of past experience."]{.underline}45)
Similarly, [some IR scholars assert the advantage of forward reasoning
thinking forwardly "opens our analyses to the possibilities of
alternative futures, but forces discipline in tracing likely paths
created by important drivers in combination with significant
uncertainties"]{.underline}46) It is critical to distinguish between
important driving forces which mostly make a course of future events and
some uncertainties which are important yet impossible to figure out at
the present moment. Given this backdrop, [advocates for scenario
analysis in the discipline argue that analyzing critical unknowns and
assessing different possibilities are becoming more and more essential
in studying international politics.]{.underline}

### Turn---Plan Solves Russophobia

#### Plan solves Russophobia by providing a pathway to understand Putin's purpose for action

age of liberal decline,\"

JEJP

The era of great hopes and expectations generated by the end of the Cold
War has given way to an emotionally bitter conflict of values between
the United States and Russia. [Since 2012 at the latest, it has become
common to hear American and Russian media accusing the leaders of their
respective countries not only of violating international law, but also
of developing political systems based on cynicism, injustice, and
disregard for human dignity]{.underline}. On many occasions, US
officials and members of the political class have compared the actions
of Vladimir Putin with those of Adolf Hitler and portrayed the Kremlin's
style of government as being deeply corrupt and based on the repression
of opposition, the reward of political cronies, and on military
aggression abroad. Russia, meanwhile, sees itself as defending its
political system and legitimate interests from economic, political and
military interference by the West. Comments by Russian officials
indicate that they do not hold in high regard the institutions of
competitive elections, the free media and the market economy. On the
contrary, they believe that these serve as a cover for narrowly based
yet excessively powerful special interest
groups.[1](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-1)
Under President Donald Trump, US--Russian relations have entered a new
phase. Trump's election revealed a major value divide within American
society. Whereas Trump's opponents have remained committed to world
order based on liberal institutionalist ideas, the US president favours
a return to military strength, unilateralism and economic nationalism.
During the election campaign, he took issue with liberal
characterizations of Russia as an 'enemy' to be contained and argued for
lifting sanctions and partnering with Moscow in the area of
counter-terrorism. This has caused the liberal media to attack Trump as
a semi-autocratic proxy of
Putin.[2](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-2) Ideologically,
Trump's views bear some similarity with those of Putin and stress strong
executive power and primacy in international
affairs.[3](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-3)
The Russia issue has become central in the new internal divide between
the Trump administration and the liberal establishment. To a significant
extent, the divide reflects the latter's frustration with the loss of
elections and the respective share of political influence. Some
neoconservative groups within the Republican Party have also been
critical of Trump's Russia views for their own political
reasons.[4](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-4) However,
if the two countries are to move beyond viewing each other as potential
enemies, they must find a way to reframe their values in
non-confrontational terms. [The election of Trump as US president has
prompted the liberal media to actively discuss new Russia-related fears
and conspiracy theories. Two such fears have been that alleged Russian
cyber interference in the US elections amounted to an act of war and
that Putin was now ruling America through his proxies. Members of the US
political class endorsed these views and helped to spread the fears.
**The question of Russia's motives, even if one assumes that meddling
took place, was never seriously
explored**]{.underline}.[5](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-5)
The first fear likely came to the media from Hillary Clinton's inner
circle. The liberal New Yorker claimed that members of the circle
believed that the Obama administration deliberately downplayed the DNC
hacking by the Kremlin. 'We understand the bind they were in,' one of
Clinton's senior advisers said. 'But what if Barack Obama had gone to
the Oval Office, or the East Room of the White House, and said, "I'm
speaking to you tonight to inform you that the United States is under
attack..." A large majority of Americans would have sat up and taken
notice. ... It is bewildering -- it is baffling -- it is hard to make
sense of why this was not a five-alarm fire in the White
House'.[6](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-6) Commentators
and pundits, including those with academic and political credentials,
further developed the theory of the US under enemy attack[. The former
ambassador to Russia, Michael
McFaul,[7](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-7) wrote
in The Washington Post that Russia attacked 'our sovereignty' and
continues to 'watch us do nothing' because of partisan divides. He
compared the Kremlin's actions with Pearl Harbour or 9/11 and warned
that Russia was likely to repeat assaults in 2018 or
2020]{.underline}.[8](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-8) The
historian Timothy Snyder went even further by linking the 'war' with the
election of Trump, which he claimed was the basic aim of the
enemy.[9](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-9)
[Rather than viewing the hacking attacks as interference in domestic
affairs, both Democrats and Republicans helped to promote the war
theory]{.underline}. Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee
John McCain stated, 'When you attack a country, it's an act of
war'.[10](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-10) Former
vice president Dick Cheney called Russia's alleged interference in the
US election 'a very serious effort made by Putin and his government, his
organization', pointing out that 'in some quarters that would be
considered an act of
war'.[11](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-11) [Without
calling for a military response, a number of Democrats also engaged in
war rhetoric; Senator Ben Cardin, for example, referred to the Russia
'attack' as a 'political Pearl
Harbour']{.underline}.[12](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-12)
The war rhetoric fits into a larger narrative developed by Democrats and
liberal media, in which Trump is presented as being compromised by
Russia and soft on the Kremlin. Writing in the New York Times on 14
February 2017, [Thomas L. Friedman called for retaliation against
Russia]{.underline} and praised the 'patriotic' Republican senators John
McCain and Lindsey Graham for being tough on
Trump.[13](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-13) During
her broadcast on 9 March, [MSNBC host Rachel Maddow asked whether Trump
was actually under Putin's control. Citing Trump's views, as well as
examples of his associates travelling to Moscow, she told viewers that
'we are starting to see what may be signs of continuing \[Russian\]
influence in our country]{.underline}. Not just during the campaign but
during the administration. Basically, signs of what could be continuing
operation.'[14](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-14) On
23 March, another New York Times writer, Nicholas Kristof, published a
column entitled 'There's a Smell of Treason in the Air.' In it, he
argued that the FBI investigation into 'whether another presidential
campaign colluded with a foreign power so as to win an election ...
would amount to treason.' Responding to Trump's statement that his phone
was tapped during the election campaign, the Washington Post columnist
Anne Applebaum tweeted that 'Trump's insane "GCHQ tapped my phone"
theory came from...
Moscow.'[15](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-15) McFaul
and many others then endorsed and retweeted the message. Before that,
members of the US establishment had on numerous occasions accused Russia
and Kremlin-connected oligarchs of collusion with Trump's officials.
This then became a part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's
investigation, although the political connection to the Kremlin has not
yet been proven. The liberal media fed off discussions, investigations
and conspiracy theories about Russia within the political class and
expert community in Washington. Much of what was written was based on
rumours and mysterious leaks, possibly by members of the US intelligence
community, claiming improper ties between Trump and
Putin,[16](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-16) as
well as on the activities of liberal groups seeking to discredit Trump.
For example, on 22 February
2017, [politico.com](http://politico.com/) reported that the
Clinton-influenced Center for American Progress had brought in a former
State Department official to run a new 'Moscow Project', while
advocating the creation of an investigation into Trump's ties to
Russia.[17](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-17) Many
of the suspicions of Russian interference, including concerning the DNC
hacking, were based on allegations of potentially 'compromising'
behaviour on the part of Trump: praise of Putin, possible business
dealings with Russian oligarchs, Trump's former campaign manager Paul
Manafort's advisory ties to the deposed Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovich, a 'black dossier' on Trump held by the Kremlin, compiled by
an unidentified British intelligence officer and leaked to CNN, and the
resignation of National Security adviser General Michael Flynn for not
disclosing his contacts with Russian
representatives.[18](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-18)
Taken together, all these things implied Kremlin interference in US
domestic politics; viewed separately, however, each was questionable.
Some of the charges could have also been directed at Hillary Clinton,
who also has ties to Russian -- not to mention Saudi Arabian -- business
circles and Ukrainian politicians. Other charges concerned political
views and could not be counted as evidence. Still others, such as the
'black dossier', could have been a
fabrication.[19](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-19) Even
the CIA and the FBI-endorsed conclusion about Russia attacking the DNC
servers was questioned by some observers on the grounds of the
intelligence agencies' over-reliance on findings by one cybersecurity
company, CrowdStrike.  The International Institute for Strategic
Studies, which provided the data used by CrowdStrike, later stated that
the data was used erroneously and could not serve as proof of
hacking.[20](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-20)
[The politicized nature of the debate, the circulation of questionable
leaks and dossiers compiled by unidentified individuals, and the lack of
serious evidence, led many independent observers to conclude that the
Russia story was more about Trump than Russia]{.underline}. Mueller's
investigation became increasingly focused on Trump associates' business
ties with Russia, as well as other violations of the law such as lying
about their conversations with Russia's
ambassador.[21](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-21) The
Russia scandal was symptomatic of the poisonous state of relations
between the US and Russia. The Democrats exploited this for derailing
Trump, who during the election campaign had advocated normalization with
the Kremlin. In other words, US--Russia relations have become a hostage
of partisan domestic politics. As one liberal and tough critic of Putin
wrote, Democratic lawmakers' rhetoric of war 'places Republicans -- who
often characterize themselves as more hawkish on Russia and defence --
in a bind as they try to defend to the new administration's strategy
towards
Moscow'.[22](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-22) As
Jesse Walker, an editor at Reason magazine and the author of The United
States of Paranoia, pointed out, There's a difference between thinking
that Moscow may have hacked the Democratic National Committee and
thinking that Moscow actually hacked the election, between thinking the
president may have Russian conflicts of interest and thinking he's a
Russian puppet ... When someone like the New York Times columnist Paul
Krugman declares that Putin 'installed' Donald Trump as president, he's
moving out of the realm of plausible plots and into the world of
fantasy. Similarly, Clinton's warning that Trump could be Putin's
'puppet' leaped from an imaginable idea, that Putin wanted to help her
rival, to the much more dubious notion that Putin thought he could
control the impulsive Trump. (Trump barely seems capable of controlling
himself.)[23](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-23)
There were two sides to the Russia story in the liberal discourse --
rational and emotional. The rational side had to do with the pooling of
resources by Clinton-affiliated circles and other anti-Russian groups in
order to undermine Trump and his plans to improve relations with Russia.
These resources included dominance within the liberal media and leaks by
unidentified members of the intelligence community. The emotional side
was the liberal elites' ability to engage with fears of Russia within
the US political class and the general public, which to a certain extent
went back to old Cold War memories. Partly due to these memories,
minority elites such as the one associated with Clinton were successful
in evoking in the public liberal mind what historian Richard Hofstadter
called the 'paranoid style' or 'the sense of heated exaggeration,
suspiciousness, and conspiratorial
fantasy'.[24](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-24) Mobilized
by liberal media, Russophobia became an independent factor in the
political struggle inside Washington. The public display of fear and
frustration with Russia and Trump could only be sustained by a constant
supply of new 'suspicions' and their intense discussion by the media.
[Paranoia about Russia in the liberal media was symptomatic of America's
declining confidence in its own values]{.underline}. Following the
terrorist attack on 11 September 2001, the disastrous war in Iraq, and
the global financial crisis of 2008, US and European nations have been
searching for ways to adapt to a new, increasingly unstable and
regionalized world. The United States is now divided internally. In
November 2016, following the presidential elections, 77 per cent of
Americans perceived their country to be 'greatly divided on the most
important
values'.[25](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-25) Following
the war in Iraq, US leadership could no longer inspire the same respect,
and a growing number of countries viewed it as a threat to world
peace.[26](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-26) In
response, the United States has moved away from trying to win hearts and
minds, towards developing 'digital' and financial tools for engaging
foreign activists and monitoring foreign governments. The power of
example has increasingly been replaced with assertiveness, surveillance
and bribery. This lack of confidence was reflected in the exaggerated
fear that Russia was capable of destroying the West's values. Yet
neither Russia nor Putin were omnipresent or threatening to destroy the
United States' political system. Mark Lawrence Schrad described fears of
Russia as 'increasingly hysterical fantasies' and argued against viewing
Russia as the global menace. Russis, he argued, is a political system
that combines democratic and non-democratic characteristics, whose
varied strategic interests deserve recognition and respectful
engagement.[27](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-27)
If the Kremlin was indeed behind the cyberattacks, it was not for the
reasons it was accused of. Rather than trying to subvert the US system,
it was seeking to defend its own system against what it perceived as the
US global policy of regime change and internal meddling -- a policy that
has a long history in the second half of the twentieth
century.[28](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-28) However,
unlike during the Cold War, the contemporary global struggle is not for
communism or capitalism, but for the assertion of global rules and
regulations that favour different states. The Washington establishment
assumes that America defines the rules of proper behaviour in
international politics, while others simply follow those rules. [The
narrative of Russia as threatening neo-Soviet autocracy has been
instrumental in confirming the identity of America as leader of the
'free world'. The narrative is successful in part because old Cold War
views have not been replaced by a different understanding of the new
realities. Following the election of Trump, Russia's otherness served to
preserve the confidence of the liberal self]{.underline}. In addition,
the United States continues to be guided by the geopolitical objective
of remaining the sole superpower, something that also requires an image
of the external other. As Anatol Lieven writes, 'whipping up fear of
Russia allows elites in both the USA and Europe to continue to structure
their institutions and strategies around an adversary that is familiar,
comfortable and fundamentally
safe'.[29](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-29)
On the other hand, the Russian media narrative of the globally
intrusive, dictatorial, and internally corrupt America serves to
strengthen Russia's self-perception as an independent great power guided
by superior values and principles. Presenting democracy promotion and
human rights as being inseparable from the United States' hegemonic
ambitions enables the Kremlin to rally support inside and outside
Russia. Anti-American propaganda and conspiracy theories have been a
powerful method in the Kremlin's
toolkit.[30](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-30) In
the age of global information competition, media serves to articulate
and consolidate national symbols and emotions more than ever. The clash
of values in US--Russia relations was hardly inevitable: alternative
strategies and ideas existed. Influential intellectuals, organizations,
and members of the political class in both countries had voiced support
for cooperation based on mutual interests such as counter-terrorism,
regional stability and disarmament. Yet those advocating exclusive
values, rather than inclusive solutions, prevailed time and
again.[31](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-31) This
was because of a combination of two psychological factors: the
perception of the other side's recognition of one's own values and
interests; and the lack of self-confidence in one's ability to promote
or sustain one's own values. The shift in the US towards a negative
presentation of Russia was a response to the perceived global challenge
to its interests and values, including from Russia. The Kremlin's value
strategy, on the other hand, was more regional and local, resulting from
perceived western pressures and internal confidence. The annexation of
Crimea, in particular, was a popular decision that provided the
leadership with a strong confidence boost. Driven by such perceptions,
the ruling elites abandoned the search for cooperation and adopted
policies of unilateral protection of individual interests. These value
conflicts have roots in a cultural and political divide. Despite initial
expectations, globalization has not replaced the world of nation-states,
but rather introduced new conditions under which national identities,
values and institutions express themselves by reviving old ideas and
practices. As one US commentator wrote, it is abundantly clear that many
in the West 'underestimated the role of nationalism and other forms of
local identity, including sectarianism, ethnicity, tribal bonds, and the
like ... It turns out that many people in many places care more about
national identities, historic enmities, territorial symbols, and
traditional cultural values than they care about 'freedom' as liberals
define
it.'[32](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-32)
Conflicts between the US and Russia are also rooted in history and
politics. Immediately after the Cold War, the two nations did not view
each other as adversaries and their leaders rarely used the emotional
and mutually alienating language of exclusive values. This only started
some twenty years later. However, in the interim, the two nations had
failed to bridge the old cultural gap -- largely because of existing and
increasingly diverging political expectations. While Washington expected
Russia to accept the new status of the USA as sole superpower, the
Kremlin never relinquished its hopes of recovering its former global
role in the post-Cold War era and expected the USA to respect its claim
to be treated as an equal. It was only a matter of time before these
radically different, indeed irreconcilable, expectations clashed,
pushing the two countries towards rivalry -- including in the realm of
values. [The US media led the way in creating the narrative of a
threatening neo-Soviet Russia before the American officials chose to
exploit it. Although the American public did not hold an overwhelmingly
negative image of Russia, public perceptions became more critical from
the late 1990s, creating a space for the revival of the neo-Soviet,
**neo-Cold War narrative**]{.underline}. In developing this narrative,
the media was arguably less influenced by the public and more by various
groups within the US political class. These groups were suspicious of
Putin and by the mid-2000s widely publicized their view of the Russia's
deviation from the 'right path'. In the eyes of the liberal media,
Russia's failure to build a western-style political system and to
cooperate with the West in foreign policy confirmed these groups'
assessments. Russia's political system and values are, of course, quite
different to those of the US. Yet they are not antithetical. In the
Russia of the 1990s, the historically distinct values of Orthodox
Christianity, communality and the strong state were seen as being
compatible with liberal democracy. Some synthesis might have emerged
were it not for interference of interstate politics and the Kremlin's
perception that the US had been ignoring Russia's security interests.
The country's tradition of a powerful executive had centuries-long roots
predating the Soviet state and even the tsarist system, and it is likely
to continue to shape Russia's political
system.[33](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-33) Criticism
of this tradition as being prone to dictatorship and as posing a threat
to western values is similar to criticism by Russian nationalists of
western political systems as being unjust and inherently corrupt. [By
the mid-2000s, the US leadership began to rely on negative perceptions
of Russia, as George W. Bush's statement during the Bratislava
'democracy' summit made clear.]{.underline} However, both Bush and
subsequently Obama refrained from using the inflammatory language common
in the media and each hoped to reach an understanding with Putin on the
basis of the US priorities. In the meantime, the Kremlin was frightened
by Washington's strategy of global regime change and coloured
revolutions and was increasingly sceptical that such an understanding
was possible. These divergent perceptions, which had doomed the
Obama-Medvedev cooperation to failure, then clashed following Putin's
third term as President in 2012. The United States and then Russia each
deployed the emotional language of value confrontation in an attempt to
pressure the other side politically. The US leadership sought to keep
Russia's political system open to American economic and political
interests, whereas the Kremlin sought guarantees against foreign
'intervention'. Both sides developed media strategies -- assertiveness
on Washington's side and defensiveness on Moscow's -- in order to
promote or sustain internal political values. [If the United States and
Russia fail to develop a pragmatic cooperation, the US media will surely
continue their largely negative coverage of Russia]{.underline}, and
vice versa. As E. H. Carr wrote, [state power is prepared to go far to
exploit and create 'the morality convenient to
itself'.]{.underline}[34](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-34) [In
the US, the idea of 'market democracy' obtained the status of just such
a morality system during the Cold
War.[35](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-35) For
its part, Russia abandoned the Soviet system of values only to discover
the older historical value of the strong state, which remerged with the
decline of Russia's liberal aspirations and in response to pressures
from the West. The Kremlin experimented with different ways of opposing
western
influence,[36](https://www.eurozine.com/american-russophobia-age-liberal-decline/#footnote-36) yet
there were also similarities between the newly introduced 'morality' and
the Tsarist practices of state dominance in the areas of information,
politics and economics.]{.underline} As previously in its history,
Russian values developed in tension with and in response to those of
western nations. Christianity, communism and liberal democracy all had
their roots in the West, yet each was adapted to fit Russia's
geopolitical and domestic situation. Ironically, instead of transforming
Russia's traditional institutions, western pressures contributed to
their revival.

Yes, [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) attempted
to divide us through cyber intrusions and by spreading narratives on
social media during the election, although there is no evidence the 2016
election was influenced in any significant way or that they were
attempting to get Donald Trump elected. (The same Trump who is
modernizing our nuclear weapons in order to
confront [Moscow](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moscow/) ...
Mr. Trump's election was a bad outcome
for [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) ... Hillary
Clinton would have shown much more "flexibility," and maybe have sold
some more national security material.) Most likely the Kremlin just
thought the weakness Barack Obama projected should be exploited to make
our way of life seem less attractive to the Russian population, so the
brain drain
from [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) might be
slowed.
Making [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) great
again, if you will.   [Russia has also annexed
territory [Moscow](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moscow/) formerly
controlled on its border. In many ways, we are experiencing the final
stages of the collapse of the [Soviet
Union](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/soviet-union/), more
about [Moscow](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moscow/) retaining
influence in its near-abroad, than conquering the world.  ]{.underline}
However, China has stolen entire computer banks of information from the
federal government. Their new weapons systems look suspiciously like
ours.  Just look at their new "stealth fighter" and make your own
determination where the design came from. China has manipulated trade
markets and its currency to illegally steal from America its wealth, and
its trade secrets, resulting in the destruction of the livelihoods of
millions of hard-working Americans. North Korea has conducted cyber
warfare against the United States, even beat to death an American
college student for stealing a poster, and threatened to destroy the
America with nuclear attacks on her cities. By the way, where is the
Magnitsky Act for Otto's death?  Iran has supported terrorism throughout
the world, and threatened American allies in the Middle East.  They
still are holding American hostages, which the Obama administration
conveniently wanted you to forget. I'm not excusing Russia's actions;
I'm simply saying its behavior should be looked at relative to others.
 So if [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/)'s
actions are not worse than other nations, many of whom are still
communist dictatorships by the way, why are they receiving so much
attention from our corrupt media, the Democrats, and the Left in
general? (As I write this article, The New York Times is extolling the
virtues of Kim Jong-un's sister at the Olympics ... I mean, what the
heck?) Perhaps it comes down to one very simple reason ― [in
reality, [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) today
embodies everything the Left hates.]{.underline} Let me count the ways.
[Russia is Christian. I'm not naive enough to not see through the
shallow relationship between the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox
Church. The relationship is symbiotic: They help each other maintain
money and power.]{.underline} However, as one wise, older, Christian
woman recently remarked to me, "It doesn't matter how Russians get the
Christian message, the fact is they are getting it. That is all that
matters."
 Visiting [Moscow](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moscow/) reminds
me in some ways of the American South. There is a new church going up on
every corner in [the Russian
capital](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moscow/). You can't help
hear the bells ringing somewhere during the day from some church or
monastery nearby. The golden domes dot the landscape.  [We all know how
the Left despises Christianity and enables Islam, female abuse, murder,
and all.]{.underline} Russia is mostly white. Yes, there are minorities
in [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/). However,
they are mostly Asian, and Central Asian. There are not many Africans
in [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/), although
there are
some. [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) tries to
protect its culture. [Although 30 percent
of [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) is Muslim,
the Kremlin attempts to keep a lid on Islamic fundamentalism but is not
always successful. When it is found, it is typically brutally
repressed.]{.underline}  I was always amazed at the way former President
Obama talked
about [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) and
Russian President Vladimir Putin. Comments like,
"[Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) is a regional
power that doesn't make anything," were obviously not helpful, and
derogatory. Comments about "Putin's school boy slouch" could be
considered racist. Think of the reverse, if Mr. Putin called out Mr.
Obama on the way he looked or personal mannerisms?" I think we know the
answer and I think we could agree this is not the way to talk to the
leader of a country with the most nuclear weapons in the world.
 [[Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) is
conservative in many ways. For the most part, Russian women hate
feminism. They had the opportunity to experience real equality during
Soviet times --- and they didn't like it. "Why should I want to act like
a man and have to do everything?" Russian women ask. Genders are very
defined in [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) to
the horror of the cultural Marxists in the West.
 [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) has a gay
propaganda law. The law simply makes it a crime to teach homosexual
propaganda to children. It doesn't say it's OK to beat or kill gays,
although in reality, many times that has been the outcome. However, the
law doesn't say that.]{.underline} I have to admit, [I don't want my
children being taught the gay lifestyle is something to emulate or
aspire to. In the West, homosexuality is being crammed down our
children's throats in school, over the objections of most parents.
 [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) is a very
corrupt place. This corruption is built on centuries of rule by ruthless
strongmen from the East and decades of communism. There is a brutality
that is common throughout the society that we don't experience in most
of the West, a ruthlessness.]{.underline} This reality needs to be
confronted when it encroaches on American interests, or threatens our
security or way of life. As I have written before, NATO borders are a
good place to draw this red line.
 However, [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) is
not the [Soviet
Union](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/soviet-union/). Russia is
not looking to conquer the world. It is attempting to reassert its
influence geopolitically as the largest country on the planet.  [I think
the [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) hysteria in
the West can be explained in a very simple
way: [Russia](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) is
Christian, white and conservative ... everything the Left loves to hate.

so we can confront Russia where need be, but also find ways we can work
together to deal with greater threats to our security, like radical

KING: Those voices you just heard were Joe Jenkins (ph), Nathaniel
Wilson (ph) and Don Osborne (ph). With me on the line right now is Chris
Buskirk. He\'s a conservative talk show host in Phoenix, and he\'s a
friend of the White House. Good morning, Chris. CHRIS BUSKIRK: Good
morning. KING: All right, so there is Washington, D.C., and then
there\'s everywhere else. And I want to point out that those three
gentlemen we heard from in the top there were from Washington state,
Washington state and the state of Texas. Do Trump supporters outside of
Washington seem to have the same concerns as his critics in the
political sphere in Washington? BUSKIRK: No, not at all. I mean, what
people outside of D.C. - at least the people that I interact with -
regardless of whether they be Democrat, Republican, Trump supporter or
not, people are interested in, how does this affect me? Nobody has the
sort of fascination with trying to refight the Cold War with Russia that
seems to have infected the coastal elites. When you get outside of
that - again, whether people be Democrats or Republicans, people are
saying - is the president enacting policies I agree with, that help me,
that don\'t help me? Some people say that he\'s not. Some people say
they are. But the idea that, you know, Trump winked at the beginning of
a news conference - you know, to them, that sounds like a bad, old
recycled \"Seinfeld\" joke. They just say, well, what are the policies
that this administration is pursuing? KING: Well, let\'s talk about
policies. The president has been tweeting this morning. He says, quote,
\"the Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one. They actually
want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the midterms.
Yesterday, the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting
ICE.\" Chris, let me ask you - end quote there. Chris, let me ask you,
**[is border security more important as an issue to President Trump\'s
base than Russia?]{.underline}** BUSKIRK: **[By far.]{.underline}**
KING: Yeah? BUSKIRK: By far. I mean, **[it\'s not even
close.]{.underline}** That was one of the issues that helped set him
apart from the other 16 candidates back in 2016. [People are very
concerned about border security. I live in a border state. And people
want to see immigration laws enforced. And yeah - and that is - when you
try and compare that to a press conference in Helsinki, you know, one is
10 orders of magnitude larger than the other in importance.]{.underline}
KING: And yet, the White House is spending a lot of time trying to
convince people that it is tough on Russia. Why do you think that\'s
been such a hard case to make? BUSKIRK: Well, because nobody wants to
talk about the facts on the ground. This is about pushing an anti-Trump
narrative to try and undermine the election of the president\... KING:
But what are the facts? BUSKIRK: \...In 2016. KING: What are the facts?
BUSKIRK: Well, the facts are that, as of right now, [there are sanctions
on over 700 Russian people and companies that, when Vladimir Putin
invaded the Ukraine, President Obama\'s response was to send planeloads
of blankets and socks. Donald Trump\'s administration has sent Javelin
anti-tank missiles to counter Russian aggression. They\'re just - you
know, they\'re very different fact sets, you know? Blankets and socks
versus anti-tank missiles - who\'s tougher, you know? Last week, Donald
Trump was being criticized for trying to tell his - our NATO allies to
bolster their defenses - well, defenses against who? - against Russian
aggression. And this includes things like not sending tens of billions
of dollars to Russia every year through the Nord Stream
II\...]{.underline} KING: Other people have\... BUSKIRK: [\...Natural
gas pipeline.]{.underline} KING: Yeah\... BUSKIRK: These are basic. This
is just basic premises. KING: Other people have defended the president
by saying that if you look at his actions on the ground in Russia, they
have been tougher than his words. I want to ask you very quickly about
Maria Butina, the Russian accused of infiltrating the NRA in service to
Russian intelligence agencies. So quickly, how are NRA members that you
talked to reacting? BUSKIRK: Very quickly, let justice be done where
she\'s concerned. But the NRA still is a vital defense for the Second
Amendment. KING: Chris Buskirk is a conservative talk show host in
Phoenix. Chris, thanks so much. BUSKIRK: Thank you.

[A smaller fourth-quarter slowdown than feared should reassure investors
over US economic growth in 2019 amid uncertainty over trade and the
global outlook, according to economists and market strategists. The
commerce department on Thursday revealed that gross domestic product
(GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter,
according to an initial estimate]{.underline}. While markedly slower
than the 3.4 per cent rise seen in the third quarter, and the second
quarter's blockbuster number of 4.2 per cent, growth in the final three
months of 2018 was better than the average forecast of 2.3 per cent. For
the full year, GDP growth stands at 2.9 per cent, up from 2.2 per cent
in 2017. It was also the first year since 2004 to show GDP growth of at
least 2 per cent in each quarter, according to Bespoke Investment Group.
James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said
[non-residential investment helped pick up the slack in the fourth
quarter as other indicators softened.]{.underline} Consumer spending
also proved resilient, he added, expanding 2.8 per cent despite market
turmoil during the quarter and a surprise drop in December retail sales.
"This isn't a bad outcome at all," he wrote in a note to clients.
[Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment
Management, said data on spending indicate the US consumer is "alive and
well." "Overall, with expectations fairly low going into this report,
this was a positive surprise that should reinforce the overall health of
the US economy for investors]{.underline}," Mr Ripley added. **[Economic
growth in the range of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent "looks possible" for
the first quarter of 2019]{.underline}**, Mr Knightley said, given the
end of the US government shutdown and a better backdrop related to
financial markets and trade: In terms [of the outlook for the first
quarter, things look to be in decent shape despite the disruption from
the government shutdown. Employment growth is strong and wages are
accelerating, which should support consumer spending. Equity markets
have rebounded sharply, recovering the October-December losses, while
gasoline prices remain subdued, helping to boost household real
disposable incomes.]{.underline} The trade truce is also a positive
development, but obviously a concrete deal in the coming months that
would lead to a clear de-escalation of US-China tensions would be ideal.
Imports may reverse after the surge in 2H18, but inventories are also
likely to be run down for the same reason. Bankrate.com senior economic
analyst Mark Hamrick said the outlook for 2019 appears more muted due to
fading global growth and less stimulus from President Donald Trump's
2017 tax cuts. However, the fourth-quarter reading "adds some
reassurance" after December's market sell-off and suggests "only a
modest negative impact from the partial government shutdown." "The US
economy wasn't so bad in the final months of last year after all. In
fact, it looked pretty good overall," Mr Hamrick said. "[If anything,
the Q4 estimate, subject to revision in a month, should help to comfort
the Federal Reserve from the standpoint of fear of a more substantial
near-term downturn. The US economy was far from contraction in the final
three months of the year."]{.underline}

Separating fact from fiction is always tough when listening to President
Trump, who lives in his own, fact-free fantasy-world. This is
particularly so when it comes to trade and manufacturing. Here are a few
key points on that topic to keep in mind when listening to his State of
the Union address. There's a lot that can be done to create millions of
good manufacturing jobs for working Americans, but not the way this
president is going about it. [The trade deficit is growing more than
twice as fast as the overall economy, because of the Trump
administration's trade and economic policies. The total U.S. [goods
trade
deficit](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/exh1.pdf) has
increased 18.1 percent since 2016, and **our [trade deficit with
China](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html) has
grown even faster, 20.5 percent in the same period** (annual estimates,
based on year to date trade through October)]{.underline}. Growing trade
deficits over the past two decades are the [single largest
cause](http://www.upjohn.org/mfg-decline.pdf) of the loss of roughly 5
million U.S. manufacturing jobs. [The Trump administration has failed to
end currency manipulation and dollar misalignment, despite Trump's
promise to name China a currency manipulator on [day
one](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-will-quit-tpp-in-first-days/) upon
taking office]{.underline}. [**Currency misalignment is the single
largest cause of growing U.S. trade deficits**. U.S. trade can be
rebalanced, creating millions of good manufacturing jobs, by lowering
the value of the dollar by about 25 percent]{.underline}. [The failure
to end currency misalignment is a major cause of [GM's recent
decision](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2018/12/02/gm-cutbacks-result-overvalued-dollar/2161085002/) to
close 5 manufacturing plants and outsource production, eliminating
12,000 jobs, and [Ford's
plan](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trumps-record-manufacturing-mixed-and-complicated/582049/) to
reduce its workforce by 12 percent, eliminating 24,000
jobs.]{.underline} Trump's massive tax cuts (for corporations and the
wealthy) and spending increases are expanding the federal budget
deficit, pushing up the value of the dollar and the U.S. trade deficit.
The dollar has increased 20 percent since 2013, including 5 percent in
2018 alone. As a result[, the IMF now predicts that the broadest measure
of the U.S. trade deficit will nearly double between 2017 and
2022]{.underline}. [Growing trade
deficits](https://www.epi.org/blog/the-failure-of-trumps-trade-and-manufacturing-policy/) will
decimate manufacturing over the next few years, and could push the
United States into a recession. Trump's trade deals with Mexico and
Canada and the negotiations with China will not fix our trade problems.
The new [tax bill encourages firms to
outsource](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/usw-petitions-president-trump-to-use-sotu-to-honor-trade-promises-300789883.html) more
jobs by reducing taxes paid when firms outsource production[. The labor
and environmental restrictions in the new NAFTA deal must be made
strictly enforceable, or it will simply encourage more
outsourcing.]{.underline} And the NAFTA deal grants drug-makers new
powers to block generic competition and to lock in high medicine prices.
[Negotiations with China also seek to lock down increased protections
for the intellectual property and profits of U.S. multinationals, but
this will just encourage them to outsource more production to
China.]{.underline} And [China has already
played](https://www.epi.org/blog/the-failure-of-trumps-trade-and-manufacturing-policy/) its
ace-in-the-hole in the trade war with the United States, lowering the
value of its currency by 10 percent since April of 2018, more than
offsetting the impacts of Trump's tariffs on trade flows. As a result,
the U.S. trade deficit with China recently reached an [all-time
high](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html'), despite
Trump's China tariffs. [The most important
cause](https://www.epi.org/publication/testimony-before-the-u-s-department-of-commerce-on-causes-of-significant-trade-deficits-for-2016/) of
growing U.S. trade deficits and manufacturing job losses is not faulty
trade deals, but a misaligned dollar. A handful of countries with
substantially undervalued currencies have been running large, structural
trade surpluses for several decades. This hurts workers in many
countries that have persistently large trade deficits, including the
United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico as well as the United States. The surplus
countries are China, the European Union (especially Germany and the
Netherlands), Japan, and Korea, plus a handful of countries that have
engaged in persistent currency manipulation including Denmark,
Singapore, Switzerland, and Taiwan. So what should the United States be
doing instead? [The single most important step we can take to rebuild
manufacturing is to rebalance trade by realigning the U.S.
dollar]{.underline}. There are [several
ways](https://www.epi.org/policy/#trade) this can be achieved. In 1985,
the last time this was done, [Congress worked with the administration to
encourage our trading partners to negotiate the Plaza Accord, an
agreement to realign currencies. If a similar effort were to fail,
Congress could authorize the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to
sell dollars in global markets to reduce the currency's value to a
competitive level. Or, we can impose a tax on purchases by foreign
governments and investors of dollar-denominated financial
assets.]{.underline} Lastly, Congress should not be pressured into
approving trade deals unless they achieve enforceable labor and
environmental standards that can be quickly implemented. Likewise, new
agreements should not be approved if they increase the incentives to
outsource production from the United States. It is time for a new
approach to trade, one based on a clear assessment of its implications
for jobs and production in the United States.

### US Clout Low

#### American credibility is low now---no spillover

Julie **[[Ray]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**,
1-18-**[[2018]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}**, "World's Approval of U.S.
Leadership Drops to New Low", Gallup Poll,
<https://news.gallup.com/poll/225761/world-approval-leadership-drops-new-low.aspx>
JEJP

WASHINGTON, D.C. \-- [**One year into Donald Trump\'s presidency, the
image of U.S. leadership is weak**er worldwide than it was under his two
predecessors**.**]{.underline} [Median approval of U.S. leadership
across 134 countries and areas stands at a new low of 30%,]{.underline}
according to a [new Gallup
report](http://news.gallup.com/reports/225587/rating-world-leaders-2018.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&g_campaign=item_225761&g_medium=copy).
The most recent approval rating, based on Gallup World Poll surveys
conducted between March and November last year, [is down 18 percentage
points from the 48% approval rating in the last year of President Barack
Obama\'s administration, and is four points lower than the previous low
of 34% in the last year of President George W. Bush\'s
administration]{.underline}. The recent drop in approval ratings is
unrelated to the world\'s being less familiar with the new U.S.
administration. The global median who do not have an opinion about U.S.
leadership in 2017 (23%) is similar to the 25% in the last year of the
Obama presidency. Instead, [disapproval of U.S. leadership increased
almost as much as approval declined]{.underline}. The 43% median
disapproval, up 15 points from the previous year, set a new record as
well, not only for the U.S. but for any other major global power that
Gallup has asked about in the past decade. [The relatively fragile image
of U.S. leadership in 2017 reflects large and widespread losses in
approval and relatively few gains.]{.underline} [Out of 134 countries,
U.S. leadership approval ratings declined substantially \-- by 10
percentage points or more \-- in 65 countries that include many longtime
U.S. allies and partners]{.underline}. Portugal, Belgium, Norway and
Canada led the declines worldwide, with approval ratings of U.S.
leadership dropping 40 points or more in each country. While majorities
in each of these countries approved of U.S. leadership in 2016,
majorities disapproved in 2017. In contrast, U.S. leadership approval
increased 10 points or more in just four countries: Liberia (+17),
Macedonia (+15), Israel (+14), and Belarus (+11). The 67% of Israelis
who approve of U.S. leadership is on par with the ratings Israelis gave
the U.S. during the Bush administration. Notably, interviewing in Israel
took place before Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel\'s
capital, but he had repeatedly promised to do so during his campaign for
president. [Regionally, the image of U.S. leadership suffered most in
the Americas, where approval ratings dropped to a new low.]{.underline}
The median of 24% who approve of U.S. leadership in the region now
stands at about half of what it was in the last year of the Obama
administration (49%). Approval of U.S. leadership plunged in every
country in the region in 2017. In fact, there were double-digit
decreases in all countries except Venezuela, where approval dropped nine
points. U.S. leadership approval ratings suffered nearly as much in
Europe as they did in the Americas; however, the current 25% approval
rating there is not the lowest on record \-- the ratings during the last
two years of George W. Bush\'s administration still hold that
distinction. In Asia, approval dropped to 30%, tying the previous low
that Gallup measured during the Bush administration. Africa as a whole
remained the bright spot for U.S. leadership approval, as it has been
for the past decade. Nonetheless, [the approval rating for the region is
at its lowest level yet, clinging to a bare majority (51%) that may be
at risk after the president\'s alleged remarks about the
continent]{.underline} last week. **[The losses in U.S. leadership
approval may have implications on U.S. influence abroad]{.underline}**.
With its stable approval rating of 41%, Germany has replaced the U.S. as
the top-rated global power in the world[. The U.S. is now on nearly even
footing with China (31%) and barely more popular than Russia (27%) \--
two countries that Trump sees as rivals seeking to \"challenge American
influence, values and wealth]{.underline}.\" The present situation
represents a marked change in the status quo since Obama\'s presidency,
when the [image of U.S.
leadership](http://news.gallup.com/poll/182795/russia-receives-lowest-approval-world-highest.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&g_campaign=item_225761&g_medium=copy) remained
relatively strong worldwide. In Obama\'s last year in office, for
example, the U.S. led Germany by seven points, China by 17 points and
Russia by 22 points. The current rankings instead look more like a
return to the status quo during the last year of the Bush administration
\-- with Germany on top, followed by China, the U.S. and then Russia \--
except now, the U.S. has even more ground to make up. It is too early in
Trump\'s presidency to deem his \"America First\" foreign policy a
success or failure. However, it is clear that based on the trajectory of
what the world thinks of the U.S., many of the U.S. alliances and
partnerships that the Trump administration considers a \"great
strength\" are potentially at risk.

the 12-nation free-trade deal that President Obama negotiated but left
unfinished]{.underline}. Trump derided the pact as a bad deal for
America. But leaving it hasn't turned out that well either. [The
remaining 11 members proceeded anyway, slashing tariffs and leaving U.S.
businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage]{.underline}. In
particular, American exports of grains, meats and other farm goods to
Japan --- by far the biggest of those 11 economies --- have taken a hit.
[Now the White House is scrambling to undo the damage of Trump's swift
withdrawal from what would have been the world's largest regional trade
agreement.]{.underline} Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrives
Friday in Washington to meet with Trump. At the top of the
administration's agenda are trade talks to level the playing field for
the United States. [While Trump was busy slapping tariffs on China and
other countries, **Japan also concluded a pact with the European Union**
that lowered duties and other barriers to ease trade flows. Between the
EU and Asia-Pacific, Japan is now starting to import substantially more
from its free-trade partners, at America's expense.]{.underline} That's
bad for U.S. farmers who were already reeling from [tit-for-tat tariffs
on soybeans and other farm goods entering
China](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-soybean-farmers-tariffs-20180816-story.html).
"Give us some relief. We're not surviving the way it is," said Greg
Svenningsen, 60, a North Dakota farmer who's seen the cash price for his
wheat plunge 25% since last fall, thanks to slumping demand from Japan
and other Pacific buyers. For some products, the difference in tariffs
is stark. Australian wine entering Japan is taxed at 5.6% and will
eventually drop to zero. There's no duty at all for wine from the EU and
Chile. But for California, it's 15%. That's pinched the U.S. share of
imported wine in Japan, and the pain is likely to get worse. [Hiro
Tejima of the Wine Institute's Japan program says the EU-Japan accord is
opening up more opportunities for European wine]{.underline}. Italy, the
third-largest wine exporter to Japan, recently signed a deal to promote
Italian bottles at 10,000 supermarkets in Japan. American wine ranks
fourth among imports in Japan, with France and Chile at the top two
spots. "[U.S. exporters of wheat, beef, pork, dairy, wine, potatoes,
fruits and vegetables and other products are facing collapse of their
Japanese market share as these lucrative sales are handed over to their
competitors]{.underline}," the Wine Institute and 87 other food and farm
groups and companies said in a joint letter sent this week to Trump's
top trade official, Robert Lighthizer. Lighthizer and the Japanese
economy minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, launched the trade talks last week,
and were meeting again on Thursday ahead of Abe's visit with Trump. The
opening of trade negotiations poses new challenges for Abe, who has
worked hard to[ cultivate relations with
Trump](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-abe-trump-summit-20180416-story.html).
The Japanese leader has twice visited Mar-a-Lago, and is now preparing
to meet Trump three times in as many months. After this weekend in
Washington, in which Abe will be joining a birthday celebration for
First Lady Melania Trump, the Japanese leader is expected to host Trump
in late May for an official state dinner in Tokyo where Trump will also
greet Japan's new emperor. And then the prime minister is to lead the
Group of 20 major economies' summit in Osaka late June. The Japanese
plan has been "to get Abe in front of Trump, flood the zone and keep the
president thinking about Japan and liking Abe on a personal level," said
Michael J. Green, senior vice president and Japan chair at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies. So far, Abe has avoided any big
brushes with Trump, in part because the American president has been
preoccupied with China. And one notable foreign policy achievement that
Abe can point to is the Trump administration's full embrace of Japan's
approach calling for a free and open Indo-Pacific, a recognition of the
strategic links between the Indian Ocean region and the Western Pacific
in light of China's increasingly assertive and expansive activities. At
the same time, Trump himself has said little about how he might develop
that strategy or about America's broader role in the region. [The
Trans-Pacific Partnership was supposed to be the linchpin of the Obama
administration's move to bind the region around an American-designed
system of commerce and provide a counterweight to China's rising
influence. The deal was concluded but never found enough support in
Congress]{.underline}, and Trump dumped the pact three days into office,
saying it was a "great thing for the American worker what we just did."
[After the U.S. withdrawal, **Abe played a key role in reviving it among
the remaining 11 nations**. That didn't endear Abe to Trump. The
president [didn't give Japan a break on steel
tariffs](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-tariffs-20180308-story.html).
And at times he has publicly railed about Japan's trade surplus with the
United States]{.underline}. Shige Watanabe, the Japanese Embassy's
economic minister in Washington, said Japan is prepared to provide the
United States the same tariff rates that Tokyo negotiated with the EU
and the 10 other Pacific Rim countries, which include Canada, Mexico and
Vietnam. That should give some relief to American farmers, although it's
unclear how fast a deal can come together. [The two sides have not yet
agreed on the scope of the trade negotiations]{.underline}. The Trump
administration will be asking for a lot more than tariff reductions on
agriculture imports. The big fight will most likely be over cars.
Although Japanese companies are now producing 3.7 million vehicles a
year on U.S. soil --- with some models having even higher domestic
content than American brands --- Japan's auto trade accounts for the
vast majority of the country's \$68-billion trade surplus in goods with
the United States. (China's merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. was
\$419 billion last year.) [Japan has indicated that it won't accept
voluntary export quotas or restraints on cars, as it did in the 1980s
when it knuckled under the Reagan administration's demands for curbing
shipments of TVs, textiles, steel, cars and other products.]{.underline}
Clyde Prestowitz, an Asia economy expert who was a top trade negotiator
during the Reagan presidency, said it's going to be a difficult
discussion. He offered one novel idea: that the Japanese reduce the
country's trade surplus by exporting more American-produced cars to
Japan. Watanabe reacted coolly to that suggestion, noting there are
autoworkers in Japan to think about and that Japanese companies already
send U.S.-made cars to other parts of the world. Meanwhile, [Trump is
considering a sweeping move to assess tariffs on imported cars, on the
same basis of national security that the administration applied when it
imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum.]{.underline} Administration
officials have said that even if Trump decides next month to go ahead
with the car tariffs, the United States would not impose them on Japan
while they're negotiating a trade deal. But that threat will nonetheless
hang over the talks, as [Trump [has been keen on employing tariffs as
leverage](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-na-pol-trump-tariffs-china-trade-qa-20190423-story.html) to
win concessions.]{.underline}
