### 1AC Gun violence

#### U.S. arms to Mexico perpetuate human rights violations and structural violence -- torture, disappearances, and massacres

Forces Commit War Crimes: Stop Arming Them,"

Americans might think of Acapulco as a tropical idyll but it's
increasingly something different: a homicide capital. [[U.S.
weapons]{.mark}, sold to Mexican law enforcement authorities ostensibly
to help combat criminals, [are]{.mark} instead [fueling violence,
torture, disappearances, and massacres]{.mark}.]{.underline} A new
investigation by the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of
Human Rights (CMDPDH), a UN-funded human rights watchdog, has found that
[[American guns sold to]{.mark} [the Mexican army are
disappearing]{.mark} from armories and being reported lost or
stolen.]{.underline} I spent four months in Mexico working with the
commission's investigative team, and [we concluded that as many as [20
percent of]{.mark} the guns [sold]{.mark} in some Mexican states---more
than 20,000 over the past decade---[have gone
missing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Mexican authorities have trouble keeping
track of the guns they buy.]{.underline} No fewer than 342 disappeared
from Acapulco's police armory before the September raids. It's
impossible to know what these guns have since been used for, but the
investigation found that [[more than 1,400 unmarked graves have been
unearthed]{.mark} across Mexico since 2007]{.underline}. [These pits
held the remains of almost [2,000 victims]{.mark}, some in [mass graves
with more 80 bodies]{.mark}.]{.underline} [More graves are found every
month, and the total number of victims of this violence is likely much
higher]{.underline}. [[The Mexican military]{.mark} is the only legal
importer and vendor of weapons in the country. It [buys guns from
American companies and then distributes them to police forces and
federal agencies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because gun ownership in Mexico
is tightly controlled, [most of the guns it resells go to state and
local police, [who are notoriously corrupt and]{.mark} often [collude
with]{.mark} or are infiltrated by [drug gangs]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Either by theft or graft, the [20 percent of weapons that are "lost or
stolen" tend to wind up in the hands of criminals]{.underline}. In
effect, then, [the United States is fueling the violence in Mexico by
providing the guns being used by both criminals and the corrupt police
who are failing to stop them]{.underline}. And the [Trump]{.underline}
administration, [eager to sell even more arms, is seeking to weaken the
few safeguards that are in place]{.underline}. [The Example of Acapulco
Events in Acapulco]{.underline} show just how out of hand the situation
has become. [Two]{.underline} of the city's [police commanders were
arrested for murder]{.underline}. [The situation got so bad]{.underline}
[that]{.underline}, in September, [Mexican soldiers and marines mounted
a series of raids to disarm the city's entire police force]{.underline}.
Sadly, [Acapulco is only the latest of more than a dozen cities and
towns where [Mexico's federal government has had to step in to dissolve
police forces that became instruments of
**terror**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Last year, [there were more than
30,000 homicides in Mexico]{.mark}, the highest number ever recorded.
[American weapons have been used in]{.mark} some of [Mexico's]{.mark}
most gruesome [mass murders]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a case that has
gripped Mexico since 2014, [six students were killed and 43 disappeared
after police officers attacked their bus---using Connecticut-made Colt
AR 6530 rifles]{.underline}. In another case, [police officers in
Tanhuato killed five people using Arizona-based Dillon Aero mini-guns
mounted on Black Hawk helicopters, built in Stratford,
Connecticut]{.underline}. In a third instance in Veracruz, [police death
squads executed 15 innocent people after buying 674 firearms from Colt,
Bushmaster, and Combined Systems]{.underline}. Trump's Response The
Trump administration has proposed what could be a decisive weakening of
the already ineffective system by which the United States controls
small-arms sales to repressive security forces by shifting
responsibility for vetting these sales from the State Department to the
Commerce Department. That would move the process from a department with
at least a formal commitment to human rights to one whose priority is
supporting American businesses. The administration also wants to begin
allowing American gun makers to sell semi-automatic weapons without
first getting a State Department license. And the administration
proposes to reduce oversight of such sales by Congress. Although
Congress is now notified of commercial weapons sales worth over \$1
million under the Arms Export Control Act, Trump's proposed changes
would stop those notifications. Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Dianne
Feinstein (D-CA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) have criticized the proposed
changes, but the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers have
voiced their support for them. (The Obama administration first proposed
these changes, but reversed course after several high-profile mass
shootings.) In June, twelve members of Congress asked the secretaries of
state and defense for "a full and public evaluation" of U.S. security
aid and arms sales to Mexico, which they said has contributed to "a
dramatic increase in human rights violations." But without widespread
concern from the public and the press about the situation in Mexico,
these policy changes and the raging violence haven't been high
priorities. Research has shown that limiting access to guns may reduce
violence in Mexico. A study from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst
found that homicides rose 60 percent in Mexican municipalities with
access to American assault weapons compared to those without it.

#### The U.S. must limit exports to prevent gun violence in Mexico from boiling over into civil war

Tamara **Pearson**, April 6, **2018**. "The US gun industry kills more
overseas,"
https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/us-gun-industry-kills-more-overseas

I live next door to the world's largest gun manufacturer. Here [[in
Mexico, the murder rates are close to civil war
levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. They broke records last year, with 41,217
homicides and 25,339 first degree murders over the course of the year.
[[And those are the official figures --- which]{.mark}, if anything,
[tend to under-report]{.mark} reality]{.underline}. United States
President Donald Trump has labelled Mexican migrants heading to the US
as "criminals", but has ironically overlooked the fact that [70% of [the
guns]{.mark} coming into Mexico [originate in the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the recent shooting in the YouTube
headquarters in San Francisco, the inspiring movements of young people
demanding gun control, and Black Lives Matter protesting police
impunity, the issue of systemic, deathly violence in the US is receiving
important attention. But the impact of that violence outside US borders
largely goes under the radar. [In every measurable way, [the US
is]{.mark} head honcho of the global violence industry. It is [the
biggest arms exporter]{.mark}]{.underline}, it dominates global military
spending, and it sold the majority of guns, globally, in 2016 (Britain
comes second with just under 10% of gun sales). [It has been the leading
arms dealer in the world for 25 of the past 26 years]{.underline}.
**[[It is hard to estimate how many deaths the US is responsible for
overseas, especially indirect ones and those that have resulted from
illegal gun trading]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But analyst Nicolas JS
Davies estimated that "about 2.4 million Iraqis have been killed as a
result of the illegal invasion of their country by the United States and
the United Kingdom" and "about 1.2 million Afghans and Pakistanis have
been killed as a result of the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001".
There are many more deaths in Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. [It is
important to consider how the US's violence overseas contributes to a
culture of violence and a glorification of murder]{.underline} within
its borders. [It is also important to **remember how profitable the arms
industry is**]{.underline}. Like the drug trade, [US companies have
every interest in a strong demand for guns in and outside US
borders]{.underline}. An IBIS report on the guns and ammunition
manufacturing industry noted: "In response to a weakening domestic
military market, industry players have increasingly sought growth in
exports". That [[growth in exports has been **a key factor** in the
percentage of murders committed in Mexico]{.mark} with guns]{.underline}
increasing from 15% in 1997 to 66% last year. [Now, [there are]{.mark}
about [300 million guns in Mexico --- despite the fact that the country
has just one shop]{.mark} (hidden discretely down a small lane in the
capital) where they may be bought]{.underline}. The figures are almost
as bad in nearby Central American countries El Salvador and Honduras ---
each with some of the highest murder rates in the world. In El Salvador,
between 2014 and 2016, 49% of recovered guns had been originally bought
in the US. For the same period in Honduras, 45% were originally bought
in the US. Indeed, the Western media focuses on the drug trade across
the Americas, but ignores the [gun [traffickers]{.mark}]{.underline}
coming from the US who [[are exploiting US gun laws]{.underline}]{.mark}
to sell guns over the border.

#### U.S. weapons sales to Mexican authorities backfire -- violence escalates between cartels and the state

**Lindsay-Poland '18** \[John, 3/28/18, Coordinator of Stop US Arms to
Mexico, Al Jazeera, "America's Guns: Made in the US, killing in Mexico",
<https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/america-guns-killing-mexico-180328060253902.html>,
accessed 6/28/2019, DL\]

[[The legal export of guns by US gun producers to Mexican police
is]{.mark} also [feeding criminal activities]{.mark} and the illegal gun
market [in Mexico]{.mark}, in several ways. The Mexican military is the
only legal importer of firearms in Mexico; in turn, it sells weapons to
police throughout the country, and, to a lesser extent, to private
individuals and security companies.]{.underline} State and local police
in Mexico have had [more than 20,000 firearms go missing or stolen since
2006]{.underline}, according to Mexican military documents. More than
8,000 rifles and handguns
[disappeared](https://www.animalpolitico.com/2015/05/policias-en-mexico-pierden-seis-armas-de-fuego-al-dia-ya-van-15-mil-robadas-o-extraviadas/)
during that time from police arsenals in the city and state of Mexico
and Guerrero state alone. [In Guerrero,]{.underline} infamous for
corruption and human rights violations by its police and military, [out
of every five firearms legally acquired by police, more than one went
missing or stolen. [US exports of weapons to the Mexican armed forces
have grown enormously as part of the militarised security strategy that
has disastrously failed to reduce homicides. The use of state
weapons]{.mark} in operations [to decapitate]{.mark} the leadership of
[criminal organisations has **provoked more violence**]{.mark} among
prospective successors, [while]{.mark} also [**feeding an arms race**
between criminal groups and the]{.mark} parts of the [state]{.mark} that
fight them. In addition, **[many Mexican police armed with US weapons
directly commit human rights violations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
local police who attacked students from the Ayotzinapa teachers school
and disappeared 43 of them in 2014, for example, were armed with AR-15
rifles exported by Colt Industries in Connecticut, according to court
[records](https://www.afsc.org/resource/report-where-guns-go). [When
police collude with criminal organisations by giving them information or
fighting their rivals in exchange for money, they are strengthening
organised crime, even without directly trafficking weapons to it. **[US
gun exports to Mexico thus strengthen the very forces, in many
instances, that the arms sales are supposed to
combat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 

#### Reject moral complicity with gun violence in Mexico by cutting off arms sales

Gabriel **Schivone**, December 17, **2018**. "Opinion: Mexico\'s gun
violence a \"moral crisis of complicity\" for U.S. border states,"
https://tucson.com/opinion/local/opinion-mexico-s-gun-violence-a-moral-crisis-of-complicity/article_2292df4f-b0f9-54bd-924d-66b5d2470573.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=user-share&fbclid=IwAR2p1zvBYa7SuCYD6E_mgldguppSCkWPZVPLtpCBy_QzOgpdTYkmOyND-u8

[[Many]{.mark} southern neighbors [are hopeful about]{.mark} the
overwhelming victory in [Mexico]{.mark}]{.underline} by new president
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who enjoys comparisons with independent
Sen. Bernie Sanders and British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. [[But
the]{.mark} logistical and political [challenges that face López Obrador
are enormous]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Since Mexico's transition to nominal
democracy in the last two decades,]{.underline} [[crime and gun violence
continue to afflict]{.mark} communities throughout [the country, with
more gun homicides in 2017 than any year on record and increased
violations by state forces]{.mark}, many of whom are colluding with
criminal groups. More than 120,000 people have been killed during the
term of outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto. This is not just a
concern for Mexicans. **[Mexican gun violence remains a moral crisis of
complicity for those]{.mark}**]{.underline} of us in border states
[**[that oversee the legal]{.mark}** and illegal **[provision of
weapons]{.mark}** used **[for]{.mark}** violence in
**[Mexico]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The market for semi-automatic assault
rifles provided by gun shops in Tucson and other southwestern cities is
perfect for criminal groups that use them to commit violence in Mexico.
For example, a local gun shop sold at least nine guns, including assault
rifles, that were trafficked to Mexico and recovered at crime scenes
between 2007 and 2010 (the period for which detailed data is available).
The sales are part of the 70 percent of guns seized in Mexico that are
traced to U.S. gun stores. Also in Tucson, just a short westerly walk
from Flowing Wells High School, Milkor USA produces grenade
multi-launchers in partnership with Abrams Manufacturing that are used
by the Mexican army's Special Forces Group (GFE). The GFE, which has
received U.S. military training, is the successor to the Grupo Aeromóvil
de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFEs), many of whom received U.S. military
training and later founded Los Zetas, one of the most feared and brutal
Mexican cartels. In 2016, Mexico purchased more than 2,000 military
rifles from Mesa-based Nammo Talley, for more than \$8 million. Dillon
Aero, in Scottsdale, has sold Mexican forces 44 mini-guns, at \$67,600
apiece, that fire 125 rounds per second. One was fired from a helicopter
to kill five people in a massacre in Tanhuato, Michoacán, in 2015,
according to an investigation by Mexico's national human rights
commission. Raytheon Missile Systems produces bomb kits and missiles
designed to carry cluster bombs at its Tucson location next to the
airport and recently agreed to export missiles for \$41 million to the
Mexican Navy. Raytheon cluster bombs have been exported from Tucson to
Saudi Arabia and earlier this year killed 23 people at a wedding in
Yemen. Last year, Arizona companies exported an unprecedented \$8.1
million worth of "military explosives" to Mexico. In this climate, bold
advocacy work is needed more than ever. On Nov. 16, for example, more
than 300 people peacefully protested Milkor USA's exports from its
Tucson plant of grenade launchers to Mexico. The protest occurred on the
10th anniversary of the forced disappearance, torture, and murder of two
brothers from their home, carried out by the same special forces armed
by Milkor's weapons. [[The best way for us to support]{.mark} Mexicans
in their quest for [peace is to stop]{.mark} the causes of bloodshed.
That includes stopping **[the massive flow of guns]{.mark}** used in the
violence]{.underline}.

#### Prioritizing gun violence is key to counter desensitization.

Menachem **Creditor, '15**. Jun 20, 2015, Contributor, Rabbi of
Congregation Netivot Shalom (Berkeley, CA), Founder of Rabbis Against
Gun Violence, "Gun Violence Is a Moral Problem,"

[[The torrent of gun violence headlines and statistics has led many to
simply stop seeing them]{.underline}]{.mark}. I believe [[we
are]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a nation, [**[weary to our bones from all
this death]{.mark}**. [We have]{.mark}, as a society, [become]{.mark}
victims of what Malcolm Gladwell famously called "the problem of
immunity", in which being **[overwhelmed]{.mark}** by massive amounts of
information leads one or more people to be **[unable to process it,
rendering it functionally invisible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is,
perhaps understandable. [[We have become]{.underline}]{.mark}, to borrow
a phrase from Pink Floyd, "**[[comfortably numb]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Once in a while, national attention is provoked by either a slow media
cycle or a large number of casualties. But in the aftermaths of even
these tragedies, despite overwhelming support for universal background
checks for gun sales (even among NRA members), there has been no
significant and lasting national response. Legislators seem incapable of
compromise, and the frontlines of the culture war are bombarded by
extremists who alternatively demonize gun owners and gun reform
advocates alike. Is there anything to be done? Is there no way to make
any change in a system of sustained violence that costs upwards of
30,000 lives every year? My claim is that my fellow faith leaders can
bridge the divide between gun owners and gun reform advocates. **[[This
is a moral crisis, and it requires a moral
response]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Whereas elected officials and those
employed to sway their decisions are driven by the market, faith
communities of all stripes are driven to maintain the dignity of the
Divine Image in every human life. Faith reminds us of our common
humanity, can provoke that most human of responses to the needless
deaths of our fellow citizens: compassion. Americans of all political
leanings --- gun owners, gun law reformers, mental health advocates ---
wish for the fulfillment of American Scripture, which includes in its
promises a basic right: life. The great civil rights activist Rabbi
Abraham Joshua Heschel once claimed that, when confronting great
societal rupture, there is "no time for neutrality," that: \...one of
the lessons we have derived from the events of our time is that we
cannot dwell at ease under the sun of our civilization, that man is the
least harmless of beings. We know this is true. [[We must allow our
numbed hearts to be shaken from a false sense of
security]{.underline}]{.mark} [and reclaim our roles as partners in a
noble American impulse, based in the very basic societal value of mutual
obligation]{.underline}. And, if we need more motivation than our
national prophetic values, we might do well to consider the statistical
reality --- if we do nothing --- that our streets, our churches, our
children are all on the line.

**[[Recent]{.mark} official [data]{.mark} from Mexico and the United

years]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}** reaching nearly \$122 million
between 2015 and 2017, according to trade records of the U.S. Census
Bureau, more than 12 times the amount of those exports in 2002-2004.7
This growth coincides with an increase in Mexico's own production of
weapons for military use.

**[[In]{.mark} June [2018,]{.mark} twelve [members of]{.mark} the U.S.

on drugs has resulted in a dramatic increase in human rights violations,
including torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial
executions."]{.mark}]{.underline}** They called for "a full and public
evaluation of the Merida Initiative, U.S. security aid and arms sales to
Mexico."8 Other members of Congress have also requested a General
Accounting Office report on the Merida Initiative.9 It is well past time
to change the course of security strategies in Mexico and cease
depending on the acquisition of weapons to achieve reductions in
violence**. [[The election of a new government in Mexico provides

Unfortunately, [[the exponential growth in the number of weapons
entering Mexico has not been accompanied by controls to effectively and
transparently register, control, and track the end uses of these guns to
ensure that they do not land in the hands of police or military units
that are credibly alleged to have committed gross human rights abuses or
have colluded with criminal groups]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the very
groups that security forces are being armed to combat.

#### U.S. arms sales to Mexico are the biggest -- bigger than Israel 

Bill **Conroy**, Global Research, April 16, **2011**. "The Mexican Drug
War Has Become A Hot Market for U.S. Weapons Sales,"
https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-mexican-drug-war-has-become-a-hot-market-for-u-s-weapons-sales/24353

[The dollar value of [U.S. private-sector weapons shipments to
Mexico]{.mark} in fiscal year 2009 exceeded the value of private arms
shipments to two other major conflict regions elsewhere in the world,
Iraq and Afghanistan, and [even outpaced]{.mark} the value of arms
shipped to one of the United States' staunchest allies, [Israel]{.mark}.
[U.S.]{.mark} private-sector [suppliers shipped]{.mark} a total of
[\$177 million worth]{.mark} of defense articles]{.underline} --- which
includes items like military aircraft, firearms and explosives --- [[to
Mexico]{.mark} in fiscal 2009]{.underline}, which ended Sept. 30 of that
year. [[By comparison, over the same period]{.mark}, private arms
companies in [the U.S. shipped \$40 million worth]{.mark} of weapons [to
Afghanistan; \$126 million to Iraq; and \$131 million to
Israel]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, Colombia, the source of most of
the world's cocaine and a major battlefront in the so-called war on
drugs, received only \$30 million in private-sector arms shipments from
the U.S. in fiscal 2009.

**abuses** **of** **human** **rights**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including
forced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings, as
documented by the U.S. Department of State, Inter-American Human Rights
Commission, and Mexico's National Human Rights Commission. **[[Victims
are disproportionately indigenous people and
migrants]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Collaboration between organized
criminal groups and the Mexican state is also extensively documented at
the local, state, and federal levels, leading observers such as

it---banning weapons of extermination, and a stronger policy on [the
**sa[le of weapons to the]{.mark}** Mexican
**[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which **[[is the sale of weapons to

[[Mexican military]{.mark} and police authorities [are]{.mark} still [at
war with]{.mark} the country\'s [drug trafficking organizations]{.mark}.
And [the fight]{.mark} still [isn\'t going well]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Since 2006, [[the conflict has generated]{.mark} as many as [164,345
civilian deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}. Experts are still unable to agree
if murders are going up or down. More Mexicans have died violently over
the past decade than Afghan or Iraqi civilians over the same period,
combined. [[High-powered weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with
handguns, [[is playing a key role]{.mark} in driving the
violence.]{.underline} Many [[commentators assume that arms]{.mark}
and]{.underline} ammunition [[are flooding]{.underline}]{.mark} into the
arsenals of drug cartels [[from illegal dealers]{.mark} spanning the
US-Mexican border.]{.underline} There are empirical studies
substantiating this claim. Other analysts contend that some
military-grade firepower consists of stolen and leftover kit from
Central American conflicts of the 1970s and \'80s. They are also partly
right. But [[the full picture is more complex]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
fact, at least 50 countries have exported military-grade weapons and
associated materiel to Mexico over the past five decades --- with well
over half of them exceeding \$1 million in sales over the period. There
has been a steady uptick in sales since 2006, and especially since
former President Felipe Calderon ratcheted up the drug war. According to
UN customs data compiled by NISAT, a research group, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates [is by far the largest exporter of
military arms to Mexico. The sums are]{.mark}]{.underline} not trivial.
The US has exported [[more than \$300 million]{.mark} worth of "military
style" weapons to Mexican authorities]{.underline} since the 1960s; more
than half of those sales have been since the year 2000. Top exporters
following the US are Italy, Belgium, France and Israel, some of the
world\'s largest manufacturers. These firearms include crew-serviced
machine guns, assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, heavy
explosives and related munitions, parts and accessories. However, the US
and others also sell vast quantities of \"civilian-style\" weapons,
including shotguns, handguns, and related ammunition. An arms mapping
visualization developed by the Igarapé Institute with partners including
Google Ideas shows that Mexican imports of all types of weaponry
increased steadily from 2006 onward. Moreover, the share of all imports
that included military-style weapons shot up from around 10-25 percent a
year to 30-50 percent each year during this timeframe. While many of
these weapons are officially destined for the Mexican armed forces and
the country\'s more than 1,600 federal, state and local police agencies,
some of them fall into the hands of cartels and militia. [In Mexico,
[military-style arms are frequently diverted and leaked]{.mark} from
official arsenals.]{.underline} In some cases weapons are sent to the
wrong customers altogether. For example, a recent high-profile case
involved 9,000 firearms shipped illegally to Mexico by a German firm. Of
course, military-issue firearms and ammunition are routinely trafficked
across international borders, including from the US. The Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has traced high-powered
rifles and handguns shipped by land, air and sea. One especially
controversial operation dubbed Fast and Furious allowed weapons from the
US to be smuggled to Mexican cartels for tracking purposes [---
[hundreds were lost en route and linked to]{.mark} subsequent
[crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Igarapé Institute and University of San
Diego research has determined that a considerable proportion of
illegally acquired firearms in Mexico were originally sold by federally
licensed dealers in the US. Meanwhile, older issue US and Soviet-style
weaponry is also trafficked from post-conflict Central American
countries, including via El Salvador, Honduras and of course Guatemala.
[[Military and police stocks]{.underline}]{.mark} in some of these
Central American countries [[were]{.mark} [singled
out]{.mark}]{.underline} by the International Commission against
Impunity in Guatemala [[as the largest source of illegal
firearms]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Twentieth-century
M16s and AK-47s have surfaced in the arsenals of the Juarez, Sinaloa,
Zeta and Gulf cartels, though the quantities are comparatively modest.
Making matters more complicated, the Mexican authorities lack a robust
marking and tracing system. They have traditionally relied on their US
counterparts for background checks on seized weapons. Getting a handle
on leaked and trafficked weapons has simply not been a priority of
successive governments. In the past, samples of seized weapons were
submitted to the ATF (using eTrace). Extrapolations generated from these
assessments suggest that up to 70 percent of recovered firearms were
from the US, though these numbers are disputed on both sides of the
border. While internationally supportive of more gun regulation, Mexico
is not especially transparent when it comes to reporting on weapons
exports, imports or recovery, as the Small Arms Survey arms barometer
makes clear. It is also unable to comprehensively get to grips with
where illegal guns are coming from. At least part of the problem is that
under Mexican law, all firearms seized by the government must be
surrendered to the armed forces within 48 hours. The military is charged
with \"safeguarding\" these arms and is under no compulsion to assist in
related law enforcement investigations. The fact that the armed forces
may well be one of the key sources of illicit arms is problematic, to
say the least. In the case of the US, ATF officials are required to
submit a formal request to the Mexican Attorney General for each and
every weapon (with accompanying data on the firearm type/caliber). As a
result, [[most weapons are simply not traced and abusers go
unpunished]{.mark}.]{.underline} The development of a more effective
system for tracing the origins of illicit firearms is a priority for
both the US and Mexican governments[. [The]{.mark} current [approach is
deeply inefficient]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Mexico wants to do more to
stop the shooting, it cannot afford to keep asking questions later.

### Ext -- gun violence impact

#### Don't vote on util -- every life on earth is already at risk due to excessive gun exports

As the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives considers
legislation to stem gun violence, including proposals to ban assault
weapons and high-capacity magazines, **[[it is
crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}** that they also consider action [[to
control and reduce]{.mark} the explosive growth of [weapons
exports]{.mark} to countries all over the world]{.underline}. One such a
proposal is a bill by Representative Norma Torres (D-CA) to prohibit the
transfer of gun export licensing from the State Department to Commerce
Department. Several lawmakers, led by Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ),
have proposed similar legislation in the Senate. [[More is
required]{.underline}]{.mark}. Congress should hold hearings [on the
devastating atrocities committed with these weapons]{.underline}.
Organizations working [[to reduce]{.mark} gun violence should expand
their sights to stopping violence from [U.S. guns exported beyond
our]{.mark} militarized [borders. **The lives of people all over the
world hang in the balance**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Ext -- gun violence ethics

#### Even if they win alternative causes to violence in Mexico, you still have an ethical obligation to vote aff 

**Karlin '12** (Mark, Senior writer for Truthout.org, "Murder
Incorporated: Guns, the NRA and the Politics of Violence on the Mexican
Border," 3/20/12,
https://truthout.org/articles/murder-incorporated-guns-the-nra-and-the-politics-of-violence-on-the-mexican-border/)

Indeed, according to CBS News, many [[State Department-approved]{.mark},
military-assault-style [weapons sales result in arming the cartels due
to the cross-pollination between corrupt segments of the Mexican army
and the cartels]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even the National Shooting Sports
Foundation's Larry Keane told CBS News, "There have been 150,000 or more
Mexican soldiers defect to go work for the cartels, and I think it's
safe to assume that when they defect they take their firearms with
them." It has also been argued that the Mexican army has played a
significant role in the shooting of civilians, and that, at least in
some cases, they used guns sold to them by US companies. Furthermore,
Bowden and Molloy make the case that even if a lot of guns stopped
coming from the United States, the cartels and the Mexican government
have billions of dollars to find other suppliers. Bowden and Molloy, who
shared with Truthout their concerns that the issue of guns being
supplied from the United States should not divert attention from the
Mexican government's role in the ongoing Mexican killings, may very well
be correct. [[But regardless of whether the number of guns from the US
is 90 percent]{.mark}, 70 percent, [or]{.mark} even [50 percent]{.mark}
[or less]{.mark} of the cartels,' Mexican military's and "law
enforcement's" firepower -- and [regardless of whether these]{.mark}
same [parties]{.mark} who kill civilians [have]{.mark} vast [financial
resources]{.mark} to buy firearms from other nations -- **[at the
current moment, isn't it the moral obligation of the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to limit its role in enabling]{.mark}
the war-zone number of [killings in Mexico]{.mark}?** [This is one of
the **tacit deals** that underlies US]{.mark} drugs and gun
[policy]{.mark}: we buy the drugs from Mexico, and the cartels buy many
of their guns from us via straw purchasers and other illicit acquisition
or with State Department sanction for the military and
police]{.underline}. [Disregard the political rhetoric; this is the
reality in this grim exchange of goods, whatever "the collateral
damage]{.underline}."

### Ext -- framing 

#### Reject util, don't sacrifice the lives of those suffering now to save lives later

Civilians in Contemporary War", doesn't say page numbers, RR)

[[Human life is infinitely valuable. A single human life is infinitely
valuable, or at a minimum incalculably valuable]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[These [statements]{.mark}]{.underline} may prove difficult to defend,
and yet they [are [worth exploring in a]{.mark} planetary [environment
in which human lives are easily]{.mark} [discounted or considered
valueless]{.mark}.]{.underline} This inquiry runs the risk of becoming
mawkish or sentimental, and yet [[because]{.mark} [there are so many
voices]{.mark} and forces [that]{.mark} imply or [state]{.mark} that
[human lives have no value, it is important to make this effort]{.mark},
particularly at a time when national leaders speak casually about
killing large numbers of people who are different from them in race or
religious affiliation.]{.underline} [It is important to make a case that
[there is something uniquely valuable about every single human
existence]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2016, the Black Lives Matter movement
raised public awareness of the extent to which the news and the courts
overlook the deaths of black American citizens who are killed in street
violence and often by police forces. Over one hundred African Americans
died at the hands of police in 2015. The toll in 2016 was better
publicized and was rising rapidly. There was once hope that the nation
had entered a place of post-racial peace. While the idea of a
"post-racial" Obama period was fanciful, in the sense that centuries of
racism and racist enculturation do not instantly disappear, the fact
that Americans could speak about such a possibility at all indicated,
for a brief moment, a hope that the United States had actually taken a
definitive if not final step toward addressing and even eradicating
racism. The continuation of mass incarceration of African Americans and
the continuing killing of African Americans in the streets show that
those hopes were wrong. African Americans constitute about 11% of the
American population but upwards of 40% of the American prison
population. White activists have responded to the Black Lives Matter
movement with the claim that all lives matter. Of course all lives
matter. The fact, however, is that African American people have been
targeted for too long and their deaths have not in fact raised much
concern, compared to the concern often expressed for the lives of
others. Neither has mass incarceration raised much concern in the United
States until recently. This is part of a wider and well-known phenomenon
one can see in any disaster headline. [[A plane goes down, and an
American newspaper focuses on the fact that three Americans were on
board]{.mark}. A French paper notes the three French on board. People
tend to care more about those who look like them.]{.underline}
Kohlberg's moral development theory tells us as much. [Most
[people]{.mark}, most of the time, [focus on those who are]{.mark} just
[like them]{.mark}, and [therefore their ideas about what is moral tend
to be applied]{.mark} [only to people who look like
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The deaths of one hundred wedding guests in
a Pakistani village erroneously targeted by a hellfire missile fired
from a drone do not matter much in most of the world press. Those
innocent victims can always be reclassified as suspected or potential
enemies. Or they can simply be forgotten as insignificant. [Racism is a
fact of our existence]{.mark}.]{.underline} The deaths of close to
500,000 in the ongoing war for independence in Papua-New Guinea hardly
merits a column in a paper. What general principle can be invoked to
make the case that every single life truly matters, infinitely matters?
Human lives have been destroyed in great numbers through wars,
holocausts and pogroms, through civil violence and by many other means.
[[We are accustomed to discounting the loss of
life]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is worth repeating a familiar example for
the sake of emphasis. [A jihadist is killed by a drone strike, though
upwards of [100]{.mark} "[innocent" civilians die]{.mark} in the same
attack. Perhaps those additional dead were co-conspirators, or fellow
travelers, or implicated in some other way.]{.underline} [Perhaps [they
were merely part of the unimportant others whose lives do not
matter]{.mark}]{.underline}, unimportant others who often speak
languages that are not widely known, or whose dress or forms of
government differ significantly from those dominant in much of the
world. Once people are dead on the ground, they have no ability to
explain that they were wedding guests, not members of a terrorist cell.
Upwards of half a million people died in Iraq because of the destruction
of infrastructure; those are sad losses. Still, one can rationalize,
because no one can guarantee noncombatant immunity when target nations
are incapable of restoring basic services in a timely manner. [Police
use fatal violence to subdue an African American man wielding a butter
knife, as happened recently in Seattle, or to kill a Native American
carving a stick with his pocket knife, as happened recently in Seattle.
Each of us develops a mental program to dismiss such events. The man
with the butter knife was black and mentally ill. The Native American
had an alcohol problem.]{.underline} These defects of health can be
taken as reasons why they deserved to die, or at least why they were
more deserving of death than people who are white and without any
obvious mental impairment. For the second time in about five decades,
the Seattle Police Department is under federal review because of racial
profiling and excessive use of force. In another American city, on July
20, 2016, a black social-service worker, lying on his back with his arms
in the air, was shot while explaining to police that the man next to him
was autistic, did not have a gun, and was holding a toy truck. The
police officer later said that he did not know why he had shot the black
therapist. At the turn of the twentieth century, the once-popular
German-Jewish philosopher Joseph Popper (known by his pseudonym Lynkeus
and often referred to as Joseph Popper-Lynkeus) published a short book
titled The Individual and the Value of Human Life. Freud acknowledged
that Popper had scooped his theory of dreams. Einstein was impressed by
his ideas. The political philosopher and philosopher of science Karl
Popper was honored to be considered a possible relation.
Popper-Lynkeus's work is difficult to find now, especially outside the
original German. (Popper-Lynkeus will be referred to as Popper, from now
on, except when there is reason to distinguish him from his better-known
peer Karl Raimund Popper, the political philosopher and philosopher of
science.) Popper advanced a radical proposition in the form of a moral
absolute. To understand just what he attempted, it will be necessary to
say a few words along the way about different kinds of ethical theories.
Popper's short book is a defense of the following proposition, as
translated into English by the late American professor of philosophy
Joram Graf Haber: [[The obliteration of any individual who has not
willfully or forcibly endangered another, even if that individual is
thought to be "insignificant," is a much more important event than all
the political, religious, and national events, and all scientific,
artistic, and technical progress of all centuries and people taken
together]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whoever thinks this is an exaggeration
should imagine that he himself or someone he loves is that obliterated
individual and he will immediately understand this principle. (Haber,
xiii) Assuredly, in some respects this is an absolute moral principle
that has so many large holes in it that one could drive a truck through
it. The conditions set on the principle are amazingly broad. Anyone who
has driven a car to the market has in some sense willfully and forcibly
endangered others, because hydrocarbon pollution is carcinogenic and
carbon pollution increases global warming with potentially catastrophic
and irreversible effects. Any well-educated person knows these facts.
Therefore, to choose to drive a car to the market rather than walking is
a crime on Popper's view. This objection to Popper's principle raises a
matter that will be important later in this book: the differences among
primary, secondary, and tertiary effects of actions. If I drive to the
store with the intention of getting groceries efficiently, I probably do
not mean deliberately to harm anyone. However, the pollution I create
can have lasting deleterious effects on the health of people in my local
area, a secondary effect. More broadly, a tertiary effect of my drive to
the store is my car's and my own contribution to atmospheric carbon,
which may lead to the rise of the sea and the deaths of people in
low-lying islands or coastal areas. The principle, as Popper states it,
also leaves little room for redemption. Once I have committed such an
act, I am in the category of those who have endangered others. Nothing
can remove me from that category, and from that point on my life is one
of those that can more acceptably be obliterated. However, there is a
kernel to Popper's proposal that deserves more attention and respect.
Like the ethical theorist John Rawls, Popper argued that every human
being deserves a minimum standard of living, because each life is
valuable. It is Rawls who proposed the "invisible veil" test for ethical
principles. On this theory, you can choose any ethical system you want,
so long as you agree to live under it with the understanding that when
you are born into this world you cannot choose your race, ethnicity,
gender, intelligence, family wealth, state of health or disability, or
other factors of your existence. Rawls' ethical theory can be viewed as
an expansion of the principle that you should do unto others as you
would have them act toward you. In another passage, Popper suggests that
in the case of a dire famine, when it may be impossible for everyone to
live, it would be appropriate to cast lots to choose babies who would
die so that others may survive. There is a hint of a rationale here for
assigning higher value to some lives. This may or may not have been
Popper's intention. However, it can be argued that newborns barely have
self-awareness, and they have not accumulated perceptions, judgments,
and thoughts about the world, humanity and the state of the cosmos. What
makes an individual life valuable, perhaps, is the unique set of
perceptions, ideas, and experiences that an individual possesses, a
unique perspective on the universe. Alternatively, of course, one could
argue that human potential is the key to our value, and hence the life
of a baby should be worth more, say, than the life of an older person
who is not productive. And Popper may have been thinking of another
rationale entirely: that those who have lived longer have a network of
connections. Popper's argument can of course be extended to support the
positions of the ethicist Peter Singer. Many species of animals have
perceptions, emotions, memories, tool-making abilities, abilities to
form hypotheses, and so forth. The purpose of this book is not to
advocate vegetarianism or to explore the many ways in which humans
behave savagely toward farm animals, though such positions might well
follow from Popper's principle. Whatever Popper's complete rationale
might have been if he had worked it out more fully, he presents his
principle as a "self-evident truth" by proposing the test that anyone
ask whether he or she would be willing to be sacrificed, or to sacrifice
a loved one, for any work of art or scientific discovery, or the
totality of art and science. Popper allows that some people might indeed
choose to make such a sacrifice; however, he objects that no one should
ever be forced to make such a sacrifice. No one should be conscripted
into an army, to use one of his examples. [[No parent should]{.mark} be
forced to [kill a child so that some principle]{.mark}, say Einstein's
basic relativity equation, [should be]{.mark} [saved]{.mark}. After all,
[someone else might eventually rediscover]{.mark} Einstein's theory of
relativity. [No one]{.mark}, on the other hand, [can]{.mark} [remake a
human life]{.mark}.]{.underline} Popper's moral absolutism naturally
calls for comparison with Kant's idea of a categorical imperative, and
Popper's principle is open to the same kinds of objections that are made
to Kant. Kant, for example, argued that if it is wrong to lie, it is
wrong to lie at all times and in all circumstances. A typical objection
to Kant is to imagine a situation where a good Austrian couple is
housing a Jewish family in their basement during World War II. The
Gestapo come to the door and ask if there are Jews in the house. Should
the head of the household tell the truth, or should the head of the
household compromise his or her ethical principle? Kant's point is that
once one compromises on an absolute principle, everything becomes
relative. A person who lies once for a good reason is a person who may
lie again, and hence that person's word is fatally compromised. Many
people, however, affirm what is called a "weak absolutist" position:
absolutes that hold except in extraordinary situations. The fact that
the Austrian householder lies to the Gestapo does not totally compromise
his or her truthfulness. That particular lie was, on balance, morally
justified. In Popper's case, while he asserts his principle as an
absolute, he allows that individuals have the right to sacrifice
themselves for a work of art or an idea. They do not, however, have the
right to sacrifice others. [The virtue of Popper's moral absolute is
that it points out the circularity and the self-contradiction of
arguments that call for the sacrifice of human life. If human life has
value, then [it is contradictory to call for the obliteration of human
lives in order to save human lives.]{.mark} Moreover, [if human life
itself is the ultimate value, then it becomes difficult to]{.mark}
[argue that human]{.mark} lives [should be sacrificed for]{.mark}
abstractions or [ideals such as "democracy" or "freedom]{.mark}" or
"national honor" or any similar notion, much less for a formula or for a
painting.]{.underline} Popper admired many individual Christians and
charitable Christian groups, but he disdained Christianity as a system
for at least two reasons. One was the tendency of Christian belief to
focus not on present existence, on human life as it is, but rather on
some hypothetical future existence to which this life should be
sacrificed. For Popper, the abstract idea of another world was not a
sufficient rationale to sacrifice anything in this life. Second, like
Bertrand Russell, Popper rued the long history of Christian violence
against other Christians and against people of other faiths or no faith.
The same reasoning could be applied with equal justice to Islam and to
other religious and cultural traditions. [Consequently, Popper rejects
religious foundations for ethics, asserting instead his statement that
[life has absolute value]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whether one is inclined
or not to accept Popper's principle, what he calls his "motto," his
thinking helps to mark a line between absolutist and consequentialist
moral thinking. [On a consequentialist view, one asks what the outcome
is if one takes an action. If I sacrifice this individual in a medical
experiment with the certain knowledge that the sacrifice will be the
last experiment necessary to find the cure to all cancers, then does not
the outcome justify the action? One will die so that millions may live.
[A key difficulty with consequentialist perspectives is the problem of
limiting the time over which an action is judged]{.mark}. While
[it]{.mark} [may be true]{.mark}, for example, [that sacrificing this
person today will lead to a cure for all cancers]{.mark}, [it may also
be true that sacrificing a duck or a worm tomorrow will provide the same
research data]{.mark}. [Alternatively, it may be true that sacrificing
this person today will encourage a culture of human experimentation that
will lead over fifty years to a holocaust]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[In any
case, the "good" sought by utilitarian or other consequentialist ethical
systems is some kind of absolute calculated at some particular moment in
time]{.mark}.]{.underline} So one is back to defining some absolute
measure. An additional argument is commonly used to support
consequentialist moral reasoning. The idea may be slightly abstract,
though we encounter it on a daily basis. [There is a lack of symmetry in
arguments that one must make an absolute sacrifice now, because there is
nothing absolute about the time frame in which one is asked to make the
sacrifice.]{.underline} [In other words, [the moral choice is presented
as an absolute, though the time in which the moral choice is to be made
is not absolute.]{.mark} In public rhetoric, the "solution" to this
dilemma is to argue that this particular moment is in fact an absolute.
This is the last chance to buy a product; the last election in which it
is possible to vote for freedom]{.underline}; the End Times of
Christianity when there will be no more days for non-believers to
convert. We live under constant pressure to believe that our particular
moment of being alive is the last moment possible to make a difference.
Indeed, there may be times when the danger is so grave that there is
some truth to that proposition. Bu[t for the most part we are delusional
if we think either that we are the end of history or the only people
capable of making a positive difference.]{.underline} In favor of
Popper's principle, [one can cite any number of instances in which an
appeal to the value of a human life is made on the basis of
self-evidence.]{.underline} These instances include emotional appeals,
though it is not clear what the difference is between something labeled
an "emotional" appeal and an appeal to a self-evidentiary nature.
Aristotle's notion of a virtue, and G. E. Moore's notion of a moral
sentiment are broadly relevant here. [When we ask what actually drives
moral decisions, the answer might be a utilitarian calculation, though
it is more likely to involve reliance on patterns of ethical behavior
(virtues) or on a moral "sense" that underlies those
patterns.]{.underline} Television campaigns for donations to Amnesty
International, St. Jude's hospital, Operation Smile, and homeless
centers feature photographs either of children or of feeble older
people. [The implicit argument of these advertisements, their appeal to
moral sentiment, is that there is enormous value in these lives, so much
value that everyone must work together to assure both their survival and
a sufficient standard of living and freedom from deformity or
disease.]{.underline} [Is it appropriate or ethical to be cynical in the
face of such appeals, or do those appeals in fact constitute a
self-evident claim for the value of each human life?]{.underline} [If
the claim is not self-evident, then by what clear and well-defined
standards do we make judgments about the comparative or relative value
of human lives?]{.underline} The force of these pleas for support
suggests that in fact they do have moral power, legitimate moral power.
Moreover, t[he power of this kind of call to conscience or empathy lies
in an aspect of human experience that may be prior to critical
reasoning. In other words, the kind of moral theory that one needs to
invoke to explain this kind of call to conscience depends upon something
like moral feeling, [moral intuition, or a sense of basic virtues rather
than upon the kinds of mental calculation that is invoked by utilitarian
ethical theories.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The whole enterprise of
situational ethics and cases such as the famous trolley problem show
that there are no universally accepted moral standards.]{.underline} In
any case, our p[ublic spaces are full of precisely the kind of argument
that Popper advocates: the [intuitive judgment that every life is so
valuable that efforts must be made to preserve that life and to
guarantee that person a good level of health and
opportunity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### U.S. arms sold to Mexico fall into the wrong hands -- we are arming the cartels

Network, April 30, 2019, \[Guerrero, Jean. "Mexico\'s American Gun
Problem." KPBS Public Media, KPBS, 30 Apr. 2019,

[**[Selling weapons to Mexico - where cartel violence is out of
control]{.underline}** - **[is controversial because so many guns fall
into the wrong hands]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[due to incompetence and
corruption.]{.underline}** The Mexican military recently reported nearly
9,000 police weapons \"missing.\" **[[Yet the U.S. has approved]{.mark}
the sale of [more]{.mark} guns to Mexico in recent years [than
ever]{.mark} before through a program called \"[direct commercial
sales]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** It\'s a program that some say is worse
than the highly-criticized \"Fast and Furious\" gunrunning scandal,
where U.S. agents allowed thousands of weapons to pass from the U.S. to
Mexican drug cartels. CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl
Attkisson discovered that the official tracking all those guns sold
through \"direct commercial sales\" leaves something to be desired. One
weapon - an [AR-15-type semi-automatic rifle - tells the
story]{.underline}. [In 2006, this same kind of rifle - tracked by
serial number - is legally sold by a U.S. manufacturer to the Mexican
military. Three years later - it\'s found in a criminal stash in a
region wracked by Mexican drug cartel violence.]{.underline} That
prompted a \"sensitive\" cable, uncovered by WikiLeaks, dated June 4,
2009, in which **[the U.S. State Department asked Mexico \"how the
AR-15\" - meant only for the military or police - was \"diverted\" into
criminal hands.]{.underline}** And, more importantly, where the other
rifles from the same shipment went: \"Please account for the current
location of the 1,030 AR-15 type rifles,\" reads the cable. There\'s no
response in the record. The problem of weapons legally sold to Mexico -
then diverted to violent cartels - is becoming more urgent. That\'s
because **[[the U.S. has quietly authorized a massive escalation
in]{.mark} the number of [guns sold to Mexico through \"direct
commercial sales]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** **[It\'s a way foreign
countries can acquire firearms faster and with less disclosure than
going through the Pentagon.]{.underline}** Here\'s how it works: A
foreign government fills out an application to buy weapons from private
gun manufacturers in the U.S. Then the State Department decides whether
to approve. And it did approve 2,476 guns to be sold to Mexico in 2006.
In 2009, that number was up nearly 10 times, to 18,709. The State
Department has since stopped disclosing numbers of guns it approves, and
wouldn\'t give CBS News figures for 2010 or 2011. **[[With Mexico in a
virtual]{.mark} state of [war with its]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[cartels]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nobody\'s tracking how **[[many U.S.
guns are ending up with the enemy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** \"I think most
Americans are aware that there\'s a problem in terms of the drug
traffickers in Mexico, increases in violence,\" said Bill Hartung, an
arms control advocate with the Arms and Security Project at the Center
for International Policy. \"I don\'t think they realize that we\'re
sending so many guns there, and that some of them may be diverted to the
very cartels that we\'re trying to get under control.\" **[The State
Department audits only]{.underline}** a tiny sample - **[less than 1
percent of sales]{.underline}** - **[but]{.underline}** the results are
disturbing: In 2009, **[more than a quarter]{.underline}** (26 percent)
**[of the guns sold]{.underline}** to the region that includes Mexico
**[were \"diverted\" into the wrong hands]{.underline}**, or had other
\"unfavorable\" results. The National Shooting Sports Foundation\'s
Larry Keane, who speaks for gun manufacturers, said he understands the
potential for abuse. \"There have been 150,000 or more Mexican soldiers
defect to go work for the cartels, and I think it\'s safe to assume that
when they defect they take their firearms with them,\" Keane told CBS
News. But Keane said the sales help the U.S. \"These sales by the
industry actually support U.S. national security interests,\" Keane told
Attkisson. \"If they didn\'t, the State Department wouldn\'t allow
them.\" \"Do they need better oversight?\" asked Attkisson.
[**\"**[It\'s]{.mark} certainly [for the State Department and the
Mexican government to]{.mark} try to [make sure]{.mark} that the
[cartels don\'t obtain firearms]{.mark} that way**,**]{.underline}\" he
replied. \"**[But that\'s really beyond the control of the
industry]{.underline}**.\" **[Mexico is now one of the world\'s largest
purchasers of U.S. guns through direct commercial sales, beating
out]{.underline}** countries like **[Iraq]{.underline}**. The State
Department office that oversees the sales wouldn\'t agree to an
interview. But an official has told Congress their top priority is to
advance national security and foreign policy.

#### Cartels and the dynamics of transnational crime will overwhelm the state institutions of Mexico

What are the causes of Mexico's drug trafficking and violence? What is
the meaning and purpose of the war on drugs in Mexico? The conventional
answers to such questions have been presented by a number of government
officials, journalists and scholars.4 While there exist a variety of
theoretical, methodological and empirical emphases, such approaches have
all neglected the central role of political economy in their analyses.
For example, some have provided ethnographic accounts of US--Mexico drug
trafficking,5 others have interpreted the drugs war at the border as
fulfilling a symbolic political function allowing US government leaders
to show resolve to voters and Congress,6 or have studied the role of the
drugs war in militarising the US-- Mexico border,7 and have compared and
contrasted the war on narcotics with the war on immigration and homeland
security waged by the US government.8 Despite these differences, [the
mainstream interpretation shares the following components: .
[Overwhelming attention]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is directed to the drug
cartels, seen as the main]{.mark}--- or even only---[source of]{.mark}
the problem of drug [trafficking and]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. . [The US, concerned with drug use and
violence, collaborates with the Mexican authorities to reduce the
cartels' power by waging a war on drugs in Mexico. **[If lawlessness
prevails, the cartels could take over]{.mark}**]{.underline} parts of
**[[the state]{.underline}]{.mark}** and refugees could flood the US. .
A key obstacle to US plans is corruption among Mexican officials,
fuelled by the cartels, which makes it difficult to win the drugs war. .
Thus, solutions include cleaning Mexican institutions of corruption,
interdiction and arrests of drug kingpins, increasing military aid, and
promoting NAFTA-type free trade agreements to achieve economic
development. . Some [[researchers recognise]{.underline}]{.mark} that US
drug consumption and [[firearms]{.mark} smuggling [to Mexico are]{.mark}
part of [the problem]{.mark}]{.underline} and [call for [reducing
US]{.mark}]{.underline} demand for drugs and regulating [[gun
sales]{.underline}]{.mark} and trafficking. [The conventional view [thus
focuses on the drug cartels' role in causing **mayhem**]{.mark} in
Mexico [and corrupting]{.mark} its [governmental
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the JULIEN MERCILLE 1638 words of
General (ret) Barry McCaffrey, [US drug czar under Bill Clinton, [Mexico
'is fighting for survival against narco-terrorism']{.mark}]{.underline}
and we need to support 'the courageous Mexican leadership of the
Caldero´n Administration' because 'the violent, [**warring collection of
criminal [drug cartels could overwhelm the institutions of the
state']{.mark}** and we could be faced with 'a surge of millions of
refugees crossing the US border to escape the domestic misery of
violence']{.underline}.9

#### The Mexican state can fail -- economic collapse will be rapid -- undermines U.S. growth, too.

**Jones-Rooy, quantitative researcher at Five-Thirty-Eight, '17**
(Andrea, February 28, "How A Weakened Mexican Economy Could Threaten
U.S. Security,"
<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-weakened-mexican-economy-could-threaten-u-s-security/>,
date accessed 6/30/2019)//SH

President Trump has taken an aggressive stance towards Mexico, both
during his campaign and in his early days in office. He has threatened
to dismantle NAFTA, to build a border wall and to slap hefty tariffs on
Mexican imports, all moves that could hobble Mexico's economy. While the
Trump administration may argue that these policies are more about
"Making America Great Again" than [[hurting Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark},
there is reason for concern that they may also hurt us. One risk is that
the policies themselves [[could damage the American
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [for example, through higher consumer
prices and reduced trade]{.underline}. But there's a deeper risk: [[What
happens in Mexico tends to spill over into the U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And the problems may not just be economic. According to a prominent area
of research in international relations and international political
economy, a weakened Mexican economy could also pose security threats to
the U.S. Among the most robust empirical findings in international
relations is that [poor economic performance can lead to political
instability.]{.underline} [One of the most cited papers on the
subject]{.underline} is a 1996 study [by Alberto Alesina and Roberto
Perotti]{.underline} in which they [found that [economic
problems]{.mark}, including increased inequality, [fuel]{.mark} public
discontent and social [unrest.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of unrest [[increases the]{.mark}
likelihood of even more **[extreme political
instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including protests, coups and
revolutions, according to Alesina and Perotti. This dynamic has played
out in country after country. [[Economic pressures]{.mark} [were]{.mark}
part of [the drivers of the Arab Spring protests]{.mark} in Egypt and
across the region.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} current [economic
recession in Brazil]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a century of economic turmoil
in [Argentina]{.mark} [have]{.mark} both [been linked to]{.mark}
political [instability in those countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or, to
take an example of the relationship working in the reverse: [The
[Chinese]{.mark} government's primary tool for survival --- social
[stability --- depends almost entirely upon]{.mark} its ability to
maintain [economic growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. We've seen it here at
home, too: [The Great Recession that began in 2008 preceded, in quick
succession, the tea party movement and Occupy Wall Street]{.underline},
forces that are in some ways still at play today. As many of these
examples make clear, [[the effect goes the other way]{.mark},
too:]{.underline} [According to Alesina and Perotti, a weakened
economy]{.underline} --- especially when it exacerbates economic
inequality --- [leads to political instability, but political
[instability]{.mark} [also hurts the economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
inserts uncertainty into the environment, which leads to less
investment. A recent paper by Ari Aisen and Francisco José Veiga finds
that [political instability can also reduce productivity and human
capital development]{.underline}; both governments and families become
less likely to prioritize education or training. [This cycle means
political instability, once it emerges, is hard to shake]{.underline}:
[[A bad economy is politically destabilizing, which worsens the
economy,]{.mark} which is further destabilizing]{.underline}. [Syria is
an example]{.underline} of this perpetual cycle at its worst: Early
protests were met with violence, which turned into an intractable
conflict, which has all but obliterated the country's economy, which
makes political recovery even harder. Applying this to Mexico, if
Trump's policies go through, even partially, we could be looking at some
significant political and economic consequences for the country. [One of
the biggest political challenges in Mexico is corruption, which tends to
get worse under economic pressure.]{.underline}1 Officials and citizens
become more desperate, and there is weakened state capacity to combat
it. [[Drug trafficking and violent crime]{.underline}]{.mark}, also huge
problems in Mexico, [[are]{.mark} also likely to increase under [worse
economic conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} --- again, as people become
more desperate.2 The most destabilizing path is less ripe for a TV
series, but more concerning. Mexico's fledgling middle class is likely
to be squeezed by Trump's policies through price increases and
unemployment.3 This discontent could lead to protests, or the election
of a populist leader, who will promise aggressive anti-American
policies. (Sound familiar?). [Economic downturns can also heighten
conflict between social groups]{.underline} --- of which Mexico has many
--- pitting previously peacefully co-existing groups against each other.
And while Mexico's democracy has recently showed some signs of
stability, it's still on many policy watch lists, especially for [crime
and corruption]{.underline}, both of which, again, [are likely to be the
first to worsen under economic pressure]{.underline}. Maybe, though, as
Trump argues, the U.S. can no longer afford to worry about other
countries' well-being --- the U.S. has plenty of its own concerns, after
all. Fair enough, but [Mexico's woes are unlikely to stop at the Rio
Grande]{.underline}: [[Instability can spill over
borders]{.mark}.]{.underline} There's a wholy body of research showing
this, but the paper that makes this point most clearly is a 1997 piece
by Ades and Chua. They demonstrated that [political instability in one
country hurts its entire region by disrupting trade, requiring all
countries to spend more on defense]{.underline}, and --- in the longer
term --- reducing the regional amount spent on education and other forms
of human capital accumulation. Their empirical results over an analysis
of 118 countries over a 25-year period are in the chart below. The
correlation may not look strong from an economics or finance
perspective, but it actually is quite strong from a political science
perspective, where our patterns are harder to measure and more subject
to noise. [The current conflict in Syria provides a more contemporary
and dramatic example. Terrorism, weapons trading and refugees now affect
other countries in the region]{.underline} ([and even countries outside
the region, as northern European countries have seen the effects of both
refugees and terrorism, too).]{.underline} [[**In Mexico's case, even
mild destabilization there could increase the risk of instability in the
U.**S]{.mark}.]{.underline} More discontent in Mexico as a result of a
plummeting economy will mean more angry, armed people close to or
attempting to cross U.S. borders. Weakened investment in human capital
in Mexico means either more people seeking education in the U.S. or more
unskilled workers crossing into the U.S. seeking a job. Of course, an
even more straightforward economic argument makes this case, too: A
weakened Mexican economy on its own, regardless of whether there is
political instability, will increase immigration pressure from Mexico to
the U.S. For example, in the late 1990s Mexico's economic flattening
corresponded with an immigration spike to the U.S. Since then,
immigration has gone back down. Rates are even holding steady, and more
Mexicans are repatriating, as their economy grows. Policies that reduce
Mexico's ability to export to the U.S. (which accounts for approximately
25 percent of its GDP) could cause an even more significant scenario
than the 1990s and early 2000s. More broadly, [a struggling
[Mexico]{.mark} [will]{.mark} also [be less capable of managing]{.mark}
problems such as [pollution and disease]{.mark}, [which can cross
borders]{.mark} far more easily than people]{.underline}. Another H1N1
outbreak in a weak Mexico could put many Americans at risk. [A weakened
economy is thought to be part of the reason Brazil didn't mobilize as
quickly as it otherwise might have in the early stages of the Zika
outbreak.]{.underline} Finally --- and this is speculative --- suppose
Trump's policies are enacted to their full capacity. [[This could cause
Mexico]{.mark}'s economy and political environment [to deteriorate all
the way to status of a failing state]{.mark}. Failing states are thought
by both scholars and policymakers to be potential environments for
terrorism]{.underline} (technically they increase the likelihood of
terrorism, though are not necessary or sufficient). It may be tempting
to think of these problems as far off --- Trump's policies haven't even
been put forth apart from an executive order. But, [[Mexico's economy
is]{.mark} already [showing signs of downturn]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
peso is at its lowest level ever and has undergone its biggest drop
since 1994. Protests are already breaking out (specifically against
Trump). The recent attack on a U.S. consular agent in Mexico also
suggests disturbing destabilizing trends that are already affecting the
security of Americans. The Trump administration hasn't actually done
much yet, so it's possible its eventual policies prove less damaging to
Mexico than Trump's rhetoric and early executive orders would suggest.
But both social [[science and history suggest policies that hurt Mexico
are likely to be]{.mark} politically and **[economically damaging for
the U.S., as well]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Economic slowdown risks diversionary war.

**Foster '16** \-- Dennis Foster, professor of international studies and
political science at the Virginia Military Institute, "Would President
Trump go to war to divert attention from problems at home?", Washington
Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/19/yes-trump-might-well-go-to-war-to-divert-attention-from-problems-at-home/?utm_term=.43745ac4c66c>

[[If the U.S. economy tanks]{.underline}]{.mark}, [should we
[expect]{.mark} Donald [Trump to]{.mark} engage in a diversionary war?
Since the age of Machiavelli, analysts have expected world leaders to
**[launch international conflicts to deflect popular attention]{.mark}**
away from problems at home. By stirring up feelings of patriotism,
leaders might escape the political costs of scandal, unpopularity --- or
a poorly performing economy]{.underline}. [One often-cited example of
diversionary war in modern times is Argentina's 1982 invasion of the
Falklands]{.underline}, which several (though not all) political
scientists attribute to the junta's desire to divert the people's
attention from a disastrous economy. In a 2014 article, Jonathan Keller
and I argued that whether [[U.S. presidents engage in diversionary
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} depends in part on their psychological
traits --- how they frame the world, process information and develop
plans of action. Certain traits predispose leaders to more belligerent
behavior. Do words translate into foreign policy action? One way to
identify these traits is content analyses of leaders' rhetoric. The more
leaders use certain types of verbal constructs, the more likely they are
to possess traits that lead them to use military force. For one,
conceptually simplistic leaders view the world in "black and white"
terms; they develop unsophisticated solutions to problems and are
largely insensitive to risks. Similarly, distrustful leaders tend to
exaggerate threats and rely on aggression to deal with threats.
Distrustful leaders typically favor military action and are confident in
their ability to wield it effectively. Thus, when faced with politically
damaging problems that are hard to solve --- such as a faltering economy
--- leaders who are both distrustful and simplistic are less likely to
put together complex, direct responses. Instead, they develop simplistic
but risky "solutions" that divert popular attention from the problem,
utilizing the tools with which they are most comfortable and confident
(military force). Based on our analysis of the rhetoric of previous U.S.
presidents, we found that presidents whose language appeared more
simplistic and distrustful, such as Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and
George W. Bush, were more likely to use force abroad in times of rising
inflation and unemployment. By contrast, John F. Kennedy and Bill
Clinton, whose rhetoric pegged them as more complex and trusting, were
less likely to do so. What about Donald Trump? Since Donald Trump's
election, many commentators have expressed concern about how he will
react to new challenges and whether he might make quick recourse to
military action. For example, the Guardian's George Monbiot has argued
that political realities will stymie Trump's agenda, especially his
promises regarding the economy. Then, [[rather than]{.mark} risk
[disappointing his base, Trump might try to rally]{.mark} public opinion
to his side [via military action]{.mark}.]{.underline}

well discussed. In the worst case, the U.S. would be able to isolate
itself from most effects emanating from south Asia. However, [there

### Ext -- gun sales fuel cartels

Drug violence in Mexico is not entirely homegrown[.
[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} [policies with regard to [gun sales]{.mark}
and drugs [are]{.mark} inextricably [linked with cartel violence]{.mark}
and contribute to the difficulty in bringing about an end to
[lawlessness and corruption]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.N. reports,
investigations by the U.S. government agencies, and media inquiries have
determined [many of [the weapons used by cartels originated in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, especially in border states
such as Arizona, said to have \"weakest gun violence prevention laws.\"
According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco \[\*1478\] and Firearms
and Explosives (ATF), \"by 2009 the Sinaloa drug cartel had made Phoenix
its gun supermarket and recruited young Americans as its designated
shoppers or straw purchasers.\" Some not old enough to buy alcohol
\"were plunking down as much as \$ 20,000 in cash to purchase up to 20
semiautomatics at a time, and then delivering the weapons to others.\"
Since 2006, Mexican authorities have confiscated over 60,000 [[weapons
from drug cartels purchased from U.S. gun dealers]{.underline}.]{.mark}
The Inspector General\'s investigation of the ATF scandal known as
\"Operation Fast and Furious\" revealed, as a result of \"a
dysfunctional and poorly supervised group of Arizona-based federal
prosecutors and \[ATF\] agents,\" [[hundreds of U.S. weapons passed into
the hands of Mexican drug gangs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Operation Fast and
Furious was not the first ill-fated program designed to traffic weapons
into Mexico as a sting operation. In 2006 and 2007, a program called
\"Wide Receiver\" similarly failed to track weapons and resulted in an
unknown number of guns falling into the hands of Mexican cartels, some
of which emerged from a group of elite U.S. trained Mexican soldiers to
fight insurgents in Latin America. In addition, U.S. Border Patrol and a
mayor of a town in New Mexico have been implicated in smuggling illegal
guns to Mexican cartels. \[\*1479\] U.S. drug policies further
contribute to drug violence in Mexico. Demand in the United States
provides much of the stimulus for Mexico\'s drug wars. As one noted
journalist has explained: Drugs are an old business in Mexico. Farmers
in the remote high sierra of the western state of Sinaloa have been
growing opium poppies since the late 19th century - and marijuana long
before that - but smuggling did not become a viable enterprise until the
US created an illicit market by regulating the use of opiates in 1914.
Then, as now, drugs flowed one way: north. Mexicans also use illicit
drugs, and more so in recent years. However, illegal drug use in Latin
America, including those countries that produce drugs, is notably less
than in the United States. Mexico\'s response to drug use is largely a
function of the heavy hand of U.S. drug policy, particularly since the
1970s when President Richard Nixon first declared the \"War on Drugs\" -
a declaration with extraterritorial reach. The U.S. government succeeded
in pressuring Mexico to rely on its military apparatus to curtail drug
trafficking notwithstanding the widespread knowledge that [[Mexico\'s
federal troops were guilty of committing heinous human rights
abuses]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Ext -- cartels collapse Mexico

#### Cartels can overtake the Mexican state

**Bonner, '10** (Senior Principal of the Sentinel HS Group. He was
Administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from 1990 to
1993 and Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 2001 to
2005, The New Cocaine Cowboys, Foreign Affairs, July/August)

The [recent headlines from Mexico are disturbing]{.underline}: U.S.
consular official gunned down in broad daylight; Rancher murdered by
Mexican drug smuggler; Bomb tossed at U.S. consulate in Nuevo Laredo.
This wave of violence is eerily reminiscent of the carnage that plagued
Colombia 20 years ago, and it is getting Washington's attention.
**[[Mexico is in the throes of]{.mark} a [battle against]{.mark}
powerful [drug cartels, the outcome of which will determine]{.mark} who
controls [the country's]{.mark} law enforcement, judicial, and
[political institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It will decide whether
the state will destroy the cartels and put an end to the culture of
impunity they have created. [Mexico could become a first-world country
one day, but it will never achieve that status until it breaks the grip
these criminal organizations have over all levels of government and
strengthens its law enforcement and judicial institutions]{.underline}.
It cannot do one without doing the other. [Destroying the drug cartels
is not an impossible task]{.underline}. Two decades ago, Colombia was
faced with a similar---and in many ways more daunting---struggle. In the
early 1990s, many Colombians, including police officers, judges,
presidential candidates, and journalists, were assassinated by the most
powerful and fearsome drug-trafficking organizations the world has ever
seen: the Cali and Medellín cartels. Yet within a decade, the Colombian
government defeated them, with Washington's help. The United States
played a vital role in supporting the Colombian government, and it
should do the same for Mexico. [[The stakes in Mexico are high. If the
cartels win,]{.mark} these [criminal enterprises will continue]{.mark}
to operate outside the state and the rule of law, [undermining Mexico's
democracy]{.mark}. The outcome matters for the]{.underline} United
[S]{.underline}tates as well---if the drug cartels succeed, [the
U]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will share a]{.mark}
2,000-mile [border with a narcostate controlled by powerful]{.mark}
transnational drug [cartels that threaten]{.mark} the [stability of
Central and South America.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### America's gun exports contributes to global militarism subsequent and state failure -- Mexico is a tipping point

weaponisation of the US,"
https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/countingthecost/2018/11/gun-economics-weaponisation-181103081424809.html

[[America\'s gun industry \"has a massive impact in the
world]{.underline}]{.mark},\" explains Feinstein. \"First, **[[it
creates this global environment of militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The US is involved in more conflicts than any other country on the
planet. In fact, the US government employs more people to run one
aircraft carrier than it has diplomats across the entire world and the
United States today has 11 aircraft carriers. [[How that affects
America\'s immediate neighbours is even more insidious]{.mark}.\" \"So,
[a country like Mexico that has certain law and order problems]{.mark}
relating to the drugs trade and gun running. The vast majority of those
guns in Mexico used by militias, used by criminals - both organised and
informal, come from the United States of America]{.underline}.\" \"So,
while Donald Trump talks about building a wall, what he doesn\'t seem to
realise is there\'s an enormous and very profitable flow of guns into
Mexico from the US that he probably wouldn\'t want to stop. [[So you
have a flow of guns]{.underline}]{.mark} into Mexico [[and in
return]{.underline}]{.mark}, you have a flow of drugs and other illicit
activities into the US. So what this is doing is, [[it\'s
destabilising]{.mark} those [neighbouring countries]{.mark} like
Mexico]{.underline} \... and it\'s having a devastating impact on the
US,\" says Feinstein.

### Ext -- failed states impact

Failed states non-unique every impact -- anything can happen, including
disease, terrorism, regional conflict, hunger, poverty, human rights
abuse, WMD proliferation, genocide, and broader war

**Manwaring, '5** (Max G., Retired U.S. Army colonel and an Adjunct
Professor of International Politics at Dickinson College, venezuela's
hugo chávez, bolivarian socialism, and asymmetric warfare, October 2005,
pg. PUB628.pdf)

President Chávez also understands that the process leading to [[state
failure is the most dangerous]{.mark} long-term [security challenge
facing the global community]{.mark} today]{.underline}. The argument in
general is that failing and [[failed state]{.mark} [status]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [the breeding ground for instability,]{.mark} criminality[,
insurgency, regional conflict,]{.mark} [and
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}. These conditions breed massive
humanitarian disasters and major refugee flows. [They can host "evil"
networks of all kinds, whether they involve criminal business
enterprise, narco-trafficking, or some form of ideological
crusade]{.underline} such as *Bolivarianismo.* More specifically, these
conditions spawn all kinds of things people in general do not like such
as murder, kidnapping, corruption, intimidation, and destruction of
infrastructure. [[These]{.mark} means of coercion and persuasion [can
spawn]{.mark} further [human rights violations, torture, poverty,
starvation, disease]{.mark}]{.underline}, the recruitment and use of
child soldiers, trafficking in women and body parts, [trafficking [and
proliferation of conventional weapons]{.mark} systems [and WMD,
genocide, ethnic cleansing]{.mark}, warlordism, [and criminal
anarchy.]{.mark}]{.underline} At the same time, [[these]{.mark} actions
are usually unconfined and [spill over into regional syndromes
of]{.mark} [poverty]{.mark}, [destabilization, and
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.62 Peru's *Sendero Luminoso* calls violent
and destructive activities that facilitate the processes of state
failure "armed propaganda." Drug cartels operating throughout the Andean
Ridge of South America and elsewhere call these activities "business
incentives." [Chávez considers these actions to be steps that must be
taken to bring about the political conditions necessary to establish
Latin American socialism for the 21st century]{.underline}.63 Thus, in
addition to helping to provide wider latitude to further their tactical
and operational objectives, state and nonstate actors' strategic efforts
are aimed at progressively lessening a targeted regime's credibility and
capability in terms of its ability and willingness to govern and develop
its national territory and society. [[Chávez's intent is to focus his
primary attack]{.mark} politically and psychologically [on selected

govern.]{.mark}]{.underline} In that context, he understands that
popular perceptions of corruption, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack
of upward mobility limit the right and the ability of a given regime to
conduct the business of the state. Until a given populace generally
perceives that its government is dealing with these and other basic
issues of political, economic, and social injustice fairly and
effectively, [[instability]{.mark} and the threat of subverting or
[destroying such a government are real]{.mark}.64]{.underline} But
failing and failed states simply do not go away. Virtually anyone can
take advantage of such an unstable situation. The tendency is that the
best motivated and best armed organization on the scene will control
that instability. As a consequence, [failing and failed states become
dysfunctional states, rogue states, criminal states,
narco-states]{.underline}, or new people's democracies. In connection
with the creation of new people's democracies, one can rest assured that
Chávez and his Bolivarian populist allies will be available to provide
money, arms, and leadership at any given opportunity. And, of course,
[[the longer dysfunctional,]{.mark} rogue, criminal, and
narco[-states]{.mark} and people's democracies [persist, the more they

and prosperity.65]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since 2014, a significant number of asylum seekers and vulnerable people
have fled violence and instability south of the U.S. border, primarily
from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras (a region collectively referred to
as the \"Northern Triangle\"), and Mexico. The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (\"UNHCR\") has called the situation a
\"protection crisis,\" noting that [[violence has]{.mark}
[surged]{.mark} to levels not seen since the region was wracked by armed
conflicts in the 1980]{.underline}s, which has resulted in asylum
application numbers from these countries reaching levels not seen since
that time.

[[Current murder rates]{.mark} in the Northern Triangle [are among the
highest ever recorded]{.mark}]{.underline} in the these countries, with
the cities of San Salvador, Tegucigalpa, and San Pedro Sula ranking as
three of the most dangerous cities in the world. This has led many to
classify the Northern Triangle as the world\'s most deadly region
outside an official war zone[. [In addition to]{.mark} \[\*10\] [rising
homicide rates, there has also been a stark escalation in the level of
human rights abuses perpetrated]{.mark},]{.underline} [including child
recruitment into gangs and gender-based and sexual violence. Moreover,
it is well-documented that [those]{.mark} [fleeing]{.mark} the region in
an effort to reach the United States [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[victimized by]{.mark} [criminal enterprises,]{.mark} sometimes [in
collusion or complicity of national authorities, and subjected to
violence]{.mark} and other abuses, including [abduction, extortion,
torture, and rape]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to a survey conducted
by Doctors Without Borders, of migrants and refugees fleeing Central
America, approximately seventy percent of those interviewed reported
being victims of violence in transit to the United States, with
one-third of women reporting that they had been sexually assaulted.

Additionally, [[Mexico is grappling with one of its worst periods of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the past decade, approximately
[[150,000 people have been murdered and]{.mark} another [30,000 are
missing]{.mark}. According the U.S. State Department, **[the \"most
significant human rights\" abuses in Mexico were related to those
perpetrated by law enforcement and the military]{.mark}**, as well as
organized criminal groups killing, kidnapping and threatening citizens,
immigrants, journalists, and human rights defenders. [These abuses have
also been well-reported by]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations
[officials, as well as human rights organizations]{.mark}, who have
found that [impunity for these crimes and other harms \"remain almost
absolute]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Furthermore, gender-based violence and
abuse due to sexual orientation is widespread.

**[[another 28 in 2015 and 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to

Bushmaster xm15 rifles [approached the vehicle of the mayor's
bodyguards]{.mark}]{.underline}**, ordering them to identify themselves.
When they did not answer, the police **[[opened fire twice, killing
them.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

• In Veracruz, the police responsible for at least 15 death squad
murders44 purchased, since 2013, at least 674 firearms exported by three
u.s. arms companies: Colt, Bushmaster, and Com- bined Systems, according
to the Veracruz public security secretariat. Local police in Veracruz
also obtained weapons from Sig Sauer and Connecticut-based Mossberg.45

• In Tamaulipas in 2011, a man was arrested for belonging to a criminal
organization and brought to a military installation. While in custody, a
navy lieutenant responsible for the detainee killed with him with a shot
to the head, according to the court sentence. The firearm used was a
5.56 Colt M16 rifle.46

respect for human rights and the rule of law."]{.underline} Launched in
2007, the initiative is formally focused on (1) disrupting organized
criminal groups, (2) institutionalizing the rule of law, (3) creating a
21st-century border, and (4) building strong and resilient communities
in Mexico. According to a January 2016 report by the Congressional

and trafficking of heroin in Mexico."]{.underline}15 [Most of the \$2.1

counter-drug equipment and **training for Mexican police
agencies**,]{.underline} including \$590 million worth of aircraft. In
addition to U.S. grant assistance to Mexico, most of which is channeled
to U.S. companies, [the United States has also approved the **transfer
through sales of billions of dollars' worth of other arms** to the
Mexican government]{.underline}. According to The Washington Post,
[[the]{.mark} value of [weapons]{.mark} and military equipment sold was
\$**3.5 billion** from 2012 to 2015 and [included firearms, armored
vehicles, helicopters, and other military
aircraft]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 "We didn't sell them just the
helicopters," a former Pentagon official on Mexico policy told The New
York Times. "We sold them 15 years of working intimately together that
we would not otherwise have."17 [Whatever the pretext or mode of
delivery, [the evidence is strong that]{.mark} such [U.S. military
transfers contribute significantly to **violence, instability, and the
denial of human rights**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Because]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the depth of [corruption]{.mark} in the
Mexican government, [police and armed forces blur the lines between
official groups and criminals]{.mark}, [and legal arms sales
**frequently** end up arming criminal gangs]{.mark} and criminal conduct
[directly]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Moreover, the Mexican police and
military have a long history of repression against mostly peaceful
social movements]{.underline}. [In 2013 alone, the United States
exported to Mexico 5,810 revolvers and pistols, 7,223 rifles, 30 assault
rifles, 1,311 machine guns, 7,145 shotguns, 34 grenade launchers, and 20
anti-tank missile launchers]{.underline}, according to data reported to
the United Nations. [Among these weapons were U.S.-produced and exported
rifles used by the police who attacked and handed over 43 student
teachers from Ayotzinapa to a local criminal gang in September
2014]{.underline}. [Documents]{.underline} from the Mexican defense
ministry's arms registry [include the weapons possessed by municipal
police in Iguala, who carried out the crime. Among the arms listed: 20
assault rifles produced by Colt's Manufacturing]{.underline},
[headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut]{.underline}. Colt sold the
Mexican government those rifles, which arrived in Guerrero in 2013.18
[[U.S. Embassy staff assured us that police who]{.mark} are shown to
[have committed]{.mark} grave [human rights abuses are barred from
receiving U.S. training]{.mark}. [But the restriction apparently does
not apply to police receiving U.S.-exported
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[An increasing amount of arms sales to
Mexico are made]{.mark} directly by the United States government,
[through]{.mark} its **[Foreign Military Sales
program]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [rather than in commercial transactions
with the producers, known as Direct Commercial Sales, even though those
producers still profit from the sales.]{.underline} These governmental
sales do not count the assault rifles and other firearms sold at retail
stores and gun shows in the United States and smuggled into Mexico.
[Paulina Arriaga, executive director of Desarma Mexico]{.underline}
(desarmamexico.org), [told us that one can't talk about arms in Mexico
without talking about the United States.]{.underline} For example, the
end of the assault weapons ban in 2004 provoked a spike in the presence
of such weapons in Mexico.19 [[Seventy percent of firearms seized in
criminal investigations in Mexico come from the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}, according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms. In fact, [Arriaga says the U.S. is "without a
doubt the primary provider of legal and illegal arms in
Mexico]{.underline}." [Those weapons contributed to some 65 percent of
the nearly 15 million "common crimes" committed in Mexico from 2011 to
2013]{.underline}, and roughly 56 percent of the 57,000 homicides
committed since 2013. Of the U.S.-sourced guns seized by authorities at
crime scenes in Mexico, up to a half of them were imported into the
United States from other nations, according to a Violence Policy Center
report. If the United States restricted imports of assault weapons, it
could reduce the flow of such weapons to Mexico, even without a full
U.S. legislative ban on the sale of assault weapons.20 While the United
States has the biggest external role in Mexico's militarization, other
countries also contribute to and benefit from it, including Spain, the
Netherlands, France, Canada, and Germany. In the display showcases that
we saw at the Mexican Secretary of National Defense (SEDENA), guns
manufactured by companies from the United States,21 Israel,22 Italy,
Slovakia, China, and the Czech Republic are offered to private security
companies and federal, state, and local police forces shopping for
weapons. German arms sales to Mexico demonstrate both how exported arms
are used in atrocities and how exporting states can seek to exercise
controls. The German firm Heckler and Koch sold nearly tenthousand G-36
assault rifles to Mexico between 2006 and 2009, on the condition that
they not send them to the conflictive states of Chihuahua, Guerrero,
Jalisco, and Chiapas. Yet dozens of the rifles were recovered from the
Iguala municipal police who participated in the disappearance of the 43
Ayotzinapa students in September 2014. In response, German prosecutors
charged six Heckler and Koch employees with criminal violations, and
German officials visited Mexico to request forgiveness of family members
of the Ayotzinapa students.

#### Failure to protect human rights makes extinction inevitable 

**Human Rights Web '94** (An Introduction to the Human Rights Movement
Created on July 20, 1994 / Last edited on January 25, 1997,
http://www.hrweb.org/intro.html)

The United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and
UN Human Rights convenants were written and implemented in the aftermath
of the Holocaust, revelations coming from the Nuremberg war crimes
trials, the Bataan Death March, the atomic bomb, and other horrors
smaller in magnitude but not in impact on the individuals they affected.
A whole lot of people in a number of countries had a crisis of
conscience and found they could no longer look the other way while
tyrants jailed, tortured, and killed their neighbors. Many also realized
that advances in technology and changes in social structures had
rendered war a threat to the continued existence of the human race.
[[Large numbers of people in many countries lived under the control of
tyrants, having no recourse but war]{.mark} to relieve often intolerable
living conditions. Unless some way was found to relieve the lot of these
people, [they could revolt and become the catalyst for another
wide-scale and possibly nuclear war.]{.mark}]{.underline} For perhaps
the first time, representatives from the majority of governments in the
world came to the conclusion that [basic [human rights must be
protected,]{.mark} not only for the sake of the individuals and
countries involved, but [to preserve the human
race]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Vote to uphold human rights because the world is hot garbage

**Pierik '2** (Roland, Tillburg University Law School + Visiting
Scholar, Department of Philosophy @ Columbia University, \"Book review,
forthcoming in the Leiden Journal of International Law,\"
http://www.rolandpierik.nl/theory/Downloads/WPHR.pdf)

The chapters discuss a large variety of issues, but the central thought
can be summarized as follows: [[we]{.mark}, the governments and citizens
of affluent democracies, [have a]{.mark} negative [duty]{.mark} not [to
uphold]{.mark} a global structure that violates [human
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pogge's position can be characterized as
'moral institutional cosmopolitanism.' Let me elaborate this
characterization by explaining the constituting parts. First, Pogge
explicates a moral instead of legal notion of human rights (53). His
defense is inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
especially art. 25 − claiming that everyone has the right to a standard
of living adequate for health and well-being − and art. 28 − claiming
that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which
the rights and freedoms of the UDHR can be fully realized. Secondly,
Pogge understands human rights not in an interactional but in an
institutional way: On the interactional understanding of human rights,
governments and individuals have a responsibility not to violate human
rights. On my institutional understanding, by contrast, their
responsibility is to work for an institutional order and public culture
that ensure that all members of society have secure access to the
objects of their human rights. ... By postulating a human right to X,
one is asserting that any society or other social system, insofar as
this is reasonably possible, ought to be so (re)organized that all its
members have secure access to X . Pogge explicitly understands human
rights in an institutional way: human rights are primarily claims
against coercive social institutions, and secondarily claims against
individuals that uphold (and benefit from) such institutions. Finally,
[Pogge's defense is a cosmopolitan one, centering "on the fundamental
needs and interests of human beings and all human beings," and
emphasizing "that [every human being has a global stature as an ultimate
unit of moral concern]{.mark}]{.underline}." Pogge's claim that we are
not merely failing to help the global poor but actually harming them,
needs an additional argument, establishing our responsibility for their
fate. Central in this argument is the existence of a global order, in
which all national governments participate, along with international and
supranational institutions like the UN, EU, NATO, WTO, World Bank, and
IMF. [To show why this global world order generates injustices Pogge
presents three disjunctive arguments, addressing the adherents of three
different strands of Western political thought. First, shared
institutions. States are interconnected through a global network of
market trade and diplomacy. This shared institutional global order is
shaped by the better-off, and imposed on the worse-off. We impose a
global institutional order that foreseeably and avoidably reproduces
severe and widespread poverty. This order is unjust if there is a
feasible institutional alternative under which such severe human rights
deprivations would not persist**.**]{.underline} (199-201). [Second,
uncompensated exclusion. The better-off enjoy significant advantages in
appropriating wealth from our planet, such as the use of a single
natural resource base like crude oil]{.underline}. The worse-off are
largely, and without compensation, excluded from the gains of this
appropriation (201-203). [Third violent history. The inequalities in the
social starting positions of the better-off and the worse-off have
emerged from a single historical process that was pervaded by massive,
grievous wrongs, such as a history of conquest and colonization with
oppression and enslavement]{.underline} (203-204). [Pogge concludes that
poverty in developing countries cannot be seen as disconnected from our
affluence. [The existing global order, and the injustices it generates,
implies that we]{.mark} violate a negative duty not to harm the global
poor, that is, [not]{.mark} to [violate]{.mark} their [basic human
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. This negative duty implies that Western
governments should not impose an institutional order under which,
foreseeably and avoidably, individuals lack secure access to some of the
objects of their human rights. Pogge criticizes the foreign policy of
Western societies, and especially their policies that shaped the global
order, for having pushed their self-interest to the extreme. He gives
some examples: the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea (125) and the WTO-regime (15-19), and concludes that: Our new global
economic order is so harsh on the global poor, then, because it is
shaped in negotiations where our representatives ruthlessly exploit
their vastly superior bargaining power and expertise, as well as any
weakness, ignorance, or corruptibility they may find in their
counterpart negotiators, to shape each agreement for our greatest
benefit (20). His complaint against the WTO regime is not that it opens
markets too much, but that it opens our markets not enough and thereby
gains for us the benefits of free trade, while withholding them from the
global poor (19). The idea that we might only have a humanitarian duty
is thus beside the point. We are harming the global poor by imposing an
unjust global order, in which Western societies close their markets by
protectionist policies, massively subsidize the local agriculture, and
introduce anti-dumping measures in many of the sectors where developing
countries are best able to compete, like agriculture, textiles and
clothing. The existing global institutional order is neither natural,
nor God-given, but shaped and upheld by the more powerful governments
and by actors they control such as the EU, NATO, WTO, OECD, World Bank,
and IMF. The current global order produces a stable pattern of
widespread malnutrition and starvation, and there are alternative
regimes possible that would not produce similarly severe deprivations
(176). [It is the negative duty of Western governments to aim for a
global order under which basic human rights are not violated, that is, a
global order in which all individuals are able to meet their basic
social and economic needs. Of course, [national governments]{.mark}
primarily [focus on]{.mark} the [interests]{.mark} of their own
citizens, [but they should not do so at the expense of gross human
rights violations]{.mark} abroad. Indeed, they can improve the
circumstances of the globally worst-off and meet the demands of justice
without becoming badly-off themselves]{.underline}.

According to the Open Society Foundations report, as of April 2015,
[there had been only six convictions for torture since 2007 and no
convictions of military officials, despite **[thousands of complaints of
torture]{.mark}** during the period]{.underline}. [**[The militarization

vast majority of these have not been judicially investigated.14 T[he
State Department Report cites **[unlawful killings, torture, and forced
disappearances]{.mark}** as among the most significant human rights
abuses [**involving** **the military and law
enforcement**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Forced disappearances are
among the most shocking examples of this impunity (see section, "An Open
Wound"). Mrs. Lopez also described [a recent case to us in which
**[state investigative authorities]{.mark}** apparently
[**collaborated** **with** **organized** **crime**]{.mark} to eliminate
the remains of disappeared persons]{.underline}. A man in Guerrero
searching for disappeared relatives, together with other families, found
the body of his brother in a mass clandestine grave at the bottom of a
steep canyon. They immediately went to the authorities to get help and
for permission to exhume the area, but authorities stalled, despite
having a forensic team on site. Returning the next morning to recover
the bodies, they found that the area had been burned overnight. [The
local head of public safety was fired for helping the
families,]{.underline} and the searchers were prohibited from going back
to the site. 4 U.S. interests in arms sales to Mexico Under the

[A person is taken, arrested, or abducted against her or his will, and
then not seen again. Nor do authorities recognize knowing of the
person's whereabouts or confirm that she or he is in custody, though
state agencies may be responsible. **This is a forced
disappearance**]{.underline}. [[The Mexican government has
registered]{.mark} nearly [27,000 disappearances]{.mark} since 2007,
[but]{.mark} evidence points to several times that many, largely because
these figures exclude "**kidnappings**," and because [only a **small
portion of kidnappings are reported**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Many
kidnappings involved state responsibility through]{.mark} support or
[acquiescence]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[Open Society estimates]{.mark}
that [kidnappings]{.mark}]{.underline}---which also include temporary
abductions---[[exceeded 580,000]{.mark} from 2007 through
2014]{.underline}. By any count, [it is a **human
catastrophe**]{.underline}. Why are people forcibly disappeared?
[Historically, [state forces targeted dissidents and activists]{.mark}
for political reasons, [in order to **terrorize
opposition**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The most well-known example is
the]{.mark} forced [disappearance]{.mark} in September 2014 by
police---while the Army watched from a surveillance center---[of 43
student teachers]{.mark} of Ayotzinapa, Guerrero]{.underline}.
[[The]{.mark} Ayotzinapa [school]{.mark}]{.underline}, which we visited,
[[has a long tradition of]{.mark} training teachers from poor
communities]{.underline}, including bilingual education for indigenous
communities, [and of **[militant protest]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
students' family members and human rights organizations have persisted
in their struggle to find the young men, clarify what happened, and
bring those responsible to justice]{.underline}. [[The Mexican
government has denied its responsibility and **shut down** an]{.mark}
effective [investigation]{.mark}]{.underline} by experts assigned by the
Inter-American Human Rights Commission. [There are other motives and
actors in forced disappearances: criminal organizations, often in
collusion with government officials, also abduct people for ransom,
forced labor, and human trafficking for the sex trade.]{.underline}
[Family members of disappeared persons we spoke with represented broad
classes of people]{.underline}: middle-class devout Christian women,
people from poor indigenous communities, urban doctors and other
professionals, and people who had recently moved to a new state. Some
had no idea why their loved ones had been targeted. [But [a universal
aspec]{.mark}t of the stories of those we met was [the **absolute
refusal** of state officials to help them]{.mark} find their children,
husbands, wives, or siblings, reflecting [not only a lack of resources,
but a lack of will]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[[Police are in **cahoots with
organized crime**]{.mark} and won't do anything]{.underline}," said
Margarita Lopez. "In terms of its purpose to care for, to guard, to
protect people's human rights," Scalabrinian Sister Leticia Gutiérrez
told us, "[the state's policy is to do nothing, to not recognize
anything happening. That is its policy]{.underline}." [It is probable
that [most disappeared persons **have been
murdered**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which means there are many unmarked
graves.]{.underline} [[At least 118 mass graves had been
discovered]{.mark} as of November 2015]{.underline},32 but more
continued to be found. Because state agencies have refused to
investigate where the remains of people disappeared and killed are
located\--much less bring to justice those responsible---families and
communities increasingly have begun their own investigations and
uncovered a growing number of clandestine graves, moving "from
indignation to action," in the words of one family member. In Guerrero
alone, at least 60 such mass graves have been identified.33 [In some
cases, [the **state itself** has created mass graves of disappeared
persons]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Cuernavaca, we met with Tranquilina
Hernández Lagunas, whose daughter was disappeared. She sought to recover
her remains in a mass grave created by the state prosecutor's office,
but her daughter's body was not among those recovered at the site. Juan
Carlos Trujillo, four of whose brothers have been disappeared, told our
delegation how his group had gone to churches to tell their story and
seek support. After passing a collection jar, they would find a slip of
paper someone had deposited that described in detail where a grave could
be found. Using such outreach, the group located more mass graves than
the government itself, in a shorter period. [Yet identification of
remains has been paralyzed by the state's failure to establish a DNA
database.]{.underline}

**[The militarization of Mexican police has been accompanied by a
dramatic rise in reports of human rights violations by federal and state
security forces]{.underline}**, and [the vast majority of these have not
been judicially investigated]{.underline}.14 The **[State Department
Report cites unlawful killings, torture, and forced disappearances as
among the most significant human rights abuses involving the military
and law enforcement.]{.underline}** Forced disappearances are among the
most shocking examples of this impunity (see section, "An Open Wound").
Mrs. Lopez also described a recent case to us in which state
investigative authorities apparently collaborated with organized crime
to eliminate the remains of disappeared persons. A man in Guerrero
searching for disappeared relatives, together with other families, found
the body of his brother in a mass clandestine grave at the bottom of a
steep canyon. They immediately went to the authorities to get help and
for permission to exhume the area, but authorities stalled, despite
having a forensic team on site. Returning the next morning to recover
the bodies, they found that the area had been burned overnight. The
local head of public safety was fired for helping the families, and the
searchers were prohibited from going back to the site. 4

#### US arms sales to Mexico endorse torture

[**[Torture is widely practiced in Mexico to obtain confessions and
extract information]{.mark}**. It is most frequently applied in the
period between when victims are detained, often arbitrarily, and when
they are handed over to civilian prosecutors]{.underline}---a period in
which they are often held incommunicado at military bases or illegal
detention sites. According to a survey of [more than 64,000 people
incarcerated in 338 Mexican prisons located throughout the
country]{.underline} in 2016, performed by Mexico's national statistics
office (INEGI), [[64 percent of the prison population reported having
suffered some type of physical violence at the time of their arrest: 19
percent reported receiving electrical shocks; 36 percent being choked,
held underwater, or smothered; and 59 percent being hit or kicked. In
addition, 28 percent reported that they were threatened that their
family would be harmed]{.underline}.]{.mark} Between December 2012 and
January 2018[, the Attorney General's Office opened more than 9,000
investigations into torture. However, **[torturers are rarely brought to
justice.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Investigations suffer from serious
shortcomings. In March, [the Mexican Office of the UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights published an investigation that stated it had found
"solid grounds to conclude" that [at least 34 detainees had been
tortured during the investigation of the 2014 disappearance of 43
students from Ayotzinapa]{.mark}]{.underline}. In May, a federal judge
established that prosecutors had not adequately investigated evidence of
torture of detainees in the Ayotzinapa case. [At least 10 government
agencies filed appeals against the ruling, which, at time of writing,
remained pending.]{.underline}

#### Police routinely hurt citizens with US arms

06/26/19, EM)

Enforced Disappearances Since 2006, [[enforced disappearances by
security forces have been a widespread problem]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Criminal organizations have also been responsible for many
disappearances. In October 2018, the interior minister stated that the
whereabouts of more than 37,400 people who had gone missing since 2006
remain unknown. According to the CNDH, more than 3,900 bodies have been
found in over 1,300 clandestine graves since 2007. **[[Prosecutors and
police routinely neglect to take basic investigative steps to identify
those responsible for enforced disappearances, often telling the missing
people's families to investigate on their own]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Since 2013, the Attorney General's Office has had a specialized office
to investigate and prosecute disappearances. As of August 2018, it had
opened 1,255 investigations but only pressed charges in 11 cases. It did
not report any convictions. In November 2017, Congress passed a law on
disappearances that established a single nationwide definition for the
crime and mandated the creation of entities to facilitate the
investigation and prosecution of disappearances. These include the
National Search Commission (CNB) that was created in March 2018 to
coordinate search efforts in the field, and the National Search System
(SNB), established in October 2018 to coordinate state institutions
involved in the search for the disappeared. However, at time of writing
these entities were not yet fully operational. In July 2018, the Citizen
Council of the National Search System, an advisory body created by the
disappearances law, reported that the CNB was not receiving the
resources it needs to fulfill its mandate. The council also criticized
the lack of coordination between institutions, and expressed its concern
that most states lag behind in implementing the law. Only 13 out of 32
states had created a specialized prosecutor's office and only nine out
of 32 states had local search commissions or offices, even though the
law mandated the creation of those entities by February and April 2018,
respectively. Victims' families have repeatedly denounced serious
shortcomings regarding the identification and storage of bodies. In
September, [media reported that in Jalisco state, [neighbors complained
about smells of decaying bodies and leaks of blood after the state
prosecutor's office parked a refrigeration trailer packed with
unidentified bodies in their neighborhood because the morgue was full.
The former director of forensic services stated that authorities had
used refrigeration trailers for at least two years to store more than
250 bodies. The human rights prosecutor asserted that authorities had
taken proper information and samples to enable identification of only 60
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### US arms sales to Mexico leads to unlawful killings of civilians by Mexican security forces

**Human Rights Watch**, an international non-governmental organization
that conducts research and advocacy on human rights, 20**16** (Human
Rights Watch, 2019, World Report 2019, Mexico Events of 2018,
<https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/mexico#899ef4>,
06/26/19, EM)

Extrajudicial Killings **[[Unlawful killings of civilians by Mexican
security forces "take place at an alarmingly high
rate]{.underline}]{.mark}**" amid an atmosphere of "systematic and
endemic impunity," according to the United Nations special rapporteur on
extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions in 2014. However, there
is no reliable information about the number of extrajudicial
executions[. [The vast majority of homicides are never prosecuted.
Government authorities only register the number of homicides and not the
circumstances in which these took place]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
The Defense Department stopped registering the numbers of civilians it
killed as of 2014. Attacks on Journalists [[Journalists,]{.mark}
particularly those who report on crime or criticize officials, [often
face harassment and attack by both government authorities and criminal
groups.]{.mark}]{.underline} Many journalists are driven to
self-censorship as a result. A 2017 study by researchers from the
University of Miami and the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City
showed that almost 70 percent of journalists said they had engaged in
self-censorship out of fear for their personal safety. Between January
2000 and August 2018, [[110 journalists were killed and 25
disappeared]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to the Attorney General's
Office. The CNDH put that number even higher: it reported [148
journalists killed since 2000 and 21 disappeared since
2005]{.underline}. Media reports indicated that eight journalists were
killed between January and September 2018. In 2012, the federal
government established the National Protection Mechanism to issue and
coordinate the implementation of protective measures for journalists and
human rights defenders under threat. Between October 2012 and July 2018,
418 journalists requested and 357 were authorized to receive protection
measures. However, protection has been slow to arrive and, in some
cases, has been insufficient. In August 2018, the CNDH and the Mexican
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed their
concern about the lack of resources for the mechanism. [[Authorities
routinely fail to investigate crimes against journalists
adequately,]{.mark} often preemptively ruling out their profession as a
motive]{.underline}. The CNDH reported in 2016 that [90 percent of
crimes against journalists in Mexico since 2000 have gone unpunished,
including 82 percent of killings and 100 percent of
disappearances.]{.underline} Since its creation in July 2010, the
federal Special Prosecutor's Office opened more than 1,000
investigations into crimes against journalists. As of August 2018, it
brought charges in 152 cases and obtained only seven convictions, of
which just one was for homicide.

#### Women's rights in Mexico are not upheld

Women's and Girls' Rights [[Mexican laws do not adequately protect women
and girls against domestic and sexual violence]{.mark}. Some provisions,
including those that make the severity of punishments for some sexual
offenses contingent upon the "chastity" of the victim, contradict
international standards]{.underline}. Eighteen of Mexico's 32 states
establish in their constitutions that there is a right to life from the
moment of conception. Although the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that all
states must provide emergency contraception and access to abortion for
rape victims, **[[many women and girls face serious barriers accessing
abortions after sexual violence, including official
intimidation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to a study by the Group
for Information about Elective Reproduction (GIRE), between 2007 and
2016, Mexico convicted 98 women for abortions. In July, the UN Committee
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women urged the state to
take measures to combat the discrimination of women---including in the
workplace---and to prevent gender-based violence and the trafficking of
women and girls.

#### The U.S. continues to sell small arms to Mexico, which falls into the hands of militias such as the Guerro police who ignore the Mexican government and abuse human rights.

Mary Ann **McGivern '18**, reporter for the National Catholic Reporter,
February 28, 2018

\[McGivern, Mary Ann. "Mexico Disappearances Highlight Consequences of
Small Arms Exports." National Catholic Reporter, 28 Feb. 2019,
www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/ncr-today/mexico-disappearances-highlight-consequences-small-arms-exports.\]

You may remember the kidnapping and presumed murder of 43 Mexican
students in 2014 in Guerrero, Mexico. **[Local police who attacked the
students and took them into custody were carrying]{.underline} German
Heckler & Koch weapons and [U.S. Colt AR-6530 rifles]{.underline}**. The
local police were also carrying Italian Berettas, but it is not known if
they were imported legally from the U.S. or elsewhere or if they were
smuggled in. While the investigation is ongoing, **[evidence indicates
that police used these small arms to murder the 43 Mexican
students]{.underline}**. (Gun smuggling is another story. When my
community, Loretto, leads border investigation groups, we carry clothes,
shoes and backpacks across the border to aid deportees. Our packages are
virtually never checked. Guns cross the border just as easily.) The
Mexican army is the only authorized arms dealer in Mexico. The army
controls foreign imports, local manufacture, sales and exports. Mexico
has strict laws regulating civilian gun ownership. Only one retail
store, located in Mexico City, is permitted to sell to civilians. The
Mexican army provides local police with the arms deemed necessary. The
Colts were exported from the U.S by Colt, a U.S. firm, under a U.S.
export license. They went to the Mexican army, which provided them to
the Guerrero police. Those police also obtained the Heckler & Koch and
Beretta weapons from the army, through a license. But German law
prohibits export of German weapons to states that violate human rights.
**[The Guerrero police have a bad human rights record and they
fall]{.underline}** with**[in]{.underline}** **[the category of human
rights violators]{.underline}** Germany refuses to sell guns to. Since
2010, Germany does not license gun sales to Mexico. So here\'s the
astonishing action Germany took. German federal commissioner Christoph
Strässer apologized on behalf of Germany to the families of the 43
missing students over the apparent use of German weapons. Moreover,
Germany criminally prosecuted Heckler & Koch officials for the exports
to Mexico. Germany has filed charges against another gun company, Sig
Sauer, which shipped weapons from its German manufacturing site to Sig
Sauer in the United States, which then illegally re-exported them to
Colombia. **[Laws denying small arms to human rights abusers --- and
state apologies when those arms transfers do happen --- that\'s
diplomacy in action. The United States and Italy had no
comment.]{.underline}** However, a letter is circulating in Congress to
limit arms exports to Mexico. While almost every House Democrat has
signed on to legislation requiring stronger background checks for gun
purchases in the U.S., controls on weapons exports are few and far
between and Congress has been reluctant to call for them. **[Small arms
exports are a huge and troubling issue, and it\'s difficult to find ways
to resist these gun transfers]{.underline}**. I learned about gun
traffic with Mexico from a workshop led by John Lindsay-Poland at the
School of the Americas Watch protest in Nogales, Arizona. It\'s taken me
a couple of months to chew on the information and get enough of an
understanding to write about it. But now I\'ve learned that this
congressional letter is circulating. We can ask our representatives to
sign this letter.

## \*\*\*Plan & Solvency\*\*\*

### 1AC Plan

#### The United States federal government should substantially reduce foreign military sales and direct commercial sales of arms from the United States to Mexico.

### 1AC Solvency

#### Weapons sales to the Mexican state are actually the biggest internal link to violence 

**Epstein '19** (Louis, Brown University, Mexican Security Forces Commit
War Crimes: Stop Arming Them, Foreign Policy in Focus, 1/29/2019,

Americans might think of Acapulco as a tropical idyll but it's
increasingly something different: a homicide capital. [[U.S. weapons,
sold to Mexican law enforcement authorities]{.mark} ostensibly to help
combat criminals, [are]{.mark} instead [fueling violence, torture,
disappearances, and massacres]{.mark}.]{.underline} A new investigation
by the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights
(CMDPDH), a UN-funded human rights watchdog, has found that [American
guns sold to the Mexican army are disappearing from armories and being
reported lost or stolen]{.underline}. I spent four months in Mexico
working with the commission's investigative team, and we concluded that
as many as [20 percent of the guns sold in some Mexican
states]{.underline}---more than 20,000 over the past decade---[have gone
missing.]{.underline} Mexican authorities have trouble keeping track of
the guns they buy. No fewer than 342 disappeared from Acapulco's police
armory before the September raids. It's impossible to know what these
guns have since been used for, but the investigation found that more
than 1,400 unmarked graves have been unearthed across Mexico since 2007.
These pits held the remains of almost 2,000 victims, some in mass graves
with more 80 bodies. More graves are found every month, and the total
number of victims of this violence is likely much higher. [[The Mexican
military is the only legal importer and vendor of weapons in the
country]{.underline}. [It buys guns from American companies and then
distributes them to police forces and federal
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} [Because gun ownership in
Mexico is tightly controlled, most of the guns it resells go to state
and local police, who are notoriously corrupt and often collude with or
are infiltrated by drug gangs]{.underline}. Either by theft or graft,
the 20 percent of weapons that are "lost or stolen" tend to wind up in
the hands of criminals. In effect, then, **[[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is fueling the violence in Mexico by providing the
guns]{.mark} being used by both criminals and the corrupt police who are
failing to stop them]{.underline}**. And the Trump administration, eager
to sell even more arms, is seeking to weaken the few safeguards that are
in place.

#### Studies show we solve.

[The Trump administration has proposed what could be a decisive
weakening of the already ineffective system by which the United States
controls small-arms sales to repressive security forces by shifting
responsibility for vetting these sales from the State Department to the
Commerce Department]{.underline}. [That would move the process from a
department with at least a formal commitment to human rights to one
whose priority is supporting American businesses.]{.underline} The
administration also wants to begin allowing American gun makers to sell
semi-automatic weapons without first getting a State Department license.
And the administration proposes to reduce oversight of such sales by
Congress. Although Congress is now notified of commercial weapons sales
worth over \$1 million under the Arms Export Control Act, Trump's
proposed changes would stop those notifications. Senators Ben Cardin
(D-MD), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) have criticized
the proposed changes, but the National Rifle Association and gun
manufacturers have voiced their support for them. (The Obama
administration first proposed these changes, but reversed course after
several high-profile mass shootings.) In June, twelve members of
[[Congress asked the secretaries of state and defense for "a full and
public evaluation" of U.S. security aid and arms sales to
Mexico]{.mark}, which they said has contributed to "a dramatic increase
in human rights violations]{.underline}." But without widespread concern
from the public and the press about the situation in Mexico, [these
policy changes and the raging violence haven't been high priorities.
**[Research has shown that limiting access to guns may reduce violence
in Mexico]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [A study from]{.underline} the
[U]{.underline}niversity of
[Mass]{.underline}achusetts-[Amherst]{.underline} [found that homicides
rose 60 percent in]{.underline} Mexican [municipalities with access to
American assault weapons]{.underline} compared to those without it.
[[Cutting off access to a source of guns makes it more difficult for
criminal groups to commit violent crimes]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### A2 alt cause -- gun stores

#### Federal sales to Mexico's government are the biggest link -- gun stores are overblown

William La **Jeunesse '15**, November 21, 2015. \| Fox News, "America\'s
Third War: Is the U.S. Arming Mexican Cartels?"
https://www.foxnews.com/us/americas-third-war-is-the-u-s-arming-mexican-cartels

Even though these facts were well-known by the
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administration, including Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder, it
[[blamed]{.mark} much of the [violence in Mexico on]{.mark} U.S. [gun
stores]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"More than 90 percent of the guns
recovered in Mexico come from the United States, many from gun shops
that line our border,\" President Obama said in February 2009. [[That
was contested, but few listened]{.mark} to gun store owners and former
vets like Lynn Kartchner, owner of Allsafe Security, a gun shop in
Douglas, Ariz. \"We in [the gun industry knew from Day One the
allegations]{.mark} that the preponderance of sales came from gun stores
like this one was totally [not true]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Kartchner
said. [**[In fact]{.mark}**, many of **[these weapons are getting to
Mexico via the U.S. government]{.mark}**. [Tens of thousands]{.mark} of
firearms and explosives [are sold legally through the U.S. State
Department to the Mexican government]{.mark}. These [weapons are then
funneled to]{.mark} the [traffickers and cartels]{.mark} by corrupt
officials within the Mexico Ministry of Defense and local and state
police departments]{.underline}. According to State Department
documents, in 2009 Mexico bought nearly \$177 million worth of
American-made weapons, exceeding sales to Iraq and Afghanistan. That
number includes \$20 million in semi- and fully automatic weapons.
\"[Most of the M16s were sold legally to the Mexican government and
disappeared]{.underline},\" Kartchner added. State Department cables
obtained by WikiLeaks confirm that fear. One cable from November 2009
reads, \"U.S. law enforcement has fair reason to worry a number of
weapons simply disappear\... \" Another from June 2009 says, \"Rogue
elements of the Guatemalan military are selling weapons to narcos.\"
"These are weapons that have been stockpiled either through U.S. aid
programs or currently being shipped there under the guise of military
support,\" said a confidential informant in Arizona who has worked for
federal agencies such as the FBI, ATF and DEA. \"The governments and
military in those countries realize that the economy is such that they
are far better off to push these weapons north and sell them than they
are to keep them in their own arsenals and reserves,\" he said. Evidence
of that is also contained in the Small Arms Survey. The table shows U.S.
government sales of rifles, machine guns and handguns in the hundreds of
thousands over a five-year period number. And a GAO report from last
year details both foreign military and direct commercial sales of arms
from 2005 to 2009. [After looking at [a warehouse full of high-powered
weapons]{.mark}, allegedly stolen by a corrupt Mexican federal police
officer, the informant said it was obvious to him that such weapons [did
not come from]{.mark} the \"[mom and pop\" gun stores]{.mark} identified
by the administration]{.underline}.

charge, it seems, as Beith notes, that "\[d\]rugs are the only way to
get ahead" (87). In a generalized consumerist culture that glorifi es
material success, the illegal drug trade is a "caricatured celebration
of consumerism and wealth" (Campbell, 9). Citizens "treat minor
cross-border smuggling of food, clothing, medicine, and other items as a
regular part of life rather than a moral crime" (Campbell, 31), and a
"culture of illegality . . . seems to have won out over any other
options" (Beith, 88). So, beyond a potential parallel state run by DTOs,
Bunker sees a challenge to traditional values, an antivalue system.
Similarly, Campbell notes the emergence of a powerful and complex social
identity, replete with narcomansiones, narcoarte, narcointeligencia,
narcoabogados, and narcocorridos, and invjolving cultlike religions and
blood and ritual sacrifi ce. Impunity reigns as a key element of this
cultural mix.

#### Police capture and kill citizens

**Valencia, reporter for Newsweek, 18** (Robert, 10-26-19, Newsweek
Global, "Government Sponsored Murder.", accessed 6-30-19, RR)

ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2014, [[police in]{.mark} the Mexican town of [Iguala
intercepted]{.mark} a group of [students]{.mark} from the Ayotzinapa
Rural Teachers\' College,]{.underline} located in the Guerrero state, a
region rife with drug-related violence. The students---also called
normalistas---had been stopped for hijacking two buses to travel to
Mexico City, where they intended to join the annual march that
commemorates the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre, a national scandal in which
hundreds of students and civilians were killed by the military. [In the
subsequent clash, [six students]{.mark}, all in their 20s, [were killed
and]{.mark} another [25 wounded]{.mark}. [Forty-three simply
vanished]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [government]{.mark}\'s official
investigation [found]{.mark} that [authorities]{.mark} [turned]{.mark}
the [normalistas]{.mark} over [to]{.mark} the Guerreros Unidos [drug
cartel]{.mark}, [which killed and]{.mark} then [burned the]{.mark}
missing [students]{.mark} in a trash pit in Cocula. [Mexicans rejected
that]{.mark} version, and thousands demonstrated, [shouting]{.mark},
\"They took them from us alive, want them back alive\" and \"Fue el
estado! \[[It was the state]{.mark}!\].\"]{.underline} In March the
office of the U.N. high commissioner for human rights found that the
so-called Ayotzinapa investigation was inadequate and \"affected by
cover-ups.\" For journalist Anabel Hernández, it was long-sought
vindication. Hernández has been investigating collusion between
government officials and drug cartels, as well as the illicit drug trade
and abuse of power, for Mexico\'s biggest publications for over two
decades. Death threats from the cartels forced her and her family to
leave the country---they now live in San Francisco---but she has
continued to investigate Ayotzinapa. Using video from surveillance
footage, medical reports and secret government documents, she pieced
together her theory in A Massacre in Mexico: The True Story Behind the
Missing Forty-Three Students, first published in Spanish in 2016.
Newsweek spoke with the author just before the book\'s English-language
release. What\'s changed since the Spanish-language version was
published? The [[findings]{.mark} have been [confirmed by the
U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}, a federal judge and a
court in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. The [majority of the [people
apprehended by the]{.mark} [Mexican government for]{.mark} the [attacks
on]{.mark} the [students]{.mark} had [been brutally tortured and forced
to]{.mark} [confess]{.mark} to a crime they didn\'t commit.]{.underline}
One of the tortured individuals included Felipe Rodríguez Salgado (aka
\"El Cepillo,\" or \"the Brush\"), who the government accused of burning
the students in the alleged trash pit. There are five people who have
been exonerated, and a federal judge began to issue release orders for
the others \[in September\]. Who is responsible for the attacks?
[[Those]{.mark} [who committed the]{.mark} [crimes include]{.mark} the
[mayor who ordered the police to intercept the]{.mark} hijacked
[buses]{.mark}, the service people from the 27th Infantry battalion,
[members of the federal police]{.mark} assigned to the Iguala
headquarters, members of [the office of the attorney general and state
police and municipal]{.mark} [authorities]{.mark}. We\'re talking about
nearly 60 public officials.]{.underline} The other culprits are those
who covered the crimes up---the officials who refused to incarcerate and
prosecute. The administration of \[outgoing President Enrique\] Peña
Nieto; the defense secretary, Salvador Cienfuegos; the then-attorney
general, Jesús Murillo Karam; and the then---interior minister, Miguel
Ángel Osorio Chong. [Four years later, have there been advances in
bringing these officials to justice? No. It is [proved that]{.mark} at
least [nine]{.mark} [police officers fired weapons]{.mark} that night
[but no]{.mark} participating service person, federal and state police
[officer]{.mark} or member of the office of the attorney general [has
been detained]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 43 students are among the many
thousands who have gone missing in Mexico, correct? [In the last 12
years, [36,000 people]{.mark} have [disappeared amid the
country\'s]{.mark} so-called [war on drugs]{.mark}.]{.underline} When
the Felipe Calderón administration ended in 2012, The New York Times and
[I had access to a database that contained 25,000 missing people at the
time. But the Calderón administration wanted to delete the list so
Mexicans wouldn\'t find out how many people disappeared and under what
circumstances]{.underline}. This is the reason why the Ayotzinapa case
is so important: There is a pattern here. [Most of these [disappearances
occurred with]{.mark} the presence of [authorities]{.mark} during the
crime.]{.underline} From the Calderón government to the outgoing Peña
Nieto administration, it is believed that [disappearances are carried
out by organized crime such as drug cartels, kidnappers or human
traffickers.]{.underline} [The [Mexican]{.mark} [government]{.mark} has
[never recognized]{.mark} that [state institutions are]{.mark} either
the main [perpetrators]{.mark} or accomplices of these crimes. It is
proved that the [Mexican army has]{.mark} actively [participated
in]{.mark} the [country\'s]{.mark} most terrible
[massacries]{.mark}---including Tlatelolco in 1968 and El Charco in
1998]{.underline}. In many cases, these [[crimes go
unpunished]{.underline}]{.mark}; there is [no single military member
behind bars.]{.underline} President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador
pledged to reopen the investigations when he assumes office. Are you
hopeful? I spoke with Alejandro Encinas, the undersecretary of human
rights, starting December 1. He confirmed that the new administration
will submit the Mexican army, public officials, soldiers and captains to
a rigorous interrogation, in hopes of finding the corpses. López Obrador
may have good intentions, but the consequences of a government holding
an army as powerful as Mexico\'s accountable will be unthinkable. And
yet it is indispensable to do so. [The [army has never been]{.mark} more
[powerful]{.mark}, with a larger arsenal and improved training. But
[instead of using these to combat drug cartels, they use them against
the population]{.mark}. We can\'t talk about a democratic government as
long as there is an institution that kills citizens with
impunity]{.underline}. [The army and marines have no training in human
rights and have been permeated by drug cartels. It\'s also worth noting
that the [military is financed, trained and well equipped by the
U.S.]{.mark} through the 2008 Mérida Initiative, a security cooperation
agreement that seeks to combat money laundering and illicit drug
trade]{.underline}. Do you still fear for your life? We can\'t return to
Mexico to live. I went back in August 2016 for the investigation and to
publish my book. At that time, I was told that I was being followed and
was forced to leave again. Notwithstanding, I\'m returning once or twice
every month to continue my research. Criminals inside and outside of the
government managed to get me out of my homeland, but they won\'t silence
me.

Equally important to evaluating human rights claims is an analysis of
the causes for decreases in state violations. Human rights conditions on
U.S. assistance and other U.S. actions may have played a part in the
decline in "false positive" killings, but [t[he U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates acted after other actors, both Colombian and
international, documented and [denounced the pattern of
killings]{.mark}. When the United States did speak, [its message was
mixed with continued military support]{.mark}.]{.underline}

A closer reading of events strongly suggests that other actors played a
more important role than the U.S. government in the initial steep
decline in killings. First, many family members of those killed decided
to publicly denounce the killing of their children, husbands, and other
family members. Beyond the fact of killing, [many times it was [the lie
that the military told]{.mark} about their loved ones---that they had
been guerrillas---that especially [made families indignant, similar to
the fury generated by lies and disrespect for the dead in cases of
police killings of black men in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
the forty-three students from]{.mark} Ayotzinapa, [Mexico]{.mark},
killed in September 2014.]{.underline}48 Army participants in civilian
killings in Colombia testified that the practice there targeted
individuals who were marginalized, and whom the army believed no one
would miss.49 In this respect, the military miscalculated the political
cost of these killings.

U.S. Embassy staff assured us that police who are shown to have
committed grave human rights abuses are barred from receiving U.S.
training. But the restriction apparently does not apply to police
receiving U.S.-exported weapons. **[[An increasing amount of arms sales
to Mexico are made directly by the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates

[S]{.mark}ales, even though those producers still profit from the

rifles and other firearms sold at retail stores and gun shows in the
United States and smuggled into Mexico. Paulina Arriaga, executive
director of Desarma Mexico (desarmamexico.org), told us that one can't
talk about arms in Mexico without talking about the United States. For
example, the end of the assault weapons ban in 2004 provoked a spike in
the presence of such weapons in Mexico.19 Seventy percent of firearms
seized in criminal investigations in Mexico come from the U.S.,
according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. In fact,
Arriaga says the U.S. is "without a doubt the primary provider of legal
and illegal arms in Mexico." Those weapons contributed to some 65
percent of the nearly 15 million "common crimes" committed in Mexico
from 2011 to 2013, and roughly 56 percent of the 57,000 homicides
committed since 2013. Of the U.S.-sourced guns seized by authorities at
crime scenes in Mexico, up to a half of them were imported into the
United States from other nations, according to a Violence Policy Center
report. If the United States restricted imports of assault weapons, it
could reduce the flow of such weapons to Mexico, even without a full
U.S. legislative ban on the sale of assault weapons.20

Under the framework of the Merida Initiative, [the U.S. government has
funneled billions]{.underline} of dollars [into Mexico]{.underline} with
the stated intent "to fight organized crime and associated violence
while furthering respect for human rights and the rule of law." Launched
in 2007, the initiative is formally focused on (1) [disrupting organized
criminal groups]{.underline}, (2[) institutionalizing the rule of
law]{.underline}, (3) **[creating a]{.underline}** 21st-century
**[border, and]{.underline}** (4) [building strong and resilient
communities]{.underline} in Mexico. According to a January 2016 report
by the Congressional Research Service, "Newer areas of focus have
involved bolstering security along Mexico's southern border and
addressing the production and trafficking of heroin in Mexico."15 Most
of the \$2.1 billion of military and police assistance to Mexico since
2008 has been counter-drug equipment and training for Mexican police
agencies, including \$590 million worth of aircraft. In addition to U.S.
grant assistance to Mexico, most of which is channeled to U.S.
companies, the United States has also approved the transfer through
sales of billions of dollars' worth of other arms to the Mexican
government. According to The Washington Post, **[[the value of weapons
and military equipment sold was \$3.5 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}**
from 2012 to 2015 **[[and included firearms, armored vehicles,
helicopters, and other military aircraft]{.underline}]{.mark}**.16
"**[We didn't sell them just the helicopters," [a former Pentagon

have."]{.mark}]{.underline}**17 Whatever the pretext or mode of
delivery, the evidence is strong that such U.S. military transfers
contribute significantly to violence, instability, and the denial of
human rights. Because of the depth of corruption in the Mexican
government, police and armed forces blur the lines between official
groups and criminals, and legal arms sales frequently end up arming
criminal gangs and criminal conduct directly. Moreover, the Mexican
police and military have a long history of repression against mostly
peaceful social movements.

[[Mexico has been on a buying spree for U.S. military equipment,
especially helicopters and]{.mark} armored [vehicles, with
purchases]{.mark} amounting to [more than a billion dollars]{.mark} in
the last 12 months]{.underline}. U.S. Northern Commmand chief Admiral
William Gortney said the combined deals represent \"a **100-fold
increase** from prior years.\" For a military supposedly proud of its
independence from the United States, it is a dependent client. On
Tuesday, March 17, the State Department approved the sale of three
Blackhawk helicopters to the Mexican military for \$110 million, to
support Mexican troops engaged in counter-drug operations. The deal
comes on the heels of a larger agreement last April for Mexico to buy 18
Blackhawks for \$680 million. The helicopters are produced by Sikorsky,
based in Connecticut (also supplier to Colombia and other countries),
and General Electric, in Lynn, MA. The deals include training and the
construction of a facility. The United States will also reportedly
supply six M134 7.62mm machine guns for the helicopters, which fire up
to 6,000 rounds a minute. Last May, Washington approved a sale of more
than 3,000 Humvees for the Mexican military, at a cost of \$556 million,
in order to expand \"existing army architecture to combat drug
trafficking organizations\" and enhance \"interoperability between
Mexico and the U.S.\" The Humvees will be built by AM General in
Mishawaka, Indiana. A later report said that in December the Pentagon
approved sale of 2,200 of the Humvee vehicles, for just \$245 million.
Mexico City police purchased five helicopters from Texas-based Bell last
month, for another \$26.4 million. The helicopters will be assigned to
the Condores, a group of special police. Two weeks later, the Mexican
Air Force sealed a deal for 15 Bell helicopters, valued for at least
\$37 million, to be based at an airbase in Jalisco state. [In January,
[the Pentagon said that the Mexican **Navy**, too, is buying]{.mark}
Blackhawks -- five of them, for \$56 million.]{.underline} Last
September, the Navy also announced the purchase of four King Air 350ER
aircraft, to be used for \"maritime surveillance of strategic
installations, light transport, and medical evacuation.\" The aircraft
are built by Beechcraft Corporation, a subsidiary of Textron Aviation,
which sold another four aircraft to the Mexican Navy in 2013. [All told,
[these agreements represent at least \$1.15 billion in arms sales to the
Mexican military or police]{.mark} in the last year, mostly [facilitated
by the Pentagon through the]{.mark} Foreign Military Sales
([FMS]{.mark}) [program. FMS sales]{.mark} frequently [come at a
discount, and are not subject to human rights restrictions]{.mark}, such
as the Leahy Law.]{.underline} These sales do not include guns and
ammunition. [In 2014, [the U.S. legally transferred more than 28,000
firearms to Mexico, most of them]{.mark} military [rifles, at a value of
\$21.6 million]{.mark}]{.underline}. The year saw the most firearms
sales in dollars of the 15 years that the U.S. Census Bureau has kept

#### Gun violence makes their impact inevitable -- undermines the foundation of economic growth at the community level

Nicole **Weissman et al. '16**. Research: Yasemin Irvin-Erickson, Bing
Bai, Annie Gurvis, and Edward Mohr November 3, 2016. "Is Gun Violence
Stunting Business Growth?"
https://www.urban.org/features/gun-violence-stunting-business-growth

[[Gun violence imposes heavy social, psychological, and financial
burdens on]{.mark} both individuals and **[society at
large]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some of these burdens are known---we learn
of the emotional cost from news stories and moving personal accounts,
and we have previously calculated the health care costs of treating
gunshot injuries. But we know comparatively little about the
relationship between gun violence and local economic health. In the
communities and neighborhoods most affected by gun violence, is the
presence of guns---absent other factors---impeding business growth? [A
recent [longitudinal study shows]{.mark} that neighborhood-level
economic activity affects the conditions that make crime more likely and
that violent crime can decline in the same year that economic activity
increases. Earlier studies by Bowes and Greenbaum and Tita show that
[crime and fear]{.mark} of crime [adversely affect the economic health
of communities, cutting into business revenues and limiting]{.mark}
business [activity]{.mark}]{.underline}. New Urban research led by
Yasemin Irvin-Erickson builds on these findings by exploring the
association between gun violence and economic health of neighborhoods in
six cities: Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland,
California; Rochester, New York; San Francisco, California; and
Washington, DC. This study integrates innovative data from several
sources, including the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS)
database, gunshot detection technology, and credit bureau data, to
develop concrete numbers describing the association between gun violence
and local economic health. An interim report presents findings from
Oakland, Washington, DC, and Minneapolis and explores the association
between gun violence and business trends by census tract, using fixed
effects panel models and analysis of observational data with statistical
matching. City profiles Employment Growth versus Homicide Rate in Three
Cities Minneapolis Minneapolis, where gun homicides stayed roughly level
from 2010 to 2012 and mirrored the national rate, provides a valuable
comparison point for other cities. Although gun violence levels remained
steady during this period, NETS data show the city employment increased,
from 208,000 to 224,000 in retail and service businesses and from
347,000 to 352,000 across all categories.1 Growth in Minneapolis
outpaced that of Oakland, where gun homicides increased over the same
period, but fell short of Washington, DC, where gun homicides decreased.
Washington, DC Gun homicides in Washington, DC, decreased from 2010 to
2012, with 2012 marking the first time in three years the city had a gun
homicide rate lower than the national average. NETS data from 2011 to
2012 show the number of employees increased from 484,000 to 497,000 in
retail and service businesses and from 850,000 to 1 million across all
categories. Oakland Gun homicides increased in Oakland from 2010 to
2012, reaching roughly 28 homicides annually per 100,000 people (more
than 2.5 times the national rate for 2012). NETS data from 2011 to 2012
show the number of employees in Oakland fell from 125,000 to 115,000 in
retail and service businesses and from 210,000 to 205,000 across all
categories. The map below overlays Oakland's census tract neighborhoods
with gun homicide data from 2011 and employment growth data from 2011 to
2012. Tracts highlighted in magenta experienced the most gun homicides.
The tabs alternate between employment growth in retail and service
businesses and growth across all business categories. The two pockets of
the city with the most gun homicides were also areas of low employment
growth, despite being surrounded by areas of relatively moderate growth.
Findings from regression analyses Preliminary findings yield data that
demonstrate an intuitive yet striking relationship between gun homicides
and economic activity at the neighborhood level, controlling for both
the year and census tract effects. In Oakland, each additional homicide
in a census tract was significantly associated with five fewer job
opportunities among contracting businesses (businesses losing employees)
the next year. In Minneapolis, one less homicide in a census tract was
significantly associated with the creation of 80 jobs and an additional
\$9.4 million in sales across all businesses the following year. A
subset analysis of census tracts across all three cities that
experienced a surge in homicides in 2011, controlling for existing
levels of violence, found that these surges were significantly
associated with an increase in contracting businesses. In Washington,
DC, each additional homicide in a census tract in a given year was
significantly associated with two fewer retail and service businesses
the next year. For census tracts with available gunshot detection
technology data, every 10 fewer incidents of gunfire in a census tract
were significantly related to one new business opening, the creation of
20 jobs in new businesses, \$1.3 million more in sales at new
businesses, and one fewer business closure. Neighborhood-level data and
their implications Data from Minneapolis show that stable levels of gun
violence can coincide with some business growth, but growth may be lower
than in cities where levels of gun violence are in decline. And although
employment numbers may increase at the city level, neighborhood-level
data reveal that an increase in gun violence is accompanied by decreases
in number of establishments, sales, and employment in local businesses.
Ongoing analysis shows that these data can provide much-needed nuance
for describing the relationship between gun violence and economic health
at the community level. [[If gun violence is affecting employment, its
impact may **extend beyond individual communities**]{.mark}. When
considered nationwide, [gun violence could be a key factor in continuing
cycles of poverty]{.mark}; [it may also slow small business
growth]{.mark}, discourage creation of new small businesses [and
investment]{.mark}]{.underline} in communities, **[[and cause overall
economic growth to stagnate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These effects would
be most apparent in unevenly developed urban areas, where regional or
citywide crime statistics may hide pockets of crime and disadvantage in
certain neighborhoods. What comes next? This study joins previous
research in making the case to consider gun safety from a local economic
perspective. [We must consider safety and welfare not only in the
traditional sense, but in terms of creating an environment conducive to
investment and growth]{.underline}.

#### Turn -- reducing gun violence fosters economic growth.

**Justice Policy Center, '17**. "Economic Impacts of Gun Violence,"
https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/justice-policy-center/projects/economic-impacts-gun-violence

[[The psychological, social, and financial burdens gun violence places
on individuals and society]{.mark} are well-researched. This project
explores a different perspective on gun violence: its [impact]{.mark} on
community-level [economic health]{.mark}]{.underline}, about which
comparatively little is known. This series of publications shares
research based on newly available business establishment and credit
score data, along with gunshot and sociodemographic data by census tract
and gun homicide data in six cities. While the specific economic effects
of gun violence differ by city, the results demonstrate that gun
violence is detrimental to neighborhood economic health. "Surges" occur
when gun violence increases sharply and suddenly. [In the neighborhoods
where [gun violence surges]{.mark} take place, they [significantly
reduce the growth of]{.mark} new [retail and service]{.mark} businesses,
leading [fewer]{.mark} local [jobs]{.mark} to be available for
neighborhood residents and fewer local establishment available for
residents to shop at. And, [housing values appreciate]{.mark} more
[slowly]{.mark}]{.underline}. As part of this project, researchers spoke
to residents, business owners and civic organizations in these cities.
Interviews confirmed their experience matched what the data showed.
Business owners in these neighborhoods were forced to take on the cost
of enhanced security measures, while suffering because local residents
don't feel comfortable shopping after dark. [Residents shared the
perception that gun violence hurts their housing prices, driving
existing community members to relocate and prospective new residents to
avoid moving to affected neighborhoods]{.underline}. Among other things,
the project's research has led to the recommendation of increasing
public-private community partnerships in [[gun violence
reduction]{.underline}]{.mark}. These partnerships can lead to cycles
wherein business development promotes economic well-being, creates jobs,
and reduces gun violence, which [in turn [drives]{.mark} additional

Geoff **Dancy '18.**, an Assistant Professor at Tulane University, April

dots,"
https://www.openglobalrights.org/America-gun-violence-and-human-rights-Connecting-the-dot/

[[Researchers]{.mark} do [know about the devastating impact of guns
outside of the US. Small arms in the hands of abusive police forces,
government death squads, rebel warlords, terrorist groups, and
criminals]{.mark} intent on attacking local populations [is one of **the
gravest human rights concerns facing the world today**]{.mark}. If we
analyze civil wars overseas, we recognize that [promoting and
maintaining peace means **limiting access to
guns**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But if we turn that lens onto the US, we
see a number of worrisome signs: the presence of groups who stoke fear
about "enemies" taking over the country; people often claiming they may
need to take up arms against the government; and on top of this, droves
of civilians buying limitless numbers of guns. In any other country, we
might label this "rebel mobilization." Here, we just call it NRA TV
(National Rifle Association Television Station). The NRA is an easy
target, but this is by design. The NRA is meant to distract from the
machinations of gun manufacturers, who produce demerit goods for profit.
In the last ten years, the number of guns manufactured in the US
doubled. [In 2016 alone, 10 million guns were produced. There are now
more gun sellers in the US than there are Starbucks in the entire
world]{.underline}. **[[Gun manufacturers fuel the epidemic of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in our cities and schools. Between 2014
and 2016, the number of people killed by guns in the US exceeded the
number of battle deaths in all but one of the world's civil wars: Syria.
Like criminals and school shooters in the US, [groups fighting in these
civil **[wars use American-made guns]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 1AR Guns DA #1 -- Industry down now

#### Mass shootings are hurting the gun industry already.

America is silencing the gun industry," AXIOS,

[Banks, [financial institutions and]{.mark} retail [stores are all
pushing back against the gun industry]{.mark} by taking steps to slow
the sale of firearms and [blocking the industry\'s financial options in
response to]{.mark} the United States\' continued problems with **[mass
shootings]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The big picture: Second Amendment
advocates fear that Corporate America\'s pushback against the gun
industry could be a backdoor way --- without legislation or a
constitutional amendment --- to roll back Americans\' gun rights. The
state of play: [[Corporate entities are hesitant to support gun
manufacturers and sellers as]{.mark} today\'s **[social media]{.mark}**
age of instant reactions increasingly [demands that corporations take a
stand on social issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Payment processing firms
are limiting firearm transactions, per the Chicago Tribune. [Some
[financial institutions]{.mark}, including the Bank of America and
Citigroup, [have]{.mark} both [restricted]{.mark} their [business with
gun manufacturers]{.mark} and buyers in recent months]{.underline}.
[Walmart raised the age requirement to purchase firearms to
21]{.underline} in February. [Dick\'s Sporting Goods also raised its
minimum age to purchase firearms to 21 --- and banned the sale of
assault-style weapons]{.underline}.

### 1AR Guns DA #2&3 -- internal-link turn

#### Domestic gun violence stalls growth -- their impact only tells half the story

Yasemin **Irvin-Erickson et al, '17**., and Mathew Lynch, Annie Gurvis,
Edward Mohr, and Bing Bai, June 2017. "Gun Violence Affects the Economic
Health of Communities," URBAN INSTITUTE,
https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/90666/eigv_brief_3.pdf

[[Despite]{.mark} broad interest in [estimating]{.mark} the economic
[costs]{.mark} of gun violence borne by victims and the nation, these
[conversations rarely address the impact of gun violence on]{.mark} the
health of [local economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Do surges in gun
violence slow business growth and lower home values, homeownership
rates, and credit scores in communities? How do increases in gun
violence shape local economic health over time? To answer these
important questions, we assembled and analyzed newly available business
establishment and credit score data, along with gunshot and
sociodemographic data by census tract and gun homicide data (when
available), for Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland,
California; Rochester, New York; San Francisco, California; and
Washington, DC. Our findings demonstrate that sharp and sudden increases
(or surges) in [gun violence can significantly reduce the growth of new
retail and service businesses and slow home value appreciation. Further,
higher neighborhood gun violence can be associated with fewer retail and
service business establishments and new jobs. Higher [gun
violence]{.mark} also [can be associated with lower home values, credit
scores, and homeownership]{.mark} rates]{.underline}. Surges in gun
violence reduce the growth rate of new retail and service businesses.
Across Minneapolis, Oakland, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, gun
homicide surges in neighborhoods reduced the growth rate of new retail
and service establishments by 4 percent. City-specific analyses showed
the following:   In Minneapolis, each additional gun homicide in a
census tract in a given year was related to 80 fewer jobs the next year.
In Oakland, each additional gun homicide in a census tract in a given
year was related to 5 fewer job opportunities in shrinking businesses
the next year.  In Washington, DC, each additional gun homicide in a
census tract in a given year was related to two fewer retail and service
establishments the next year. Every 10 additional gunshots in a census
tract in a given year were related to one less new business opening, one
more business closing, and 20 fewer jobs in new establishments the same
year. Surges in gun violence slow home value appreciation. Across Baton
Rouge, Minneapolis, Oakland, Rochester, San Francisco, and Washington,
DC, gun violence surges in neighborhoods slowed home value appreciation
by approximately 4 percent. The analysis of gun homicides in 2014 and
home values, homeownership rates, and credit scores in 2015 demonstrated
that one more gun homicide in a census tract was associated with the
following outcomes:    a \$22,000 decrease in average home values in
Minneapolis and a \$24,621 decrease in Oakland, a 20-point decrease in
average credit score in Minneapolis and a 9-point decrease in Oakland,
and a 3 percent decrease in homeownership rates in Washington, DC, and a
1 percent decrease in Baton Rouge. [Conversations with [business owners,
homeowners, and city stakeholders]{.mark} in these cities [gave context
to these findings]{.mark}. Interviewees detailed the [significant
costs]{.mark} business owners incur because of gun violence---costs they
believe [are necessary to keep]{.mark} their [businesses open.
These]{.mark} costs [include]{.mark} security strategies such as [camera
systems]{.mark}, Plexiglas, [bulletproof windows]{.mark}, motion sensor
lights, bars on doors, [and]{.mark} extra [security staff]{.mark}.
Business owners and residents described the coping mechanisms that they
incorporated into their daily lives, such as businesses closing early,
business owners and managers keeping the doors locked at night during
operating hours, business owners increasing investment in security,
residents avoiding shopping during night hours, and employees who work
night shifts avoiding public transit. Residents, business owners, and
stakeholders shared their perception that gun violence hurts housing
prices, drives community members to relocate, and causes people to avoid
moving to affected neighborhoods]{.underline}. [These [results
demonstrate that gun violence reduces]{.mark} new business
[growth]{.mark} and local job opportunities, slows home value
appreciation, and can impact community members in many
ways]{.underline}. To escape a vicious cycle where [[gun violence
reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[economic resilience]{.mark}** of
communities]{.underline} whose members are already at risk of gun
violence, public policy and local efforts should promote a virtuous
cycle by simultaneously pursuing efforts to promote business
development, strengthen economic resilience of communities, and reduce
gun violence. Because these positive effects are self-reinforcing,
[[economic development and gun violence reduction efforts]{.mark} should
[go hand in hand]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This requires homeowners
and business owners to recognize their strong incentive to collaborate
with local governments and other community members in order to outline
the issues that need to be addressed and create policies and practical
solutions that are connected to the needs of local communities. Based on
our findings, we propose the following recommendations to translate
these findings into action: Publicize the economic impacts of gun
violence and promote success stories showing what communities can gain
from reducing gun violence.

Although [[the Putin government]{.underline}]{.mark}, unlike the Soviet
government's high point, [[is under significant economic stress and as a
result has little to offer in terms of material
support]{.underline}]{.mark}, it generously [[promises mega projects
that rarely come to fruition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additionally, Russia
has signed dozens of memoranda of understand- ing with Latin American
countries that are vague and, [[if consistent with past behavior, likely
to be left unfulfilled.]{.mark}]{.underline} The steadily expanding
[[Russian presence in Central America is spearheaded by two old allies
from the Cold War: Nicaragua]{.underline}]{.mark}n President Ortega and
José Luis Merino, [[a Communist Party leader in El
Salvador]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Russian presence is most visible in
Nicaragua, where Ortega, who successfully led a Marxist insurgency to
topple the U.S.-backed dictatorship of Anastacio Somoza, closely aligned
with the Soviet Union in the 1980s. While now portraying himself as a
less ortho- dox ideologue, Ortega and his inner circle have been
effusive in their praise of Russia's return to the region. Nicaragua now
consistently and publicly backs Russia in its con icts with the United
States and European Union In Central America, [[historically the Latin

#### No link -- Russia has no interest in Mexico and vice versa

**Miles, director of the U.S.-Mexico Futures Initiative, 18** (Richard,
February 26, "Russia Has Few Interests in Mexico,"
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia-has-few-interests-mexico>,
6/29/19)//SH

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has had a long but superficial
relationship with [[Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite regular
diplomatic and commercial relations since 1945, punctuated by periods of
shared antipathy toward the United States, [the two countries [have not
developed strong commercial]{.mark} or cultural
[ties]{.mark}]{.underline}. Except for a brief period of activity at the
height of the Cold War, featuring a strong Soviet intelligence presence
and limited arms sales, [[there is not much to build
on]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is not obvious how a victory by leftist
Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) in the July 1 Mexican presidential
election would necessarily advance Russian goals in Mexico, if those
goals indeed exist. [Though diplomats from both countries continue to
mouth niceties about increasing trade, apparently [few of their business
people are listening]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[For]{.mark} the entire year
of [2016]{.mark}, [Russia and Mexico had \$1.7 billion in trade]{.mark}.
[That is]{.mark} roughly [equal to the value of goods that cross the
U.S.-Mexico border every 31 hours]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Although
Mexican president Peña Nieto discussed possible Russian investment in
the oil sector with President Putin last year, nothing has come of
it.]{.underline} [[Mexico is Russia's 42th-largest export
market]{.underline}]{.mark}, representing less than half a percent of
its exports, [while [Russia is just 44th on Mexico's export
list]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mexico trades more in absolute terms with
neighboring Guatemala, a country about one-tenth the size of Russia and
more than twice as poor. [[Investment between the two countries is so
low it can barely be measured]{.mark}. In 2016, Russian direct
investment in Mexico was only \$2 million]{.underline}, which in the
same year almost could have purchased a 15-second Super Bowl commercial.
[[Mexico reported zero direct investment in Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Worldwide in 2016, Mexico pulled in over \$29 billion in foreign direct
investment from the rest of the world. Even [[the]{.mark} lucrative
[**arms trade** is missing from the Russia-Mexico bilateral
relationship]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Mexico last purchased Russian
weaponry in 2012]{.underline}, a \$20 million order for Mi-8 transport
helicopters. From 2006 to 2016, it purchased a total of \$61 million
worth of weaponry, all for Mi-8 helicopters. This was a small fraction
of the \$1.7 billion in weapons from other countries, principally the
United States, Spain, and France. [Russian sales to Mexico over the last
decade rank below those from the Netherlands]{.underline}. As a
strategic outpost during the Cold War, Mexico had some value to the
Soviet Union. The Soviet's large embassy, centrally located in a
pleasant area of Mexico City not far from the U.S. embassy (and close to
fashionable expatriate neighborhoods), served as a base for Russian
spies. It also was where Lee Harvey Oswald famously met with a KGB agent
six weeks before he shot President John F. Kennedy. But since the fall
of the Soviet empire in 1991, [[Russian diplomatic interest has
waned]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although President Vladimir Putin has met
twice with Mexican presidents (in 2004 with Vicente Fox and in 2012 with
Enrique Peña Nieto), [[high-level meetings are
infrequent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray made
his first trip to Moscow in late 2017, the first since President Felipe
Calderon's foreign minister, Patricia Espinosa, visited in 2011. Given
our knowledge of Russian interference in the U.S. elections in 2016 and
in the Catalonia referendum in 2017, it is plausible that the [Russians
may be trying to undermine the Mexican presidential
elections]{.underline} on July 1. Many observers point to a remark from
National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on December 15 in which he
warned of "signs of \[meddling\] in the Mexican presidential campaign."
But the U.S government has not publicly released any corroborating
information, and other press reports tend to be fact-free, anecdotal
stories of shadowy figures in Mexican politics, the media, and business
community. Hard evidence is difficult to come by. Apart from simply
sowing confusion, [it is not immediately obvious what the Russian's fake
news endgame in Mexico might be.]{.underline} Although an AMLO
victory---assuming the Russians want one---is likely to complicate
U.S.-Mexico relations, it would not be a strategic setback, in the way
that "losing" countries in the Cold War was perceived. López Obrador
also is advocating cuts to government spending, not for instance, a
military spending spree on Russian helicopters. Finally, with such a
tiny commercial relationship, there is little opportunity for bribes or
payoffs. [For corrupt Russian elites, [Mexico is not a growth
market]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2AC Gun tracking CP

#### Tracking/verification fails in Mexico - squo actively worsens these restrictions

**Lindsay-Poland 18** \[John, April 26, 2018, Coordinator of Stop US
Arms to Mexico, The Intercept, "How U.S. Guns Sold to Mexico End Up with
Security Forces Accused of Crime and Human Rights Abuses",
<https://theintercept.com/2018/04/26/mexico-arms-trade-us-gun-sales/>,
accessed 6/28/2019, DL\]

The State Department is supposed to track end users of U.S. arms
exports, to ensure that they don't go missing or end up in the hands of
criminal elements -- exactly as is feared is the case in Mexico. But the
[[methods for tracking gun shipments have systemic
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}, State Department officials admit behind
the scenes. And [with the Trump administration's proposed changes, the
process could be undermined even further.]{.underline}

Officials in the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls, speaking on background during a meeting last summer, told me
that [[U.S. and Mexican systems for identifying firearm
shipments]{.mark} from the United States to Mexico [are
incompatible]{.mark} and incapable of talking with each other, [making
it impossible to track firearm shipments without physical
inspections]{.mark}, which happen only occasionally.]{.underline}

In addition, [[when the]{.underline}]{.mark} State Department Bureau of
Human Rights, Democracy and Labor, or [[DRL]{.mark}, [receives firearms
exports license applications to review for human rights
concerns]{.mark}, approximately 80 percent of the applications show the
end user as the military in Mexico City]{.underline}, according to a DRL
official in December, who also spoke on background. That's [[entirely
inconsistent with SEDENA's data]{.mark}, which shows that most of more
than 305,000 firearms it distributed between 2010 and 2016 went to
police and private users outside Mexico City]{.underline}. (Although the
U.S. government compiles and releases some records on gun exports,
[Mexican public records requests have resulted in this more granular
look at the end users in Mexico of U.S. guns. But [Mexico [recently
passed an "Internal Security
Law,"](https://theintercept.com/2018/03/24/mexico-military-funding-trump-congress/) which
classifies more military information and may make it harder for the
public to access]{.mark} those [records.]{.mark})]{.underline}

When the applications did identify units that would receive the
firearms, according to a State Department official who spoke on
background in May 2017, [DRL did not crosscheck those units with a human
rights database known as INVEST]{.underline}, which is designed for
screening military and police units nominated for U.S. assistance[. A
State Department spokesperson said that commercial arms sales are
subject to a different process from assistance, "which still takes into
account reports of human rights violations, including by foreign
security units," but neglecting the INVEST database may help explain how
many end users with tarred records received U.S. gun
exports.]{.underline}

For its part, [[the Trump administration is poised to make the gun
export licensing system favor the arms industry even more]{.mark}, with
a planned transfer of export licensing from the State Department to the
Commerce Department]{.underline}.

[The [arms industry has long pushed for this change]{.mark} -- and won
significant changes from the Obama administration easing export
restrictions on many types of military equipment. Despite soaring arms
sales [under Obama, human rights controls remained]{.mark} nominally [a
priority]{.mark}, but [[many are
concerned](http://thehill.com/regulation/368425-planned-shift-on-gun-exports-kicks-up-storm) that
the Trump administration's overhaul will jettison
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. In announcing the Arms Trade Initiative last
week, the White House included human rights among the things to be taken
into consideration, but it remains to be seen how vetting will actually
be applied. A move to Commerce would remove congressional oversight of
the licenses, which has in the past [led to the
cancellation](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2017/09/26/us-lawmakers-balk-at-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-turkey-and-nigeria/) of
gun export deals to the Philippines -- where armed forces have allegedly
carried out thousands of extrajudicial killings -- and to Turkey's
presidential guard, after guard members beat up demonstrators in
Washington, D.C.

Furious, the largest of the "gunwalking" probes, [the ATF monitored the
sale of about 2,000 weapons and recovered only 710 of them]{.underline}.
And many of the guns tracked by the ATF have been found at crime scenes
on both sides of the U.S.- Mexican border and at scenes of mass murder
inside Mexico. [The war on drugs, spawned at the urging and financial

exported arms are used in atrocities and how exporting states can seek
to exercise controls. The German firm Heckler and Koch sold nearly
tenthousand G-36 assault rifles to Mexico between 2006 and 2009, on the
condition that they not send them to the conflictive states of
Chihuahua, Guerrero, Jalisco, and Chiapas. Yet dozens of the rifles were
recovered from the Iguala municipal police who participated in the
disappearance of the 43 Ayotzinapa students in September 2014. In
response, German prosecutors charged six Heckler and Koch employees with
criminal violations, and German officials visited Mexico to request
forgiveness of family members of the Ayotzinapa students.23 Police who

In May 2018, **[[the Trump administration proposed to make it easier to
export U.S. guns and ammunition globally.]{.mark} The proposed rule
treats semi-automatic assault rifles and other powerful firearms as
"non-military,"]{.underline}** moving export licenses from the State
Department to the Commerce Department and removing requirements for
Congressional and public notification of licenses for gun exports of
more than a million dollars. The proposed rule states that the weapons
that would remain under State Department regulation "are inherently for
military end use," and that weapons to be moved to Commerce Department
include "many items which are widely available in retail outlets in the
United States and abroad." One State Department official was quoted in a
press report about the proposed rule: "We kind of refer to it as the
Walmart rule. If it's like something you can buy at a Walmart, why
should we have control?" But the retail availability of firearms in the
United States should not be a criterion for export controls, since this
is not the market to which exports treated by the proposed rule will be
directed. In Mexico, the retail availability of all firearms is
substantially limited, with only one retail outlet in the entire country
for the legal purchase of any kind of firearm. **[Shortly after the
period for public comment on the proposed rule ended in July 2018, [the
State Department disclosed that it settled litigation to allow]{.mark}

rifles required a license under firearm export rules, and the State
Department had prevented it from occurring since 2013. Now, [organized

### #2 Ext -- Mexican-made guns

#### No solvency---Mexico's military makes all of their own weapons, plan can't stop the violence 

**BorderPolitics 18** (Martin Paredes, blogger, An immigrant's
insightful about the border economy, border politics & the border news,
"The Mexican Military Industrial Complex," 9/3/18,
https://epn.xyz/2018/09/13/the-mexican-military-industrial-complex/)

Looking at the aerospace industry in México yesterday, we saw how México
is growing its aerospace manufacturing prowess through strategic
partnerships with manufacturers. We also noted how the [Mexican military
has embarked on the plan to reduce its military reliance on foreign
equipment.]{.underline} The annual budget for the Mexican defense budget
is expected to continue growing in 2019. It is expected to be \$11.6
billion. [Although much attention has being placed on México's military
hardware buying "binge" since 2015]{.underline}, like 21 Blackhawk
helicopters, [the national budget has been spending considerable amounts
in bolstering its military manufacturing capabilities]{.underline}.
Besides technology development, México is investing in human capital
through its partnerships. The [self-reliance program has led to the
development of the Mexican military assault rifle]{.underline}, the
FX-05 Xiuhcóatl. [The FX-05]{.underline}, entirely designed and
manufactured in México [is being deployed as the official weapon for
Mexican military forces]{.underline}. According to the National Defense
Plan 2013-2018, México expects to have about 130,000 FX-05 rifles
deployed. The FX-05 is notable in that it replaces the imported Heckler
& Koch G3 with a smaller, lighter and is up to five times less expensive
for Mexican taxpayers. [The weapon uses the standard]{.underline} NATO
5[.56 round, also manufactured in México]{.underline}, and fires at a
faster rate than the G3. The comprehensive Mexican military industrial
program envisions [making México's military fully deployed with
indigenous military technology]{.underline}. [The program invests in
developing the infrastructure and engineering expertise towards the goal
of making all military equipment fully Mexican.]{.underline} As of last
year, [the Mexican military manufacturers its own military uniforms for
all services, tactical equipment like ballistic helmets and assault
rifle munitions.]{.underline} México manufactures military camouflage
low-IR uniforms for its troops with special physical recognition codes
to control falsified uniforms used by narco-soldiers to confuse the
public over the military's participation in drug operations. In
addition, México manufacturers its own ballistic combat helmet with
built in inflatable bladder providing soldiers better protection against
brain and head trauma. Eye protection and ballistic face masks are also
being deployed to soldiers offering soldiers operating on drug cartel
operations better protection while allowing them to conceal their faces
to protect against retaliation. Ballistic shirts with IR and IFF
identification tags, tactical body armor, fire retardant uniforms, load
carrying structures and combat boots are also being made in Mexican
companies. [Grenades, mortars and other heavy projectiles are now built
fully in México.]{.underline} In addition to these, [the Mexican
military is developing and deploying military aerial and ground drones.
The Mexican Navy is building its own class of littoral waters naval
fleet.]{.underline} [Mexican armored vehicles are also being designed
and deployed from Mexican factories.]{.underline} Since the 1980's,
México has been developing armored vehicles designed and manufactured in
México. The DN-III has evolved over the years. In 2015, the IBN
Industrias Militares and Plasan, an Israeli company, agreed to
manufacture the Sand Cat in México. The Sand Cat is a light armored
military vehicle. In 2014, [SEDENA revealed that México is on the verge
of deploying domestically designed, engineered and manufactured remote
controlled weapon]{.underline}s. The weapons systems includes a .70
caliber remote-fired weapon as well as grenade launchers. In April, the
Mexican government signed a letter of intent with Argentina to jointly
produce the IA-63 Pampa III, a light combat-capable jet trainer. [The
goal for the Mexican military is to use only Mexican manufactured
military equipment, from the uniforms to its military aircraft. The
program has been moving towards that goal for the last two
decades.]{.underline}

[State officials mixed up]{.mark} the [corpses, giving the wrong bodies

so. "If you're looking for a car, you can find the vehicle ID number if
it was stolen," said Mrs. Lopez. "But for people who are disappeared,
there is no database[." [Torture by the military and the police is still

human rights group (comitecerezo.org), who were imprisoned and tortured
for seven years. According to the Open Society Foundations report, as of
April 2015, there had been only six convictions for torture since 2007
and no convictions of military officials, despite thousands of
complaints of torture during the period. [[The militarization of Mexican
police has been accompanied by a dramatic rise in]{.mark} reports of

**Weisbrot, 9** ( co-director of the Centre for Economic and Policy

The US state department\'s annual human rights report got an unusual
amount of criticism this year. This time the centre-left [coalition
government of Chile was notable in joining other countries such as
Bolivia, Venezuela and China]{.underline} -- who have had more rocky
relations with Washington -- [[in questioning the moral authority of the
US government\'s judging other countries\' human rights
practices.]{.mark} It\'s a reasonable question, and the fact that more
democratic governments are asking it may signal a tipping point.
Clearly, [a state that is responsible for such high-profile torture and
abuses as took place at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo, that regularly killed
civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq and that reserved for itself the right
to kidnap people and send them to prisons in other countries to be
tortured ]{.mark}]{.underline}(\"extraordinary rendition\") [[has a
credibility problem]{.mark} on human rights issues.]{.underline}
Although President Barack [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} has pledged to
close down the prison at Guantánamo and outlaw torture by US officials,
he [[has so far decided not to abolish the practice of \"extraordinary
rendition\", and is escalating the war in
Afghanistan]{.mark}.]{.underline} But this tipping point may go beyond
any differences -- and they are quite significant -- between the current
administration and its predecessor.

#### 4. Death count comes first -- large potential losses suspend generic analysis.

Charles **Fried** "Rights and Wrongs as Absolute." Absolutism and Its
Consequentialist Critics. p. 76. Ed. Haber **1994**

Even within such boundaries [we can imagine extreme cases where killing
an innocent person may save a whole nation. In such cases it seems
fanatical to maintain the absoluteness of the judgment, to do right even
if the heavens will in fact fall. And so the catastrophic may cause the
absoluteness of right and wrong to yield]{.underline}, but even then it
would be a non sequitur to argue (as consequentialists are fond of
doing) that this proves that judgments of right and wrong are always a
matter of degree, depending on the relative goods to be attained and
harms to be avoided. I believe, on the contrary, that [the concept of
the catastrophic is a distinct concept just because it identifies the
extreme situations in which the usual categories of judgment (including
the category of right and wrong) no longer apply]{.underline}. At the
other end of the spectrum, there is the concept of the trivial, the de
minimis where the absolute categories do not yet apply. And the trivial
also does not prove that right and wrong are really only a matter of
degree. It is because of these complexities and because the term
absolute is really only suggestive of a more complex structure, that I
also refer to the norms of right and wrong not as absolute but as
categorical.

[**Taken together, the violence unleashed by criminal groups, the
corruption of police, and the government's lack of transparency led**
Stanford University researcher Beatriz Magaloni **to** speak of **"the
collapse of the Mexican State."**]{.underline}8 **[The long list of
corruption scandals includes charges against several state governors for
close ties to organized criminal groups]{.underline}**. Current or
former governors of at least five different Mexican states have been
charged with crimes ranging from illicit enrichment and the diversion of
millions of dollars (Tabasco Governor Andrés Rafael Granier Melo) to the
death of 17 people (Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte) to participation in
the Juarez Cartel criminal organization (former Quintana Roo governor
Mario Villanueva Madrid).9 Since civilian government leaders have both
formal command and informal relationships with police forces, their
involvement in corruption impacts state forces' relationships with
organized crime, as well. **[The disappearance of the 43 students in
Guerrero, who were handed over by the police to a local criminal gang,
reflects the level of cooperation between the Mexican State and criminal
organizations.]{.underline}** "Ayotzinapa was the event that uncovered
all that was happening in Guerrero, which many of us knew, because we
heard but we didn't know the depth of the reality people were
experiencing," Alejandro Ramos of the Morelos y Pavón Human Rights
Center in Guerrero (centromorelos.org) told us. "And the reality is that
the Guerrero authorities, the whole state government, and the federal
and municipal governments are in collusion with organized crime."

[Corruption of government authorities does damage under any conditions.
**Public funds are pocketed, favoritism hurts the quality of public
services**, and decreased trust in authorities and institutions often
means community members have nowhere to go for justice and other basic
government functions. The problem is compounded when **state agencies
collaborate with violent organized criminal groups--- the same state
agencies that are the designated institutions for fighting such
organized crime**, and are the chosen U.S. partners to do
so.]{.underline} Mexico is considered the most corrupt of all 34 nations

#### Inability to solve corruption makes structural violence inevitable

of gangs, vigilantes fuels rising Mexican violence",

What now passes for the law in Xaltianguis, a little town on the road to
Acapulco, arrived with a car bomb and butchery. A heavily armed
vigilante force took over the town in the Mexican state of Guerrero last
month by driving out a rival band, blowing up a car with gas cylinders
and cutting up the body of one of two fallen foes. Residents cowered in
their homes or fled down the highway through mountainous tropical
scrubland. Police and troops guarding Xaltianguis did nothing. Now, a
few hundred yards (meters) from the new "community police" base the
force set up, [[Mexican]{.mark} marines and state
[police]{.mark}]{.underline} [guard the highway and make patrol sorties
through the town. But they have]{.underline} [[made no attempt to
arrest]{.mark} the [vigilantes]{.mark} even [though most openly carry
illegal assault]{.mark} [rifles]{.mark}.]{.underline} "We have the town
practically bullet-proofed by the government. At the entrances to the
town you can see the army, the marines, all levels of government here
supporting us," boasted Daniel Adame, the leader of the group that took
over Xaltianguis. Members of a FUPCEG vigilante group patrol past
pedestrians in Xaltianguis, Guerrero state, Mexico, Wednesday, May 29,
2019. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) It is a scene repeated over and over
again in southern Mexico[: So-called "[community police" or
"self-defense" groups,]{.mark} often [accused of drug cartel
ties]{.mark} themselves, [have proliferated and extended]{.mark} their
control over [territory.]{.mark}]{.underline} [And time after time,
outnumbered [soldiers don't intervene]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in
part because they are afraid of opening fire on civilians. Many had
expected violence to taper off in Guerrero as synthetic opioids like
fentanyl knocked the bottom out of the opium market that had fed
organized crime groups in the state. In fact, homicides in the
notoriously violent state dropped by 36% in the first three months of
the year. But it now appears [[a new round of violence is only
starting]{.mark}, pitting warring gangs against vigilante
squads]{.underline} fighting over fuel theft, gold mines and routes for
precursor chemicals. [[Thousands have been displaced]{.mark} by the
fighting]{.underline}, and the toxic mix of cartels, hired killers,
vigilante police forces have essentially neutralized the Mexican
military, forcing troops into the role of mere spectators, or worse,
hostages. Adame is a far call from the vigilante leaders of past years,
townsfolk who armed themselves with shotguns and single-shot rifles to
defend their towns from drug cartels. [Critics say [rival gangs often
infiltrated the ranks of "community police"
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The leader of the FUPCEG vigilante
group --- the United Front of Guerrero Community Police --- is a
self-described businessman who owns a lion and exotic birds and has an
expensive AR-15 with a telescopic sight. His son carries a pistol with
carved silver handgrips. He defended the use of the car-bomb, saying
other vigilante groups like the rival UPOEG --- the Union of Towns and
Organizations of Guerrero --- also use explosives. His group took over,
he said, because the other group is tied to organized crime, an
assertion UPOEG tosses back at his force. Townspeople confirmed that
FUPCEG took over the town in mid-May and ran rival vigilantes out,
killing two and carving up the body of one man with bayonet-like knives.
Just across the state line in neighboring Michoacan, a group of
vigilantes who state Gov. Silvano Aureoles described as "criminals,
nothing more," shoved a squad of a half dozen soldiers up against a
wall, took their weapons, and pushed and insulted them until they agreed
to return a .50 caliber snipers' rifle that had been seized by a
previous patrol. Despite that humiliation, President Andrés Manuel López
Obrador invited the soldiers to the National Palace a few days later to
personally "thank them and reward their calm and grace under pressure,
which avoided the death of innocent people," according to the Defense
Department. Armed members of the FUPCEG vigilante group drive past
Mexican soldiers in Xaltianguis, Guerrero state, Mexico Wednesday, May
29, 2019. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) That drew a howl of concern from
the Mexican Employers' Federation, one of the country's leading business
groups. "The armed forces are the only viable force to restore order and
peace," the group said in a statement. "The president has ordered the
army to protect the nation's territory, and at the same time has asked
them never to confront civilians\..." It complained the order "prevents
them from confronting criminal gangs or paramilitary groups." And such
[[groups are increasingly powerful and willing to challenge]{.mark} the
[armed forces]{.mark}.]{.underline} Salvador Alanis is a strategist and
spokesman for the FUPCEG, the group that took over Xaltianguis. He said
the group has as many as 9,000 men under arms in a string of towns it
controls, outnumbering the Mexican army in the state. Nor is Alanis
loath to take on soldiers. "One time the army came and fired tear gas at
women, and we didn't allow that," Alanis recalled. López Obrador is
betting his security strategy on the newly created National Guard, a
sort of militarized police force that is expected to be deployed in
Guerrero in about a month. But if the Guard faces the limits the army
faces, it will immediately be at a disadvantage in states like Guerrero
and Michoacan. "I'm telling the federal government right now, this could
happen to your National Guard, because if one of these guys opens fire,
it will be a massacre on both sides," said Alanis, who claimed to have
an arrangement with local army commanders in Guerrero to leave his
forces alone. "It's a relationship of tolerance, if not coordination,"
said Alanis. "You don't mess with us, and we don't mess with you." While
most of the vigilante forces are recruited from local men, Alanis said
his group also employs about 100 gunmen trained to kill for taking over
towns. He calls them "a team that comes to destroy." "They are ready to
kill or die for whatever you give them," said Alanis. And as the
[[vigilantes grow harder to distinguish from cartels]{.mark}, the
[cartels also are growing bolder]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the Michoacan
town of Zamora, the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel paraded through
town in May in a convoy of at least two dozen pickups and SUVs --- all
proudly bearing the cartel's initials "CJNG" on their doors and sides.
With soldiers standing by as towns are taken over, [the [conflicts
i]{.mark}n some areas [are becoming almost
medieval]{.mark}.]{.underline} Residents of the town of Chichihualco
have dug trenches across the highway leading to the FUPCEG stronghold in
the village of Filo de Caballos because Alanis has repeatedly threatened
to take over Chichihualco. Others have set up roadblocks to defend their
towns. Driving the back roads of Guerrero these days means passing
dozens of roadblocks manned by men in civilian clothes with assault
rifles. "Comandante Geronimo" stood by one such bullet-riddled barricade
made of sandbags. A member of the UPOEG, he has endured attacks about
every two months from FUPCEG to the south and the Ardillos drug gang to
the north. Geronimo --- who won't give his real name for fear of
reprisals --- explained why [[there is]{.mark} such [heavy fighting
for]{.mark} such small, [poor towns]{.mark}]{.underline}. "There's a
crisis now in the mountains and the criminal gangs aren't blockheads,"
he said. "They say this (opium) isn't going to be a business, but the
mines are. So I think a month of crisis is coming." The Canadian-owned
gold mines that dot the mountains have historically been shaken down for
protection payments by gangs. Now gold has been discovered at other
spots in the state, raising the prospect that cartels or vigilante
groups may want to take a direct role in the mines. Others believe the
groups want to take control of routes to the seaport of Acapulco to move
precursor chemicals now that synthetic opioids have displaced the
region's natural-grown opium poppies. "We thought that once the opium
poppy business died out, the violence was going to end," said David
Barragan, a resident of Los Moros who was forced from his village by the
incursion of Alanis' FUPCEG forces. Like many residents of the
mountains, Barragan long depended on planting an acre or two of poppies
to bring in cash. But when prices dropped a couple of years ago,
Barragan turned to his stand of avocado trees, the new "green gold" in
the mountains of southern Mexico. But now the vigilantes have seized his
avocado orchard and are harvesting the fruit he has waited for two years
to mature. Barragan, like hundreds of his neighbors --- and
[[thousands]{.mark} throughout the state --- has
[fled]{.mark}.]{.underline} He says [[people won't take it]{.mark} much
longer.]{.underline} "The National Guard is what we most need up here,
and have been waiting for, but if it doesn't work, we are going to take
other measures," Barragan said, adding a lot of his neighbors are
thinking of getting guns.

### #4 Ext -- util good

#### Utilitarian evaluation is superior to focusing on ethics -- their arguments are warrants for self-centered ignorance, not informed policy-making.

Jeffrey C. **Isaac**, Professor of Political Science and director of the
Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life at Indiana University,
Spring **2002**, Dissent, Ends, means, and politics

[Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is
the core of politics. Power is the ability to effect outcomes in the
world. Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution
and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world, one
must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it
about]{.underline}. And to develop such means is to develop, and to
exercise, power. To say [this is not to say that power is beyond
morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to
morality]{.underline}. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max
Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, [an unyielding
concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility. The
concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal
integrity, but it]{.underline} suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It
[fails to see that the purity of one\'s intention does not ensure the
achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or refusing to make
common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right
thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view
them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their
supporters]{.underline}; (2) [it fails to see that in a world of real
violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of
powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in
injustice]{.underline}. This is why, from the standpoint of
politics\--as opposed to religion\--[pacifism is always a potentially
immoral stand]{.underline}. In categorically repudiating violence, it
refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any
effect; and (3) [it fails to see that politics is as much about
unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of
action, rather than the motives of action, that is most
significant]{.underline}. Just as the alignment with \"good\" may
engender impotence, [it is often the pursuit of \"good\" that generates
evil]{.underline}. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth
century: [it is not enough that one\'s goals be sincere or idealistic;
it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing
these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically
contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It
alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And
it undermines political effectiveness]{.underline}.

#### Investigation of different political strategies to strive for ethical outcomes is superior to demands for purity.

Jeffrey C. **Isaac**, Professor of Political Science and director of the
Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life at Indiana University,
Spring **2002**, Dissent, Ends, means, and politics

Second, it would mean frankly acknowledging something well understood,
often too eagerly embraced, by the twentieth century Marxist left\--that
[it is often politically necessary to employ morally troubling means in
the name of morally valid ends. A just or even a better society can only
be realized in and through political practice; in our complex and bloody
world, it will sometimes be necessary to respond to barbarous tyrants or
criminals, with whom moral suasion won\'t work. In such situations our
choice is not between the wrong that confronts us and our ideal vision
of a world beyond wrong. It is between the wrong that confronts us and
the means\--perhaps the dangerous means\--we have to employ in order to
oppose it]{.underline}. In such situations [there is a danger that
\"realism\" can become a rationale for the Machiavellian worship of
power. But equally great is the danger of a righteousness that
translates, in effect, into a refusal to act in the face of
wrong]{.underline}. What is one to do? [Proceed with
caution]{.underline}. [Avoid casting oneself as the incarnation of pure
goodness locked in a Manichean struggle with evil]{.underline}. Be wary
of violence. [Look for alternative means when they are available, and
support the development of such means when they are not]{.underline}.
And [never sacrifice]{.underline} democratic freedoms and open
[debate]{.underline}. Above all, [ask the hard questions about the
situation at hand, the means available, and the likely effectiveness of
different strategies]{.underline}.

### 1NC Frontline -- Cartels

#### 1. Cartels are too key -- Mexico's economy is reliant on things like the drug trade, plan causes quick collapse

The linkages attending drug traffi cking are many; their impacts
hauntingly far reaching**[. The [illicit trade]{.mark} in drugs [has
become an integral part of Mexico's economy. Operating through vast
networks]{.mark} of street and prison gangs, police, customs offi cials,
front companies, banks, and many others, [Mexican cartels]{.mark} employ
an estimated 450,000 people; [have operations throughout the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited States and in parts of [Central and South America, as
well as Europe]{.mark}; and take in between \$25 billion and \$30
billion a year.]{.underline}** Robert J. Bunker and John P. Sullivan
estimate that the livelihood of some **[3.2 million people in Mexico
depends on the illicit trade in [narcotics]{.mark},]{.underline}** a fi
gure that does not include the thousands of people and billions of
dollars involved in combating it (Bunker, 41). Indeed, [DTOs provide fi
nancial opportunities where few others exist and [pump]{.mark} needed
[funds into local economies]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[Drug traffickers
pay for "schools and hospitals, pour\[ing\] money into churches and
homes"]{.underline}** (Beith, 87**[). They provide "gifts to children,
assist victims of natural disasters, \[and\] generate employment in poor
areas"]{.underline}** (Grayson, 122). Overall, Charles **[Bowden
estimates that between 30 percent and 60 percent of the Juárez economy
runs on laundered drug money]{.underline}** (45). **[[The contrasting
forces of corruption and coercion]{.mark} in turn [link the drug trade
to the state]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Considered the sine qua non of the
drug trade, corruption is a major focus of all the works under review.
They all address how governors, mayors, high-ranking offi cials in
federal law enforcement, and military offi cers provide DTOs with access
to the transportation routes needed to move their merchandise; **[how
[cartels buy the loyalty and protection of district commanders of the
federal police and military]{.mark}; how police at all levels of
government affi liated with drug cartels intimidate, kidnap, and murder
their opponents, provide inside information to cartel leaders, and warn
them via pitazos (tips) of antidrug operations;]{.underline}** how
seized drugs often seem to disappear; how bribes to customs offi cials
at airports facilitate the transportation of merchandise; and how bribes
to prison offi cials allow capos either to continue to run their
operations from behind bars or to escape, as in the case of "El Chapo"
Guzmán. The degree of integration of drug traffi ckers and state offi
cials is extensive institutionally and geographically, as well as
long-standing. Bowden notes**[: "In over a half century of fi ghting
drugs, Mexico has never created a police unit that did not join the
traffi ckers. Or die"]{.underline}** (109). Bunker and Sullivan estimate
that 1,500 cities have been infi ltrated by cartels (Bunker, 41).
Malcolm Beith summarizes the situation quite simply: "Anyone could be
bought" (68). Some see infi ltration to extend beyond merely buying
protection to actually challenging the state itself. According to the
municipal president of Durango, from the Partido Acción Nacional (PAN),
as summarized by George W. Grayson, DTOs have begun to erect a "parallel
state" and to carry out "traditional government functions such as
collecting taxes (in the form of extortion) and providing security (in
return for payments)" (124). This political danger is perhaps the major
concern behind the collection of essays edited by
Bunker**[.]{.underline}**

#### 3. No impact to failed states -- data

MICHAEL J. **MAZARR '14.**, Professor of National Security Strategy at
the National War College, Foreign Affairs, January/February 2014, \"The
Rise and Fall of the Failed-State Paradigm\",
http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140347/michael-j-mazarr/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-failed-state-paradigm

THE DECLINE OF A STRATEGIC NARRATIVE

The practical challenges of state-building missions are now widely
appreciated. They tend to be long, difficult, and expensive, with
success demanding an open-ended commitment to a messy, violent, and
confusing endeavor \-- something unlikely to be sustained in an era of
budgetary austerity. But [the last decade has driven home intellectual
challenges to the concept]{.underline} as well.

[[The threat posed by weak and fragile states]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, **[[turned out to be both less urgent and more complex]{.mark}
and diffuse [than]{.mark} was originally
[suggested]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Foreign Policy's Failed States
Index]{.underline} for 2013 [is not exactly a roster of national
security priorities; of its top 20 weak states, very few]{.underline}
(Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan) [boast geostrategic
significance]{.underline}, and they do so mostly because of their
connection to terrorism. But **[[even the threat of terrorism isn't
highly correlated with]{.mark} the current roster of [weak
states]{.mark}]{.underline}**; only one of the top 20, Sudan, appears on
the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, and most
other weak states have only a marginal connection to terrorism at best.

A lack of definitional rigor posed a second problem. [There has never
been a coherent set of factors that define failed states]{.underline}:
As the political scientist Charles Call argued in a powerful 2008
corrective, the concept resulted in the "agglomeration of diverse
criteria" that worked to "throw a monolithic cloak over disparate
problems that require tailored solutions." This basic methodological
flaw would distort state-building missions for years, as outside powers
forced generic, universal solutions onto very distinct contexts.

The **[[specified dangers were never unique to weak
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, moreover, nor would state-building
campaigns necessarily have mitigated them. Take terrorism[. The most
effective terrorists tend to be products of the middle
class]{.underline}, often [from nations such as Saudi Arabia, Germany,
and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom, **[not
impoverished citizens of failed states]{.underline}**. And **[terrorist
groups operating in weak states can shift their bases of
operations]{.underline}**: [if Afghanistan becomes too risky, they can
uproot themselves and move to Somalia, Yemen, or even
Europe]{.underline}. As a result, "stabilizing" three or four sources of
extremist violence would not render the United States secure. [The same
could be said of threats such as organized crime, which finds
comfortable homes in functioning]{.underline} but troubled [states in
Asia, eastern Europe, and Latin America.]{.underline}

As the scholar Stewart Patrick noted in a 2006 examination of the
purported threats issuing from weak states, "**[[What is striking is how
little empirical evidence underpins these
assertions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policy developments.
**[[Analysts]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policymakers alike **[[have
simply presumed the existence of a blanket connection between state
weakness and threats to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}** of developed countries and have begun to
recommend and implement policy responses."

#### 4. Econ decline doesn't cause war \-\-- no diversionary conflicts 

**Barnett 9** (Thomas, Senior Strategic Researcher -- Naval War College,
"The New Rules: Security Remains Stable Amid Financial Crisis", Asset
Protection Network, 8-25,
http://www.aprodex.com/the-new-rules\--security-remains-stable-amid-financial-crisis-398-bl.aspx)

[When the]{.underline} global [financial crisis struck]{.underline}
roughly a year ago, [the blogosphere was ablaze with]{.underline} all
sorts of [scary]{.underline} [predictions of]{.underline}, and
commentary regarding, [ensuing]{.underline} conflict and [wars \-- a
rerun of the Great Depression leading to world war]{.underline}, as it
were. Now, as global economic news brightens and recovery \--
surprisingly led by China and emerging markets \-- is the talk of the
day, it\'s interesting to look back over the past year and realize how
globalization\'s first truly [[worldwide recession has had virtually no
impact]{.mark} whatsoever [on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[international
security]{.underline}]{.mark} landscape. [[No]{.mark}ne of
the]{.underline} more than three-dozen [[ongoing
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} listed by GlobalSecurity.org [[can
be]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[attributed to the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[global [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[the last new
entry]{.underline}]{.mark} (civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah
[in]{.underline} the [Palestine]{.underline}) [[predates
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [economic [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} by a
year, and three quarters of the chronic struggles began in the last
century. Ditto for the 15 low-intensity conflicts listed by Wikipedia
(where the latest entry is the Mexican \"drug war\" begun in 2006).
Certainly, the Russia-Georgia conflict last August was specifically
timed, but by most accounts the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics
was the most important external trigger (followed by the U.S.
presidential campaign) for that sudden spike in an almost two-decade
long struggle between Georgia and its two breakaway regions. Looking
over the various databases, then, we see a most familiar picture: the
usual mix of civil conflicts, insurgencies, and liberation-themed
terrorist movements. [Besides]{.underline} the recent
[Russia-Georgia]{.underline} dust-up, [[the only]{.underline}]{.mark}
two potential [[state-on-state wars]{.underline}]{.mark} ([North v.
South [Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [Israel v.
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} both tied to one
side acquiring a nuclear weapon capacity \-- a process [[wholly
unrelated to]{.mark} global [economic trends]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[[with the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates effectively [[tied down]{.mark}
by]{.underline} its two ongoing major interventions (Iraq and
[Afghanistan]{.underline}-bleeding-into-Pakistan), our [[involvement
elsewhere]{.underline}]{.mark} around the planet [[has been]{.mark}
quite [modest]{.mark}]{.underline}, both leading up to and following the
onset of the economic crisis: e.g., the usual counter-drug efforts in
Latin America, the usual military exercises with allies across Asia,
mixing it up with pirates off Somalia\'s coast). [[Everywhere]{.mark}
else [we find]{.mark}]{.underline} serious [[instability
we]{.underline}]{.mark} pretty much [[let it burn]{.underline}]{.mark},
occasionally pressing the Chinese \-- unsuccessfully \-- to do
something. Our new Africa Command, for example, hasn\'t led us to
anything beyond advising and training local forces. So, [[to sum
up]{.underline}]{.mark}: [No significant uptick in]{.underline} mass
[violence or unrest]{.underline} (remember the smattering of urban riots
last year in places like Greece, Moldova and Latvia?); The usual
frequency maintained in civil conflicts (in all the usual places); [[Not
a single state-on-state war directly caused]{.underline}]{.mark} ([[and
no great-power]{.underline}]{.mark}-on-great-power [[crises]{.mark} even
[triggered]{.mark}]{.underline}); [No]{.underline} great improvement or
[disruption in]{.underline} great-power [cooperation
regarding]{.underline} the emergence of new [nuclear powers]{.underline}
(despite all that diplomacy); A modest scaling back of international
policing efforts by the system\'s acknowledged Leviathan power
(inevitable given the strain); and No serious efforts by any rising
great power to challenge that Leviathan or supplant its role. (The worst
things we can cite are Moscow\'s occasional deployments of strategic
assets to the Western hemisphere and its weak efforts to outbid the
United States on basing rights in Kyrgyzstan; but the best include China
and India stepping up their aid and investments in Afghanistan and
Iraq.) Sure, we\'ve finally seen global defense spending surpass the
previous world record set in the late 1980s, but even that\'s likely to
wane given the stress on public budgets created by all this
unprecedented \"stimulus\" spending. If anything, the friendly
cooperation on such stimulus packaging was the most notable great-power
dynamic caused by the crisis. [Can we say]{.underline} that [the world
has suffered a]{.underline} distinct [shift to]{.underline} political
[radicalism]{.underline} as a result of the economic crisis? Indeed,
[no]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} world\'s [major economies
remain]{.underline} governed by [center-left]{.underline} or
center-right political factions that remain decidedly friendly to both
markets and trade. [In the short run, there were]{.underline} attempts
across the board to insulate economies from immediate damage (in effect,
as much [protectionism]{.underline} as allowed under current trade
rules), [but]{.underline} there was [no great slide into \"trade
wars.\"]{.underline} Instead, [the]{.underline} [W]{.underline}orld
[T]{.underline}rade [O]{.underline}rganization [is
functioning]{.underline} as it was designed to function, and regional
efforts toward free-trade agreements have not slowed. Can we say
[Islamic radicalism]{.underline} was inflamed by the economic crisis? If
it was, that shift [was clearly overwhelmed by]{.underline} the Islamic
world\'s growing [disenchantment with]{.underline} the brutality
displayed by violent extremist groups such as [al-Qaida]{.underline}.
And looking forward, austere economic times are just as likely to breed
connecting evangelicalism as disconnecting fundamentalism. At the end of
the day, the economic crisis did not prove to be sufficiently
frightening to provoke major economies into establishing global
regulatory schemes, even as it has sparked a spirited \-- and much
needed, as I argued last week \-- discussion of the continuing viability
of the U.S. dollar as the world\'s primary reserve currency. Naturally,
plenty of experts and pundits have attached great significance to this
debate, seeing in it the beginning of \"economic warfare\" and the like
between \"fading\" America and \"rising\" China. And yet, in a world of
globally integrated production chains and interconnected financial
markets, such \"diverging interests\" hardly constitute signposts for
wars up ahead. Frankly, I don\'t welcome a world in which America\'s
fiscal profligacy goes undisciplined, so bring it on \-- please! Add it
all up and it\'s fair to say that this global financial crisis has
proven the great resilience of America\'s post-World War II
international liberal trade order. Do I expect to read any analyses
along those lines in the blogosphere any time soon? Absolutely not. I
[expect the fantastic fear-mongering to proceed]{.underline} apace.
[That\'s what the Internet is for]{.underline}.

### #3 Ext -- Failed states no impact

**State failure doesn't spillover into a global threat -- no impact**

Dr. Bernard I. **Finel '9**, an Atlantic Council contributing editor, is
a senior fellow at the American Security Project, "Afghanistan is
Irrelevant," Apr 27
http://www.acus.org/new_atlanticist/afghanistan-irrelevant

It is now a deeply entrenched conventional wisdom that the decision to
"abandon" Afghanistan after the Cold War was a tragic mistake. In the
oft-told story, our "abandonment" led to civil war, state collapse, the
rise of the Taliban, and inevitably terrorist attacks on American soil.
This narrative is now reinforced by dire warnings about the risks to
Pakistan from instability in Afghanistan. Taken all together, critics of
the Afghan commitment now find themselves facing a nearly unshakable
consensus in continuing and deepen our involvement in Afghanistan. [The
problem with the consensus is that virtually **every part of it is
wrong**. Abandonment did not cause the collapse of the state. [Failed
states are not]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}always [[a threat]{.mark}
to U.S. national security]{.underline}. And Pakistan's problems have
little to do with the situation across the border. First, [the collapse
of the Afghan state after the Soviet withdrawal had little to do with
Western abandonment. Afghanistan has always been beset by powerful
centrifugal forces. The country is poor, the terrain rough, the
population divided into several ethnic groups]{.underline}. Because of
this, [the country has rarely been unified even nominally and has never
really had a strong central government]{.underline}. The dominant
historical political system in Afghan is warlordism. This is not a
consequence of Western involvement or lack thereof. [It is a function of
geography]{.underline}, economics, and demography. Second, there is no
straight-line between state failure and threats to the United States.
Indeed, [the problem with Afghanistan was not that it failed but rather
that it "unfailed" and becameruled by the Taliban. [Congo/Zaire is a
failed state. Somalia is a failed state]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [There
are many parts of the globe that are essentially
ungoverned]{.underline}]{.mark}. Clearly criminality, human rights
abuses, and other global ills flourish in these spaces. But [[the notion
that any and all ungoverned space represents a core national security
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to the United States [[is]{.mark} simply
**[unsustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, the problem was the
Taliban regime was not that it existed. It was that it was allowed to
fester without any significant response or intervention. We largely
sought to ignore the regime --- refusing to recognize it despite its
control of 90% of Afghan territory. Aside from occasional tut-tutting
about human rights violations and destruction of cultural sites, the
only real interaction the United States sought with the regime was in
trying to control drugs. Counter-drug initiatives are not a sound
foundation for a productive relationship for reasons too numerous to
enumerate here. Had we recognized the Taliban and sought to engage the
regime, it is possible that we could have managed to communicate red
lines to them over a period of years. Their failure to turn over bin
Laden immediately after 9/11 does not necessarily imply an absolute
inability to drive a wedge between the Taliban and al Qaeda over time.
Fourth, we are now told that defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan is
imperative in order to help stabilize Pakistan. But, most observers seem
to think that Pakistan is in worse shape now --- with the Taliban out of
power and American forces in Afghanistan --- than it was when the
Taliban was dominant in Afghanistan. For five years from 1996 to 2001,
the Taliban ruled Afghanistan and the Islamist threat to Pakistan then
was unquestionably lower. This is not surprising actually. Insurgencies
are at their most dangerous --- in terms of threat of contagion --- when
they are fighting for power. The number of insurgencies [that actually
manage to sponsor insurgencies elsewhere after taking power is
surprising low]{.underline}. [[The domino theory is]{.mark} as
[dubious]{.mark} in the case of Islamist movements as it was in the case
of Communist expansion.]{.underline}

#### Their impact is based on faulty anecdotal evidence

Stewart **Patrick '11**, Program on International Institutions and
Global Governance at CFR, May, "Weak Links Fragile States, Global
Threats, and International Security" Excerpt from forthcoming book,
http://www.cfr.org/international-peace-and-security/weak-links/p24311?excerpt=1

[What is striking]{.underline}, in view of this flurry of official
activity, [is how [little empirical analysis has been undertaken to
document and explore the connection between state failure and
transnational security threats]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Policymakers have
advanced blanket associations between these two sets of
phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark}[, often [on the basis of
anecdotes]{.mark} or single examples (e.g., al-Qaeda operations in
Afghanistan before 9/11) [rather than]{.mark} through [sober analysis of
global patterns or in-depth case studies that reveal causal linkages.
Such sweeping generalizations provide little]{.mark} analytical
[insight]{.mark} or guidance for policymakers in setting
priorities]{.underline}, since they fail to distinguish among categories
of weak and failing states or to ask whether (or why) particular
developing countries are associated with specific sets of threats. This
book aims to fill these gaps by analyzing the relationship between state
weakness and five of the world's most pressing transnational threats.

### #4 Ext -- econ no impact

#### No diversionary war due to econ collapse

**Bennett and Nordstrom 2000** -- department of political science at
Penn State (D Scott and Timothy, The Journal of Conflict Resolution,
44:1, "Foreign policy substitutability and internal economic problems in
enduring rivalries", ProQuest, WEA)

[Conflict settlement is]{.underline} also [a distinct route to dealing
with internal problems]{.underline} that leaders in rivalries may pursue
when faced with internal problems. [[Military]{.mark}
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} between states
[[requires]{.mark}]{.underline} large amounts of [[resources]{.mark},
and rivals require even more attention. Leaders may choose to negotiate
a settlement that ends a rivalry to free up]{.underline} important
[resources]{.underline} [t]{.mark}hat may be reallocated to the domestic
economy. [In a \"guns versus butter\" world of economic
trade-offs]{.underline}, when a state can no longer afford to pay the
expenses associated with competition in a rivalry, [[it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[rational for leaders to reduce costs by
ending a rivalry.]{.mark}]{.underline} This gain (a peace dividend)
could be achieved at any time by ending a rivalry. However, such a gain
is likely to be most important and attractive to leaders when internal
conditions are bad and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active
problems. [[Support for policy change **away from continued rivalry is
more likely to develop when the economic situation sours and
elites**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and masses]{.underline} **[[are looking
for ways to improve a worsening situation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is
at these times that the pressure to cut military investment will be
greatest and that state leaders will be forced to recognize the
difficulty of continuing to pay for a rivalry. Among other things, this
argument also encompasses the view that the cold war ended because the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could no longer compete economically
with the United States.

#### Economy is resilient

**Zakaria 9** (Fareed, Ph.D. in Political Science -- Harvard University
and Editor -- Newsweek International, "The Secrets of Stability",
Newsweek, 12-21, Lexis)

[One year ago, the world seemed as if it might be coming
apart]{.underline}. [The global financial system]{.underline}, which had
fueled a great expansion of capitalism and trade across the world, [was
crumbling]{.underline}. All the certainties of the age of
-globalization\--about the virtues of free markets, trade, and
technology\--were being called into question. Faith in the American
model had collapsed. The financial industry had crumbled. Once-roaring
emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil were sinking. Worldwide
trade was shrinking to a degree not seen since the 1930s.
[[Pundits]{.underline}]{.mark} whose bearishness had been vindicated
[[predicted]{.mark} we were doomed to]{.underline} a long, painful bust,
with [[cascading failures]{.mark} in sector after sector]{.underline},
[country after country]{.underline}. In a widely cited essay that
appeared in The Atlantic this May, Simon Johnson, former chief economist
of the International Monetary Fund, wrote: \"The conventional wisdom
among the elite is still that the current slump \'cannot be as bad as
the Great Depression.\' This view is wrong. What we face now could, in
fact, be worse than the Great Depression.\" [Others
predicted]{.underline} that these [economic shocks would lead
to]{.underline} political [instability]{.underline} and violence in the
worst-hit countries. At his confirmation hearing in February, the new
U.S. director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, cautioned the
Senate that \"the financial crisis and global recession are likely to
produce a wave of economic crises in emerging-market nations over the
next year.\" Hillary Clinton endorsed this grim view. And she was hardly
alone. Foreign Policy ran a cover story predicting serious unrest in
several emerging markets. Of one thing everyone was sure: nothing would
ever be the same again. Not the financial industry, not capitalism, not
globalization. [[One year later]{.mark}, how much has the world really
changed?]{.underline} Well, Wall Street is home to two fewer investment
banks (three, if you count Merrill Lynch). Some regional banks have gone
bust. There was some turmoil in Moldova and (entirely unrelated to the
financial crisis) in Iran. Severe problems remain, like high
unemployment in the West, and we face new problems caused by responses
to the crisis\--soaring debt and fears of inflation. But [overall,
[things look nothing like]{.mark} they did in [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[[30s]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The [predictions of
economic]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[and political [collapse have not
materialized at all]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A key measure]{.underline} of
fear and fragility [is the ability of poor]{.underline} and unstable
[countries to borrow money]{.underline} on the debt markets. [So
consider this: the]{.underline} sovereign [bonds of]{.underline}
tottering [Pakistan]{.underline} [have returned 168 percent]{.underline}
so far [this year]{.underline}. All [this]{.underline} doesn\'t add up
to a recovery yet, but it [does reflect a return to]{.underline} some
level of [normalcy]{.underline}. And [that rebound has been]{.underline}
so [rapid]{.underline} that even the shrewdest observers remain puzzled.
\"The question I have at the back of my head is \'Is that it?\' \" says
Charles Kaye, the co-head of Warburg Pincus. \"We had this huge crisis,
and now we\'re back to business as usual?\" This revival did not happen
because markets managed to stabilize themselves on their own. Rather,
[[governments,]{.mark} having learned the lessons of the Great
Depression, were determined not to repeat the same mistakes]{.underline}
once this crisis hit. [[By massively expanding]{.mark} state
[support]{.mark}]{.underline} for the economy\--[[through central banks
and]{.mark} national [treasuries]{.mark}\--they [buffered the
worst]{.mark} of the [damage]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Whether they made
new mistakes in the process remains to be seen.) The [[extensive social
safety nets]{.underline}]{.mark} that have been established across the
industrialized world also [[cushioned the pain]{.underline}]{.mark} felt
by many. [Times are]{.underline} still [tough, but things are nowhere
near as bad as in the]{.underline} 19[30s]{.underline}, when governments
played a tiny role in national economies. It\'s true that the massive
state interventions of the past year may be fueling some new bubbles:
the cheap cash and government guarantees provided to banks, companies,
and consumers have fueled some irrational exuberance in stock and bond
markets. Yet these [rallies]{.underline} also [demonstrate the return of
confidence, and confidence is a very powerful economic
force]{.underline}. When John Maynard Keynes described his own
prescriptions for economic growth, he believed government action could
provide only a temporary fix until the real motor of the economy started
cranking again\--the animal spirits of investors, consumers, and
companies seeking risk and profit. Beyond all this, though, I believe
ther[e\'s a fundamental reason why we have not faced global collapse in
the last year]{.underline}. [It is the same reason that [we weathered
the stock-market crash of]{.mark}]{.underline} 19[[87]{.underline}, [the
recession of]{.underline}]{.mark} 19[[92]{.underline}, [the Asian crisis
of]{.underline}]{.mark} 19[[97]{.underline}, [the Russian default
of]{.underline}]{.mark} 19[[98]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline}
[tech-bubble collapse of]{.underline}]{.mark} 20[[00]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline}]{.mark} current [[global economic system is
inherently]{.mark} more [resilient]{.mark} than we think.
The]{.underline} [world today is [characterized by]{.mark}]{.underline}
three [[major forces for stability, each reinforcing the
other]{.underline}]{.mark} and each historical in nature.

#### Sales to Mexico are key to the U.S. gun industry

TIM **DICKINSON '13.**, FEBRUARY 28, 2013. "The Gun Industry's Deadly
Addiction,"
https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-gun-industrys-deadly-addiction-99443/

[[The gun industry's **dirtiest**]{.mark} **-- and most [open -- secret
is that it is profiting from the sale of guns]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that are illegally trafficked in[[to Mexico]{.mark} to arm the drug
cartels responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.
"**[Nobody has a clue how big that market is]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
says Diaz. "[It's like drugs in reverse]{.underline}." "Military-style
weapons are arming Mexico's brutal drug trafficking organizations at an
alarming rate," Dianne Feinstein wrote in a 2011 letter to her Senate
colleagues. [[Nearly 90 percent of weapons seized in Mexico are]{.mark}
trafficked [from the U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Many of these firearms
came from gun shops and gun shows in Southwest border states," the GAO
reported, decrying the "increasingly lethal weapons," specifically
"high-caliber and high-powered" guns such as "AR-15-type semiautomatic
rifles, which fire ammunition that can pierce armor often used by
Mexican police." For the industry itself, the violent deaths of tens of
thousands of Mexicans are of no greater concern than the mock executions
of zombie dummies. In 2005, Congress granted gunmakers and gun dealers
blanket immunity from civil damages resulting from the misuse of their
products. The National Shooting Sports Federation has even gone to court
attempting to block modest ATF efforts to track sales of assault rifles.
In January 2012, a federal judge dismissed the industry's complaint --
leading the NRA to grumble that this was just "more proof that the Obama
administration is intent on blaming gun owners and the Second Amendment
for a problem that is rooted in Mexico." The industry is also fueling
violence closer to home. [[**Gunmakers reap money** from]{.mark} a
[shadowy]{.mark} network of [gun dealers]{.mark}]{.underline} that
supply weapons to criminals and gangs that terrorize our neighborhoods
and kill cops. An ATF report found that nearly 58 percent of crime guns
traced in 1998 had been sold by just 1.2 percent of gun dealers. Thanks
to the NRA and Congress, ATF is now prohibited from publishing such
data.

Firearms & Ammunition Industry is an Important Part of America's Economy
Companies in the United States that manufacture, distribute, and sell

people in the country and generate an additional 162,845 jobs in
supplier and ancillary industries. These include jobs in supplying goods
and services to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, and those
that depend on sales to workers in the firearms and ammunition
industry.1 These are good jobs paying an average of \$50,400 in wages
and benefits. And today, every job is important. The United States
currently has an unemployment rate of 3.77 percent. This means that
there are already 6,132,000 people trying to find jobs in the nation and

#### Economic slowdown risks diversionary war.

**Foster '16** \-- Dennis Foster, professor of international studies and
political science at the Virginia Military Institute, "Would President
Trump go to war to divert attention from problems at home?", Washington
Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/19/yes-trump-might-well-go-to-war-to-divert-attention-from-problems-at-home/?utm_term=.43745ac4c66c>

[[If the U.S. economy tanks]{.underline}]{.mark}, [should we
[expect]{.mark} Donald [Trump to]{.mark} engage in a diversionary war?
Since the age of Machiavelli, analysts have expected world leaders to
**[launch international conflicts to deflect popular attention]{.mark}**
away from problems at home. By stirring up feelings of patriotism,
leaders might escape the political costs of scandal, unpopularity --- or
a poorly performing economy]{.underline}. [One often-cited example of
diversionary war in modern times is Argentina's 1982 invasion of the
Falklands]{.underline}, which several (though not all) political
scientists attribute to the junta's desire to divert the people's
attention from a disastrous economy. In a 2014 article, Jonathan Keller
and I argued that whether [[U.S. presidents engage in diversionary
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} depends in part on their psychological
traits --- how they frame the world, process information and develop
plans of action. Certain traits predispose leaders to more belligerent
behavior. Do words translate into foreign policy action? One way to
identify these traits is content analyses of leaders' rhetoric. The more
leaders use certain types of verbal constructs, the more likely they are
to possess traits that lead them to use military force. For one,
conceptually simplistic leaders view the world in "black and white"
terms; they develop unsophisticated solutions to problems and are
largely insensitive to risks. Similarly, distrustful leaders tend to
exaggerate threats and rely on aggression to deal with threats.
Distrustful leaders typically favor military action and are confident in
their ability to wield it effectively. Thus, when faced with politically
damaging problems that are hard to solve --- such as a faltering economy
--- leaders who are both distrustful and simplistic are less likely to
put together complex, direct responses. Instead, they develop simplistic
but risky "solutions" that divert popular attention from the problem,
utilizing the tools with which they are most comfortable and confident
(military force). Based on our analysis of the rhetoric of previous U.S.
presidents, we found that presidents whose language appeared more
simplistic and distrustful, such as Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and
George W. Bush, were more likely to use force abroad in times of rising
inflation and unemployment. By contrast, John F. Kennedy and Bill
Clinton, whose rhetoric pegged them as more complex and trusting, were
less likely to do so. What about Donald Trump? Since Donald Trump's
election, many commentators have expressed concern about how he will
react to new challenges and whether he might make quick recourse to
military action. For example, the Guardian's George Monbiot has argued
that political realities will stymie Trump's agenda, especially his
promises regarding the economy. Then, [[rather than]{.mark} risk

[This report details the significant economic impact the firearms and
ammunition industry has on the nation's and each state's economy. The
economic growth America's firearms and ammunition industry has
experienced in recent years has been nothing short of
remarkable]{.underline}. Over the past decade, the industry's growth has
been driven by an unprecedented number of Americans choosing to exercise
their fundamental right to keep and bear arms and purchase a firearm and
ammunition. NSSF, representing America's firearms and ammunition
manufacturers, takes great pride in supporting wildlife conservation
efforts. Noted in the economic impact report is the significant taxes
paid by our industry to federal and state governments and the
Pittman-Robertson excise tax the industry pays on the products it sells
-- this tax is the major source of wildlife conservation funding in
America. [Regardless of economic conditions across the country, our
industry has grown and created about 146,000 new, well-paying jobs over
the past decade. Our industry is proud to be one of the bright spots in
this economy]{.underline}.

Bill Dietrick, observing from a long career serving his country and the

driven from their home states by insane feel-good laws being promoted at
the state house level: [Something to keep in mind in regards to firearms
manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, etc. moving their
operations: the economic loss to the state is far greater than those

negotiating to move out of New York, with five other states, as a result
of Cuomo's ill-considered ramming through of his new idiot bills.
Remington is the economic mainstay business of Ilion, New York. True,
they'd perhaps directly lose perhaps 2,500 jobs, but consider how many
other people depend on those jobs for their livelihood. If those folks
move, [there goes the income for the firefighters and cops (not as many
needed), the real estate agents, the car dealers, the grocers, the
clothiers, etc]{.underline}. etc. Ilion will become a ghost town. All
directly attributable to Cuomo's self-aggrandizing posturing. The
[losses will be monstrous]{.underline}. Mag-Pul and its subsidiary
suppliers may actually only move 800 jobs directly out of Colorado, but
figure, at minimum, double that in lost jobs. Then, how about the loss
to the state in the form of property tax, sales tax, vehicle tax,
gasoline tax, etc? These politicians think Mag-Pul is bluffing. I assure
you they are not. Neither are Remington, Beretta, etc. They may piss off
their constituents to the point we'll not see another Democrat majority
for decades, which wouldn't hurt my feelings at all.

### Guns industry -- Econ impacts

#### Trump's diversionary wars go nuclear and involve other major powers

Tim **Street '16**, Senior Programme Officer on the Sustainable Security
programme at ORG and has worked for many years on the politics of
nuclear disarmament and the arms trade, 11-30-2016, \"President Trump:
Successor to the Nuclear Throne,\" No Publication,
<http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/publications/briefing_papers_and_reports/president_trump_successor_nuclear_throne>

Donald Trump's arrival in the White House as US President has deeply
unnerved people from across the political spectrum, both inside the US
and around the world. The fact that many regard Trump as an indecent
individual and his government as potentially the number one threat to
their dignity, liberty and life means that the civil strife already
raging in the US is unlikely to fade away soon. [The wide-ranging
implications of Trump's election to the most powerful office on
Earth---for the peace and stability of both that nation and the
world---cannot be emphasised enough. In this regard, [of the]{.mark}
many uncertainties and [worries brought on by]{.mark} a [Trump]{.mark}
presidency, the two [**existential questions** of]{.mark} climate change
and **[nuclear war stand out]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With the former,
Trump's recent comment that he now has an 'open mind' about the
importance of the Paris climate agreement---having previously said
climate change is a 'hoax'---is unlikely to assuage fears that he will
seek to dramatically expand the US's extraction and reliance on fossil
fuels. With the latter, strong doubts have been raised over whether the
new President is capable of responsibly handling the incredible power
that will be at his fingertips. Moreover, several [commentators are
already raising concerns that a [Trump]{.mark} administration [will
pursue]{.mark} policies that will aggravate and disappoint his
supporters, a situation that could increase the possibility of the US
engaging in a '**[diversionary' war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In order to
consider what we can expect from a Trump presidency, as well as noting
whom Trump empowers as members of his cabinet and those whom he draws on
for advice, it is vital to study the track record of recent
administrations and appreciate the powers Trump will inherit. In doing
so this briefing focuses on the question of what a Trump presidency
might mean for international relations with a focus on nuclear arms,
including doctrine and disarmament. This means reviewing policies
relevant to the US's nuclear arsenal and pressing international
challenges such as non-proliferation, including in East Asia and the
Middle East, as well as the US's relationship with Russia and its role
in NATO. The power and responsibilities of the nuclear monarch The US
President is solely responsible for the decision to use the
near-unimaginably destructive power of the nation's nuclear arsenal.
Thus, as Bruce Blair---a former intercontinental ballistic missile
launch control officer---makes clear, 'Trump will have the sole
authority to launch nuclear weapons whenever he chooses with a single
phone call.' The wider political meaning of the bomb for the world is
aptly summarised by Daniel Deudney, who describes nuclear weapons as
'intrinsically despotic' so that they have created 'nuclear monarchies'
in all nuclear-armed states. Deudney identifies three related reasons
for this development: 'the speed of nuclear use decisions; the
concentration of nuclear use decision into the hands of one individual;
and the lack of accountability stemming from the inability of affected
groups to have their interests represented at the moment of nuclear
use'. Similarly, Elaine Scarry has explained in stark terms in her 2014
book Thermonuclear Monarchy: Choosing between Democracy and Doom, how
the possession of nuclear weapons has converted the US government into
'a monarchic form of rule that places all defense in the executive
branch of government' leaving the population 'incapacitated'. In
response to this situation, Scarry argues that the American people must
use the Constitution as a tool to dismantle the US nuclear weapons
system, thereby revitalising democratic participation and control over
decision-making. Scarry also outlines the incredible might the president
wields, with each of the US's fourteen nuclear-armed submarines alone
carrying 'enough power to destroy the people of an entire continent',
equivalent to 'eight times the full-blast power expended by Allied and
Axis countries in World War II'. Nuclear specialist Hans Kristensen has
described how [the US's strategic nuclear war plan 'if unleashed in its
full capacity' could 'kill hundreds of millions of people, devastate
entire nations, and cause climatic effects on a global
scale']{.underline}. This war plan consists of a 'family of plans' that
is aimed at 'six potential adversaries' whose identities are kept
secret. Kristensen understands that they include 'potentially hostile
countries with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons (WMD)', meaning
China, North Korea, Iran, Russia and Syria as well as a terrorist group
backed by a state that has conducted a catastrophic WMD attack. The
'dominant mission' for US nuclear weapons within these plans is termed
counterforce, meaning strikes on 'military, mostly nuclear, targets and
the enemy's leadership'. Despite these plans, the US's nuclear arsenal
is often described by mainstream commentators as being solely intended
to ensure mutual assured destruction (MAD), i.e. as part of the 'balance
of terror' with Russia, in order to prevent armed conflict between the
two nations and to ensure a response in kind to a surprise nuclear
attack. However, as Joseph Gerson and John Feffer explain, rather than
deterrence just being about enough nuclear forces surviving a surprise
first strike attack to ensure MAD, US military planners have also
understood it to mean 'preventing other nations from taking "courses of
action" that are inimical to US interests'. David McDonough thus
describes the 'long-standing goal of American nuclear war-planners' as
being the achievement of the ability to launch a disarming first-strike
against an opponent- otherwise known as nuclear superiority. This has
been magnified in recent years as the US seeks to 'prevent' or
'rollback' the ability of weaker states---both nuclear and non-nuclear
powers---to establish or maintain a deterrence relationship. Taking all
this into account, the new commander-in-chief's apparently volatile
temperament thus raises deep concerns since his finger will be on the
nuclear trigger as soon as he assumes office on 20th January 2017. Given
his past experience, Bruce Blair's statement that he is 'scared to
death' by the idea of a Trump presidency is but one further reason why
urgent discussion and action, both in the US and globally, on lessening
nuclear dangers---and reviving disarmament---is vital. A recent report
by the Ploughshares Fund on how the US can reduce its nuclear spending,
reform its nuclear posture and restrain its nuclear war plans should
thus be required reading in Washington. However, as the Economist has
rightly noted, 'It is not Mr Trump's fault that the system, in which the
vulnerable land-based missile force is kept on hair-trigger alert, is
widely held to be inherently dangerous' since, as they point out, 'no
former president, including Barack Obama, has done anything to change
it.' Over sixty years after the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, nuclearism thus remains very much embedded in the nation's
strategic thinking. Yet the election of Obama, and the rhetoric of his
2009 Prague speech, in which he stated 'America\'s commitment to seek
the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons' led many to
think that a real change was on the cards. Obama's visit to Hiroshima
earlier this year to commemorate the bombings was thus a painful
reminder of how wide the gap is between the rearmament programmes that
the US and other nuclear weapon states are engaged in and the
disarmament action that they are legally obliged to pursue under the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Obama himself said in Japan
that, 'technological progress without an equivalent progress in human
institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution that led to the
splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.' For this
statement to be meaningful it is necessary to identify who is
responsible for the existing, highly dangerous state of affairs. In
short, the US government's recent record supports Scarry's suggestion
that a democratic revolution is what, in reality, is most needed if the
US is to make substantial progress on nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament. Short-term reforms towards the democratic control and
ultimate dismantlement of the US's nuclear arsenal have been outlined by
Kennette Benedict, who writes that the next administration should: place
our nuclear weapons on a much lower level of launch readiness, release
to the public more information about the nuclear weapons in our own
arsenals, include legislators and outside experts in its nuclear posture
review and recognize Congress' authority to declare war as a
prerequisite to any use of nuclear weapons. Assessing Obama's nuclear
legacy In order to properly appreciate what a Trump presidency may
bring, we need to revisit the range and types of powers bequeathed to
the commander-in-chief by previous administrations. Despite the military
advances made by China and Russia in recent years, it is important to
recognise that the US remains far and away the biggest global spender on
conventional and nuclear weapons and plans to consolidate this position
by maintaining significant technological superiority over its
adversaries, which will, as is well appreciated, push Beijing,
Moscow---and thus other regional powers---to respond. Yet spending on
nuclear weapons alone is set to pose significant budgeting difficulties
for future US governments. According to a 2014 report by the James
Martin Center, the Departments of Defense and Energy plan to spend
approximately \$1 trillion over the next 30 years 'to maintain its
current nuclear arsenal and procure a new generation of nuclear-armed or
nuclear capable bombers and submarines' as well as new submarine
launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and inter-continental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs). Arms Control Today has found that total Defense
Department nuclear spending 'is projected to average more than \$40
billion in constant fiscal year 2016 dollars between 2025 and 2035, when
modernization costs are expected to peak'. Including costs for the
Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration's
projected weapons-related spending during this period 'would push
average spending during this period to more than \$50 billion per year'.
If anywhere near these sums are spent, then the modest reductions to the
US's nuclear stockpile achieved during the Obama presidency will be
entirely overshadowed. Moreover, as analyst Andrew Lichterman notes, the
US's continued modernisation of its nuclear forces is 'inherently
incompatible' with the 'unequivocal undertaking' given at the 2000 NPT
Review Conference to eliminate its nuclear arsenal and apply the
'principle of irreversibility' to this and related actions. For
Lichterman, the huge outlays committed to the nuclear weapons complex
were part of a political 'bargain' made by the Obama administration with
Republicans. This ensured that the New START nuclear arms control treaty
would pass in the Senate whilst also not disturbing the development of
missile defense and other advanced conventional weapons programmes. New
START is a bilateral agreement between Russia and the US, which Steven
Pifer describes as 'one of the few bright spots' that exists in these
nations' relationship. Under the treaty Moscow and Washington must, by
2018, reduce their stockpile of operationally deployed strategic nuclear
warheads to 1,550. Furthermore, both must keep to a limit of 700
deployed strategic launchers (missiles) and heavy bombers, and to a
combined limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers and
heavy bombers. Despite New START 'proceeding smoothly' according to
Pifer, Hans Kristensen recently produced a report comparing Obama's
record with that of the previous presidents holding office during the
nuclear age, which found that, hitherto, Obama has cut fewer
warheads---in terms of numbers rather than percentages---than 'any
administration ever' and that 'the biggest nuclear disarmers' in recent
decades have been Republicans, not Democrats. Kristensen thus drily
observes of this situation that, a conservative Congress does not
complain when Republican presidents reduce the stockpile, only when
Democratic president try to do so. As a result of the opposition, the
United States is now stuck with a larger and more expensive nuclear
arsenal than had Congress agreed to significant reductions. As his
presidency draws to a close, presumably as a means of securing some sort
of meaningful legacy in this area, it has been reported that Obama
considered adopting a no first use (NFU) policy for nuclear weapons,
something which, whilst reversible, could act as a restraint on future
presidents. Yet this was apparently abandoned, according to the New York
Times, after 'top national security advisers argued that it could
undermine allies and embolden Russia and China'. Furthermore, according
to Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, the governments of Japan, South
Korea, France and Britain all privately communicated their concerns
about Washington adopting NFU. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is also
said to have argued that such a move would be unwise because 'if North
Korea used biological weapons against the South the United States might
need the option of threatening a nuclear response'. However, as Daryll
Kimball explains, the US's 'overwhelming' conventional military
advantage means that 'there is no plausible circumstance that could
justify---legally, morally, or militarily---the use of nuclear weapons
to deal with a non-nuclear threat'. Such resistance to NFU is thus
deeply disappointing given that, as Kimball goes on to note, this move
would go some way to reassuring China and Russia about the US's
strategic intentions. It would also be an important confidence-building
measure for the wider community of non-nuclear weapon states, showing
that the US is willing to act in \'good faith\' towards its disarmament
obligations under the NPT. Thinking about the causes of proliferation
more widely requires us to understand what drives weaker states to seek
deterrents, if their reliance on them is to be reduced. For example, as
Dr Alan J. Kuperman observes, NATO's bombing and overthrow of Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 'greatly complicated the task of
persuading other states such as Iran and North Korea 'to halt or reverse
their nuclear programs'. The lesson Tehran and Pyongyang took is thus
that because Gaddafi had voluntarily ended his nuclear and chemical
weapons programmes, the West now felt free to pursue regime change. When
assessing the importance of the Iran nuclear deal, which is often hailed
as one of Obama's landmark achievements, and which the next President
must not be allowed to derail, it is thus important also to consider
carefully what behaviour by the most powerful states will enable
existing or potential nuclear possessors to embrace disarmament and
reduce their interest in seeking non-conventional deterrents. The
inability of Washington to make substantial progress towards reducing
the salience of nuclear weapons at home and abroad is all the more
noteworthy when one considers the state of US and Russian public opinion
on nuclear arms control and disarmament. As John Steinbrunner and Nancy
Gallagher observe, 'responses to detailed questions reveal a striking
disparity between what U.S. and Russian leaders are doing and what their
publics desire'. For example, their polling found that: At the most
fundamental level, the vast majority of Americans and Russians think
that nuclear weapons have a very limited role in current security
circumstances and believe that their only legitimate purpose is to deter
nuclear attack. It is highly consistent, then, that the publics in both
countries would favor eliminating all nuclear weapons if this action
could be taken under effective international verification. Another
important measure which the US has failed to hitherto ratify is the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This is despite President Obama
stating in 2009 that he intended to pursue Senate ratification of the
treaty 'immediately and aggressively'. Once more, there is notably
strong public support--82% according to a 2010 poll by the Chicago
Council on Global Affairs---for the US joining the CTBT but, again, the
Republican-controlled Senate has blocked the treaty at every
opportunity. Overall, the gap between the public's will and the
government's inaction on nuclear issues is alarming and redolent of the
wider democratic deficit in the US. On a more positive note, the fact
that the citizenry supports such measures suggests that groups
advocating arms control and disarmament initiatives should continue to
engage with and understand the public's positions in order to
effectively harness their support. Stepping back from the brink In terms
of priorities for the incoming administration in the US, stepping back
from military confrontation with Russia and pushing the threat of
nuclear war to the margins must be at the top of the list. Whilst much
has been made of a potential rapprochement between Trump and Putin, the
two have, reportedly, only just spoken for the first time on the phone
and still need to actually meet in person to discuss strategic issues
and deal with inevitable international events and crises, including in
relation to Ukraine and Syria. As of now, whilst the mood music from
both sides might suggest a warming of relations, as has been seen with
previous administrations, unless cooperation is rooted in a real
willingness to resolve problems (which for Russia includes US ballistic
missile defense deployments in Eastern Europe and NATO expansion) then
tensions can quickly re-emerge. Another related question concerns how
Trump will conduct himself during any potential crisis or conflict with
Russia or another major power, given the stakes and risks involved, as
highlighted above. Whilst we must wait to find out precisely what the
new administration's approach to international affairs will be, in the
past week, NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that
he had been personally informed by Donald Trump, following the election,
that the US remains 'strongly committed to NATO, and that the security
guarantees to Europe stand'. Trump had previously shaken sections of the
defence and foreign policy establishment by suggesting that NATO was
'obsolete' and that countries such as Japan (and by extension others
such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia) 'have to pay us or we have to let
them protect themselves', which could include them acquiring the bomb.
One reason why some in Washington have, in the past, not wanted their
regional allies to develop their own nuclear weapons is because the US
might then become dragged into an escalating conflict. Moreover, if an
ally in one region seeks the bomb, this may cause others elsewhere to
pursue their own capabilities- an act of strategic independence that
might make these states harder to influence and control. The US's key
relationships in East Asia and the Middle East illustrate why, if a
future US President wishes to take meaningful moves towards a world free
of nuclear weapons, then developing alternative regional political
agreements, including strategic cooperation with China and Russia, will
be necessary. As Nancy Gallagher rightly notes, the 'weaknesses of
existing international organizations' thus requires 'more inclusive,
cooperative security institutions' to be constructed regionally 'to
complement and someday, perhaps, to replace exclusive military
alliances', alongside progressive demilitarisation. Such
confidence-building measures would also support efforts to halt missile
and nuclear tests by states such as North Korea, which may soon be
capable of striking the US mainland. Imagining the next enemy As well as
mapping out the US's current nuclear weapons policies and its regional
relationships, it is important to reflect upon how domestic political
dynamics under a Trump presidency might drive Washington's behaviour
internationally, particularly given the nuclear shadow that always hangs
over conflicts involving the US. For example, in the near-term, Trump's
economic plan and the great expectations amongst the American working
class that have been generated, may have particularly dangerous
consequences if, as seems likely, the primary beneficiaries are the very
wealthy. Reviewing Trump's economic plans, Martin Wolf of the Financial
Times concludes that 'the longer-term consequences are likely to be
grim, not least for his angry, but fooled, supporters. Next time, they
might be even angrier. Where that might lead is terrifying'. Gillian
Tett has also highlighted the 'real risks' that Trump's policies could
'spark US social unrest or geopolitical uncertainty'. Elsewhere, George
Monbiot in the Guardian, makes the stark assertion that the inability of
the US and other governments to respond effectively to public anger
means he now believes that '**[[we will see war between the major
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** within my lifetime'. If these warnings
weren't troubling enough, no less a figure than Henry Kissinger argued
on BBC's Newsnight that 'the more likely reaction' to a Trump presidency
from terror groups 'will be to do something that evokes a reaction' from
Washington in order to 'widen the split' between it and Europe and
damage the US's image around the world. Given that Trump has already
vowed to 'bomb the shit out of ISIS' and refused to rule out the use of
nuclear weapons against the group, it goes without saying that such a
scenario could have the gravest consequences and must be avoided so that
the US does not play into the terrorists' hands. Looking more widely,
President-elect Trump's existing and potential cabinet appointments,
which Glenn Greenwald has summarised as 'empowering...by and large...the
traditional, hard, hawkish right-wing members of the Republican Party'
also point to the US engaging in future overseas conflicts, rather than
the isolationism which many in the foreign policy establishment
criticised Trump for proposing during the presidential campaign. William
Hartung and Todd Harrison have drawn attention to the fact that defence
spending under Trump could be almost \$1trillion (spread over ten years)
more than Obama's most recent budget request. Such projections,
alongside Trump's election rhetoric, suggest that the new nuclear
monarch will try to push wide open the door to more spending on nuclear
weapons and missile defense, a situation made possible, as we have seen,
by Obama's inability to implement progressive change in this area at a
time of persistent Republican obstruction. Conclusion The problem now,
for the US and the world, is that if Trump does make good on his
campaign promises then this will have several damaging consequences for
international peace and security and that if Trump does not sufficiently
satisfy his supporters then this will likely pour fuel on the flames at
home, which may then quickly spread abroad. The people of the US and the
world thus now have a huge responsibility to act as a restraining
influence and ensure that the US retains an accountable, transparent and
democratic government. This responsibility will only grow if crises or
shocks take place in or outside the US which ambitious and extremist
figures take advantage of, framing them as threats to national security
in order to protect their interests and power. If such scenarios emerge
the next administration and its untried and untested President will find
themselves with a range of extremely powerful tools and institutional
experience at their disposal, including [[nuclear weapons]{.mark}, which
[may prove too tempting to resist]{.mark}]{.underline} when figuring out
how to respond to widespread anger, confusion and unrest, both at home
and abroad.

### A2 Gun industry isn't big enough

#### Even if the gun industry isn't key, ripple effects will drag down the economy

https://www.nationalreview.com/2013/02/why-do-democrats-hate-american-manufacturers-michelle-malkin/

Here's the latest example of head-splitting cognitive dissonance in
Washington: President Obama used his State of the Union address to
crusade for a revitalized U.S. manufacturing sector. But while he pays
lip service to supporting businesses that build their products on
American soil, Obama and his left-wing operatives are hell-bent on
driving [[a **key sector** of the U.S. manufacturing
industry]{.underline}]{.mark} six feet under: [the]{.underline}
**[[American firearms]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and ammunition
industry]{.underline}. In my adopted home state of Colorado, where
unemployment hovers near 8 percent, nearly a dozen businesses are being
forced to consider leaving their home state because of extremist
gun-control proposals. Vice President Joe Biden himself leaned on
Democratic lawmakers to support an arbitrary 15-round limit on
ammunition magazines. So, what have Sheriff Joe and his gun-grabbing
pals wrought? Denver-based ammo magazine manufacturer Magpul served
notice that it will take its 400 full-time employees and subcontractors
somewhere else. Magpul generates some \$85 million in spending in the
state. As the Denver Post reported, the privately held company makes an
array of consumer products in addition to sales to the military, law
enforcement, and gun owners. And because Magpul has made a conscientious
effort to support other Colorado companies, [[**the ripple effect could
reach far beyond the gun industry** --- including]{.mark} several
[cutting-edge innovators in]{.mark} the
[plastics]{.mark}-injection-molding business]{.underline}. One of
Magpul's most [[important contractors]{.underline}]{.mark}, Denver-based
Alfred Manufacturing Co., employs 150 residents. It, too, [[will
"relocate]{.underline}]{.mark} part or all of our operations out of
state" if Democrat governor John Hickenlooper enacts the stringent
gun-control regime pushed by Biden and company. The company has already
put expansion plans on hold.

### CP idea -- Gun tracking

#### The United States Federal Government should use the end-use monitoring program to track and register American weapons to Mexico, enforce the Leahy Laws regarding future arms sales to Mexico, and create an internationally backed truth commission. 

#### CP Solves -- the U.S. has sufficient leverage -- solves current arms in the area

Instead of loosening regulations on these arms sales, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark} begin [track]{.mark}ing
[and]{.mark} [register]{.mark}ing [the weapons that American companies
sell]{.mark} to foreign security forces.]{.underline} [[Washington
should]{.mark} also [begin using]{.mark} an already existing tool: [the
Leahy Laws]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} laws [ban]{.mark} [the
U.S.]{.mark} government [from assisting units of foreign security forces
when there is "credible evidence" that they have committed
torture]{.mark}, extrajudicial [killings, or rape]{.mark}. But they have
been loosely enforced]{.underline}. From 2010 to 2016, [as members
of]{.underline} [Mexico's security forces worked with organized criminal
groups to torture and execute innocent people]{.underline}, [the State
Department approved the sale of 6,622 long guns and 4,571 handguns to
the Mexican army alone.]{.underline} The [incoming [president]{.mark} of
Mexico, Andrés Manuel López [Obrador]{.mark}, has pledged to change the
"failed" security policies of his predecessors]{.underline}. [He's
[called for UN help to stop corruption and]{.mark} promised to [allow an
internationally backed truth commission]{.mark}]{.underline} to
investigate the disappearance of the 43 students. Considering that the
previous Mexican administration covered up brutal murders, this is a
step in the right direction. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has]{.mark} [more leverage]{.mark} in this situation]{.underline} than
you might think. Though Mexico could buy guns elsewhere, [no other
country can match the United States as a strategic partner]{.underline}.
[Mexico has received more than \$1.3 billion in American training and
equipment since 2012]{.underline}, and [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [wields significant influence because of
this]{.underline}. [[Backing]{.mark} López [Obrador's security reforms
would send a signal that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is getting
more serious about human rights]{.mark} in Mexico]{.underline}. By
arming violent and corrupt organizations across the southern border and
beyond, America is undermining its own interests and security.
[[Congress has]{.mark} both [the power to demand more
info]{.mark}rmation about American arms sales to Mexico]{.underline} and
the ability to block the Trump administration's efforts to loosen
safeguards. [U.S. security and thousands of Mexican lives are at
stake.]{.underline}

#### The U.S. needs to increase controls on licensing on arms contracts to Mexico to prevent robbery and human rights violations.

[[Mexico]{.mark}]{.underline} has actively [[participated in
international]{.underline}]{.mark} fora related to [[controls
on]{.mark}]{.underline} conventional, nuclear, chemical, and biological
[[weapons as well as landmines and cluster bombs]{.underline}]{.mark},
both in the regional system and globally.79 One of the aims of the Arms
Trade Treaty (att) is to regulate and make transparent international
transfers of firearms with the goals of prohibiting the sales of arms if
the exporting country has knowledge that the weapons would be used in
war crimes, crimes against humanity, and human rights violations.80 The
United States has signed but not ratified the treaty.

Although the att allows each State Party to determine how it will
organize its national system to prevent the diversion of conventional
arms, it highlights the importance of national control mechanisms for
the effective and transparent regulation of firearm transfers. Mexico
thus has an obligation to keep a national registry of firearms
transferred for end use in the country.

The issue of transparency is also relevant in the context of violence
which confronts nations such as Mexico. We can assume that illegal
weapons transfers are one of the causes of violence in Mexico, but
[[weapons legally transferred to Mexico are]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[involved particularly given the lack of clarity
about]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[end users.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In this context, [[it is critical that the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline} as the largest exporter of firearms to the
Mexican government [[proactively strengthen transparency and improve
systems for recording, monitoring and controlling the markets and flow
of firearms]{.underline}]{.mark} in both countries. [[The United States
can]{.mark}]{.underline} take these steps [[even without ratifying the
at]{.underline}]{.mark}t.

At the same time, Mexico's Internal Security Law, ratified in December
2017, allows the military to conduct law enforcement activities which do
not correspond to their mission and training, and with no controls that
would prevent or investigate human rights violations. If the Internal
Security Law continues in force, it is likely that the Mexican
military's activities will become even less transparent, based on the
argument that the disclosure of information related to the manufacture,
imports, transfers, and sale of weapons would represent a risk to
national security. There is no evidence to support this argument.81
Efforts to promote more effective systems for [[registering and tracing
weapons sold by the military are key to preventing]{.underline}]{.mark}
their [[use in]{.underline}]{.mark} serious [[crimes and human rights
violations.]{.underline}]{.mark} But reduced transparency will make such
efforts more dif cult.82

[[It is critical to end the inadequate controls on the issuing of
licenses for firearms exports]{.underline}]{.mark}. On one hand, the
United States is seeking to expand its weapons market by transferring
responsibility for such licenses to the Commerce Department. On the
other hand, [[Mexico has a serious problem of weapons diversion and
misuse]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which could be addressed
by]{.mark}]{.underline} means of effective [[oversight of both legal
arms flows and of end users of those arms]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Therefore, [[the United States should monitor the contexts of violence
in]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons-importing countries and, in the case of
[[Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[prohibit the export of weapons to law
enforcement agencies of]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[Mexican states
that]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[committed]{.underline}]{.mark} serious
[[human rights violations]{.underline}]{.mark}. End [[users
that]{.underline}]{.mark} frequently [[lose weapons,
alleging]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[they have been robbed,
should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be excluded from u.s. arms exports,
unless investigations determine who was responsible for the weapons'
disappearance and]{.underline}]{.mark} they are [[held
accountable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### CP idea -- Domestic gun control

#### Domestic Laws CP solves

**Eby, UCLA JD Candidate, 14** (Jessica, 2014, UCLA Law Review, "Fast
and Furious, or Slow and Steady? The Flow of Guns From the United States
to Mexico", Vol. 61, Issue 4, p. 52-53, RR)

51-52

When distance from Mexico was included as a control in the regression
model, the individual gun control laws examined---(1) [[limiting
multiple sales]{.underline}]{.mark}, (2) [[requiring background checks
for secondary transfers]{.underline}]{.mark}, (3) [[prosecution straw
purchasers, and]{.underline}]{.mark} (4) [[restricting]{.mark} the sale
of [assault weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---[was [associated with a
reduction in]{.mark} a [state's crime gun rate to
Mexico]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[States without]{.mark} multiple sales
restrictions [exported crime guns]{.mark} to Mexico [at]{.mark} a [rate
291]{.mark} percent [greater]{.mark} than states that do]{.underline}
restrict multiple sales; [states without background check]{.underline}
requirements on secondary transfers [exported]{.underline} [crime guns
at a rate 195]{.underline} percent [greater than states that
do]{.underline} require background checks; [states that allow for
prosecution of straw purchasers export crime guns at a rate
227]{.underline} percent [greater than states that do not]{.underline};
[and states that do not restrict the sale of assault weapons exported
crime guns at a rate 210 percent greater than states that
do]{.underline}. When both distance from the border with Mexico and gun
prevalence within the state were included in the regression model,
however, there was no longer a detectable relationship between state gun
control measures and crime gun export rates. The same is true for the
cumulative impact of having one, two, three, or four of these gun
control laws in place[: [States with incrementally]{.mark} [more gun
control laws had incrementally lower crime gun export rates than]{.mark}
did [states with no gun control]{.mark} laws,]{.underline} when
controlling for distance from the border with Mexico. The presence of
all four of these gun control laws was associated with a particularly
drastic reduction in the state's crime gun export rate to Mexico:
[[States that had none]{.mark} of these gun control laws [sourced 655
percent more crime guns to Mexico]{.mark} than states that had all four
of these gun control laws]{.underline}, even when controlling for
distance from the border. However, when distance from the border and a
measure of gun prevalence within the state were both included as control
variables, a relationship between the number of gun control laws and the
crime gun export rate was no longer detectable. The inability of this
study's model to measure the relationship between state crime gun export
rates and gun control laws when including a variable for gun prevalence
is likely due to the fact that gun prevalence and gun control laws are
negatively correlated with one another: States with fewer gun control
laws have more guns, and vice versa. Although this negative correlation
says nothing about the directionality of that relationship---whether a
lack of gun control laws leads to a high prevalence of guns, or whether
a high prevalence of guns prevents the passage of gun control laws,
either or both of which could plausibly be true---it does explain why a
standard regression equation may be unable to pick up the marginal
difference between the effects of gun control laws and gun prevalence on
crime gun export rates. CONCLUSION [Crime guns recovered and traced in
Mexico differ in three important ways from U.S. crime guns. First, a
small majority of crime guns recovered and traced in Mexico are long
guns, including rifles, shotguns, and machine guns]{.underline}. Second,
nearly 20 percent of crime guns recovered and traced in Mexico have a
time-to-crime of three years or less, yet the average age of crime guns
recovered and traced in [Mexico]{.underline} is older than in the United
States, [suggesting there are both very young and very old guns in the
sample]{.underline}. [Third, the most popular calibers, makes, and
models of crime guns recovered and traced in Mexico are AK-47 type
semiautomatic assault rifles and AR-15 type semiautomatic assault
rifles]{.underline}, despite the infrequence of these weapons as crime
guns in the United States. [The [presence of four state gun
control]{.mark} [measures]{.mark} in a state---(1) [limiting multiple
sales]{.mark}, (2) [requiring background checks for secondary
transfers]{.mark}, (3) [prosecuting straw purchasers, and]{.mark} (4)
[restricting]{.mark} the [sale of assault weapons]{.mark}---
significantly [reduces]{.mark} [the state's exports of crime
guns]{.mark} to Mexico compared to states that have none of these gun
control measures in place]{.underline}, when controlling for distance
from the border. These findings suggest [that [states in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates might [limit]{.mark} their [exports of
crime guns to Mexico if]{.mark} they [put in place]{.mark} these [four
gun control laws]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further research is needed to
determine if there are other gun control laws not analyzed herein that
are similarly correlated with a reduction in the rate of export of crime
guns to Mexico and if there are other ways to explain the relationships
amongst the variables observed herein. If the ATF were to release crime
gun trace data from Mexico in their raw form, it would facilitate even
more granular and sophisticated analysis of the characteristics of
Mexican crime guns sourced from the United States and their relationship
with state characteristics, such as gun control laws and gun prevalence.

#### Empirics prove banning assault weapons works

**Lindsay-Poland 18** \[John, 3/28/18, Coordinator of Stop US Arms to
Mexico, Al Jazeera, "America's Guns: Made in the US, killing in Mexico",

[[To reduce the flow of weaponry that feeds violence in Mexico requires
looking]{.mark} not only [at the]{.mark} border crossings themselves,
but [upstream]{.mark} - to [the production of and legal access to
weapons made for killing people. That is why it is important]{.mark} for
the US Congress - and failing that, southern border states - [to
prohibit assault weapons and high-capacity
magazines]{.mark}]{.underline}, and to make gun trafficking itself a
crime.

The problem is cultural and ethical, as well as one of policies and
laws. While hundreds of thousands of people in 800 cities and towns in
the US marched for legislation to prevent gun violence last Saturday,
gun company Sig Sauer was [showing small
children](https://www.facebook.com/SIGSAUERInc/photos/a.10156225741617603.1073741848.57629597602/10156228442887603/?type=3&theater) how
to shoot pistols and sniper rifles with silencers at the Game and Fish
Expo in Arizona - a state that is ground zero for the legal and illegal
export of guns to Mexico.

[The legal export of guns by US gun producers to Mexican police is also
feeding criminal activities and the illegal gun market in Mexico, in
several ways. The Mexican military is the only legal importer of
firearms in Mexico; in turn, it sells weapons to police throughout the
country, and, to a lesser extent, to private individuals and security
companies. ]{.underline}

State and local police in Mexico have had [more than 20,000 firearms go
missing or stolen since 2006]{.underline}, according to Mexican military
documents. More than 8,000 rifles and
handguns [disappeared](https://www.animalpolitico.com/2015/05/policias-en-mexico-pierden-seis-armas-de-fuego-al-dia-ya-van-15-mil-robadas-o-extraviadas/) during
that time from police arsenals in the city and state of Mexico and
Guerrero state alone. [[In Guerrero]{.mark},]{.underline} infamous for
corruption and human rights violations by its police and military, [o[ut
of every five firearms legally acquired by police, more than one went
missing or stolen.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[US exports of weapons to]{.mark} the [Mexican armed forces have
grown]{.mark} enormously [as part of the militarised security strategy
that has disastrously failed to reduce homicides.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The use of state weapons in operations to decapitate the leadership of
criminal organisations has provoked more violence among prospective
successors, while also feeding an arms race between criminal groups and
the parts of the state that fight them. In addition, many Mexican police
armed with US weapons directly commit human rights violations. The local
police who attacked students from the Ayotzinapa teachers school and
disappeared 43 of them in 2014, for example, were armed with AR-15
rifles exported by Colt Industries in Connecticut, according to
court [records](https://www.afsc.org/resource/report-where-guns-go).

When police collude with criminal organisations by giving them
information or fighting their rivals in exchange for money, they are
strengthening organised crime, even without directly trafficking weapons
to it. US gun exports to Mexico thus strengthen the very forces, in many
instances, that the arms sales are supposed to combat. 

[[The Trump administration plans
to [deregulate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/new-trump-rules-could-put-american-guns-in-the-hands-of-dictators-terrorists-and-gangs/2017/09/24/7daa4ffe-9fe2-11e7-9c8d-cf053ff30921_story.html?utm_term=.2ea42f2fdec8#comments) such
sales further, which will likely lead to]{.mark} even [more US weapons
in]{.mark} the hands of corrupt or [abusive military and police
forces.]{.mark} The US should instead suspend gun export licenses to
Mexico and reorient its security policy there.]{.underline}

In the US, given the failure of the federal government in Washington to
adequately control the illegal gun market, there are important steps
that state governments can take, especially the southern border states,
where more than three out of four illegal guns in Mexico traced to the
US are purchased, according to the [Government Accounting
Office](https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/674570.pdf). 

[When the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, the sudden, easy
availability in Texas and Arizona of these military-grade rifles
accelerated killing in northern Mexican communities,]{.underline}
independent of the growth of the drug war in that period, causing
hundreds of additional annual deaths, according to a New York
University [study](http://odube.net/papers/Cross_border_spillover.pdf).
[[California, on the other hand, kept an assault weapons ban]{.mark} in
place, [and also requires universal background checks]{.mark} on gun
sales, [unlike Texas and Arizona]{.mark}. As a result, [guns used in
crimes in Mexico were traced to [Texas and
Arizona](https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/674570.pdf) at more than three
times the rate per capita]{.mark}, compared with California, [between
2009 and 2014]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"Since 40 percent of all Mexican
crime guns comes from Texas, state leaders should step up to study and
implement sensible solutions to the deadly problem of gun trafficking,\"
says Andrea Bauer of the group Texas Gun Sense. 

#### A ban on U.S. weapons would work, 2004 empirics prove

Neighbors? Prospects of United States-Mexico Cooperation for Joint
Security", pg. 11-12, <https://muse.jhu.edu/article/705898/pdf>,
6/30/19, CJB)

The experience of 9/11, however, peaked the securitization of the
border. For the most part, Mexico has not developed the same
border-based security concerns. Instead, **[Mexico has a long-standing
insecurity about the flow of arms entering from the United
States.]{.underline}** **[Small arms sales proliferated in the U.S.
borderlands]{.underline}**. Shirk (2011) estimates that ten percent of
U.S. gun dealers are located on the border. **[This proximity and
relatively lax U.S. gun sale laws make small arms easy to obtain and
transfer across the border which contributes to Mexico's violent
crime.]{.underline}** According to Dube et al. (2013), **[the 2004 U.S.
Federal Assault Weapons Ban expiration relates to an increase in
gun-related violence in Mexican cities]{.underline}** close to Texas,
Arizona, and New Mexico. Cities located near the California border did
not see the same rise in homicides -- presumably due to a state law
banning assault weapons.

Many of the reform efforts proposed by Mexican legal and [[human rights
activists seek to incorporate international human rights concepts to
protect]{.mark} citizens [against crime and impunity]{.mark} in lieu of
the Merida-style emphasis on criminal enforcement. A coalition of
nongovernmental [organizations and academics have proposed
constitutional reforms to enhance human rights
protections]{.mark}]{.underline} including those found in the
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, as well
as immigrant and refugee protections. They have advocated the explicit
protection of rights that may not be suspended under any circumstances.
These proposals, moreover, seek to direct attention to the impact of
global economics on socio-economic rights in addition to civil and
political rights as a means of addressing the determinants of crime and
insecurity. They reflect the belief, as expressed by Javier Sicilia, the
leader of Mexico\'s Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity, that
[the [critical legal reforms required to address drug-related
violence]{.mark} would, of necessity, address the paradigmatic
neoliberal economic developments that he describes as constituting \"the
legal form of criminality]{.underline}.\"

[[Other]{.mark} community [groups have organized to implement human
rights treaties to assist victims of torture, wrongful arrests, and
those crimes where no relief could be found in the Mexican criminal
justice system]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For example, in Ciudad
Juarez, where the numbers of women murdered has soared, families of
victims in collaboration with local grassroots organizations invoked the
Istanbul Protocol, which governs the processes for the documentation of
torture, and thereby forced the Mexican government to allow outside
forensic experts to investigate the \[\*1510\] murders of their loved
ones. They succeeded in implementing international standards in order to
obtain an independent investigation by an entity of their own choosing -
the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team - notwithstanding the Mexican
government\'s initial refusal to allow them into the country. Murdered
victims\' families similarly invoked the very same protocol to
investigate the torture of those accused of having committed the crimes.

These campaigns reflect Mexican efforts to [[respond to the challenges
of crime and impunity while insisting upon fairness and justice for the
accused.]{.mark} Social movement activists have [employ]{.mark}ed [the
framework of international human rights norms]{.mark} in support of
their calls to modify laws that have been promoted by the U.S. rule of
law program. Indeed, [legal activism in the name of human rights has
gained popular support,]{.mark} particularly those that seek to develop
collective social benefits as opposed to notions of individualism based
on liberal thought]{.underline}. As a means of defending alternative
forms of seeking justice, civil society groups have emerged calling for
the protection of human rights defenders. In fact[, [the recent focus on
a human rights framework has been described as one of the most important
reforms]{.underline}]{.mark}, having \"the potential to considerably
expand access to justice for ordinary people.\" These developments
suggest that the capacity for developing a \"culture of legality\" is
well developed within Mexico.

International Legal Framework and the Importance of Transparency

Mexico has actively participated in international fora related to
controls on conventional, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons as
well as landmines and cluster bombs, both in the regional system and
globally. One of the aims of the Arms Trade Treaty (att) is to regulate
and make transparent international transfers of firearms with the goals
of prohibiting the sales of arms if the exporting country has knowledge
that the weapons would be used in war crimes, crimes against humanity,
and human rights violations. The United States has signed but not
ratified the treaty.

Although the att allows each State Party to determine how it will
organize its national system to prevent the diversion of conventional
arms, it highlights the importance of national control mechanisms for
the effective and transparent regulation of firearm transfers. Mexico
thus has an obligation to keep a national registry of firearms
transferred for end use in the country.

[The issue of transparency is also relevant in the context of violence
which confronts nations such as Mexico.]{.underline} [We can assume that
[illegal weapons transfers are one]{.mark} of the [cause]{.mark}s [of
violence]{.mark} in Mexico, [but weapons legally transferred]{.mark} to
Mexico [are also involved]{.mark} - particularly given the lack of
clarity about their end users.]{.underline}

[[In this context]{.mark},]{.underline} [it is critical that the United
States - as the largest exporter of firearms to the Mexican government -
proactively strengthen **transparency** and improve systems for
recording, monitoring and controlling the markets and flow of firearms
in both countries.]{.underline} The United States can take these steps
even without ratifying the att.

At the same time, Mexico's Internal Security Law, ratified in December
2017, allows the military to conduct law enforcement activities which do
not correspond to their mission and training, and with no controls that
would prevent or investigate human rights violations. If the Internal
Security Law continues in force, it is likely that the Mexican
military's activities will become even less transparent, based on the
argument that the disclosure of information related to the manufacture,
imports, transfers, and sale of weapons would represent a risk to
national security. There is no evidence to support this argument.
Efforts to promote more effective systems for registering and tracing
weapons sold by the military are key to preventing their use in serious
crimes and human rights violations. But reduced transparency will make
such efforts more difficult.

[[It is critical to end]{.mark} the [inadequate controls]{.mark} on the
issuing of licenses [for firearms exports]{.mark}.]{.underline} On one
hand, the United States is seeking to expand its weapons market by
transferring responsibility for such licenses to the Commerce
Department. On the other hand, Mexico has a **[serious]{.underline}**
problem of weapons diversion and misuse, which could be addressed by
means of effective oversight of both legal arms flows and of end users
of those arms[. Therefore, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} monitor the contexts of violence in weapons-importing
countries]{.underline} and[**, in the case of Mexico, [prohibit the
export of weapons to law enforcement agencies]{.mark} of those Mexican
states [that have committed serious human rights violations.
]{.mark}**[End users that frequently lose weapons]{.mark}, alleging that
they have been robbed, [should also be excluded]{.mark} from u.s. arms
exports, unless investigations determine who was responsible for the
weapons' disappearance and they are held accountable.]{.underline}

\[6/16, John, NACLA Report on the Americas, "A Flexible War", 6/26, IS\]

**[[The biggest winners for drug war arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in Colombia and Mexico [have been]{.underline} Sikorsky (recently
acquired by [Lockheed Martin]{.underline}), which produces Blackhawk
helicopters, [and AM Sales]{.underline}, the Indianabased producer of
Humvees, more than 2,000 of which Mexico purchased last year.
Helicopters may be used to transport troops and equipment, collect
intelligence from above, and for combat operations. Purchases of
Sikorsky Blackhawks by Colombia, in particular, have been particularly
lucrative for the U.S. arms company. Today, Colombia possesses the
fourth largest Blackhawk ﬂeet in the world---and the largest in Latin
America--- with more than 100 Blackhawk helicopters. Though minor
compared to the company's large Department of Defense military projects,
contracts awarded to Lockheed Martin nevertheless amounted to \$63
million USD in 2006 for airborne surveillance and other intelligence
training and equipment in Colombia. Given the fact that today much of
the U.S. military's drug war activities in Latin America are naval in
nature, economic beneﬁciaries of the drug war have in recent years also
included construction interests, hired to build the many new, small
facilities on the Central and South American coasts. Using mostly local
contractors, the Pentagon ﬁnanced some two dozen military construction
projects in Central America between 2009 and 2011---everything ranging
from "counter-narcoterrorism facilities" in Guatemala and Honduras to
operations centers and piers in Panama. The construction contracts for
these facilities were organized through the Army Corps of Engineers, and
also beneﬁtted U.S. shipbuilders and fuel suppliers for naval ships of
all sizes that patrol the region. (Even as the Mexican Navy has become a
favored recipient of U.S. aid, the United States has not constructed
naval bases in Mexico to date.) [These]{.underline} same
[companies]{.underline}, in turn, frequently [**[provide support
for]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[**political campaigns o**f]{.mark}
elected **[ofﬁcials charged]{.mark} [with]{.mark}**
deciding]{.underline} [not only]{.underline} [[the direction of
U.S.]{.mark} [policy]{.mark}]{.underline} [but [also **what products
will be purchased**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Representative Kay
[[Granger]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-TX), [[chair of]{.mark} the [House
Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee]{.mark}]{.underline}
since 2010, has [[expressed]{.underline}]{.mark} a marked [[desire for
helicopters to ﬁght the drug war]{.underline}]{.mark} in Mexico and
Central America. One of [the principal vendors]{.underline} for those
helicopters---[[Textron]{.underline}]{.mark}, which produces Bell
helicopters---[is located right in Granger's Fort Worth
district]{.underline}. [Textron [contributed \$10,000 to Granger's
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2010, [[and employed]{.mark} [nearly
4,000 people]{.mark} [in Fort Worth]{.mark} and thousands more in the
surrounding county]{.underline}. Despite the United States'
overwhelmingly dominant market share in global arms sales, in March
2016, [Granger]{.underline} [wrote]{.underline} [to U.S. Defense
Secretary]{.underline} Ash Carter [and Secretary of State]{.underline}
John Kerry [to complain that]{.underline} she "frequently heard" from
"our friends and allies" [about "excessive delays" in weapons
transfer]{.underline}s, which the congresswoman said was "unacceptable."
Granger's role is reminiscent of that played by a senior U.S. senator in
2000 when Plan Colombia was making its way through Congress. The liberal
Connecticut Senator [Christopher [Dodd had been]{.mark} highly [critical
of]{.mark} U.S. military [intervention in Central
America]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1980s. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Plan Colombia included a large helicopter purchase
component]{.underline}---purportedly to escort coca fumigation aircraft
that came under ﬁre from guerrillas--- [and Dodd lobbied hard for
purchases of]{.underline} Blackhawk [helicopters]{.underline}, [produced
by [Sikorsky]{.mark}, which is [located in his state
and]{.mark}]{.underline} whose parent company [[contributed to
Dodd]{.mark}'s [campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the end,
congressional appropriators split the difference between Sikorsky and
Textron. Another major beneﬁciary of the drug war in Colombia has been
Dyncorp International, a company whose business operations are also
primarily managed from a site in Granger's Fort Worth, Texas district.
The State Department awarded Dyncorp a \$161 million USD contract for
coca eradication in Colombia in 2006; Dyncorp sent a work force of 500
in Colombia shortly thereafter. By 2009, Dyncorp still received \$96.8
million USD for fumigation operations in Colombia. Dyncorp's Beltway
headquarters are in Falls Church, Virginia, in the congressional
district of Republican Representative Frank Wolf, who chaired the same
committee as Granger in 2005-2006. Dyncorp also contributed \$10,000 USD
to Kay Granger's 2010 campaign.

[Moscow's efforts to build ties to Latin America]{.underline} enjoy one
important advantage: [many of these countries are familiar with Soviet
weapons and equipment]{.underline}, having purchased them in years past,
[and are attracted by the lower price tag of Russian]{.underline} arms.
**[Through arms sales, Moscow looks to generate income, displace U.S.
suppliers, and sustain and improve state-to-state security
relationships]{.underline}**. [Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela have
been the leading purchasers of Russian arms in the region]{.underline}.
For example, Russia has supplied 90 percent of Nicaraguan arms imports
since 2000. The volume of arms sales can vary significantly from year to
year, often depending on one major deal. Nevertheless, [Russia has
demonstrated that it is a serious competitor to the United
State]{.underline}s (see figure 2). Between 2000 and 2017, the share of
arms sales to Latin America from Russia was about 20 percent, on par
with the share of U.S. sales, according to data from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute. While recent deals with
Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela have stalled for various [reasons,
Russia is pursuing new opportunities this year with]{.underline}

Mexico-Russia relations today are modest, but [U.S. government threats
to abolish NAFTA and to crack down on immigration have created fissures
in the relationship between Mexico City and Washington that open the
door to Russian exploitation]{.underline}. [Russia has ramped up its
Mexico-related programming]{.underline} in recent months [as part of an
effort to lend support to]{.underline} presidential candidate
**[A]{.underline}**ndrés **[M]{.underline}**anuel
**[L]{.underline}**ópez **[O]{.underline}**brador's campaign in the
upcoming July 1 election. Since last year, RT has been broadcasting
Spanish-language programming favorable to López Obrador, the populist
frontrunner. Other state-run Russian outlets, such as Sputnik, parrot
these pro--López Obrador narratives and are available in a variety of
online formats to the nearly 60 percent of Mexicans who have internet
access or are on social media. Moscow likely views López Obrador as a
potential ally given his populist anti-U.S. views. As Carnegie scholar
Andrew Weiss described in an Atlantic article earlier this year, by
devoting propaganda resources to him, Moscow seeks to promote a
divisive, anti-U.S. campaign in the run-up to Mexico's election. The
Mexican vote is also vulnerable to cyber meddling. El Universal cites an
internal Mexican government report that outlines vulnerabilities in the
new electronic voting system that has been designed to enable Mexicans
to cast their ballots from overseas. More generally, [Moscow likely sees
the Mexican presidential election as an opportunity to retaliate for
perceived U.S. interference in the internal politics of former Soviet
states.]{.underline} In the economic realm, [Mexico is]{.underline}
preparing for the potential unraveling of NAFTA and [looking to Russia
as one of several alternatives to U.S. trade and energy
ties]{.underline}. [Russian expertise in the fertilizer industry and in
energy extraction and processing would complement Mexico's economic
needs.]{.underline} Mexico's state-run oil company Pemex is looking to
privatize some of its components; [Russia's Lukoil has expanded its oil
production in the Gulf of Mexico after having won two tenders from the
Mexican government over the past year]{.underline}. Moreover, although
many Latin American countries welcome Chinese investment, [Mexico's
relationship with China is more cautious, as the two countries have in
recent years competed for access to the U.S. market. This wariness makes
the prospect of commercial deals with Russian entities more
attractive.]{.underline}

#### If we cut off Mexico it will open a geopolitical void which Russia will fill and use as the pinnacle of an Anti-U.S. alliance in the Americas.

[[Russia's rise underscores]{.underline}]{.mark} the significant [[loss

ABSTRACT This article is about how [the governmentality critique of
top-down governance feeds into current interventionary policy
thinking]{.underline}. Drawing on [the Merida Initiative, a US-- Mexican
security cooperation agreement s]{.underline}igned in 2007, the article
[brings out how neoliberal civil society discourse continuously
deconstructs the normative and analytical assumptions, categories, and
concepts of modern liberal-universalism. In the Merida Initiative, civil
society representatives were repeatedly delegitimized for being part of
a detached internationalized NGO bubble.]{.underline} The goal was [to
enable idiosyncratic local knowledge-power to unfold its creative
governing potential unencumbered by the oppressive and counterproductive
reductions and exclusions of liberal-universal episteme.]{.underline} In
this way, [policy thinking actually coincides with the governmentality
critique of standardized knowledge and top-down imposition.]{.underline}
One of the negative implications is that [international
policy-makers]{.underline} l[ose]{.underline} their [ability to
arbitrate according to fixed normative standards.]{.underline} Keywords:
neo-liberalism, epistemology, critique, governmentality, civil society,
[intervention]{.underline} Introduction Governmentality studies---those
a[nalyses]{.underline} that [focus on normalizing disciplinary rule and
population-centred types of knowledge]{.underline}---have had a major
influence on our understanding of neoliberal1 civil society2 frameworks
(Abrahamsen, 2000; Chandler, 2010a; Duffield, 2007). [They
interpre]{.underline}t contemporary [civil society approaches as
refining the application of classic liberal-universal knowledge claims,
such as instrumental rationality]{.underline} and laissez-faire
economics. For example, David Williams sees [international
interveners]{.underline} as [steeped in liberal-universal assumptions
about the subject,]{.underline} [society, and the state.]{.underline} In
his reading, international intervention is a project of 'geographical
universalism' (2008, p. 21). Williams and Young (2012) conceive
Correspondence Local deviants are supposed to be 'disciplined to be
free' (Williams, 1996, p. 173). For governmentality authors, the most
important concern is that neo-liberal civil society is socially
selective, that is, it 'excludes' 'bad attitudes and practices'
(Williams & Young, 2012, pp. 13, 18). Similar to Williams' [critique of
the imposition of liberal templates]{.underline}, James Scott has
opposed 'state simplifications', that is, 'abridged maps' that
'represent\[\...\] only that slice of \[reality\] that interest\[s\] the
official observer' (p. 3).3 As a remedy, Scott (1998) made a case in
favour of more 'local knowledge and know-how' (p. 8). This paper
contends that [contemporary policy thinking shares the governmentality
critique of]{.underline} 'geographical universalism' and '[state
simplifications']{.underline}. Williams' (2008) critique of World Bank
policy in Africa as a 'liberal [project of social transformation' is
actually a mainstay of constructive policy thinking]{.underline} (p.
91). His critique of ['geographical universalism' neatly mirrors how
international policy-makers think about enabling radical alterity 'from
below']{.underline} (2008, p. 21). Similarly, rather than figuring as a
radical counter-discourse, Scott's (2010) critique of 'the view from
above' has become the champion of the new consensus. Thus, the main
argument is that [contemporary civil society frameworks operate through
a critique of naturalist liberal postulates]{.underline}, [such as the
rights-bearing, self-interested subject, capitalist free market
development, and competitive party politics.]{.underline} [They develop
ideological traction by rejecting classic liberal tenets and
standardized forms of knowledge, not by (re-) affirming
them.]{.underline} In the wake, [ironically, they undermine the ability
of international actors to formulate normative judgements]{.underline}.
Paradoxically, [anti-foundational self-critique is both the main
operating element of neo-liberal governance and its chief stumbling
block.]{.underline}

#### Their solution mirrors the Merida Initiative---their attempt at critique only reconstructs regulatory practices by saying what are good and bad forms of weapons control. They are not a break from the status quo; they're exactly what it wants to maintain systemic inequality and violence

These insights are drawn out with reference to the Merida Initiative, a
US--Mexican security cooperation agreement signed in 2007.[4 In the
Merida Initiative, the more policy-makers tried to get in touch with a
truly 'local' set of actors, the more they had to deconstruct the
analytical and normative foundations on which they used to base their
foreign policy]{.underline}. In consequence, [US
policy-makers]{.underline} were f[ind]{.underline}ing [it increasingly
difficult to deliberately arbitrate on Mexico's human rights, rule of
law, and good governance record]{.underline}. The discursive strategies
of US and Mexican actors converged on the critique of liberal blueprints
and standards. It is their collective, taken-for-granted governmentality
and as such is 'not usually open to questioning by its practitioners'
(Dean, 2007, p. 16). Notably, [this study is not about the political
influence of academic scholars]{.underline}, such as Scott and Williams,
[but about how their critical theoretizations parallel now-dominant
policy thinking]{.underline}. There is arguably [no strong causal
relationship between the work of these academics and the policy
world.]{.underline} However, their [conceptual arguments]{.underline}
strangely [reflect key aspects of bottom-up policy
discourse.]{.underline} The first section [reconstructs regulatory
practice in the Merida Initiative.]{.underline} Subsequently, the
[analysis elaborates on how Merida's civil society discourse critiqued
social actors in Mexico as unrepresentative of genuinely local ways of
thinking.]{.underline} The third section presents the work of David
Williams as a paradigmatic example of the governmentality perspective,
while section four offers a critique of it. The last section spells out
the detrimental implications for international policy agency

What is important here is that the [institutional
deficiencies]{.underline} to which the critique of certification drew
attention [were revealed through a critique of inappropriately
reductionist categories of analysis.]{.underline} Certification and the
kind of [policies it promoted articulated a simplistic and contextually
insensitive understanding of the drug problematic and what to do about
it.]{.underline} Standardized categories---**[focusing on a single
objective that could be measured quantitatively---kept policy-makers
from perceiving the really relevant issues]{.underline}**. In brief, the
critique of certification was actually [a critique of using a simplified
optic to order a rich empirical reality]{.underline}. In this way, the
opposition against certification was quite similar to the argument made
by James Scott in 'Seeing like a state' (1998). For Scott, it is the
fact that [government operates through a limited range of standardized
categories and tries to impose them indiscriminately on a diverse social
fabric that causes great harm for the intended beneficiaries of
development schemes]{.underline}. Scott (1998) argues that '\[c\]ertain
forms of knowledge and control require a narrowing of vision' (p. 11).
[The synoptic view from above---in Scott's study, the 'cyclopean
short-sightedness of high-modernist agriculture'---makes the observed
phenomena 'lose their particularity and reappear in schematic or
simplified forms as members of a class of facts', 'ignoring distinctions
that might otherwise be relevant']{.underline} (p. 81). [Standardization
is the central aspect of 'state simplifications']{.underline}: 'However
unique the actual circumstances to the various individuals who make up
the aggregate, it is their sameness, or more precisely, their difference
along a standardized scale of continuum that are of interest' (1998, p.
80). Scott's (1998**[) critique of 'state simplifications' warns against
'dismembering an exceptionally complex and poorly understood set of
relations and processes in order to isolate a single element of
instrumental value']{.underline}** (p. 21). When the Latin America
Working Group (LAWG), a cluster of influential Washington-based [human
rights NGOs]{.underline}, [critique]{.underline}d certification for
being based on the [US Government's claim to 'know\[\...\] best how to
solve the international drug problem']{.underline}, their criticism
seems to resonate rather strongly with Scott's (1998) [argument that the
'insistence' of 'hubris\[tic\]' policy-makers that 'they had a monopoly
on useful knowledge and that they impose this knowledge set the stage
for disaster']{.underline} (p. 247). One might say that 15%-reporting in
the Merida Initiative and its Mechanism of Dialogue with Civil Society
are also 'making a case against an imperial or hegemonic \[\...\]
mentality that excludes the necessary role of local knowledge and
know-how' (Scott, 1998, p. 6). In the LAWG's quote,
[c]{.underline}ertificatio[n appears premised on an external evaluator
assuming universally applicable standardized knowledge and the authority
to apply it across the board in a top-down manner.]{.underline} That is,
certification was a regulatory practice in which interveners Governing
Through Critique 899 assumed a bird's eye view, [replete with a
generalized understanding of how the world works, in this case, the
international drug market]{.underline}. From above, **[US policy-makers
tried to impose uniform standards and policy prescriptions irrespective
of the unique specificities of local context.]{.underline}** And it
would appear that the rise of post-conditionality in the Merida
Initiative departs from this kind of universalist, top-down
knowledge-power. Importantly, if international interveners can no longer
govern by recurring on 'state simplifications', where else are pertinent
policy solutions to come from? As the next section will bring out,
[Merida's civil society discourse proposes an alternative, 'grassroots'
source of knowledgepower, in the wake, shifting agency from US
policy-makers to the intervened themselves.]{.underline}
