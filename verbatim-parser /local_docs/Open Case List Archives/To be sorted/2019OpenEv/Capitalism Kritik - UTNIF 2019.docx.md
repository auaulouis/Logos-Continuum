A notable aspect of **[the post--Cold War arms control agenda has been
the appearance]{.underline}**, and in many respects the relative
success, **[of]{.underline}** what has been labeled as **[a humanitarian
arms control]{.underline}** (HAC) (Greene 2010; Hynek 2007) **[or
humanitarian disarmament]{.underline}** (Borrie 2009, 312; Borrie and
Randin 2006) agenda. This has included, in particular, the campaign on
landmines that led to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, the campaign to ban
cluster munitions that resulted in the 2008 Convention on Cluster
Munitions, and a range of initiatives designed to control the trade in
small arms and light weap- ons, most notably, the 2001 UN Program of
Action on Small Arms. To the extent that current efforts to negotiate an
Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) are animated by humanitarian concerns, this
initiative might also be classi- fied as a further example of HAC in
action. What all these cases of conven- tional arms regulation also have
in common is that they have generally been discussed by commentators as
examples of a control agenda that marks a striking departure from the
traditional practices and foci of arms control and as instances of the
transformative power of global civil soci- ety campaigners working to
operationalize a benevolent human security agenda. This chapter aims to
challenge these assumptions. Instead, it will argue that **[such
initiatives are far more ambiguous in both their roots and their
consequences than mainstream accounts might suggest.]{.underline}**
**[Initiatives]{.underline}** such as those on landmines and cluster
munitions are actu- ally **[part of a much longer history of regulation
and taboos constructed around "pariah weapons."]{.underline}** Following
on from this, I will argue that **[the social construction of certain
weapons as particularly odious has more to do with the interests of
powerful actors]{.underline}** and the relationship of such weapons to
legitimized military technologies **[than any inherently inhu- mane
characteristics]{.underline}** claimed for them. These points will be
illustrated by way of brief discussions on the way the meanings attached
to both cluster munitions and small arms have altered over time. The
chapter will then discuss the ways in which dominant models of economy
and geographies of threat construction have worked to produce particular
approaches to arms trade regulation in different eras. **[A key
contention with regard to the post--Cold War era will be that it has
been characterized by an (appar- ent) arms trade paradox, whereby the
proliferation of formal instruments of international regulation,
ostensibly designed to constrain the conven- tional arms trade, has also
coincided with a shift to a more permissive approach to arms sales in
general]{.underline}**. Viewed at the system level however, the
**[specific combination of permission and proscription]{.underline}**
characteristic of the post--Cold War era **[makes sense as a morphology
of regulation that]{.underline}**, in broad terms, **[aims to
triangulate between efforts to discriminate against pariah actors, to
support the bio-political goals of intrastate pacification in the global
South, and to maintain military hierarchy]{.underline}**. Understood
from this perspective, the humanitarian arms control agenda has had far
more ambiguous effects than its supporters allow. While it has certainly
produced some notable arms control achievements, **[it has also served
to reflect]{.underline}** and reaffirm **[a new "new standard of
civilization]{.underline}**" centered around the distinction between
discriminate and indiscriminate weapons and modes of warfare **[that are
key elements in the legitimizing discourse of both contemporary
militarism and liberal peace intervention]{.underline}**. his chapter
then, represents an attempt to respond to the call from our editors,
Jackie Smith and Ernesto Verdeja, for thinking about peace- building
that is systemic. That is, scholarship that does not simply focus on the
inside of the postconflict state but that, rather, considers how broader
historic and world-system factors shape the global architecture of peace
and violence that specific instances of liberal peacebuilding are both
located in and conditioned by. Accordingly, the chapter will conclude by
briefly considering the implications of this analysis for our
understanding of the role played by arms trade NGOs as actors in the
strategic complexes of the liberal peace and by briefly outlining the
elements of a more eman- cipatory agenda for arms trade regulation.
Humanitarian Arms Control There are a number of common claims that are
made about the various initiatives labeled under the rubric of
humanitarian arms control. First, supporters claim that the bans on
cluster munitions and landmines in particular represent novel moments in
the history of arms control, a nov- elty that stems partly from the fact
that commitments to ban specific cat- egories of conventional weapons
are considered to be unprecedented. As Thakur and Maley have suggested,
for example, the Mine Ban Treaty was "historically significant for being
the first to impose a ban on an entire class of weapons already in
widespread use" (Thakur and Maley 1999; also see Williams 2008, 282).
Second, it is claimed that the bans on antipersonnel mines (APMs) and
cluster munitions as well as international action to address small arms
proliferation represent signal successes of a new post--Cold War human
security agenda (Axworthy 1998, 451; Francheschet 2006, 33--34; Owen
2008). Third, advocates argue that a key element in the success of the
cam- paigns on APMs and cluster munitions in particular has been a
reframing of them as presenting specifically humanitarian problems. It
is this dis- cursive move on the part of campaigners that is deemed to
have enabled them to promote HAC initiatives as issues necessitating
action within the parameters of human security, rather than an arms
control issue subject to the realpolitik logics of national security
(Williams, Goose, Wareham 2008, 2; Cottrell 2009). In particular, the
campaigns on landmines, cluster munitions, and small arms have all been
grounded in a discourse that emphasizes the threat posed to innocent
civilians---which, in the case of the first two in particular, is deemed
a function of the "inherently inhu- mane" (Thakur and Maley 1999, 296)
nature of the technology. A final theme in the narratives on
humanitarian arms control is the emphasis given to the transformative
potential of global civil society (albeit in alliance with key
like-minded states) acting as an expression of bottom-up power, to
persuade the majority of foot-dragging states of the necessity to take
action (Mathew and Rutherford 2003, 29--30; Roberts 2008, 183). In
summary, this is a narrative of the post--Cold War humani- tarian arms
control agenda as a novel, radical, entirely benign, bottom- up endeavor
that places the security of the human at the very heart of practice. The
contribution of HAC initiatives to pre-conflict, in-conflict, and
post-conflict peacebuilding would therefore appear to be both self-
evident and indisputable, not least by reducing the frequency with which
problem weapons are utilized in war and by limiting their deadly legacy
after conflict. There has, of course, been some dispute over the extent
to which HAC initiatives have really produced changes in practice. For
example, the fail- ure of key producer or user states (e.g., the United
States, China, India, Pakistan, Russia) to sign up to the bans on
landmines and cluster muni- tions is widely acknowledged as a weakness.
Similarly, detractors have criticized the tendency in initiatives on
small arms to focus on illicit rather than legal supplies (Mutimer 2006)
and have tended to be less positive about the effect of such initiatives
in actually curbing the small arms trade (Karp 2006). These are
certainly weaknesses that undermine the claims of HAC advocates.
However, in the case of landmines at least, the attempt to construct a
weapons taboo that influences the behavior of actors irrespec- tive of
their formal adherence to the Ottawa Treaty would appear to have been
relatively successful (see table below). Such debates on the scope of
agreements and their implementation as well as studies of the modes of
negotiation and campaigning are cer- tainly important, but they also
reflect a level of analysis problem inherent in much of the literature
on humanitarian arms control; a literature that rarely goes beyond a
narrow, time-bound and policy-orientated discus- sion of campaigning
strategies, policy arguments, and implementation issues. There is,
admittedly, a smaller literature that steps back from this kind of
discussion and undertakes a second level of analysis focused on the
politics of HAC agenda setting, explaining the adoption of particular
initiatives as a function, for example, of the relative abilities of key
NGOs to prescribe or proscribe particular campaigning agendas (Carpenter
2011, 69--102). This kind of approach certainly offers greater
explanatory power compared to the first level of analysis, but it tends
to be both ahis- torical and grounded in an anemic conception of power.
Consequently, it offers only a partial explanation of how specific
control agendas come to be adopted instead of others. My concern, then,
in the remainder of this chapter, is not so much to consider the success
or failure of particular ini- tiatives as understood in the first level
of analysis nor to ponder the rela- tive influence of narrowly defined
sets of norm entrepreneurs. Instead, it is to undertake both a more
historically informed examination of con- ventional arms trade
regulation and one that seeks to explain the relative capacity of
particular actors to set HAC agendas not only in terms of their own
qualities but also as a function of much larger paradigm shifts in, for
example, dominant approaches to economy, security, and war. In order to
do this, however, it is first necessary to illustrate the ahistoricism
at the heart of the literature on HAC by examining the longer history of
both pariah weapons regulation and the way this reflects particular
relation- ships between power, arms ethics, and legitimized weaponry.
This ahistoricism is perhaps most obviously highlighted by the fact that
there is a long record of initiatives aimed at eliminating certain
pariah weapons or restricting their use in particular contexts. Examples
include the attempts to impose bans or limits on the use of poison,
"Greek fire," the crossbow, the gun in seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century Japan, dum dum bullets, and the submarine (Burns
2009). The specific mix of motivations underpinning these attempts has
varied according to each particular case, with some, such as the attempt
to restrict the operation of submarines, arguably more clearly rooted in
state calculations of realpo- litik (Manson 1992). The success of such
initiatives has varied from case to case. For example, restrictions on
the submarine failed to survive the exigencies of total war in World War
II, while restrictions on the gun in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
Japan resulted in its almost total dis- appearance from society, despite
the fact that it had originally been quite widespread (Perrin 1979).
However, notwithstanding their different levels of success, such
restrictions do illustrate that there is nothing particularly novel or
unique to the post--Cold War era attempt to ban specific weapons
technologies. Moreover, the justification of such measures by appeals to
some kind of principled discourse is not unusual. For example, the
prohibition on the use of crossbows issued by the Second Lateran Council
of 1139 (and reissued at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215) was not
only underpinned by the Church and reinforced by religious sanction (the
penalty of anath- ema), but was also represented as a restriction
imposed on "that deadly and God-detested art of slingers and archers"
(Croft 1996, 24). Such views were also reflected in late eleventh- and
early twelfth-century carvings on the pilgrimage churches on the way to
Compostela depicting demons with crossbows (Strickland and Hardy 2011,
61--3). Similarly, prohibitions on the use of poison that appear as far
back as the Hindu Laws of Manu (ca. 2000BC--200AD), have often been
accompanied by some appeal to higher moral standards---whether grounded
in religious ethics or notions of military honor. In particular---like
many pariah weapons---discussions of both proscription and legitimacy
have often evolved around rather fluid concepts of "the standard of
civilization." This was particularly the case in Europe from the
eighteenth century onward when the prohibi- tion against poison became
an accepted part of the laws of war, in part at least because it was
subject to a dual and self-reinforcing construction as a weapon that was
both typical of savages and one that had no place in war between
civilized nations (Price 1997, 26). Not that the standard of
civilization always pointed in the direction of restraint with regard to
pariah weapons. For instance, just as prohibi- tions on the use of the
crossbow were not extended to their use against barbarians, so the
British argued against the ban on dum dum bullets imposed at the 1899
Hague conference on the grounds that the greater destructive potential
of expanding bullets was necessary for use in colo- nial wars because
"the savage, like the tiger . . . will go on fighting even when
desperately wounded" (Spiers 1975, 7). Indeed, the British even
considered adopting a double stock of ammunition---one, consisting of
expanding bullets, for use in colonial wars and another set for use
against a European enemy (ibid.). As Price has noted, then, the
categorization of weapons as humane or inhumane, civilized or
uncivilized, not only natu- ralizes or delegitimizes particular
practices of international violence but also serves to secure (and
indeed construct) the identities of actors in the process (Price 1997,
9). Both moral sentiment and concerns about the standard of civiliza-
tion were also reflected in **[the arms trade provisions of the 1890
Brussels Act]{.underline}**. **[Although principally an antislavery
initiative, the agreement not only included restrictions on firearms
aimed at preventing the slave trade and limiting their "pernicious and
preponderating part" in "internal wars between the native
tribes"]{.underline}** (Burns 1993, 1329), but was also agreed against
the backdrop of a pan-European civil society campaign rooted in ethical
concerns for the colonized. Thus, the British government was bombarded
by letters of support for the act from campaigners concerned at the way
" . . . the indiscriminate trade in firearms and ammunition has been,
and is, a great curse and injury to the native races of Africa" (Let-
ter from Mr. F. W. Fox to Lord Salisbury, October 17, 1889, Fox 1889).
The participants at the Brussels Conference, where the agreement was
negoti- ated, also received numerous communications from groups
supporting the restrictions on the slave, arms, and liquor trades under
discussion. For example, the Aborigines Protection Society sent a
memorial declaring its long-standing commitment to upholding "the right
of uncivilized races to humane and equitable treatment" and arguing that
the supply of firearms and other munitions of war should, as far as
possible, be absolutely forbidden, and that their importa- tion from the
coast to the interior should be strictly limited to the pur- poses
helpful to civilization \[while the relevant local authorities should
be\] rigidly held responsible for any breach of duty in contributing to
internecine war among native tribes (Aborigines Protection Society to
the President of the International Conference in Brussels, December 16,
1889). The eventual outcome was an agreement to restrict the importation
of fire- arms (particularly sophisticated weapons) as well as powder and
ammu- nition into an area extending from the middle of the Sahara to
present-day Namibia and Zimbabwe. However, while particular instances of
arms regulation might be actively supported by campaigners concerned to
promote human welfare, and be framed in the most principled language (of
its era), this tells us little about the broader system of arms trade
regulation in which they are embedded. **[For example, the passage of
the Brussels Act]{.underline}** occurred in a period that "saw the
fewest restraints and regulations on the arms trade in modern history"
(Krause and MacDonald 1992, 712), thus **[illustrat- ing the way in
which instances of apparently ethical restraint can exist within a
highly permissive architecture of regulation]{.underline}**. This raises
two questions: what creates the facilitating conditions for ethical
appeals for arms restraint to gain traction even in such circumstances,
and how can we understand their relationship to the global system of
arms regulation? Four factors are crucial: the relationship between arms
regulation and the narrow political and material interests of powerful
actors; the rela- tionship between pariah weapons and legitimized
military technology; the relationship between economic philosophy and
the approach to arms regulation; and the relationship between the global
system of arms trade regulation and the dominant framing of threats in
particular eras. Only by examining the interplay of these factors can we
properly reflect on the role played by global civil society campaigns on
the arms trade and con- sider their effects on broader efforts to
promote peace---both globally and in the aftermath of local conflicts.
Power and Interest Discussions of humanitarian arms control tend to
represent campaigning NGOs as agents of the powerless acting (albeit in
alliance with some like- minded states) to mobilize global public
opinion and pressure the larger body of reluctant states to adopt
principled measures designed to fur- ther human welfare. Alternatively,
some analysts have also highlighted the way middle-ranking states such
as Canada have used campaigns on landmines or small arms as vehicles to
enhance their diplomatic status in international forums such as the UN
(Cottrell 2009). Both of these frame- works certainly capture important
ways in which power and interest have interacted in the HAC agenda.
However, even a brief analysis of the longer history of pariah weapons
restrictions illustrates the need for more con- sideration of the way
current initiatives might mirror older initiatives in reinforcing the
interests of powerful actors. For example, one factor in the virtual
eradication of the gun in sev- enteenth- and eighteenth-century Japan
was that it represented a threat to the warrior class when in the hands
of the lower classes (Perrin 1979, 25--33). Similarly, although the
**[weapons restrictions in the 1890 Brussels Act]{.underline}** were
certainly grounded in an ethical discourse, they **[were primarily
rooted in concerns about the impact of the arms trade on colonial
order]{.underline}**. For instance, one British official calculated at
the time that eighty thou- sand to one hundred thousand firearms
annually were entering Africa via East African ports (Beachey 1962,
453), while immediately before the Brussels Conference convened, six
hundred thousand rifles destined for Africa were sold in Antwerp (Krause
and MacDonald 1992). Conse- quently, as one British official observed:
The chief value of the work of the Brussels conference lies . . . in the
uniform rules to be applied to the introduction of arms and spirits. . .
. Without such rules and provisions I regard the government of Africa by
Europeans \[as\] impossible. The African Continent . . . is far from
rich, it is tropical and feverish, and will prove not worth holding in
the face of a population of savages supplied with firearms and degraded
with trade spirits (Memorandum by Sir John Kirk, August 15, 1891). Thus,
as Engelbrecht and Hanighen would later observe, **[the arms ele- ments
of the Brussels Act were "a selfish measure of the great imperialist
powers to keep modern weapons out of their colonies and to hold them in
submission"]{.underline}** (Engelbrecht and Hanighen 1934, 267). This
same concern also prompted various efforts to ensure guns were stamped,
registered, and licensed, as well as to restrict gun ownership to
officials or "reliable persons." The signatory powers also agreed to
exchange information with each other (Beachey 1962, 457). Other
initiatives stemming from the same urge to control the proliferation of
firearms included the imposition of a gun tax under the Uganda Agreement
of 1900, resulting in the surrender of many obsolete weapons not
considered worthy of such a tax (ibid., 461). The history of pariah
weapons regulation would therefore appear to demonstrate a persistent
link between the material and political interests of states and/or
powerful elites and the emergence of pariah weapons regulation. Of
course, the material and political interests of the same, or other,
powerful actors also provide countervailing pressures. For exam- ple,
the immediate interests of nobles in winning wars with crossbows mostly
won out over their broader class interests (McNeill 1982, 67--80). But
the point is that attempts at pariah regulation cannot be explained
purely by reference to popular pressure or humanitarian concerns. Yet
despite this there has been little reflection on the part of
commentators regarding the ways in which contemporary restrictions might
reflect the interests of powerful states and other actors, albeit in
ways that are sub- ject to similar countervailing pressures---an issue
that will be explored in more detail below. Constructing the "Other" of
the Legitimized and Heroic Weapon The relationship between power,
interest, and regulation can sometimes be direct, as in the case of bans
on swords or crossbows that pose a threat to elites. This relationship
can also manifest itself in both more indirect and complex ways---one
example being the manner in which the narra- tives deployed by hegemonic
actors to legitimize dominant weapons and ways of war can have the
effect of delegitimizing particular categories of weapons that fail to
accord with such narratives. In some cases this may occur as an
unintended consequence of the dominant framing. In other cases the
process of delegitimization may be actively promoted, for example as
part of a process by which other weapons are constructed as
"heroic"---weapons deemed to embody positive values such as honor and/or
values that are deemed central to national defense. For example, the
series of relatively successful acts implemented in England between 1508
and 1542 banning crossbows and handguns (albeit initially with an
exemption for men worth more than £100 per annum) were largely rooted in
a concern to preserve the use of the heroic long- bow, deemed central to
a long line of English military successes (Payne- Gallwey 2007, 34). The
Japanese ban on the gun was similarly connected to the romanticization
of the heroic samurai sword as the visible form of one's honor and as
associated with grace of movement in battle (Perrin 1979). In effect
both weapons became the "other" that defined legitimized military
technologies and militarism. Similar themes also help explain the
contemporary taboos constructed around particular sets of military
technology such as cluster munitions. Cluster Munitions What is notable
about the campaign against cluster munitions is not that it succeeded in
banning an inhumane weapon but that this success occurred when cluster
munitions use was actually in decline compared to the peak years of the
Vietnam era (Borrie 2009, 433--36). The latter was a period when some
790,000 cluster bombs containing 383 million submunitions were dropped
on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, a total greater than their combined
populations (Prokosch 1995, 97). The United States also contem- plated
using them even more extensively. For example, the August 1966 JASON
Report proposed an antipersonnel and antivehicle barrier along the
demilitarized zone, which required the monthly use of approximately
20,000 CBU-24 cluster bombs. Given that each CBU-24 included between 640
and 670 submunitions (Borrie 2009, 11), this implied the distribution of
at least 12.8 million submunitions per month. Although this proposal was
never implemented, it reflected the fact that, in the opinion of the US
military, "CBUs were categorized as a standard weapon, to be taken off
the shelf---'conventional ironmongery'" (Krepon 1974, 600). This is not
to suggest that the United States use of cluster munitions in this
period went unremarked. For example, there were efforts in the 1970s by
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to promote
restrictions on their use (Borrie 2009, 11--16). The point is, however,
that these efforts never achieved traction either in diplomatic forums
or with a wider public in the way that the issue would thirty years
later. The same point can also be made with respect to landmines, which,
as early as the mid-1950s, were discussed in the secret committee
established to imple- ment the Tripartite Agreement between France, the
United States, and Britain to restrict arms sales to the Middle East.
However, in response to a French query as to whether APM exports should
be restricted on "human- itarian grounds," the United States responded
(and Britain concurred) that landmines were not "any more or less
objectionable on humanitarian grounds than any other weapons" (Near East
Arms Coordinating Com- mittee, Minutes, November 14, 1954). Reframing
cluster munitions and landmines as immoral and inhu- mane was only made
feasible with the advent of three interrelated fac- tors: the
mainstreaming of human security, the framing of intervention as
humanitarian, and the construction of modern weapons as humane because
of their greater capacity for precision. The mainstreaming of human
security in the policy discourse of governments (however tokenistic in
practice) created a facilitating environment in which the reconstruction
of cluster munitions and landmines as threats to the human (understood
as innocent civilians) could be undertaken. This was further enhanced by
the representation of intervention as humanitarian and of precision
weapons as instruments of a humane Western way of warfare undertaken to
save strangers from "thugs who know little and care less about civilized
behaviour" (Guthrie, cited in Coker 2001, 3). The combined effect was to
create a legitimized discursive space into which campaigners could
insert a re-representation of landmines and cluster munitions technology
as inhumane. The introduction of bans on cluster munitions and APMs is
there- fore a far more ambiguous achievement than is generally suggested
in the mainstream literature. On the one hand, the legitimizing
discourse of Western militaries and arms firms was turned against them
in order to generate powerful taboos against particular categories of
weapons--- even in the face of opposition from these militaries. On the
other hand, as I have argued elsewhere, "the same **[prohibitions can be
understood as performative acts that simultaneously function to codify
aspects of a new set of criteria for judging international
respectability in a post--Cold War era, to reinforce the security
framings of the era and to legitimize those categories of weapons
successfully constructed as precise, discriminate and thus
humane]{.underline}**" (Cooper 2011, 145).

#### The "One China" frame of the affirmative relies on the reduction of Taiwan to a commodity for political exchange with china in a western system of globalization -- the reduction of Taiwanese independence to a negotiating point renders the western hegemony of capitalism inevitable -- justifying violence and imperial expansion lead by Chinese and American Capitalists.

I have argued that **[Taiwan\'s contentious past is strong enough that
it]{.underline}** con- Ceptually **[leads to a kind Of ahistorical
situation, where this]{.underline}** contention **[could dislodge
Western metanarratives]{.underline}**. This is a case where **[Taiwan is
not historiciz- able without acknowledging the rivalrous politics of
representation and resis- tance, which includes origin notions as well
as senses Of discontinuity]{.underline}**. Now I wish to shift to the
sense of Taiwan in a segment of the American media, here Los Angeles
Times editorials. My purpose in moving to the editor- ial is to show how
these editorials do not lead to a grasp of Taiwan as a com- plicated
place, or dehistoricize it. **[This involves a discursive prose economy
Of restriction, which favors the mainland narrative of Taiwan\'s return,
which for Americans is the easy way out of confronting our own hegemonic
interests]{.underline}**. In short, **[representation for purposes Of
persuasion]{.underline}**, as Old as rhetoric (i.e., poli- tics) itself,
**[has become an Asia-for-American]{.underline}**s, where journalists as
well con- nected as Edgar Snow and scholars as well established as John
Fairbanks have made representations that saturate American readers in
narrativized, prosaic 32 The latter is a persistent prose form. Despite
some outstanding reporting and event analysis on Asia by some Los
Angeles Times writers,\" c**[onstruction of ideas and images of Taiwan
through the more directed editorial page remains a paramount instance Of
misfigura- tion]{.underline}**. **[The editorial mode is]{.underline}**
an everyday prose text that makes **[a mental image or concept Of action
and relationship]{.underline}**. The usual editorial is close to a mode
of persuasion and dissuasion when it brings current theories and
politics to pub- lic discourse, giving prosaic figuration. **[For
example,]{.underline}** there have been, nation- ally, hundreds Of
editorial columns using the phrase \"**[Asian miracle]{.underline}**,\"
**[a phrase that embeds Asian financial and cultural life in Western
notions of economics]{.underline}**, **[threaded to uncontested notions
Of growth and \"take-off,\" conjuring senses Of development, Asia
simplified and corresponding to the type, Asians R Us.]{.underline}**
While an exhibit by a Taipei artist depicting Asian icons with Western
pornog- raphy \"growing onto\" sacred Asian sensibilities requires its
own terms, once described for an American audience as \"bold\" and
\"audacious,\" it acquires the historicizing functions of \"the first
show that did that,\" which feeds various senses that are potential
misfigurations. Further, my reading of the Los Angeles Times editorials
on Taiwan borrows from the conceptual framework of Tzvetan Todorov\'s
The Morals of History (1995), a book that takes great pains to set forth
categories Of figuring forth others in modern Western writing. Let me
discuss Todorov\'s book as a con- ceptual point Of entry to my \"local\"
reading of the Times. In surveying the his- tory of wordedness or
interpretative and ideological relations between Spanish conquerors and
what they did to Indian texts, using commentaries by oppo- nents of the
conquest such as Las Casas or apologists like Sepulveda, Todorov argues
that **[Western assimilation smuggles in the premise of its own
superior- ity; for]{.underline}** instance, **[the rule of law is said
to show our advanced development de- spite the political violence of
Western history]{.underline}**.34 **[The West claims superiority as it
tries to avoid tagging others as inferior. No one wants to admit to
superior- ism]{.underline}**, Todorov continues, **[so we privilege
dialogism]{.underline}**, to \"read myself in quota- tion marks,\" Often
favored when referring to Others.\" **[Our affective
feelings]{.underline}** for others, **[say admiration for \"Asian
loyalty]{.underline}**,\" **[often accompanies nonknowl-
edge,]{.underline}** as in the case of Montaigne\'s regret for the
slaughter Of the Aztecs, **[which was based on a Western failure to live
up to its own ideals]{.underline}**, not on the intrin- sic worth of
Aztec life. Of course emphasis upon a culture or civilization\'s in-
ternal articulation of differences---their make it impossible to
understand them at all. **[In Todorov\'s notion of Western wordedness,
truth and misfiguration are al- ways co-present]{.underline}**. In
addition to risks of superiorism, historical writing presup- poses
truth-disclosure, an intersubjective truth, not a referential one. When
is- sues of fact are unsettled, we expect a \"depth of penetration\" to
provide a collective interpretation that spans group interests, serving
as the basis for fur- ther discussions. **[This kind of truth aims at
\"adherence among readers.\"]{.underline}** Here things get sticky. For
with intersubjective interpretations, we are interested not so much in
adequacy of discourse to referent, but in reaching agreement. Ad-
herence is often at Odds with truth-adequation, with its epistemic
atomism Or regression to the facts, but insistence that some facts
cannot be explained away. How does one get from \"facts\" to an
inclusive discourse that actually absorbs each fact\'s adequacy without
distortion? Of all the facts, including those about processes, available
about Asian economies since 1970, how did the phrase \"Asian miracle\"
arise? Further, depth interpretations, requiring adherence, giv- ing
intersubjective connections, can be coherent in one way, but can render
a larger incoherence in relation to another interpretation. **[A
coherent interpre- tation is bound to be reductive just because it
smoothes and resolves con- tention]{.underline}**. In sum,
**[in]{.underline}** those **[areas]{.underline}** **[ruled by
intersubjectivity---politics, culture, morality, aesthetics, and
language---truth as adequation and truth as disclo- sure opens onto the
consequence that coherence is not very intellectually stim-
ulating]{.underline}**; **[the possible incoherence is
stimulating]{.underline}**. Try as he may, Montaigne\'s denunciation of
Eurocentrism in the name Of equality also gave Eurocentrism a lease on
life once Europeans used the ideal of equality, its irresistible coher-
ence, to oppress Africans, among others, in the nineteenth century.36
Another way Of putting Todorov\'s construal of history and misfiguration
is just to emphasize that representation and resistance can collide in
any public claim to mediate **[representation]{.underline}**. Public
newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times **[can be used to intensify,
slow down, speed up, displace, etc. what \"counts\"]{.underline}** as
news, namely, **[decisions by governing bodies]{.underline}**; in
another register, this means that one is al\'.vays caught up in
privileging certain mediating roles, such as those Of cultural guide, or
political prophet, or existential naysayer, or the wis- dom of the
businessman. This also occurs in Taiwanese life. For example, in July
1998 a conference was held in Taiwan at Tsing-Hua University, with the
title \"Problematizing Asia. \" The conference continued lines of
thought opened by cultural (mainly British) and postcolonial studies. In
the announcement of the conference, via e-mail, the chief organizer said
that a gathering is necessary because of the coming into dominance of
the phrase \"rise of Asia\" (dated from the mid-1980s), specifically the
fact that **[Asia was again an obsession of the West. Calling for an
\"intervention\" so as to \"fill the gap\" in what the various Western
and Asian discursive regimes have neglected]{.underline}**, the
\"Problematizing Asia\" conference asked questions so broad that their
sheer scale dominated as rhetorical form. Citing \"local, national,
regional, international and global lev- els,\" the organizer asked,
\"How do we place \'Taiwan\' in these contexts?\" Here, a progressive
group\'s immediate worry was over Taiwanese nationalism---pro-
aboriginal/proindependence for Taiwan---a worry that seems to have
England at the time of Thatcher\'s ascendancy in mind, where right-wing
nationalism was revived, adding to the difficulties Of establishing a
new critical left. But should response to Thatcherist nationalism serve
as a model for Taiwanese in- tellectual resistance to Taiwanese
nationalism? One Can certainly see what is at stake when it comes to
concepts and im- ages of Asia in the editorial page of the Los Angeles
Times. As said above, there is more writing by the Times on Asia than
the editorials. Apart from headline stories, Jim Mann\'s \"international
outlook\" regularly gave a deep sense of the historical and temporal
issues involved. The business section reports on the fi- nancial
turmoil, from a persistently dreadful perspective of Asia as a place of
lower costs and infinite needs. I am going to restrict my comments to
the ed- itorials written by Tom Plate, who in the period under
discussion wrote all Of the editorials for the Times, whose byline
listed teaching in UCLA\'s commu- nication and policy studies program,
and who heads an Asia Institute at UCLA, an organization of schools and
corporate sponsors that promotes glo- balization in its \"moderate\"
form. The editorials discussed are an active attempt by the Times to
shape public opinion, the editorial itself timed to Asian \"events\" so
as to be more immedi- ate in its impact. Editorial practice often serves
to anticipate the possibilities Of a future event and because Of this
quality, its timing connects immediate and structural forces at once. An
editorial, in short, is one Of the forms in which readers do not grapple
with problems so much as receive interest and motivation, immediate
impressions, even if they are canceled the next day by another
editorial. They are more or less consistent tapes of guidance for the
uninitiated. **[These impressions naturalize the political and
intellectual, giving it the form of the unquestionable]{.underline}**
(the \"real\" right now). **[An editorial aims not so much at
instruction as at guidance]{.underline}**---**[shaping consensus for
tomorrow\'s conflicts, defusing the contentiousness Of Other
perspectives, leading its read- ers to the necessity of what tomorrow is
to look like. It is all about the making of coherence.]{.underline}**
Let us start then with an editorial from August 1997. Plate writes that
the \"Pacific Rim community\" is a real entity, required not just by the
historical moment of a \"Rise of Asia\" nor by trade concerns, but by
the need for a \"brain-trust\" of the \"best universities\" in the
United States, Asia, and Latin America. The president ofUSC is cited,
for whom \"LA. is the Rome of the (Pacific) Rim,\" a community of the
best universities that are \"brand names\" in Asia, where \"a U.S.
degree is worn like a badge of honor. \"38 There is said to be a
\"bond\" between Pacific Rim universities, a \"sunny optimism\"
underlying their \"common challenges\" concerning economic development,
this positive model set against a right wing in California protesting
China\'s rent of docks at Long Beach. There are Asians \"like us\" and
there are Americans stuck in Mc- Carthyism. In a few sentences the prose
frees the West\'s global community from opposition to it. In the same
sentence, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Singa- pore are said to have replaced
New York, Paris, and Rome as world centers, but this is put
hysterically: \"the university group aspires to be this new com-
munity\'s on-call brain cell, \" where \"on-call\" privileges economic
managers, fi- nancial traders, dealers Of all sorts, including those
involved in the circulation Of symbol, sign, image. None Of this talk of
corporate and university \"brain- trusts\" is connected to such past
practices as what happened with U .S. profes- sors advising, say, the
Chilean military and business interests. In August of 1997, the column
\"On Taiwan, Beijing Learns to Yawn\" com- pliments Beijing over an
impending visit from the president of Taiwan, a one- night touchdown on
U.S. soil (Hawaii). Beijing\'s not going berserk is made a sign of its
\"maturity\" and is opposed to the \"latest, potentially trouble
making\" move by Taiwan. The \"maturity\" Of 1997 corrects Beijing\'s
being \'Sultratouchy\" in 1996, when it lobbed missiles close to Taiwan.
Beijing has earned the right to be touchy because
\"**[Beijing]{.underline}**, as well as a lot Of Chinese (and more than
a few people inside Taiwan) **[regard Taiwan as an integral part Of
historic China]{.underline}**.\" Rather than define \"integral\" and
\"historic,\" words with a large range Of PO- tential misfiguration,
**[the article images Taiwan as provoking China, by having a \"perceived
campaign of clever resistance to the process of eventual reunifica-
tion]{.underline}**.\" **[\"Clever\" goes with \"trouble making,\"
giving those Taiwanese the qual- icy \"aggressive, \" while \"maturity\"
and \"touchy\" gives the mainland government the quality Of
\"provoked.\"]{.underline}** This is the coherence of which Todorov
speaks--- **[the Taiwanese are given a totalizing, overly coherent,
interpretation, in the negative]{.underline}**. The next phrase reads:
\"In fact, **[the diplomatic reality is that tiny but economically
over-achieving Taiwan is formally recognized as an independent
government by only 30 countries]{.underline}**, one of which is Panama,
and not by either the U.N. or the U.S. But **[its feisty government and
newfound democratic ways combine to create the effect of an independent
state, which stations an army of loyalists and lobbyists in
America]{.underline}**.\"39 Let us name each of the pejora- tives ladled
over Taiwan, or the use of coherent history to delegitimize.
\"**[Diplomatic reality]{.underline}**\" **[refers to
governmental]{.underline}** and U.N. **[acceptance of mainland Chinese
claims over Taiwan.]{.underline}** This Omits the U.N. decision Of 1952
that affirmed self-determination as a principle for nonstates. \"Tiny\"
reduces and \"over-achieving\" goes with \"tiny\" to form the image Of
an aggressive group, with the insult or curse that Panama, alone Of the
thirty supporting govern- ments mentioned, recognizes Taiwan. **[If
Taiwan is supported by Panama, then Taiwan must be eccentric or worse,
insignificant except as a problem.]{.underline}** \"Feisty\" could be a
nod to something affirmative about Taiwan, but \"**[newfound
democracy]{.underline}**\" **[undercuts]{.underline}** that, depriving
**[Taiwan\'s government of legitimacy, as if there is something suspect
about Taiwanese democracy. Taiwan only looks like a country, but is not
one really. The reduction is \"confirmed\" by the rhetoric Of militancy:
\"stations\" an \"army\" in this country raises the ugly specter of Tai-
wan buying its legitimacy]{.underline}**. **[The Taiwanese are construed
as illegitimately ag- gressiv]{.underline}**e, hence closer to Libya
than to mainland China\'s claim Of historic rights. In a single
editorial, the historiographics of complexity are ruined. It is the U.S.
Congress that listens to Taiwan because Of campaign contributions etc.,
but the State Department and presidency are, one hopes, smarter about
the long-term interests of that PacRim community whose brain is
\"on-line\" or \"on-call.\" **[Rhetoric has eaten into any semblance of
objectivity, devoured it.]{.underline}** In Todorov\'s terms,
**[this]{.underline}** specific editorial **[repeats]{.underline}**
Sepulveda\'s mode Of **[superior- ism]{.underline}**, **[rhetoric
blocking any sense here that Taiwan has grounds to resist either China
or America acting in China\'s interests]{.underline}**-40 **[Taiwan is
removed from the Asia called for to participate in Westerniza-
tion/globalization]{.underline}**. The Taiwanese should not derail the
United States\' ability \"to work both sides Of the Taiwan strait. The
**[Taiwanese should be deprived Of \"leverage\" that would \"imperil
Sino-U.S. relations.\"]{.underline}** In effect, the prose is- sues
warnings: if left to their own devices, the Taiwanese will \"sabotage\"
the fu- ture, an ominous throwback to the visual imagery of the stealthy
Asian spy out of anti-Japanese propaganda films of World War Il. In
another editorial, **[Asians are cited to remind us of our own better
selves, readers getting ideals from unobjectionable \"others,\" but
subject to negative images]{.underline}**---Taiwan is close, negatively,
to Malaysia, the prime minister of Malaysia is called \"bush- league\"
for distinguishing between foreign capital and foreign rogue capital
(i.e., currency speculators like George Soros).41 The \"PacRim
community\" would newer have allowed Indonesia\'s disastrous forest
fires to occur, for this group would have installed \"Asian
regionalization\" or Western-style crisis management. Westerners need to
pay attention to \"face,\" no perspective al- lowed but from those
Asians who are like us. The mayor Of Shanghai, Xu Kuangdi, is quoted as
saying, \"We like Americans \... (they are) easy to read and we Chinese
appreciate that,\" this in the context of Xu\'s identification with Rudy
Giuliani in New York or Richard Riordan in Los Angeles. Xu wants to
build Shanghai according to the logic of an American film: \"if we build
it, they will come.\" Who is quoting whom and what in this hallucination
Of identi- ties? **[A Western image exported to an Asian leader just
like us returns as he is made to say what we approve of]{.underline}**;
**[the sense here, regular fare of the editorial, its antiproduction of
questions and problems, preserves Westernization as it turns Taiwan and
other places \"into history\" or out of the future.]{.underline}** The
\"on-call brain cell\" of the PacRim community is mobilized in an edi-
torial of May 1998 and set against East Coast newspaper columnists who
op- pose Clinton\'s appearance at \*fiananmen Square in June Of 1998.
Plate Calls his rival East Coast journalists \"potentates,\"
orientalized in the negative, and who have no sense, he says,
ofTiananmen apart from June Of 1989; they should un- derstand that
Chinese leaders ceremonialize with all foreign dignitaries in Tiananmen,
so that its \"historical\" force, as opposed to its \"historic\"
associa- tion with the murder Of workers and students, is misunderstood
by critics. Clinton should not miss the opportunity to 100k \"like a
champ\" at Tianan- men, just as the Chinese leaders should not reject
\"a fabulous opportunity to look great.\" (Is all this Pop writing about
Asia a little weird?) **[Taiwan returns in association with worries

nasty would technologically capable but tiny Taiwan Start plotting to

ative redundancy]{.underline}**. In an editorial from May 26, 1998, over
questionable Chi- nese funds slipped to the Democrats and funds from the
Loral Corporation to the People\'s Liberation Army commercial division,
the subject is dismissed with the comparison that \"money from China was
clumsily emulating foreign lobbying operations like Taiwan\'s and
Israel\'s**[.\" Taiwan is emulated when countries do negative things,
hence Taiwan is encoded as demonic---it sets off \"nocturnal
intensities\"]{.underline}** (Deleuze and Guattari). **[Taiwan belongs
to and partic- ipates in no dynamics but self-survival, and is
illegitimate in making moral claims that Westerners might
recognize]{.underline}**. Even fright is proposed to the Times\'
audience: \"are we really ready to risk a new cold war over this?\" The
wrangle over China\'s entry to the WTO is turned into the fear that its
defeat would produce a \"new-age Maoism,\" depriving the \"best and
brightest\" of China\'s university leaders of a \"cosmopolitan vision Of
higher education, citing as \"evidence\" the president Of Fudan
University that \"there isn\'t a single faculty member here who has
adopted a negative attitude toward the Inter- net.\" 42 Not one? **[If
Taiwan has no claim to an autonomous future, China should dread the
return Of its past.]{.underline}** The March 2000 election of the
Democra- tic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian intensifies all
this misfigura- tion. In an editorial of May 24, 2000, the China Trade
Bill is claimed to be of \"historic\" value, a tag withheld from the
political elections in Taiwan---the first Such elections in all Of
Chinese history---and if the China Trade Bill is passed (it was), this
will \"bind China ever more firmly into a new world order of peace,
international process and political predictability,\" a line straight
out Of Francis Fukuyama, lauded in an earlier editorial.43 **[History
returns in that the leaders Of the United States, China, and Taiwan
should turn away from China\'s human rights actions---still no
discussion of Taiwan actually becom- ing more democratic---this because
Westerners should \"grant China overdue recognition of its absolutely

legitimizing China\'s future, which is the same thing as le- gitimizing
the present Chinese leadership]{.underline}**. The Democratic
Progressive Party\'s surpassing the barriers of KMT and Western
interests is hauled into this his- tory only because Chen Shui-bian\'s
inaugural speech was \"tremendous, his- toric,\" because he showed
\"respect (forl \... Beijing\'s policy Of \'one China\' yet without
selling Taiwan\'s people down the river.\" Chen\'s \"respect\" was
under- stood in Taiwan as a tactical move, omitted here. Relying again
on the PacRim\'s \"insider\" knowledge, the views of Wang Daohan, doyen
of the Peo- ple\'s Republic Of China\'s Taiwan policy, are put forward
as historical wisdom, \"whose responses to our written questions are
known to have been cleared by the all-powerful Central Committee in
Beijing \... (whol called for tolerance on both sides**[.\" Taiwan must
reunifed with the \"motherland\" and Taiwan will have an ever better
deal than Hong Kong: \"What a deal this is!]{.underline}** (DaohanJ is
saying. \"45 Immediately after the election of the DPP candidate, a
column took up China\'s \"White Paper\" on Taiwan, released just before
the March 2000 elec- tions. Here the party reaffirmed the 1949 One China
principle, which was re- ally, as noted above, a principle shared with
the Kuomintang insofar as they trace their genealogy to Sun Yat-sen\'s
reforms and the Republic of China of 1911. Why not discuss 1911? Citing
mainland Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the \"White Paper\" is affirmed as
the \"time-honored Chinese way of saying that Only the full course Of
history can correct an injustice built up over the course Of time. \"46
That is, **[China\'s continuous historical claims to Taiwan are
presented as fact. The question of Taiwan\'s independence is nothing
more, now, than a \"negotiating point.\"]{.underline}** In an editorial
four days after the defeat Of the KMT in Taiwan, the negative marker
\"tiny island\" returns, this time not to affirm Tai- wanese
sovereignty, but only as an end to the KMT \"behemoth\": the Taiwan
political transformation is not about independence, only the Taiwan
middle class pushed the DPP into office; the election was really about
\"corruption,\" the voters said to be concerned with globalization (
anticronyism), not pol- itics.47 **[The discourse keeps on track the
affirmation of China as embodying historical continuity, this via the
motherland unity argument, a delegitimation Of the autonomy Of politics
on Taiwan. Globalization here is used as a lever of antilocal
politics]{.underline}**.\" America should have a \"Goldilocks\" attitude
toward China: a \"just right\" attitude of balance, which nonetheless is
based on accep- tance of Beijing\'s demand that Taiwan is a
\"disrespectful, wayward son that must---somehow---be returned to the
family fold.\" 49 **[Taiwan has been Oedi- palized]{.underline}** (the
time span Of the editorials roughly correlating with the time it takes
to manifest Oedipus in children). Citing yet another well-placed
\"source,\" a \"contact\" at the Rand Corporation, readers are told that
Americans must try to make sure that China is not placed in the vise
where they will in- vade Taiwan \"if they have no choice,\" i.e.,
Taiwan\'s political life must be de- politicized. Hence **[American
foreign policy must \"avoid strategic intimacy\" with
Taiwan,]{.underline}** or Congress must foreswear any \"formal
alliance\" with Taiwan. As before, Taiwan must not be treated as
sovereign. In fact, the American pub- lic must listen to our \"wise\"
and enlightened think-tank corporate \"players\" for whom the \"third
way\" toward China relations (here reduced to hawk/dove,
containment/engagement) is acongagement,\" or \"a little Of this, a
little of that; lean a little left, then to the right,\" this to pursue
the inexorable aims Of glob- alizati0n.50 Thus China\'s \"leftist
purists\" who criticize Premier Zhu Rongji for rushi or \"entry to the
world\" (510balizationP and American conservatives or liberal-unionists
should both get out of the way. So too must Taiwanese inde- pendence
groups.\" **[All this lopsided \"coherence\" has the effect of making
Taiwan disappear. Its history of continuous discontinuity with invaders
of all sorts is removed from present discourse]{.underline}**. That the
KMT\'s fifty-year domination might now dissolve, be made into something
else, is unthinkable, i.e., that the island\'s self-sorting out can be
achieved in its own **[register. Taiwan remains pre-historical, and not
out of choice.]{.underline}** The editorial that calls Clinton and
Zemin\'s meeting \"historic\" also de- clares, \"**[A new order is
descending on Asia.]{.underline}** This is no historical accident.\"
Thus, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji are not \"parochial \";52 one should be
glee- ful over Clinton\'s rejection in Beijing of independence for
Taiwan (communism in China and neoconservative-liberalism in America
locked into No Clauses); then a rhetorical question: whether Taiwan
\"suddenly finds itself On the wrong side of history. With but 21
million people (tiny, again) the offshore island is a democracy that
will never be a superpower or threaten anyone militarily.\"53 The
\"wrong side of history\" is a phrase of pure terror---extreme
disidentifica- tion with Taiwan\'s actual political transformation in
March 2000. Again, **[the linkage to China always makes Taiwan disappear
into historiographic oblivion--- history used to denarrate. I call this
a strong instance of historical narration in the restrictive mode,
disturbing because it gives its readers the satisfactions of eliminating
rival concepts and attending social and political
arrangements.]{.underline}** In fact, these editorials complete the
dehistoricization of Taiwan: \"The United Nations and the United States
refuse to recognize Taiwan as an official nation \... But even if you
find no pathos at all in Taiwan\'s plight \... the man- ner Of
Beijing\'s resolution Of this grating rebuke (March 2000 elections) to
mainland Communism will reveal much. \"54 **[What matters in this
reduction Of conflict, in which \"historic\" and \"historical\" and
related terms are crucial stakes, is only how the mainland is perceived
by the West---China should avoid violence]{.underline}**. Those pesky
and trouble-making Taiwanese should listen to Clinton, who passes into
the voice of speaking for the Communist Party: \"his administration no
longer wants the Taiwan tail to wag the Sino-U .S. dog. Again:
\"Clinton, like it or not Taiwan, has forsworn U.S. support for formal
Taiwanese independence.\" Perversely, the elections Of 2000 are treated
as if they were nothing but the KMT Of 1949. **[The editorials singled
out here testify to what Roland Barthes called myth,]{.underline}**
**[the editorial form conducive to a particular mode Of mythmaking,
realized in proverbial type utterances, or figures Of thought and image
that aim at the uni- versal and \"the refusal Of any explanation, an
unalterable hierarchy Of the world.]{.underline}** \"55 **[They are
prose-myth where the narrative dimension has become a premise:
restriction of history.]{.underline}** Todorov\'s concerns about the
ideological effects of rigid coherence seem confirmed by the editorials.
**[The complex historicity of Taiwan and its conflicts with others do
not transfer into productive repre- sentation for its readers because
Westernization---globalization---makes focus on such local conflicts
only instances Of further pragmatic solutions]{.underline}**. \"**[One
China, two systems\" is such a pragmatic or Western mode Of coming to
terms with conflicted narratives/histories]{.underline}**. In addition,
the editorials belong to prose, myth, and don the mask Of reflexive
speech, **[maxims that \"overlay a world which is already made, bury the
traces of this production under a self-evident appearance \... the
decorous equivalent of a tautology]{.underline}**.\" That is to say, the
ed- itorials discussed above never waver in their commitment to the
rhetoric Of ex- tending some existing facts on the ground, dubious as
history, and as such facts are attached and threaded to the institutions
of this university-based \"PacRim community,\" whose interests are
confused with the public, then it seems fair to ask how such
misfiguration does not convey pure politics, the politics of historical
misrepresentation. The editorials feel aimed at satisfying last readers,
as discussed in chapter I. Taiwan is an island at the edge Of
continental Asia. **[On political and cul- tural grounds---regimes and
resistances, involving the use Of origins and nar- ratives---there is
not any plausible historical argument for One China. One China is a
fiction. It is this fiction that is now nearly impossible to speak to in
the midst of a \"new class\" discourse, since one is immediately tagged
as right wing, antiprogressive, and antifuture if one objects to
American politics and multinational capitalism linked to
Chinese]{.underline}** State-**[Capitalism]{.underline}**, among other
things. But one can resist the associations by suspending \"one story\"
and shift- ing in thought to the Taiwanese---the elections Of 2000 as a
watershed in that it shows Taiwan\'s difference in politics and
historiography**[. Imposed on Taiwan is a \"burden Of history\" that
prevents us from knowing Taiwan]{.underline}**---in Todorov\'s
sense---**[hence from knowing about a specific force of]{.underline}**
dissidence, people not- like-us. In this sense, **[Westerners who
venture to learn something of the pre- sent conflicts between the United
States, China, and Taiwan, might borrow an idea from Jean Baudrillard,
that Taiwan is not a matter of finalities---but a \"so- ciety (that) is
totally there at each instant,]{.underline}**\" 56 Which means: an
affirma- tion of the island Taiwan\'s resistance to history**[. It
should be unthinkable to make Taiwan subject to the failures and power
attacks of the Communist Party of China, as America, even if by
omission, yokes Taiwan to the destiny of American-led globalization and
China\'s Other role, its new submission to the West, becoming
\"us.\"]{.underline}**

#### Capitalism's exploitation of labor and over accumulation makes the system terminally unsustainable---causes structural violence, collapse, and extinction.

**Robinson '14** (William I., Prof. of Sociology, Global and
International Studies, and Latin American Studies, @ UC-Santa Barbara,
"Global Capitalism: Crisis of Humanity and the Specter of 21st Century
Fascism" The World Financial Review)

Cyclical, Structural, and Systemic Crises Most commentators on the
contemporary crisis refer to the "Great Recession" of 2008 and its
aftermath. Yet **[the causal origins of global crisis are to be found in
over-accumulation and]{.underline}** also **[in contradictions of state
power]{.underline}**, or in what Marxists call the internal
contradictions of the capitalist system. Moreover, **[because the system
is now global, crisis in any one place tends to represent crisis for the
system as a whole.]{.underline}** The system cannot expand because the
marginalisation of a significant portion of humanity from direct
productive participation, the downward pressure on wages and popular
consumption worldwide, and the polarisation of income, has reduced the
ability of the world market to absorb world output. At the same time,
**[given the particular configuration of social and class forces and the
correlation of these forces worldwide, national states are hard-pressed
to regulate transnational circuits of accumulation and
offset]{.underline}** the **[explosive contradictions]{.underline}**
built into the system. Is this crisis cyclical, structural, or systemic?
**[Cyclical crises are recurrent to capitalism about once every 10 years
and involve recessions that act as self-correcting
mechanisms]{.underline}** without any major restructuring of the system.
The recessions of the early 1980s, the early 1990s, and of 2001 were
cyclical crises. In contrast, the 2008 crisis signaled the slide into a
structural crisis*. Structural crises* reflect deeper contra- dictions
that can only be resolved by a major restructuring of the system. The
structural crisis of the 1970s was resolved through capitalist
globalisation. Prior to that, the structural crisis of the 1930s was
resolved through the creation of a new model of redistributive
capitalism, and prior to that the struc- tural crisis of the 1870s
resulted in the development of corpo- rate capitalism. **[A systemic
crisis involves the replacement of a system by an entirely new system or
by an outright collapse. A structural crisis opens up the possibility
for a systemic crisis.]{.underline}** But if it actually snowballs into
a systemic crisis -- in this case, if it gives way either to capitalism
being superseded or to a breakdown of global civilisation -- is not
predetermined and depends entirely on the response of social and
political forces to the crisis and on historical contingencies that are
not easy to forecast. **[This is an historic moment of extreme
uncertainty, in which collective responses from distinct social and
class forces to the crisis are in great flux.]{.underline}** Hence my
concept of global crisis is broader than financial. **[There are
multiple and mutually constitutive dimensions -- economic, social,
political, cultural, ideological and ecological, not to mention the
existential crisis of our consciousness]{.underline}**, values and very
being. There is a crisis of social polarisation, that is, of *social
reproduction.* **[The system cannot meet the needs]{.underline}** or
assure the survival **[of millions of people]{.underline}**, perhaps a
majority of humanity. There are crises of state legitimacy and political
authority, or of *hegemony* and *domination.* National states face
spiraling crises of legitimacy as they fail to meet the social
grievances of local working and popular classes experiencing downward
mobility, unemployment, heightened insecurity and greater hardships.
**[The legitimacy of the system has increasingly been called into
question by millions]{.underline}**, **[perhaps]{.underline}** even
**[billions]{.underline}**, of people around the world, **[and is facing
expanded counter-hegemonic challenges.]{.underline}** Global elites have
been unable counter this erosion of the system's authority in the face
of worldwide pressures for a global moral economy. **[And a canopy that
envelops all these dimensions is a crisis of sustainability rooted
in]{.underline}** an ecological holocaust that has already begun,
expressed in **[climate change and the impending collapse of centralised
agricultural systems]{.underline}** in several regions of the world,
among other indicators. By **[a crisis of humanity]{.underline}** I mean
a crisis that is approaching systemic proportions, **[threatening the
ability of billions of people to survive, and raising the specter of a
collapse of world civilisation]{.underline}** and degeneration into a
new "Dark Ages."2 This crisis of humanity shares a number of aspects
with earlier structural crises but there are also several features
unique to the present: 1. **[The system is fast reaching the ecological
limits of its reproduction. Global capitalism now couples human and
natural history in such a way as to threaten to bring about what would
be the sixth mass extinction]{.underline}** in the known history of life
on earth.3 This mass extinction would be caused not by a natural
catastrophe such as a meteor impact or by evolutionary changes such as
the end of an ice age but by purposive human activity. According to
leading environmental scientists **[there are nine "planetary
boundaries" crucial to maintaining an earth system environment in which
humans can exist, four of which are experiencing]{.underline}** at this
time **[the onset of irreversible environmental degradation and three of
which]{.underline}** (climate change, the nitrogen cycle, and
biodiversity loss) **[are at "tipping points]{.underline}**," meaning
that these processes have already crossed their planetary boundaries. 2.
**[The magnitude of the means of violence and]{.underline}** social
**[control is unprecedented, as is the concentration of the means of

intensified]{.underline}**, that is, converted in hot-house fashion into
spaces of capital, so that *intensive* expansion is reaching depths

power and authority to organise and stabilise the system. **[The spread
of weapons of mass destruction and the unprecedented militarisation of
social life and conflict across the globe makes it hard to imagine that
the system can come under any stable political authority that assures

political forces worldwide responded to crisis? The crisis has resulted
in a rapid political polarisation in global society. Both right and
left-wing forces are ascendant. Three responses seem to be in dispute.
One is what we could call "reformism from above." This elite reformism
is aimed at stabilising the system, at saving the system from itself and
from more radical re- sponses from below. Nonetheless, in the years
following the 2008 collapse of the global financial system it seems
these reformers are unable (or unwilling) to prevail over the power of
transnational financial capital. A second response is popular,
grassroots and leftist resistance from below. As social and political
conflict escalates around the world there appears to be a mounting
global revolt. While such resistance appears insurgent in the wake of
2008 it is spread very unevenly across countries and regions and facing
many problems and challenges. Yet another response is that I term *21st
century fascism*.5 **[The ultra-right is an insurgent force in many
countries.]{.underline}** In broad strokes, **[this project seeks to
fuse reactionary political power with transnational capital and to
organise a mass base among historically privileged sectors of the global
working class]{.underline}** -- **[such as white workers]{.underline}**
in the North and middle layers in the South -- **[that are now
experiencing heightened insecurity and the specter of downward mobility.
It involves militarism, extreme masculinisation, homophobia, racism and
racist mobilisations, including the search for scapegoats, such as
immigrant workers and]{.underline}**, in the West, **[Muslims.
Twenty-first century fascism evokes mystifying ideologies, often
involving race/culture supremacy and xenophobia, embracing an idealised
and mythical past. Neo-fascist culture normalises and glamorises warfare
and social violence, indeed, generates a fascination with domination
that is portrayed even as heroic.]{.underline}**

#### Vote Negative to affirm the party -- the enduring political form of communism is necessary to harness a revolutionary mass movement that can not only gain state power but engage in direct act of resistance like break into police arsenals, liberate prisoners through violent protests. Power is formed in collectivity -- the history of communist resistance demonstrates that solidarity is a pre-requisite to producing social transformation. 

**Dean '18** (Jodi Dean is an American political theorist and professor

Colleges; "The Subject of the Revolution";
http://crisiscritique.org/2017/november/Jodi%20Dean.pdf)

**[Who makes the revolution]{.underline}**? Party, class, people? The
one hundredth anniversary of the Russian 1917 Revolution offers an
opportunity to consider again this perennial Marxist question. **[For
some, the question "who makes" is already poorly posed. Processes occur.
Dynamics unfold. Crises develop. Revolutions have their own logics and
to approach them as if they were the planned and deliberate effects of
decisions of conscious agents is to begin with a category
mistake.]{.underline}** But the question of the subject of revolution is
not reducible to an account of conscious agency. So much was already
clear to Georg Lukács in 1924. **[In Lenin: The Unity of His Thought,
Lukács affirms a paradox of revolutionary causality: the party is "both
producer and product, both precondition and result of the revolutionary
mass movement."1 Revolution shapes its makers]{.underline}**. The
subject that makes the revolution doesn't preexist it; the subject is an
effect of revolution. **[Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek further dispel
the fiction of an agential subject of politics. Badiou presents the
subject as a response to a truth-event. Žižek argues that the subject is
a gap, failure, or void.]{.underline}** Badiou gives us the convert,
disciple, militant, or adept. Žižek gives us the Cogito. With respect to
the subject of politics, more specifically, to the subject of
revolution, are these accounts compatible? Is the subject of a truth the
subject as a gap? When the people are the subject of politics, the
answer is yes. In the Marxist tradition, the people are divided and
disruptive, present retroactively in the insistence of crowds of women,
workers, soldiers, and peasants. **[Never the unity of the nation or the
fullness of reconciled society, the people are the subject to which the
revolution attests. Lukács invokes the people in just this sense when he
explains the dialectical transformation of the concept of the people in
Lenin's characterization of the Russian Revolution: "The vague and
abstract concept of 'the people' had to be rejected, but only so that a
revolutionary, discriminating, concept of 'the people'---the
revolutionary alliance of the oppressed---could develop from a concrete
understanding of the conditions of proletarian
revolution."]{.underline}**2 China Miéville's story of the Russian
Revolution brings this idea to life. Miéville gives us a revolution
forcing through what might impede, delay, or derail it. It's a
"messianic interruption" that "emerges from the quotidian." It's
unsayable, "yet the culmination of everyday exhortations."3 **[Exceeding
any party or class that might contain it, the revolution manifests the
people as the collective subject of politics. Revolution shapes its
makers through the effects that attest to the force of the divided
people.]{.underline}** The people make the revolution that makes the
people. **[October Miéville's October presents the actuality of
revolution as an accelerating accumulation of effects: the force of the
many where they don't belong, the breakdown of order, custom, and
provisioning, and the exhilarating push of the unexpected overwhelm as
society becomes nature.]{.underline}** Groups and agents struggle to
steer events -- or at least avoid being crushed by them. Some succeed,
as often despite as because of their best efforts: "the revolutionaries
made slapstick errors."4 **[Neither the best theory nor best practices
determine outcomes, although patient, thorough organizing helps push
them in one direction rather than another.]{.underline}** And even as
the primary force seems to belong to contingency \-- "insurgency has
strange triggers" \-- the open sequence of emancipatory politics
nevertheless admits of another power, that of the revolutionary people.5
The event of revolution is the struggle over and through them, their
struggle. **[Three aspects of Miéville's story stand out in this regard
-- crowds, infrastructure, and division. Miéville never ceases to bring
out the power of masses in the streets. Number matters. At the beginning
of 1917, over 400,000 workers lived in Petrograd. 160,000 soldiers were
stationed in the city. On January 9th, 150,000 workers went on strike.
30,000 struck in Moscow.]{.underline}** **[By February 14, 100,000 were
still striking. On the 22nd, the bosses at the Putilov factory locked
out 30,000 workers. The next day was International Women's Day. Radicals
organized speeches, meetings, and celebrations linking the war, the
sky-rocketing cost of living, and the situation of women. "But even they
did not expect what happened next."6 Women poured out of the factories
and marched through Petrograd's most militant districts, "filling the
side streets in huge and growing numbers."7 Men came on and joined them.
They shouted not just for bread, but for an end to the war and an end to
the monarchy. "Without anyone having planned it, almost 90,000 women and
men were roaring on the streets of Petrograd."8 The next day, 240,000
people were on strike. Number continued to matter throughout the spring
and summer. 400,000 people on the streets of Petrograd in June. 50,000
deserters from the front crowding into the city.]{.underline}** Half a
million demonstrating on July 4th. Although a matter of number, the
crowd's force exceeds it, always giving rise to the affective
intensities propelling revolution. **[The hungry many lining up for
bread at understocked bakeries are "crucibles for dissent."9 Crowds
launch, unleash, smash, and ransack. They block and overwhelm. They
break into police arsenals, take the weapons, and kill the police.
Crowds storm prisons, tear open doors, and free inmates.]{.underline}**
They surge and flock, storm and rout. Crowds are jubilant, enraged,
militant, trusting, furious, incandescent, delighted, demanding,
disgusted. They fill space and can't be held back. They insist, clamor,
and stampede. Crowds manifest as peasants seizing land, soldiers' mass
defections, workers transformed into an armed militia. As the September
backlash sets in, crowds also present as catastrophe: "starving
proletarian communities raged from house to house in bands, hunting for
both food speculators and food."10 **[Crowds bring fire and fury, the
"smell of smoke and the howling of apes," "apocalyptic
nihilo-drunkenness."]{.underline}**11 Metaphor and metonymy, crowds are
the street's growling anger and the city's radical energy. Miéville
attends to the materialities of revolution. **[Yes, the level of the
development of Russia's productive forces -- as with most accounts of
the 1917 revolution, the country's weak bourgeoisie and economic
backwardness do not go unmentioned \-- but also revolution's diverse
infrastructures: trains, railways, tramcars, telephone lines, banners,
presses, and bridges; smashed glass, ricocheting bullets, and bursts of
electricity]{.underline}**. **[Media plays a role; of course the party
papers, but also the telegraph: "with the news of the revolution spread
the revolution itself."]{.underline}**12 Some weapons are "too filthy to
fire."13 Others lack ammunition. A plan calls for a specific signal: a
red lantern raised on a flagpole. It turns out that no one has a red
lantern and once a substitute lantern is found it's nearly impossible to
get it up the flagpole. The signal comes ten hours late. **[Contingency
accompanies the material infrastructure of revolution as much as it does
its crowds.]{.underline}** Political forms are also components of the
revolution's infrastructure. In 1917 Russia, the most famous of the
political forms is the soviet. It evokes a classic Russian peasant mode
of association. It repeats 1905's revolutionary reinvigoration of this
form. **[And in February 1917, it arises from the streets. "Activists
and streetcorner agitators" call for the return of the soviets "in
leaflets, in boisterous voices from the crowds."]{.underline}**14 Signal
and form of people's power, soviets spread virally throughout the
country. The soviet form expresses as well 1917's tense stand-off and
accommodation between the revolution and reform, the Soviet of Workers
and Soldiers Deputies in its relation of dual power with the Duma.
Perhaps the most notorious of the revolution's infrastructure of
political forms, at least in the eyes of some contemporary leftists, is
the party. **[But while too many today present the party as a military
machine with iron-discipline, a centralized apparatus capable of taking
hold of the entire society in a revolutionary situation, Miéville gives
us a slew of revolutionary parties, sometimes cooperating, often
fighting, trying to navigate a rapidly changing
situation.]{.underline}** The Bolsheviks are not even Lenin's Bolsheviks
but rather their own contradictory mix of discipline and disobedience
held together by ideological debate in a political form responding to
revolutionary conditions. In March, Lenin is still in Zurich. Bolsheviks
are divided with respect to opposition to the Provisional Government.
The Petrograd Committee passes a "semi Menshevik" revolution. Returning,
Lenin excoriates his comrades for even their limited support of the
Provisional Government. He rages at the Bolsheviks' lack of discipline.
He advocates moving to the revolution's second phase: no collaboration
with the bourgeoisie; power in the hands of the proletariat and poorest
peasants. Bolshevik support isn't automatic. **[Lenin has to work for
it. He doesn't always win and even when he does the Bolsheviks are often
small presences in the various soviets in which they participate. In the
difficult and confused July days, the party lags behind increasingly
militant workers and soldiers. Stalin drafts a vague pamphlet that
"pretended to a unity of purpose and analysis, an influence, that the
party did not possess.]{.underline}**"15 In September, Lenin is in an
utterly antagonistic relation to his own party. Isolated in his
convictions, his writing censored, he not only disobeys a direct
instruction of the Central Committee, but also tenders his resignation
from it. Like the break-up that doesn't take, the resignation doesn't
happen. The party remains divided. **[Soviet and party are but two of
the political forms providing an infrastructure for
revolution]{.underline}**. Additional forms include other modes of
political association -- congresses, conferences, and committees.
**[They include the police and the military and their different
organizations, some reactionary, some radical. There were the Women's
Battalions of Death, set up by the Kerensky government, as well as armed
Cossacks who refused to ride against the people]{.underline}**. **[The
archive of tactics and when to deploy them is also a component of
revolution's infrastructure: demands, "patient explanation," compromise,
slogans.]{.underline}** **[In this vein, theory is itself part of the
infrastructure of revolution, one of the ways participants make sense of
what is going on and what is to be done]{.underline}**. Miéville brings
outs theory's indeterminacy, the ways it directs its adherents in
opposing directions. Exemplary is the understanding of Marxism as
designating a particular timeline for revolution: proletarian revolution
comes after bourgeois revolution. **[Their theory told supporters of the
Soviet in the early days of dual power that their role was to put brakes
on the revolution: "here was the hesitancy of those whose socialism
taught that a strategic alliance with the bourgeoisie was necessary,
that, however messily events proceeded, there were stages yet to come,
that it was the bourgeoisie who must first take
power]{.underline}**."**[16 With revolution's crowds and infrastructures
comes division. Division concentrates, intensifies, and propels the
revolution]{.underline}**. Such concentration, intensification, and
propulsion expose what appear from one perspective as impediments to the
revolutionary power of the people to be its demonstration. **[Multiple
divisions consolidate into binaries: Soviet v. Duma, other governmental
apparatuses cease to matter; for or against the war, subtle distinctions
fall by the wayside; people v. bourgeoisie, the proletariat's and
peasantry's different interests eclipsed by their common opposition to a
government unwilling to end the war; revolution and counter-revolution
as reactionary forces fight back.]{.underline}** There is even a
concentration of the division between the politicized and the
disengaged. Miéville notes a dramatic decrease in voting between May and
September and accompanying increase in the militancy of the votes cast;
the center cannot hold. Each concentration of social and political
division intensifies the political moment: dual power strengthens the
workers and soldiers represented in the Soviet and weakens the
capacities of the Provisional Government; **[mass desertion amplifies
losses at the front and violence and shortages in the cities; the
economic crisis is inscribed in blood on the backs of the poor;
Bolsheviks are arrested, vigilantes roam the streets, and across the
country arise ultraright anti-Semitic pogromists]{.underline}**. In
July, "everywhere was confrontation, sometimes in sordid form."17
Concentration and intensification of division push the revolution
forward. **[This push is the revolution, not the crowds and the
infrastructure alone but the dynamics that conjoin, energize, and direct
them. A party gives instructions. The crowd ignores them. Parties call
for unity, but fail to find a way to unify. Plans fail. Crowds surprise
everyone with a sea of red banners. Counter-revolutionaries smash
opponents. Revolution pushes forward despite countless impediments,
myriad attempts to calm and contain it.]{.underline}** The people are
the gap between expectation and result, the divisive force that exceeds
available channels. The overcoming of impediments, the challenge they
present and the response they engender, drives the revolution. Events
ignore the hesitation of those socialists convinced that the time is not
ripe for proletarian revolution. **[Their historical anxiety, no matter
how well-grounded in Marxist theory, responds to and is met by the force
of the revolutionary people -- crowds, deserters, rioters, and even
counterrevolutionaries]{.underline}**. The real of revolution breaks
through whether they want it or not. Soviets across the country,
Bolsheviks across the soviets, give the revolution a form by providing
sites that can see themselves as the people. Crowds generate their
affective supplement. Even the divisions between and among the
socialists \-- Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Lenin and his own party --
function as enabling impediments through which to discern the people as
the subject of revolution**[. As divisions are concentrated and
intensified, decisions are made. Which one is correct is determined in
the streets, in the course of its interaction with the multiplicity of
changing circumstances]{.underline}**. Intensification makes some ideas,
some tactics and slogans, better at some points and worse at others.
**[The efficacy of tactics and slogans points to the people as their
cause, and not to the parties or factions that introduce them. Lenin has
to appeal to peasants as well as workers because that's who the people
are.]{.underline}** October gives us October as the event of revolution.
The event accumulates through conflicting combinations of crowds,
infrastructures, and division. **[The force of the people exceeds the
theories, associations, and measures pronounced sometimes in their name,
sometimes to control or contain them.18 From the one side, their
revolutionary force appears regardless of whether it is wanted,
predicted, or authorized.]{.underline}** Its effects manifest with the
breaking through or overcoming of each impediment. **[From the other, it
is the attempts to understand, mobilize, channel, and win the support of
the divided people that present the revolution to itself. The fact of
this presentation, the necessity of mediation, propels the revolution
whether the presentation is right or wrong, accurate or not. The
struggle over the presentation of the revolution doubles and inflects
the revolution itself.]{.underline}** The people as revolution's subject
is an effect of the impediments they can be said to have overcome in
their assertion of their power. Neither audience to action on a
political stage, inert mass set in motion by energizing parties, nor
victims to processes outside their control, the people are present in
the accumulated effects of upheaval that testify to the divided people
as their subject.

#### The alternative is solidarity with the sunflower movement- in resistance to Chinese Integration, Taiwanese activists occupied Parliament for 24 days to demand the review of trade agreements. Affirming the sunflower movement challenges the neoliberal hegemony of the future- refusal to accept the imposition of nationalism and neoliberalism is a pre-requisite to political organization against the structure of capitalism that produce international relations.

**Wang 2017 (**Chih-ming , Academia Sinica - Taiwan, "'The future that
belongs to us': Affective politics, neoliberalism and the Sunflower
Movement," 2017, Sage Publications**)**

Thanks to the tireless news broadcasting and the **[hyper-dynamic social
media that quickly attracted more students and concerned citizens to the
cause and the site of protest, the Parliament turned into a mecca of
activism and a spectacle of political desire, and the movement against
the CSSTA was thus born in the name of Sunflower, echoing the Wild
Lilies and Wild Strawberries movements before it,1 as a sign of hope,
defiance, and courage]{.underline}**. As expected, the government
responded to the protest negatively. **[The police attempted to evict
the students by force, but the students had already used whatever was to
hand to build blockades and assemble their own press center, turning the
occupied Parliament into a combined citadel and a live news
station]{.underline}**. Five days later, in order to press the issue,
**[the more radical students broke through the police who were defending
it and entered into the government's top administration building, the
Administrative Yuan.]{.underline}** **[This spontaneous action instantly
escalated the tension: the police resorted to using water cannon and
batons against the protesters, and arrested several student leaders.
Undaunted, students responded by organizing a mass demonstration on 30
March, bringing about 700,000 people to the streets to press their
demands.]{.underline}** **[The head of the Parliament, Wang Jin-pyng,
known for his political calculation, visited the protesters and promised
that the Parliament would put the review of CSSTA on hold until the
Parliament first legislated the rules to govern cross-Strait
negotiations]{.underline}**. At 6 p.m. on 10 April, each with a
sunflower in their hands, **[the protesters declared victory and left
the Parliament, bringing to an end 24 days of occupation. The Sunflower
Movement has commanded global media attention and provoked analysts and
scholars to ponder why it happened, how to understand its contexts and
creative expressions, and what impacts it might have on democratic
practices, political theory, and cross-Strait relations]{.underline}**.3
While some scholars defended the Sunflower Movement through the
discourse of civil disobedience, **[legitimizing its liberatory politics
and nationalist concerns]{.underline}** (Chen CM, 2014, 2015; Ho, 2015;
Jones and Su, 2015; Ye, 2014), others found the movement's
pro-independence, anti-China, and masculinist stances troubling, and its
uncritical attitude toward free trade worrying (Hong 2014; Hu 2014; Wang
and Hu 2014). Bowen Tseng (2014) observes that the movement contains
four different and contradictory elements: anti-China Taiwanese
nationalism; leftist anti-free trade sentiment; demands for democratic
reforms; and generational justice. **[While these elements are mutually
interpenetrated and uneasily aligned within the protest against the
CSSTA, the last element, I submit, is especially noteworthy: not only
because students were the main force behind this movement but also
because their participation in the events was actually inspired by the
feeling of deprivation at a time when unemployment and real estate
prices are on the rise, wage levels in decline, and upward mobility
through education and hard work diminished.]{.underline}** Tseng (2014)
explains that **[Sunflower students belong to the 'collapsing
generation' (bong shidai) that is confronted by economic crises,
political impasse, class polarization, fertility decline, and falling
wages]{.underline}**.4 'Their discontents engendered calls for
"generational justice" and the yearning for a "youthful subjectivity",'
Tseng argues, '**[this is why the Sunflower Movement could mobilize
students to join the protest so fast,' because 'whether or not they
understand what the issue is, by participation, they already obtained a
subjective feeling that "our future is in our hands"']{.underline}**
(2014: 140--1). **[This observation is important because it captures
well a 'structure of feeling' that understands the Sunflower Movement
less as an ideological struggle between unification and independence,
free market and protectionism, and right and left, and more as an
affective response to the uncertainties of the future released by
neoliberalism. It also shows how neoliberalism in Taiwan is being
understood not only in terms of political economy but also as a factor
contributing to social inequality, precarity of life and work, and class
reproduction, increasingly entrenched and enlarged by the crossStraits
trade]{.underline}** (Lin 2016a, 2016b). Taking its cue from Tseng's
observation, this article seeks to reconsider the discourse of the
future in the Sunflower Movement. **[The 'future' is important not only
because Taiwan has a peculiar 'national' status as hinged on the wind of
the future, but also because the vision of the future is embedded in
neoliberalism as a structure of feeling, or rather as an existential
imperative that compels one to 'invest' in oneself, to compete
relentlessly so as to arrive at a future of prosperity.]{.underline}**
Jason Read argues that **[neoliberalism produces a subject -- homo
economicus -- who embodies a new mode of 'governmentality' that operates
not in the terms of law or rights, but in those of 'interest, investment
and competition' for the purpose of capitalist
accumulation]{.underline}** (2009: 29). **[Neoliberalism is neither just
a political economy, nor an array of capital-friendly policies executed
by the state, but, as David Harvey argues, a 'conceptual apparatus ...
that appeals to our intuitions and instincts, to our values and our
desires, as well as to the possibilities inherent in the social world we
inhabit'; and its concepts of dignity and individual freedom, so
powerful and appealing, have become the 'central values of civilization'
(Harvey, 2005a: 5). Noting that 'neoliberal governmentality results from
the infiltration of market-driven truths and calculations into the
domain of politics,']{.underline}** Aihwa Ong also points out that
**[individuals under neoliberalism are 'induced to selfmanage according
to market principles of disciplines, efficiency, and
competitiveness']{.underline}** (2006: 4). In this sense,
**[neoliberalism is also an existential imperative that hails us into
being, to seek freedom and dignity, not as inalienable rights but rather
as the quest of life. Because neoliberal competition mobilizes constant
optimization of one's skills and resources to avoid falling into the
realm of devaluation and abandonment]{.underline}** (Ong, 2006: 6),
**[the future is uncertain, precarious, and even elusive. It is
something one can look forward to but never hold on to with any degree
of certainty, even though what the future will look like has never been
clearer.]{.underline}** This article attempts to **[address
neoliberalism's future by conceptualizing the Sunflower Movement as an
affective-political explosion of discontents -- not only against
Taiwan's political status quo, but also against the uncertain future
that the status quo holds for them]{.underline}**. By
'**[affective-political,' I gesture toward an understanding of both the
affective dimension of politics as well as the political meaning of
affect,]{.underline}** as articulated by the 'affective turn' in recent
cultural studies scholarship that considers **[affect as 'the
imbrication of the social and the somatic' to capture 'bodies politics'
-- both embodied and embedded -- 'in the production, bypassing, and
surpassing of subjectivity']{.underline}** (Protevi, 2009: xiv).5
Therefore, instead of concentrating on protest events (e.g. Sewell,
1996) or providing an analysis of its organizational profile and
tensions with existing institutions (e.g. Tilly, 1978), as sociology of
social movements often advocates, I focus instead on three Chinese
keywords -- 'Island Sunrise' (daoyu tianguang), '22K,' and 'little
assured happiness' (xiao que xin) -- as affective keys which are not
only well-circulated within the context of the movement but also
indicative of the propensities of its participants for understanding the
social, economic and political circumstances they are caught up in, as
well as their experiences of these circumstances. Together these
keywords highlight an affective cognition of **[the Sunflower Movement
as problematically articulated with/ against neoliberalism. By rejecting
black box democracy, unfair competition, and further integration with
China, the Sunflower Movement in effect refuted the future of neoliberal
globalization as the ontology of being, yet for what futures to come it
knew not.]{.underline}**

#### The political representation of arm sales regulations as "the problem" denies the structural factors of capitalism that produce these issues -- the manufactured crisis of the 1ac is part of a capitalist political process of deferral that sidelines underlying factors to maintain growth.

**[It is not only the South that is reproduced through small arms
control. In the North, a benevolent identity is produced and ongoing
military superiority perpetuated through small arms
measures.]{.underline}** Through their support for an international Arms
Trade Treaty, for example, the UK and French governments -- consistently
two of the world's top arms-exporting states -- represent themselves as
intervening on behalf of those millions of people who live in daily fear
of armed violence. **[Then-British and French Foreign Ministers, David
Miliband and Bernard Kouchner, called the uncontrolled often illegal
spread of weapons 'One of the great tragedies of our time', arguing that
'there is an urgent moral imperative to grip a global problem that is
spinning out of control'. Their respective governments have played a
leading role in efforts at an Arms Trade Treaty which could be a
'crucial step'. This representation of regulatory gaps, a lack of
consistency, and the illegal trade as the problem, which the European
world will manfully step up to try to address, obscures the role of the
legal, state-sanctioned trade, and the uneven development of capitalist
globalization that creates the conditions for the violence conducted
with a variety of categories of arms.]{.underline}** Focussing a little
closer on the UK, its arms control practice features a combination of
concerted action on small arms in tandem with NGOs, a focus on
controlling pariah weapons, and ongoing exports that contravene the
spirit, if not the letter of UK obligations.136 While NGOs, including
major ones such as Oxfam, work in partnership with the UK government,
naturalizing and popularizing particular understandings of the arms
trade, **[the UK Defence Manufacturers' Association, a key industry
lobby group, has come out in favour of the Arms Trade Treaty as a means
to 'crack down on illegal traders and proliferators, and also as an
instrument to create a more equitable regulatory environment for defence
exports worldwide'.137 The association believes that any treaty 'would
not bring new obligations for UK Industry'.138 Any eventual treaty would
thus have no impact on UK domestic procurement or military posture,
while inevitably restricting that of Southern states, whose import
practices would be subjected to scrutiny and regulation. This allows the
UK to remain a major military producer, perpetuating asymmetry in the
world military order, while simultaneously disciplining the Southern
constitution of armed force and seeming benevolent in its concern for
human rights and development]{.underline}**. Finally, it is also worth
noting the North --South relations that are reproduced in terms of the
agents of small arms control. The small arms network began life at the
end of the Cold War as a group of Northern (in particular British and
American), security-oriented NGOs and academics focussed on arms export
controls. Since then, a shared agenda has emerged between states, and
between state and non-state actors such as NGOs, research centres, and
academics. Key states involved in the small arms debate and funding NGOs
include Australia, Germany, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and
the USA. Key NGOs include Amnesty International, the International
Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), International Alert, Oxfam,
Saferworld (all headquartered in the UK), Human Rights Watch (New York),
and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (Geneva). Research centres such
as the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the Federation of American Scientists,
headquartered in Washington, DC, the Bonn International Center for
Conversion (BICC) and the Oslo-based International Peace Research
Institute (PRIO), have been central to the production of knowledge about
small arms. The early movement on small arms was kick-started by a
\$224,000 multi-year grant from 1994 from the Ford Foundation to 'help
build infrastructure for international promotion of the SALW issue'.139
It is important to note that the conflict -- security -- development
nexus is heavily emphasized by some Southern governments and NGOs, in
particular those in sub-Saharan Africa, and that some Southern NGOs such
as Viva Rio (Brazil) and Gun Free South Africa, have been key Southern
influences on the small arms SMALL ARMS CONTROL AND THE REPRODUCTION OF
IMPERIAL RELATIONS 207 Downloaded by \[Tufts University\] at 19:54 06
October 2014 debate**[. There is thus a significant degree of
co-production of small arms control by actors across the commonly-held
divides of International Relations between public and private, and (less
so) North and South. Aid agencies, non-governmental organizations and
research centres from North and South are involved in the promulgation
of small arms control efforts. But within this internationalizing
formation, research, funding and policy initiatives tend to come from
the North, and the vast majority of interventions take place in the
South. Overall, the institutional basis of small arms control is marked
by a distinctly North --South relation which, although actors do their
best to mitigate its worst effects, remains notably hierarchical Small
arms control theory and practice play a role in the reproduction of
imperial relations through the application of Eurocentric categories,
the asymmetry of control efforts between North and South, the production
of the South as inadequate and needing Northern tutelage, and the mutual
constitution of both North and South in relations of hierarchy. Such a
critique goes beyond the immediate policy question of how to control
armed violence in the South, and is suggestive of the generative and
constitutive role of scholarly-practitioner debate about small arms
control.]{.underline}** It raises the broader question of the
international relations that are produced, reproduced and/or challenged
through the debates and practices of small arms control. International
concern with small arms tells us more about the dominant international
security imaginary than it does about armed violence in the South. As
Krause argues, 'Very little, if anything, objectively changes in the
early 1990s,' suggesting that the creation of expert knowledge and
changed normative space were central to the 'explosion of interest' in
small arms.141 While claims of empirical specificity are made in
relation to particular conflicts and countries, and policy responses are
increasingly understood as evidence-based, small arms control can be
understood as a means of producing the South through particular
knowledge practices.142 This means that, rather than a response to an
externally-given policy need, the small arms debate plays a role in
producing this category of weapons as a problem of international
politics. The solutions proposed in this debate are part of the
reproduction of the international relations of organized violence. This
is not to make an instrumentalist or functionalist argument. As
Heathershaw argues in relation to peacebuilding more widely, few
practitioners or scholar-practitioners 'would see themselves as
representatives of the community policing arms of an imperial power',
and scholarship and policy work often 'depart\[s\] significantly from
the territorial and timeless national (security) discourses'
traditionally studied in international relations.143 **[Rather, it is to
make an argument about the co-productivity of academic and practitioner
practice and the power relations that are reproduced through the use of
seemingly progressive categories and concepts. Eurocentrism generates an
inadequate understanding of violence in the South, and inappropriate and
ineffective solutions that are an attempt to build or shape states and
societies in an idealized European image.]{.underline}**

**[Eduardo Valle, former advisor to the Mexican attorney general, stated
in 1995 that the drug industry had become "driving forces, pillars even,
of our economic growth.]{.underline}**"273 **[The US Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) estimates that the illicit drug industry has earned
Mexico between \$30 billion and \$50 billion in profit annually for the
last twenty years]{.underline}**.274 The industry is often said to be
second only to oil in its earning capacity for Mexico; its profits may
exceed the oil industry, but no official numbers exist to compare the
two.275 **[The rise of corporatism in the United States has developed
slowly over time; eventually, the "so-called revolving door" that
characterized relationships between government and business was replaced
by an "archway"; in the context of disaster response, entire industries
have "set up shop inside the government."]{.underline}**276 The
revolving door between cartels and the Mexican state, in the context of
drug trafficking, became an archway in the 1990s, when direct
participation by Mexican government actors in the drug business
accelerated substantially.277 **[Drug cartels function like other
businesses in certain aspects of their structure and in their need for
some level of cooperation from the state in order to prosper. The common
workers in the drug trade, the sellers and smugglers, are largely made
up of individuals with few socio-economic opportunities, who, upon
entering the drug business, deal with an "unpredictable career that
often leads to prison, death, or ruin."]{.underline}**278 **[Trafficking
organizations are at least partially hierarchical
structures]{.underline}**,279 **[and, similar to other capitalist
businesses, the lowest members make relatively little profit while the
upper echelons may accumulate startling levels of
wealth]{.underline}**.280 **[In order to maintain control of
transportation routes, cartels require a certain amount of cooperation
from the police, military, and government officials]{.underline}**.281
The most powerful cartel in a given area receives law enforcement
protection.282 In some respects, local government and law enforcement
may not have a lot of choice in deciding whether to cooperate with drug
traffickers. From January to October 2010, eleven municipal mayors were
killed in Mexico---more than one death of an elected official per
month.283 The killings are assumed to have been committed by criminal
organizations to intimidate the government.284 They likely occurred
either because the local governments began refusing to facilitate cartel
activities or because the governments began to impede the activities of
the cartels. **[Either way, the deaths imply that cartels need the
government to cooperate in order to do their business, and that they are
prepared to obtain that cooperation through any means
necessary.]{.underline}**285 El Sicario, an anonymous ex-employee of the
drug business, maintains that all of the law enforcement academies in
Mexico have been used as training grounds by the cartels.286 Students
learn how to handle weapons, recognize faces, pursue people in an urban
chase without losing them, and conduct surveillance, all of which are of
use to the cartels.287 El Sicario recounts his own story of working for
the cartels from the time he began training with the police, explaining
that fifty of the two hundred students he graduated with were already on
the payroll of a drug trafficking organization.288 The "explosion of
violence" in recent years has not slowed the drug trade. In fact, El
Sicario suggests that "the atmosphere of unrestrained violence acts as a
smokescreen for the real business and that the money flow is now better
than ever."289 Additionally, workers economically displaced in the wake
of NAFTA have begun growing illicit drugs, supplying the cartels with
merchandise. As a result of the free-trade agreement, "\[b\]y 2007 a
kilo of illicit drugs could get a price 300 times higher than a kilo of
maize; a kilo of marijuana or poppies was worth more than a ton of
beans."290 The number of hectares dedicated to growing poppies
eventually outnumbered those which are dedicated to growing maize.291 By
all accounts, the cartels have not suffered in the midst of NAFTA and
the militarization of Mexico's war on drugs, nor has the presence of
narco-corruption diminished.

#### State practices are consistently defined by a protection of ruling class interests -- reforms lend legitimacy to a corrupt apparatus that has empirically refused any meaningful restraint on its power.

**[No one could]{.underline}** sensibly **[claim that these principles
of transparency and accountability were]{.underline}** uniformly
**[applied in the decades after they were first
formulated]{.underline}**. These were promises that the new regime made
to the people generally. **[As promises, they were hedged]{.underline}**
about **[with limitations and conditions at the outset, and then in
practice proved to be difficult to enforce]{.underline}**. **[These were
promises fashioned as instruments of bourgeois state power, setting out
an idea that the state would stand as neutral guardian of principle,
when in fact it was prepared to act as an instrument of social
control]{.underline}**. But **[while the promises could never be wholly
realized, keeping them gave state power its perceived
legitimacy.]{.underline}** **[That]{.underline}**, in general terms,
**[is the way of]{.underline}** parliamentary
**[democracy]{.underline}**. **[Organs of state power remain open to
influence; a set of declared rights is more or less guaranteed. It is
not, therefore, surprising that]{.underline}** Chief Justice Marshall
himself wrote **[the Supreme Court]{.underline}** opinions that
**[denied judicial review to Native Americans and African
slaves]{.underline}**. After all, the Constitution itself accepted the
institution of slavery and provided that: "Representatives and direct
Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be
included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which
shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons,
including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding
Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons." That is, a slave
was three‐fifths of a person for the purpose of allocating Congressional
seats, though without a vote or any of the political rights defined in
the Constitution. Native Americans did not exist for purposes of taxes
and representation, although the Congress would certainly legislate as
to their status. In the early nineteenth century, Native Americans
sought to assert their rights. As I wrote in Law & the Rise of
Capitalism: The Cherokee Nation of Georgia adopted a written
constitution and asserted sovereignty over its land. The Georgia
legislature responded by declaring Cherokee laws and customs void and
opening Cherokee land to settlement. The federal Congress, at the urging
of President Andrew Jackson, passed legislation seeking to compel Native
Americans to give up and move westward. Georgia authorities arrested,
tried, and hanged a Cherokee for an offense allegedly committed on
Cherokee territory. The Cherokee Nation sought relief in the courts.
They were, after all, a nation. They sought to restrain the enforcement
of Georgia laws which "go directly to annihilate the Cherokees as a
political society, and to seize, for the use of Georgia, the lands of
the nation which have been assured to them by the United States in
solemn treaties repeatedly made and still in force." The Cherokees'
lawyer invoked the Supreme Court's power, saying that the lawsuit was
between a foreign nation---the Cherokee--- and the state of Georgia.
Under the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court could exercise
its original jurisdiction over such a lawsuit without waiting for lower
courts to decide it and then hearing the case on appeal. Chief Justice
Marshall looked to the constitutional grant to Congress of the power to
regulate commerce with "foreign nations, and among the several states,
and with the Indian tribes." He found the Cherokee to be "a domestic,
dependent nation" that was "in a state of pupilage," like "that of a
ward to his guardian." It was not, he said, for the Court a true
"foreign nation." Thus, the Cherokee Nation had no legal existence. It
could not even come to a federal court to vindicate its treaty rights.
The Supreme Court decided Cherokee Nation v. Georgia in 1830, over the
dissents of Justices Story and Thompson. Two years later, in Worcester
v. Georgia, Chief Justice Marshall retreated a bit, and held that
Georgia did not have the right to regulate activities on the Cherokee
lands. He did not reach this result by recognizing the position of the
Cherokee Nation, but by denying the right of a state such as Georgia to
interfere in matters that are essentially federal. That is, the national
government had the constitutional power to deal with Native Americans
and the states had only a limited role to play. Marshall spoke for the
Supreme Court on the issue of slavery in an 1825 case, The Antelope. The
Constitution had forbidden Congress to regulate importation of "persons"
until 1808. In a statute that took effect January 1, 1808, the Congress
prohibited importation of slaves. Nonetheless, the slave trade
continued, and in 1820, a U.S. coast guard vessel boarded and seized a
ship, The Antelope, that was carrying 225 African slaves. The Antelope
was taken into port on suspicion that the slaves were destined to be
imported into the United States. Here was a chance for Marshall, who
acknowledged that slavery was "contrary to the laws of nature," to
translate this sense of injustice into a judicial command. However, he
noted that "Christian and civilized" nations still engaged in the slave
trade and that it could not therefore be said to be unlawful; the slaves
were not to be set free but rather returned to their owners. Marshall's
failure to find controlling international law is the more surprising
because the United States had agreed in the 1814 Treaty of Ghent to seek
an end to the international slave trade. **[For Marshall and his
colleagues on the Supreme Court, Native Americans did not exist as
holders or bearers of rights, and the status of slavery was not an issue
that the law could address]{.underline}**. To complete the story, one
must note the Court's 1841 decision in The Amistad. Between 1825 and
1841, treaties and customary international law had shifted the legal
landscape. The Amistad was a Spanish ship carrying forty‐nine slaves.
The slaves took command of the ship, which eventually anchored off Long
Island. The legal proceedings eventually reached the Supreme Court. The
Spanish and British governments tried to exercise influence on the case:
the British said that the capture of the slaves in Africa violated a
treaty between Britain and Spain. Spain said the slaves were property
and should be returned. The Supreme Court argument, led by John Quincy
Adams, stressed that judicial review and not executive branch concerns
should be the guiding principle of decision. On March 9, 1841, Justice
Story delivered the Supreme Court's opinion holding that the slaves must
be freed. Any hope that was kindled by the Amistad decision was
extinguished by the Dred Scott decision in 1857. **[The Supreme Court's
decision that Dred Scott was not entitled to freedom from slavery
despite having been taken into free territory was based upon an
assertion that echoed the rationale of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia.
African slaves and their descendants could not be "citizens" of any
state and were therefore not entitled to be heard in federal court. They
were,]{.underline}** the Court said, "**[beings of an inferior order,
and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social
or political relations, and so far inferior that they had no rights
which the white man was bound to respect]{.underline}**." That is, it
**[was not only the political institution of slavery that forbade
judicial review, but a theory that those of African descent were
inferior beings destined to be ruled without voice as to their
condition]{.underline}**. Chief Justice Taney, who wrote the majority
opinion, and President James Buchanan, who was given advance notice of
what the Court would do, thought that the Dred Scott decision would end
the controversy about slavery. Of course, it did nothing of the kind,
but rather made a military solution inevitable. **[Thus]{.underline}**,
in 1857, **[for white male citizens, judicial review of governmental
action was presumptively available. However, judicial review stopped
short when a litigant challenged a system of social
relations]{.underline}**. The conquest and subjugation of Native
Americans was a fundamental tenet of British, French, Spanish, and then
U.S. occupation of the Eastern seaboard and then of Westward expansion.
By definition Native Americans were not to be considered as bearers of
rights that could be enforced against the state. And Taney's statement
came at the end of a long pseudo‐historical analysis that justified the
institution of slavery as a part of the social fabric. T h e S e p a r a
t i o n o f P o w e r s A f t e r 1 8 5 7 The Civil War amendments to
the Constitution abolished slavery and provided for equal protection of
the laws. It would be nearly a century before the promise of those
amendments began to be fulfilled by the Supreme Court. For
African‐Americans, the Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education
recognized the promise that the 14th Amendment equal protection clause
indisputably made. The Marbury‐Gilchrist‐Burr model, as limited in
Cherokee Nation and Dred Scott, posits a right of access to review of
governmental action. Presumptively, the courts will provide review. In a
narrow class of cases, that review must be obtained through a political
process. Nobody can rationally claim that either of these avenues of
redress is efficient. Most of the significant cases about "rights" have
been brought and litigated by labor, civil rights, and civil liberties
organizations---the cost of what passes for justice is too great for
most people. Of course, **[those who wind up in court testing their
rights as criminal defendants will have counsel provided but the
deficiencies of that system are well‐known. The electoral political
process is dominated by money, and is in many ways impossibly
corrupt]{.underline}**. **[The point]{.underline}**, however, **[is that
the state has]{.underline}** assiduously **[maintained the fiction that
both of these avenues of redress are in fact viable. In order for this
fiction to have any semblance of credibility, the institutions of
redress must be seen to have some utility. The lawyer for the oppressed
points to the promises and principles in the legal ideology of the
dominant class, and argues for their application in ways that may
contradict the interests of that class. Significant victories have been
won for workers, women, people of color, political dissidents, and gay
and lesbian people---in the judicial, executive, and legislative
arenas]{.underline}**. The courtroom battles for these rights produced
significant victories in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, and helped to
empower movements for social change. **[In the midst of these battles,
there were disturbing signs]{.underline}** that Patrick Henry's
forebodings---a President at the head of an army, and therefore
indisposed to heed the commands of a Chief Justice---would be realized.
And what if a President's refusal to "do what Mr. Chief Justice will
order him" was a problem compounded by Mr. Chief Justice's timidity and
moral obliquity? That is, what if Mr. Chief Justice---in the pattern of
Marshall in Cherokee Nation or Taney in Dred Scott---were to acquiesce
in declaring a "no law" zone because of the character of a claim or of
the claimant? In such a case, **[the structure of separation of powers
might crumble, not by conquest---but by surrender.]{.underline}** By way
of example, **[the Supreme Court upheld the internment of
Japanese‐Americans during the Second World War, yielding to an exercise
of Presidential power]{.underline}** that was later held to have been
improper and based upon false assumptions. Some of the Court's decisions
on freedom of expression and association during the Cold War period
failed to respect freedoms of speech and association. Yet, there were
bright spots, as when the Supreme Court upheld the academic freedom of
Monthly Review editor Paul Sweezy. **[The years since September 11,
2001, have witnessed a significant shift in the role of the executive
and judicial branches. In the militarized national security state, the
dismantling of the constitutional separation of powers has largely come
to pass]{.underline}**. We can see how this has happened, as a matter of
state power and legal ideology. **[Two legal devices have been deployed
to shut off accountability for governmental wrongdoing. The first of
these is a judicially created doctrine of non‐decision---the "political
question doctrine." The second is the state secrets privilege, the
invocation of which forestalls all accountability because the rationale
and details of government conduct are hidden from public
view]{.underline}**. Let us examine these in turn.

#### Capitalism's exploitation of labor and over accumulation makes the system terminally unsustainable---causes structural violence, collapse, and extinction.

**Robinson '14** (William I., Prof. of Sociology, Global and
International Studies, and Latin American Studies, @ UC-Santa Barbara,
"Global Capitalism: Crisis of Humanity and the Specter of 21st Century
Fascism" The World Financial Review)

Cyclical, Structural, and Systemic Crises Most commentators on the
contemporary crisis refer to the "Great Recession" of 2008 and its
aftermath. Yet **[the causal origins of global crisis are to be found in
over-accumulation and]{.underline}** also **[in contradictions of state
power]{.underline}**, or in what Marxists call the internal
contradictions of the capitalist system. Moreover, **[because the system
is now global, crisis in any one place tends to represent crisis for the
system as a whole.]{.underline}** The system cannot expand because the
marginalisation of a significant portion of humanity from direct
productive participation, the downward pressure on wages and popular
consumption worldwide, and the polarisation of income, has reduced the
ability of the world market to absorb world output. At the same time,
**[given the particular configuration of social and class forces and the
correlation of these forces worldwide, national states are hard-pressed
to regulate transnational circuits of accumulation and
offset]{.underline}** the **[explosive contradictions]{.underline}**
built into the system. Is this crisis cyclical, structural, or systemic?
**[Cyclical crises are recurrent to capitalism about once every 10 years
and involve recessions that act as self-correcting
mechanisms]{.underline}** without any major restructuring of the system.
The recessions of the early 1980s, the early 1990s, and of 2001 were
cyclical crises. In contrast, the 2008 crisis signaled the slide into a
structural crisis*. Structural crises* reflect deeper contra- dictions
that can only be resolved by a major restructuring of the system. The
structural crisis of the 1970s was resolved through capitalist
globalisation. Prior to that, the structural crisis of the 1930s was
resolved through the creation of a new model of redistributive
capitalism, and prior to that the struc- tural crisis of the 1870s
resulted in the development of corpo- rate capitalism. **[A systemic
crisis involves the replacement of a system by an entirely new system or
by an outright collapse. A structural crisis opens up the possibility
for a systemic crisis.]{.underline}** But if it actually snowballs into
a systemic crisis -- in this case, if it gives way either to capitalism
being superseded or to a breakdown of global civilisation -- is not
predetermined and depends entirely on the response of social and
political forces to the crisis and on historical contingencies that are
not easy to forecast. **[This is an historic moment of extreme
uncertainty, in which collective responses from distinct social and
class forces to the crisis are in great flux.]{.underline}** Hence my
concept of global crisis is broader than financial. **[There are
multiple and mutually constitutive dimensions -- economic, social,
political, cultural, ideological and ecological, not to mention the
existential crisis of our consciousness]{.underline}**, values and very
being. There is a crisis of social polarisation, that is, of *social
reproduction.* **[The system cannot meet the needs]{.underline}** or
assure the survival **[of millions of people]{.underline}**, perhaps a
majority of humanity. There are crises of state legitimacy and political
authority, or of *hegemony* and *domination.* National states face
spiraling crises of legitimacy as they fail to meet the social
grievances of local working and popular classes experiencing downward
mobility, unemployment, heightened insecurity and greater hardships.
**[The legitimacy of the system has increasingly been called into
question by millions]{.underline}**, **[perhaps]{.underline}** even
**[billions]{.underline}**, of people around the world, **[and is facing
expanded counter-hegemonic challenges.]{.underline}** Global elites have
been unable counter this erosion of the system's authority in the face
of worldwide pressures for a global moral economy. **[And a canopy that
envelops all these dimensions is a crisis of sustainability rooted
in]{.underline}** an ecological holocaust that has already begun,
expressed in **[climate change and the impending collapse of centralised
agricultural systems]{.underline}** in several regions of the world,
among other indicators. By **[a crisis of humanity]{.underline}** I mean
a crisis that is approaching systemic proportions, **[threatening the
ability of billions of people to survive, and raising the specter of a
collapse of world civilisation]{.underline}** and degeneration into a
new "Dark Ages."2 This crisis of humanity shares a number of aspects
with earlier structural crises but there are also several features
unique to the present: 1. **[The system is fast reaching the ecological
limits of its reproduction. Global capitalism now couples human and
natural history in such a way as to threaten to bring about what would
be the sixth mass extinction]{.underline}** in the known history of life
on earth.3 This mass extinction would be caused not by a natural
catastrophe such as a meteor impact or by evolutionary changes such as
the end of an ice age but by purposive human activity. According to
leading environmental scientists **[there are nine "planetary
boundaries" crucial to maintaining an earth system environment in which
humans can exist, four of which are experiencing]{.underline}** at this
time **[the onset of irreversible environmental degradation and three of
which]{.underline}** (climate change, the nitrogen cycle, and
biodiversity loss) **[are at "tipping points]{.underline}**," meaning
that these processes have already crossed their planetary boundaries. 2.
**[The magnitude of the means of violence and]{.underline}** social
**[control is unprecedented, as is the concentration of the means of
global communication and symbolic production]{.underline}** and
circulation in the hands of a very few powerful groups. **[Computerised
wars, drones, bunker-buster bombs, star wars]{.underline}**, and so
forth, **[have changed the face of warfare. Warfare has become
normalised and sanitised for those not directly at the receiving end of
armed aggression.]{.underline}** At the same time we have arrived at the
panoptical surveillance society and the age of thought control by those
who control global flows of communication, images and symbolic
production. The world of Edward Snowden is the world of George Orwell;
*1984 has arrived;* 3. **[Capitalism is reaching apparent limits to its
extensive expansion. There are no longer any new territories of
significance that can be integrated into world capitalism,
de-ruralisation is now well advanced, and the commodification of the
countryside and of pre- and non-capitalist spaces has
intensified]{.underline}**, that is, converted in hot-house fashion into
spaces of capital, so that *intensive* expansion is reaching depths
never before seen. **[Capitalism must continually expand or
collapse.]{.underline}** How or where will it now expand? 4. **[There is
the rise of a vast surplus population inhabiting a "planet of
slums,"]{.underline}**4 **[alienated from the productive economy, thrown
into the margins, and subject to sophisticated systems of social control
and to destruction - to a mortal cycle of
dispossession-exploitation-exclusion. This includes prison-industrial
and immigrant-detention complexes, omnipresent policing, militarised
gentrification]{.underline}**, and so on; 5. **[There is a disjuncture
between a globalising economy and a nation-state based system of
political authority.]{.underline}** **[Transnational state
apparatuses]{.underline}** are incipient and **[have not been able to
play the role of]{.underline}** what social scientists refer to as a
**["hegemon]{.underline}**," or a leading nation-state that has enough
power and authority to organise and stabilise the system. **[The spread
of weapons of mass destruction and the unprecedented militarisation of
social life and conflict across the globe makes it hard to imagine that
the system can come under any stable political authority that assures
its reproduction.]{.underline}** Global Police State How have social and
political forces worldwide responded to crisis? The crisis has resulted
in a rapid political polarisation in global society. Both right and
left-wing forces are ascendant. Three responses seem to be in dispute.
One is what we could call "reformism from above." This elite reformism
is aimed at stabilising the system, at saving the system from itself and
from more radical re- sponses from below. Nonetheless, in the years
following the 2008 collapse of the global financial system it seems
these reformers are unable (or unwilling) to prevail over the power of
transnational financial capital. A second response is popular,
grassroots and leftist resistance from below. As social and political
conflict escalates around the world there appears to be a mounting
global revolt. While such resistance appears insurgent in the wake of
2008 it is spread very unevenly across countries and regions and facing
many problems and challenges. Yet another response is that I term *21st
century fascism*.5 **[The ultra-right is an insurgent force in many
countries.]{.underline}** In broad strokes, **[this project seeks to
fuse reactionary political power with transnational capital and to
organise a mass base among historically privileged sectors of the global
working class]{.underline}** -- **[such as white workers]{.underline}**
in the North and middle layers in the South -- **[that are now
experiencing heightened insecurity and the specter of downward mobility.
It involves militarism, extreme masculinisation, homophobia, racism and
racist mobilisations, including the search for scapegoats, such as
immigrant workers and]{.underline}**, in the West, **[Muslims.
Twenty-first century fascism evokes mystifying ideologies, often
involving race/culture supremacy and xenophobia, embracing an idealised
and mythical past. Neo-fascist culture normalises and glamorises warfare
and social violence, indeed, generates a fascination with domination
that is portrayed even as heroic.]{.underline}**

#### **The alternative is a commitment to a marxist revolutionary theory that connects in solidarity with anti-capitalist movements that are rising all over the globe. Building solidarity through different sphere of productions is key -- communism emerges out of the dialectical movement of labour and resistance that continually challenge capitalism through strategic interventions at every level of society. Centering the structure of capitalism is critical to organizing class resistance and building enduring political forms of communism.**

**[The difference between socialism and communism is worth noting.
Socialism aims to democratically manage and regulate capitalism in ways
that calm its excesses and redistribute its benefits for the common
good. It is about spreading the wealth around through progressive
taxation arrangements while basic needs -- such as education, health
care and even housing -- are provided by the state out of reach of
market forces. Many of the key achievements of redistributive socialism
in the period after 1945, not only in Europe but beyond, have become so
socially embedded as to be immune from neoliberal
assault.]{.underline}** Even in the United States, Social Security and
Medicare are extremely popular programs that right wing forces find it
almost impossible to dislodge. The Thatcherites in Britain could not
touch national health care except at the margins. Social provision in
Scandinavia and most of Western Europe seems to be an unshakable
bed-rock of the social order. Communism, on the other hand, seeks to
displace capitalism by creating an entirely different mode of both
production and distribution of goods and services. **[In the history of
actually existing communism, social control over production, exchange
and distribution meant state control and systematic state planning. In
the long-run this proved to be unsuccessful]{.underline}** though,
interestingly, its conversion in China (and its earlier adoption in
places like Singapore) has proven far more successful than the pure
neoliberal model in generating capitalist growth for reasons that cannot
be elaborated upon here. Contemporary attempts to revive the communist
hypothesis typically abjure state control and look to other forms of
collective social organization to displace market forces and capital
accumulation as the basis for organizing production and distribution.
Horizontally networked as opposed to hierarchically commanded systems of
coordination between autonomously organized and self-governing
collectives of producers and consumers are envisaged as lying at the
core of a new form of communism. Contemporary technologies of
communication make such a system seem feasible. All manner of
small-scale experiments around the world can be found in which such
economic and political forms are being constructed. In this there is a
convergence of some sort between the Marxist and anarchist traditions
that harks back to the broadly collaborative situation between them in
the 1860s in Europe. While nothing is certain, it could be that 2009
marks the beginning of a prolonged shake out in which the question of
grand and far-reaching alternatives to capitalism will step-by-step
bubble up to the surface in one part of the world or another. The longer
the uncertainty and the misery is prolonged, the more the legitimacy of
the existing way of doing business will be questioned and the more the
demand to build something different will escalate. Radical as opposed to
band-aid reforms to patch up the financial system may seem more
necessary**[. The uneven development of capitalist practices throughout
the world has produced, moreover, anti-capitalist movements all over the
place. The state-centric economies of much of East Asia generate
different discontents (as in Japan and China) compared to the churning
anti-neoliberal struggles occurring throughout much of Latin America
where the Bolivarian revolutionary movement of popular power exists in a
peculiar relationship to capitalist class interests that have yet to be
truly confronted. Differences over tactics and policies in response to
the crisis among the states that make up the European Union are
increasing]{.underline}** even as a second attempt to come up with a
unified EU constitution is under way. **[Revolutionary and resolutely
anti-capitalist movements are also to be found, though not all of them
are of a progressive sort, in many of the marginal zones of capitalism.
Spaces have been opened up within which something radically different in
terms of dominant social relations, ways of life, productive capacities
and mental conceptions of the world can flourish.]{.underline}** This
applies as much to the Taliban and to communist rule in Nepal as to the
Zapatistas in Chiapas and indigenous movements in Bolivia, the Maoist
movements in rural India, even as they are world's apart in objectives,
strategies and tactics. The central problem is that in aggregate there
is no resolute and **[sufficiently unified anti-capitalist movement that
can adequately challenge the reproduction of the capitalist class and
the perpetuation of its power on the world stage. Neither is there any
obvious way to attack the bastions of privilege for capitalist elites or
to curb their inordinate money power and military might. While openings
exist towards some alternative social order, no one really knows where
or what it is. But just because there is no political force capable of
articulating let alone mounting such a program, this is no reason to
hold back on outlining alternatives.]{.underline}** Lenin's famous
question "what is to be done?" cannot be answered, to be sure, without
some sense of who it is might do it where. But a global anti-capitalist
movement is unlikely to emerge without some animating vision of what is
to be done and why. A double blockage exists: the lack of an alternative
vision prevents the formation of an oppositional movement, while the
absence of such a movement precludes the articulation of an alternative.
How, then, can this blockage be transcended? The relation between the
vision of what is to be done and why, and the formation of a political
movement across particular places to do it has to be turned into a
spiral. Each has to reinforce the other if anything is actually to get
done. Otherwise potential opposition will be forever locked down into a
closed circle that frustrates all prospects for constructive change,
leaving us vulnerable to perpetual future crises of capitalism with
increasingly deadly results. Lenin's question demands an answer. The
central problem to be addressed is clear enough. Compound growth for
ever is not possible and the troubles that have beset the world these
last thirty years signal that a limit is looming to continuous capital
accumulation that cannot be transcended except by creating fictions that
cannot last. Add to this the facts that so many people in the world live
in conditions of abject poverty, that environmental degradations are
spiraling out of control, that human dignities are everywhere being
offended even as the rich are piling up more and more wealth (the number
of billionaires in India doubled last year from 27 to 52) under their
command and that the levers of political, institutional, judicial,
military and media power are under such tight but dogmatic political
control as to be incapable of doing much more than perpetuating the
status quo and frustrating discontent. **[A revolutionary politics that
can grasp the nettle of endless compound capital accumulation and
eventually shut it down as the prime motor of human history, requires a
sophisticated understanding of how social change occurs. The failings of
past endeavors to build a lasting socialism and communism have to be
avoided and lessons from that immensely complicated history must be
learned. Yet the absolute necessity for a coherent anti-capitalist
revolutionary movement must also be recognized. The fundamental aim of
that movement is to assume social command over both the production and
distribution of surpluses. We urgently need an explicit revolutionary
theory suited to our times. I propose a "co-revolutionary theory"
derived from an understanding of Marx's account of how capitalism arose
out of feudalism. Social change arises through the dialectical unfolding
of relations between seven moments within the body politic of capitalism
viewed as an ensemble or assemblage of activities and practices: a)
technological and organizational forms of production, exchange and
consumption b) relations to nature c) social relations between people d)
mental conceptions of the world, embracing knowledges and cultural
understandings and beliefs e) labor processes and production of specific
goods, geographies, services or affects]{.underline}** f )
institutional, legal and governmental arrangements g) the conduct of
daily life that underpins social reproduction. Each one of these moments
is internally dynamic and internally marked by tensions and
contradictions (just think of mental conceptions of the world) but all
of them are co-dependent and co-evolve in relation to each other. The
transition to capitalism entailed a mutually supporting movement across
all seven moments. New technologies could not be identified and
practices without new mental conceptions of the world (including that of
the relation to nature and social relations). Social theorists have the
habit of taking just one of the these moments and viewing it as the
"silver bullet" that causes all change. We have technological
determinists (Tom Friedman), environmental determinists (Jarad Diamond),
daily life determinists (Paul Hawkin), labor process determinists (the
autonomistas), institutionalists, and so on and so forth. They are all
wrong. It is the dialectical motion across all of these moments that
really counts even as there is uneven development in that motion.
**[When capitalism itself undergoes one of its phases of renewal, it
does so precisely by co-evolving all moments, obviously not without
tensions, struggles, fights and contradictions. But consider how these
seven moments were configured around 1970 before the neoliberal surge
and consider how they look now and you will see they have all changed in
ways that re-define the operative characteristics of capitalism viewed
as a non-Hegelian totality. An anti-capitalist political movement can
start anywhere (in labor processes, around mental conceptions, in the
relation to nature, in social relations, in the design of revolutionary
technologies and organizational forms, out of daily life or through
attempts to reform institutional and administrative structures including
the reconfiguration of state powers). The trick is to keep the political
movement moving from one moment to another in mutually reinforcing
ways]{.underline}**. **[This was how capitalism arose out of feudalism
and this is how something radically different called communism,
socialism or whatever must arise out of capitalism. Previous attempts to
create a communist or socialist alternative fatally failed to keep the
dialectic between the different moments in motion and failed to embrace
the unpredictabilities and uncertainties in the dialectical movement
between them. Capitalism has survived precisely by keeping the
dialectical movement between the moments going and constructively
embracing the inevitable tensions, including crises, that result. Change
arises, of course, out of an existing state of affairs and it has to
harness the possibilities immanent within an existing
situation.]{.underline}** Since the existing situation varies enormously
from Nepal, to the Pacific regions of Bolivia, to the deindustrializing
cities of Michigan and the still booming cities of Mumbai and Shanghai
and the shaken but by no means destroyed financial centers of New York
and London, so all manner of experiments in social change in different
places and at different geographical scales are both likely and
potentially illuminating as ways to make (or not make) another world
possible. And in each instance it may seem as if one or other aspect of
the existing situation holds the key to a different political future.
**[But the first rule for a global anti-capitalist movement must be:
never rely on the unfolding dynamics of one moment without carefully
calibrating how relations with all the others are adapting and
reverberating. Feasible future possibilities arise out of the existing
state of relations between the different moments. Strategic political
interventions within and across the spheres can gradually move the
social order onto a different developmental path.]{.underline}** This is
what wise leaders and forward looking institutions do all the time in
local situations, so there is no reason to think there is anything
particularly fantastic or utopian about acting in this way. The left has
to look to build alliances between and across those working in the
distinctive spheres. An **[anti-capitalist movement has to be far
broader than groups mobilizing around social relations or over questions
of daily life in themselves. Traditional hostilities between, for
example, those with technical, scientific and administrative expertise
and those animating social movements on the ground have to be addressed
and overcome. We now have to hand, in the example of the climate change
movement, a significant example of how such alliances can begin to work.
In this instance the relation to nature is the beginning point, but
everyone realizes that something has to give on all the other moments
and while there is a wishful politics that wants to see the solution as
purely technological, it becomes clearer by the day that daily life,
mental conceptions, institutional arrangements, production processes and
social relations have to be involved. And all of that means a movement
to restructure capitalist society as a whole and to confront the growth
logic that underlies the problem in the first place.]{.underline}**
There have, however, to be, some loosely agreed upon common objectives
in any transitional movement. Some general guiding norms can be set
down. These might include (and I just float these norms here for
discussion) respect for nature, radical egalitarianism in social
relations, institutional arrangements based in some sense of common
interests and common property, democratic administrative procedures (as
opposed to the monetized shams that now exist), labor processes
organized by the direct producers, daily life as the free exploration of
new kinds of social relations and living arrangements, mental
conceptions that focus on self-realization in service to others and
technological and organizational innovations oriented to the pursuit of
the common good rather than to supporting militarized power,
surveillance and corporate greed. These could be the co-revolutionary
points around which social action could converge and rotate. Of course
this is utopian! But so what! We cannot afford not to be. Let me detail
one particular aspect of the problem which arise in the place where I
work. Ideas have consequences and false ideas can have devastating
consequences. Policy failures based on erroneous economic thinking
played a crucial role in both the run-up to the debacle of the 1930s and
in the seeming inability to find an adequate way out. Though there is no
agreement among historians and economists as to exactly what policies
failed, it is agreed that the knowledge structure through which the
crisis was understood needed to be revolutionized. Keynes and his
colleagues accomplished that task. But by the mid-1970s, it became clear
that the Keynesian policy tools were no longer working at least in the
way they were being applied and it was in this context that monetarism,
supply-side theory and the (beautiful) mathematical modelling of
micro-economic market behaviors supplanted broad-brush macro-economic
Keynesian thinking. The monetarist and narrower neoliberal theoretical
frame that dominated after 1980 is now in question. In fact it has
disastrously failed. We need new mental conceptions to understand the
world. What might these be and who will produce them, given both the
sociological and intellectual malaise that hangs over knowledge
production and (equally important) dissemination more generally? The
deeply entrenched mental conceptions associated with neoliberal theories
and the neoliberalization and corporatization of the universities and
the media has played more than a trivial role in the production of the
present crisis. For example, the whole question of what to do about the
financial system, the banking sector, the state-finance nexus and the
power of private property rights, cannot be broached without going
outside of the box of conventional thinking**[. For this to happen will
require a revolution in thinking, in places as diverse as the
universities, the media and government as well as within the financial
institutions themselves. Karl Marx, while not in any way inclined to
embrace philosophical idealism, held that ideas are a material force in
history. Mental conceptions constitute, after all, one of the seven
moments in his general theory of co-revolutionary change.]{.underline}**

#### The history of the Israel-Palestine conflict cannot be understood outside the context of global capitalism -- a historical Marxist analysis is critical to re-conceptualize the political approach towards Palestinian liberation. The framing of nation and religion as the core of the struggle neglects the necessity of class to the formation of the violent social relations that situate the conflict.

**Nir and Wainwright 2018 (**Oded, assistant professor at Vassar
college, Joel, professor at Ohio State, "Where Is the Marxist Critique
of Israel/Palestine", Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

And at the heart of these conflicts lies the Israeli occupation of
Palestine. The Palestinians continue to be ground down by the Israeli
state, which (notwithstanding Netanyahu's present political troubles) is
firmly held by the Right; there is no significant political Left
(Marxist or not) to speak of on either side. The only meaning of the
so-called "peace process" is to provide the Israeli state with cover as
it continues to extend its domination over the Palestinians. Walls and
settlements continue to spread across the West Bank; Gaza is an open
prison. The seventieth anniversary of the Nakba has been marked by new
mass evictions in the West Bank (Gordon 2018) while IDF soldiers shoot
hundreds of protesters in Gaza (Cockburn 2018) and the United States has
moved its embassy to Jerusalem (Holmes 2018). Across the region, elites
exploit the Palestinian cause for opportunistic legitimation, but this
results in nothing concrete for the Palestinian people. **[One of the
many tragic results of the present crisis is that the situation in
Palestine props up a variety of authoritarian neoliberal
states.]{.underline}** In the face of the present crisis, one might
expect a plethora of Marxist analyses of Israel and Palestine. But, in
fact, there are few. It is a striking lacuna.2 In fairness, there are
stacks of books by left-wing critics of Israel (e.g., Abunimah 2014) and
some brilliant critical analysis of Zionism (e.g., Rose 2005; Butler
2012). One explanation for this lacunae---offered by Chomsky; see the
interview in this issue---is **[that there are practically no Marxists
active in U.S. universities anymore.]{.underline}** Professor Chomsky
has a point, but **[this gap goes beyond the United States, and there
are still Marxists criticizing Israel and/or Zionism both in the United
States and elsewhere. Yet when they have done so, it is almost
exclusively by criticizing the violent colonization of Palestine and
emphasizing the ethical rather than the systemic nature of this
process.]{.underline}** To make a generalization, in the literature on
Israel and Palestine in English, there are hardly any studies of class,
relations of production, or the relationship between the political and
economic balance of forces over time, and so on. Naturally, there are
exceptions, but they illuminate the norm. The failure in this respect of
the journal Rethinking Marxism is symptomatic. From a search of the
journal's digital archive of three decades, RM has published practically
nothing on Palestine and Israel.3 Our basic contention is that **[a
renewed Marxist position is necessary because the political situation is
dire and the existing framework for explaining it is ineffectual.
Marxism is essential because it is the only mode of social and political
analysis capable of grasping capital, nation, and state
synthetically.]{.underline}**4 One of our aims is to theorize this lack:
that is, to explain why there is no Marxist analysis. The result of the
political bankruptcy of the liberal Israeli position is the nightmare of
today: perpetual conflict, suffering Palestinians, futureless Israelis.
The articulation of a robust leftist position is essential. To
generalize in didactic and simplistic terms**[, the Left has framed the
conflict in terms of nation and religion]{.underline}**---Israeli/Jew
versus Palestinian/Muslim---**[leaving class and capital aside. The
political situation is thus domesticated into familiar categories that
leave only one imaginable solution: two separate states]{.underline}**.
Even if this position was once valid, the territorial basis for a
Palestinian state has been systematically destroyed by the Israeli state
through the construction of walls, barriers, highways, checkpoints, and
other apparatuses of colonization (Weizman 2007; cf., Tartir 2015).
Facing these conditions, to chant demands for a Palestinian state
reflects either bad faith or a hypocritical false optimism.
**[Recognizing the absence of a two-state solution]{.underline}**, we
contend, **[should compel us to rethink Israel/Palestine though
categories that cut across national lines. This is where a Marxist
analysis of history, class, and capitalist political economy is crucial.
The aim is to grasp Israel/Palestine as a part of a contradictory unity,
a differentiated totality, within a world wracked by severe
political-economic crises. This implies presenting both diachronic and
synchronic alternatives that try to understand each detail within a
contradictory totality. The notion of contradictory totality is already
implied by the bifurcated object---"Israel/Palestine"---that we have
become accustomed to name the problem]{.underline}**. But does
Israel/Palestine constitute a socioeconomic whole? Certainly not.
**[Grasping this contradictory totality requires, inter alia, studying
the formation of capitalist social relations in
Palestine.]{.underline}**5 A robust literature examines the
political-economic dimensions of Israel and the occupation of
Palestine.6 These and other non-Marxist works lay the critical
foundation for a Marxist interpretation of Israel/Palestine as both a
specific, constantly changing economic-geographical region and a
capitalist society in which the "ordinary" qualities of bourgeois
society express unusual characteristics. Consider the market for labor
power. Some Palestinians remain proletarians for Israeli capitalism. But
since the early 1990s, "foreign" labor has largely substituted for
Palestinian labor, a trend strongly encouraged by the Israeli government
(Kemp and Raijman 2008). A 2011 ILO report observes that during the
1990s "a major influx of foreign workers \[entered Israel\] as
substitute for Arab workers from the Palestinian Authority. Many of
these foreign workers were illegal and did not possess proper government
permits. Many businesses employed foreign laborers in sub-par
conditions, denying them basic rights and lowering wages and benefits"
(Nathanson 2011, 32). Israeli capital is simply not dependent on
Palestinian labor power. By implication, strikes by Palestinian labor
cannot play the role that strikes played in the confrontation with South
African apartheid (Chomsky 2015, 72--6). Thus, **[observed geographical
and juridical contiguities are misleading: the causes of the
Palestinians becoming surplus population are to be sought in the
dynamics of global capitalism]{.underline}**. The same could be said for
the real-estate bubble currently propelling the Israeli urban economy
(Cohen 2017). This is not to deny that the Israeli state bears
responsibility for the Palestinians' plight; rather **[it is to recall
that we must situate the Israeli state and society within global
capitalism if we seek to understand it]{.underline}**.7 Among other
things, **[this requires rejecting one of the most problematic claims
concerning Israel/Palestine sometimes heard on the left: the
mystification of the Israeli oppression of Palestinians via the
conversion of violence into "spirit"]{.underline}** ("the occupation
corrupts"). This liberal formula should be demystified. **[The only
system that unifies both arenas---the internal social one and the
external national one---is capitalism. The liberal tendency to frame the
conflict in religious terms (Jews versus Muslims) is symptomatic of the
disavowal of confronting capital.]{.underline}**

#### BDS needs to be contextualized to an international analysis of class and power- despite success in raising awareness BDS relies on an imperialist system to resolve imperialism which denies radical liberation. Affirming sanctions as a tool mystifies causes of Palestinian suffering and legitimizes intra state violence and colonialism.

**Sperber 2015 (**Joshua, researcher in department of political science
and history at Averrett University, "BDS, Israel, and the World System",
published in institute for Palestine studies vol.45 no.1, autumn**)**

However, with exceptions, \[20\] **[Left analyses of Israel that employ
radical political economy are relatively rare. Many Left accounts of
Israel in fact exchange political-economic analyses for
political-cultural ones]{.underline}**, stressing, for instance, the
special, rather than general nationalistic, character of Zionism. Such
accounts often invoke Israeli polls demonstrating the Israeli public's
support for Israel's wars, as if Israeli jingoism is exceptional and as
if common Israelis decide, rather than merely justify, state policy.
\[21\] Relatedly, many Left accounts **[rely on liberal pluralist
arguments in order to focus,]{.underline}** like Mearsheimer and Walt,
**[on the Israel lobby]{.underline}**. For instance, prolific Marxist
writer Paul Street, who has elsewhere subjected the United States to
withering anticapitalist critique, has complained that the bulk of the
U.S. establishment is held "captive to the savage racist and sociopathic
occupation and mass-murder state Israel has become." \[22\] Thus,
**[when Left critics of Israel do address economics, they typically do
so by isolating the role of the Israel lobby rather than by examining
Israel's place in the international economy]{.underline}**. Such
accounts emphasize that the Israel lobby functions through amassing
enormously concentrated wealth that it channels into an increasingly
unregulated electoral system. However, it is merely presupposed that the
huge investors constituting the Israel lobby are primarily motivated by
national or religious affinity for Israel (if not so-called dual
loyalties), rather than the self-interest that enabled these individuals
to amass such wealth in the first place. As Michael Massing notes, the
key individuals driving the Israel lobby represent a remarkably wealthy
and minuscule fraction of U.S. Jews, who are not only far richer but
also far more hawkish on Israel than the U.S. Jewish population in
general. \[23\] **[A key factor influencing support for Israel, then, is
not merely whether you are Jewish]{.underline}** (Christian Zionists
also support Israel, with a significantly different religious-political
agenda) **[but whether you are wealthy.]{.underline}** **[Any analysis
of U.S. support for Israel, including the machinations of the Israel
lobby, therefore]{.underline}** **[needs to also situate Israel within a
global political-economic process based on the needs and demands of
investors.]{.underline}** The most prominent example of contemporary
Left criticism of Israel is of course BDS itself. BDS, which reflects
the work of sincere, devoted, and at times courageous activists, should
be credited for raising awareness of Israel's abuse of Palestinians. But
**[BDS, which looks to an imperialist system to resolve problems that
imperialism has produced, is neither radical nor
liberatory.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[BDS supporters demonstrate a
fundamental weakness in their position when they are unable to
adequately answer why, given that Israeli violence is contingent upon
U.S. support, BDS doesn't oppose the United States
itself?]{.underline}** \[24\] The answer, reflecting political impotence
that should be interrogated rather than accommodated, is that those who
support peace and justice do not have the power to make the United
States do what they want. **[Instead of addressing the implications of
this reality, however, BDS advocates either blame their powerlessness on
the Israel lobby or sidestep the question of their powerlessness
altogether, ultimately proceeding by ignoring the United States and
targeting its Israeli client.]{.underline}** \[25\] But if activists are
powerless against the U.S. patron, what makes them believe that it is
worthwhile to exert power against the Israeli client? Clients, the
history of the modern Middle East demonstrates, can be replaced.
Moreover, **[targeting Israel (the client) instead of the United States
(the patron) mystifies the source, and purpose, of the power that
activists ostensibly seek to challenge; the problems in the Middle East
did not begin with the creation of Israel and would hardly cease with
its disappearance.]{.underline}** And considering that U.S.-based BDS
activists are so powerless against their own state---the oldest living
democracy, after all---why should Palestinians be encouraged to create
one of their own? It is significant that many U.S. leftists, who rightly
condemn their own society's violence and poverty, and who have recently
witnessed their government's brutal protection of the status quo during
the coordinated police actions that crushed the Occupy Wall Street
movement, deem good enough for Palestinians what they themselves are
compelled to protest. **[It is similarly significant that BDS attempts
to wield sanctions, a form of "soft power" that states use to bend other
states to their will, against Israel. For sanctions to become something
other than a mere moral position, they require states to enforce
them.]{.underline}** But under what circumstances would, say, the United
States or United Kingdom apply sanctions against Israel? Do BDS
supporters really believe that the Obama administration shares their
moral concerns about Palestinian suffering? What does it imply that
sanctions, taken to their logical conclusion, promote a role reversal in
which the Palestinian Authority (PA) would become a U.S. proxy and
Israel would become a sanctioned "rogue state"? **[And as long as
sanctions are "an essential part of demonstrating disapproval," \[26\]
why not express this disapproval in a manner that does not invoke and
thereby reinforce the international system of which the Israel-Palestine
catastrophe is but a part?]{.underline}**

#### Their recognition of Israel as a Settler-Colonial state is not a new insight but a limited theoretical turn that denies the evolution of neoliberalism in the globalization of imperial violence. The policing and expansion in the west bank and gaza characteristic of their impact claims is not a racial strategy of dispossession but a neoliberal spatial fix to respond to the contractions of capitalism's contradictions. 

**Nir and Wainwright 2018 (**Oded, assistant professor at Vassar
college, Joel, professor at Ohio State, "Where Is the Marxist Critique
of Israel/Palestine", Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

To be sure, **[Israel is a settler-colonial state, yet recognizing this
is insufficient for grasping the valences of the present
conflict]{.underline}**. This important point was established clearly in
the 1960s by an anti-Stalinist Marxist organization in Israel (and
journal by the same name), Matzpen. The four basic elements of Matzpen's
analysis in the 1960s are elegantly summarized by one of its leading
theorists, Moshé Machover (2012, x--xi), in the preface to his collected
writings. The first point is, "**[1. Zionism is a colonizing project,
and Israel, its embodiment, is a settler state]{.underline}**." The
other three claims differ from many mainstream leftist analyses and bear
consideration today: **[2. Zionist colonization]{.underline}** belongs
to a different species from, for example, that of South Africa ...
**[rather than being based on exploiting the labor power of the
indigenous people, it sought to exclude and eliminate them;
3.]{.underline}** We insisted on the regional context of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict ... the **[balance of power is heavily
tilted in favor of Israel (backed by its imperialist sponsor \[the
USA\]) ... This imbalance could only be redressed ... as part of a
revolutionary transformation of the region ...]{.underline}** ;
**[4.]{.underline}** Our regional view ... applied not only to the
process whereby it would be resolved but also extended to the form of
the resolution itself. Unlike almost all who addressed the issue,14 we
did not believe that a resolution would occur within the confines of
Palestine ... Thus, we did not advocate a so-called two-state solution
in a repartitioned Palestine, nor a "one-state solution" in a unitary
Palestine. Instead, **[we envisaged incorporation of the two national
groups ... as units with equal rights within a socialist regional union
or federation of the Arab East.]{.underline}** Matzpen's analysis
remained relatively marginal within Israel-Palestine and in
international Marxism. We should recover these insights and bring them
up to date in light of the changes in capitalism (accounting, e.g., for
the neoliberal turn and present global crisis) as well as international
political dynamics (the maturation and declining hegemony of U.S.
imperialism). **[From the Matzpen perspective, then, the central point
of post-Zionism---Israel is a settler-colonial state---is old news,
delivered without sufficient depth of analysis. Yet it should be clear
that for all of Matzpen's appeal to a utopian socialist future, its
analysis remains a non-Marxist one; it stops short of relating the
analysis of political relations to the contradictions of
capitalism.]{.underline}** Instructive in this vein is the introduction
to the 1999 edition of Peace, Peace, When There Is No Peace, originally
published in 1961 (Machover and Orr 1999). In the new
introduction---absent from the book's English translation---the authors
report that, in the time that elapsed between 1961 and 1999, they have
changed their minds about how they view Zionism: while before they saw
Zionism as a movement pitted against British imperialism, now they see
Zionism as simply part of the colonial project. The missing term here is
the post-Zionist revision of the history of Zionism, a line that Matzpen
joined somewhat belatedly with this new introduction.15 **[The
insufficiency of the settler-colonial framework is also clear in the
case of Ilan Pappé]{.underline}**. Pappé (2017, 13) writes that "the
tale of Palestine from the beginning until today is a simple story of
colonialism and dispossession, yet the world treats it as a multifaceted
and complex story---hard to understand and even harder to solve." Since,
from the vantage of its victims, colonialism is a tale of loss,
violence, and violation, he is certainly right. Yet from the vantage of
all those who would struggle for justice, collectivity, and another
future, Pappé's claim is facile. There has never been, from this
vantage, "a simple story of colonialism and dispossession." Like
Tolstoy's unhappy families, **[the conditions of each colonial society
are particular; the specific complexities that comprise them matter for
those who wish to produce alternative worlds.]{.underline}** One recent
non-Marxist statement of this principal is provided by Rachel Busbridge
(2018, 110). **[Busbridge contends that defining Israel as a
settler-colonial state "promises to rejuvenate the Palestinian struggle
under the prescriptive banner of decolonization," yet "this is where the
most strident limitations of the settler-colonial paradigm come into
view, due to, at best, underdeveloped reflection on the possibilities
and practicalities of decolonization and, at worst, connotations
deriving from its contextual point of origin flattening out important
local historical and socio-political specificities."]{.underline}**
Attentiveness to particularity requires historicizing Zionism anew.
Zionism emerged in the nineteenth century as a utopian politics aiming
for the liberation of a subaltern transnational proletariat through the
formation of a new society. To appreciate the tragedy and prospects for
change in Israel and Palestine, **[it will be insightful to consider
Zionism as a failed project of collective liberation. The realization of
this political movement through the colonization of Palestine and the
reorganization of Zionist society as a capitalist nation-state signaled
the end of the utopian element.]{.underline}** Any sophisticated Marxist
insists that **[history's march requires constant renarration. Only
through the efforts of renarration are we able to represent the present
as a space of collective historical practice, as a space in which the
tensions of everchanging subjective experience point toward objective
systemic contradictions as a space of struggle over the
future]{.underline}**. For instance, the debates within the Marxist Left
over the legacies of the 1968 revolts attest precisely to the continuous
need to renarrate history as borne by history's movement itself**[. Yet
when the political Left---including many Marxists---address Israel and
Zionism, the commitment to renarrating history weakens.]{.underline}**
The same narratives are repeated with little variation: Zionism is seen
as a colonial movement that has expropriated Palestinian land, and the
state of Israel is seen as a direct continuation of this history,
oppressing, dispossessing, and exploiting the Palestinians. To explore
new historical narratives of Israel and Zionism does not mean a
repudiation of these narratives. The veracity of their factual basis is
not questioned here. Nor is there an implied abandonment of the ethical
stance immanent to this historical account, that of an uncompromising
demand for justice for the Palestinians**[.]{.underline}** Rather than
opposing these historical accounts, a commitment to narrating this
history anew can translate it into a political project that resonates
more strongly with popular concerns and contemporary realities. **[Yet
for those who are committed to a Marxist perspective, our call to
historicize post-Zionism and renarrate the history of Zionism may cause
disorientation: a troubling of one's political allegiances, a threat of
losing one's political bearings. For post-Zionism was at its most
influential precisely at the same time that the neoliberal
transformation of the Israeli economy was beginning to take
place]{.underline}**. That both of these elements---**[neoliberalization
and post-Zionism---share a deep antagonism to the nation-state and
its]{.underline}** institutions could be taken as a sign of the link
between the two. **[The material or institutional connection between the
attack on the state and the Israeli occupation has never been very
difficult to find]{.underline}**, even though few scholars have examined
it in any detail. **[The wholesale liquidation of Israeli social
protections and centralized economic planning drove poor Israelis to
live in West Bank settlements]{.underline}**, as Daniel Gutwein notes.16
One implication is that **[coastal Israeli land, on which
state-subsidized agriculture was thriving, became a goldmine for private
capital rent extraction]{.underline}** in the 1980s. But **[the
implications are most significant with respect to the settlements
spilling across the West Bank.]{.underline}** Here is Gutwein's (2006)
argument: **[The settlements project in the Territories and the rapid
growth of economic inequality in Israel have been complimentary
foundations of the social and political power relations that the Right
has constructed since 1977 to secure its hegemony. Regarding the
universal welfare state as one of the main sources of power of the Left,
the Right has used Thatcher-like practices to liquidate the welfare
state through privatization and commercialization of its
services.]{.underline}** Naturally, this policy initially affected
mainly the lower classes. Accordingly, **[in order to offset the losses
it inflicted on its voters, the Right has constituted a compensatory
mechanism by splitting Israeli society into rival interest groups ...
\[and has\] worked to undermine the universal welfare state and replace
it as suppliers of partial substitutes to its gradually liquidated
services]{.underline}** ... \[As\] the universal welfare state was
liquidated in \[the area of\] pre1967 Israel, an alternative sectorial
welfare state was constructed in the Territories. **[The enormous
benefits which the "Land of Settlements" offers in housing, education,
health, taxation, infrastructure and employment, have actually become a
mechanism which compensated the lower classes for the damages inflicted
upon them by the privatization of welfare services in
Israel.]{.underline}** From this perspective **[the illegal program of
constantly expanding settlements becomes an attempt to geographically
solve the social contradictions generated by neoliberalism---a spatial
fix where political economy reinforces ideology. A Marxist view could
therefore see post-Zionism as unintentionally useful for the champions
of neoliberalism and the dissolution of working-class economic
protections while inadvertently supporting the settlement enterprise and
thus sabotaging the achievement of the peace in whose name it was
acting]{.underline}**, as we argue below.

#### Capitalism's exploitation of labor and over accumulation makes the system terminally unsustainable---causes structural violence, collapse, and extinction.

**Robinson '14** (William I., Prof. of Sociology, Global and
International Studies, and Latin American Studies, @ UC-Santa Barbara,
"Global Capitalism: Crisis of Humanity and the Specter of 21st Century
Fascism" The World Financial Review)

Cyclical, Structural, and Systemic Crises Most commentators on the
contemporary crisis refer to the "Great Recession" of 2008 and its
aftermath. Yet **[the causal origins of global crisis are to be found in
over-accumulation and]{.underline}** also **[in contradictions of state
power]{.underline}**, or in what Marxists call the internal
contradictions of the capitalist system. Moreover, **[because the system
is now global, crisis in any one place tends to represent crisis for the
system as a whole.]{.underline}** The system cannot expand because the
marginalisation of a significant portion of humanity from direct
productive participation, the downward pressure on wages and popular
consumption worldwide, and the polarisation of income, has reduced the
ability of the world market to absorb world output. At the same time,
**[given the particular configuration of social and class forces and the
correlation of these forces worldwide, national states are hard-pressed
to regulate transnational circuits of accumulation and
offset]{.underline}** the **[explosive contradictions]{.underline}**
built into the system. Is this crisis cyclical, structural, or systemic?
**[Cyclical crises are recurrent to capitalism about once every 10 years
and involve recessions that act as self-correcting
mechanisms]{.underline}** without any major restructuring of the system.
The recessions of the early 1980s, the early 1990s, and of 2001 were
cyclical crises. In contrast, the 2008 crisis signaled the slide into a
structural crisis*. Structural crises* reflect deeper contra- dictions
that can only be resolved by a major restructuring of the system. The
structural crisis of the 1970s was resolved through capitalist
globalisation. Prior to that, the structural crisis of the 1930s was
resolved through the creation of a new model of redistributive
capitalism, and prior to that the struc- tural crisis of the 1870s
resulted in the development of corpo- rate capitalism. **[A systemic
crisis involves the replacement of a system by an entirely new system or
by an outright collapse. A structural crisis opens up the possibility
for a systemic crisis.]{.underline}** But if it actually snowballs into
a systemic crisis -- in this case, if it gives way either to capitalism
being superseded or to a breakdown of global civilisation -- is not
predetermined and depends entirely on the response of social and
political forces to the crisis and on historical contingencies that are
not easy to forecast. **[This is an historic moment of extreme
uncertainty, in which collective responses from distinct social and
class forces to the crisis are in great flux.]{.underline}** Hence my
concept of global crisis is broader than financial. **[There are
multiple and mutually constitutive dimensions -- economic, social,
political, cultural, ideological and ecological, not to mention the
existential crisis of our consciousness]{.underline}**, values and very
being. There is a crisis of social polarisation, that is, of *social
reproduction.* **[The system cannot meet the needs]{.underline}** or
assure the survival **[of millions of people]{.underline}**, perhaps a
majority of humanity. There are crises of state legitimacy and political
authority, or of *hegemony* and *domination.* National states face
spiraling crises of legitimacy as they fail to meet the social
grievances of local working and popular classes experiencing downward
mobility, unemployment, heightened insecurity and greater hardships.
**[The legitimacy of the system has increasingly been called into
question by millions]{.underline}**, **[perhaps]{.underline}** even
**[billions]{.underline}**, of people around the world, **[and is facing
expanded counter-hegemonic challenges.]{.underline}** Global elites have
been unable counter this erosion of the system's authority in the face
of worldwide pressures for a global moral economy. **[And a canopy that
envelops all these dimensions is a crisis of sustainability rooted
in]{.underline}** an ecological holocaust that has already begun,
expressed in **[climate change and the impending collapse of centralised
agricultural systems]{.underline}** in several regions of the world,
among other indicators. By **[a crisis of humanity]{.underline}** I mean
a crisis that is approaching systemic proportions, **[threatening the
ability of billions of people to survive, and raising the specter of a
collapse of world civilisation]{.underline}** and degeneration into a
new "Dark Ages."2 This crisis of humanity shares a number of aspects
with earlier structural crises but there are also several features
unique to the present: 1. **[The system is fast reaching the ecological
limits of its reproduction. Global capitalism now couples human and
natural history in such a way as to threaten to bring about what would
be the sixth mass extinction]{.underline}** in the known history of life
on earth.3 This mass extinction would be caused not by a natural
catastrophe such as a meteor impact or by evolutionary changes such as
the end of an ice age but by purposive human activity. According to
leading environmental scientists **[there are nine "planetary
boundaries" crucial to maintaining an earth system environment in which
humans can exist, four of which are experiencing]{.underline}** at this
time **[the onset of irreversible environmental degradation and three of
which]{.underline}** (climate change, the nitrogen cycle, and
biodiversity loss) **[are at "tipping points]{.underline}**," meaning
that these processes have already crossed their planetary boundaries. 2.
**[The magnitude of the means of violence and]{.underline}** social
**[control is unprecedented, as is the concentration of the means of
global communication and symbolic production]{.underline}** and
circulation in the hands of a very few powerful groups. **[Computerised
wars, drones, bunker-buster bombs, star wars]{.underline}**, and so
forth, **[have changed the face of warfare. Warfare has become
normalised and sanitised for those not directly at the receiving end of
armed aggression.]{.underline}** At the same time we have arrived at the
panoptical surveillance society and the age of thought control by those
who control global flows of communication, images and symbolic
production. The world of Edward Snowden is the world of George Orwell;
*1984 has arrived;* 3. **[Capitalism is reaching apparent limits to its
extensive expansion. There are no longer any new territories of
significance that can be integrated into world capitalism,
de-ruralisation is now well advanced, and the commodification of the
countryside and of pre- and non-capitalist spaces has
intensified]{.underline}**, that is, converted in hot-house fashion into
spaces of capital, so that *intensive* expansion is reaching depths
never before seen. **[Capitalism must continually expand or
collapse.]{.underline}** How or where will it now expand? 4. **[There is
the rise of a vast surplus population inhabiting a "planet of
slums,"]{.underline}**4 **[alienated from the productive economy, thrown
into the margins, and subject to sophisticated systems of social control
and to destruction - to a mortal cycle of
dispossession-exploitation-exclusion. This includes prison-industrial
and immigrant-detention complexes, omnipresent policing, militarised
gentrification]{.underline}**, and so on; 5. **[There is a disjuncture
between a globalising economy and a nation-state based system of
political authority.]{.underline}** **[Transnational state
apparatuses]{.underline}** are incipient and **[have not been able to
play the role of]{.underline}** what social scientists refer to as a
**["hegemon]{.underline}**," or a leading nation-state that has enough
power and authority to organise and stabilise the system. **[The spread
of weapons of mass destruction and the unprecedented militarisation of
social life and conflict across the globe makes it hard to imagine that
the system can come under any stable political authority that assures
its reproduction.]{.underline}** Global Police State How have social and
political forces worldwide responded to crisis? The crisis has resulted
in a rapid political polarisation in global society. Both right and
left-wing forces are ascendant. Three responses seem to be in dispute.
One is what we could call "reformism from above." This elite reformism
is aimed at stabilising the system, at saving the system from itself and
from more radical re- sponses from below. Nonetheless, in the years
following the 2008 collapse of the global financial system it seems
these reformers are unable (or unwilling) to prevail over the power of
transnational financial capital. A second response is popular,
grassroots and leftist resistance from below. As social and political
conflict escalates around the world there appears to be a mounting
global revolt. While such resistance appears insurgent in the wake of
2008 it is spread very unevenly across countries and regions and facing
many problems and challenges. Yet another response is that I term *21st
century fascism*.5 **[The ultra-right is an insurgent force in many
countries.]{.underline}** In broad strokes, **[this project seeks to
fuse reactionary political power with transnational capital and to
organise a mass base among historically privileged sectors of the global
working class]{.underline}** -- **[such as white workers]{.underline}**
in the North and middle layers in the South -- **[that are now
experiencing heightened insecurity and the specter of downward mobility.
It involves militarism, extreme masculinisation, homophobia, racism and
racist mobilisations, including the search for scapegoats, such as
immigrant workers and]{.underline}**, in the West, **[Muslims.
Twenty-first century fascism evokes mystifying ideologies, often
involving race/culture supremacy and xenophobia, embracing an idealised
and mythical past. Neo-fascist culture normalises and glamorises warfare
and social violence, indeed, generates a fascination with domination
that is portrayed even as heroic.]{.underline}**

#### Revolutionary violence is key -- calls to pacifism in response to the violence of Ferguson is an anti-revolutionary tactic of elites to quell resistance. Their lukewarm political activism dooms marginalized people to a passive accepting of violence -- our slogan shouldn't be "Hands up, don't shoot" it should be "arms up, shoot back".

(and boys) killed by law enforcement since the dawn of the new
millennium. They were all unarmed. The above list does not include the
names of black men assaulted and maimed by police, and is simply just
scratching the surface of the human toll that state violence has
wrought]{.underline}**. Additionally, it does not include individuals
killed by security guards or vigilantes (a prime example being George
Zimmerman's murder of Trayvon Martin). While black men seemingly prove
to experience increased instances of police violence, there are no
statistics to verify this, police agencies (local, state, and federal)
do not generally keep tabs on whom their officers kill, and when they do
the numbers are neither thorough nor are they complete. When a cop kills
a civilian, even if the civilian did not have a weapon, the trend seems
to be that the officer is cleared of any wrong doing, or at the very
most is given a paltry sentence, often reduced once the mind of the
public is turned elsewhere**[. Police killings of unarmed men are not
unique to the black demographic. Indeed, extrajudicial murders---what
most police killings tend to be---occur across gender and racial lines,
though of course Afro-Americans, Latinos, the mentally ill, migrant
laborers, and anyone who does not immediately submit to police power and
authority seemingly bear the brunt of the violence meted out by
police]{.underline}**. One needs only conduct a brief Internet search to
see videos of police in the United States wantonly killing people whilst
in the line of duty. The 24 November grand jury decision not to indict
Darren Wilson over the 9 August fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown
has been met with a mixed consensus amongst people in the United States.
On the one hand, there are those who claim that the rule of law has
prevailed, and that there is nothing else to do. For others**[, there is
a feeling of indignance that has catapulted people into large, sometimes
violent, demonstrations in Ferguson and across the United States. State
officials and political pundits have either vilified the protests or
appealed for some semblance of calm in the wake of the grand jury's
decision]{.underline}**. There is almost no discussion on the
anti-democratic nature of the grand jury process, on Jay Nixon
preemptively calling a state of emergency, or the role that the police
play in this society. **[The focus, it seems, is on the lack of
so-called civility on behalf of some of the protesters. Conservatives
often use racialist, if not overtly racist, rhetoric when considering
what is happening in Ferguson. Liberals appeal to the protestors to
harken to the whitewashed legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and engage in
peaceful demonstrations. The time for peace has passed, indeed it never
existed in this country.]{.underline}** It doesn't matter if Brown
robbed a convenience store, or even if he assaulted Wilson. What matters
is that the case highlights the depths to which the capitalist state and
its police forces will protect their own and attempt to stifle any sort
of dissent. Imagine if Wilson was the aggressor in the situation---which
is more likely than Brown being the aggressor---and Brown defended
himself with deadly force, mortally wounding Wilson. Brown would have
likely go to prison for life, whereas Wilson has been cleared for what
has been deemed a justifiable shooting. And it is justifiable based on
how police operate within the United States: with near impunity. The
violence of the police is almost always defensible in the eyes of the
ruling elite, as evinced by Barack Obama's platitudes to liberal desires
to the rule of law in the aftermath of the grand jury decision. So, why
then is the violence of the protestor so reviled? It is confounding that
the people seem more concerned about the loss of property than the loss
of life in the aftermath of the Ferguson decision. **[While there are
opportunists who have used the protests to their own end, the acts of
looting, destruction of property, and violence directed towards state
representatives is not only warranted, it is necessary. If people could,
they would target the police, but the protesters know that a direct
confrontation (with what is now a military force in this country) at
this time would likely result in their deaths. The destruction of
property in the area is the next best option. And while it is lamentable
that some so-called mom-and-pop shops are targeted alongside the larger
businesses, it is the truly dispossessed, downtrodden, social
ostracized, and oppressed peoples who are engaging in the only viable
option to lash out at an increasingly militarized, bureaucratically
regimented, and authoritarian society.]{.underline}** It is clear that
while the murder of Michael Brown was the catalyst for these events, it
4---GC Advocate---Fall no. 3 2014 is not the cause. The cause is the
decades long, the centuries long, daily oppression people experience at
the hands of the capitalist state. Historically, the police, and
specifically the policing of minority communities in the United States
can be traced to the epoch of chattel slavery. The modern police were
developed from, at times directly so, the ranks of slave catchers. The
racialized policing and subjugation of Afro-Americans and, later, of
Amerindians, European immigrant communities, Latinos and others was born
from the desire to maintain a white supremacist state. It does not seem
as though much has changed in this regard since the defeat of Radical
Reconstruction in 1877. **[The problem with the protestors' violence in
Ferguson is that it is unorganized. If the violence was to be organized,
and the protestors armed---more so than the few that sparingly
are---then the brunt of social pressures would not be laid onto middling
proprietors, but unto those deserving the most virulent response of an
enraged populace. Calls for calm emanating from the upper strata of
society are an attempt to mitigate the popular indignation that has long
been bubbling under the surface of the society. The violence against
property, that is destruction and theft, is only an unorganized form of
something with the potential to be far more revolutionary and inspiring.
To say that an all-out class war is on the horizon would be hyperbolic
at this point, and maybe even myopic, but the undergirding social
structures that position disenfranchised and working class peoples well
below the dictatorship of capital are being pressured, the police being
only one such institution. With increased organization, the Ferguson
protests and riots do have the potential to transform from seemingly
random attacks to ones that aim at puncturing the status quo. This is
not a quixotic notion, it is within the realm of material possibilities,
and activist-scholars should be lending their weight to this and other
attendant struggles.]{.underline}** **[The reliability and social
productivity of voting for bourgeoisie parties is long dead. The
demonstration turned riot, turned revolt, is the most effective means to
bring about a new, more egalitarian social paradigm.]{.underline}**
While the current "unrest" in Ferguson and around the country is
unlikely lead to any revolutionary impetus, it is a start**[. As
people's consciousness is transmuted from subservience to the prevailing
ideologies of the elite to something related to their actual position in
the society, drastic social change will become increasingly
possible.]{.underline}** The death of Michael Brown has spurred this
process and has fomented mass discontent with the government.
Furthermore**[, the events in Ferguson have fomented the most visible
resistance to the status quo in the United States. What is needed now is
to take the next step from indiscriminate attacks to ones directly
pointed at state power as well as at the lackeys and apologists who
allow it to prosper. The transformative potential emanating from the
protestors' violence in Ferguson and elsewhere will not help recoup some
"golden age" in the United States---there never was one---but can
hopefully prove to be the kernel of radically altered social
relations.]{.underline}** **[During the protests in New York City in the
days after the decision to not indict Wilson, thousands took to the
streets empathetically chanting "Hands Up, Don't Shoot!" Some, however,
went even further, shouting the slogan "Arms Up, Shoot Back!" The former
statement represents an appeal to state authorities, namely the police,
to cease its murderous rampage upon those living in this
country.]{.underline}** **[The latter, represents a
challenge]{.underline}**---albeit prematurely and an incendiary one,
given the balance of forces---**[to those that currently wield power,
and have the legal (fictitious) right to kill whom they see
fit]{.underline}**. Instead of attempting to demonize the rioters and
looters by invoking the image and memory of Martin Luther King Jr.,
**[it would be more advantageous for those "progressives" in our society
to understand the Ferguson protests as part of the same genealogy as the
Deacons for Defense, Malcolm X, Robert F. Williams, and the Black
Panthers. What is occurring in Ferguson is symptomatic of the social
dislocation that has been ever present but has yet to ferment. When the
state comes down on its citizenry violently, we must resist, with
equitable violence if necessary]{.underline}**. The attacks on property
in Ferguson only need be redirected for a magnificent transformation of
consciousness to come out of Michael Brown's death. **[If not, then
Brown's death, the deaths of the aforementioned men, and the millions
who suffered and died under the jackboot of state oppression in this
country would have partially been lost in vain. Let us not protest the
protestors, but express our solidarity, and our commitment to their
struggle, which is invariably our own struggle. As we solidarize and
join with the embattled communities in and around Ferguson, let us also
remember to look beyond the provincial confines of our own state and
express solidarity with others who struggle for a more just and
equitable society, be they in Palestine, Mexico, or Burkina Faso. In the
word of the late Burkinabé revolutionary Thomas Sankara, "It took the
madmen of yesterday for us to be able to act with extreme clarity today.
I want to be one of those madmen. We must dare to invent the
future."]{.underline}**

#### There is a deep history of resistance by Palestinian and Israeli workers -- a praxis centered on the connections of labour to the production of society produces political coalition across national, religious, and racial lines. Marxism formulates the logic that situates settler colonial theory -- their analysis however can't reconcile the specificity of class relations in the creation of Israel as a settler state.

**Locker-Biletzki 2018 (**Amir, post-doc @ Concordia University,
"Rethinking Settler Colonialism: A Marxist Critique of Gershon Shafir",
Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

The Palestinian working class emerged out of the Arab peasantry in
Palestine**[. Growing indebtedness and the continued dispossession
forced by Zionist colonization pushed Palestinian farmers into the
coastal urban centers in search of work.]{.underline}** This class was
transitory and seasonal in nature. Palestinian workers retained close
links with their villages and moved back to the land in times of
economic distress (Lockman 1995; Tamari 1982). The 1948 war and its
disastrous effect on Palestinian society also marked a turning point in
the history of the Palestinian working class. **[The mostly falaḥim that
remained within Israel suffered an accelerated process of
proletarianization as large-scale land confiscations by the Israeli
state uprooted them from the land. By the late 1950s, as the Israeli
economy boomed and absorbed the massive Aliyah of Arabian and European
Jews, these workers entered the lower ranks of the Israeli industrial
workforce as part of a new Israeli working class made up also of Mizrahi
Jews as well as the privileged workers of the pre-1948
era]{.underline}** (Ben-Porat 1992). From the time of the Arab Rebellion
(1936--9), Palestinian workers engaged in interclass struggle. In Haifa,
shantytown migrant workers took over the rebellion, deposing the
bourgeoisie and traditional leadership (Yazbak 2003). Consider the words
of an unknown Palestinian Nazareth worker in a 1944 letter to the editor
send to the Palestinian Communist newspaper Al-Ittihad (Arabic the
Union): By publishing my words in al-Ittihad, I do not seek the sympathy
of company owners, since they have proved their desire to exploit
workers ... and I do not seek the compassion of the legislative and
executive government authorities, who have displayed their bankruptcy
repeatedly with respect to our lives and interests. \[Instead\] I'd like
to say to our Arab labor organizations and to Arab workers, to work hand
in hand to establish a higher commission to represent them suitably and
honestly reflecting their own interests and benefiting them.9 This short
passage brings out the fact that, **[by the 1940s, a Palestinian working
class unto itself had been formed, one that was aware of the rise of a
class society with antagonistic relations with the national---that is,
Palestinian---bourgeoisie.]{.underline}** The historical narrative that
I have unfolded here shows that---**[along the lines of division that
Zionist settler colonialism had drawn since the late nineteenth
century---Palestinian and Jewish workers forged their own class
struggles and organizations]{.underline}**. **[As was the case with the
Palestinian and Jewish bourgeoisie, the dividing lines were not as
rigidly drawn as Shafir would have them. Alongside the history of
conflict that settler colonialism engendered, Jewish and Palestinian
workers engaged in interclass struggle against their respective
exploiters--- mainly the British colonial state.]{.underline}**
Capitalism and Settler Colonialism in Palestine/Israel Settler-colonial
theory is a materialist theory with intellectual roots in the Marxist
tradition. However, **[settler-colonial theorists' reconstruction of
historical realities in settler societies tends to disregard the
socially varied processes of class formation and the development of
capitalist regimes. For settler-colonial scholars, the
colonizer/colonized dichotomy overshadows the proletariat/bourgeoisie
dichotomy.]{.underline}** This is evident in the pioneering work of
Gershon Shafir. His rendition of the origins of Israeli society is based
on a materialist view of the way Jewish workers effected the building of
a pure colony**[. An analysis of the history of the formation of class
among Palestinians and Jews alike shows that, while it did not comply
with a Marxist-inspired European model, where labor confronted the
political control of capital, the bourgeois class did evolve and to an
extent engaged in antagonistic relations with the laboring
class]{.underline}**. These developments largely corresponded with the
settler-colonial divide that Shafir portrays, meaning that **[Jewish
workers and Arab workers as well as Jewish and Arab capitalists
generally did not form any major interclass alliances beyond the
national dividing lines. However, one cannot entirely dismiss the
history of Palestinian and Jewish cooperation in the citrus groves and
in the joint struggles of workers from both peoples in the governmental
sector of Palestine's economy]{.underline}**. While this may not have
been the main tendency in a society that was shaped by a drive to
categorize and separate Arabs from Jews, it nonetheless lends nuance to
the largely monochromatic picture that Shafir paints of the history of
Palestine/ Israel. **[The reclaiming of this counterhistory and the use
of Marxism to interpret it within settler-colonial discourse serves to
enhance and enrich our view of the history of
Palestine/Israel.]{.underline}** This rewriting of the colonial history
of the country also includes a reclaiming of the Marxist origins of
settler-colonial theories. Apart from the Marxian elements that are to
be found in the works of Wolfe and Veracini and the historicized
materialism of Shafir, this essay has traced the Marxist
"prehistory"---one might dare to say the unacknowledged origins---of
settler colonialism in the works of Rodinson and Hilal, both committed
Marxists. **[Scholars have challenged settler colonialism from differing
points of view, raising concerns about the validity of settler
colonialism as a concept, its overemphasis on the colonizer experience,
the economistic and materialist stress of Shafir's theories, and mainly
the lack of specificity of applying the paradigm to local historical and
social conditions]{.underline}**. This essay takes on some of these
critics---mainly regarding the myopic look at local circumstances. It
attempts to include the history of the rise of capitalist class society
within the settler-colonial history of Palestine/Israel. The history of
Palestine/Israel has been reconstructed from a neo-Marxist and various
other sociological perspectives; however, this essay suggests a
different theoretical meeting point. It suggests **[we should understand
settler colonialism from less of a clear-cut vantage point that shows
the cleavages of class in both the settler and the colonized societies
and the social struggles they induce---struggles that at times blur and
defy the colonial divide that nationalist establishments wish to
reinforce and exploit]{.underline}**. As the conflict between Israelis
and Palestinians originating in late-nineteenth- century Zionism stands
at a bloody impasse, we should seek its beginnings along the critique
that Marxism offers. It must be said **[that beyond the analytical tools
the Marxist tradition can afford us, its emancipatory content can give
us hope.]{.underline}**

**[neoliberalism]{.underline}** has **[facilitated a more permissive
approach to arms trans- fer regulation, then this raises the question of
why any limits have been introduced at all]{.underline}**. As noted
above, one part of **[the answer is rooted in the relationship between
legitimized and heroic weapons and those military technologies that lie
outside the boundaries of the heroic and the legiti-
mized]{.underline}**; being the "other" of legitimized military
technology facilitates successful problematization. Additionally
however, **[the architecture of global arms trade regula- tion has been
transformed]{.underline}** in the post--Cold War era **[along with the
trans- formation in the objects of security]{.underline}** that
accompanied the transition from Cold War to post--Cold War. As noted
above, the former era was character- ized by the virtual absence of
formal international regulation while Cold War security logic also
justified the extensive provision of arms to allies. However, a notable
exception to the absence of formal regulation was the COCOM regime
(Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls) aimed at
preventing the transfer of dual-use technology to the Soviet bloc, which
was also supplemented by severe restrictions imposed by individual
states on defense exports to the opposing ideological bloc.
Consequently, one principal feature of the Cold War era was that the
direction of national and international restrictions on arms sales
traveled along the axis of East-West geostrategic security competition.
Simultane- ously, states were also concerned to manage the supply of
arms to devel- oping world allies. In part, such **[North-South
restrictions simply extended the logic of East-West restraint to
developing world actors perceived to be aligned with the wrong
ideological bloc. The same obsession with deterrence and the perceived
effects of particular weapons systems on dyadic or regional security
relations that dominated superpower thinking on nuclear arms control was
also extended to thinking about conventional sales]{.underline}**. This
manifested itself not only in attempts to manage the volume of arms
supplied but also efforts to calibrate the quality of weapons supplied
to a particular country or region so as not to upset regional arms
balances. Indeed, in a study in 1975, Har- kavy concluded that suppliers
in the Cold War era were relatively less likely to supply their most
modern weapons compared with suppliers in the 1930s (Harkavy 1975, 93).
Even the Soviet Union tended to be reluctant to supply its latest
generation of equipment, and where it did it often pro- vided a
downgraded export model (Roberts 1983, 154--64). Only in the late
sixties and early seventies did this begin to change as economic
problems encouraged states to view sales in more commercial terms. In
other words, contrary to the picture often painted of the Cold War era
arms trade, the primacy given to national security considerations meant
that the realpolitik case for sales was often subject to important
countervailing pressures for restraint grounded in exactly the same
real- ist logic. Although there were notable exceptions, such as
restrictions on sales to apartheid South Africa, **[arms trade
regulation operated principally]{.underline}** as an example of what
Krause (2011) **[has described as a sovereign vision of arms control
that concentrated on one type of violence (that perpetrated between
states) and that aimed to triangulate between ideological dis-
crimination, interstate/intraregion military balance, and maintenance of
an armaments hierarchy by supplier states.]{.underline}** In the
post--Cold War era the focus of regulation has turned to the management
of North-South relations as the developing world has been reconstructed
as the source of diverse security threats arising from weak and failed
states (Cooper 2006b) and as humanitarian intervention has created a
heightened imperative to establish order inside developing states as
well as between them. **[As in the Cold War, then, one function of regu-
lation has been to preserve a military hierarchy that both privileges
the dominant powers in the global system and is a prerequisite for
"success- ful" military interventions under the rubric of the liberal
peace]{.underline}**. In part this has been achieved **[through age-old
strategies of technology denial]{.underline}**. In addition, however, as
Beier has noted, the distinction at the heart of the pariah weapons
agenda between illegitimate and legitimate technologies of killing has
naturalized and valorized a larger constellation of claims to authority
and thus contributed to the reproduction of the ideational bases of the
new way of warfare adopted by Western countries such as the United
States (Beier 2011, 170). Indeed, this particular set of distinc- tions
represents a new variant of the "standard of civilization" mobilized not
only to legitimize or delegitimize specific types of weapons and the
modes of warfare associated with them, but also to reinforce
oppositional identities as benign or barbarian. **[A further function of
conventional arms trade regulation has been to facilitate the
pacification of subjects of liberal peace intervention by reducing the
availability of arms inside states]{.underline}**, par- ticularly to
nonstate actors. In this sense, attempts, for example, to restrict small
arms proliferation at the system level can be viewed both as inti-
mately linked to broader postconflict liberal peace strategies of
security sector reform and UN "disarmament, demobilization, and
reintegration" efforts (DDR), and as descendants of the kind of measures
envisaged in initiatives like the 1890 Brussels Act. The campaign to
promote an arms trade treaty may yet produce a more meaningful
architecture of **[arms transfer control]{.underline}**. However, the
ATT negotiations are also notable for the way in which they echo inter-
war efforts to establish global agreements to regulate the arms trade,
spe- cifically the 1919 St. Germain Convention for the Control of the
Trade in Arms and Ammunition and the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention.
Although neither agreement received enough ratifications to enter into
force, both mirrored the Brussels Act in that they
**[sought]{.underline}**, in the words of a skeptical US official
writing about the St. Germain Convention, **["to diminish the power of
resistance of the natives to the spread and consolidation of the
authority of certain powers"]{.underline}** (Office of the Foreign Trade
Adviser, April 7, 1922). Accordingly, the 1919 convention imposed far
stricter limitations on sales to these areas as well as a ban on arms
shipments to "any coun- try which refuses to accept the tutelage under
which it has been placed" (Stone 2000, 218). **[Indeed, although the
convention never came into force, European powers nevertheless agreed
informally to carry out its provi- sions in Africa and the Middle East
(ibid.).]{.underline}** The 1925 convention similarly imposed more
severe restrictions on exports to special zones that covered most of
Africa and parts of what had been the Ottoman Empire (Krause and
MacDonald 1992, 717). Thus, **[the post--Cold War regulation of the
conventional arms trade is simultaneously characterized by a relatively
more permissive approach to arms transfers in general but also a
redirection of controls away from the governance of East-West relations
and toward the governance of North- South relations. It has replaced the
Cold War architecture of restraint with a new triangulation between
efforts to discriminate]{.underline}** against pariah state and nonstate
actors**[, initiatives to underpin the bio-political
goals]{.underline}** of intra- state pacification**[, and the
maintenance of military hierarchy]{.underline}**. Moreover, rather than
viewing **[initiatives]{.underline}** such as the ATT or the landmines
ban sim- ply as a function of either the agenda setting preferences of
particular NGOs or the specific advocacy strategies of human security
activists, it is more accurate to suggest that they refle**[ct the
emergence of particular sets of relationships between power, interest,
economy, security, and legiti- mized military technologies that in turn
create the conditions of]{.underline}** emer- gence for historically
contingent architectures of **[global regulation]{.underline}**.

Introduction **[The post-Cold War era has witnessed a proliferation of
nonproliferation initiatives aimed at regulating the trade in small arms
and light weapons (SALW).]{.underline}** These include four separate
agreements within the United Na- tions (UN) framework on SALW control;
six multilat- eral agreements, forums, and organizations that address
SALW outside the UN framework; two regional mech- anisms established
specifically to deal with SALW; and thirteen preexisting regional
organizations that have de- veloped arms control-related documents or
agreements (Greene and Marsh 2012, 170--74). Among the most no- table of
these initiatives is the 2001 UN Programme of Action to Eradicate the
Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons and the recently ratified
UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which lists SALW as one of several cat-
egories of defense equipment within its purview. All of these
initiatives have emerged since the 1990s. It is generally acknowledged
that existing literature on **[SALW control is predominantly policy
orientated]{.underline}** (Bourne 2007, 15; Greene and Marsh 2012, 3)
**[and ahistorical]{.underline}** (Grip 2015, 1; Enomoto 2017, 5). Even
when scholars do locate current initiatives in the longer history of
arms regulation, they generally do so only in passing (Brehm 2008, 363;
Bolton and James 2014, 441; Casey- Maslen et al. 2016, 3--4). There is,
of course, a literature examining the history of the arms trade (Cippola
1965; Harkavy 1975; Krause 1992; Stoker and Grant 2003; Grant 2007,
2015, 71--90; Chew 2012), **[but this body of work principally aims to
delineate the drivers of produc- tion and trade.]{.underline}** Of the
limited literature specifically fo- cused on attempts to control the
trade in arms, much of it tends to span many centuries (Krause and
MacDonald 1992; Burns 2013, 80--101; Grip 2015; Enomoto 2017, 3--20).
Thus, most scholars examine the period under consideration here---the
late nineteenth century and early 1900s---only relatively briefly. Even
work specifically concerned with this era tends to focus more on the
post- 1900s period (Stone 2000; Ball 2012; Krause 2017). Moreover, much
of the material that does exist on regu- lation in the late nineteenth
century appears as elements in publications with a different focus
(e.g., anti-slavery, smuggling) produced by historians, social
geographers, sociologists, or economists rather than the arms con- trol
community (Miers 1975; Tagliacozzo 2005; Storey 2008; Mathew 2016). One
way in which this paper makes an original contribution is by bringing
together this fragmented secondary literature to delineate the con-
tours of arms trade regulation in the late nineteenth century. The paper
also makes an original contribution to the contemporary literature on
the relationship between norms, humanitarian arms control (HAC), and
arms con- trol as governmentality. In particular, I argue that t**[he
work of the optimistic school of literature on norms and arms regulation
is ahistorical, tends to focus only on so- called "good" (e.g.,
humanitarian) norms or discrete ini- tiatives (e.g., the landmines ban),
and operates with an inadequate conceptualization of
power]{.underline}**. **[Consequently, it is overly optimistic about the
progressive potential of HAC]{.underline}**. In contrast**[, I draw on
extensive archival research on late nineteenth-century arms trade
regulation1 to il- lustrate how a specific humanitarian initiative aimed
at restricting the trade in arms (in this case the 1890 Brussels Act)
can be conceived as the smallest of a set of three nested Russian
matryoshka dolls of arms trade governance]{.underline}**. Although
principally a multilateral agreement to eliminate the slave trade in
Africa, the act also included qualitative restrictions on the import of
modern firearms into an area extending from the middle of the Sahara to
present day Namibia and Zimbabwe. As such it has been described as "the
first significant multilateral agreement to restrict the arms trade"
(Krause and Macdonald 1992, 712). In part, the arms elements of the act
can be un- derstood as an attempt by both campaigners and policy- makers
to graft a regulatory arms trade norm onto an established constitutive
transnational antislavery norm. Its implementation was more effective
than generally acknowledged. The second matryoshka doll consists of the
broader approach to arms prohibition within which a specific ini-
tiative is located. In this case, the Brussels Act formed only part of
far wider efforts to manage the flow of mod- ern firearms throughout the
spaces of European empires. **[These efforts were driven by the concern
to maintain a qualitative military advantage in what were viewed as
cutting-edge military technologies crucial to the maintenance of
imperial authority.]{.underline}** Thus, rather than being an era of
free trade as often claimed, the period was charac- terized by a dual
regime of regulation: the application of a liberal export norm for
peacetime arms exports from imperial metropoles combined with extensive
attempts to manage arms flows into, within, and between colonial spaces.
Finally, these **[broader attempts at prohibition were part of a much
larger temporally-bound assemblage of norms, laws, and logics that
constituted the practices of arms control as
governmentality]{.underline}**---**[the third matryoshka doll of arms
trade governance]{.underline}**. Arms control as gov- ernmentality
denotes a context where **[mechanisms of proscription and permission
operate as technologies of social control designed to manage which
populations can legitimately use what kinds of weapons]{.underline}**.
Overall, I demonstrate how an understanding of **[arms regulation in the
late nineteenth century undermines the claims of norm optimists that HAC
is inherently transformational and progressive in its promotion of good
norms]{.underline}** and a benign logic of human security. Instead,
**[HAC in the late nineteenth century was consistent with colonialism,
racism, and militarism]{.underline}**. This is not to discount the no-
tion that there are important differences between con- temporary HAC and
its late nineteenth-century variant. **[Rather, it is to highlight the
need for a more thoroughgoing and historicized genealogy of HAC and a
recognition of the "limits of possibility" inherent in the pursuit of
tactical humanitarian "disarmament" without strategic
demilitarization]{.underline}**.

### Arms Regulation Link (Sp2)

#### The political representation of arm sales regulations as "the problem" denies the structural factors of capitalism that produce these issues -- the manufactured crisis of the 1ac is part of a capitalist political process of deferral that sidelines underlying factors to maintain growth.

**[It is not only the South that is reproduced through small arms
control. In the North, a benevolent identity is produced and ongoing
military superiority perpetuated through small arms
measures.]{.underline}** Through their support for an international Arms
Trade Treaty, for example, the UK and French governments -- consistently
two of the world's top arms-exporting states -- represent themselves as
intervening on behalf of those millions of people who live in daily fear
of armed violence. **[Then-British and French Foreign Ministers, David
Miliband and Bernard Kouchner, called the uncontrolled often illegal
spread of weapons 'One of the great tragedies of our time', arguing that
'there is an urgent moral imperative to grip a global problem that is
spinning out of control'. Their respective governments have played a
leading role in efforts at an Arms Trade Treaty which could be a
'crucial step'. This representation of regulatory gaps, a lack of
consistency, and the illegal trade as the problem, which the European
world will manfully step up to try to address, obscures the role of the
legal, state-sanctioned trade, and the uneven development of capitalist
globalization that creates the conditions for the violence conducted
with a variety of categories of arms.]{.underline}** Focussing a little
closer on the UK, its arms control practice features a combination of
concerted action on small arms in tandem with NGOs, a focus on
controlling pariah weapons, and ongoing exports that contravene the
spirit, if not the letter of UK obligations.136 While NGOs, including
major ones such as Oxfam, work in partnership with the UK government,
naturalizing and popularizing particular understandings of the arms
trade, **[the UK Defence Manufacturers' Association, a key industry
lobby group, has come out in favour of the Arms Trade Treaty as a means
to 'crack down on illegal traders and proliferators, and also as an
instrument to create a more equitable regulatory environment for defence
exports worldwide'.137 The association believes that any treaty 'would
not bring new obligations for UK Industry'.138 Any eventual treaty would
thus have no impact on UK domestic procurement or military posture,
while inevitably restricting that of Southern states, whose import
practices would be subjected to scrutiny and regulation. This allows the
UK to remain a major military producer, perpetuating asymmetry in the
world military order, while simultaneously disciplining the Southern
constitution of armed force and seeming benevolent in its concern for
human rights and development]{.underline}**. Finally, it is also worth
noting the North --South relations that are reproduced in terms of the
agents of small arms control. The small arms network began life at the
end of the Cold War as a group of Northern (in particular British and
American), security-oriented NGOs and academics focussed on arms export
controls. Since then, a shared agenda has emerged between states, and
between state and non-state actors such as NGOs, research centres, and
academics. Key states involved in the small arms debate and funding NGOs
include Australia, Germany, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and
the USA. Key NGOs include Amnesty International, the International
Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), International Alert, Oxfam,
Saferworld (all headquartered in the UK), Human Rights Watch (New York),
and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (Geneva). Research centres such
as the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the Federation of American Scientists,
headquartered in Washington, DC, the Bonn International Center for
Conversion (BICC) and the Oslo-based International Peace Research
Institute (PRIO), have been central to the production of knowledge about
small arms. The early movement on small arms was kick-started by a
\$224,000 multi-year grant from 1994 from the Ford Foundation to 'help
build infrastructure for international promotion of the SALW issue'.139
It is important to note that the conflict -- security -- development
nexus is heavily emphasized by some Southern governments and NGOs, in
particular those in sub-Saharan Africa, and that some Southern NGOs such
as Viva Rio (Brazil) and Gun Free South Africa, have been key Southern
influences on the small arms SMALL ARMS CONTROL AND THE REPRODUCTION OF
IMPERIAL RELATIONS 207 Downloaded by \[Tufts University\] at 19:54 06
October 2014 debate**[. There is thus a significant degree of
co-production of small arms control by actors across the commonly-held
divides of International Relations between public and private, and (less
so) North and South. Aid agencies, non-governmental organizations and
research centres from North and South are involved in the promulgation
of small arms control efforts. But within this internationalizing
formation, research, funding and policy initiatives tend to come from
the North, and the vast majority of interventions take place in the
South. Overall, the institutional basis of small arms control is marked
by a distinctly North --South relation which, although actors do their
best to mitigate its worst effects, remains notably hierarchical Small
arms control theory and practice play a role in the reproduction of
imperial relations through the application of Eurocentric categories,
the asymmetry of control efforts between North and South, the production
of the South as inadequate and needing Northern tutelage, and the mutual
constitution of both North and South in relations of hierarchy. Such a
critique goes beyond the immediate policy question of how to control
armed violence in the South, and is suggestive of the generative and
constitutive role of scholarly-practitioner debate about small arms
control.]{.underline}** It raises the broader question of the
international relations that are produced, reproduced and/or challenged
through the debates and practices of small arms control. International
concern with small arms tells us more about the dominant international
security imaginary than it does about armed violence in the South. As
Krause argues, 'Very little, if anything, objectively changes in the
early 1990s,' suggesting that the creation of expert knowledge and
changed normative space were central to the 'explosion of interest' in
small arms.141 While claims of empirical specificity are made in
relation to particular conflicts and countries, and policy responses are
increasingly understood as evidence-based, small arms control can be
understood as a means of producing the South through particular
knowledge practices.142 This means that, rather than a response to an
externally-given policy need, the small arms debate plays a role in
producing this category of weapons as a problem of international
politics. The solutions proposed in this debate are part of the
reproduction of the international relations of organized violence. This
is not to make an instrumentalist or functionalist argument. As
Heathershaw argues in relation to peacebuilding more widely, few
practitioners or scholar-practitioners 'would see themselves as
representatives of the community policing arms of an imperial power',
and scholarship and policy work often 'depart\[s\] significantly from
the territorial and timeless national (security) discourses'
traditionally studied in international relations.143 **[Rather, it is to
make an argument about the co-productivity of academic and practitioner
practice and the power relations that are reproduced through the use of
seemingly progressive categories and concepts. Eurocentrism generates an
inadequate understanding of violence in the South, and inappropriate and
ineffective solutions that are an attempt to build or shape states and
societies in an idealized European image.]{.underline}**

#### The aff's seemingly neutral reduction of arms sales paradoxically increases military hierarchies and entrenches neoliberal global governance

A notable aspect of **[the post--Cold War arms control agenda has been
the appearance]{.underline}**, and in many respects the relative
success, **[of]{.underline}** what has been labeled as **[a humanitarian
arms control]{.underline}** (HAC) (Greene 2010; Hynek 2007) **[or
humanitarian disarmament]{.underline}** (Borrie 2009, 312; Borrie and
Randin 2006) agenda. This has included, in particular, the campaign on
landmines that led to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, the campaign to ban
cluster munitions that resulted in the 2008 Convention on Cluster
Munitions, and a range of initiatives designed to control the trade in
small arms and light weap- ons, most notably, the 2001 UN Program of
Action on Small Arms. To the extent that current efforts to negotiate an
Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) are animated by humanitarian concerns, this
initiative might also be classi- fied as a further example of HAC in
action. What all these cases of conven- tional arms regulation also have
in common is that they have generally been discussed by commentators as
examples of a control agenda that marks a striking departure from the
traditional practices and foci of arms control and as instances of the
transformative power of global civil soci- ety campaigners working to
operationalize a benevolent human security agenda. This chapter aims to
challenge these assumptions. Instead, it will argue that **[such
initiatives are far more ambiguous in both their roots and their
consequences than mainstream accounts might suggest.]{.underline}**
**[Initiatives]{.underline}** such as those on landmines and cluster
munitions are actu- ally **[part of a much longer history of regulation
and taboos constructed around "pariah weapons."]{.underline}** Following
on from this, I will argue that **[the social construction of certain
weapons as particularly odious has more to do with the interests of
powerful actors]{.underline}** and the relationship of such weapons to
legitimized military technologies **[than any inherently inhu- mane
characteristics]{.underline}** claimed for them. These points will be
illustrated by way of brief discussions on the way the meanings attached
to both cluster munitions and small arms have altered over time. The
chapter will then discuss the ways in which dominant models of economy
and geographies of threat construction have worked to produce particular
approaches to arms trade regulation in different eras. **[A key
contention with regard to the post--Cold War era will be that it has
been characterized by an (appar- ent) arms trade paradox, whereby the
proliferation of formal instruments of international regulation,
ostensibly designed to constrain the conven- tional arms trade, has also
coincided with a shift to a more permissive approach to arms sales in
general]{.underline}**. Viewed at the system level however, the
**[specific combination of permission and proscription]{.underline}**
characteristic of the post--Cold War era **[makes sense as a morphology
of regulation that]{.underline}**, in broad terms, **[aims to
triangulate between efforts to discriminate against pariah actors, to
support the bio-political goals of intrastate pacification in the global
South, and to maintain military hierarchy]{.underline}**. Understood
from this perspective, the humanitarian arms control agenda has had far
more ambiguous effects than its supporters allow. While it has certainly
produced some notable arms control achievements, **[it has also served
to reflect]{.underline}** and reaffirm **[a new "new standard of
civilization]{.underline}**" centered around the distinction between
discriminate and indiscriminate weapons and modes of warfare **[that are
key elements in the legitimizing discourse of both contemporary
militarism and liberal peace intervention]{.underline}**. his chapter
then, represents an attempt to respond to the call from our editors,
Jackie Smith and Ernesto Verdeja, for thinking about peace- building
that is systemic. That is, scholarship that does not simply focus on the
inside of the postconflict state but that, rather, considers how broader
historic and world-system factors shape the global architecture of peace
and violence that specific instances of liberal peacebuilding are both
located in and conditioned by. Accordingly, the chapter will conclude by
briefly considering the implications of this analysis for our
understanding of the role played by arms trade NGOs as actors in the
strategic complexes of the liberal peace and by briefly outlining the
elements of a more eman- cipatory agenda for arms trade regulation.
Humanitarian Arms Control There are a number of common claims that are
made about the various initiatives labeled under the rubric of
humanitarian arms control. First, supporters claim that the bans on
cluster munitions and landmines in particular represent novel moments in
the history of arms control, a nov- elty that stems partly from the fact
that commitments to ban specific cat- egories of conventional weapons
are considered to be unprecedented. As Thakur and Maley have suggested,
for example, the Mine Ban Treaty was "historically significant for being
the first to impose a ban on an entire class of weapons already in
widespread use" (Thakur and Maley 1999; also see Williams 2008, 282).
Second, it is claimed that the bans on antipersonnel mines (APMs) and
cluster munitions as well as international action to address small arms
proliferation represent signal successes of a new post--Cold War human
security agenda (Axworthy 1998, 451; Francheschet 2006, 33--34; Owen
2008). Third, advocates argue that a key element in the success of the
cam- paigns on APMs and cluster munitions in particular has been a
reframing of them as presenting specifically humanitarian problems. It
is this dis- cursive move on the part of campaigners that is deemed to
have enabled them to promote HAC initiatives as issues necessitating
action within the parameters of human security, rather than an arms
control issue subject to the realpolitik logics of national security
(Williams, Goose, Wareham 2008, 2; Cottrell 2009). In particular, the
campaigns on landmines, cluster munitions, and small arms have all been
grounded in a discourse that emphasizes the threat posed to innocent
civilians---which, in the case of the first two in particular, is deemed
a function of the "inherently inhu- mane" (Thakur and Maley 1999, 296)
nature of the technology. A final theme in the narratives on
humanitarian arms control is the emphasis given to the transformative
potential of global civil society (albeit in alliance with key
like-minded states) acting as an expression of bottom-up power, to
persuade the majority of foot-dragging states of the necessity to take
action (Mathew and Rutherford 2003, 29--30; Roberts 2008, 183). In
summary, this is a narrative of the post--Cold War humani- tarian arms
control agenda as a novel, radical, entirely benign, bottom- up endeavor
that places the security of the human at the very heart of practice. The
contribution of HAC initiatives to pre-conflict, in-conflict, and
post-conflict peacebuilding would therefore appear to be both self-
evident and indisputable, not least by reducing the frequency with which
problem weapons are utilized in war and by limiting their deadly legacy
after conflict. There has, of course, been some dispute over the extent
to which HAC initiatives have really produced changes in practice. For
example, the fail- ure of key producer or user states (e.g., the United
States, China, India, Pakistan, Russia) to sign up to the bans on
landmines and cluster muni- tions is widely acknowledged as a weakness.
Similarly, detractors have criticized the tendency in initiatives on
small arms to focus on illicit rather than legal supplies (Mutimer 2006)
and have tended to be less positive about the effect of such initiatives
in actually curbing the small arms trade (Karp 2006). These are
certainly weaknesses that undermine the claims of HAC advocates.
However, in the case of landmines at least, the attempt to construct a
weapons taboo that influences the behavior of actors irrespec- tive of
their formal adherence to the Ottawa Treaty would appear to have been
relatively successful (see table below). Such debates on the scope of
agreements and their implementation as well as studies of the modes of
negotiation and campaigning are cer- tainly important, but they also
reflect a level of analysis problem inherent in much of the literature
on humanitarian arms control; a literature that rarely goes beyond a
narrow, time-bound and policy-orientated discus- sion of campaigning
strategies, policy arguments, and implementation issues. There is,
admittedly, a smaller literature that steps back from this kind of
discussion and undertakes a second level of analysis focused on the
politics of HAC agenda setting, explaining the adoption of particular
initiatives as a function, for example, of the relative abilities of key
NGOs to prescribe or proscribe particular campaigning agendas (Carpenter
2011, 69--102). This kind of approach certainly offers greater
explanatory power compared to the first level of analysis, but it tends
to be both ahis- torical and grounded in an anemic conception of power.
Consequently, it offers only a partial explanation of how specific
control agendas come to be adopted instead of others. My concern, then,
in the remainder of this chapter, is not so much to consider the success
or failure of particular ini- tiatives as understood in the first level
of analysis nor to ponder the rela- tive influence of narrowly defined
sets of norm entrepreneurs. Instead, it is to undertake both a more
historically informed examination of con- ventional arms trade
regulation and one that seeks to explain the relative capacity of
particular actors to set HAC agendas not only in terms of their own
qualities but also as a function of much larger paradigm shifts in, for
example, dominant approaches to economy, security, and war. In order to
do this, however, it is first necessary to illustrate the ahistoricism
at the heart of the literature on HAC by examining the longer history of
both pariah weapons regulation and the way this reflects particular
relation- ships between power, arms ethics, and legitimized weaponry.
This ahistoricism is perhaps most obviously highlighted by the fact that
there is a long record of initiatives aimed at eliminating certain
pariah weapons or restricting their use in particular contexts. Examples
include the attempts to impose bans or limits on the use of poison,
"Greek fire," the crossbow, the gun in seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century Japan, dum dum bullets, and the submarine (Burns
2009). The specific mix of motivations underpinning these attempts has
varied according to each particular case, with some, such as the attempt
to restrict the operation of submarines, arguably more clearly rooted in
state calculations of realpo- litik (Manson 1992). The success of such
initiatives has varied from case to case. For example, restrictions on
the submarine failed to survive the exigencies of total war in World War
II, while restrictions on the gun in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
Japan resulted in its almost total dis- appearance from society, despite
the fact that it had originally been quite widespread (Perrin 1979).
However, notwithstanding their different levels of success, such
restrictions do illustrate that there is nothing particularly novel or
unique to the post--Cold War era attempt to ban specific weapons
technologies. Moreover, the justification of such measures by appeals to
some kind of principled discourse is not unusual. For example, the
prohibition on the use of crossbows issued by the Second Lateran Council
of 1139 (and reissued at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215) was not
only underpinned by the Church and reinforced by religious sanction (the
penalty of anath- ema), but was also represented as a restriction
imposed on "that deadly and God-detested art of slingers and archers"
(Croft 1996, 24). Such views were also reflected in late eleventh- and
early twelfth-century carvings on the pilgrimage churches on the way to
Compostela depicting demons with crossbows (Strickland and Hardy 2011,
61--3). Similarly, prohibitions on the use of poison that appear as far
back as the Hindu Laws of Manu (ca. 2000BC--200AD), have often been
accompanied by some appeal to higher moral standards---whether grounded
in religious ethics or notions of military honor. In particular---like
many pariah weapons---discussions of both proscription and legitimacy
have often evolved around rather fluid concepts of "the standard of
civilization." This was particularly the case in Europe from the
eighteenth century onward when the prohibi- tion against poison became
an accepted part of the laws of war, in part at least because it was
subject to a dual and self-reinforcing construction as a weapon that was
both typical of savages and one that had no place in war between
civilized nations (Price 1997, 26). Not that the standard of
civilization always pointed in the direction of restraint with regard to
pariah weapons. For instance, just as prohibi- tions on the use of the
crossbow were not extended to their use against barbarians, so the
British argued against the ban on dum dum bullets imposed at the 1899
Hague conference on the grounds that the greater destructive potential
of expanding bullets was necessary for use in colo- nial wars because
"the savage, like the tiger . . . will go on fighting even when
desperately wounded" (Spiers 1975, 7). Indeed, the British even
considered adopting a double stock of ammunition---one, consisting of
expanding bullets, for use in colonial wars and another set for use
against a European enemy (ibid.). As Price has noted, then, the
categorization of weapons as humane or inhumane, civilized or
uncivilized, not only natu- ralizes or delegitimizes particular
practices of international violence but also serves to secure (and
indeed construct) the identities of actors in the process (Price 1997,
9). Both moral sentiment and concerns about the standard of civiliza-
tion were also reflected in **[the arms trade provisions of the 1890
Brussels Act]{.underline}**. **[Although principally an antislavery
initiative, the agreement not only included restrictions on firearms
aimed at preventing the slave trade and limiting their "pernicious and
preponderating part" in "internal wars between the native
tribes"]{.underline}** (Burns 1993, 1329), but was also agreed against
the backdrop of a pan-European civil society campaign rooted in ethical
concerns for the colonized. Thus, the British government was bombarded
by letters of support for the act from campaigners concerned at the way
" . . . the indiscriminate trade in firearms and ammunition has been,
and is, a great curse and injury to the native races of Africa" (Let-
ter from Mr. F. W. Fox to Lord Salisbury, October 17, 1889, Fox 1889).
The participants at the Brussels Conference, where the agreement was
negoti- ated, also received numerous communications from groups
supporting the restrictions on the slave, arms, and liquor trades under
discussion. For example, the Aborigines Protection Society sent a
memorial declaring its long-standing commitment to upholding "the right
of uncivilized races to humane and equitable treatment" and arguing that
the supply of firearms and other munitions of war should, as far as
possible, be absolutely forbidden, and that their importa- tion from the
coast to the interior should be strictly limited to the pur- poses
helpful to civilization \[while the relevant local authorities should
be\] rigidly held responsible for any breach of duty in contributing to
internecine war among native tribes (Aborigines Protection Society to
the President of the International Conference in Brussels, December 16,
1889). The eventual outcome was an agreement to restrict the importation
of fire- arms (particularly sophisticated weapons) as well as powder and
ammu- nition into an area extending from the middle of the Sahara to
present-day Namibia and Zimbabwe. However, while particular instances of
arms regulation might be actively supported by campaigners concerned to
promote human welfare, and be framed in the most principled language (of
its era), this tells us little about the broader system of arms trade
regulation in which they are embedded. **[For example, the passage of
the Brussels Act]{.underline}** occurred in a period that "saw the
fewest restraints and regulations on the arms trade in modern history"
(Krause and MacDonald 1992, 712), thus **[illustrat- ing the way in
which instances of apparently ethical restraint can exist within a
highly permissive architecture of regulation]{.underline}**. This raises
two questions: what creates the facilitating conditions for ethical
appeals for arms restraint to gain traction even in such circumstances,
and how can we understand their relationship to the global system of
arms regulation? Four factors are crucial: the relationship between arms
regulation and the narrow political and material interests of powerful
actors; the rela- tionship between pariah weapons and legitimized
military technology; the relationship between economic philosophy and
the approach to arms regulation; and the relationship between the global
system of arms trade regulation and the dominant framing of threats in
particular eras. Only by examining the interplay of these factors can we
properly reflect on the role played by global civil society campaigns on
the arms trade and con- sider their effects on broader efforts to
promote peace---both globally and in the aftermath of local conflicts.
Power and Interest Discussions of humanitarian arms control tend to
represent campaigning NGOs as agents of the powerless acting (albeit in
alliance with some like- minded states) to mobilize global public
opinion and pressure the larger body of reluctant states to adopt
principled measures designed to fur- ther human welfare. Alternatively,
some analysts have also highlighted the way middle-ranking states such
as Canada have used campaigns on landmines or small arms as vehicles to
enhance their diplomatic status in international forums such as the UN
(Cottrell 2009). Both of these frame- works certainly capture important
ways in which power and interest have interacted in the HAC agenda.
However, even a brief analysis of the longer history of pariah weapons
restrictions illustrates the need for more con- sideration of the way
current initiatives might mirror older initiatives in reinforcing the
interests of powerful actors. For example, one factor in the virtual
eradication of the gun in sev- enteenth- and eighteenth-century Japan
was that it represented a threat to the warrior class when in the hands
of the lower classes (Perrin 1979, 25--33). Similarly, although the
**[weapons restrictions in the 1890 Brussels Act]{.underline}** were
certainly grounded in an ethical discourse, they **[were primarily
rooted in concerns about the impact of the arms trade on colonial
order]{.underline}**. For instance, one British official calculated at
the time that eighty thou- sand to one hundred thousand firearms
annually were entering Africa via East African ports (Beachey 1962,
453), while immediately before the Brussels Conference convened, six
hundred thousand rifles destined for Africa were sold in Antwerp (Krause
and MacDonald 1992). Conse- quently, as one British official observed:
The chief value of the work of the Brussels conference lies . . . in the
uniform rules to be applied to the introduction of arms and spirits. . .
. Without such rules and provisions I regard the government of Africa by
Europeans \[as\] impossible. The African Continent . . . is far from
rich, it is tropical and feverish, and will prove not worth holding in
the face of a population of savages supplied with firearms and degraded
with trade spirits (Memorandum by Sir John Kirk, August 15, 1891). Thus,
as Engelbrecht and Hanighen would later observe, **[the arms ele- ments
of the Brussels Act were "a selfish measure of the great imperialist
powers to keep modern weapons out of their colonies and to hold them in
submission"]{.underline}** (Engelbrecht and Hanighen 1934, 267). This
same concern also prompted various efforts to ensure guns were stamped,
registered, and licensed, as well as to restrict gun ownership to
officials or "reliable persons." The signatory powers also agreed to
exchange information with each other (Beachey 1962, 457). Other
initiatives stemming from the same urge to control the proliferation of
firearms included the imposition of a gun tax under the Uganda Agreement
of 1900, resulting in the surrender of many obsolete weapons not
considered worthy of such a tax (ibid., 461). The history of pariah
weapons regulation would therefore appear to demonstrate a persistent
link between the material and political interests of states and/or
powerful elites and the emergence of pariah weapons regulation. Of
course, the material and political interests of the same, or other,
powerful actors also provide countervailing pressures. For exam- ple,
the immediate interests of nobles in winning wars with crossbows mostly
won out over their broader class interests (McNeill 1982, 67--80). But
the point is that attempts at pariah regulation cannot be explained
purely by reference to popular pressure or humanitarian concerns. Yet
despite this there has been little reflection on the part of
commentators regarding the ways in which contemporary restrictions might
reflect the interests of powerful states and other actors, albeit in
ways that are sub- ject to similar countervailing pressures---an issue
that will be explored in more detail below. Constructing the "Other" of
the Legitimized and Heroic Weapon The relationship between power,
interest, and regulation can sometimes be direct, as in the case of bans
on swords or crossbows that pose a threat to elites. This relationship
can also manifest itself in both more indirect and complex ways---one
example being the manner in which the narra- tives deployed by hegemonic
actors to legitimize dominant weapons and ways of war can have the
effect of delegitimizing particular categories of weapons that fail to
accord with such narratives. In some cases this may occur as an
unintended consequence of the dominant framing. In other cases the
process of delegitimization may be actively promoted, for example as
part of a process by which other weapons are constructed as
"heroic"---weapons deemed to embody positive values such as honor and/or
values that are deemed central to national defense. For example, the
series of relatively successful acts implemented in England between 1508
and 1542 banning crossbows and handguns (albeit initially with an
exemption for men worth more than £100 per annum) were largely rooted in
a concern to preserve the use of the heroic long- bow, deemed central to
a long line of English military successes (Payne- Gallwey 2007, 34). The
Japanese ban on the gun was similarly connected to the romanticization
of the heroic samurai sword as the visible form of one's honor and as
associated with grace of movement in battle (Perrin 1979). In effect
both weapons became the "other" that defined legitimized military
technologies and militarism. Similar themes also help explain the
contemporary taboos constructed around particular sets of military
technology such as cluster munitions. Cluster Munitions What is notable
about the campaign against cluster munitions is not that it succeeded in
banning an inhumane weapon but that this success occurred when cluster
munitions use was actually in decline compared to the peak years of the
Vietnam era (Borrie 2009, 433--36). The latter was a period when some
790,000 cluster bombs containing 383 million submunitions were dropped
on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, a total greater than their combined
populations (Prokosch 1995, 97). The United States also contem- plated
using them even more extensively. For example, the August 1966 JASON
Report proposed an antipersonnel and antivehicle barrier along the
demilitarized zone, which required the monthly use of approximately
20,000 CBU-24 cluster bombs. Given that each CBU-24 included between 640
and 670 submunitions (Borrie 2009, 11), this implied the distribution of
at least 12.8 million submunitions per month. Although this proposal was
never implemented, it reflected the fact that, in the opinion of the US
military, "CBUs were categorized as a standard weapon, to be taken off
the shelf---'conventional ironmongery'" (Krepon 1974, 600). This is not
to suggest that the United States use of cluster munitions in this
period went unremarked. For example, there were efforts in the 1970s by
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to promote
restrictions on their use (Borrie 2009, 11--16). The point is, however,
that these efforts never achieved traction either in diplomatic forums
or with a wider public in the way that the issue would thirty years
later. The same point can also be made with respect to landmines, which,
as early as the mid-1950s, were discussed in the secret committee
established to imple- ment the Tripartite Agreement between France, the
United States, and Britain to restrict arms sales to the Middle East.
However, in response to a French query as to whether APM exports should
be restricted on "human- itarian grounds," the United States responded
(and Britain concurred) that landmines were not "any more or less
objectionable on humanitarian grounds than any other weapons" (Near East
Arms Coordinating Com- mittee, Minutes, November 14, 1954). Reframing
cluster munitions and landmines as immoral and inhu- mane was only made
feasible with the advent of three interrelated fac- tors: the
mainstreaming of human security, the framing of intervention as
humanitarian, and the construction of modern weapons as humane because
of their greater capacity for precision. The mainstreaming of human
security in the policy discourse of governments (however tokenistic in
practice) created a facilitating environment in which the reconstruction
of cluster munitions and landmines as threats to the human (understood
as innocent civilians) could be undertaken. This was further enhanced by
the representation of intervention as humanitarian and of precision
weapons as instruments of a humane Western way of warfare undertaken to
save strangers from "thugs who know little and care less about civilized
behaviour" (Guthrie, cited in Coker 2001, 3). The combined effect was to
create a legitimized discursive space into which campaigners could
insert a re-representation of landmines and cluster munitions technology
as inhumane. The introduction of bans on cluster munitions and APMs is
there- fore a far more ambiguous achievement than is generally suggested
in the mainstream literature. On the one hand, the legitimizing
discourse of Western militaries and arms firms was turned against them
in order to generate powerful taboos against particular categories of
weapons--- even in the face of opposition from these militaries. On the
other hand, as I have argued elsewhere, "the same **[prohibitions can be
understood as performative acts that simultaneously function to codify
aspects of a new set of criteria for judging international
respectability in a post--Cold War era, to reinforce the security
framings of the era and to legitimize those categories of weapons
successfully constructed as precise, discriminate and thus
humane]{.underline}**" (Cooper 2011, 145).

### Arm Sales Reform Link

#### Reform is an empty promise -- ethical discourse campaigns about arms sales reductions have led to rises in military profits and increased global arms transfers

Conclusion: The Implications for Global Civil Society Action **[The
current architecture of conventional arms trade regulation can be
summarized as aimed at the restriction of pariah
technologies]{.underline}**, the disci- plining of pariah actors, the
**[pacification of populations, and the mainte- nance of military
hierarchy within an overall framework that is]{.underline}** actually
**[quite permissive]{.underline}**. One consequence of this is that **[a
loud ethical discourse around the restriction of]{.underline}**
landmines, cluster munitions, and small **[arms has gone hand-in-hand
with recent rises in both global military expenditure and arms
transfers]{.underline}**. For example, between 2001 and 2009, US
spending on defense rose 60 percent in real terms and now accounts for
43 percent of military global spending (SIPRI 2010, Table 5.2, 198).
**[Over- all, world defense expenditures are now estimated at \$1,531
billion]{.underline}** (\$224 per person), **[an increase of 45 percent
in real terms from 2000 to 2009]{.underline}** (ibid., 177). Similarly,
**[global arms exports of major conventional weapons were 22 percent
higher]{.underline}** in real terms for the period 2005--2009 than for
he preceding 2000--2004 period, with the United States, Russia, Germany,
France, and Britain accounting for over two-thirds of exports (ibid.,
285). This raises some hard questions for campaigners. On the one hand,
humanitarian arms control efforts have produced positive benefits for
the security of the human, most notably via the relatively successful
weap- ons taboo constructed around landmines. On the other hand, the
**[fram- ing of landmines and cluster munitions as problem weapons has
been rooted in the same discourse that legitimizes military intervention
in the post--Cold War era.]{.underline}** Moreover, arms trade
**[NGOs]{.underline}** have largely **[neglected rises in defense
expenditure in major weapons states]{.underline}** such as the United
States or intra-Northern trade in arms in favor of an agenda **[that
conceives the South---and in particular pariah actors in sub-Saharan
Africa---as the primary object of conventional arms trade
regulation]{.underline}** (Stavrianakis 2010). Indeed, international
initiatives such as the EU Code or the Was- senaar Arrangement, national
export regulations of the major weapons states, and the local
initiatives of client states mostly combine to produce a cartography of
prohibition that corresponds more closely with the dis- ciplinary
geographies advocated by the powerful rather than any global map of
militarism and injustice. As one recent econometric analysis of major
weapons transfers from the United States, Britain, France, and Ger- many
concluded, despite much rhetoric about the need for a more ethical
approach to arms sales from governments in all these countries: Neither
human rights abuses nor autocratic polity would appear to reduce the
likelihood of countries receiving Western arms, or reduce the relative
share of a particular exporter's weapons they receive. **[In fact, human
rights abusing countries are actually more likely to receive weapons
from the United States]{.underline}**, whilst autocratic regimes emerge
as more likely recipients of weaponry from France and the UK (Perkins
and Neumayer 2010, 254). Of course, arms trade NGOs have often been the
first to highlight such hypocrisies, and the work of most organizations
include, to various degrees, elements of critique or advocacy that might
be considered trans- formational. However, one of the principal features
of recent arms trade activism is the extent to which NGOs have
downgraded the radical critique of militarism in exchange for insider
influence and government funding (Stavrianakis 2010). In part, this may
be because of the political economy of both NGO funding from governments
and charities that, to some extent at least, encourages work on topics
that are either safer or more popular. For example, the big US
foundations have moved away from a concern with national export controls
(Stavrianakis 2010, 74). It may also reflect the political economy of
that other currency crucial for NGOs: access to, and influence on,
governments. As Carpenter (drawing on interviews with a range of arms
trade NGOs) has noted, "mainstream human security orga- nizations avoid
issues that would be perceived to link them to the antiwar movement, as
part of their credibility with states comes from a discourse that sees
war as legitimate, within certain constraints" (Carpenter 2011, 97).
Lastly, it may also be because **[many NGOs tend to focus on specific
dimensions of the arms trade (such as human rights, development, small
arms, landmines) rather than the overall morphology of regulation and
its relationship to broader hierarchies of power]{.underline}**.
Progress in one area of campaigning can thus more easily be perceived as
a success for a bottom-up articulation of a human security agenda linked
to specific arms trade issues. **[In contrast, it is more accurate to
char- acterize the current humanitarian arms control agenda as, at best,
a form of arms control from below articulated within the logic of
militarism from above, a series of tactical reforms]{.underline}**
within an overarching economic and security paradigm **[that justifies
intervention, regulation, and transformation of the South]{.underline}**
while (with the exception of token action on landmines) **[leaving the
vast accumulation of Western armaments largely
unproblematized]{.underline}**.

### China-Ukraine Relations Link

#### Chinese influence in Ukraine is a form of economic militarization that profits on unending violence in the Global South

As in Egypt, **[China's rise]{.underline}** in Brazil **[is also part of
the story of economic militarization. Brazil's military engineers have
established large-scale partnerships with military industries across
Africa, and in 2015 ratified cooperation with the Chinese People's
Liberation Army for technology transfer]{.underline}**s. Joint
Brazil-China military maneuvers began in 2011, a year that Chinese
enterprises invested \$11 billion in Brazil. And under the crunch of the
draconian austerity government imposed by the grossly unpopular
post-impeachment government under Michel Temer, the military has faced
large budget cuts, giving strong incentive to the Armed Forces to
balance its books by **[expanding its presence in the global free market
of interstate arms sales, particularly to China.]{.underline}** In this
way, arms sales to major economies hav become a central part of the
Brazilian government's "economic recovery agenda." In the wake of these
dramatic changes, how can we map the changing 21st-century military
political economies in terms of both transregional trends and
divergences? Transregional Trends As these cases demonstrate,
**[militarized state institutions and security agencies around the world
are assuming new or newly-expanded roles as investors]{.underline}**,
contractors, **[and]{.underline}** even **[corporate profiteers. They
are advancing in areas formerly associated with private-sector business
and non-military dimensions of the public sector. To]{.underline}** be
sure, the phenomenon of military interests driving structural changes in
capitalism is not new. In the twentieth century, during periods of rapid
industrialization and decolonization, **[military institutions played
key functions as spurs of economic development and as partners of the
business sector across the globe.]{.underline}** And in other epochs, of
course, they acted to enforce processes of colonial dispossession and
extraction. **[For example, in the Global North, extensive scholarly and
activist literatures have illuminated the role of the U.S.
military-industrial complex in the development of manufacturing,
high-tech, and infrastructure sectors. In the Global South, researchers
have revealed the ways that entrepreneurial corporations in Africa today
employ mercenary firms that operate not just as paramilitaries but as a
parastates---shadow, for-profit regimes that prey upon countries,
peoples, and resources with impunity]{.underline}**. And other
investigators have detailed the political and economic impact of
military entrepreneurialism in Pakistan, Thailand, and Indonesia. But
Latin America and the Middle East have retained particular academic and
activist attention since the mid-20th century. In these two regions,
researchers have focused on the persistent militarization of the state
and the relationship between structural militarization and authoritarian
populism in Latin America and intersecting formations of secularism, the
Left, and postcolonial nationalism in the Middle East. Shana Marshall,
Zeinab Abul-Magd, Hazem Kandil, and Yazid Sayigh have published
pioneering and nuanced analyses of the changing 21st-century economic
roles of the Egyptian Armed Forces, which inform this research. And
Fernando Brancoli, Maria Celina d'Araujo, Amanda Pinheiro de Oliveira,
Thiago Moreira Rodrigues, Martha Huggins, and Jorge Zaverucha have
outlined illuminating perspectives on changing Brazilian military
identities and practices in the global context. My research builds upon
this work by exploring how military political economies of various forms
are advancing in prominence especially around investment in megaprojects
and megaevents. Today, much of the traditional "private sector" has
become a military or paramilitary sector dominated by security logics.
Unlike classic populist projects, these mega-scale security logics are
not primarily oriented toward public safety or national patrimony but to
infrastructures and projects that favor the interests of the titans of
the private sector and investor classes. I refer to such projects as
"parapopulist" political economies, rather than as populist regimes in
the 20th century sense, which were oriented toward the development of
state and public industries. Though these new parapopulist projects
purport to be for "the people" and "the nation," they are not truly
populist, because even if they do trigger a brief boom in construction
jobs, they do not offer a future for the vast majority of "the people,"
as clients, laborers, or masses, as substantive beneficiaries of these
developments. In fact, this new generation of mega constructions emerges
from the sand and stretches into the sky unencumbered by production
sector targets or population-serving aims. It would seem that these
forms of military capitalism do not function as neoliberal market
formations in their classic conception. It is true that elected
conservatives like Mauricio Macri in Argentina and finance ministers
across the Middle East and Latin America have unlearned the lessons of
the catastrophic 2008 global financial crisis and trumpet, once again, a
fundamentalism of market logics and investment finance. Nevertheless,
the privileging of military and security actors by many of these same
states, and their shift toward modes of governance centered around crime
panics and corruption purges indicate something other than neoliberal
restoration is occurring. Austerity and financial logics in these
regions no longer offer a hegemonic vision of a consumer utopia, free
choices, or individual rights---the hallmarks of neoliberal ideology.
Instead these regimes have embraced longterm, explicitly coercive
illiberal security politics that have everything to do with realignments
of force, investment, and dispossession. What else is new about this set
of transregional patterns of militarized capitalism? First, **[military
forces now coordinate domestic building efforts, public security, and
social displacement in addition to---or instead of---focusing primarily
on preparing for external wars and defense. Second, military-capitalist
relations now define state-linked investment initiatives in the Global
South. They capitalize on rivalries between Chinese companies and
Persian Gulf sovereign-fund investors, while U.S., Russian, British,
German, and Italian arms contractors remain key courtiers of military
economies in both regions.]{.underline}** Third, new questions of civil
accountability and labor resistance haunt this new militarized economy.
As the heads of the economy and governance agencies, should soldiers be
a part of an expansion of public-sector workers' rights, or do they
function as the antithesis of those rights? Should the profits created
by military-coordinated projects be redistributed as public patrimony or
recaptured as private wealth by oligarchs?

### Crisis Framing Link

#### The crisis framing of terrorism under neoliberalism creates endless militarization and justifies pre-emptive violence within counterterrorism operations

Politics from Aberystwyth University and has published articles in the

**[This embrace of neoliberalism has led to the development of societies
where political influence has been captured by corporate
actors]{.underline}**. According to Susan George (1999), it has **[led
to growing inequality]{.underline}**, **[with]{.underline}**
neoliberalism having precipitated **[a massive transfer of wealth, power
and resources from the poorest in society to the
richest]{.underline}**.2 As Hall, Massey, and Rustin (2013, 4) explain,
"it has **[encouraged private capital to hollow-out the welfare
state]{.underline}** and dismantle\... **[structures of health, welfare
and education]{.underline}** services" **[in]{.underline}** the
**[pursuit of profit]{.underline}**. In essence, neoliberalism generates
winners and losers, with the richest in society gaining to the detriment
of the poorest. This is important if we consider the neoliberal
definition of "loser", to whom nothing is owed. As George (1999, para
30) notes, "anyone can be ejected from the system at any time -- because
of illness, age, pregnancy, perceived failure, or simply because
economic circumstances and the relent- less transfer of wealth from top
to bottom demand it". Indeed, neoliberalism has funda- mentally altered
politics in the sense that: Politics used to be primarily about who
ruled whom and who got what share of the pie. Aspects of both these
central questions remain, of course, but the great new central question
of politics is\... "Who has a right to live and who does not?" Radical
exclusion is now the order of the day. (George 1999, para 32) George's
observation resonates here in the sense that she points to a gap in the
literature that this issue aims to address: the extent to which the
economic theory of neoliberalism can be understood as a form of terror.
**[First, with regard to the idea of the economic theory of
"neoliberalism as terror" there is a small body of research that has
been conducted under the guise of cultural studies]{.underline}** by the
critical theorist Henry Giroux (2004, 2005). Focusing specifically on
the United States (US), **[Giroux draws our attention to the ways in
which neoliberalism has transformed how the state provides internal and
external]{.underline}** security for its citizens. For Giroux,
**[neoliberalism]{.underline}** not only **[creates economic terror for
citizens]{.underline}** deemed losers in the neoliberal society
(**[through the hollowing out of the welfare state]{.underline}** and
the removal of economic support), **[but is responsible for a growing
form of political terror, or authoritarianism, that is characterised by
the militarisation of public space at home]{.underline}** and the
suppression of dissent. He argues that: **[Neoliberalism has become
complicitous with this transformation of the democratic state into a
national security state]{.underline}** that repeatedly uses its military
and political power to develop a daunting police state\... to punish
workers, stifle dissent, and undermine the political power of labour'
unions and progressive social movements. (Giroux 2005, 8) Indeed, recent
and seemingly disparate events, such as **[the shooting of Michael Brown
in Ferguson]{.underline}**, Missouri, in the United States
**[or]{.underline}** the **[policing of student protest
at]{.underline}** the University of **[Warwick]{.underline}** in the
United Kingdom, **[reflect forms of neoliberal terror in the sense that
they are made possible by a political culture]{.underline}**, which is
**[based on]{.underline}** fear, **[surveillance and
control]{.underline}** rather than one based on "a vibrant culture of
shared responsibility and critical questioning" (Giroux 2005, 4). In the
first half of the special issue, we include contributions from
established and early career scholars, which break new ground in
relation to the ontological relationship between neoliberalism and
terror, albeit in different ways. These articles go beyond existing
security studies literature on security privatization and the importance
of risk governance. They probe the very archetype of the terrorist and
its relation to more surprising bête noirs such as Satan and the figure
of the zombie which, it is argued, has always haunted the development of
capitalism (Neocleous 2015, this issue). In a related vein,
**[Jackson]{.underline}** (2015, this issue) ch**[arts the
epistemological crisis of counterterrorism which drives the War on
Terror security project but simultaneously renders it unending,
redundant and hysterical,]{.underline}** while other contributors turn
to the role of crisis, and especially the contemporary counterterrorist
response, in enabling the perpetual reconfiguration of accumulation and
capitalism (neatly summarised as the "Class War on Terror") (Boukalas
2015, this issue). Looking beyond the global North, Furtado turns to the
terror discourse of South America in which terrorism is predominantly
associated with state rather than non-state actors: an association that
cannot be understood but for the brutal expansion of neoliberal
economics under authoritarian rule (Furtado 2015, this issue). In these
articles, we see how **[the economic machine of capitalism invents and
necessitates the figure of the "Universal Adversary"]{.underline}** (be
that the pig, Satan, the zombie or the terrorist) **[so that it can
refigure itself around crises, concealing its
ambiguities]{.underline}**. Furthermore, from alternate directions, we
see how **[this perpetual project is driven by a paranoid logic that has
led to an epistemological crisis]{.underline}** -- at least in the
global North. In the second half of the issue, we turn to the effects of
neoliberal ideology and economics upon counterterrorism, and vice versa.
The questions asked within this section probe the ways in which the
contemporary economic and ideological era has impacted the practice of
security, including how the deployment of futurity and fantasy within
security discourse has radically redefined fear, such that
**[counterterrorism perpetually tells us that each attack precedes
something worse]{.underline}**. In this imaginary, **[we are no longer
scared of something]{.underline}** definable **[like an explosion
but]{.underline}** the kaleidoscopic anticipatory fixation on even worse
to come. **[We have become frightened of fear itself, and
counterterrorism practice plays a central role in creating the fear
which terrorism supposedly induces]{.underline}** (Frank 2015, this
issue). Addressing the paradoxical effects of neoliberalism upon
counterterrorism from a different direction, Marijn Hoijtink considers
**[the]{.underline}** professional **[security culture]{.underline}**
which has emerged **[around counterterrorism]{.underline}** -- one which
centralises infrastructural systems rather than people -- as objects of
protection (Hoijtink 2015, this issue). People seem to have been
displaced as that which must be protected by counterterrorism, in favour
of system- ised notions of mobility which Hoijtink shows are crucial to
neoliberalism, but they are not entirely absent. For example, Mohammed
Elshimi's article explores the ways in which **[the neoliberal state
remains fascinated with intervention into people's lives]{.underline}**,
especially those identified as risky, dangerous and radicalised.
Building upon work into the govern- mentality of radicalisation
policies, Elshimi explores how deradicalisation programs function
through both anticipatory (neoliberal) logics of detection, but also
pastoral logics of care. The utilisation of confessional technologies
therein, in particular, speaks to the re- emergence of pastoral
techniques whereby the state deploys deradicalisation as a technol- ogy
of the self, and of salvation (Elshimi 2015, this issue). Finally,
reversing the direction of analysis, and assessing the impact of
counterterror- ism upon neoliberalism, it is important to assess the
ways in which **[entertainment and other industries take the neoliberal
security era as an object for commodification]{.underline}** and popular
consumption. As such, Robert Young (2015, this issue) **[explores
representations of war within the video game Splinter Cell,
demonstrating that "older"]{.underline}** (pre-War on Terror)
**[understandings of Just War have become]{.underline}** increasingly
**[blurred]{.underline}** -- rather than abandoned -- **[in a liminal
space composed of "new" warfare of special-ops teams and enhanced
interrogation]{.underline}** -- all for a market of consumers. Following
this section on neoliberal effects upon counterterrorism, this special
issue turns finally to the lived experiences of neoliberal subjects and
what this might tell us about counterterrorism and its regulation. James
Fitzgerald offers an autoethnographic narrative account of his bizarre
experiences with border control professionals at Heathrow airport
(Fitzgerald 2015, this issue). The experience he takes from this
encounter is that, while there are many bad lists, on which we would not
want to appear, there may also be "good lists" -- whose occupants are
deemed sufficiently responsible to carry books on terrorism and resist
the powers of "radicalisation". This is followed by Asim Qureshi,
research director at CAGE, who provides a practitioner account of the
British legal system and its often grossly unfair dealings with terror
suspects (Qureshi 2015, this issue). Throughout these articles, a sense
of vertigo progressively builds with respect to the disastrous
relationship between neoliberalism and counterterrorism. We agree with
Hall, Massey and Rustin's assertion that the theory of **[neoliberalism
"plays a crucial role in legitimising the restoration and reinvigoration
of a regime of power]{.underline}**, profit and privilege" (Hall,
Massey, and Rustin 2013, 9). The purpose of this issue is to expose the
ways in which the neoliberal regime of power functions and offer
suggestions for how we might resist and challenge its negative impact on
societies across the world. The prominent paradoxes, epistemological
crises and cruel, unjustified or simply curious exclusions of
neoliberalism and/as terror are exposed from multiple directions by the
contributors, providing a platform for the radical extension of critical
exploration. Since its inception, the Critical Studies on Terrorism
project has provided a space for critical and dissenting engagements
with the politics of (counter)terrorism. This has included, inter alia,
pro- blematising the production of "expert" knowledge in Terrorism
Studies; deconstructing and challenging dominant counterterrorism
practices; exploring experiences of counter- terrorism at different
levels of the socio-political; and facilitating connections with cognate
research fields, including Peace Research and Gender Studies. Building
on these interventions, this special issue seeks to engage with the
political, social and economic implications of current
conceptualisations and practices of terrorism and the concurrent theme
of neoliberalism as terror. Keynote addresses on neoliberalism as
terror: epistemological crises and capitalist histories of
counterterrorism The keynote addresses presented in this special issue
by Mark Neocleous and Richard Jackson are concerned with the role of
contemporary security discourses in strengthening the Western neoliberal
order, with a particular focus on the way in which these discourses
constitute an enemy (the "Universal Adversary", the "terrorist") that
necessitates some type of counter-response. Both articles are connected
by a belief that contemporary security strategies, and counterterrorism
policies in particular, derive their legitimacy from or are based upon
forms of knowledge that are structured around uncertainty, ambiguity,
imagination and fantasy. Neocleous and Jackson both acknowledge the
unex- pectedly prescient thoughts of Donald Rumsfeld, when he spoke of
known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns, in highlighting what
has become the central concern of the state in terms of its security
logic: anxiety, fear and foreboding over the possible threats of the
future. In this sense, they speak to the arguments of Louise Amoore and
Marieke de Goede (2008, 24), who contend that the War on Terror has
given way to "new rationalities of government that require that the
catastrophic prospects of the future be tamed and managed". The articles
by Neocleous and Jackson both highlight the importance of the discursive
construction of "the enemy", be it the "terrorist" or the "Universal
Adversary", as a central element of this. Mark Neocleous' article
centres upon a category of enemy, **[the "Universal Adversary", which he
argues emerged from the War on Terror as the new preoccupation of the
national security state.]{.underline}**3 He takes as his focus **[the
new paradigm of "national preparedness" and state- based emergency
planning for all manner of security contingencies]{.underline}**, from
natural disasters to terrorist attacks, **[which consist of imagined
disaster scenarios that inevitably involve the fictitious enemy the
"Universal Adversary".]{.underline}** However, this new paradigm of
"national preparedness" not only requires that the state imagine the
disasters of the future (and develop responses to them), it also obliges
citizens to be wary of and prepared for surviving potential attacks or
catastrophes. This line of argument about the logic that underpins
Western security practice is reflected in recent events such as the
introduction, in November 2014, in the United Kingdom (UK) of
"Counter-Terrorism Awareness Week" (UK Government 2014). Not only is
terrorism a "real" threat in this context, but citizens must always
remain vigilant, resilient and continually aware of that threat.
Although emergency planning includes contingencies for natural
disasters, Neocleous contends that in most scenarios the "Universal
Adversary" is represented by the figure of the terrorist. For Neocleous,
this means that there is only one certainty in the minds of politicians,
policy- makers and security practitioners: the "Universal Adversary"
will attack. Neocleous argues that we should take seriously the figure
of the "Universal Adversary" for three main reasons. First, he argues
that the category of the "Universal Adversary" can act as a vehicle
through which to explore class conflict in neoliberal societies. For
example, he draws our attention to the use of certain terms and phrases
in emergency planning documents, such as the phrase "disgruntled
workers". He highlights the etymology and use of such phrases in the
context of the War on Terror to offer a convincing argument for
understanding their use as representative of the bourgeois fear of the
"enemy within", hence re-reading the practices of the War on Terror as a
continuation of class conflict. Second, he argues that **[the War on
Terror and the logic of emergency powers]{.underline}**, which are
legitimised through the discursive construction of threats such as the
"Universal Adversary", **[should involve a discussion of capital and
class, by which he means connecting the War on Terror with class
conflict]{.underline}**, rather than a discussion of emergency powers as
a "state of exception" (contra Agamben). Third, he also offers a
speculative commentary on the notion of **[the "Universal Adversary" as
a contemporary representation]{.underline}** of an old idea **[in
elite]{.underline}** or bourgeois **[thinking, notably the universality
of "the enemy".]{.underline}** Where the focus of Neocleous' article
revolves around the construction of threat with specific reference to
the figure of the "Universal Adversary", Jackson's article concerns
itself with illuminating the epistemological crisis at the heart of
contemporary Western counterterrorism. For Jackson, there are two key
facets to this crisis that are mutually constitutive. First, there is
the discursive construction of the figure of "the terrorist" as a
particular type of enemy. This can be identified in the language used by
politicians, policy-makers, security practitioners and academics to talk
about and define the threat of terrorism. Jackson argues that this
contemporary Western understanding of terrorism is characterised by a
paranoid logic that over-exaggerates the threat posed by terrorism.
Second, there is **[the counter-response to the threat, understood by
Jackson as a way of acting towards the preconceived notion of the
terrorist threat and conditioned by the same paranoid logic which has
made possible a whole range of security practices that include
pre-emptive war, extra-judicial killings, mass surveillance and
torture]{.underline}**. For Jackson, the "epistemological crisis of
counter-terrorism" is captured neatly by the fact that although no
evidence exists to demonstrate that these practices are effective (e.g.,
they make the states that implement them safer from terrorism), these
security practices are now seen as logical responses to the threat from
terrorism. In fact, Jackson argues that all available evidence suggests
that practices of pre- emptive war, extra-judicial killings, mass
surveillance and torture are more likely to reduce the safety of any
state that implements such policies. To get at this apparent paradox,
Jackson draws our attention to four key aspects of the epistemological
crisis of counterterrorism that structure his analysis. First, he notes
the tendency of those working in the field of security to reject
previous knowledge about terrorism. This rejection of knowledge taps
into and is based on the rather suspect assertion that contemporary
forms of terrorism are somehow "new" and different from the "old"
terrorism of the past (Laqueur 1999; Duyvesteyn 2004; Crenshaw 2011).
Second, there is an acceptance of an extreme precautionary dogma whereby
unknown (or constructed) threats are acted upon pre-emptively before
they actualise. This flows into the third point, which is that the
threats identified (or constructed) as threats are largely based upon
imagination and fantasy. Fourth, **[the epistemological crisis is
characterised by a "permanent ontological condition of 'waiting for
terror'\... in relation to the next attack"]{.underline}** (see Jackson
2015, this issue). Jackson draws his analysis to a close by offering a
number of ways in which critical scholars can and should attempt to
resist the paranoid logic of contemporary Western counterterrorism
policy. Neoliberalism as terror? Following the keynote addresses, two
articles within this special issue make bold con- tributions to the
discussion of neoliberalism as terror -- identifying, in different
contexts, the important connections and overlaps between the two. Given
that our conference focused upon the practice of counterterrorism, we
undertake this task within the security sphere, rather than other areas
of social policy. The section begins with articles by Christos Boukalas
and Henrique Furtado. Boukalas provides a thought-provoking and
innovative discussion of the economic functionality of homeland security
reforms in the United States, reflecting upon the War on Terror as class
war. He proclaims that we can understand counterterrorism through the
Marxist conception of class, gaining new insights into its practice and
mandate. Subsequently, in the context of South America, the terrain for
an earlier era of American counterterrorism, Henrique Furtado approaches
overlap between the neoliberal/ising state and terrorism from a very
different direction. His article explores the fascinating discursive
climate whereby the assumptions of the Global North's terror discourse
and, it must be said, much work within Critical Terrorism Studies are
reversed and "terrorism" popularly signifies state repression, with
counterterrorism sig- nifying non-state revolutionary action. How should
we consider these contributions? First, Boukalas invites us to stray
from the beaten path of terrorism studies -- critical and traditional.
What would happen to counterterrorism analysis if we did not start with
the state and instead began with the Marxist conceptualisation of
social/economic dynamics, whereby the state is a particular historical
formation of relations between classes? If the state is a machine which
protects accumulation on behalf of dominant classes, then we can begin
to address counterterror- ism as a technique for the protection of
accumulation. Using the work of social theorist Poulantzas (1979) on the
nature of economic and political crisis, Boukalas argues that economic
crisis is relatively normalised for the state. Antagonisms and sudden
market fluctuations are the natural state of capitalism. However,
political crisis is treated as an extremely serious consideration in
that it embodies the potential to end capitalist rule. Counterterrorism
becomes functional here as the way in which the capitalist state rear-
ranges structures to manage economic crises, while preventing and
suppressing the emergence of political crisis. If Boukalas' contention
was only meant as a comparison or metaphorical critique making use of a
reading of counterterrorism through the lens of class, it would already
make a significant contribution to the literature on Critical Terrorism
Studies. However, Boukalas is not experimenting with a new way of
reading counterterrorism: he is deadly serious that counterterrorism has
been connected to economic restructuring and the simultaneous repression
of political crisis since its inception. His bold critique of
neoliberalism and counterterrorism goes even further, opening potential
future directions in research. The article progresses through a detailed
reading of the Homeland Security architecture in the United States,
situating the economic and repressive functions of this enormous
security project within the context of class war. He argues that, given
financial turbulence of the 1990s and the accompanying growth of the
anti-globalisation movement (and, it might be added, the sudden absence
of a Cold War frame with which to sublimate all antagonisms),
neoliberalism was facing mounting systemic challenges. What, to
paraphrase Lenin, is to be done? Boukalas argues that 9/11 proved
extremely useful as the crisis point around which the protection of
accumulation for the capitalist elite could be undertaken, while
directing the attention of the public at an external enemy. The
capitalism promoted by George Bush and his establishment skilfully
embraced 9/11, moving the US economy towards a new model of accumulation
specifically involving the generation and resolution of crisis through
the reification and commodification of security. In his words: **[The
most obvious state intervention in capital accumulation through
counterterrorism policy was the construction of a peculiar sector of the
economy: the homeland security sector]{.underline}**. **[This sector did
not develop around a new kind of produce, but comprises the efforts of
existing sectors -- from armaments to pharmaceuticals, from finance to
the ever agile]{.underline}** (and recently bankrupt) **[IT -- to adjust
or merely rebrand their produce as security-related]{.underline}**.
(Boukalas 2015, this issue)

#### The plan continues an anxiety-driven approach that recreates fake crises and weaponizes counterterrorism to solidify state power

**Boukalas 15** (Christos Boukalas; political and law theorist, expert
on issues of counterterrorism law and policy. He teaches Law in
Northumbria University; 4/9/15; "Class war-on-terror: counterterrorism,
accumulation, crisis";

Conclusion: **[counterterrorism as pre-emption of political
crisis]{.underline}** We come therefore to understand **[the overall
contour of counterterrorism policy as the imposition of an effective ban
on popular politics]{.underline}**. The latter can be expressed only
inasmuch as it is granted permission or tacit tolerance by the state. In
effect, the state imposes a monopoly over (legitimate) politics, a
testament to the authoritarian hardening of its form. **[The political
exclusion of the population signifies that the state has become the
private affair of dominant capital]{.underline}**. Here again,
counterterrorism policy has been important in devising the structures
through which public money and, crucially, the capacity to make
political decisions is taken over by capital. This arrangement takes
place as **[capitalism enters a phase where the continuation of
accumulation]{.underline}** generates, and **[depends on,
crisis.]{.underline}** Throughout the neoliberal era, and across both
breadth and depth modes, **[capital accumulation is enabled by
dispossession]{.underline}**. This comprised, on the one hand, **[the
integra- tion of previously non-market social assets and]{.underline}**
relations into the circuit of capital: state- owned assets,
**[health]{.underline}**, **[education]{.underline}**,
**[land]{.underline}**, **[water]{.underline}**, art, culture, genetic
material, communal science, etc. -- all **[became expropriated by
private capital]{.underline}**, marking a "greenfield" expan- sion of
accumulation (Harvey 2003, 147--149). On the other hand, on the basis of
supply-side economics that conceptualise the wage as a cost of
production rather than a source of demand, workfare is the funda- mental
strategy of the neoliberal state. It **[entails material dispossession
of the population]{.underline}** through sustained pressures on pensions
and salaries, reduction of social entitlements and rights to welfare,
transportation, education, and health, and the degradation of public
infrastructures (Jessop 2002, 141--171, 250--254; Mackleavy 2010).
**[This]{.underline}** marks an intensification of accumulation and
**[results in the extreme concentration of wealth]{.underline}**, the
diffusion of **[poverty, and]{.underline}** the **[proliferation
of]{.underline}** highly **[exploitative]{.underline}** and precarious
**[labour relations.]{.underline}** This trend is further accentuated by
**[tax]{.underline}** and budgetary state **[policy]{.underline}**,
which systematically fails to tax capital, and instead **[gathers its
income mainly from workers]{.underline}** -- **[but then spends tax
money not on social welfare or education, but on handouts to capital and
services primarily beneficial to the rich (such as security,
safeguarding of intellectual property, or war).]{.underline}** Thus, the
**[state budget has become a mechanism that expropriates wealth from
society and hands it over to capital]{.underline}** (Demirović 2009, 46;
Kotz 2011, 1; Stiglitz 2012, 71--74). Along these lines,
financialisation was generated by workfarism and material dispos-
session, which made access to consumer goods, health and education
dependent on financial sector credit; and state policy forced pension
and social insurance funds to enter the financial market in order to
survive. While dependent on dispossession, finan- cialisation opened, at
the same time, new pastures of accumulation and became the primary
source of capitalist profitability until, in 2007, its crisis erupted
(Lapavitsas 2013). It seems therefore that **[neoliberal capitalism is
haunted by a fundamental contra- diction. The more successful its core
strategy of wealth concentration]{.underline}** through devaluation of
labour and life, **[the more difficult capital accumulation becomes: as
fewer and fewer people can afford fewer and fewer
commodities]{.underline}**, the realisation of capital becomes
increasingly implausible and accumulation is reduced to mere amassment
of wealth (Harvey 2010, 118, 2014, 169; Kotz 2011, 1, 2012, 2013, 6;
Piketty 2014, 297; Stiglitz 2012, 85--89). Accordingly, **[the overall
role of the capitalist state is to manage the crisis while advancing the
strategies that cause it.]{.underline}** It has managed to do so with
exceptional ingenuity and success for over a decade now, by postponing,
ameliorating, and dislocating crises and their effects -- for instance,
the crisis of 2000--2001 was over- come by the throwing of public money
at private capital, while the continuing dispossession of the population
was countered by the mass provision of cheap credit; this led to the
2007--2011 crisis, which, in turn, was soon transformed from a
US-centred crisis of the financial sector to one of (especially
European) public sector debt. The wave of violent pauperisation of
populations across the core capitalist countries that resulted from the
management of the public debt crisis led to a new round of accumulation
through dispossession: the remaining state assets are pilfered by
capital; the last fortress of organised labour, the public sector, is
smashed; the rate of exploitation intensifies; and dominant capital
(especially in finance) amasses record profits -- thus laying the
groundwork for the next crisis of capital realisation (Crouch 2011, 112;
Demirović 2009; Harvey 2014, 177; Lapavitsas 2014, 214--215, 271--305;
Mirowski 2013, 170). **[As economic crises come in quick
succession]{.underline}** and the management of each accentuates the
factors leading to the next, there is no complete recovery between them.
**[The subaltern classes certainly do not return to pre-crisis levels
and, wary of lack of overall demand, capitalists are reluctant to
invest]{.underline}** (Demirović 2009, 56; Irvin 2008, 138--140; Kotz
2012, 14--15, 2014, 2). **[This]{.underline}** makes bubbles the only
path toecovery, **[turning capitalism into a stop--start
system]{.underline}** (Kotz 2013, 5; Stiglitz 2012, 85--89). **[The
process of capital accumulation is recast as a circle of
crisis]{.underline}**. While (usually orchestrated) crises are an ideal
vehicle for imposing upon societies the expropriation and dispossession
vital for accumulation (Klein 2007), it also seems that **[crisis has
also become a method for accumulation]{.underline}** (Bichler and Nitzan
2013; Crouch 2011, 101; Demirović 2009, 56; Harvey 2010, 246; Kotz 2011,
2). In any case, it seems that neoliberalism has nothing to offer but
crisis. **[Marketisation drasti- cally undermines the education system,
material infrastructure and long-term-oriented research, making very
unlikely the prospects of a new economic revolution]{.underline}** (like
the publicly funded, privately appropriated cybernetics one) (Demirović
2009, 50, 2012, 242; Stiglitz 2012, 93); **[the capture of the state by
capital]{.underline}** precludes the advancement of strategies for
long-term social reproduction under capitalism; the advent of neo-
rentier capitalism (Harvey 2014, 179; Lapavitsas 2014, 147--148; Piketty
2014, 195--198, 232--233, 418--429) **[is parasitic, unstable, and
dependent on state force]{.underline}**; and, the recent financial
crisis and its transformation to one of public debt show a sudden
thickening of contradictions as the power of capital to exploit society
reaches its asymptotes (Harvey 2014, 235--245; Bichler and Nitzan 2012).
Given its persis- tence on the neoliberal route, economic **[crisis
seems to be a permanent condition and the only horizon of
capitalism]{.underline}**. Yet, **[economic crises are the health of
capitalism: they help it rearrange strategies, fine- tune practices,
cannibalise capital, advance technologies, rearrange alliances, proceed
to new rounds of dispossession]{.underline}**, and so on. Economic
crisis becomes dangerous for capit- alism only when it metastasises into
a political one -- a crisis of social and political practices,
institutions, relations and values. If, at present, capitalism can
promise nothing but anxiety and devastation, the question of what use it
is for society may arise -- and this must be prevented by all means.
**[This is precisely what counterterrorism helps to
achieve]{.underline}**. On the one hand, **[it has been instrumental in
setting up structures]{.underline}** and modalities that permit the
constant reproduction of economic crisis, **[by enabling the state to
manage it through ad hoc, rapid and unrest- rained Executive action,
determined at interpersonal forums by top Executive
personnel]{.underline}** and top capital representatives, and sold to
the population as the only way to avoid impending doom; on the other
hand, it enables the state to fend off the mutation of an economic
crisis to a political one -- **[through the stigmatisation of
antagonistic politics, their constant monitoring by the police, and
their repression once they break onto the public sphere.
Counterterrorism is a main part of the pre-emptive armoury of capitalism
in the face of looming political crisis]{.underline}**.

### Government Accountability Link

#### State practices are consistently defined by a protection of ruling class interests -- reforms lend legitimacy to a corrupt apparatus that has empirically refused any meaningful restraint on its power.

State: The End of Separation of Powers," *Monthly Review*, 66:3,

**[No one could]{.underline}** sensibly **[claim that these principles
of transparency and accountability were]{.underline}** uniformly
**[applied in the decades after they were first
formulated]{.underline}**. These were promises that the new regime made
to the people generally. **[As promises, they were hedged]{.underline}**
about **[with limitations and conditions at the outset, and then in
practice proved to be difficult to enforce]{.underline}**. **[These were
promises fashioned as instruments of bourgeois state power, setting out
an idea that the state would stand as neutral guardian of principle,
when in fact it was prepared to act as an instrument of social
control]{.underline}**. But **[while the promises could never be wholly
realized, keeping them gave state power its perceived
legitimacy.]{.underline}** **[That]{.underline}**, in general terms,
**[is the way of]{.underline}** parliamentary
**[democracy]{.underline}**. **[Organs of state power remain open to
influence; a set of declared rights is more or less guaranteed. It is
not, therefore, surprising that]{.underline}** Chief Justice Marshall
himself wrote **[the Supreme Court]{.underline}** opinions that
**[denied judicial review to Native Americans and African
slaves]{.underline}**. After all, the Constitution itself accepted the
institution of slavery and provided that: "Representatives and direct
Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be
included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which
shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons,
including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding
Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons." That is, a slave
was three‐fifths of a person for the purpose of allocating Congressional
seats, though without a vote or any of the political rights defined in
the Constitution. Native Americans did not exist for purposes of taxes
and representation, although the Congress would certainly legislate as
to their status. In the early nineteenth century, Native Americans
sought to assert their rights. As I wrote in Law & the Rise of
Capitalism: The Cherokee Nation of Georgia adopted a written
constitution and asserted sovereignty over its land. The Georgia
legislature responded by declaring Cherokee laws and customs void and
opening Cherokee land to settlement. The federal Congress, at the urging
of President Andrew Jackson, passed legislation seeking to compel Native
Americans to give up and move westward. Georgia authorities arrested,
tried, and hanged a Cherokee for an offense allegedly committed on
Cherokee territory. The Cherokee Nation sought relief in the courts.
They were, after all, a nation. They sought to restrain the enforcement
of Georgia laws which "go directly to annihilate the Cherokees as a
political society, and to seize, for the use of Georgia, the lands of
the nation which have been assured to them by the United States in
solemn treaties repeatedly made and still in force." The Cherokees'
lawyer invoked the Supreme Court's power, saying that the lawsuit was
between a foreign nation---the Cherokee--- and the state of Georgia.
Under the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court could exercise
its original jurisdiction over such a lawsuit without waiting for lower
courts to decide it and then hearing the case on appeal. Chief Justice
Marshall looked to the constitutional grant to Congress of the power to
regulate commerce with "foreign nations, and among the several states,
and with the Indian tribes." He found the Cherokee to be "a domestic,
dependent nation" that was "in a state of pupilage," like "that of a
ward to his guardian." It was not, he said, for the Court a true
"foreign nation." Thus, the Cherokee Nation had no legal existence. It
could not even come to a federal court to vindicate its treaty rights.
The Supreme Court decided Cherokee Nation v. Georgia in 1830, over the
dissents of Justices Story and Thompson. Two years later, in Worcester
v. Georgia, Chief Justice Marshall retreated a bit, and held that
Georgia did not have the right to regulate activities on the Cherokee
lands. He did not reach this result by recognizing the position of the
Cherokee Nation, but by denying the right of a state such as Georgia to
interfere in matters that are essentially federal. That is, the national
government had the constitutional power to deal with Native Americans
and the states had only a limited role to play. Marshall spoke for the
Supreme Court on the issue of slavery in an 1825 case, The Antelope. The
Constitution had forbidden Congress to regulate importation of "persons"
until 1808. In a statute that took effect January 1, 1808, the Congress
prohibited importation of slaves. Nonetheless, the slave trade
continued, and in 1820, a U.S. coast guard vessel boarded and seized a
ship, The Antelope, that was carrying 225 African slaves. The Antelope
was taken into port on suspicion that the slaves were destined to be
imported into the United States. Here was a chance for Marshall, who
acknowledged that slavery was "contrary to the laws of nature," to
translate this sense of injustice into a judicial command. However, he
noted that "Christian and civilized" nations still engaged in the slave
trade and that it could not therefore be said to be unlawful; the slaves
were not to be set free but rather returned to their owners. Marshall's
failure to find controlling international law is the more surprising
because the United States had agreed in the 1814 Treaty of Ghent to seek
an end to the international slave trade. **[For Marshall and his
colleagues on the Supreme Court, Native Americans did not exist as
holders or bearers of rights, and the status of slavery was not an issue
that the law could address]{.underline}**. To complete the story, one
must note the Court's 1841 decision in The Amistad. Between 1825 and
1841, treaties and customary international law had shifted the legal
landscape. The Amistad was a Spanish ship carrying forty‐nine slaves.
The slaves took command of the ship, which eventually anchored off Long
Island. The legal proceedings eventually reached the Supreme Court. The
Spanish and British governments tried to exercise influence on the case:
the British said that the capture of the slaves in Africa violated a
treaty between Britain and Spain. Spain said the slaves were property
and should be returned. The Supreme Court argument, led by John Quincy
Adams, stressed that judicial review and not executive branch concerns
should be the guiding principle of decision. On March 9, 1841, Justice
Story delivered the Supreme Court's opinion holding that the slaves must
be freed. Any hope that was kindled by the Amistad decision was
extinguished by the Dred Scott decision in 1857. **[The Supreme Court's
decision that Dred Scott was not entitled to freedom from slavery
despite having been taken into free territory was based upon an
assertion that echoed the rationale of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia.
African slaves and their descendants could not be "citizens" of any
state and were therefore not entitled to be heard in federal court. They
were,]{.underline}** the Court said, "**[beings of an inferior order,
and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social
or political relations, and so far inferior that they had no rights
which the white man was bound to respect]{.underline}**." That is, it
**[was not only the political institution of slavery that forbade
judicial review, but a theory that those of African descent were
inferior beings destined to be ruled without voice as to their
condition]{.underline}**. Chief Justice Taney, who wrote the majority
opinion, and President James Buchanan, who was given advance notice of
what the Court would do, thought that the Dred Scott decision would end
the controversy about slavery. Of course, it did nothing of the kind,
but rather made a military solution inevitable. **[Thus]{.underline}**,
in 1857, **[for white male citizens, judicial review of governmental
action was presumptively available. However, judicial review stopped
short when a litigant challenged a system of social
relations]{.underline}**. The conquest and subjugation of Native
Americans was a fundamental tenet of British, French, Spanish, and then
U.S. occupation of the Eastern seaboard and then of Westward expansion.
By definition Native Americans were not to be considered as bearers of
rights that could be enforced against the state. And Taney's statement
came at the end of a long pseudo‐historical analysis that justified the
institution of slavery as a part of the social fabric. T h e S e p a r a
t i o n o f P o w e r s A f t e r 1 8 5 7 The Civil War amendments to
the Constitution abolished slavery and provided for equal protection of
the laws. It would be nearly a century before the promise of those
amendments began to be fulfilled by the Supreme Court. For
African‐Americans, the Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education
recognized the promise that the 14th Amendment equal protection clause
indisputably made. The Marbury‐Gilchrist‐Burr model, as limited in
Cherokee Nation and Dred Scott, posits a right of access to review of
governmental action. Presumptively, the courts will provide review. In a
narrow class of cases, that review must be obtained through a political
process. Nobody can rationally claim that either of these avenues of
redress is efficient. Most of the significant cases about "rights" have
been brought and litigated by labor, civil rights, and civil liberties
organizations---the cost of what passes for justice is too great for
most people. Of course, **[those who wind up in court testing their
rights as criminal defendants will have counsel provided but the
deficiencies of that system are well‐known. The electoral political
process is dominated by money, and is in many ways impossibly
corrupt]{.underline}**. **[The point]{.underline}**, however, **[is that
the state has]{.underline}** assiduously **[maintained the fiction that
both of these avenues of redress are in fact viable. In order for this
fiction to have any semblance of credibility, the institutions of
redress must be seen to have some utility. The lawyer for the oppressed
points to the promises and principles in the legal ideology of the
dominant class, and argues for their application in ways that may
contradict the interests of that class. Significant victories have been
won for workers, women, people of color, political dissidents, and gay
and lesbian people---in the judicial, executive, and legislative
arenas]{.underline}**. The courtroom battles for these rights produced
significant victories in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, and helped to
empower movements for social change. **[In the midst of these battles,
there were disturbing signs]{.underline}** that Patrick Henry's
forebodings---a President at the head of an army, and therefore
indisposed to heed the commands of a Chief Justice---would be realized.
And what if a President's refusal to "do what Mr. Chief Justice will
order him" was a problem compounded by Mr. Chief Justice's timidity and
moral obliquity? That is, what if Mr. Chief Justice---in the pattern of
Marshall in Cherokee Nation or Taney in Dred Scott---were to acquiesce
in declaring a "no law" zone because of the character of a claim or of
the claimant? In such a case, **[the structure of separation of powers
might crumble, not by conquest---but by surrender.]{.underline}** By way
of example, **[the Supreme Court upheld the internment of
Japanese‐Americans during the Second World War, yielding to an exercise
of Presidential power]{.underline}** that was later held to have been
improper and based upon false assumptions. Some of the Court's decisions
on freedom of expression and association during the Cold War period
failed to respect freedoms of speech and association. Yet, there were
bright spots, as when the Supreme Court upheld the academic freedom of
Monthly Review editor Paul Sweezy. **[The years since September 11,
2001, have witnessed a significant shift in the role of the executive
and judicial branches. In the militarized national security state, the
dismantling of the constitutional separation of powers has largely come
to pass]{.underline}**. We can see how this has happened, as a matter of
state power and legal ideology. **[Two legal devices have been deployed
to shut off accountability for governmental wrongdoing. The first of
these is a judicially created doctrine of non‐decision---the "political
question doctrine." The second is the state secrets privilege, the
invocation of which forestalls all accountability because the rationale
and details of government conduct are hidden from public
view]{.underline}**. Let us examine these in turn.

### Gulf Conflict Link

#### The 1AC reifies a neoliberal security narrative that legitimizes US intervention in the name of Gulf stability 

**Morrissey 10** (John Morrissey; Department of Geography, National
University of Ireland; 2010; Antipode Vol. 43 No. 3 2011 ISSN 0066-4812,

**[Neoliberal Securitization Returning to the question of geoeconomic
securitization]{.underline}**, Central Command CINC General James
Binford Peay III declared to the House **[Appropriations Committee
Subcommittee]{.underline}** on National Security in 1997 **[that any
disruption in the flow of petroleum from the Persian Gulf would
"precipitate economic calamity for developed and developing nations
alike"]{.underline}**. His successor at CENTCOM, General Anthony Zinni,
affirmed the command's primary role in averting such a scenario by
emphatically underlining its geoeconomic mission in his 1998 report to
the Senate Armed Services Committee: America's interests in \[the
Central Region\] reflect our beliefs in access to free markets, the
Middle East Peace Process, protection of and access to regional energy
resources, and reduce \[sic\] the proliferation of conventional and mass
destruction weapons. The vast quantities of oil, gas, and other
resources present in the gulf region, which includes 69 percent of the
world's known oil reserves plus significant natural gas fields, are
essential to today's global economies. Much of the oil exported from the
Arabian Gulf countries passes through at least one of three important
maritime choke points: the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal, or the Bab
el Mandeb between Yemen and Eritrea (US Central Command CINC General
Anthony C Zinni 1998). Zinni was interviewed by the US military's
flagship journal, Joint Force Quarterly, the following year. He was
initially asked what "basic considerations" underpin CENTCOM theater
strategy. Here is his revealing reply: Our theater strategy is built
\[on\] four elements. The first is obvious--- providing access to the
energy resources of the region, which is a vital national interest. The
second element is something often overlooked--- the growing commercial
significance of the area. The pattern of global trade is shifting from
east to west. Investments are flowing into the region because of its
geostrategic position. The third is the number of maritime choke points
in the region, such as the Suez Canal and Strait of Hormuz. We must
ensure these passages remain open to communication and trade. Fourth,
there are issues of stability---the Middle East peace process,
extremism, and other concerns that could destabilize the region and
reach beyond it (Joint Force Quarterly Forum 2000). In official
geopolitical discourse, CENTCOM CINCs have succeeded in perennially
convincing Congress of the need for an ongoing neoliberal securitization
project in the Persian Gulf region. And over the last 25 years, Central
Command's securitization discourse winning out in **[the corridors of
political and military power in Washington has been mirrored by an
exponential growth in CENTCOM's ground presence across the region that
has facilitated the vital nodes of power to secure geoeconomic
calculation]{.underline}**. In the early 1980s, apart from the Indian
Ocean atoll of Diego Garcia, located over 2000 miles south of the
Persian Gulf, the US military held no bases anywhere in the Middle East.
Today, **[in the aftermath of]{.underline}** the **[Iraq]{.underline}**
invasion, **[involvement in Afghanistan and broader execution of the war
on terror]{.underline}**, CENTCOM **[holds at least 128 operational
bases acros]{.underline}**s its AOR (Morrissey forthcoming b; US Central
Command Director of Logistics Major General Brian Geehan 2006). **[A
preemptive geopolitical and geoeconomic logic of risk management
underpins the current US overseas basing strategy]{.underline}**. The
Overseas Basing Commission reported to Congress in 2005, for example,
that: The U.S. overseas basing structure must serve both in the near
term and for decades to come. \[Bases\] cannot be oriented to dealing
only with current threats. They must have the capacity to deal with
threats that will emerge in decades to come \... None of us can predict
the future. That, however, is enough to remind us that any base
structuring cannot be designed to deal only with the threats of today.
The base structure we develop in the near future must enable us to meet
the threats that will emerge over the next quarter century and beyond
(2005:iii, 6--7). The Commission went on to cite the example of
"Operation Vigilant Warrior" in 1994 ("to respond to renewed Iraqi
aggression against Kuwait") and "Operation Iraqi Freedom" in 2003 ("to
secure Iraq's oil fields") to expound the vital importance of
"maintaining a forward presence" for CENTCOM's geopolitical and
geoeconomic mission (2005:G2). **[And this military-economic
securitization discourse has been echoed relentlessly in US strategic
studies by an influential assemblage of foreign policy institutes,
defense think-tanks and specialist university and college
departments]{.underline}** (Morrissey forthcoming a); what Bradley Klein
(1988) calls Washington's "strategic culture". A year before the war in
Iraq was launched, **[Sami Hajjar at the Strategic Studies Institute of
the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, scripted the
following aleatory scenario]{.underline}** for the Persian Gulf and the
**[subsequent necessity of permanent US military
intervention]{.underline}**: **[In addition to Iraq, the Gulf region is
likely to remain fundamentally unstable for several decades to come
\...In other words, there is no realistic end in the foreseeable future
to U.S. military engagement in the Gulf. The vital interests the United
States has in the region]{.underline}** \... and the inability of Japan
and European powers that depend on Middle East oil to project power for
a long period of time, mean that U.S. engagement is there for the long
haul. The Army should plan accordingly, for an over-the-horizon presence
strategy is no longer valid \... land power is, in the final analysis,
what will secure the world's most precious and coveted real estate
(2002:57--58). Hajjar's argument about the import of "land power" is
significant I think. Much of the recent work on geoeconomics points to
how, as Deborah Cowen and Neil Smith put it, **[the "acquisition or
control of territory" is more of "a tactical option rather than a
strategic necessity" in terms of the "accumulation of wealth through
market control"]{.underline}** (2009:42). And they are certainly correct
in seeing that accumulation as enabled "through imperial violence"
(2009:44). However, while **[geoeconomics]{.underline}** does not rely
on territorial control in the colonial sense, it **[does rely on "land
nodes" in the imperial sense, in which bases, logistic facilities and
pre-positioning sites enable key policing and deterrence practices of
securitization and regulation. Territorial access, in other words, is
still vital for geoeconomics]{.underline}**; which seems to me an
important point conspicuously absent in many of the recent rather
ageographical reflections on "globalization" and "empire" (Friedman
2005; Hardt and Negri 2000). This "geography still matters in
international relations" assertion is part of Matt Sparke's argument
about an "American dominance" defined in terms of "global systems
management geared to removing security impediments from the global level
playing field" (2007:345). Sparke's point is that the US neoconservative
designs for "military intervention" in Iraq were combined from the start
with neoliberal hopes to "enable the invisible hand of the free market
to tip dominos of democracy and freedom right across the Middle East"
(2007:345); that is, Iraq becoming "the rock upon which the United
States projects power" (Thayer 2003:23). And neoliberal designs for
swift economic reconstruction and realignment were certainly part of
both the pre-planning and initial security operations of the war in Iraq
(Klein 2007). A month before George W. Bush's premature "Mission
Accomplished" address aboard USS Abraham Lincoln in early May 2003, and
a mere 2weeks after the war had been launched, the "Operations and
Reconstruction" hearings of Operation Iraqi Freedom had already
commenced before the House Committee on Armed Services back in
Washington (US House Committee on Armed Services 2003). Echoing Sparke's
contention above, Simon Dalby, in reading the 2005 US National Defense
Strategy in parallel with the works of popular foreign policy
commentators, Thomas Barnett and Robert Kaplan, has argued that official
and popular US geopolitical discourse collectively reveal a "broad
complementarity" of "imperial military action" and "neo-liberal
globalisation" (2007:586). The 2006 US National Security Strategy
further bears out this logic. Out of its nine thematic chapters, four of
them address economic and globalization issues that the Bush
administration saw as vital to both US national security and the
stability of the world economy (US National Security Council 2006). The
2006 National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism can also
be cited in divulging **[the US military's broad mission of "neoliberal
securitization".8 In it, the positing of terrorist strategy is
juxtaposed in irrational opposition to the security and economic logic
of US military strategy]{.underline}**: Extremists use terrorism to
impede and undermine political progress, economic prosperity, the
security and stability of the international state system \... The United
States will promote freedom, democracy, and economic prosperity around
the world to mitigate those conditions that terrorists seek to exploit.9
**[It is this dual military-economic logic that has defined the
securitization project of US Central Command for nearly three
decades]{.underline}**. Successive CENTCOM CINCs have perennially
extolled the command's role in policing "regional stability and
security" in a space scripted ad infinitum as "integral to the political
and economic wellbeing of the international community" (Binford Peay III
1995:32). And CENTCOM's selfdeclared mission, espoused in its annual
posture statements, has been to "protect the United States' vital
interest in the region---uninterrupted, secure U.S./Allied access to
Gulf oil" (US Central Command 1995:1). **[To this end, the negotiation
of vital Status of Forces Agreements, a proactive military
pre-positioning programme and frequent wargaming and combat exercises
have combined to facilitate a "continuous presence" in the Persian Gulf
to "deter conflict, promote stability, and facilitate a seamless
transition to war]{.underline}**, if required" (US Central Command
1997:5). **[This is the neoliberal securitization project of US
CENTCOM---where strategy and economics are enabled, regulated and
insured against]{.underline}**.

### Human Rights

#### Protecting human rights denies the role capitalism plays in exploiting others for profit

**TUMINO 2** (Stephen Tumino; Professor in the English department at
Bourough of Manhattan Community College; May/June 2002; "Contesting the
Empire-al Imaginary: The Truth of Democracy as Class"
<http://www.redcritique.org/MayJune02/contestingtheempirealimaginary.htm>)

**[The \"moral\" story about protecting human rights is told to cover up
the material truth about democracy being the freedom to exploit others
for profit.]{.underline}** **[The story is needed to alibi the regime of
wage-labor and capital as a fact of nature. In other words, it portrays
the normal daily exploitation of labor under capitalism as the free
expression of human nature in comparison with which its everyday
brutality is made to appear \"extreme\" and \"irrational\" rather than a
socially necessary consequence of private property]{.underline}**. The
representation of capitalism as natural is of course not natural at all
but historical**[: it is needed now to manufacture consensus that
capitalism cannot be changed at a time when it is obvious that the
material conditions already exist to abolish class
inequality.]{.underline}** **[As Venezuela shows, it is obvious that
what stands in the way of a regime directed toward meeting people\'s
needs, which is what Chavez represents, is not a lack of respect for
human rights by immoral and corrupt people of the South, but the need of
big business for a bigger share of the world market]{.underline}**. It
was the US oil giants represented by the Bush regime, supported by the
trade union bureaucracy in this country, that aided the
counter-revolutionary coup in Venezuela (e.g., by fomenting the oil
workers strike as the core of a \"civil society\" movement that tried to
abolish the popular social reforms of the Chavez government). It is for
profit not democracy that the US supported the reactionary coup to
overthrow Chavez (not just in words but with financial aid, military
weapons and advisors as the British Guardian has reported); it is for
profit and not for democracy that the US supports Israel and is
currently colonizing Afghanistan as preparation for taking Iraq.It is
obvious that the Bush regime is guided by profit and not democracy,
which is why global public opinion is everywhere outside the US opposed
to US \"unilateralism\" and \"empire\" building**[. This growing
\"obviousness\" of democracy as hegemony of the rich threatens the
ideology of capitalism by exposing democracy as the bourgeois freedom to
exploit the labor and resources of the world.]{.underline}** **[It is
also behind the formation of a transnational populist left, however,
that goes along with the system of wage labor and capital by marking the
obvious hoax of democracy but nevertheless channeling the opposition
into a reformist politics to maintain capitalism]{.underline}**. By
merely contesting its obviously barbaric effects rather than engage in a
radical critique of capitalism for a social revolution against
wage-slavery that is the cause of the effects, the left supports the
ideology of democracy as class rule**[. It thus goes along with the
reactionary backlash to make social contradictions into problems of
\"governance\" and \"policy\" of \"unruly\" subjects---the powerless are
made to bear responsibility for the contradictions of class
society]{.underline}**. What is emerging in the wake of the
revolutionary explosions in Latin America is the growing awareness that
it is becoming impossible to simply deny the basic truth of Marxism on
democracy as class inequality. As a result, newer mystifications of
capitalism and why it changes are also emerging to stabilize the status
quo. **[The dominant mode of naturalizing capitalism is to represent the
new social struggles as spontaneous movements of the oppressed, by
denying that they are a product of history as class struggle over the
conditions of production. Rather than produce awareness of the class
interests behind the emerging struggles the populist left portrays them
as the outcome of spontaneous rebellions of the people against power. It
is thus on the left most of all that one finds the alibi of capitalism
as democracy that proposes capitalism may be reformed while the
exploitation at its root remains intact. A reformed capitalism is simply
a code for a more efficient regime of exploitation and imperialist
brutality---it is appeasement of the violent democracy of the
owners.]{.underline}**

### Iran Link

#### Capitalist expansionism makes Iranian conflict inevitable

**Berberoglu et al 12** (Berch Berberoglu; Professor and Director of
Graduate Studies in Sociology at the University of Nevada, Reno, Ph.D.
in sociology from the University of Oregon; 2012; "Beyond the Global

**[The contradictions of global capitalist expansion, which has caused
so much exploitation, oppression, and misery for the peoples of the
world, both in the lessdeveloped and in the imperialist countries
themselves, has in turn created the conditions for its own
downfall]{.underline}**. Economically, it has afflicted the system with
recessions, depressions, and associated realization crises; politically,
it has set into motion an imperial interventionist state that **[through
its presence in every corner of the world has incurred an enormous
military expenditure to maintain an empire, while gaining the resentment
of millions of people across the globe who are engaged in active
struggle against it.]{.underline}**2 **[The imperial capitalist state,
acting as the repressive arm of global capital and extending its rule
across vast territories, has dwarfed the militaristic adventures of past
empires many times over]{.underline}**. The global capitalist state,
**[through its political and military supremacy]{.underline}**, has come
to exert its control over many countries and **[has]{.underline}** thus
**[facilitated the exploitation of labor on a world
scale]{.underline}**. As a result, it has reinforced the domination of
capital over labor and its rule on behalf of capital. This, in turn, has
greatly politicized the struggle between labor and capital and called
for the recognition of the importance of political organization that
many find necessary to effect change in order to transform the global
capitalist system. **[The greatest voices are being heard in this regard
in countries most affected by the global capitalist
crisis]{.underline}**, in particular the southern European countries of
Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Italy, as well as Ireland and Iceland
further north. But, while there has developed a mass movement against
neoliberalism across Latin America over the past several decades, **[the
center of attention has quickly turned to the Middle East, as rebellion
and revolution have spread across North Africa, from Tunisia to Egypt
and the rest of the Middle East, including Yemen,]{.underline}**
Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, and **[Iran]{.underline}**. **[The
contradictions of the unfolding process of global expansion and
accumulation have brought to the fore new political realities: renewed
repression at home and abroad to control an increasingly frustrated
working class in the imperial heartland, and a militant and
revolutionary mass of workers and peasants in the Third World poised to
resist capitalist globalization]{.underline}** (Houtart and Polet 2001;
Petras and Veltmeyer 2001; Polet 2007**[). It is these inherent
contradictions of modern global capitalism that are making it
increasingly difficult for the imperial state to control and manage the
global political economy]{.underline}**, while at the same time
preparing the conditions for international solidarity of workers in
confronting global capital throughout the world.

### Militarism Link (SP2)

#### Their call for military based reductions of arms is too little too late -- commercial interests are still satisfied through illegal sales -- their universalizing appeals to ethics and rights just mask transnational capitalist interests at the heart of US policy.

**Kirk and Okazawa-Rey 2000** (Gwyn Kirk and Margo Okazawa-Rey;
scholar-activist concerned with gender, racial and environmental
justice; Winter 2000; Neoliberalism, Militarism, And Armed Conflict;
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29768029.pdf>)

Tamar Gabelnick and Anna Rich take up the issue of the arms trade in the
fifth article. They emphasize potential contradictions between security
policy and international arms sales, noting that [\"U.S. arms export
policy was established to protect national security, but has become
increasingly **focused on commercial interests**\" such that \"proposed
export reforms will lead to further loss of control over conventional
arms proliferation.\" An outcome of international sales is that
militaries can find themselves up against an enemy armed with weapons
provided by their own governments if political and military alliances
shift.]{.underline} This happened to Britain in the Falklands/Malvinas
war and to the United States in the Persian Gulf War. In an attempt to
reduce arms sales, U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney has proposed a
Code of Conduct that would restrict the sale of arms to countries that
are \"nondemocratic, aggressors, human rights abusers, or not open about
their military spending.\" This is a step in the right direction, but as
Gabelnick and Rich suggest, it will need to be applied consistently to
have much impact. The definitions of nondemocratic, aggression, or human
rights abuse are open to interpretation. Russia\'s assurance, for
example, \"that it will not sell offensive weapons to Iran despite
\[its\] decision.. .to resume arms sales to Teheran\" (Reuters, December
7, 2000: A16) suggests a clear-cut distinction between offensive and
defensive weapons that may be meaningless in practice. [Many countries
are involved in arms trading. Most people are killed by small arms that
are cheap and easily available worldwide, rather than by highly
sophisticated weaponry. A good deal of the cross-border trade in **small
arms is illegal**, but highly profitable for manufacturers, dealers,
brokers, shippers, and financiers]{.underline} (Lumpe, 2000). This trade
is an important way for poorer countries to earn hard currency to repay
foreign debt. Staples notes that \"foreign embassies and trade missions
abroad are used to aid arms sales,\" a point reiterated by Karen Talbot,
who argues that \"bombing and missile strikes, are, more than ever,
giant bazaars for selling the wares of the armaments manufacturers.\"
The Persian Gulf War and the bombing of Kosovo allowed stocks to be
displayed, tested, and reduced somewhat. William Greider (1998) argues
that there is no technical reason to update U.S. weapons ? the most
sophisticated in the world ? except for the need for continued profits.
He notes that the biggest enemy of future U.S. weapons production is the
copious supply of weapons already in existence; hence, the need to use
them so as to justify continued production. [Economic explanations for
militarism do not find their way into mainstream discourse and
reporting; rather, the focus is on ideological support for militarism.
As mentioned earlier, nation-states generate popular support for
\"defense\" mea? sures, supposedly to protect citizens from possible
attack?from inside or outside the country.]{.underline} The fall of the
Berlin wall precipitated a crisis of legitimacy for the United States
military with the demise of its long-term Soviet adversary. Although
peace organizations, liberal policymakers, and New York Times editorial
writers called for a \"peace dividend,\" [the Pentagon was quick to find
new military adventures to **justify high military spending** and
continued contracts to suppliers. Examples include the Persian Gulf War,
the military\'s self-imposed international policing role allegedly to
maintain human rights, and the \"war on drugs.\" Throughout the 1990s,
the U.S. used the \"war on drugs\" as a rationale for military
operations]{.underline} and widespread spraying of herbicides in
Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. In June 2000, Congress approved \$1.3
billion in military aid for Colombia ? Plan Colombia ? ostensibly for
counternarcotics operations. Much of that money will go directly to U.S.
contractors who make the weaponry and aircraft required by the plan.
Page (2000) argues that the \"Black Hawk gunships alone represent a
\$234 million contract for Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. of Connecticut.\" In
the ninth article, Justin Delacour argues that Plan Colombia is a
pretext for a counterinsurgency strategy, and that the U.S. is
strengthening a repressive regime that has used paramilitaries in brutal
attacks on civilians and the leftist Revolution? ary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), who oppose privatization of state-owned companies and
infrastructure. He argues that U.S. policy in Colombia has the support
of weapons producers (United Technologies and Bell Helicopter Textron),
oil companies (BP-Amoco and Occidental Petroleum), and the U.S. energy
group, Enron, which is interested in buying Colombia\'s state-run power
generator. [According to Delacour, as long as there is high demand for
drugs in wealthy This content downloaded from Kirk and Okazawa-Rey
countries like the United States and a lack of viable economic options
in poorer countries like Colombia, the trafficking of illegal narcotics
will continue to thrive, driven by systemic inequalities in wealth and
living standards. Like the trade in arms, the drug trade is a lucrative
earner of hard currency for producers and those who procure and sell
them.]{.underline} Delacour\'s analysis of U.S. press coverage of
Colombia shows how mainstream media outlets have relied on official U.S.
sources for their news reports, partly due to threats from the U.S.
Embassy in Bogota that reporters would be banned from embassy-sponsored
briefings unless the embassy approved of their coverage. He shows how
biased and simplistic reporting serves to generate ideological support
for U.S. policy at home. Delacour\'s article provides a detailed example
for the more general argument developed by Tony Ward and Penny Green in
the following piece. **[They seek to provide a theoretical framework for
understanding the dynamics of state crime ? such as genocide, torture,
and war crimes ? and how the seemingly universal discourse of human
rights is often used to mask particular economic agendas.]{.underline}**
These **[authors extend Gramsci\'s analysis of the concept of hegemony
to interna? tional relations and argue that the \"U.S. and its allies
exercise hegemony in a Gramscian sense]{.underline}**: [their dominance
appears to serve universal interests, rather than the interests of
transnational capital, because it is **portrayed as upholding human
rights** and democracy.\"]{.underline}

### Norms Link

#### Regulative norms of arms sales under neoliberalism are used to legitimize violent interventions

**[From "Good" Norms and Discrete Initiatives to Arms Control as
Governmentality The proliferation of post-Cold War initiatives to regu-
late the arms trade has prompted a discussion]{.underline}** about the
relationship between norms, HAC, and arms trade regulation. In this
section, I identify different schools of thinking that have emerged in
the literature---the norm optimists who are positive about the impact of
HAC and the skeptics who are more dubious. The latter can be further
subdivided into those who suggest **[humanitarian arms trade norms are
trumped by material interest and those who, alternatively, see "good"
norms balanced by "bad" norms.]{.underline}** In addition, some skeptics
have empha- sized **[the need to locate]{.underline}** both good and bad
**[arms trade norms within the broader practices, logics, and power re-
lations expressed in what has been labeled arms control as
governmentality]{.underline}** (Krause 2011). I conclude this section by
delineating the elements of arms control as govern- mentality relevant
to this paper. Norms are commonly understood as "collective ex-
pectations for the proper behaviour of actors with a given identity"
(Katzenstein 1996, 5; Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 89). Norms can be
promoted using a variety of means and by a variety of actors, but
adoption of a new norm can be facilitated when it is nested within
(Bower 2015) or grafted onto existing norms either through "ma-
nipulative persuasion" or "the contingency of genealog- ical heritage"
(Price 1998, 617). Indeed, the presence of mutually reinforcing and
consistent norms works to strengthen each set of norms (Finnemore 1996,
161). Norms can be prohibitive (constraining behavior), per- missive
(allowing behavior), or prescriptive (requiring be- havior) (Glanville
2006, 155). **[Norms can also be subdivided into regulative and
constitutive norms]{.underline}**; the former establish standards for
the proper enactment of an already defined identity (Bjo ̋ rkdahl 2002,
20). For rationalists in particular, norms operate at this shallow
level, creating consequen- tialist logics in which actors essentially
adhere to norms for instrumental reasons (Farrell 2005, 8--9). For con-
structivists, norms can also be constitutive in the sense that they
create new identities and interests for actors whilst also being shaped
by preexisting identities and in- terests. Norms, ideas, and interests
thus interact recur- sively, leading some to argue that the attempt to
sep- arate norms from interests is "fundamentally flawed" (Bjo ̋rkdahl
2002, 20). As will be indicated below, this suggests that those skeptics
who focus on the way declaratory arms trade norms appear to be trumped
by the material interests of states might simply be ignoring alternative
sets of norms and ideas shaping particular conceptions of interest. In
addition, critical international relations scholars such as MacKenzie
and Sessay (2012) have criticized liberal constructivists for assuming
norms such as those on transitional justice emerge from equal exchanges
and relationships rather than reflecting pro- found economic and
political inequalities. Indeed, they suggest the emphasis on norms as
signals of appropri- ateness "should be viewed as practical sirens
warning of imperialism" (ibid., 147). The arms trade norms debate is
characterized by a division between optimists and pessimists.
Interestingly, optimists include those who claim the mantle of con-
structivism (Wizotski 2009; Garcia 2015) or critical in- ternational
relations/security studies (Borrie 2014) just as much as the pessimists
do. The optimistic school ar- gues the post-Cold War era has witnessed
the novel in- troduction of inherently benevolent humanitarian or hu-
man security norms into the regulation of the arms trade (Axworthy 2001,
20, 23; Centre for Humanitarian Dia- logue 2003; Borrie 2006; Kyto ̋
mäki 2015, 2, 4). **[This, it is argued, has resulted in the creation of
new prohibitory arms trade norms that imply either a more restrictive
ap- proach to arms exports or, at the very least, a more re- strictive
approach to "irresponsible" arms exports. F]{.underline}**or example,
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted of the UN
ATT that "states have never before signed an international treaty that
aimed to reg- ulate the arms trade, with the express purpose of re-
ducing human suffering" (ICRC 2013, emphasis added). **[As will be
demonstrated below, such claims are just historically
wrong]{.underline}**. Although far more sophisticated in her analyses,
Garcia (2015, 7) has not only argued **[initiatives on small arms can be
understood as part of a series of "novel" humanitarian security regimes
but also that these are different from traditional arms control
instruments that "took a purely regulatory approach."]{.underline}** In
contrast, these new humanitarian security regimes have established new
international norms driven by altruistic imperatives, are "about
everyone's security," and have "restructured" conceptions of national
interest (ibid., 61). In this view, post-Cold War "norm-mongers" have
not just circum- scribed the "warmongers" but have established new con-
stitutive norms with far-reaching effects on international actors'
understanding of their identities and interests. Others acknowledge that
humanitarian campaigns ex- tract specific initiatives on individual
weapons from the broader complex of war and militarism but suggest this
is a strategic campaigning device that can hide more radical agendas
(Bolton and Minor 2016). In this variant of op- timism, action on small
arms can be understood as part of an incrementalist, "one technology at
a time" route to disarmament and antimilitarism (Stavrianakis 2016,
844). The reconstruction of identities and interests is, therefore, just
around the corner. **[Such optimistic assessments have led to a small
but burgeoning literature on the phenomenon of post-Cold War HAC or
"humanitarian disarmament."]{.underline}** This label not only covers
action on small arms but also initiatives on landmines, cluster
munitions, and even recent human- itarian initiatives to ban nuclear
weapons (Thakur and Maley 1999; Borrie and Randin 2006; Wizotski 2009,
2013, 3; Borrie 2014, 626; Ritchie 2014; Bolton and Minor 2016; Minor
2015). Historicizing the drivers and outcomes of early examples of HAC,
therefore, has impli- cations for our understanding of the
transformative po- tential inherent in present-day HAC/ humanitarian
disar- mament initiatives. The pessimistic school encompasses a number
of dif- ferent positions. First, some suggest that **[arms trade policy
may be characterized as a form of organized hypocrisy]{.underline}**
under which declaratory commitments to pro- hibitory norms and/or the
socially constructed rep- utational concerns of states are frequently
trumped by material interests (Perkins and Neumayer 2010; Efrat 2012,
289--91; Erickson 2013, 2015; Hansen and Marsh 2015; Hansen 2016). In
this perspective, **[state policy reflects the outcomes of clashes
between rela- tively weak regulative arms trade norms and material
interests]{.underline}**. An alternative pessimistic approach takes more
seri- ously the constructivist claim that norms are not just reg-
ulative but can also be constitutive of identity and in- terests. It
therefore shares some similarity with optimists such as Garcia but
reaches different conclusions. In par- ticular, this set of scholars
suggests that what may look like a clash between humanitarian principle
and base self-interest actually reflects the influence of competing
foundational and constitutive norms such as sovereignty, self-defense,
and free trade (Legro 1997, 33; Capie 2008; Grilot 2011, 540; Avant
2013, 741). This has resonance with a broader literature discussing the
tensions between market liberal norms and cosmopolitan liberal norms
(Orbie and Khorana 2015). Regulation, therefore, re- flects the outcome
of clashes (or indeed overlaps) between so-called "good" (e.g.,
humanitarian) norms and "bad" (e.g., free trade, sovereignty, military
necessity) norms, or, more precisely, emerges as the outcome of
particular norm hierarchies or systems of norms (Wunderlich 2013, 23). I
will argue that an analysis of policy in the late nine- teenth century
not only provides support for this perspec- tive but also illustrates
the historically contingent nature of permissive and proscriptive arms
trade norms---in this case, norms grafted onto foundational constitutive
norms of anti-slavery, free trade, sovereignty, colonialism, and the
standard of civilization. The third strand of pessimistic literature has
drawn on thicker understandings of critical or postcolonial the- ory to
critique contemporary practices of arms control. Where the optimists
focus on and celebrate the success of discrete campaigning
initiatives---the first Matryoshka doll of arms trade
governance---critical pessimists also aim to contextualize such
initiatives within the broader fields and logics associated with the
inter-related gov- ernance of arms, security, economy, and people. **[In
this context, action on landmines or cluster munitions has been depicted
as part of a "devil's bargain"]{.underline}** (Krause 2011, 23) **[in
which the protection of some people from some weapons is achieved at the
expense of legitimizing other arms, forms of violence, and ways of
war---in particular, liberal militarism]{.underline}** (Stavrianakis
2016). Even more funda- mentally, some critical pessimists, drawing on
Foucault (2003, 2007), have argued that **[initiatives on landmines or
small arms can only be properly understood as part of what has been
labeled as "arms control as governmental- ity"]{.underline}** (Krause
2011; also see Mutimer 2011). It is not my intention here to provide a
full exploration of the con- cept of governmentality or its application
to colonialism (on the latter see Scott 1995; Larner and Walters 2002)
but rather to use it to highlight particular themes relevant both to the
study of arms trade regulation in the late nine- teenth century and
current debates about norms, HAC, and arms trade regulation. The first
theme is reflected in the Sending and Neu- man (2006; also see Neuman
and Sending 2007) who emphasize a reading of governmentality as
concerned with the changing practices and rationality (or mental- ity)
of governing and how these reflect and produce particular relations of
power. For them, adding in a governmentality perspective to the
examination of both "good" and "bad" norms provides for a more com-
plete analysis by situating them in the broader relations of power,
rationalities, and practices that produce cer- tain forms of behavior as
appropriate and certain ac- tors and identities as superior (Neuman and
Sending 2007). For example, rather than viewing the landmines campaign
as illustrative of a civil society realm empow- ered at the expense of
recalcitrant states, they suggest it is better understood as indicative
of a governmental rationality in which political power operates through
NGOs and one in which they are not so much oppo- nents of power as
agents or even products of power (Sending and Neumann 2006; also see
Lipschutz 2005, 247). A second theme concerns the way in which govern-
mentality is understood when applied to the field of international
relations. In some perspectives, governmen- tality requires a concern
with elaborating the techniques aimed at regulating the behavior of
states and govern- ments, particularly in a context of unequal power re-
lations between North and South (Joseph 2009). For example, Mathur
(2016) has critiqued the "colonialist governmentality" of arms control,
evident in the prac- tices of technology denial, forcible disarmament,
and counter-proliferation employed by the West and laun- dered through a
new standard of civilization mantra. Al- ternatively, Krause has placed
more emphasis on Fou- cault's distinction between sovereign and
governmental power. The former is concerned with securing a given
territory through the exercise of direct power, whilst the latter is
exercised through the wide-ranging regulation of economy and society and
particularly associated with lib- eral techniques of government (Krause
2011, 21). Here, the distinction between the two does not imply a
rejection or displacement of sovereignty (Joseph 2009, 415) but its
recasting within the concern for population (Sending and Neumann 2006,
657). Equally, there always remains the possibility that governmental
power can give way to the exercise of more direct forms of sovereign and
disci- plinary power (Joseph 2009, 426). Thirdly, when applied to the
field of arms control, this implies a distinction between a sovereign
concep- tion of arms control and arms control as governmen- tality. The
former is focused not only on securing the states' monopoly of force but
also on reducing the risk of war between states, and its practices are
shaped by formal adherence to notions of sovereign equality (Krause
2011). **[The latter is focused on managing pop- ulations, represents a
technology of social control, and is concerned with "who could
legitimately use what kinds of violence against which people or groups .
. . under what circumstances"]{.underline}** (ibid., 31). Both types of
arms control can be identified in the practices of earlier eras, but
sovereign approaches to arms control were more characteristic of the
Cold War era. In the post-Cold War era, arms control as governmentality
is characterized by initiatives such as the ban on landmines and
postconflict disarmament demobilization programs (ibid.). At one level,
therefore, this paper functions as a work of history that aims to
delineate the norms, logics, and practices that constituted a particular
period of the oper- ation of arms control as governmentality. As already
dis- cussed, however, the analysis of the governmentality of arms trade
regulation in the late nineteenth century also provides a basis for
critiquing the ahistorical and uncrit- ical assumptions of the norm
optimist literature on arms trade regulation.

### One China Link (Taiwan)

#### The "One China" frame of the affirmative relies on the reduction of Taiwan to a commodity for political exchange with china in a western system of globalization -- the reduction of Taiwanese independence to a negotiating point renders the western hegemony of capitalism inevitable -- justifying violence and imperial expansion lead by Chinese and American Capitalists

**Cohen 2006** (Sande Cohen Is a Historian and a Former Instructor of
Critical Studies at the California Institute for the Arts, Focusing on
History and Historiography. \"History Out of Joint: Essays on the Use
and Abuse of History.\" Pages 60-71. JHS Press, 2006. Web. 17 Oct.
2016.)

I have argued that **[Taiwan\'s contentious past is strong enough that
it]{.underline}** con- Ceptually **[leads to a kind Of ahistorical
situation, where this]{.underline}** contention **[could dislodge
Western metanarratives]{.underline}**. This is a case where **[Taiwan is
not historiciz- able without acknowledging the rivalrous politics of
representation and resis- tance, which includes origin notions as well
as senses Of discontinuity]{.underline}**. Now I wish to shift to the
sense of Taiwan in a segment of the American media, here Los Angeles
Times editorials. My purpose in moving to the editor- ial is to show how
these editorials do not lead to a grasp of Taiwan as a com- plicated
place, or dehistoricize it. **[This involves a discursive prose economy
Of restriction, which favors the mainland narrative of Taiwan\'s return,
which for Americans is the easy way out of confronting our own hegemonic
interests]{.underline}**. In short, **[representation for purposes Of
persuasion]{.underline}**, as Old as rhetoric (i.e., poli- tics) itself,
**[has become an Asia-for-American]{.underline}**s, where journalists as
well con- nected as Edgar Snow and scholars as well established as John
Fairbanks have made representations that saturate American readers in
narrativized, prosaic 32 The latter is a persistent prose form. Despite
some outstanding reporting and event analysis on Asia by some Los
Angeles Times writers,\" c**[onstruction of ideas and images of Taiwan
through the more directed editorial page remains a paramount instance Of
misfigura- tion]{.underline}**. **[The editorial mode is]{.underline}**
an everyday prose text that makes **[a mental image or concept Of action
and relationship]{.underline}**. The usual editorial is close to a mode
of persuasion and dissuasion when it brings current theories and
politics to pub- lic discourse, giving prosaic figuration. **[For
example,]{.underline}** there have been, nation- ally, hundreds Of
editorial columns using the phrase \"**[Asian miracle]{.underline}**,\"
**[a phrase that embeds Asian financial and cultural life in Western
notions of economics]{.underline}**, **[threaded to uncontested notions
Of growth and \"take-off,\" conjuring senses Of development, Asia
simplified and corresponding to the type, Asians R Us.]{.underline}**
While an exhibit by a Taipei artist depicting Asian icons with Western
pornog- raphy \"growing onto\" sacred Asian sensibilities requires its
own terms, once described for an American audience as \"bold\" and
\"audacious,\" it acquires the historicizing functions of \"the first
show that did that,\" which feeds various senses that are potential
misfigurations. Further, my reading of the Los Angeles Times editorials
on Taiwan borrows from the conceptual framework of Tzvetan Todorov\'s
The Morals of History (1995), a book that takes great pains to set forth
categories Of figuring forth others in modern Western writing. Let me
discuss Todorov\'s book as a con- ceptual point Of entry to my \"local\"
reading of the Times. In surveying the his- tory of wordedness or
interpretative and ideological relations between Spanish conquerors and
what they did to Indian texts, using commentaries by oppo- nents of the
conquest such as Las Casas or apologists like Sepulveda, Todorov argues
that **[Western assimilation smuggles in the premise of its own
superior- ity; for]{.underline}** instance, **[the rule of law is said
to show our advanced development de- spite the political violence of
Western history]{.underline}**.34 **[The West claims superiority as it
tries to avoid tagging others as inferior. No one wants to admit to
superior- ism]{.underline}**, Todorov continues, **[so we privilege
dialogism]{.underline}**, to \"read myself in quota- tion marks,\" Often
favored when referring to Others.\" **[Our affective
feelings]{.underline}** for others, **[say admiration for \"Asian
loyalty]{.underline}**,\" **[often accompanies nonknowl-
edge,]{.underline}** as in the case of Montaigne\'s regret for the
slaughter Of the Aztecs, **[which was based on a Western failure to live
up to its own ideals]{.underline}**, not on the intrin- sic worth of
Aztec life. Of course emphasis upon a culture or civilization\'s in-
ternal articulation of differences---their make it impossible to
understand them at all. **[In Todorov\'s notion of Western wordedness,
truth and misfiguration are al- ways co-present]{.underline}**. In
addition to risks of superiorism, historical writing presup- poses
truth-disclosure, an intersubjective truth, not a referential one. When
is- sues of fact are unsettled, we expect a \"depth of penetration\" to
provide a collective interpretation that spans group interests, serving
as the basis for fur- ther discussions. **[This kind of truth aims at
\"adherence among readers.\"]{.underline}** Here things get sticky. For
with intersubjective interpretations, we are interested not so much in
adequacy of discourse to referent, but in reaching agreement. Ad-
herence is often at Odds with truth-adequation, with its epistemic
atomism Or regression to the facts, but insistence that some facts
cannot be explained away. How does one get from \"facts\" to an
inclusive discourse that actually absorbs each fact\'s adequacy without
distortion? Of all the facts, including those about processes, available
about Asian economies since 1970, how did the phrase \"Asian miracle\"
arise? Further, depth interpretations, requiring adherence, giv- ing
intersubjective connections, can be coherent in one way, but can render
a larger incoherence in relation to another interpretation. **[A
coherent interpre- tation is bound to be reductive just because it
smoothes and resolves con- tention]{.underline}**. In sum,
**[in]{.underline}** those **[areas]{.underline}** **[ruled by
intersubjectivity---politics, culture, morality, aesthetics, and
language---truth as adequation and truth as disclo- sure opens onto the
consequence that coherence is not very intellectually stim-
ulating]{.underline}**; **[the possible incoherence is
stimulating]{.underline}**. Try as he may, Montaigne\'s denunciation of
Eurocentrism in the name Of equality also gave Eurocentrism a lease on
life once Europeans used the ideal of equality, its irresistible coher-
ence, to oppress Africans, among others, in the nineteenth century.36
Another way Of putting Todorov\'s construal of history and misfiguration
is just to emphasize that representation and resistance can collide in
any public claim to mediate **[representation]{.underline}**. Public
newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times **[can be used to intensify,
slow down, speed up, displace, etc. what \"counts\"]{.underline}** as
news, namely, **[decisions by governing bodies]{.underline}**; in
another register, this means that one is al\'.vays caught up in
privileging certain mediating roles, such as those Of cultural guide, or
political prophet, or existential naysayer, or the wis- dom of the
businessman. This also occurs in Taiwanese life. For example, in July
1998 a conference was held in Taiwan at Tsing-Hua University, with the
title \"Problematizing Asia. \" The conference continued lines of
thought opened by cultural (mainly British) and postcolonial studies. In
the announcement of the conference, via e-mail, the chief organizer said
that a gathering is necessary because of the coming into dominance of
the phrase \"rise of Asia\" (dated from the mid-1980s), specifically the
fact that **[Asia was again an obsession of the West. Calling for an
\"intervention\" so as to \"fill the gap\" in what the various Western
and Asian discursive regimes have neglected]{.underline}**, the
\"Problematizing Asia\" conference asked questions so broad that their
sheer scale dominated as rhetorical form. Citing \"local, national,
regional, international and global lev- els,\" the organizer asked,
\"How do we place \'Taiwan\' in these contexts?\" Here, a progressive
group\'s immediate worry was over Taiwanese nationalism---pro-
aboriginal/proindependence for Taiwan---a worry that seems to have
England at the time of Thatcher\'s ascendancy in mind, where right-wing
nationalism was revived, adding to the difficulties Of establishing a
new critical left. But should response to Thatcherist nationalism serve
as a model for Taiwanese in- tellectual resistance to Taiwanese
nationalism? One Can certainly see what is at stake when it comes to
concepts and im- ages of Asia in the editorial page of the Los Angeles
Times. As said above, there is more writing by the Times on Asia than
the editorials. Apart from headline stories, Jim Mann\'s \"international
outlook\" regularly gave a deep sense of the historical and temporal
issues involved. The business section reports on the fi- nancial
turmoil, from a persistently dreadful perspective of Asia as a place of
lower costs and infinite needs. I am going to restrict my comments to
the ed- itorials written by Tom Plate, who in the period under
discussion wrote all Of the editorials for the Times, whose byline
listed teaching in UCLA\'s commu- nication and policy studies program,
and who heads an Asia Institute at UCLA, an organization of schools and
corporate sponsors that promotes glo- balization in its \"moderate\"
form. The editorials discussed are an active attempt by the Times to
shape public opinion, the editorial itself timed to Asian \"events\" so
as to be more immedi- ate in its impact. Editorial practice often serves
to anticipate the possibilities Of a future event and because Of this
quality, its timing connects immediate and structural forces at once. An
editorial, in short, is one Of the forms in which readers do not grapple
with problems so much as receive interest and motivation, immediate
impressions, even if they are canceled the next day by another
editorial. They are more or less consistent tapes of guidance for the
uninitiated. **[These impressions naturalize the political and
intellectual, giving it the form of the unquestionable]{.underline}**
(the \"real\" right now). **[An editorial aims not so much at
instruction as at guidance]{.underline}**---**[shaping consensus for
tomorrow\'s conflicts, defusing the contentiousness Of Other
perspectives, leading its read- ers to the necessity of what tomorrow is
to look like. It is all about the making of coherence.]{.underline}**
Let us start then with an editorial from August 1997. Plate writes that
the \"Pacific Rim community\" is a real entity, required not just by the
historical moment of a \"Rise of Asia\" nor by trade concerns, but by
the need for a \"brain-trust\" of the \"best universities\" in the
United States, Asia, and Latin America. The president ofUSC is cited,
for whom \"LA. is the Rome of the (Pacific) Rim,\" a community of the
best universities that are \"brand names\" in Asia, where \"a U.S.
degree is worn like a badge of honor. \"38 There is said to be a
\"bond\" between Pacific Rim universities, a \"sunny optimism\"
underlying their \"common challenges\" concerning economic development,
this positive model set against a right wing in California protesting
China\'s rent of docks at Long Beach. There are Asians \"like us\" and
there are Americans stuck in Mc- Carthyism. In a few sentences the prose
frees the West\'s global community from opposition to it. In the same
sentence, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Singa- pore are said to have replaced
New York, Paris, and Rome as world centers, but this is put
hysterically: \"the university group aspires to be this new com-
munity\'s on-call brain cell, \" where \"on-call\" privileges economic
managers, fi- nancial traders, dealers Of all sorts, including those
involved in the circulation Of symbol, sign, image. None Of this talk of
corporate and university \"brain- trusts\" is connected to such past
practices as what happened with U .S. profes- sors advising, say, the
Chilean military and business interests. In August of 1997, the column
\"On Taiwan, Beijing Learns to Yawn\" com- pliments Beijing over an
impending visit from the president of Taiwan, a one- night touchdown on
U.S. soil (Hawaii). Beijing\'s not going berserk is made a sign of its
\"maturity\" and is opposed to the \"latest, potentially trouble
making\" move by Taiwan. The \"maturity\" Of 1997 corrects Beijing\'s
being \'Sultratouchy\" in 1996, when it lobbed missiles close to Taiwan.
Beijing has earned the right to be touchy because
\"**[Beijing]{.underline}**, as well as a lot Of Chinese (and more than
a few people inside Taiwan) **[regard Taiwan as an integral part Of
historic China]{.underline}**.\" Rather than define \"integral\" and
\"historic,\" words with a large range Of PO- tential misfiguration,
**[the article images Taiwan as provoking China, by having a \"perceived
campaign of clever resistance to the process of eventual reunifica-
tion]{.underline}**.\" **[\"Clever\" goes with \"trouble making,\"
giving those Taiwanese the qual- icy \"aggressive, \" while \"maturity\"
and \"touchy\" gives the mainland government the quality Of
\"provoked.\"]{.underline}** This is the coherence of which Todorov
speaks--- **[the Taiwanese are given a totalizing, overly coherent,
interpretation, in the negative]{.underline}**. The next phrase reads:
\"In fact, **[the diplomatic reality is that tiny but economically
over-achieving Taiwan is formally recognized as an independent
government by only 30 countries]{.underline}**, one of which is Panama,
and not by either the U.N. or the U.S. But **[its feisty government and
newfound democratic ways combine to create the effect of an independent
state, which stations an army of loyalists and lobbyists in
America]{.underline}**.\"39 Let us name each of the pejora- tives ladled
over Taiwan, or the use of coherent history to delegitimize.
\"**[Diplomatic reality]{.underline}**\" **[refers to
governmental]{.underline}** and U.N. **[acceptance of mainland Chinese
claims over Taiwan.]{.underline}** This Omits the U.N. decision Of 1952
that affirmed self-determination as a principle for nonstates. \"Tiny\"
reduces and \"over-achieving\" goes with \"tiny\" to form the image Of
an aggressive group, with the insult or curse that Panama, alone Of the
thirty supporting govern- ments mentioned, recognizes Taiwan. **[If
Taiwan is supported by Panama, then Taiwan must be eccentric or worse,

column took up China\'s \"White Paper\" on Taiwan, released just before
the March 2000 elec- tions. Here the party reaffirmed the 1949 One China

the Kuomintang insofar as they trace their genealogy to Sun Yat-sen\'s
reforms and the Republic of China of 1911. Why not discuss 1911? Citing
mainland Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the \"White Paper\" is affirmed as
the \"time-honored Chinese way of saying that Only the full course Of

\"tiny island\" returns, this time not to affirm Tai- wanese
sovereignty, but only as an end to the KMT \"behemoth\": the Taiwan
political transformation is not about independence, only the Taiwan
middle class pushed the DPP into office; the election was really about
\"corruption,\" the voters said to be concerned with globalization (
anticronyism), not pol- itics.47 **[The discourse keeps on track the

toward China: a \"just right\" attitude of balance, which nonetheless is
based on accep- tance of Beijing\'s demand that Taiwan is a

family fold.\" 49 **[Taiwan has been Oedi- palized]{.underline}** (the
time span Of the editorials roughly correlating with the time it takes
to manifest Oedipus in children). Citing yet another well-placed
\"source,\" a \"contact\" at the Rand Corporation, readers are told that
Americans must try to make sure that China is not placed in the vise
where they will in- vade Taiwan \"if they have no choice,\" i.e.,
Taiwan\'s political life must be de- politicized. Hence **[American
foreign policy must \"avoid strategic intimacy\" with
Taiwan,]{.underline}** or Congress must foreswear any \"formal

sovereign. In fact, the American pub- lic must listen to our \"wise\"
and enlightened think-tank corporate \"players\" for whom the \"third
way\" toward China relations (here reduced to hawk/dove,
containment/engagement) is acongagement,\" or \"a little Of this, a
little of that; lean a little left, then to the right,\" this to pursue
the inexorable aims Of glob- alizati0n.50 Thus China\'s \"leftist
purists\" who criticize Premier Zhu Rongji for rushi or \"entry to the
world\" (510balizationP and American conservatives or liberal-unionists

groups.\" **[All this lopsided \"coherence\" has the effect of making
Taiwan disappear. Its history of continuous discontinuity with invaders

KMT\'s fifty-year domination might now dissolve, be made into something
else, is unthinkable, i.e., that the island\'s self-sorting out can be
achieved in its own **[register. Taiwan remains pre-historical, and not
out of choice.]{.underline}** The editorial that calls Clinton and
Zemin\'s meeting \"historic\" also de- clares, \"**[A new order is
descending on Asia.]{.underline}** This is no historical accident.\"
Thus, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji are not \"parochial \";52 one should be
glee- ful over Clinton\'s rejection in Beijing of independence for
Taiwan (communism in China and neoconservative-liberalism in America
locked into No Clauses); then a rhetorical question: whether Taiwan
\"suddenly finds itself On the wrong side of history. With but 21
million people (tiny, again) the offshore island is a democracy that
will never be a superpower or threaten anyone militarily.\"53 The
\"wrong side of history\" is a phrase of pure terror---extreme
disidentifica- tion with Taiwan\'s actual political transformation in
March 2000. Again, **[the linkage to China always makes Taiwan disappear
into historiographic oblivion--- history used to denarrate. I call this
a strong instance of historical narration in the restrictive mode,
disturbing because it gives its readers the satisfactions of eliminating
rival concepts and attending social and political
arrangements.]{.underline}** In fact, these editorials complete the
dehistoricization of Taiwan: \"The United Nations and the United States
refuse to recognize Taiwan as an official nation \... But even if you
find no pathos at all in Taiwan\'s plight \... the man- ner Of
Beijing\'s resolution Of this grating rebuke (March 2000 elections) to

reduction Of conflict, in which \"historic\" and \"historical\" and

by the West---China should avoid violence]{.underline}**. Those pesky
and trouble-making Taiwanese should listen to Clinton, who passes into
the voice of speaking for the Communist Party: \"his administration no
longer wants the Taiwan tail to wag the Sino-U .S. dog. Again:
\"Clinton, like it or not Taiwan, has forsworn U.S. support for formal
Taiwanese independence.\" Perversely, the elections Of 2000 are treated
as if they were nothing but the KMT Of 1949. **[The editorials singled
out here testify to what Roland Barthes called myth,]{.underline}**

unalterable hierarchy Of the world.]{.underline}** \"55 **[They are
prose-myth where the narrative dimension has become a premise:

ideological effects of rigid coherence seem confirmed by the editorials.
**[The complex historicity of Taiwan and its conflicts with others do

terms with conflicted narratives/histories]{.underline}**. In addition,
the editorials belong to prose, myth, and don the mask Of reflexive
speech, **[maxims that \"overlay a world which is already made, bury the
traces of this production under a self-evident appearance \... the
decorous equivalent of a tautology]{.underline}**.\" That is to say, the
ed- itorials discussed above never waver in their commitment to the
rhetoric Of ex- tending some existing facts on the ground, dubious as
history, and as such facts are attached and threaded to the institutions
of this university-based \"PacRim community,\" whose interests are
confused with the public, then it seems fair to ask how such
misfiguration does not convey pure politics, the politics of historical
misrepresentation. The editorials feel aimed at satisfying last readers,
as discussed in chapter I. Taiwan is an island at the edge Of
continental Asia. **[On political and cul- tural grounds---regimes and
resistances, involving the use Of origins and nar- ratives---there is
not any plausible historical argument for One China. One China is a
fiction. It is this fiction that is now nearly impossible to speak to in

as right wing, antiprogressive, and antifuture if one objects to
American politics and multinational capitalism linked to
Chinese]{.underline}** State-**[Capitalism]{.underline}**, among other
things. But one can resist the associations by suspending \"one story\"
and shift- ing in thought to the Taiwanese---the elections Of 2000 as a
watershed in that it shows Taiwan\'s difference in politics and
historiography**[. Imposed on Taiwan is a \"burden Of history\" that
prevents us from knowing Taiwan]{.underline}**---in Todorov\'s
sense---**[hence from knowing about a specific force of]{.underline}**
dissidence, people not- like-us. In this sense, **[Westerners who
venture to learn something of the pre- sent conflicts between the United
States, China, and Taiwan, might borrow an idea from Jean Baudrillard,
that Taiwan is not a matter of finalities---but a \"so- ciety (that) is
totally there at each instant,]{.underline}**\" 56 Which means: an
affirma- tion of the island Taiwan\'s resistance to history**[. It
should be unthinkable to make Taiwan subject to the failures and power
attacks of the Communist Party of China, as America, even if by
omission, yokes Taiwan to the destiny of American-led globalization and
China\'s Other role, its new submission to the West, becoming
\"us.\"]{.underline}**

### Reunification Link (Taiwan)

#### The influence of western neoliberalism on China situates reunification with Taiwan within a temporal history of neoliberalism, not just nationalist tendencies. Neoliberalism is not just a material apparatus but a structure of fear and anxiety that affectively infects the future- their rudimentary analysis of Taiwan neglects the production of alternate futures and times.

**Wang 2017 (**Chih-ming , Academia Sinica - Taiwan, "'The future that
belongs to us': Affective politics, neoliberalism and the Sunflower
Movement," 2017, Sage Publications**[)]{.underline}**

**[The Sunflower Movement's ambivalent view toward the future can
perhaps be summarized as follows: The future will come, but I do not
know in what form (or more likely in a form I do not agree with); what I
know is that if I cannot control the future, I must hold on to the
present. The utopian injunction to become brave, and to become owners
not losers, is the affective response to this formulation of the future
as inevitable, precarious, overwhelming, and which therefore must be
resisted now by imagining a new collectivity to withstand the wheel of
time. It is as if the future is certain, inalterable, and arriving, and
all we can do is to prevent it from coming for as long as we can. Such a
future of/as neoliberalism is imagined to be an external force coming to
devour us, or, to use another metaphor, to 'assimilate' us, making our
time synchronous with neoliberalism's time]{.underline}**. The
discussion of neoliberalism tends to focus on geography. Harvey's
(2005b) thesis of 'uneven geographical development' explains how
capitalist growth depends on the 'spatial fix' to overcome capital's
internal contradictions and maximize accumulation. However, **[time is
also an important factor, especially with regard to high finance that
capitalizes on cycles of boom and bust, and even takes time as a
commodity form]{.underline}**. But critics of neoliberalism, if
interested in time, tend to read neoliberalism's time in the light of
apocalypse and anti-future, especially in the context of climate change,
arguing that the scramble for resources and **[the hope of endless
economic growth are not only incompatible with each other and
unsustainable but will also bring about empire and the end of
politics]{.underline}** (Klein, 2014; Loo, 2011; Robinson, **[2004).
Interpreting neoliberalism's time in the geographical context,
anthropologist Hai Ren argues that the neoliberalization of the Chinese
state is contingent on the restoration of Hong Kong's sovereignty in
1997 as the means of remaking socialist China to become 'synchronic with
the contemporary capitalist world']{.underline}** (2010: x). Translating
the Chinese phrase yu shijie jiegui in the 1990s as 'synchronization,'
**[Ren conveys an understanding of Chinese neoliberalization as a
nationalist and global project that not only seeks to develop the
economy but also to re-unify and reintegrate 'long lost territories,'
such as Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[while
neoliberal synchronization means for China the attempt to be equal with
the West in sharing the same temporality, it also sheds light on an
important dimension of neoliberal globalization as penetrating and
breaking down the barriers of time, to induct -- if not abduct -- others
into the homogeneity of the now.]{.underline}** In short,
**[neoliberalism's time is not just anti-future and apocalyptic, but the
collapse of the future into the present]{.underline}**. The
**[neoliberalist telos is of course prosperity by turning to the common
as well as the individual as the site for capitalist
development]{.underline}**; in this very sense, **[the future of
neoliberalism is singular, certain, and inalterable, and only the
present is up for grabs]{.underline}**. **[The future informs, even
dictates, the present; it tells us what to do and shows us where we will
be. Worse yet, the homogeneous imagination of the future only produces
greater anxiety about the present because the future is no longer
waiting to happen, but right here in our faces. The only choice we are
given is to accept its challenge by making the right moves to compete
and accumulate, or else fall under its ruthless wheels. The certainty of
the future hence becomes a means to discipline the
presen]{.underline}**t, turning the heterogeneous now into homogeneous
empty time leading to the neoliberal future. If the nation-state relies
on the homogeneous empty time, as Benjamin suggested, to write its
history as a story of progress and arrival, **[neoliberalism is remaking
the progress-oriented future into a prison house of subjectivity and
dream by making uniform the heterogeneous now and excluding the
alternatives it holds. Neoliberalism's future is a form of biopolitics
that dictates our paths to the future and a necropolitics of
imagination.]{.underline}** In this sense, **[the Sunflower Movement's
vision of the future can be read as a resistance to neoliberalism's
future]{.underline}** -- regretfully but appropriately embodied by the
Chinese state and capital. At the same time, **[its lack of future
imagination, except that of an anticommunist, independent nation-state
to come, reinforces the hold of neoliberalism in folding the future into
the present and in collapsing biopolitics in electoral
democracy.]{.underline}** Despite the more critical but minor formations
within it, it is perhaps not inaccurate to characterize the Sunflower
Movement as more anti-Chinese than anti-neoliberal. **[What they are
really worried about is not so much the Chinese state as the singularity
and certainty of the neoliberal future that China embodies as a
political and economic entity. Neoliberalism works in the minds of the
Sunflower generation as a powerful combination of neoliberal economy and
Chinese political hegemony, against which an independent and democratic
nation-state has become their last hope of escape, as they are thrown
into the maelstrom of neoliberal competition]{.underline}**

### Small Arms Link

#### The 1AC's demonization of small arms sales uses a neoliberal tactic of ignoring conventional weapons and paradoxically decreases global restraint

Small Arms and Light Weapons **[A similar]{.underline}**, although less
powerful and less complete **[process, has]{.underline}** also
**[occurred with respect to small arms]{.underline}**. Even as late as
1990 Carr could note, "the standard response when arms transfer analysts
discuss the trade in small arms is to dismiss the notion of control as
both unworthy of their time and unworkable" (Carr 1990, 24). In the
post--Cold War era, however, small arms have been successfully reframed
as problem weapons that require detailed scrutiny by analysts and
policymakers. **[Consequently, they are now discussed as "weapons of
individual destruction"]{.underline}** (Stohl et al. 2007, 11), **[a
threat to "millions of human lives,"]{.underline}** and a category of
arms that have "a significant impact on human security" (Stohl and
Grillot 2009). This is not to underestimate the terrible impact small
arms can have on conflicts. However, rather like the issue of landmines,
**[this is a form of military technology that has become particularly
problematized in the post--Cold War era]{.underline}**. Indeed, as
Goldring has noted, it is now "con- ventional wisdom . . . that light
weapons are the dominant and generally the sole weapons used in current
conflicts" (Goldring 2006, 89). Thus, for the UN forty-seven out of
forty-nine conflicts in the 1990s "were waged with small arms as the
weapon of choice" (ibid.). This particular post-- Cold War framing of
small arms and light weapons is neatly reflected in the observation by
the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Commit- tee that "not all
conventional weapons are equally lethal, with small arms and light
weapons being particularly deadly" (House of Commons For- eign Affairs
Committee 2009, 119 para. 299)---an observation unlikely to be made by
NATO commanders at the height of the Cold War. **[Moreover, Goldring's
research on civil conflicts that took place in 2004 suggests that the
dominance of light weapons in civil conflict has been overstated--- with
both light weapons and major conventional weapons being used in
twenty-two out of twenty-six conflicts]{.underline}** (Goldring 2006,
90). **[If small arms were ignored in the Cold War, they have now been
demonized to the point where the role of conventional weapons in civil
conflicts has become almost invisible.]{.underline}** None of this is to
deny the important role played by ethical framings and a concern with
threats to the human in the construction of arms trade regulation and
pariah weapons regulation generally. The point is, how- ever, that
**[the role of such ethical discourses is both more ambiguous and more
complex than conventional narratives about the mine ban movement or the
cluster munitions treaty usually allow]{.underline}**. Moreover, as
illustrated most clearly in the case of the 1890 Brussels Act, the
presence of pariah weapons regulation is not necessarily a sign of a
more general shift to the tighter regulation of the arms trade.
Consequently, **[any consideration of the effects of pariah regulation
on global and local peacebuilding]{.underline}** also has to take into
account the broader system of arms regulation in which it is located and
the relationship that exists between pariah regulation and this broader
system. The next two sections will offer some observations on these
issues. The Post--Cold War Arms Trade Paradox The approach adopted to
the regulation of the arms trade in general does not simply reflect
concerns about particular kinds of technology and their impact on power
and interest, but also broader attitudes to political economy. For
example, the dominance of mercantilism and the emphasis on autarky in
the sixteenth century encouraged a more active approach to the
regulation of arms transfers. Previously, exports had largely been
restricted in order to guarantee domestic supply of scarce military
mate- rial, a case in point being the writ issued by Henry V in 1414
prohibit- ing the export of gunpowder as part of his preparations for
Agincourt (Barker 2005, 91). By the sixteenth century however, surplus
production was also restricted. One example of this was the prohibition
on the export of English guns imposed by Elizabeth I in 1574 owing to
concern that such exports ensured "yor enemie is better fourneshed with
them than our country ships ar" (Krause 1992, 41). Conversely,
Elizabethan-era regula- tions notably extended earlier attempts to
preserve English proficiency with the longbow by imposing a requirement
on merchants to "import ten bowstaves for every tun of wine" (Strickland
and Hardy 2011, 405). In contrast, the shift in economic ideology from
mercantilism to capi- talism led to the more laissez-faire approach to
the regulation of arms transfers in the late nineteenth century already
noted above. For example, France passed legislation in 1885
reinstituting the private manufacture of arms and also repealed the law
prohibiting exports (Kolodziej 1987, 15; Stohl and Grillot 2009, 14). Of
course, belief in the beneficial effects of free trade nevertheless
mingled with considerations of power, interest, and ethics to produce
different coalitions of actors arguing for proscription or permission of
the arms trade. However, these different positions were themselves
rooted in common assumptions about the pacifying effects of trade and
development. In one version of this, many nineteenth-cen- tury peace
activists argued that while liberal economies would ultimately bring
peace through trade and growth, it was necessary to help this pro- cess
along by lifting the burdens of military spending and avoiding the
interruptions to trade likely to occur from conflict among the major
pow- ers (Cortright 2008). In another version, the nineteenth-century
equivalent of the security- development nexus now so beloved of
post--Cold War analysts of peace- building was deployed to argue in
favor of the arms trade. In the context of the 1890 Brussels Act this
was reflected in British arguments on the need for a provision
permitting the transit of arms across the colonial ter- ritory of
another state so that it could supply British settlers in the inte-
rior. Failure to adopt this provision, it was argued, would involve "the
abandonment of . . . trading and missionary stations, germs of civilisa-
tion, to the mercy of surrounding savage tribes" (Lord Vivian, January
30, 1890). Similarly, for the Marquis of Salisbury, such a provision was
neces- sary to advance "the strengthening of the civilizing element in
Africa, the encouragement of its establishment in the interior and the
consolida- tion of its power in contending with the brutalizing forces
of the savage races" (Marquis of Salisbury to Lord Vivian, April 23,
1890). Although the language deployed was rather different, the
rationale for both proscrip- tion and restriction of arms supplies in
the era was, therefore, much the same as that deployed today in places
like Afghanistan or Iraq: security for Western agents of civilization
and their local allies needed to be guar- anteed so that the benevolent
effects of trade and development could work their pacifying magic on
local populations. Economic philosophy also shaped the discourse on the
regulation of the arms trade in the aftermath of World War I. In
particular, much of the criticism of the role played by arms merchants
in the run-up to World War I focused on the way private arms traders had
not only facilitated the build-up of weapons but had also encouraged it
through the promotion of war. Instead, critics argued that
nationalization of the arms industry would better ensure that weapons
sales would serve the national interest. Indeed, from the perspective of
the post--Cold War era, such critics evinced a touching faith in the
idea that "a socialized arms industry was by defi- nition a tribune of
peace" (Kolodjie 1987, 28). However, the crisis of faith in private arms
manufacturers came to a head in the 1930s as economic collapse prompted
more general doubts about the viability of the capital- ist system
(Harkavy 1975, 36). One outcome was the creation of the Nye Committee in
the United States and the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of
and Trading in Arms in Britain, both of which examined the issue of
greater state ownership of defense companies. The commit- tees differed
in their conclusions---the latter argued against it, the for- mer in
favor---but both symbolized a growing recognition of the need for
government regulation and oversight of the industry. Although nation-
alization was avoided in most states, the 1930s did see the widespread
adoption of national arms export licensing systems of the kind that
would be recognizable today (Harkavy 1975, 222). In the Cold War, a
combination of national security considerations and the dominance of
Keynesian approaches meant that domestic weap- ons procurement policies
were characterized by a philosophy of welfare militarism in which the
concern was not only to maintain security of supply but also to preserve
jobs, stimulate economies, and preserve key technology sectors.
Consequently, the defense sector was dominated by national champions
(which in Europe were also increasingly transformed into state-owned
companies) who were often awarded contracts without even any
competition. On the one hand, the combination of welfare mili- tarism
and Cold War security concerns encouraged the further extension of
government oversight of arms sales and also government's role in their
promotion. At the same time, however, the overwhelming dominance of Cold
War security logic meant that overseas arms sales were, at least until
the late sixties, viewed more as instruments of geopolitical strategy
than as commercial deals pursued purely for profit, as had been the
case, for example, in the late nineteenth century. **[The end of the
Cold War coincided with (and reinforced) underly- ing shifts in
conceptions of economy and security that influenced the debate on the
arms industry and on arms transfer control. In terms of economy, the
neoliberal agenda]{.underline}** (understood here as an approach to
political economy that emphasizes trade and financial liberalization,
privati- zation, deregulation, and reductions of public sector
employment and expenditures (see Smith and Verdeja, Introduction, this
volume)) **[had already been thoroughly mainstreamed in the policy
discourse of gov- ernments]{.underline}**. Consequently, economic
ideology reinforced other factors that, between them, have now led to a
defense industry characterized less by state-owned companies and/or
national champions and more by private multinational corporations with
far more permeable national identities. For example, BAE Systems, though
nominally a British company, gener- ated \$17.3 billion in US sales in
2008 and \$10.5 billion in other countries compared with \$6.25 billion
in Britain. The company's US sales made it the fourth largest contractor
with the US Department of Defense, while its recent acquisition of an
Australian company has also made it the larg- est arms producer in
Australia (SIPRI 2010, 253). In this respect, today's multinational
companies, with their subsidiaries in a wide range of coun- tries and
their coproduction deals with an even wider range of companies, more
closely resemble the international networks established by the large
defense companies, such as Vickers, in the early 1900s. In terms of the
approach to major arms transfers, the embrace of neo- liberalism
significantly reinforced the shift to a more commercial attitude that
had been gradually evolving from the late 1960s onward. Indeed, as early
as 1990 one commentator could wryly observe that decisions on arms sales
had "passed from balance of power to balance of trade consider- ations"
(Carr 1990, 24), and since then the role of economic considerations in
arms transfer decisions has magnified. This trend has now become so
pronounced that it has led some commentators to suggest that a defining
feature of the post--Cold War arms trade system has been the erosion of
supply-side controls on the export of major weapons (Spear,
forthcoming). This is not to deny that the post--Cold War era has also
witnessed the proliferation of formal international agreements designed
to regulate the arms trade (e.g., the EU Code, the Wassenaar
Arrangement, the UN Program of Action on Small Arms, the UN Arms
Register, etc). **[However, these developments merely highlight an
(apparent) post--Cold War arms trade paradox: that the growth in formal
international regulation has coincided with a relative decline in
certain kinds of restraint, particularly with regard to the willingness
of states to impose qualitative restrictions on the sale of highly
advanced equipment (an issue explored in more detail
later).]{.underline}** The growth in formal international regulation has
also coincided with active efforts to reduce the regulatory restraints
governing arms sales. For example, in 2000 the Clinton administration
launched seventeen propos- als under the Defense Trade Security
Initiative aimed at streamlining the export licensing process (Stohl and
Grillot 2009, 57); in 2007 the George W. Bush administration signed
defense trade cooperation treaties (finally ratified by the US Senate in
2010) with Australia and Britain that permit license-free defense
exports to approved end users in each state. More recently, the Obama
administration has also committed itself to overhaul- ing the US export
control system to make it easier to export weapons to US allies and to
emerging markets such as China (Defense News 2009). There are a number
of initiatives associated with this reform, including a new license
exception for the export of dual-use goods to NATO countries and other
countries selected on the basis of their membership of multinational
nonproliferation regimes. According to the administration, the effect of
this reform will be to eliminate the need for export licenses in nearly
three thousand types of transactions per year, affecting an estimated
\$1.4 bil- lion in annual exports (Bureau of Industry and Security,
2011). Similar processes have been at work in other countries. For
example, in 2002 Brit- ain announced changes to its method of assessing
license applications for components incorporated into military equipment
for onward export, a reform generally interpreted as opening "a
significant export licensing loophole" (Saferworld 2003, 9), while in
2007 France announced it would ease restrictions on products moving
within the EU (Stohl and Grillot 2009, 69). In addition, in 2009 the EU
adopted a directive on intracommu- nity transfers that aims to simplify
export procedures for sales to member states by creating a system of
either general or global licenses. The for- mer, for example, permits
transfers to certified recipients in member states without the need for
an individual license for every transaction (Taylor 2011, 17--18). Many
states already operate similar systems, so it is not clear what the
exact impact of this reform will be, but the reforms are indicative of a
broader trend toward relaxing licensing requirements for all but the
most egregious of states. Today then, **[sales of both major weapons
systems and a range of dual- use items are primarily discussed (by
exporters at least, if not by recipients and their neighbors) in the
language of the technocrat and the banker--- the language of jobs,
financing terms, market share, and performance evaluation. In part this
is a function of the shift to the neoliberal economic framework noted
above]{.underline}**. In part it is also a function of the shift to a
human security-centered approach to conventional arms transfer
regulation that has focused on pariah weapons deemed to have inhumane
impacts, such as landmines and small arms. Indeed, both government and
NGO con- cerns about the negative effects of the arms trade have
bifurcated---with concern focused either on the problem of "weapons of
mass destruction" (problematized primarily in terms of their potential
acquisition by rogue state or nonstate actors) or, at the other end of
the scale, on issues such as small arms (primarily problematized in
terms of the illicit rather than the legal trade in such weapons).

### Sustainability link

#### Sustainability and the capitalist process are diametrically opposed; the health of the environment is a class issue that can only be resolved through revolution

February 18, 2018 --- Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal
--- Karl Marx's concept of sustainability is connected to his concepts
of metabolism and reproduction. While the first connection is well
recognized in recent literature (famously in the work of Paul Burkett,
John Bellamy Foster and many others)\[2\], the second connection is not.
Moreover, sustainability is potentially connected to another crucial
concept in Marx's thinking -- that is, value of labour power (which is
expressed as the wage that workers receive), although Marx fails to
explicitly make that connection. In this short paper, I connect
sustainability to metabolism, reproduction, and value of labour power. I
argue that sustainability (or a healthy environment) can be seen as an
"ecological social wage" under capitalism and has to be fought for as a
part of a larger fight against the various logics of capitalism, such as
endless accumulation, and against the system as a whole. Therefore,
**[ecological sustainability is fundamentally a class issue, one that
concerns the working class of the world as a whole that is comprised of
people with different gender, racial, and nationality backgrounds, and
it is not to be narrowly seen as an ecological issue, separate from the
needs and the movements of the working class.]{.underline}** What is
sustainability? **[To live and to satisfy our needs, we must enter into
a metabolic relation with nature, as Marx says in chapter 7 of Capital
Vol]{.underline}** 1.\[3\] That is, on the basis of manual and mental
labour**[, we must interact with nature from which we get raw materials
and energy and in which we dump waste products. Nature, especially
transformed nature, is a part of the means of production]{.underline}**.
Seeing society as a temporal process, in Chapter 23 of Capital Vol 1
Marx referred to "simple reproduction" saying: "every social process of
production is at the same time a process of reproduction", and "No
society can go on producing, in other words, no society can reproduce,
unless it constantly reconverts a part of its products into means of
production..."\[4\] **[Rubbing Marx's concept of metabolism with his
concept of reproduction, one can say this: in producing the things that
we need, we use up the means of production, including those that come,
more or less, directly from nature, and these means of production must
be replenished in terms of their quantity and quality. For example, if
we cut trees and pollute air to produce wealth, a part of the produced
wealth \-- the combined product of labour and nature \-- has to be
utilized to replenish the trees and to clean the air. We have to
reproduce elements of nature, constantly. Not doing so constitutes a
threat to sustainability.]{.underline}** Marx talks about sustainability
more directly in Capital Vol 3**[: an entire society, a nation, or all
simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not the owners of
the earth. They are simply its possessors, its beneficiaries, and, have
to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations
as]{.underline}** boni patres **[familias \[good
householders\]]{.underline}**'.\[5\] We may conclude that not to do so
is to live in an ecologically unsustainable world, a world where the
physical environment is not in a state of good health. Marx's concept of
sustainability is quite consistent with that of the United Nations'
Brundtland Commission, established in the 1980s to promote sustainable
development globally, which views sustainable development as:
"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland
Commission, 1987).\[6\] **[That capitalism has not achieved
sustainability is clear from the fact that we are facing massive
ecological problems, including global warming, deforestation, soil
erosion, air pollution, resource depletion, etc]{.underline}**. The
question is why? Causes of threat to sustainability First, what is not
the cause? **[The threat to sustainability under
capitalism]{.underline}** does not come from the fact that there are too
many people on earth, nor from the fact that some erstwhile poor
countries are consuming more things to live a slightly better life, nor
indeed from human beings' productive activity as such (e.g.
industrialization), although all these facts do involve increased
extraction of resources from nature. It **[is rather the social form in
which we live our lives and the attendant nature-dominating discursive
framework that constitute the most important threat to
sustainability.]{.underline}** The social form in which we live is not
one that is just.\[7\] We live in an unjust world. So one may ask: what
connection might injustice have to the threat to sustainability? I see
inequality as a form of injustice. And I see inequality not just as
inequality in income and consumption but as class inequality. Class
inequality refers to the **[inequality in the control over society's
productive resources, including those that come directly from nature
(farm land, water, minerals, etc.), and consequent class
exploitation]{.underline}** (appropriation of surplus product or surplus
labour, by the class that controls the means of production from the
class that does not).\[8\] We are talking here about inequality between
those who control productive resources and their uses, and those who do
not, and inequality between those who have the power to exploit others
in production and outside production, and those who do not. Lenin said:
"As long as there is exploitation there cannot be equality."\[9\] More
specifically, the capitalist or "the landowner cannot be the equal of
the worker, or the hungry man the equal of the full man" (ibid.).
Because of class inequality, what we receive from society (in terms of
goods and services to meet our needs) is not quite in accordance with
our abilities; nor is it according to the amount of work we perform
(consider how much a bank CEO makes as opposed to an ordinary worker);
nor indeed is it according to how much we need in order to satisfy all
of our varying needs. **[Class-based inequality as class-based injustice
is the fundamental threat to sustainability]{.underline}**. This
requires an explanation. Most of us have to rely on wage-work to survive
because of our separation from the objective conditions of production,
including nature (land, etc.). Marx called this primitive accumulation,
and this is an on-going process. This separation, with respect to
nature, is not a physical separation, for production in all forms of
society requires unity -- non-separation -- of human beings with nature.
The separation in question is social-political; it is in terms of class.
That is: we have no control over the use of the objective conditions of
production, including those that more or less directly come from nature,
with which we are physically in contact in the realm of production. We
do not decide how much resources are being extracted, in what manner and
at what rate. **[We are a part of nature. We are in physical contact
with nature. Yet, under capitalism, we hardly control the basis on which
we interact with nature. We live in a society which, as Marx says in
Capital Vol 1, is based on endless accumulation of wealth in the form of
money]{.underline}**, as denoted by M-C-MΔ. This is a process whose aim
is not to directly satisfy human needs but to make profit, on a
continuous basis. And this process of endless accumulation, i.e.
accumulation for the sake of accumulation, generally promotes
consumption for the sake of consumption. Otherwise, how will the endless
production of things find a market? And while the accumulation process
tends to be endless, many of the natural resources used in production
are finite. This means, among other things that there is a disjunction
-- a contradiction -- between capital's time (turnover time) and
nature's time. Endless accumulation can take two forms: it is based on
increases in the output over a prolonged working-day (especially in a
context where technological change has not quite occurred) or per hour
(when productivity-enhancing technological change has occurred).\[10\]
And **[this means intense extraction of resources from nature and
expansion of wastes dumped in the natural environment]{.underline}**.
Let us explore this disjunction, this contradiction. **[A capitalist is
compelled to engage in endless accumulation by the logic of
accumulation]{.underline}** and is passionate about this (both logic and
passion matter here), so he/she has to, and wants to, invest money today
and get back the investment with a profit as soon as possible. However,
**[nature's time, which is driven by nature's own bio-physical-chemical
processes that are more or less autonomous of human activities, may not
coincide with capital's time. If a seed is planted today, it may take
months or years for it to become a mature tree to satisfy human
needs]{.underline}**. Impatient to make money endlessly and quickly,
**[the capitalist system cannot give nature enough time to reproduce --
replenish -- itself.]{.underline}** The capitalist class relation seeks
to convert nature into a form of capital. Letting a seed grow into a
mature tree is a natural process that takes time. This is nature's time,
which is, of course, different for different natural processes. But time
-- from capital's standpoint -- is money, and this means that one has
to, for example, pay interest on the capital sunk in the form of the
tree that is slowly growing out of a seed. The longer the time the tree
remains in its natural state, the more is the cost of capital
(interest), potentially. **[Anything that is not a part of circulation
of capital, of the M-C-M Δ process, of the money-making process, is
literally a waste, an unproductive thing. We live in a society where
nature is bought and sold like other things]{.underline}**. Once I buy a
piece of forestland, I can do whatever I want to do with it. The
fetishism of the commodity -- the idea that things that we use
inherently have a price-tag (that is, that they must be bought and sold,
and for a profit, for them to satisfy our needs) -- is most stark in the
case of nature (as it is in case of labour power as a commodity):\[11\]
a beach, a forest or a farmland as things appear to be ones which are
inherently, by necessity, commodities, and increasingly so since the
1970s when the epoch of the post-war crisis in the advanced capitalist
world began. To treat nature and its elements (land, oceans, forests),
as commodities is a hallmark of the modern society we live in. **[This
logic of commodification under capitalism counters the logic of
sustainability]{.underline}**. We live in a society where there is a
profound disjunction, a contradiction, between the global scale of
capitalist accumulation, as it is governed by the globally-operating law
of value or the law of competition, on the one hand, and the political
framework, that is, the state-system on the other, which is
nationally-based (in spite of the erosion of some of the powers of the
state in certain contexts). This disjunction makes it difficult for
humanity to coordinate and to plan the use of natural resources which
occur geographically unevenly on the surface of the earth across
countries in an effective manner. This forces, for example, Japan as a
territorially separate entity with no oil of its own, located on the
earthquake-prone ring of fire, to invest in nuclear energy plants; the
ecologically risky nature of nuclear plants is made riskier by their
location in the ring of fire. Because of the same disjunction, or
contradiction, the low-income countries, more or less deprived of
technologies that the advanced countries enjoy, are having to subject
the natural environment under their territorial jurisdictions to
excessively high level of exploitation, in order to meet their very
basic needs. **[The ability to sustainably reproduce nature is unequally
distributed in a world which is subjected to a global logic of
accumulation and which is divided by nation-states, some of which are
richer and more powerful than others.]{.underline}** We live in a
society where old value must be destroyed for new value to be produced,
and this means war. In many cases, indeed, **[economies of advanced
capitalist countries rely on the production of military weapons to keep
their accumulation system going, and this often means artificially
creating conditions for war, and often this war involves war between
poor countries.]{.underline}** Further, advanced capitalist countries
compete with one another for monopolistic control over the politically
and militarily weaker countries' markets and workforce as well as their
natural resources.\[12\] In short, **[we live in an imperialist world,
and imperialism means war. And war means massive destruction of nature.
It means pollution.]{.underline}** That Agent Orange, a powerful
chemical used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War to eliminate
forest cover for anti-imperialism fighters in North Vietnam, is widely
known. As a more recent example, the western-capitalist war on Iraq
created a massive amount of environmental pollution, producing birth
defects and other health problems, as London's Guardian reported.\[13\]
War also means that resources are invested in killing people, while
these resources can be used to replenish elements of nature (clean up
rivers, oceans, plant trees), to increase the role of public
transportation to reduce environmental pollution, and to enhance
people's access to the things they need such as healthcare, housing,
food, etc.\[14\] **[Using resources on wars or on the preparation for
wars, when resources can be used to meet basic needs of people and to
create a sustainable ecological environment -- this problem is most
glaring in the global periphery. We live in a society where, given the
high rate of labour exploitation and a large reserve army of labour
globally, millions of people are deprived of a decent income with which
to afford things produced in environmentally friendly
ways]{.underline}** (e.g. organically produced food), which are
initially expensive in part because of the small-scale nature of
production. In parenthesis, and in a slight criticism of Marx and
Vladimir I Lenin, I will say that mere separation of direct producers
from land, either in primitive accumulation (as per Marx), or in a
process of class differentiation under the impact of market (as per
Lenin), may create a market for food but not necessarily a market for
ecologically produced food. We live in a society, where there is a
long-term trend towards the decline in the rate of profit as investment
in constant capital to variable capital increases (because labour, as
the ultimate creator of capitalist wealth, is increasingly replaced by
non-labour inputs in the production process). This is also a society
where there is the problem of a constant possibility of overaccumulation
of capital and commodities. This problem is partly caused by lack of
planning of production and by competitively-driven technological
dynamism resulting in production of more and more things every hour,
which, of course, requires more intense extraction of resources from
nature and greater generation of wastes.\[15\] Responding to the
declining rate of profit and the problem of overaccumulation, there is a
tendency to not only increase exploitation of labour but also to make
profit from new forms of commodification and from the destruction of
nature.\[16\] Sustainable production can be a source of profit for some
capitals (consider the production of cleaner technologies; wilderness as
an ecotourist place), so there can be, within limits, sustainable
development within capitalism. But there are strong limits to
sustainability within capitalism, in terms of both the magnitude of
sustainability and the temporal and spatial scale of sustainability (how
long and over how large an area sustainability can occur). This is
because of the social framework within which sustainable development is
promoted. This is the framework of markets-in-every-thing, of endless
accumulation, and of inequality and of exploitation of people**[.
Capitalism takes far too much out of labour compared to what it gives
it, just as it takes far too much out of nature compared to what it puts
into it. There are two metabolic rifts here, joined together in the same
process of capitalist accumulation: an ecological metabolic rift and a
labour metabolic rift.\[]{.underline}**17\] **[Sustainable development
means a clean environment, an environment that is a source of
mental/spiritual peace, a source of material things that satisfy our
needs, and a place to dump what is absolutely a waste product.
It]{.underline}** means a society where farm production and non-farm
production are sectorally and geographically integrated, to the extent
materially possible, thus minimizing metabolic rift between where things
directly derived from nature (e.g. food, linen) are produced (say, in
villages) and where they are consumed.\[18\] Our needs as human beings
include environmental needs. Like other needs, environmental needs
cannot be fully met under capitalism or can be met only in an alienating
way that impoverishes nature and us. A large part of what is called
nature is land. Land is an important means of production, and a source
of food, and it has been subjected to unsustainable use under
capitalism. About the relation between capitalism and agriculture,
**[Marx says that: "the capitalist system runs counter to a rational
agriculture" and that "a rational agriculture is incompatible with the
capitalist system]{.underline}** (even if the latter promotes technical
development in agriculture)".\[19\] Paraphrasing and slightly extending
Marx, Lenin says in his Development of Capitalism in Russia: "That
capitalism is incompatible with the rational organization of agriculture
(as also of industry) has long been known".\[20\] **[One can generalize
Marx's and Lenin's point and say that capitalism is incompatible with
the rational organization of our metabolic interaction with nature.
Capitalism violates the principle of humanization of nature and
naturalization of human beings]{.underline}**. Let me quote someone who
is not a Marxist, Amartya Sen, a Nobel laureate in Economics: "The big
challenges that capitalism now faces in the contemporary world includes
issues of inequality (especially that of grinding poverty in a world of
unprecedented prosperity) and of 'public goods' (that is, goods that
people share together, such as the environment). The solution to these
problems will almost certainly call for institutions that take us beyond
the capitalist market economy." (Sen, 1999:267)\[21\]. **[So what is to
be done? Capitalism can be seen in terms of its logic, or logics, and as
a system\[22\], that is, the totality of capitalist class relation as
such. So the fight against capitalism has to be seen as a fight against
both aspects of capitalism. In terms of the fight against the logics of
capitalism (endless accumulation, commodification, etc.), sustainable
environment must be seen as a human need.]{.underline}** More
specifically, and under capitalism, it must be seen as a part of the
value of labour power itself (something Marx failed to do explicitly).
So sustainable development must be fought for as a part of the fight to
improve living conditions. The fight for environmental needs must be a
part of the fight for a better "social wage". We can call it an
"ecological social wage" and we can extend the scope of the concept of
ecological social wage to include the remunerative price not only for
peasants' labour performed on their own or leased-in land\[23\] but also
for the indigenous communities working on commonly (or state-owned)
owned farm-land and forest areas. Given that one reason for the
unsustainable environment is privatization of nature, the fight for
sustainability must be a fight for common property in nature: for our
rivers, forests, clean air and land as forms of common property. The
fight for a sustainable environment must be a part of the fight for
'nature-commons', and such a fight must be a part of the fight for
treating all forms of use-values (natural and non-natural things
including factories and banks) as commons, which will be subjected to
democratic control by men and women and citizens of different racial,
ethic and nationality backgrounds. **[Fighting for a sustainable
environment is therefore a class issue, in the broadest sense of the
term]{.underline}**. It is a working class issue, or, more correctly, an
issue of the alliance of workers and peasants (or the alliance of
workers and small-scale producers, including indigenous producers). The
matter of sustainable development is a deeply class matter (even if it
is not exclusively a class matter). However, the fight against the
logics of the system to obtain improvements within the system of
capitalism is limited because there are limits to what capital can grant
as long as capital rules. To conclude: **[fighting for sustainable
environment must be a part of the fight against the capitalist system
itself, which exploits people and which is ecologically degrading (and
which promotes and/or reproduces undemocratic relations based in gender,
race, ethnicity and nationality, in order to be able to super-exploit
some sections and to weaken ordinary people's resistance against
exploitation and ecological degradation by dividing them). The fight for
sustainable development must be a fight for a society beyond
commodification, private ownership of means of production, avoidable
inequalities, exploitation, and social oppression.]{.underline}**
**[Such a fight requires a revolutionary program, including the
nationalization of all the major corporations, banks, large farms and
privately owned forests and plantations, under the democratic control of
working people with their different gender, racial, ethnic and
nationality backgrounds. This would allow the rational reorganization of
the world's economy and our relation to nature, to meet the
environmental and social needs of the masses, not the capitalists' need
for endless private profit.]{.underline}**

### Terror link

#### Capital is terror

**Daly 2010 (**Glyn, Associate Professor at university of north Hampton,
"Causes for Concern: Žižek's Politics of Loving Terror", Published in
international journal for Zizek studies vol 4 num 2**)**

Are social miracles possible in today's world? Can they even be
imagined? If so, **[what would such miracles consist of and how might we
connect with them in terms of developing a positive transfigurative
politics]{.underline}**? In Defense represents an exploration of these
questions. It takes up **[the]{.underline}** **[challenge of the
'struggling theories' of Marxism and psychoanalysis and confronts two
central taboos of the modern age: economy and terror]{.underline}**.
(Zizek 2008, 3) Žižek's point is that **[the capitalist economy (like
all economies) rely upon implicit and disavowed forms of
terro]{.underline}**r; **[terror that is systematized, gentrified and
even embraced as a way of identifying with, and of finding a place
within, its horizon of possibilit]{.underline}**y. Lenin had already
observed that **[capital was fully capable of breaking with, and
actually does break with, any historical fidelity it might have shared
with particular states]{.underline}** (Lenin, 1975: 76-77). **[Capital
transcends all political formations and re-colonizes the colonizers as
part of its global empire]{.underline}**. Moreover, with the continuing
rise of authoritarian Chinese capitalism (an Asiatic mode of capitalist
production?) **[we can see how the standard view of a universal and
triumphant amalgamation of liberal-democratic-capitalism is dissolving
before our eyes]{.underline}**. (a Z reference desirable, perhaps not
necessary) According to Žižek, **[the crises of capitalism are beginning
to reach apocalyptic proportions]{.underline}**. **[The old 'solutions'
of capitalism -- colonization, domination of world markets, outsourcing
of economic violence, exportation of poverty and so on -- are becoming
less and less effective]{.underline}**. **[We are increasingly
confronted with the excess of the excesses of capitalism. This is
especially the case with the rise of international terrorism as a
symptom of economic terror.]{.underline}** Nor is this simply a matter
of reflexivity along the lines of the risk society thesis. Rather it
draws into focus the very logic of capitalist reflexivity itself: t**[he
ways in which capitalism paradigmatically addresses and engages with its
own problems.]{.underline}** **[What the present conjuncture is tending
to bring about is a far more direct encounter with the drive-dynamics
(or Hegelian spirit) of capitalism]{.underline}**. Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the way in which today's politics connects with the
international economy. **[The global reach of capitalism and its
attendant crises]{.underline}** (viz the over-production of credit
precipitating 'toxic debt' on a hitherto unknown scale) **[means that
markets require increasing levels of political 4 intervention in order
to preserve their viability]{.underline}**. Against the regulationist
notions that the economy can, and should, be submitted to direct
political manipulation, what we are witnessing today is precisely the
opposite: the reduction of politics to a practice of global economic
sustainability. **[Notwithstanding the diversity of antagonisms and all
the sites of resistance, it is more and more the]{.underline}** Saint
Simonian **[nightmare of governance limited to the administration of
things (market mechanisms) that is prevailing]{.underline}**. (some

new]{.underline}**. So the question emerges: why and how did the
specific strategy of **[passing trade agreements with sweeping investor
protections and related provisions]{.underline}** emerge as a leading
form of this resistance over the past decade? Like neoliberalism more
broadly, these provisions are in large part a reaction to rapid changes
in international landscapes of competition since roughly the early
1970s. Seeking to cut costs, increase flexibility, and maintain
profitability, firms have paid ever more attention to the advantages of
locating various portions of their commodity chains in competing
national territories. Since the end of the cold war in particular, firms
have come to take many of the basic functions of states more for
granted, and so have felt freer to choose among national territories
from a truly global menu. **[These decades of accelerated, unstable
competition have made crises of accumulation appear far more
likely----the financial, industrial, and regulatory crises of the past
few years bearing witness to the validity of these fears]{.underline}**.
The sustainability of accumulation appears far less reliable than it did
for much of the postwar period. **[The ultimate valorization of capital
that firms have borrowed or advanced through the normal circuit of
capital]{.underline}**----i.e., through the production of commodities
sold in competitive markets----**[is thus especially
uncertain]{.underline}**. Locking in conditions of production for
individual firms helps to ensure the ultimate valorization of their
capital in two ways. First, it secures a competitive advantage for these
firms, if they are able to secure for themselves different and more
favorable conditions of production than their competitors have----e.g.,
exemption from environmental requirements that constrain their
competitors. Second and far more certain, though, the doctrine of
regulatory takings' or measures tantamount to expropriation' allows
firms to bypass the tremendously risky circuits of capital entirely, to
realize a healthy profit on their advanced capital by relying directly
on the power of states to tax their populations. In other words, rather
than competing in the marketplace for years, with all the risks that
entails----of technological change, changing markets, superior
competitors, and so on----firms claiming projected future revenues as
expropriated' property simply demand cash, now, from national
treasuries. It is a brilliant, if extremely limited, business plan, and
one that I believe falls squarely within the repertoire of primitive
accumulation. **[Like most capitalist responses to looming crisis, these
strategies do nothing to promote long-term economic or environmental
sustainability, and they set the stage for spatially and sectorally
larger versions of the underlying problems down the road]{.underline}**.
Clearly, firms cannot avoid engaging in capitalist production
altogether, which is what seeking compensation for hypothetical future
revenues amounts to. The production of new wealth would quickly dry up,
and no state could survive such extortion on ever-larger scales as other
firms copies the strategy. So, maintaining environmental regulations and
paying out untold billions of dollars to firms lining up at the treasury
door is untenable (this scenario highlights why this strategy amounts to
primitive accumulation, rather than capitalist accumulation proper).
**[The alternative possibility, of many individual firms securing
guaranteed stability in their conditions of production and so continuing
production without the burden of new regulations, does not lead so
quickly and directly to disaster, but the underlying logic is the
same]{.underline}**. Conditions of production are managed by the state,
with strong input from civil society, **[precisely because their
immersion in the marketplace leads inexorably to their degradation and
potential collapse]{.underline}**. Freezing conditions of
production----i.e., guaranteeing to specific firms that they will not
change from the moment they make an investment----is (to paraphrase
Chapter 11) tantamount to immersing them in the market, at least with
respect to environmental governance. This is because it is in the nature
of capitalist production that new possibilities, new problems, and new
dangers in the transformation and appropriation of nature by capital
will continue to emerge; tying the state's hand in regulating these
nearly guarantees environmental degradation. 18 Moreover, since
**[imperatives to homogenize conditions of production and attract
foreign investment are central to the neoliberal agenda embodied in
recent trade agreements]{.underline}**, limits on states' ability to
regulate conditions of production within their borders increase the
likelihood of races to the bottom' in terms of environmental regulation
and quality. Thus, crisis might be delayed as degraded conditions of
production in one place led to the relocation of production elsewhere,
but the end result would be the degradation of those conditions over
larger spatial scales, and thus the prospect of a larger crisis. Let us
hope that Polanyi was right: that such (neo)- liberal threats to the
fabric of society and the environment will call forth a sufficient
response from civil society, in the form of social movements, NGOs, and
other forms of activism, that will in turn place effective pressure on
states to make sustainability a higher priority in governance and deny
the privatization of conditions of production sought in the examples
here. As noted above, such responses are already underway, although
their prospects in a series of highly uneven struggles are uncertain at
best. What I have done here is to attempt to a small contribution at
filling in one of the pieces left underspecified in Polanyi's analysis:
that is, the actual politics of how both market liberalization and
resistance proceed in a given sphere, and how these dynamics of the
double movement fit into a more theoretically developed perspective on
the political economy of capitalist societies in general, and of
neoliberalism in particular.

### Ukraine Conflict Link

#### The 1AC's call to protect Ukraine from conflict is a neoliberal smokescreen that adds fuel to the fire of ongoing conflicts

**Rustin and Massey 14** (Michael Rustin and Doreen Massey; founding
editors of Soundings and coeditors with Stuart Hall of the Kilburn
Manifesto; 2014; "Rethinking the neoliberal world order";
<https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/s58_12rustin_massey_0.pdf>;
accessed 7/27/19; DS)

Then there is the **[Ukraine]{.underline}**, which **[can]{.underline}**
even more **[clearly be seen as unfinished business of the Cold
War]{.underline}**. The **[Ukraine is perceived as having yet to make
its full transition to the western, neoliberal model, being still
divided between its Russian and its European Union
affinities]{.underline}**. When a movement emerged to overthrow a
pro-Russian government, **[the Americans]{.underline}** and West
Europeans **[supported what was in effect a coup, and found themselves
once again involved on one side of a virtual civil war]{.underline}**.
As in many of these conflicts, including for example in Kosovo, the
initial agenda was established by militant factions, which were then
able (on various grounds of liberal sympathy, humanitarian concern or
cynical geopolitical interest) **[to draw western governments and
publics into giving them support, and even into fighting for
them]{.underline}**.16 There are two principal reasons why **[this
project of liberal imperialist transformation has had such disastrous
outcomes]{.underline}**, in particular in the Middle East. **[The first
is that military intervention, civil war and the breakdown of social
order destroy the basis of social trust on which the west's sought-after
democratic structures depend]{.underline}**. In the states of fear to
which people are reduced by civil violence, local forms of affiliation
and security are often sought, to replace those which were previously
given by the state and its laws. **[In the Balkans, populations
defaulted to ethnic and even religious identifications that had been
imagined to have lost their potency in post-war
Yugoslavia]{.underline}**. In Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, populations
have returned to religious and tribal sources of identity, as their
states have collapsed or have become largely criminal and
gangster-infested in their operation.17 Furthermore, **[the institutions
and values which the west ostensibly sought to advance through its
armie]{.underline}**s, special agents, contractors, **[bombings and
drones were discredited by the means by which they were being
imposed]{.underline}**.18 A second factor is that **[these societies
always had much more complex and deeply rooted forms of life than the
west's liberal colonisers understood]{.underline}**, or chose to
understand. They were also in certain respects already more 'western',
more capable of moving themselves in 'liberal' directions - for example
in such matters as education, emancipations of gender, technology and
science - than their colonisers and modernisers wished to recognise.
Thus Tony Blair's government was for once right in its view that
Gaddafi's government might be persuaded to engage in peaceful relations
with the west, if diplomatic efforts were made to bring this about.
**[The west also commonly exaggerates its own virtues when it sets its
liberal society up as a model for others]{.underline}**. Its own forms
of democracy are limited in their scope, and are distorted by the
interests of property and capital, as this Manifesto has documented. Its
cultures of individualism and consumption are often both crude and
violent, by comparison with other forms of social life. **[Forms of
government that may not be democratic according to the norms and
procedures of western constitutionalism, may nevertheless have their own
means of taking account of the wishes and interests of their citizens,
and may be more responsible, for example in regard to the crisis of
global warming, than some capitalist nations]{.underline}**.

## Critical Links

### Ableism Link

#### Capitalist exploitation structures all aspects of ableism and is a better explanation for the exploitation and deployment of the medical model of disability---the alternative is key to challenge the root cause of oppression.

**Grossman 4** **(**Brian, Ph.D. Student, Program in Medical Sociology,
Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of California,
San Francisco, Political economy perspectives on disability and aging:
Competing or complementary frameworks?, This paper was presented as part
of the panel on Issues in Disability and Aging at the conference, Social
Policy As if People Matter, to be held at Adelphi University in Garden
City, NY on November 11-12, 2004,
<http://www.adelphi.edu/peoplematter/pdfs/Grossman.pdf>**)**

**[Russell]{.underline}** (1998, 2001) **[takes a different approach to
the political economy of disability, situating her analysis within the
tradition of critical Marxism. She traces the effects of the
interactions between the economic structures and the political system as
they influence the lives of disabled people through state-supported
eugenics, the systematic exclusion of people with disabilities from the
labor force, and both the both corporate and charity-based privatization
of the public responsibilities of providing services and equipment for
people with disabilities.]{.underline}** In her book, Beyond Ramps:
Disability at the End of the Social Contract, **[Russell]{.underline}**
(1998) **[begins her political economic analysis with a critique of the
medical model of disability, that which seeks to cure the impairments of
people with disabilities, thereby situating disability as an individual
crisis or personal tragedy to be overcome or fixed. She argues that it
as a result of this model that political and financial efforts focus on
correcting the bodies and minds of individuals rather than on removing
barriers to social participation for people with disabilities.
Additionally, she indicates that the individualization of disability
that accompanies the medical model has historically been employed to
differentiate people with disabilities from the general population, to
cast them as abnormal, as less than human]{.underline}**. Next,
**[Russell]{.underline}** (1998) **[traces the shameful histories of
eugenics in the United States, England and Germany from the turn of the
20th century through World War II. She highlights the economic
rationalization of forced sterilization programs in the United States
and England and the mass extermination of first children, and then
adults, with disabilities in Hitler's Germany. In particular, she
describes how people with disabilities were characterized by the Nazi
government as drains on the social welfare system (due to their
inability to produce in a capitalist economic system while at the same
time requiring the state to spend money on their behalf). This economic
justification combined with the Social Darwinism of the time,
contributed to the creation of a state-supported program of eugenics of
people with disabilities that was not only sanctioned by but also
enforced by the medical establishment of the time]{.underline}**. From
the political economy of Nazi era eugenics, Russell (1998) moves to the
current debate over euthanasia and "the right to die" for people with
disabilities. Citing a study from the New England Journal of Medicine
that surveyed physicians in Oregon (the first state to legalize
euthanasia), she demonstrates the connections between financial
considerations and policies Grossman, 2004 around physician-assisted
suicide by recounting that in addition to the 60% of physicians who
reported supporting assisted suicide, 80% indicated that economics might
influence patient decisions. Moreover, she offers the example of Larry
McAfee, a quadriplegic in Georgia who, facing forced
institutionalization as a consequence of insufficient state-supported
programs that allow for independent living, petitioned the courts for
and was granted the right to suicide, as a further example of the
political bias toward the extermination of people with disabilities over
the provision of services. As a result, Russell (1998) is left asking
the haunting questions: "But are patients who face destitution really
choosing death? Or are they victims of Social Darwinist euthanasia
policy under which the rich can buy all the care they need while the
poor must do without?" (40). **[Continuing her exploration of the
political economy of disability, Russell (1998) provides a history of
the opposition to the passage of Social Security in the United States,
detailing the roles played by the private insurance industry and the
American Medical Association. In addition, she highlights the
difficulties that eligibility requirement for programs like Medicaid and
Social Security which require restricted incomes and/or limited assets
present for people with disabilities who want to work. Moreover, she is
extremely critical of the emphasis on private sector charities over a
public safety net.]{.underline}** In particular, she blasts Jerry Lewis
and his Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) for their **[portrayal of
people with disabilities as pitiable and in need of cures, as well as
the profit-making tactics that govern the distribution of funds raised
by the organization]{.underline}**. She provides evidence that
two-thirds of the money raised by MDA in 1991 was spent on overhead,
with only the remaining one-third of funds to be split between direct
patient services and research grants.Grossman, 2004 Furthermore,
**[Russell (1998) discusses the effect of the ideology of capitalism in
attracting the interest of then President George H.W. Bush to support
the Americans with Disabilities Act (what has since been touted as the
most sweeping piece of legislation for people with disabilities in the
history of the United States) as a low-cost way to reduce the number of
people on government assistance under the disguise of civil rights for
people with disabilities. In addition, she identifies economics as the
primary motivation for the political actions that initiated continuing
disability reviews (CDRs) and the multiple changes to federal
definitions of disability, both of which were intended to reduce access
to state systems of support.]{.underline}** In a later article,
**[Russell (2001) continues to elaborate on the relationships between
political and economic spheres as evidenced by her redefinition of
disabled people as "persons deemed less exploitable or not exploitable
by the owning class who control the means of production in a capitalist
economy" (87). She identifies the role of (the capitalist) class
interests in determining the level of participation in social life
afforded to people with disabilities through economically rationalized
decisions about both the exclusion and inclusion of people with
disabilities in the labor force at different times in America's
history]{.underline}** (i.e., sheltered workshops; unwillingness of
employers to offer accommodations, despite the ADA). Again, **[she
highlights the interplay between capitalist interests and the
medicalization of disability that result in a focus on curing the
individual, avoiding the institution of policies that remove barriers to
social and economic participation]{.underline}**. In "Mainfesto of an
Uppity Crip", the penultimate chapter of Beyond Ramps, **[Russell (1998)
outlines a plan for change, offering more than twenty-five suggestion
for anti-capitalist reform that include actions like ensuring greater
corporate accountability, instituting campaign finance reform, returning
the media to the public, adopting the principles of universal design to
public and private spaces, mandating a living wage, and replacing the
current mode of "institutional profiteering]{.underline}**" (222)
through the provision of Personal Assistance Services that support
people with disabilities living in the community. She **[concludes the
book by arguing for a renaissance of social solidarity across identity
groups against the capitalist class, a movement that would bring
differences together and revive public discourse.]{.underline}**

### Anarchy Link

#### Anarchy and the fetishization of insurrection is not an alternative---its tactics are easily commodified and appropriated by communicative capitalism. Anominity and indivuality, the core principles of anarchy trades off with a collectivity to destroy capital---maintaining structures of power and making exploitation inevitable

**Dean 2016 (**Jodi, Professor of Politics \[not political science,
science doesn't explain humans\] at Hobart and William Smith Colleges,
"Crowds and Party", pg. 139-143**)**

Ross links Rimbaud's crowd to changes at the level of the individual.
**[The crowd effects a de-individuation "that signals a devaluation of
individual subjectivity in favor of the construction of a (virtual)
group
subject]{.underline}**."[44](file:///C:\Users\Roberto\AppData\Local\Temp\gjo1shoh.mhx\OEBPS\10_Chapter03Robe9215rtoMonteromoluscoftwgmailcom.xhtml#fn-44)
She continues: "something is happening that cannot be seized without
letting go of the power to say 'I.'" I don't know why Ross includes
"virtual" parenthetically. **[I suspect that it has something to do with
her critique of the "mature" Marx and her rejection of class
politics]{.underline}**. Ross is **[looking for a subjectivity
emancipated from the confines of bourgeois life,]{.underline}** the
structured expectations of capitalism, and **[the "ordered
disorganization" of consumer culture]{.underline}**. **[She associates
this subjectivity with "the anarchist notion of individual liberty, of
individuality" against capitalist individualism]{.underline}** (italics
in
original).[45](file:///C:\Users\Roberto\AppData\Local\Temp\gjo1shoh.mhx\OEBPS\10_Chapter03Robe9215rtoMonteromoluscoftwgmailcom.xhtml#fn-45)
Ross **[wants to affirm this anarchist individuality, to retain it as a
locus of emancipation over and against a Marxist emphasis on
work]{.underline}**. **[The problem of capitalism in this view isn't the
exploitation of some for the enjoyment of others; it's the violence done
to individuality.]{.underline}** **[Capitalism commodifies and
anonymizes.]{.underline}** **[It dulls perception, enclosing desire into
a narrowness fit only for work and consumption]{.underline}**. Rimbaud's
poetry multiplies the senses in order to break the hold of capitalism on
the individualized body. **[It offers the "more-than-human" of the
"transformed utopian body of infinite sensation and libidinal
possibility as figure for the perfected community, for associative or
collective
life.]{.underline}**"[46](file:///C:\Users\Roberto\AppData\Local\Temp\gjo1shoh.mhx\OEBPS\10_Chapter03Robe9215rtoMonteromoluscoftwgmailcom.xhtml#fn-46)
The group subject is virtual because it is a marker for a potential
collectivity of unlimited individuality. A quarter century since Ross's
initial publication of her reading of Rimbaud, **[emphases on
individuality and potentiality resonate less with freedom than they do
with the dominion of capital.]{.underline}** **[Individuality is
communicative capitalism's primary value.]{.underline}** We are **[told
that each of us is unique, and enjoined to amplify, advertise, and
accelerate this uniqueness]{.underline}**. Our **[media is
personalized]{.underline}**, and we are encouraged to **[personalize it
even more]{.underline}**, for example, with apps and mobile phone cases
that meet our singular needs and express our singular brands. **[Those
looking for work are advised to make themselves stand out from the
crowd]{.underline}**, to **[distinguish themselves from
others]{.underline}** by offering that special something that will catch
an employer's eye. **[Capital accumulation depends on cultivating and
monetizing the new and different]{.underline}**. In an informational
milieu in which images and events are quickly absorbed in an infinite
media flow, **[attracting and retaining attention is extraordinarily
difficult]{.underline}**. Social media experts and data analytics
attempt to harvest and harness future possibilities, reminding us that
coming up with a unique personal brand, getting noticed, getting heard
is no simple matter. "Potential" is entrepreneurial buzzword and
securitizable wager. **[Corporations capture it and hedge funds bet on
its algorithmic variations. Individuality and potentiality point less to
new experiences of freedom than to new means of entrapment within
capitalist circuits. When the group marks only the potential of
unlimited individuality, it loses its political efficacy]{.underline}**.
It fails to make division appear, covering it over with the unifying
screen of
multiplicity.[47](file:///C:\Users\Roberto\AppData\Local\Temp\gjo1shoh.mhx\OEBPS\10_Chapter03Robe9215rtoMonteromoluscoftwgmailcom.xhtml#fn-47)
In Ross's version **[embodied sensation replaces the collective body of
the working class. Crowd affect displaces militant political
association.]{.underline}** At the same time, R**[oss's insights into
Rimbaud's figuring of the crowd suggest another reading of the crowd,
one that treats the devaluation of individual subjectivity as a
component of a process of collective subjectivization]{.underline}**.
Something is happening such that the capacity to say "I" is being
replaced by the will to say "we." This something is the crowd effect
rupturing the individual form. In another parenthetical, Ross writes:
**[the anonymous, blurry face in the crowd, the "man in the
street,"]{.underline}** as we say, is always one step away from becoming
"people in the streets": **[the crowd, the demonstration, the
insurrection]{.underline}**. The man in the street, **[the indistinct
element in a swarm of people, stripped of individual subjectivity,
faceless, is always on the point of becoming "political man," always
just at the limit of
action.]{.underline}**[48](file:///C:\Users\Roberto\AppData\Local\Temp\gjo1shoh.mhx\OEBPS\10_Chapter03Robe9215rtoMonteromoluscoftwgmailcom.xhtml#fn-48)
**[Anonymity marks the de-individuation necessary for collective
subjectivity]{.underline}**, the power number exerts in excess of
individual conscious decision. **[The blurring of distinctions that
concentrated urban life provides perches cities on the brink of
riot]{.underline}**. On the one hand, **[insofar as a single figure
stands in for a rebelling swarm, "political man" is a
misnomer]{.underline}**. On the other, **[that the swarm is not yet a
political subject, not yet a collectivity,]{.underline}** not yet
present to itself as a provisional being highlights the indeterminacy of
the crowd. **[Ross finds potential in the unformed]{.underline}**. She
values latency. Her rich descriptions of Rimbaud's crowds bring out the
destructuring capacities of swarms in ways that need not be
rearticulated with a freeing of individuality but can instead be
associated with the emergence of collective subjectivity. **[Ross
positions the "half-real, half-fantastic" crowd as an alternative to a
politics rooted in the well-defined interests of the
class]{.underline}**. **[It's not an alternative.]{.underline}** **[The
beautiful in-between of infinite potentiality can't last
forever]{.underline}**. People get tired. **[Some want a little
predictability]{.underline}**, reliable food sources, shelter, and
medical care. **[Others realize they're doing all the
work]{.underline}**. **[Without a politics that targets capitalists as a
class, the rest of us continue to be exploited]{.underline}** (even when
this exploitation is self-exploitation). **[Common work, knowledge,
achievements, and resources are expropriated from us and channeled into
the coffers of the very, very few]{.underline}**. Ross herself fully
recognizes the brevity of the Commune moment. Two months after the March
18 uprising, twenty-five thousand Communards were slaughtered in a
massacre far exceeding any of the events of the
Terror.[49](file:///C:\Users\Roberto\AppData\Local\Temp\gjo1shoh.mhx\OEBPS\10_Chapter03Robe9215rtoMonteromoluscoftwgmailcom.xhtml#fn-49)
**[The crowd isn't an alternative political arrangement; it's the
opening to a process of re-arrangement. What Ross celebrates is the
exciting cause of popular rupture with a dominant order, the crowd event
that ignites a subjective process]{.underline}**. What she avoids,
sometimes disavowing, is the subject support of this process in a
collective, partisan body. **[For example, even as Ross highlights the
erasure of divisions and the proliferation of political engagements
across diverse social classes, she nonetheless emphasizes the
working-class nature of the Commune, as if in covert fidelity to that
party that would insist on the egalitarian link between crowd discharge
and Commune form]{.underline}**. She lauds the reappropriation of
drunkenness, laziness, and licentiousness on behalf of the workers
against those who disparage them. A partisan position infuses Ross's
text (the foreword is by Terry Eagleton), yet she pushes it aside in a
fetishistic embrace of destabilization for its own sake. She concludes:
"**[the force of an idea lies primarily in its ability to be
displaced]{.underline}**." At first reading this is unconvincing,
requiring us to agree that the force in the Commune idea, for example,
lies in its ability to be displaced and not in its expression of popular
power. **[Any idea, image, or symbol can be displaced, resignified,
reappropriated, ironically redeployed, turned into a
meme.]{.underline}** At second glance, **[Ross's claim is simply wrong:
the force of a brand like Coke persists in its ability to resist
displacement, its capacity to retain its symbolic efficiency across
multiple registers and continue to designate a knot of beverage,
culture, and thirst-quenching, corporatized
contemporaneity]{.underline}** even when other words and proper names
occupy the place of its brand name, as we saw at the beginning of
chapter one. Better, then, **[is appropriating Ross's sentence against
itself: the force of an idea appears in the struggle over it, in its
capacity to serve as a site worth contesting. The force expresses the
subjectivity of a collective.]{.underline}**

### Anti-State Link

#### Anti-state politics fails as a starting point -- Only political methodology that begins from an effort to transform the state will avoid being recommodified

**Žižek '10** (Slavoj, Prof. of European Graduate School, Intl. Director
of the Birkbeck Inst. for Humanities, U. of London, and Senior
Researcher @ Inst. of Sociology, U. of Ljubljiana, *The Idea of
Communism*, "How to Begin from the Beginning," pgs. 209-224 bb)

Throughout the age of Really Existing Socialism, the secret hope of
democratic socialists\' was placed in the direct democracy of the
\'Sovi­ets\', workers\' councils as the form of self-organization of the
people; and it is deeply symptomatic how, with the decline of Really
Existing Socialism, this emancipatory shadow which haunted it all the
time has also disappeared. Is this not the ultimate confirmation of the
fact that the council-version of \'democratic socialism\' was just a
spectral double of the \'bureaucratic\' Really Existing Socialism, its
inherent transgression with no substantial positive content of its own,
i.e., unable to serve as the permanent basic organizing principle of a
society? This is a profoundly Hegelian lesson of abstract negation\':
the end of a constellation is not the victory of its counter-force, but
also the defeat of that counter-force. Of course,
egalitarian-emancipatory \'de-territorialization\' is not the same as
the postmodern-capitalist version, but it nonetheless radically changes
the terms of the emancipatory struggle: the enemy is no longer the
established hierarchic order of a State. **[How]{.underline}**, then,
**[are we to revo­lutionize an order whose very principle is constant
self-revolutionizing?]{.underline}** Rather than, or more than, a
solution to the problems we are facing today, communism is thus itself
the name of a problem: of the difficult task of breaking out of the
confines of the market-and-state frame, for which no quick formula is at
hand: \'It\'s just the simple thing that\'s hard, so hard to do\', as
Brecht put it in his \'In Praise of Communism\'. The Hegelian answer is
that the problem/deadlock is its own solution --- not in the
simple/direct sense that capitalism is already in itself communism, that
only a purely formal reversal is needed. My surmise is: **[what if
contemporary dynamic capitalism]{.underline}**, precisely in so far as
it is \'worldless\', a constant disruption of all fixed order, **[opens
up the space for a revo­lution which will break the vicious cycle of
revolt and its reinscription]{.underline}**, i.e., which will no longer
follow the pattern of an evental explosion after which things return to
normal, but will assume the task of a *new \'order­ing\' against the
global capitalist disorderl* **[Out of revolt we should move on
shamelessly to enforcing a new order.]{.underline}** (Is this not one of
the lessons of the ongoing financial meltdown?) This is why the focus on
capitalism is crucial if we want to reactualize the communist Idea:
today\'s worldless\' dynamic capitalism radically changes the very
coordinates of the commu­nist struggle --- the enemy is no longer the
State to be undermined from its point of symptomal torsion, but a flux
of permanent self-revolutionizing. Consequently, I want to propose two
axioms concerning the relation­ship between the State and politics. 1)
**[The failure of the Communist State]{.underline}** --Party politics
**[is above all]{.underline}** and primarily **[the failure of
anti-statist poli­tics]{.underline}**, of the endeavour to break out of
the constraints of State, to replace statal forms of organization with
direct\' non-representative forms of self-organization (\'councils\').
2) If you do not have an idea of what you want to replace the State
with, you have no right to subtract/withdraw from the State. **[Instead
of withdrawing into a distance from the State, the true task should be
to make the State itself work in a non-statal mode. The alternative
either struggle for State power]{.underline}** (which makes us the same
as the enemy we are fighting) **[or withdraw into a posture of
resistance from a distance towards the State\' is a false one, because
both its terms share the same premise: that a State-form]{.underline}**,
as we know it, **[is here to stay]{.underline}**, so that all we can do
is take over the State or maintain a distance towards it. Here, one
should shamelessly repeat the lesson of Lenin\'s *The State and
Revolution:* the goal of revolutionary violence is not to take over
State power, but to transform it, radically changing its functioning,
its relation to its base, etc. Therein resides the key component of the
\'dictatorship of the proletariat\' - Bulent Somay is right to point out
that what qualifies the proletariat for this position is ultimately a
*negative* feature: all other classes are (poten­tially) capable of
reaching the status of the \'ruling class\', in other words, of
establishing themselves as the class controlling the state apparatus:
what makes the working class into an agency and provides it with a
mission is neither its poverty, nor its militant and pseudo-military
organization, nor its proximity to the (chiefly industrial) means of
production. It is only its structural inability to organize itself into
yet another ruling class that provides the working class with such a
mission. The proletariat is the only (revolutionary) class in history
that abolishes itself in the act of abolishing its opposite.7 One should
draw from this insight the only appropriate conclusion: the
\'dictatorship of the proletariat\' is a kind of (necessary) oxymoron,
*not* a State-form in which the proletariat is the ruling class. **[We
effectively have the \'dictatorship of the proletariat\' only when the
State itself is radi­cally transformed, relying on new forms of popular
participation.]{.underline}** This is why there is more than hypocrisy
in the fact that, at the highest point of Stalinism, when the entire
social edifice was shattered by purges, the new constitution proclaimed
the end of the \'class\' character of Soviet power (voting rights were
restored to members of classes previously excluded), and that the
socialist regimes were called \'people\'s democracies\' --- a sure
indication that they were not \'dictatorships of the proletariat\' . . .
But, again, how to achieve such a \'dictatorship\'? Peter Sloterdijk
(definitely not one of us, but also not a complete idiot) remarked that
if there is one person to whom they will build monuments a hundred years
from now it is Lee Quan Yew, the Singapore leader who invented and
realized so-called \'capitalism with Asian values\'. The virus of this
**[authoritarian capitalism is slowly but surely spreading around the
globe.]{.underline}** Before setting in motion his reforms, Deng
Xiaoping visited Singapore and expressly praised it as a model for all
of China to follow. This change has a world-historical meaning: **[till
now, capitalism seemed inextricably linked with democracy]{.underline}**
--- there were, of course, from time to time recourses to direct
dictatorship, but, after a decade or two, democ­racy once again imposed
itself (recall only the cases of South Korea and Chile).
**[Now]{.underline}**, however, **[the link]{.underline}** between
democracy and capitalism **[has been broken. Why this
resurgence]{.underline}** of direct (non-democratic) authority? Above
and beyond cultural differences, **[there is an inner necessity for this
resur­gence in the very logic of today\'s capitalism.]{.underline}** That
is the central problem we are facing today: how does the late-capitalist
predominance (or even hegemonic role) of \'intellectual labour\' affect
Marx\'s basic scheme of the separation of labour from its objective
conditions, and of the revolution as the subjective re-appropriation of
those objective conditions? Spheres such as the internet, production,
exchange and consumption are inextri­cably intertwined, potentially even
identified: my product is immediately communicated to and consumed by
another. Marx\'s classic notion of commodity fetishism in which
\'relations between people\' assume the form of \'relations between
things\' has thus to be radically re-thought: in \'imma­terial labour\',
\'relations between people\' are \'not so much hidden beneath the veneer
of objectivity, but are themselves the very material of our everyday
exploitation\',^8^ so we can no longer talk about \'reification\' in the
classic Lukacsian sense. Far from being invisible, social relationality
in its very fluidity is directly the object of marketing and exchange:
in \'cultural capitalism\', one no longer sells (and buys) objects which
\'bring\' cultural or emotional experiences, one directly sells (and
buys) such experiences. While one has to acknowledge that Negri is here
on the trail of this key question, his answer seems too short; his
starting point is Marx\'s thesis in the *Grundrisse* on the radical
transformation of the status of \'fixed capital\': The development of
fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has
become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the
conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the
control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with
it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced,
not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of
social practice, of the real life process. With the development of
general social knowledge, the \'productive power of labour\' is thus
\'itself the greatest productive power. From the standpoint of the
direct production process it can be regarded as the production of fixed
capital, this fixed capital being man himself.\'^10^ And, again, since
capi­tal organizes its exploitation by appearing as \'fixed capital\'
against living labour, the moment the key component of fixed capital is
\'man himself, its \'general social knowledge\', the very social
foundation of capitalist exploita­tion is undermined, and the role of
capital becomes purely parasitic: with today\'s global interactive
media, creative inventiveness is no longer individ­ual, it is immediately
collectivized, part of \'commons\', such that any attempt to privatize
it through copyrighting becomes problematic --- more and more literally,
\'property is theft\' here. So what about a company like Microsoft that
does precisely this --- organizing and exploiting the collective synergy
of creative cognitive singularities? The only remaining task seems to be
to imagine how cognitive workers will \'eliminate bosses, because an
indus­trial control over cognitive work is completely *depasse.* What new
social movements signal is that \'the wage epoch is over, and that we
have passed from the confrontation between work and capital concerning
wages to the confrontation between the multitude and the State
concerning the instauration of the citizen\'s income\'.^12^ Therein
resides the basic feature of today\'s social revolutionary transition\':
\'One has to bring capital to recognize the weight and importance of the
common good, and if capital is not ready to do it, one has to compel it
to do [so.\'^1j^]{.smallcaps} Note Negri\'s precise formulation: not
abolish capital, but compel it to recognize the common good, i.e., one
remains within capitalism --- if ever there was a Utopian idea, this is
it. Here is how Negri describes the proximity of today\'s biopolitical
capitalism to the direct assertion of the productivity of the multitude:
The picture is one of a circulation of commodities, webs of informa­tion,
continuous movements, and radical nomadism of labour, and the ferocious
exploitation of these dynamics . . . but also of constant and
inexhaustible *exceed,* of the biopolitical power of the multitude and
of its excess with regard to the structural controlling ability of
dominant institutions. All of the available energies are put to work,
society is put to work . . . Within this exploited totality and
injunction to work lies an intransitive freedom that is irreducible to
the control that tries to subdue it. Even though freedom can run against
itself . . . lines of flight still open up in this ambivalence:
suffering is often productive but never revolutionary; what is
revolutionary is excess, overflow, and power. What we find here is the
standard post-Hegelian matrix of the produc­tive flux which is always in
excess with regard to the structural totality which tries to subdue and
control it. But what if, in a parallax shift, we perceive the capitalist
network itself as the true excess over the flow of the productive
multitude? What if, while the contemporary production of multitude
directly produces life, it continues to produce an excess (which is even
functionally superfluous), the excess of Capital? Why do immediately
produced relations still need the mediating role of capitalist
relations? What if the true enigma is: why does the continuous nomadic
\'molecular\' movement need a parasitic \'molar\' structure which
(decep­tively) appears as an obstacle to its unleashed productivity? Why
do we, the moment we abolish this obstacle/excess, lose the very
productive flux constrained by the parasitic excess? This also means
that we should turn around the topic of fetishism, of \'relations
between people appearing as relations between things\': what if the
direct \'production of life\' celebrated by Hardt and Negri is falsely
transparent, what if, in it, the invisible \'rela­tions between (the
immaterial, true) things (of Capital) appear as direct relations between
people? How did we come to this? **[The 1968 protests focused their
struggles against]{.underline}** (what were perceived as) **[the three
pillars of capitalism: factory, school, family.]{.underline}** As a
result, **[each domain was subsequently submitted to post-industrial
transformation]{.underline}**: factory-work is increasingly outsourced
or, in the developed world at least, reorganized on the basis of
post-Fordist non-hierarchical interactive team-work; permanent flexible
privatized education is increasingly replacing universal public
education; multi­ple forms of flexible sexual arrangements are replacing
the traditional family.^15^ **[The left lost in the very moment of its
victory]{.underline}**: the immediate enemy was defeated, but replaced
by a new form of even more direct capitalist domination. **[In
postmodern\' capitalism, the market is invad­ing new spheres which were
hitherto considered the privileged domain of the State, from education
to prisons and security]{.underline}**. When \'immaterial work\'
(education, therapy, etc.) is celebrated as the kind of work which
directly produces social relations, one should not forget what this
means within a commodity-economy: that new domains, hitherto excluded
from the market, are now commodified - when in trouble, we no longer
talk to a friend but pay a psychiatrist or counsellor to take care of
the problem; not parents but paid babysitters or educators take care of
children, etc. **[We are thus in the midst of a new process of the
privatization of the social, of establishing new
enclosures.]{.underline}**

### Anti-oppression Link

#### Anti-oppression community organizing must center capitalism- anything else gets coopted by liberal curriculum.

**Désil et al. '5** (Junie, Kirat Kaur, and Gary Kinsman,
Anti-oppression organizers, "Anti-Oppression Politics in Anti-Capitalist
Movements"
http://uppingtheanti.org/journal/article/01-anti-oppression-politics-in-anti-capitalist-movements/)

The modes of resistance and struggle that came out of liberation
movements in the latter part of the 20th century gave rise to
anti-oppression organizing and politics. Anti-oppression arose out of
the left's failure to develop a nuanced approach to questions of
oppression and to consider various forms of oppression as "class
issues." In recent years the rise of the anti-globalization movement has
influenced, and been influenced by, anti-oppression analyses, as the
movement sought to address the effects of global capitalism on different
communities and peoples, and to understand the varied effects of power,
privilege and marginalization in individual communities, as well as in
national and international contexts. Among social justice activists
organizing around anti-oppression politics, many questions have come up
as to how to envision and create a transformative politic around issues
of racism, sexism, heterosexism and able-ism within an anti-capitalist
analysis. **[The current separation of identity politics from class
struggle does not speak to the experiences of
marginalized]{.underline}** and exploited **[people in our communities,
and we need ways to discuss and organize around the connections between
various oppressions and capitalism.]{.underline}** As anti-oppression
activists, we need to develop a critical discourse that connects the
socio-historical contexts of capitalism and class to race, gender,
sexuality and ability. To the annoyance of some leftists who argue that
capitalism and class form the fundamental basis of all oppression,
anti-oppression organizing seeks to understand the connections between
racism, sexism, heterosexism, colonialism and class. **[Anti-oppression
politics have the potential to provide a useful antidote to reductionist
perspectives which leave out the fundamental roles of patriarchy and
racism]{.underline}** in determining both capitalism and class
relations. **[But is this happening? Or are anti-oppression activists
repeating the same mistakes made by proponents of identity politics in
the 1960s and 1970s, and being co-opted by the claimed multiculturalism
of the Canadian state?]{.underline}** Do anti-oppression politics expand
the analysis of radical organizing, or are they merely "reinventing the
wheel" by addressing individual behaviors? Can anti-oppression politics
provide a model for a multi-faceted analysis that addresses oppression
and class exploitation as distinct but nevertheless intimately
interrelated social relationships? **[The dynamics of anti-oppression
politics often reinforce notions of oppression that we should be trying
to debunk.]{.underline}** **[People of colour]{.underline}**, for
example, **[are often deemed anti-oppression "experts," and are expected
to do anti-oppression work for primarily white
organizations.]{.underline}** **[What are systemic issues then become
problems stemming from individual behaviour]{.underline}**, **[which can
lead to the de-politicization or political paralysis of activist
groups.]{.underline}** **[As the radical roots of anti-oppression in
feminist, anti-racist and queer movements become co-opted, the education
model developed by anti-oppression activists is being taken up by
mainstream, "multiculturalist" and liberal discourses.]{.underline}**

### Black Performance Link

#### The AFF is a predictably capitalist mode of performance whose rejection of political power plays exactly into the hands of power -- the attempt to divorce themselves from all criticism proves our link argument because it assumes that political abandonment has any potential to change anything 

**London 2016** (Dianca -- writer, music blogger, and follower of the
fictive craft, Beyoncé's capitalism, masquerading as radical change,
<http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/280129/beyonce-capitalism-black-activism/>)

As Jazmine Hughes [points out in this week's piece for
Cosmopolitan](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/a53323/beyonce-formation-essay/),
Beyoncé "knows that her activism is a conversation with her fans." For
Hughes and many others, this conversation "brings Beyoncé back to what
she does best: representing us while encouraging us to do better." But
[what if]{.underline} such [representation]{.underline} [leaves some of
us yearning for a conversation divorced from the very system that has
**historically profited** from black **bodies**, black **culture**, and
now black **activism**]{.underline}? If the "best revenge" or the answer
to progress "is your paper" as the lyrics to "Formation" suggest, Bey's
brand of activism is ultimately doomed. Viewing monetary prowess as
power is not only a familiar (and flawed) trope within her genre, **[it
is also a predictably capitalistic formula for agency.]{.underline}**
Prefaced by a reminder to "always stay gracious," Bey's suggested route
towards liberation is contingent on two things: respectability and the
mobility that comes with affluence. [Bey's respectability politics
operate on their own terms, allowing for her faithful followers to
ascend but only to a point. **The packaging may be different, but the
pedagogy is all too familiar.**]{.underline} [Resist or dismiss her
formula for agency and find yourself "eliminated," banished to the
fringe of black intellectualism and discourse.]{.underline} Bey's route
towards power in this sense is an ultimatum. As she addresses her
listeners ("ladies"), she urges them to "get into formation," to take
action, while keeping herself at the forefront as a role model and
example of how both "grace" and "paper" translates into power. "[Prove
to me you got some coordination," she demands. **Comply or be
silenced**]{.underline}. The options are clear: Utilize what Audre Lorde
would call "the master's tools" or be rendered irrelevant. In such
moments of contemplation, activist Bobby Seale's words in "[Seize the
Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P.
Newton](https://libcom.org/files/STT.pdf)" echo in my mind. "[The
cultural nationalists say that a Black man cannot be the enemy of the
Black people, while the Panthers believe that Black capitalists are
exploiters and oppressors]{.underline}. Although the [Black Panther
Party believes in Black nationalism and Black culture]{.underline}, it
[does not believe that either will lead to Black liberation or the
overthrow of the capitalist system, and are therefore
ineffective."]{.underline} Seale's words and the conviction that
"**[Black culture ... will \[neither\] lead to Black liberation or the
overthrow of the capitalist system"]{.underline}** feels like a timely
and relevant lens to apply when deconstructing representations of
blackness within mainstream culture. Yes, "Formation" and its viral
Super Bowl Sunday [performance is inherently a black
narrative]{.underline}, [yet]{.underline} its mode of presentation is
[rooted in the same corrupt system that has lead us to this historical
moment we stand in now. Activism and consumerism are one and the
same]{.underline}. **[Its impact is temporary and perhaps "ineffective"
in the long run due to being crafted by a capitalist]{.underline}** we
so lovingly call Bey. The impact of her latest single and the visually
arresting symbolism of her performance is undeniable, yet it is alarming
how we as a community unabashedly endorse without question or pause the
soft politics of pop icons. [It's problematic to consume without
caution, even if we see a reflection of ourselves, our mothers or
sisters in their narratives.]{.underline} [As much as we might feel
**empowered** by the grace of their choreography and the back beats of
their latest anthems]{.underline}, we as [black Americans should allow
ourselves the space to question the messages]{.underline} we are [given,
even if those messages are tailor-made for us]{.underline}. Whether
delivered via Tidal or Twitter, the politics of Beyoncé and similarly
monolithic celebrities should not be applauded without hesitation.

### Black Women Link

#### Black feminism \-\-- particularizing the nature of oppression and responses to it fractures both our understanding and responses to power -- soldifies the squo, doesn't disrupt it.

**Ferguson 2015** (Stephen FERGUSON, PhD in Philosophy from University
of Kansas, Associate Professor at North Carolina A&T State University,
15 \["Philosophy of African American Studies: Nothing Left of
Blackness," 2015, p. 178-182)

In this section, I examine how the production of knowledge is tied to
the exercise of power in Black Feminist Thought. Collins\'s standpoint
theory owes much to the French social theorist Michel Foucault. 79 Power
is discursive in nature for Collins. So, social relations of production
and social structures are greatly discounted in her social analysis. I
argue that **[her idealist conception of power has dire political
consequences]{.underline}**, that is, **[political
quietism]{.underline}**. From his studies of prisons, sexuality, and
medical discourse, Foucault spent a considerable amount of time
analyzing the relationship between knowledge and power. From a
Foucaultian perspective, the analysis of power cannot start with the
state apparatus, society\'s legal structures or the dominance of one
class over and against others. Rather, as Foucault often says, modern
power is a capillary form of domination. 80 That is, power does not
emanate from some central source, bur circulates throughout the body
politic via a plurality of everyday micropolitics. This regime of
power/knowledge comprises \"microtechniques,\" institutional practices,
regimes of knowledge, forms of social and political constraint that are
local, continuous, capillary, and exhaustive. The fullest account of the
disciplinary origins of modern power can be found in volume one of
Foucault\'s History of Sexuality. In this work, he discusses the modern
macrostrategy of \"bio-power,\" the management of the production and
reproduction of life in modern society. Here Foucault turns his gaze on
such issues as population, health, urban life, and sexuality, which are
to be administered, repressed, and controlled. He also gives us his most
succinct discussion of power. To correctly understand power, he argues,
we have to focus on the \"multiplicity of relations of force.\" Foucault
argues: The condition of possibility of power \... should not be sought
in the primary existence of a central point, in a unique space of
sovereignty whence would radiate derivative and descendent forms;\...
Power is everywhere: not that it engulfs everything, but that it comes
from everywhere.Kl **[Power is everywhere, and so ultimately
nowhere]{.underline}**. In the realm of political philosophy, Foucault
argues, we need to displace our conception of power from any notion of
the State, social relations, or social institutions. This approach
forces us to focus on discourse (i.e., the attitudes and beliefs people
hold) rather than the social structural relations that produce and
reproduce power. **[This conception of power opens up the door for a
focus on \"identity politics\" vis-a-vis class struggle as the basis for
political struggle]{.underline}**.82 Despite the \"omnipresence of
power\" Foucault informs us: \"Resistance is integral to power.\" 83 By
disconnecting power from its social basis in capitalist exploitation,
where an essential division between the powerful and powerless is
materially determined, I agree with Stephen Tumino who astutely notes,
Foucault\'s theory becomes \"part of the dream of a perfectly governed
utopia, albeit with the spectacle of resistance but, just the same, with
no social revolutions.\" 84 Foucault\'s concept of power leads us down
the intellectual road of political quietism and inertia; for the
ultimate conclusion to Foucault\'s political odyssey was stoicism, that
is, a subjectivist passivity in the wake of objective crisis.85 **[At no
point in Black Feminist Thought does Collins suggest that Black women
can be empowered by taking control of the bourgeois state apparatus or
overthrowing capitalism.]{.underline}** **[For Collins, class production
relations cannot adequately explain power]{.underline}**. Power is
discursive in nature for Collins. **[Perhaps, this explains Collins\'s
eagerness to erase Black women who are
socialist/Communist]{.underline}** from Black women\'s thought and
practice. In fact, **[little value is placed on the diversity of
ideological and political perspectives]{.underline}** among Black women.
**[The Black philosopher Joy James posits]{.underline}**: Unfortunately,
**[Black Feminist Thought]{.underline}** also **[elides black female
radicals. Reconstructing historical radicals as liberals, it
deradicalizes militant women]{.underline}** to generalize movement women
activists as wedded to liberal politics. Collins redefines most forms of
black women\'s anti-racist work, including social work, as
\"radicalism.\" In so doing, her text serves as a primary example for
the erasure of the black women radical\... **[Collins implicitly defines
as revolutionary all black women who survive and thereby resist
oppression, even if they do not engage in public activism or
confrontation with the state]{.underline}**.81\' Collins\'s depiction of
Black women\'s thought and practice is rather generic. By implication,
all political and ideological tendencies among Black women are seen as
radical or revolutionary. However, socialist and/or communist women arc
excluded from \"Black feminist thought\" precisely because of their
focus on empowering Black women by taking control of the bourgeois state
apparatus or overthrowing capitalism. Joy James highlights a crucial
issue in determining the plausibility of Collins\'s project. If Black
women\'s experiences constitute the ground for Black feminist thought,
is Collins guilty of erasing the differences within Black feminist
thought? Moreover, if it is recognized that there are various, and
sometimes necessarily contradictory, "women\'s standpoints," how do we
decide which one is the "real" Black women\'s standpoint? Collins\'s
version of standpoint theory is problematic because it implies a
misplaced essentialism in assuming that all Black women will necessarily
have a shared standpoint, that is, a \"Black feminist consciousness.\"
In the spirit of Foucault, Collins develops the notion of \"matrix of
domination\" to underscore that one\'s position in society is made up of
multiple standpoints as opposed to one essential standpoint. Taking a
poststructural turn, **[Collins emphasizes the \"interlocking\" nature
of]{.underline}** the wide variety of social positions or
**[identities]{.underline}** (e.g., race, class, gender, nationality,
sexual orientation) that make up our standpoint and, by extension, our
oppression. The intcrsectionality of race, class, and gender is supposed
to be analogous to the autonomous structures of racism, sexism, and
\"classism.\" So, **[our standpoint emerges from our fragmented
identities that are, consequently, shaped by racism, sexism, and
\"classism.\"]{.underline}** But what interests Collins the most is the
manner in which intersectionality gives rise to different kinds of lived
experiences, social realities, and power relations. Collins sees
intersectionality working in tandem with a matrix of domination. In line
with Foucault, she stresses that where there are sites of domination,
there are also potential sites of resistance. Given the rival sets of
experiences that constitute the subject, our experiences are often times
contradictory rather than complementary. The concept of
\"intersectionality\" is **[antithetical to a Marxist (class) analysis
of racism and sexism.]{.underline}** **[The supposed economic
determinism of Marxism is replaced by a \"politics of difference.\"
Although class is included]{.underline}** **[in the triumvirate of
\"race, class and gender,\"]{.underline}** **[class is really displaced
as another \"difference.\"]{.underline}** **[In such
formulations]{.underline}**, **[race and gender identities -- as
separate and autonomous spheres -- are severed from the material context
of class formation, capitalist social relations, class exploitation,
and, ultimately, class struggle. A class analysis does not reduce all
forms of oppression to class]{.underline}** or \"classism.\" Instead,
**[it is a mode of analysis that renders capitalism as context and
grounds for the explanation of racism and sexism on a materialist
basis]{.underline}**. Racism is not reducible to class relations. But,
**[we cannot begin to understand the mechanism of racism and ultimately
eradicate it without understanding and transforming its material and
ideological grounds in capitalism]{.underline}**. 87 This is born out in
such works as *Class Struggle in France,1848-1850*, *The Condition of
the Working-Class in England*, and *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte*. The same can be said of works by Black historians in the
tradition of Marx, Engels, and Lenin such as C. L. R. James\'s *The
Black Jacobin* and Walter Rodney\'s *How Europe Underdeveloped
Africa*.88 **[In order to change the relations of
domination]{.underline}** (i.e., the oppression and exploitation which
structure bourgeois civil society and our lives) we must understand how
power works, and thus **[we need a viable theory of
power]{.underline}**. In class societies -- it should be obvious but let
me say it anyway -- power is not distributed equally. Power is a
structural relationship (usually mediated by way of the State) based on
the \"difference\" between those who own the means of production (as a
class) and those who do not own these means of production and,
consequently, must sell their labor power in order to survive. Power,
from this standpoint, functions to reproduce oppression and
exploitation. To argue otherwise, as Collins does, results in blurring
the fundamental (but not only) contradiction under capitalist societies.
**[Exploitation]{.underline}**, from the standpoint of Marxism,
**[derives from one\'s objective relations to the means of
production]{.underline}** where power is attached to owning the means of
production. **[Because the working-class is not in possession of the
means of production, they are subject to exploitation]{.underline}** in
the sphere of production. **[Black, Asian, Latino/a, and white --
whether male or female -- workers are exploited under
capitalism]{.underline}**. 89 **[But, not all Black people or people of
color are subject to exploitation]{.underline}** **[in the Marxist
sense.]{.underline}** **[Some Black people as a result of their
relationship to the means of production are exploiters and
oppressors.]{.underline}** Here we could mention Kenneth I. Chenault
(Chairman and CEO of American Express), Ursula Burns (CEO of Xerox),
Rosalind G. Brewer (President and CEO of Sam\'s Club, a division of
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.), Carl Horton (former CEO of the Absolut Spirit
Company Inc.), or Robert Parsons (former CEO of AOL Time Warner). 9° Can
we seriously claim that Powell, Barack Obama, Condoleezza Rice, Susan E.
Rice, or even Oprah Winfrey are oppressed with respect to a white
working-class male? **[Rather than employ a materialist (structural)
analysis of oppression and exploitation]{.underline}**, with Collins,
**[we are left with a culturalist narrative that reduces \"such
difference to a question of knowledge/power relations]{.underline}**
which can be \'dealt with\' (negotiated) on a discursive level without a
fundamental change in the relations of production.\" 91 **[We have an
\"ersatz politics\" aimed at intervening at the level of
ideas]{.underline}**, that is, **[the sphere of cultural representation
as an end in itself]{.underline}**.92 As John McClendon observes:
\[Collins\'\] epistemological position ushers in nothing less than a
politics of compromise. Ostensibly the suggestion is a most debilitating
political proposal, viz., pursue the politics of recognition. Moreover,
**[the upshot of this epistemology of dialogical truth is not a politics
of liberation but an ethics of reconciliation between the oppressed and
the oppressors.]{.underline}** In ideological terms, **[we are left with
inept liberal moralism serving as a surrogate for political struggle,
that is to say, political struggle guided by revolutionary theory and
scientific epistemology]{.underline}**.93

### Deleuze Link

#### Deleuzian theories deny the labour of doing politics which is critical to the formulation of enduring political forms that can engender communist -- their becoming is just passive, capitalist ideology.

**Noys 2008 (**Benjamin, Reader in English at the University of
Chichester, Through a Glass Darkly: Alain Badiou's critique of
anarchism,
https://www.academia.edu/216175/Through_a_glass_darkly_Alain_Badiou_s_critique_of_anarchism)

Badiou's critique of anarchism operates indirectly; it attacks what
Daniel Bensaïd describes as **['\[a\] neo-libertarian current, more
diffuse but more influential than the direct heirs of anarchism
...\[which\] constitutes a state of mind, a 'mood', rather than a
well-defined orientation]{.underline}**.' (Bensaïd 2005: 170). One of
Badiou's examples of this tendency, targeted while he was still a
Maoist, is Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's book Anti-Oedipus (1972).
**[This]{.underline}** book, with its **[vision of a flux of desire that
can escape]{.underline}** the **[constraints]{.underline}** of both
capitalism and the 'prison' of the Freudian Oedipus complex, not only
**[had a significant influence on]{.underline}** the libertarians of the
movements after May 68 but also on later anarchists and
**[postanarchists]{.underline}**. Where anarchists have tended to
celebrate their theories of the uncontrollable fluxes of desire
**[Badiou sarcastically comments: 'Unforeseeable, desiring, irrational:
follow your drift, my son, and you will make the
Revolution]{.underline}**.' (2004: 76). This point summarises Badiou's
general scepticism towards what he regards as the **[anarchist faith in
the 'pure' movement of resistance]{.underline}**, a movement that
**[seems to operate without the need for aim or direction but will
somehow still result in revolution.]{.underline}**¶ Badiou refines this
general scepticism in making a series of more precise criticisms of the
'libertarian current'. He argues that the central problem of
**[this]{.underline}** current is that it **[sets up a simple-minded
opposition between power and resistance]{.underline}** **[(or revolt, or
rebellion). The result is a sterile set of 'static dualisms', from which
is derived 'the catechism of the System and the Flux, the Despot and the
Nomad, the Paranoiac, and the Schizo']{.underline}** (Badiou 2004: 80).
In this case Badiou is explicitly referring to a number of oppositions
that structure the text of Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus , in
which **[the second term is valorised at the expense of the
first]{.underline}**. The problem with **[such dualisms]{.underline}**
**[is that they fail to grasp the actual way politics operates: 'power'
is not one monolithic whole, and neither is 'resistance'.]{.underline}**
**[Instead the task of 'doing politics' involves a closer analysis of
different forces and contradictions as well as]{.underline}**, for
Badiou, **[the formation of the party as a form to handle and organise
these contradictions]{.underline}**. Whatever we might think of the
second point we can, I think, accept the first is well made. While there
may be a polemically or motivational gain in presenting politics in
terms of a grand opposition, and there may well be times where struggle
operates in this form, more often matters are considerably more
complex.¶ For Badiou these kind of oppositions are reflective of the
limits of the French political scene of the 1970s: namely the opposition
between the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser, which finds its
model in the French Communist Party, and the philosophy of desire of
Deleuze and Guattari that gave voice to, and which finds its model in
the dispersion of the little groups of libertarians ('groupuscules'). In
the first we find the relentless and paralysing insistence on the power
of structure and, in the second, the celebration of 'pure' revolt. We
can see here the origin of Badiou's later contention that the anarchist
model mirrors the communist party model. **[Anarchists oppose their
small groups to the supposedly 'monolithic' style of the communist
party. What they fail to recognise are the fissures and contradictions
that run through both power and resistance]{.underline}**. In this
period **[Badiou, and the UCFML, are groping towards a new party-form
that would be able to negotiate a dialectical reading of politics that
could engage with force and place, disruption and structure, without
reifying one of the terms against the other.¶ The irony is that
defenders of Deleuze and Guattari, or]{.underline}** Michel **[Foucault,
whom Badiou also attacks, will argue that they present a model of power
and resistance as multiple, fluid, and unstable -- precisely not a
binary. Badiou, however, is correct to note a tendency to re-constitute
new binaries in these modes of thinking: 'Schizo vs.
Paranoid']{.underline}** (Deleuze and Guattari), '**[Pleb vs.
Power']{.underline}** (Foucault), **[or 'Multitude vs.
Empire']{.underline}** (Negri and Hardt). In each case **[the attempts
at anti-dialectical thinking risk becoming merely
un-dialectical.]{.underline}** Badiou himself certainly changes the
terms of his own thinking, but he retains the mistrust of what he
regards as this fundamental libertarian or anarchist schema. So, in the
later Being and Event (2005) Badiou will critique what he calls
'speculative leftism', which believes in the 'pure' event of revolt --
the miracle of revolt appearing out of nothing.2 Again his point here is
**[there is a faith in the emergence of a force of revolt posed against
a static sense of power, without any real attempt to analyse the
possibilities and limits the forces that would compose this
'revolt']{.underline}**. This faith in the miracle of the event of
revolt is coupled, Badiou argues, with a sense of the inevitable defeat
of such revolts by power. The result is that we are left in the
situation of fighting an endless (losing) war -- alternating between the
eruption of revolt out of nothing and then its inevitable return to
nothing.¶ More recently Badiou has focused his criticisms on the
thinking of Antonio Negri (author, with Michael Hardt, of Empire
(2000)), and his influence on the 'movement of movements'. Badiou tends
to conflate Negri with the 'movement of movements', and while it is true
that the language and thinking of Negri has had considerable influence
it has by no means passed uncontested. Badiou modulates his earlier
general criticisms of anarchism / libertarian positions but stays within
the same general frame: Negri is not truly opposed to capitalist
'Empire' but instead romanticises the power of capitalism:¶ As is well
known, for Negri, the Spinozist, there is only one historic substance,
so that the capitalist empire is also the scene of an unprecedented
communist deployment. This surely has the advantage of authorizing the
belief that the worse it gets, the better it gets; or of getting you to
(mis)take those demonstrations -- fruitlessly convened to meet wherever
the powerful re-unite -- for the 'creation' and the 'multiform
invention' of new petit-bourgeois proletarians. (Badiou 2006: 45)¶
Therefore **[Negri cuts the ground from under any truly anti-capitalist
politics by being overly fascinated with the mobile power of
capital]{.underline}**. At the same time **[he is overly hopeful about
the powers of resistance on this ground, offering only a 'dreamy
hallucination']{.underline}** (Badiou 2003: 126) **[of the power of the
'multitude', which lacks the discipline to properly detach itself from
the state.¶]{.underline}** Badiou's critique of
**[anarchism]{.underline}** ranges across a number of repeated and
modulated criticisms. At the fundamental level it involves a constrained
sense of the possibilities of politics that **[remains in a dualism of
resistance versus power. This monolithic conception prevents a properly
political assessment of the complex arrangements of political power and
the means by which capitalist and state power might not only be resisted
but also overthrown. This static dualism often leaves the origin of
revolt unexplained or undetermined]{.underline}**. It seems to come from
nowhere and also to go nowhere; the 'miracle' of revolt is always doomed
to defeat or recuperation. Also, **[this dualism leads to a structure of
mirroring between anarchism and state]{.underline}** or capitalist
**[power]{.underline}**. **[The invocations of drift and liberation
found in the libertarian current are dangerously close to the
ideological forms of capitalism itself]{.underline}**. For Badiou, this
means that **[anarchism lacks the ability to 'construct new forms of
discipline to replace the discipline of political
parties']{.underline}** (Badiou 2003: 126). Of course anyone
knowledgeable of the history of anarchism will recognise these kinds of
criticism, particularly as it has often been advanced by Marxists. But
it is the vehemence with which Badiou poses these questions in the
present context, and his choice of theoretical targets that make them
worth considering as critical questions -- especially since, as we will
see, some voices within the movement have arrived at similar
conclusions.

### Discourse Link

#### **The 1ac's focus on discourse and language trades off with a focus on material relations, this strategy devolves to pure historization and narration that precludes the possibility of revolution**

**Eagleton 97** **(**Terry, Distinguished Professor of English
Literature at Lancaster University, Professor of Cultural Theory at the
National University of Ireland and Distinguished Visiting Professor of
English Literature at The University of Notre Dame, 1997, "Where do
Postmodernists Come from?", In Defense of History**)**

**[Imagine a radical movement that had suffered an emphatic defeat. So
emphatic, in fact, that it seemed unlikely to resurface]{.underline}**
for the length of a lifetime, if at all. As time wore on, the beliefs of
this movement might begin to seem less false or ineffectual than simply
irrelevant. For its opponents, it would be less a matter of hotly
contesting these doctrines than of contem­plating them with something of
the mild antiquarian interest one might have previously reserved for
Ptolemaic cosmology or the scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas. **[Radicals
might come to find themselves less over­whelmed or out-argued than simply
washed up,]{.underline}** speaking a language so quaintly out of tune
with their era that, as with the language of Platonism or courtly love,
nobody even bothered any longer to ask whether it was true. **[What
would be the likely response of the left to such a dire
condition?]{.underline}** Many, no doubt, would drift either cynically
or sincerely to the right, regretting their earlier views as infantile
idealism. Others might keep the faith purely out of habit, anxiety, or
nostalgia, clinging to an imaginary identity and risking the neurosis
that that may bring. A small clutch of left triumphalists, incurably
hopeful, would no doubt carry on detecting the stirrings of the
revolution in the faintest flicker of militancy. In others, the radical
impulse would persist, but would be forced to migrate elsewhere. One can
imagine that **[the ruling assumption of this period would be that the
system was, at least for the moment, unbreachable; and a great many of
the left's conclusions could be seen to flow from this glum supposition.
One might expect, for example, that there would be an upsurge of
interest in the margins and crevices of the system]{.underline}**---in
those ambiguous, indeterminate places where its power seemed less
secure. **[If the system could not be breached, one might at least look
to those forces which might momentarily transgress,]{.underline}**
subvert, or give it the slip. **[There would be]{.underline}**, one
might predict, **[much celebration of the marginal]{.underline}**---but
this would be partly **[making a virtue out of necessity]{.underline}**,
since the left would itself have been rudely displaced from the
mainstream, and might thus come, conveniently enough, to suspect all
talk of centrality as suspect. At its crudest, **[this cult of
marginality would come down to a simpleminded assumption that minorities
were positive and majorities oppressive]{.underline}**. .Just how
minorities like fascist groups, Ulst ^6^ Unionists, or the international
bourgeoisie fitted into this picture would not be entirely clear. Nor is
it obvious how such a position could cope with a previously marginal
movement---the ANC, for example---becoming p~0~\]j~t~j cally dominant,
given its formalist prejudice that dominance was undesir­able as such.
**[The historical basis for this way of thinking would be the fact that
political movements that were at once mass, central, and creative were
by and large no longer in business.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[the idea
of a movement]{.underline}** that [**was at once central and subversive
would now appear something of a contradic­tion in terms. It would
therefore seem natural to demonize the mass dominant, and consensual,
and romanticize whatever happened to deviate from them. It would
be,**]{.underline} above all, **[the attitude of those younger
dissidents who had nothing much, politically speaking, to remember, who
had no actual memory or experience of mass radical politics, but a good
deal of experience of drearily oppressive majorities.]{.underline}** If
the system really did seem to have canceled all opposition to itself,
then it would not be hard to generalize from this to the vaguely
anarchistic belief that *system* is oppressive as such. Since there were
almost no examples of attractive political systems around, the claim
would seem distinctly plausi­ble. **[The only genuine criticism could be
one launched from outside the system altogether; and one would expect,
therefore, a certain fetishizing of "otherness" in such a
period]{.underline}**. There would be enormous interest in anything that
seemed alien, deviant, exotic, unincorporable, all the way from aard-
varks to Alpha Centauri, a passion for whatever gave us a tantalizing
glimpse of something beyond the logic of the system altogether. **[But
this romantic ultra-leftism would coexist]{.underline}**, curiously
enough, **[with a brittle pessimism---for the fact is that if the system
is all-powerful, then there can be by definition nothing beyond
it,]{.underline}** any more than there can be anything beyond the
infinite curvature of cosmic space. If there *were* something outside
the system, then it would be entirely unknowable and thus incapable of
saving us; but if we could draw it into the orbit of the system, so that
it could gain some effective foothold there, its otherness would be
instantly contaminated and its sub­versive power would thus dwindle to
nothing. **[Whatever negates the system in theory would thus be
logically incapable of doing so in practice]{.underline}**. Anything we
can *understand* can by definition not be radical, since it must be
within itself; but anything which escapes the system could be heard by
^thC^ \^no more than a mysterious murmur. ^llS\ ,S^.\| thinking has
abandoned the whole notion of a system which is nally
contradictory---which has that installed at its heart which can
\'^!lter^ tially undo it. Instead, it thinks in the rigid oppositions of
"inside" and «°u tside " where to be on the inside is to be complicit
and to be on the outside •°to be impotent. **[The typical style of
thought of such a period, then, might be described as libertarian
pessimism]{.underline}**---libertarian, because one would not have given
up on the dream of something quite other than what we have; pessimism,
because **[one would be much too bleakly conscious of the om­nipotence of
law and power to believe that such a dream could ever be
realized.]{.underline}** If one still believed in subversion, but not in
the existence of any flesh-and-blood agents of it, then it might be
possible to imagine that the system in some way subverted itself,
deconstructed its own logic, which would then allow you to combine a
certain radicalism with a certain skepticism. If the system is
everywhere, then it would seem, like the Almighty himself, to be visible
at no particular point; and it would therefore become possible to
believe, paradoxically enough, that whatever was out there was not in
fact a system at all. It is only a short step from claiming that the
system is too complex to be represented to declaring that it does not
exist. In the period we are imagining, then, **[some would no doubt be
found clamoring against what they saw as the tyranny of a real social
totality, whereas others would be busy deconstructing the whole idea of
totality and claiming that it existed only in our minds. It would not be
hard to see this as]{.underline}**, at least in part, a **[compensation
in theory for the fact that the social totality was proving difficult to
crack in practice. If no very ambitious form of political action seems
for the moment possible, if]{.underline}** so-called **[micropolitics
seem the order of the day, it is always tempting to convert this
necessity into a virtue---to console oneself with the thought that one's
political limitations have a kind of objective ground in reality, in the
fact that social "totality" is in any case just an illusion.
("Metaphysical" illusion makes your position sound rather more
imposing.) It does not matter if there is no political agent at hand to
transform the whole, because there is in fact no whole to be
transformed]{.underline}**. It is as though, having mislaid the
breadknife, one declares the loaf to be already sliced. [**But totality
might also seem something of an illusion because there would be no very
obvious political agent for whom society might present itself as a
totality**.]{.underline} There are those who need to grasp how it stands
with them in order to be free, and who find that they can do this only
by grasping something of the overall structure with which their own
immediate situation intersects. Local and universal are not, here,
simple opposites or theoretical options, as they might be for those
intellectuals who prefer to think big and those more modest academics
who like to keep it concrete But if some of those traditional political
agents are in trouble, then so will be the concept of social totality,
since it is those agents' *need* of it that gives it its force. Grasping
a complex totality involves some rigorous analysis; so it is not
surprising that such strenuously systematic thought should be out of
fash- x ion, dismissed as phallic, scientistic, or what have you, in the
sort of period *Cf J* we are imagining. **[When there is nothing in
particular in it for you to find out how you stand---if you are a
professor in]{.underline}** Ithaca or [**Irvine, for example--- you can
afford to be ambiguous, elusive, deliciously indeterminate. You are also
quite likely**,]{.underline} in such circumstances, **[to wax
idealist---though in some suitably newfangled rather than tediously
old-fashioned sense]{.underline}**. For one primary way in which we know
the world is, of course, through practice; and if any very ambitious
practice is denied us, it will not be long before we catch ourselves
wondering whether there is anything out there at all. One would expect,
then, that in such an era a belief in reality as something that resists
us ("History is what hurts," as Fredric Jameson has put it) will give
way to a belief in the "constructed" nature of the world.
[**This**,]{.underline} in turn, **[would]{.underline}** no doubt [**go
hand in hand with a full-blooded "culturalism" which under­estimated what
men and women had in common as material human crea­tures,**]{.underline}
and suspected all talk of nature as an insidious mystification. It would
tend not to realize that such culturalism is just as reductive as, say,
econo- mism or biologism. Cognitive and realist accounts of human
consciousness would yield ground to various kinds of pragmatism and
relativism, partly because there didn't any longer seem much politically
at stake in knowing how it stood with you. [**Everything would become an
interpretation, includ­ing that statement itself. And what would also
gradually implode, along with reasonably certain knowledge, would be the
idea of a human subject "cen­tered" and unified enough to take
significant action**.]{.underline} For such **[significant action would
now seem in short supply]{.underline}**; and [**the
result**,]{.underline} once more, **[would be to make a virtue out of
necessity by singing the praises of the diffuse]{.underline}**,
decentered, schizoid human subject---**[a subject who might well not be
"together" enough to topple a bottle off a wall, let alone bring down
the state, but who could nevertheless be presented as hair-raisingly
avant-garde in trast to the smugly centered subjects]{.underline}** of
an older, more classical phase *^c0^* pitalism. To put it another way:
**[the subject as producer]{.underline}** (coherent, disciplined,
self-determining) **[would have yielded ground to the subject as
consumer]{.underline}** (mobile, ephemeral, constituted by insatiable
desire). **If** the "left" orthodoxies of such a period were pragmatist,
relativist, pluralistic, deconstructive, then one might well see such
thought-forms as dangerously radical. **[For does not capitalism need
sure foundations, stable identities, absolute authority, metaphysical
certainties, in order to survive? And wouldn't the kind of thought we
are imagining put the skids under all this? The answer, feebly enough,
is both yes and no.]{.underline}** It is true that capitalism, so far
anyway, has felt the need to underpin its authority with unimpeach­able
moral foundations. Look, for example, at the remarkable tenacity of
religious belief in North America. On the other hand, look at the
British, who are a notably godless bunch. No British politician could
cause anything other than acute embarrassment by invoking the Supreme
Being in public, and the British talk much less about metaphysical
abstractions like Britain than those in the United States do about
something called the United States. **[It is not clear,]{.underline}**
in other words, **[exactly how much metaphysical talk the advanced
capitalist system really requires]{.underline}**; and it is certainly
true that its relentlessly secularizing, rationalizing operations
threaten to undercut its own metaphysical claims. **[It is clear,
however, that without pragmatism and plurality the system could not
survive]{.underline}** at all. **[Difference, "hybridity,"
hetero­geneity, restless mobility are native to the capitalist mode of
production, and thus by no means inherently radical phenomena. So if
these ways of thinking put the skids under the system at one level, they
reproduce its logic at another. If an oppressive system seems to
regulate everything, then one will naturally look around for some
enclave of which this is less true---some place where a degree of
freedom or randomness or pleasure still precariously survives. Perhaps
you might call this desire, or discourse, or the body, or the
unconscious. One might predict in this period a quickening of interest
in psychoanalysis---for psychoanalysis is not only the thinking person's
sensationalism,]{.underline}** blending intellectual rigor with the most
lurid materials, **[but it exudes a general exciting air of radicalism
without being particularly so politically. If the more abstract
questions of state, mode of production, and civil society seem for the
moment too hard to resolve, then one might shift one's political
attention to something more intimate and immediate, more living and
fleshly, like the body]{.underline}**. Conference papers entitled
"Putting the Anus Back into Coriolanus" would attract eager crowds who
had never heard of the bourgeoisie but who knew all about buggery. This
state of affairs would no doubt be particularly marked in those
societies which in any case lacked strong socialist traditions; indeed,
one could imagine much of the style of thought in question, for all its
suspicious­ness of the universal, as no more than a spurious
universalizing of such specific political conditions. **[Such a concern
with bodiliness]{.underline}** and sexuality **[would
represent]{.underline}**, one imagines, an enormous political deepening
and en­richment, at the same time as it would signify [**a thoroughgoing
displace­ment**.]{.underline} And no doubt **[just the same could be said
if one were to witness an increasing obsession with language and
culture---topics where the intellec­tual is in any case more likely to
feel at home than in the realm of material production. One might expect
that some, true to the pessimism of the period, would stress how
discourses are policed, regulated, heavy with power]{.underline}**,
while others would proclaim in more libertarian spirit how the thrills
and spills of the signifier can give the slip to the system. Either way,
**[one would no doubt witness an immense linguistic inflation, as what
appeared no longer con­ceivable in political reality was still just about
possible in the areas of discourse or signs or textuality. The freedom
of text or language would come to compensate for the unfreedom of the
system as a whole. There would still be a kind of utopian vision, but
its name now would be increasingly poetry.]{.underline}** And it would
even be possible to imagine, in an "extremist" variant of this style of
thought, that the future was here and now---that utopia had already
arrived in the shape of the pleasurable intensities, multiple selfhoods,
and exhilarating exchanges of the marketplace and the shopping mall.
[**History would then most certainly have come to an end---an end
already implicit in the blocking of radical political action. For if no
such collective action seemed generally possible, then history would
indeed appear as random and directionless, and to claim that there was
no longer any "grand narra­tive" would be, among other things, a way of
saying that we no longer knew how to construct one effectively in these
conditions.**]{.underline} For this kind of thought, history would have
ended because freedom would finally have been achieved; for Marxism, the
achievement of freedom would be the *beginning* of history and the end
of all we have known to date: those boring prehisto- rical grand
narratives which are really just the same old recycled story of
scarcity, suffering, and struggle. (17-22)

### Drone Policing Link

#### Drone policing is not an isolated or disconnected action of power but is a construction of capitalist control over subjectivity -- socities of control rely on data driven isolation to produce docile economic subjects -- attention to the way structures produce subjectivity is a pre-requsiite for revolutionary change.

**Morris '14** (Adam, PhD candidate in Spanish and Portuguese in the
department of Iberian and Latin American Cultures at Stanford
University, "Whoever, Whatever: On Anonymity as Resistance to Empire"
Parallax, Volume 18, Issue 4)

Charting the demise of hopes once expressed by identity politics is not
my primary objective here, but a summary of what I mean will be useful.
**[As]{.underline}** David **[Harvey has observed, these
movements]{.underline}**, **[based]{.underline}** essentially **[in the
liberal tradition of individual freedom, are not dissonant
with]{.underline}** late or **[neoliberal capitalism.]{.underline}**
'Any political movement that holds individual freedoms to be sacrosanct
is vulnerable to incorporation into the neoliberal fold \[...\]
**[Neoliberal rhetoric]{.underline}**, **[with its foundational emphasis
upon individual freedoms, has the power to split off
libertarianism]{.underline}**, identity politics, multi-culturalism, and
eventually narcissistic consumerism **[from the social forces ranged in
pursuit of social justice through the conquest of state
power.]{.underline}**'2 In other words, **[capitalism has managed to
accommodate resistant political movements organized around identity,
smoothing over historical structural disadvantages by co-opting the
rhetoric of equality.]{.underline}** **[The energies of these movements
have been captured by the 'neoliberalization of culture'
and]{.underline}** have thus **[lost their oppositional
character.]{.underline}**3 Rather than combat and subdue movements for
recognition by minority groups, **[late capitalism deploys 'culture' to
co-opt and commodify resistance, in order to rob it of its revolutionary
potential.]{.underline}** Fredric Jameson has done much to illuminate
this logic of late capitalism, which he satisfyingly describes as the
'consumption of sheer commodification as a process'.4 Jameson and others
have diligently explored the contradictions of late capital in the realm
of images and at the level of the commodity. **[What interests
me]{.underline}** here **[are]{.underline}** isomorphic processes of
**[co-optation at the level of identity]{.underline}** -- itself
increasingly regarded and treated as a commodity -- **[and resistance to
these processes of appropriation.]{.underline}** **[The person in
contemporary information economies increasingly functions as a conduit
to wealth.]{.underline}** The person is a mine of data. **[And this mine
is not, like those of fossilized minerals, depleting or
finite.]{.underline}** **[As information, personal data transcends the
renewable/unrenewable dichotomy that is generally used to categorize
resources.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[the data clusters surrounding
people have only become richer sources of profit: technologies,
especially those interlaced with social phenomena]{.underline}** such as
online social networks, **[have created increasingly vast mines of data
as the information clusters surrounding the person grow more and more
robust.]{.underline}** Crucial to its methods of control, **[data
technologies have essentially determined the character of
Empire.]{.underline}** Although their work is dissonant -- namely with
respect to their views on the type and nature of the 'weapons' required
to challenge Imperial control -- recent work by Giorgio Agamben, Michael
Hardt and Antonio Negri and French collective Tiqqun will be the most
useful bridge between critiques of 'postmodern' or 'late' capitalism
made by Harvey and Jameson and the considerations of identity and the
relationship of the person to Imperial capital that stem from
poststructuralist strands of critical theory.5 **[At the level of the
subject and its relationship to Empire]{.underline}**, for example,
**[Tiqqun refer to the late-capitalist world order as a 'regime of
pan-inclusion']{.underline}**6 **[effected by the Law under Empire, an
'omnivorous immanentization' whose objective is to 'make the world into
continuous biopolitical tissue'.]{.underline}**7 This is not far afield
from Hardt and Negri\'s description of Empire as 'an open mouth with an
infinite appetite, inviting all to come peacefully into its domain'.8
And so, despite the admitted differences between their works -- and
these are fundamental disagreements, such as Tiqqun\'s accusation that
Hardt and Negri\'s embrace of the multitude is ultimately an expression
of cynicism -- there is enough assonance in their characterizations of
Empire to make use of them both productively while remembering crucial
distinctions. Returning to identity: **[the increased use of data
analysis has been embraced by two parallel forces: marketing and
surveillance.]{.underline}** These are convenient lay terms for what
Tiqqun understands as **[the 'sub-institutional
practices']{.underline}**9 **[that underwrite the state\'s control of
its population: 'publicity' and 'police']{.underline}**, or as they
define them, '**[the two agencies through which the liberal State gives
transparency to the fundamental opacity of the
population'.]{.underline}**10 **[Empire]{.underline}**, Tiqqun argue,
**[accepts the impossibility of the modern state, but appropriates its
techniques and apparatuses, allowing the State to live on 'as pure
appearance'.]{.underline}**11 **['By connecting them to each other in
view of the war effort, and in a manner largely independent of national
States, these subinstitutional practices give birth to the two
super-institutional poles of Empire: the police becomes Biopower, and
publicity is transformed into the Spectacle'.]{.underline}**12 These
concepts gesture toward the Foucauldian and Situationist roots of
Tiqqun\'s writings. Tiqqun\'s two poles of Empire are worth considering
separately for their specific relations to personal identity. First, the
police. **[Police activity and military operations]{.underline}**, as
Hardt and Negri argue, **[are becoming 'virtually
indistinguishable'.]{.underline}**13 For evidence of this claim, one
need not look further than the paramilitary gear used by police when
confronting protesters in Zuccotti Park or in downtown Oakland and
compare them to those used by squads of US troops in Kabul or Baghdad.
**[While the militarization of the American police is not so
new]{.underline}** -- as Al Baker observed in the New York Times, these
tactics were first justified through the War on Drugs -- **[the War on
Terror has undoubtedly accelerated the process.]{.underline}**14
**[Militarization is not limited to tanks and guns. It sometimes prefers
more subtle forms of violence and control. Intelligence and surveillance
apparatuses provide the most salient example.]{.underline}** Take **[the
government of Afghanistan]{.underline}**, which **[responds to American
carrot-and-stick diplomacy by volunteering its population for a dry run
on large-scale bioinformatics schemes.]{.underline}** There, **[a
government that already fingerprints and photographs everyone passing
through the Kabul airport has now announced plans to create a
fingerprint, photograph and iris-scan of every single one of its
citizens.]{.underline}** **[This program is at least partially funded by
the United States]{.underline}**, and Afghanistan shares its data with
US intelligence agencies.15 American companies developing these
technologies, such as Florida\'s Cross Match Technologies ('The
Worldwide Standard in Biometric Identity Solutions'), which designed the
SEEK II wireless device 'designed for wireless mobile iris, facial and
fingerprint data capture' claim their products are in 'in use
worldwide'.16 Indeed, given that the SEEK II is one of the wireless ID
devices used by Special Operations Forces, it has been speculated that
this was the device used to identify Osama bin Laden at the compound in
Pakistan where he was killed.17 It should also be noted that the
identities of the American killers of Osama bin Laden are protected by
US intelligence.18 **[Cross Match and similar biotech companies stand to
gain by the expansion of these programs to other contexts, including
domestic and peacetime 'security' initiatives.]{.underline}** In fact,
Cross Match did not fail to capitalize on its alleged assistance in the
bin Laden assassination, announcing deals with the Argentine government,
US Department of Defence and Palm Beach Gardens Police Department in the
months following the Pakistan raid.19 The Palm Beach Police deal in
particular legitimates Hardt and Negri\'s claim that **[these data
gathering tactics are not limited to lands identified as war zones or
terrorist hotbeds.]{.underline}**20 **['The domestic face of just-war
doctrines and the war against terrorism']{.underline}**, Hardt and Negri
write, '**[is a regime aimed at near complete social
control]{.underline}** \[...\] **[a society whose diminishing civil
liberties and increasing rates of incarceration are in certain respects
a manifestation of a constant social war'.]{.underline}**21 Despite
Tiqqun\'s criticisms of 'Negriism' as 'the ridiculous hope for a global
democratic state', they are in agreement on this point.22 **[What
biometrics and the 'warfare state' are attempting with both foreign and
domestic police forces is to give 'transparency to the fundamental
opacity of the population': an impersonal knowing that characterizes the
progression from disciplinary societies to societies of control. The
second State agency of population transparency]{.underline}** named by
Tiqqun **[is publicity.]{.underline}** **[If the police are the flexed
skeletal muscle of Empire, then publicity is the smooth digestive muscle
of Imperial force. It requires far less direction from any institutional
command centre and functions continuously]{.underline}** and more or
less on its own **[for as long as the capitalist organism is
alive.]{.underline}** It is no less interested than the police in
controlling the population, but its methods are often less direct.
**[There are]{.underline}**, however, **[some instances in which the
tactics and technologies of police and publicity as
congruent;]{.underline}** the **[face-recognition]{.underline}** feature
added to Facebook **[is one]{.underline}** such
**[example.]{.underline}** Credit scoring, or what Josh Lauer calls the
'mass surveillance' of 'financial identity' could also be considered a
hybrid practice located somewhere between the poles of publicity and
police, Spectacle and Biopower.23 Much of Tiqqun\'s understanding of
publicity derives from Deleuze and Debord, particularly Deleuze\'s
characterization of control society as one in which the corporation has
taken over for the old Foucauldian disciplinary institutions. **[In a
globally interconnected society ruled by multinational corporations -- a
state of affairs increasingly disinterested in concealing itself -- the
corporate style of management and control has become ubiquitous, and
control apparatuses have become enmeshed in entertainment and leisure in
addition to industry and government.]{.underline}** **['Marketing has
become the centre]{.underline}** or the "soul" **[of the
corporation']{.underline}**, Deleuze writes.24 **[Indeed, Google,
Facebook and their ilk make no secret of the fortunes they make through
data mining. 'Individuals']{.underline}**, Deleuze observes, '**[have
become "dividuals"]{.underline}**, and masses, samples\' data, markets
or "banks"'.25 **[Dividuals have attributes that are of interest to the
corporation and to the biopolitical police force, but their identity is
not usually of concern unless a threat is discerned.]{.underline}** Or
as media theorist Alexander Galloway has put it, in most cases 'the
clustering of descriptive information around a specific user becomes
sufficient to explain the identity of that user'.26 **[Corporations sell
this data for marketing purposes based on 'selects' that allow them to
stratify data clusters. But the value of what is being bought and sold
originates in the activities or identity of individual
people.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[raw data is increasingly produced on
a volunteer basis by consumers themselves.]{.underline}** Media
theorists describe an 'attention economy' in which we labour almost
constantly, even as leisure. As Jonathan Beller writes, 'cinema and its
succeeding (if still simultaneous) formations, particularly television,
video, computers, and the internet, are deterritorialized factories in
which spectators work, that is, in which we perform value-productive
labour'.27 The mantra of his text is 'to look is to labour', that is,
the attention we bestow on an image accretes value onto it. This
attention economy is the basis for the wealth of marketing firms. And
the ingenuity of these businesses lies in the fact that much of the
labour that goes into the value of the services they sell is performed
for free. The labourers remain disperse, deterritorialized, anonymous.

### False Consciousness Link

#### Capitalist Antagonisms structure concrete material reality, the 1ac's discussion is false consciousness in order to distract from an analysis of totality---this totality is critical to creating a pedagogy from within debate that can transform society

**Zavarzadeh 2003** (Ma'sud, professor at Syracuse, "The Pedagogy of
Totality," *Red Critique*, Fall/Winter,
<http://www.redcritique.org/FallWinter2003/> thepedagogyoftotality.htm)

To put \"class\" back into teaching of the \"event\" is to move beyond
dissipating history through \"trauma\" and anecdotes of affect and thus
put an end to the teaching of savviness, which masquerades as a curing
of ignorance. **[The task of the pedagogy of totality is to teach the
abstract relations that structure the concrete material reality and not
be distracted]{.underline}** by the details of appearance because
\"**[abstractions]{.underline}** reflect nature more deeply, truly and
completely\" **[and bring the student closer to grasping social
totality]{.underline}**: \"the relations of production in their
totality\" (Marx, Wage-Labour and Capital, 29), **[which is constituted
by class antagonism,]{.underline}** and therefore its unity is a \"unity
of opposites\" (Lenin, \"On the Question of Dialectics\", 358). **[The
hostility to conceptual analysis and particularly to class critique in
contemporary pedagogy]{.underline}** goes well beyond the teach-ins on
the \"event\". It **[is the fundamental dogma of \"radical\" bourgeois
pedagogy.]{.underline}** Henry Giroux, for example, wipes out class from
pedagogy on the grounds that \"class\" is part of what he calls
\"totalizing\" politics (Impure Acts 25-26). **[To be]{.underline}** so
totally **[opposed to totalizing is,]{.underline}** of course, **[itself
a totalization.]{.underline}** But totalizing in opposing totalization
does not seem to bother Giroux and other anti-totalizing pedagogues
because the issue, ultimately, is really not epistemological
(\"totalizing\") but economic (class). **[In contemporary pedagogy
\"totalizing\" is an epistemological cover for the class cleansing of
pedagogy.]{.underline}** \[...\] **[Pedagogy is most effective when its
lessons are situated in the conceptual analysis of objective social
totality and grounded in historical materialist critique. Totalization
is essential to transformative pedagogy because it is through
totalization that the student---the future worker---is enabled to \"see
society]{.underline}** from the center, **[as a coherent whole\" and
therefore \"act in such a way as to change reality\"]{.underline}**
(Lukacs, History and Class Consciousness, 69). **[Changing reality in a
sustained way, requires knowing it]{.underline}** historically and
objectively, that is, **[conceptually as a totality in structure and not
simply reacting to it as a galaxy of signifiers]{.underline}** (as
textualists have done); **[as the working of power in networks of
discourses]{.underline}** (Foucault), **[or as a spontaneous
reality]{.underline}** that is available to us in its full immediacy (as
activists have done with eclecticism and sentimentality).
**[Pedagogy]{.underline}**, in other words, **[is always partisan and
the only question is whose side]{.underline}** (in the great class
struggles) **[it takes and why]{.underline}**: \"Who does not know that
talk about this or that institution being non-partisan is generally
nothing but the humbug of the ruling classes, who want to gloss over the
fact that existing institutions are already imbued, in ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred, with a very definite political spirit?\" (Lenin, \"The
Tasks of the Revolutionary Youth\"). **[Criticism of totality as a
closural space that excludes \"difference\" and thus leads to
\"totalitarianism\" is based on an anti-materialist reading of
difference as \"contingency\"]{.underline}** (Richard Rorty,
Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 3-69); as
\"**[hybridity]{.underline}**\" (Homi Bhabha, The Location of Culture);
as \"differance\"---the play of \"traces\" in the differing and deferral
of the sign (Derrida, \"Differance\"); **[or the performativity of
identity]{.underline}** (Judith Butler, Bodies That Matter: On the
Discursive Limits of \"Sex\"). **[These]{.underline}** and other
versions of difference (Anthony Giddens, Runaway World: How
Globalization is Reshaping Our Lives) in contemporary pedagogy, **[are
based on cultural heterogeneities that deflect the difference that makes
all the differences: the social division of labor under capitalism. The
pedagogy of totality writes the foundational difference of class, which
explains all these differences, back into teaching and foregrounds
it]{.underline}** not as aleatory signs (which is the epistemology of
all these differences) but **[as a historical necessity for capital,
which divides people with rigid clarity in the regime of wage
labor]{.underline}** (Marx and Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party,
40-60). Social totality, as I have suggested, is a totality with a
materialist (class) difference. It is a resistance against the ferocity
of \"contingency\", \"performativity\", \"hybridity\", and
\"differance\" which, with the spiritual aroma of religion, have
re-written the world in cynicism, in pathos, and ironically but always
in the interest of the transnational bourgeoisie. \[...\] **[A pedagogy
that understand class]{.underline}**---as an objectivity---**[will be
able to contribute to its transformation. Without teaching for ending
class,]{.underline}** which is possible only through understanding it as
objective, **[all acts of pedagogy become acts of cultural adjustment to
the dominant social conditions---acts of learning \"how power
works\"]{.underline}** (Giroux, Impure Acts, 139) **[in order to
manipulate it and make it work for them.]{.underline}** Giroux calls the
arts and crafts of manipulating power, \"critical pedagogy\" and call
its manipulators \"**[critical citizens]{.underline}**\". This
**[is]{.underline}** a citizenry, however, that is **[always concerned
with how power works on \"them\", through \"them\" and for \"them\" (not
the collective). It is obsessed with \"power\" and never concerned with
\"exploitation\". It is]{.underline}**, in **[the language of bourgeois
stratification, an \"upper middle class\" citizenry for whom the
question of poverty (exploitation) is non-existent, and the only
question is the question of personal liberty (power),]{.underline}** as
Giroux makes even more clear in his stories in Breaking into the Movies:
Film and the Culture of Politics; Public Spaces, Private Lives.

### Family Link

#### Focus on the family is too narrow - leads to depoliticization 

Dean 14 \[Jodi, Professor of Humanities and Social Sciences at Hobart
and William Smith Colleges, Book review, book by Kennan Ferguson, Prof @
U Wisconsin-Milwaukee, pub. Duke: Durham, NC (2012), "All in the family:
On community and incommensurability," Contemporary Political Theory
(2014) 13, 307--316, 20 May 2014\]

With respect to the family, Kennan convincingly argues that a notion of
the family underpins liberal and communitarian ideas of politics. He
demonstrates how this notion denies the tensions and problems that make
the family a scene of conflict rather than an ideal unity. **[But I am
not convinced by his further argument that the family is the most
important and significant site of most people's political
engagements]{.underline}**, **[far more important to any of our
commitments to political abstractions. Ferguson makes this point when he
says]{.underline}**:\"**[For]{.underline}** most of us, **[even the most
politically committed]{.underline}** or religiously observant,
**[questions of how to make a living or how to promote a just society
fade into the background in comparison to our relationships to our loved
ones]{.underline}**, our attempts to negotiate closeness to and distance
from our lovers, our parents, our children. (p. 25)\" And\"**[We care
far more about those close to us than we do about those who can change
the world at large]{.underline}**. (p. 26)\" And\"The negotiations
between a parent and a teenager over curfews, bedtimes, and familial
responsibilities are far more fraught, far more important, than more
grandiose and distant abstract ethical questions. (p. 31)\" **[I think
all these points are descriptively wrong]{.underline}**. **[First, they
push economic and social concerns outside the family, as if the work we
do to make a living or promote a just society was separate from the
family rather than part of it.]{.underline}** This pushing is connected
to a striking omission in Ferguson's description of the family, the
family as a site for the reproduction of labor, privilege and hierarchy.
Instead, the family in his treatment is a site 'we are all implicated in
in diverse and pluralized ways'. But the family is an institution
encoded in law, custom and religion; **[families are]{.underline}**
thereby **[restricted in variety and organization. The family is a site
through which these restrictions are maintained.]{.underline}**
Normatively, Ferguson might think that families should be sites of
infinite variety -- but this is not the case in practice. Second, the
point regarding what people care about makes more sense as a claim
regarding what people think they can affect. **[As the grip of
capitalism has tightened, and the power of unions and an organized left
diminished]{.underline}**, **[many have come to think that they cannot
make a difference, cannot change the world]{.underline}**. **[All they
can do is work on themselves]{.underline}**, which is the dominant
message they get from capitalist media. Third, how can a statement
regarding what is more or less important -- say, curfews for teenagers
versus human responsibility for climate change -- be made at such a
level of generality? What would count as evidence or an argument for it?
And even if it were true and something like 87 per cent of people
thought this, what is the implication? I would say that **[the
implication is one of severe depoliticization]{.underline}**, **[a
depoliticization such that one cannot get out of one's own isolated
experience and recognize collective and common issues.]{.underline}**
Differently put, **[these claims]{.underline}** Ferguson makes for the
family **[suggest a political world closing in on itself, one reduced to
the personal and momentary rather than approached through
it.]{.underline}**

### Gender as difference/discourse Link

#### Postmodern approaches to gender fixate on discursive approaches which denies the materiality that sutures racialized structures of gender -- historical critique of the social totality is key

**Ebert '93 (**Teresa, Professor @ SUNY Albany, "Ludic Feminism, the
Body, Performance, and Labor: Bringing \"Materialism\" Back into
Feminist Cultural Studies", Cultural Critique, No. 23**)**

Instead of an interventionist critique, (ludic**[) postmodern cultural
studies tends to focus on pleasure-pleasure in/of textuality, the local,
the popular, and, above all, the body (jouissance)-]{.underline}**as8
Teresa L. Ebert in and of itself-a form of resistance. This is a \"new
generation\" of intellectuals, according to Andrew Ross, who \"appeal to
the liberatory body, and the creativity of consumption\" (11). Thus,
**[postmodern feminist cultural critics like Constance Penley in-
creasingly engage not in critique but in affirmative descriptions of
local sites of pleasure]{.underline}**. For instance, in Penley\'s
popular studies of a genre of Star Trek fan magazines (called \"slash
zines\" because they eroticize and sexualize the relationship between
Kirk and they eroticize and sexualize the relationship between Kirk and
Spock and are designated by a code with a slash, \"K/S\") her \"aim\"
Spock and are designated by a code with a slash, \"K/S\") her \"aim\" is
to \"show\" the \"range and diversity of identifications and object
relations\" in these texts because \"once shown, it will then be pos-
sible to give a fuller and more complex account of what women do with
popular culture, how it gives them pleasure, and how it can be
consciously and unconsciously reworked to give them more pleasure\"
(\"Feminism\" 488). **[Ludic feminist cultural studies, in other words,
seeks to \"show\" or \"give . . . account,\" that is, to describe but
not to explain through conceptualization, for any at- tempt to
\"conceptualize\" experience or pleasure is seen by ludic critics as a
violent erasure of the unique, local, specific, and con- crete
individual: to conceptualize is to totalize and to totalize is seen, at
all levels, as totalitarian. But such a validating, affirmative, and
pleasure-ful culture studies-concerned primarily with the liberation of
(individual) desire]{.underline}** and the body as zone of
sensuousness-**[is]{.underline}** to my mind **[a very class-specific
inquiry. Pleasure and desire can be the over- riding concern only for
the classes of people (middle and upper) who are already \"free\" from
economic want]{.underline}** and have the means to pursue or, more
specifically in commodity cultures, to consume the means for pleasure.
It is also **[these classes who have the relative luxury of displacing
the body as means of labor onto the body as pleasure zone. This
fetishization of pleasure validates the priorities and privileges of the
middle class]{.underline}**-in spite of its attention to the
\"pleasures\" of others-for **[it produces a cultural stud- ies that
largely erases the needs, conditions, and exploitation of the working
poor and the impoverished underclass in this country and
globally]{.underline}**: an underclass that is denied basic economic and
human rights, **[an underclass that is overwhelmingly not \"white.\"5
This ludic valorization of \"pleasure\" as liberation,]{.underline}**
the affirmation of existing social differences, and the fetishization of
the local\" and specific raise serious problems for feminist and oppo-
sitional culture critique. It **[will not take us far in understanding
or explaining the socioeconomic conditions and desperation under- lying
the uprising in Los Angeles or causing women in India to sell their
kidneys and women in the United States to rent out their
uteruses]{.underline}** in order to feed their children**[; nor will it
help us much to intervene in and change these conditions]{.underline}**.
**[The verdict in the Rodney King trial-for many of us-was not a local,
contingent, arbitrary, and aleatory play of power; rather, it was part
of the systematic exercise of inequality, injustice, and oppression
against African Americans in this countr]{.underline}**y. It urgently
impresses on us the need not simply to \"account for and validate social
differences\" but to critique them in order to explain the underlying
social re- lations of exploitation and to transform them. Perhaps I need
to clarify here what I mean by critique. First, I do not regard
\"critique\" as an end in itself. **[Critique is a practice through
which the subject develops historical knowledge of the social totality:
she or he acquires, in other words, an understand- ing of how the
existing social institutions]{.underline}** (\"motherhood,\" \"child
care,\" \"love,\" \"paternity,\" \"taxation,\" \"family,\" etc.) **[have
in fact come about and how they can be changed.]{.underline}** Critique,
in other words, is **[that knowledge-practice that historically situates
the con- ditions of possibility of what empirically exists under
patriarchal- capitalist labor relations and, more importantly, points to
what is suppressed by the empirically existing:]{.underline}** what
could be (instead of what actually is). Critique indicates, in other
words, that what \"is\" is not necessarily the real/true but rather only
the existing actu- ality which is transformable. **[The role of critique
in resistance postmodern feminism is exactly this: the production of
historical knowledges that mark the transformability of existing social
ar- rangements and the possibility of a different social organization-
an organization free from exploitation]{.underline}**. Quite simply
then, cri- tique is a mode of knowing that inquires into what is not
said, into the silences and the suppressed or missing, in order to
uncover the concealed operations of power and underlying socioeconomic
relations connecting the myriad details and seemingly disparate events
and representations of our lives. It shows how seemingly disconnected
zones of culture are in fact linked through the highly differentiated
and dispersed operation of a systematic logic10 Teresa L. Ebert of
exploitation informing all practices of society. In sum, critique
disrupts that which represents itself as what is, as natural, as in-
evitable, as the way things are and exposes the way \"what is\" is
historically and socially produced out of social contradictions and how
it supports inequality. **[Critique enables us to explain how gender,
race, sexual, and class oppression operate so we can change it. A number
of contemporary feminists, from Haraway and Penley to Jane Gallop and
Judith Butler, have embraced the ludic mode of postmodern cultural
studies and argued for its liberatory potentia]{.underline}**l. But I
believe if feminists are to engage in postmodern cultural studies
without jeopardizing feminism\'s political effec- tiveness, **[we need
to rigorously critique postmodernism\'s funda- mental presuppositions
and, above all, to write a materialist pol- itics back into
postmodernism.]{.underline}** My essay is a contribution to this effort.
Thus it insists on a transformative emancipatory politics in
postmodernism and on the necessity of critique for an opposi- tional
culture studies. In other words, I contend that **[the ludic postmodern
erasure of the political in the name of discursive dif- ference is only
one way of constructing postmodern difference]{.underline}**. In
contrast, I want to argue for feminism to radically retheorize post-
modern difference itself and to articulate what I call a resistance
postmodernism that will be the basis for postmodern materialist feminist
culture critique.

### Gender/Sexuality Link

#### Materialism is key -- only a historical analysis of labour relations can recognize the invisiblizes violence of millions of women around the world directly structure by capitalist accumulation.

**Ebert '93 (**Teresa, Professor @ SUNY Albany, "Ludic Feminism, the
Body, Performance, and Labor: Bringing \"Materialism\" Back into
Feminist Cultural Studies", Cultural Critique, No. 23**)**

**[Gender and sexuality are not simply the result of discursive or
signifying practices performed on the body but also, and more
importantly, they are the effect of labor performed by, on, and through
bodies as historically determined by the division of labor and the
unequal access to economic and social resources]{.underline}**. The way
we live in/through our bodies as men and women, the way our bodies take
shape, the way we make sense of and signify our bodies, and even the way
we desire and are pleasured in and through our bodies are all affected
by our participation in gen-der-divided labor relations-especially those
of racist patriarchal capitalism, whose scope now reaches around the
globe. By labor I do not mean only work for paid wages or work for the
production of surplus value and commodities-although it is particularly
important to stress the ever-increasing involvement of women in all
classes, races, and even nations in the production of surplus value and
feminization of more and more sectors of commodity production as in
\"light-assembly work, whether . .. Barbie dolls or computer
components,\" textiles, and, especially important in the
\"underdeveloped countries,\" such as Thailand, \"sex-tourism.\"19 But
also, more broadly**[, I mean labor as the hu-man activity of
transforming nature involved in the reproduction of human life itself as
well as the basic means to sustain that life: the production of use
values, that is, products for the direct use and survival of the
producer and not for commodity exchange, such as food, clothing, and
care giving-areas of work that are overwhelmingly the province of women
in the gendered division of labor.]{.underline}** This retheorization
and expansion of the classic Marxist notion of productive labor is what
the \"German School\" of materialist feminist theorists-Maria Mies,
Claudia von Werlhof, and Veronika Bennholdt-Thomsen-have called
\"production of life or subsistence production.\"20 For instance, Mies
argues that \"women\'s activity in producing children and milk is
understood as truly human, that is, conscious, social activity\"-not
nature or natural activity-and \"has to be understood as a result of the
patriarchal and capitalist division of labor and not as its
precondition\" (Pa-triarchy and Accumulation 53-54). **[To address the
issue of labor in the production of body, gender, sexuality, then, means
to criti-cally engage the body as both a means of productive labor and
itself a site acted on by labor. It opens up the possibility of social
struggle over the way the specificities of gender and women\'s bodies
are shaped, used, and exploited by specific historical forms of the
division of labor on the basis of ideologically constructed gender
differences]{.underline}**. **[To articulate the unsaid issue of labor
in the production of gender questions the usefulness of ludic theories
of gender and culture based on a discursive excess, semiotic activism,
pleasure, and performance]{.underline}**. Will such ludic theories help
feminists formu-late a historical explanation so that we can develop
collective social struggles against the economic exploitation and
suffering of women globally-particularly women of color and women in
un-derdeveloped areas in the United States and Europe, and in Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere forced by eco-nomic necessity into
severely underpaid \"women\'s work\" or op-pressive forms of unpaid
domestic work? **[Will they help us un-derstand and prevent the \"100
million disappeared women\"-the global neglect, starving, and killing of
girl children and embryos]{.underline}** (Kristof C1, C12)-**[as well as
the physical and sexual abuse and economic impoverishment of many of the
world\'s women because of their devalued socioeconomic position in
patriarchy? For ludic postmodern feminist theory and cultural studies to
fetishize plea-sure, desire, and individual libidinal and gender freedom
by sim-ply rhetorically displacing-even erasing-the oppressive gender
constraints and economic exploitation of patriarchal capitalism is an
instance of middle-class myopia]{.underline}**, to say the least, which
\"uni-versalizes\" the privileges and relative individual freedoms of
the few. (Is it necessary to remind ourselves that nearly all the
femi-nists engaged in debates over theory and cultural studies,
regard-less of race or nationality, are \[upper\] middle-class
professionals, largely, although not entirely, from North America,
Europe, and Australia, and thus part of a minority of the world
appropriating the majority of the world\'s resources and surplus value?)
It is not a question of doing away with pleasure, but how do we
understand the global relations of pleasure, and make sense of the
connections among the liberatory gestures, privileges, and freedoms of
the few and the oppression of the many? What is the cost of bourgeois,
Eurocentric ludic theories of liberation to all the women (and men)
globally in need of radical social emanci-pation? Yes it is bread we
fight for \... but we fight for roses too\.... No more the drudge and
idler-ten that toil where one reposes, But a sharing of life\'s glories:
Bread and Roses! Bread and Roses!21 **[As a first step to developing the
theories that can effectively understand and intervene in such social
conditions, I believe a resistance postmodern feminist culture studies
needs to engage a materialist retheorization of differences as
differences-in-relation-to-socioeconomic-systems-of-exploitation and
specifically to radi-cally critique cultural practices and
significations in connection with the gendered division of labor,
particularly in terms of the current global reconfiguration of
patriarchal capitalism.]{.underline}**

### Infoshop Link

#### The 1ac is just an infoshop---an organization where radicals meet to discuss ideals in the abstract---this disconnection from society precludes any possibility or revolutionary change. True politics must occur at a level of class consciousness and organizing, they just recreate new elitism and maintain the status quo.

**Olson 2013 (**Joel, associate professor at Northern Arizona
University, "The problem with infoshops and insurrection US anarchism,
movement building, and the racial order", 'Contemporary Anarchist
Studies', published in 2013**)**

**[An infoshop is a space where people can learn about radical ideas,
where radicals can meet other radicals, and where political
work]{.underline}** (such as meetings, public forums, fundraisers, etc.)
**[can get done]{.underline}**. In the infoshop strategy, infoshops and
other "**[autonomous zones" model the free society]{.underline}** (Bey
1985). **[Building "free spaces" inspires others to spontaneously create
their own, spreading "counterinstitutions]{.underline}**" throughout
society to the point where they become so numerous that they overwhelm
the powers that be. Th**[e very creation of anarchist free spaces has
revolutionary implications]{.underline}**, then, because it can lead to
the "organic" (i.e. spontaneous, undirected, nonhierarchical)
**[spreading of such spaces throughout society in a way that eventually
challenges the state]{.underline}**. An insurrection, meanwhile, is the
armed uprising of the people. **[According to the insurrection strategy,
anarchists acting in affinity groups or other small informal
organizations engage in actions that encourage spontaneous uprisings in
various sectors of society]{.underline}**. As localized insurrections
grow and spread, **[they combine into a full-scale revolution that
overthrows the state and capital and makes possible the creation of a
free society]{.underline}**.3 **[Infoshops serve very important
functions and any movement needs such spaces]{.underline}**. Likewise,
insurrection is a central event in any revolution, for it turns the
patient organizing of the movement and the boiling anger of the people
into an explosive confrontation with the state. **[The problem is when
infoshops and insurrection are seen as revolutionary strategies in
themselves rather than as part of a broader revolutionary
movement]{.underline}**. In the infoshop model, **[autonomous spaces
become the movement for radical change rather than serving it. The
insurrection model tries to replace movement building with spontaneous
upheaval rather than seeing upheaval as an outcome of social
movements.]{.underline}** The **[infoshops and
insurrection]{.underline}** models, in other words, **[both
misunderstand the process of social transformation]{.underline}**.
**[Radical change may be initiated by spontaneous revolts that are
supported by subterranean free spaces]{.underline}**, but **[these
revolts are almost always the product of prior political movement
building]{.underline}**, and **[their gains must be consolidated by
political organizations, not the spaces such organizations use. Social
movements, then, are central to radical change]{.underline}**. The
classical anarchists understood this well, for they were very concerned
to build working-class movements, such as Bakunin's participation in the
International Working Men's Association, Berkman and Goldman's support
for striking workers, Lucy Parson's work in the International Working
People's Association, and the Wobblies' call for "One Big Union." (To be
sure, there were also practices of building free spaces and engaging in
"propaganda by the deed" in classical anarchism, but these were not the
sole or even dominant approaches.) **[Yet surprisingly much of the
contemporary anarchist milieu has abandoned movement
building.]{.underline}** In fact, the **[infoshops and insurrection
models both seem to be designed, at least in part, to avoid the slow,
difficult, but absolutely necessary work of building mass
movements]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[anarchist
publications]{.underline}** like Green Anarchy **[are explicit about
this]{.underline}**, **[deriding movement building as inherently
authoritarian]{.underline}** (for example Morefus n.d.). The anarchist
emphasis on hierarchy contributes to this impatience with movement
building because **[the kind of political work it encourages are
occasional protests or "actions" against myriad forms of domination
rather than sustained organizing based on a coherent strategy to win
political space in a protracted struggle. A revolution is not an
infoshop, or an insurrection, or creating a temporary autonomous zone,
or engaging in sabotage]{.underline}**; **[it cannot be so easy, so
evolutionary, so "organic," so absent of difficult political
struggle]{.underline}**. A **[revolution is an actual historical event
whereby one class overthrows another]{.underline}** and -- in the
anarchist ideal -- **[thereby makes it possible to abolish all forms of
oppression]{.underline}**. Such **[revolutions are the product of mass
movements: a large group of people organized in struggle against the
state and/or other institutions of power to achieve their
demands.]{.underline}** When movements become powerful enough, when they
sufficiently weaken elites, and when fortune is on their side, they lead
to an insurrection, and then perhaps a revolution. Yet in much of the
anarchist milieu today, **[building free spaces and/or creating disorder
are regarded as the movement itself rather than components of
one]{.underline}**. **[Neither the infoshops nor insurrection models
build movements that can express the organized power of the working
class]{.underline}**. Thus, **[the necessary, difficult, slow, and
inspiring process of building movements falls through the cracks between
sabotage and the autonomous zone]{.underline}**. Ironically, **[this
leads many anarchists to take an elitist approach to political
work]{.underline}**. **[Divorced from a social movement, the strategy of
building autonomous zones or engaging in direct action with small
affinity groups assumes that radicals can start the
revolution]{.underline}**. But **[revolutionaries don't make
revolutions. Millions of ordinary and oppressed people
do.]{.underline}** Anarchist theory and practice today provides little
sense of how these people are going to be part of the process, other
than to create their own "free spaces" or to spontaneously join the
festivals of upheaval. **[This is an idealistic, ahistorical, and,
ironically, an elitist approach to politics, one that is curiously
separated from the struggles of the oppressed themselves.]{.underline}**
C.L.R. James argues that t**[he task of the revolutionary is to
recognize, record, and engage: recognize in the struggles of the working
class the effort to build a new society within the shell of the old;
record those struggles and show the working class this record so they
can see for themselves what they are doing and how it fits into a bigger
picture; engage in these struggles with the working class, participating
rather than dominating, earning leadership rather than assuming it, and
applying lessons learned from previous struggles]{.underline}** (James
et al. 1974).4 **[This is a much more modest role for revolutionaries
than germinating the revolution or sparking]{.underline}** it, and one
that is clearly consistent with anarchist politics. Yet **[the infoshops
and insurrectionary models reject this approach for a top-down one in
which anarchists "show the way" for the people to follow, never
realizing that throughout history, revolutionaries (including anarchist
ones) have always been trying to follow and catch up to the masses, not
the other way around.]{.underline}**

### Interpassivity Link

#### The acceptance of lukewarm critique or discourse as a replacement for actual resistance and movements is interpassivity -- their intellectualism masks an insidious investment in the maintenance of capitalism. 

**Zizek 2 (**Slavoj, professor of philosophy at the Institute for
Sociology, Ljubljana, "Revolution at the Gates", pg 167-172**)**

The problem lies in the further implicit qualifications which can easily
be discerned by a "concrete analysis of the concrete situation", as
Lenin himself would have put it. "Fidelity to the democratic consensus"
means acceptance of the present liberal-parliamentary consensus, which
precludes any serious questioning of the way this liberal-democratic
order is complicit in the phenomena it officially condemns, and, of
course, any serious attempt to imagine a different sociopolitical order.
In short, it means: say and write whatever you like --- on condition
that you do not actually question or disturb the prevailing political
consensus. Everything is allowed, solicited even, as a critical topic:
the prospect of a global ecological catastrophe; violations of human
rights; sexism, homophobia, anti-feminism; growing violence not only in
faraway countries, but also in our own megalopolises; the gap between
the First and the Third World, between rich and poor; the shattering
impact of the digitalization of our daily lives \... today, there is
nothing easier than to get international, state or corporate funds for a
multidisciplinary research project on how to fight new forms of ethnic,
religious or sexist violence. The problem is that all this occurs
against the background of a fundamental Denkverbot: a prohibition on
thinking. Today's liberal-democratic hegemony is sustained by a kind of
unwritten Denkverbot similar to the infamous Berufsverbot (prohibition
on employing individuals with radical Left leanings in the state organs)
in Germany in the late 1960s --- **[the moment we show a minimal sign of
engaging in political projects which aim seriously to challenge the
existing order, the answer is immediately: "Benevolent as it is, this
will inevitably end in a new Gulag!"]{.underline}** The ideological
function of constant references to the Holocaust, the Gulag, and more
recent Third World catastrophes is thus to serve as the support of this
Denkverbot by constantly reminding us how things could have been much
worse: "Just look around and see for yourself what will happen if we
follow your radical notions!" What we encounter here is the ultimate
example of what Anna Dinerstein and Mike Neary have called the project
of disutopia: "not just the temporary absence of Utopia, but the
political celebration of the end of social dreams".2 And the demand for
"scientific objectivity" amounts to just another version of the same
Denkverhot: the moment we seriously question the existing liberal
consensus, we are accused of abandoning scientific objectivity for
outdated ideological positions. This is the "Leninist" point on which
one cannot and should not concede: today**[, actual freedom of thought
means freedom to question the prevailing liberal-democratic
"post-ideological" consensus --- or it means nothing]{.underline}**. The
Right to Truth The perspective of the critique of ideology compels us to
invert Wittgenstein's "What one cannot speak about, thereof one should
be silent" into "What one should not speak about, thereof one cannot
remain silent". If you want to speak about a social system, you cannot
remain silent about its repressed excess. The point is not to tell the
whole Truth but, precisely, to append to the (official) Whole the uneasy
supplement which denounces its falsity. As Max Horkheimer put it back in
the l930s: "If you don't want to talk about capitalism, then you should
keep silent about Fascism." Fascism is the inherent "symptom" (the
return of the repressed) of capitalism, the key to its "truth", not just
an external contingent deviation of its "normal" logic. And the same
goes for today's situation: those who do not want to subject liberal
democracy and the flaws of its multiculturalist tolerance to critical
analysis, should keep quiet about the new Rightist violence and
intolerance. If we are to leave the opposition between
liberal-democratic universalism and ethnic/religious fundamentalism
behind, the first step is to acknowledge the existence of liberal
fundamentalism: the perverse game of making a big fuss when the rights
of a serial killer or a suspected war criminal are violated, while
ignoring massive violations of "ordinary" people's rights. More
precisely, the politically correct stance betrays its perverse economy
through its oscillation between the two extremes: either fascination
with the victimized other (helpless children, raped women . . .), or a
focus on the problematic other who, although criminal, and so on, also
deserves protection of his human rights, because "today it's him,
tomorrow it'll be us" (an excellent example is Noam Chomsky's defence of
a French book advocating the revisionist stance on the Holocaust). On a
different level, a similar instance of the perversity of Political
Correctness occurs in Denmark, where people speak ironically of the
"white woman's burden", her ethico-political duty to have sex with
immigrant workers from Third World countries --- this being the final
necessary step in ending their exclusion. Today, in the era of what
Habermas designated as die neue Unubersichtlichkeit (the new opacity),\~
our everyday experience is more mystifying than ever: modernization
generates new obscurantisms; the reduction of freedom is presented to us
as the dawn of new freedoms. **[The perception that we live in a society
of free choices]{.underline}**, in which we have to choose even our most
"natural" features (ethnic or sexual identity), **[is the form of
appearance of its very opposite: of the absence of true
choices]{.underline}**. The recent trend for "alternate reality" films,
which present existing reality as one of a multitude of possible
outcomes, is symptomatic of a society in which choices no longer really
matter, are trivialized. The lesson of the time-warp narratives is even
bleaker, since it points towards a total closure: the very attempt to
avoid the predestined course of things not only leads us back to it, but
actually constitutes it --- from Oedipus onwards, we want to avoid A,
and it is through our very detour that A realizes itself. In these
circumstances, **[we should be]{.underline}** especially **[careful not
to confuse the ruling ideology with ideology which seems to
dominate]{.underline}**. More than ever, we should bear in mind Walter
Benjamin's reminder that it is not enough to ask how a certain theory
(or art) positions itself with regard to social struggles --- we ask how
it actually functions in these very struggles. In sex, the true
hegemonic attitude is not patriarchal repression, but free promiscuity;
in art, provocations in the style of the notorious "Sensation"
exhibitions are the norm, the example of art fully integrated into the
establishment. Ayn Rand brought this logic to its conclusion,
supplementing it with a kind of Hegelian twist, that is, reasserting the
official ideology itself as its own greatest transgression, as in the
title of one of her late non-fiction books: "Capitalism, This Unknown
Ideal", or in "top managers, America's last endangered species". Indeed,
since **[the "normal" functioning of capitalism involves some kind of
disavowal of the basic principle of its functioning]{.underline}**
(**[today's model capitalist is someone who, after ruthlessly generating
profit, then generously shares parts of it]{.underline}**, giving large
donations to churches, victims of ethnic or sexual abuse, etc., posing
as a humanitarian), the ultimate act of transgression is to assert this
principle directly, depriving it of its humanitarian mask. I am
therefore tempted to reverse Marx's Thesis 11**[: the]{.underline}**
first **[task today is]{.underline}** precisely **[not to succumb to the
temptation to act]{.underline}**, to intervene directly and change
things (which then inevitably ends in a cul-de-sac of debilitating
impossibility: "What can we do against global capital?"), but to
question the hegemonic ideological co-ordinates. In short, our
historical moment is still that of Adorno: To the question "What should
we do?" I can most often truly answer only with "I don't know." I can
only try to analyse rigorously what there is. Here people reproach me:
When you practise criticism, you are also obliged to say how one should
make it better. To my mind, this is incontrovertibly a bourgeois
preiudice. Many times in history it so happened that the very works
which pursued purely theoretical goals transformed consciousness, and
thereby also social reality. If, today, we follow a direct call to act,
this act will not be performed in an empty space --- it will be an act
within the hegemonic ideological coordinates: those who "really want to
do something to help people" get involved in (undoubtedly honourable)
exploits like Mediecins sans frontieres, Greenpeace, feminist and
anti-racist campaigns, which are all not only tolerated but even
supported by the media, even if they seemingly encroach on economic
territory (for example, denouncing and boycotting companies which do not
respect ecological conditions, or use child labour) --- they are
tolerated and supported as long as they do not get too close to a
certain limit.6 This kind of activity provides the perfect example of
interpassivity:7 of doing things not in order to achieve something, but
to prevent something from really happening, really
changing**[.]{.underline}** All this frenetic humanitarian, Politically
Correct, etc., activity fits the formula of "Let's go on changing
something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same!".
If standard Cultural Studies criticize capitalism, they do so in the
coded way that exemplifies Hollywood liberal paranoia: **[the enemy is
"the system", the hidden "organization", the anti-democratic
"conspiracy", not simply capitalism and state apparatuses. The problem
with this critical stance is not only that it replaces concrete social
analysis with a struggle against abstract paranoiac fantasies,
but]{.underline}** that --- in a typical paranoiac gesture **[--- it
unnecessarily redoubles social reality, as if there were a secret
Organization behind the "visible" capitalist and state
organs]{.underline}**. What we should accept is that there is no need
for a secret "organization-within-an-organization". the "conspiracy" is
already in the "visible" organization as such, in the capitalist system,
in the way the political space and state apparatuses work.8 Let us take
one of the hottest topics in today's "radical" American academia:
postcolonial studies. The problem of postcolonialism is undoubtedly
crucial; however, postcolonial studies tend to translate it into the
multiculturalist problematic of the colonized minorities' "right to
narrate" their victimizing experience, of the power mechanisms which
repress "otherness," so that, at the end of the day, we learn that the
root of postcolonial exploitation is our intolerance towards the Other,
and, furthermore, that this intolerance itself is rooted in our
intolerance towards the "Stranger in Ourselves", in our inability to
confront what we have repressed in and of ourselves --- the
politico-economic struggle is thus imperceptibly transformed into a
pseudopsychoanalytic drama of the subject unable to confront its inner
traumas. . . . (Why pseudo-psychoanalytic? Because the true lesson of
psychoanalysis is not that the external events which fascinate and/or
disturb us are just projections of our inner repressed impulses. The
unbearable fact of life is that there really are disturbing events out
there: there are other human beings who experience intense sexual
enjoyment while we are half-impotent; there are people submitted to
terrifying torture.. . . Again, the ultimate truth of psychoanalysis is
not that of discovering our true Self, but that of the traumatic
encounter with an unbearable Real.) The true corruption of American
academia is not primarily financial, it is not only that universities
are able to buy many European critical intellectuals (myself included
--- up to a point), but conceptual: **[notions of "European" critical
theory are imperceptibly translated into the benign universe of Cultural
Studies chic.]{.underline}** At a certain point, this chic becomes
indistinguishable from the famous Citibank commercial in which scenes of
East Asian, European, Black and American children playing is accompanied
by the voice-over: "People who were once divided by a continent \... are
now united by an economy" --- at this concluding highpoint, of course,
the children are replaced by the Citibank logo. **[The great majority of
today's "radical" academics silently count on the long-term stability of
the American capitalist model]{.underline}**, with a secure tenured
position as their ultimate professional goal (a surprising number of
them even play the stock market). **[If there is one thing they are
genuinely afraid of, it is a radical shattering of the]{.underline}**
(relatively) **[safe life-environment of the "symbolic classes" in
developed Western societies.]{.underline}** Their excessive Politically
Correct zeal when they are dealing with sexism, racism, Third World
sweatshops, and so on, is thus ultimately a defence against their own
innermost identification, a kind of compulsive ritual whose hidden logic
is: "Let's talk as much as possible about the necessity of a radical
change, to make sure that nothing will really change!" The journal
October is typical of this: when you ask one of the editors what the
title refers to, they half-confidentially indicate that it is, of
course, that October --- in this way, you can indulge in jargonistic
analyses of modern art, with the secret assurance that you are somehow
retaining a link with the radical revolutionary past.. . . With regard
to this radical chic, our first gesture towards Third Way ideologists
and practitioners should be one of praise: at least they play their game
straight, and are honest in their acceptance of the global capitalist
co-ordinates --- unlike pseudo-radical academic Leftists who adopt an
attitude of utter disdain towards the Third Way, while **[their own
radicalism ultimately amounts to an empty gesture which obliges no one
to do anything definite]{.underline}**. There is, of course, a strict
distinction to be made here between authentic social engagement on
behalf of exploited minorities (for example, organizing illegally
employed chicano field workers in California) and the
multiculturalist/postcolonial "plantations of no-risk, no-fault,
knock-off rebellion" which prosper in "radical" American academia. If,
however, in contrast to corporate multiculturalism", we define "critical
multiculturalism" as a strategy of pointing out that "there are common
forces of oppression, common strategies of exclusion, stereotyping, and
stigmatizing of oppressed groups, and thus common enemies and targets of
attack," I do not see the appropriateness of the continuing use of the
term "multiculturalism", since the accent shifts here to the common
struggle. In its normal accepted meaning, multiculturalism perfectly
fits the logic of the global market.

### Identity Link

#### The focus on retrieving lost narratives is valuable, but in the present moment, it trades off with revolution against capitalism -- the aff commits to transgression but it doesn't commit to transformed institutions, which lets it be coopted and commodified.

**Ertel '15** (Jacob, graduate of Oberlin College and former member of
Students for a Free Palestine, "Identity, Inc.: Liberal Multiculturalism
and the Political Economy of Identity Politics",
http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/identity-incorporated.html#.VppTmVMrJE4)

Identity, Inc. The aim here is not to critique identity politics in and
of itself as a method of organizing, but rather to demonstrate how
compatible it is with the discourse of liberal multiculturalism.
**[Identity politics]{.underline}** in part **[arose as a reaction to
the New Left\'s inability to account for difference in its
composition.]{.underline}** At the same time, a range of
political-economic factors such as the collapse of Fordism and the
consequent restructuring of the welfare state dissolved the New Left\'s
ability to maintain a veritable anti-capitalist disposition.
**[Reed]{.underline}** also **[points to the notable retreat of the Left
into academia and the materialization of identity politics as a
corollary of cultural studies and post-structuralist discourse
characterized by the \"rejection of any form of centralizing power or
notion of objective truth.\"]{.underline}**\[25\] **[In
practice]{.underline}**, according to Reed, **[this discourse translates
into \"a focus on the supposedly liberatory significance of communities
and practices defined by their marginality in relation to systems of
entrenched power or institutions, a preference for strategies of
\'resistance\']{.underline}** to imperatives of institutions **[and
\'transgression\']{.underline}** of conventions **[rather than
strategies aimed at transformation of institutions and social
relations]{.underline}**,\" and the belief that radical political
movements should be composed of \"groups formed around ascriptive
identities that relate to one another on a principle of recognizing and
preserving the integrity of their various differences.\" \[26\] **[Reed
opposes identity politics because he believes it uncritically accepts
capitalist social relations by focusing its efforts on transgression of
institutional norms rather than on institutions
themselves.]{.underline}** In recalling Puar\'s explication of the
manipulation of queer narratives after September 11, Reed\'s concern is
understandable because of how seamlessly **[difference is codified
through narratives of societal progress and liberal social values that
both pass implicit judgment on those who continue to reside outside the
parameters of normative liberal discourse, while legitimating
imperialist projects abroad]{.underline}** in opposition to putatively
less-accepting \'monocultural\' states. At the same time, **[activists
and scholars have argued in defense of identity politics as a radical
discourse that enables the \"re-creation of minority
histories]{.underline}** in a public sphere that had long been hostile
or indifferent to narratives of that self and community.\" For Grant
Farred, \"Identity politics...represents not only the marginal subject
speaking back, but a more engaging philosophical project: the oppressed
not only resisting but also negotiating the limitations of
agency.\"\[27\] In other words, the reclaiming of historical narratives
and the construction of intentional communities through identity
politics embodies the redefining of state-imposed limitations to
self-determination and can thus contribute to both radical social
transformation and a more nuanced and culturally aware Left. Indeed,
**[potential exists for identity politics to enable the construction of
previously censored histories or cultural narratives.]{.underline}**
There is certainly a perennial need within the Left for more complex
understandings of power, for more less dogmatic visions of emancipation,
and for a more expansive formulation of class-based politics. Yet
**[while all this may be true,]{.underline}** Wendy Brown explains,
**[identity politics is \"partly dependent on the demise of a critique
of capitalism and of bourgeois cultural and economic values,\" and
\"tethered to a formulation of justice which, ironically, reinscribes a
bourgeois ideal as its measure.\"]{.underline}** \[28\] Discursive
Dilemmas Drawing on Foucault\'s theoretical contributions, Brown notes
that **[identity]{.underline}** itself **[is produced through
disciplinary mechanisms that, when combined with
liberalism\'s]{.underline}** true **[inability to provide the universal
protections it claims to embody, results in \"the emergence of
politicized identity rooted in disciplinary productions but oriented by
liberal discourse toward protest against exclusion from a discursive
formation of universal justice.\"]{.underline}** \[29\] In other words,
**[the politicization of identity is discursively ineluctable from
liberalism\'s claim to universality.]{.underline}** Through this form of
protest, **[identity politics is driven by an inherent desire for
incorporation into this universal framework]{.underline}**, one that, as
we have seen through Mill and Kymlicka, has come to tolerate a degree of
diversity while presupposing the universal standard of the bourgeois
white male property owner. Such a standard can only function when
codified through the conferral of rights. Brown questions that **[if it
is \"this ideal against which many of the exclusions and privations of
people of color, gays and lesbians, and women are articulated, then the
political purchase of]{.underline}** contemporary American **[identity
politics would]{.underline}** seem to **[be achieved]{.underline}** in
part **[through a certain discursive renaturalization of
capitalism]{.underline}** that can be said to have marked progressive
discourse since the 1970s.\"\[30\] **[None of this is to deride the
tactics of]{.underline}** various social and **[political groups, but to
acknowledge how the destruction of the Fordist-Keynesian regime has made
it more difficult to center an analysis of class when the
already-insubstantial institutions of class-based social cohesion have
been so drastically eroded]{.underline}** since the 1970s and 1980s
especially. In this way we may understand neoliberalism not solely as
the political-economic reassertion of free market rationality, but also
as the reconstitution of Mill\'s brand of civic liberalism through a
multicultural discourse that, as Brown notes, \"retains the real or
imagined holdings of its reviled subject-in this case, the bourgeois
male privileges-as objects of desire.\" \[31\] **[Identity
politics]{.underline}** thus **[necessarily \"abjure\[s\] a critique of
class power and class norms]{.underline}** precisely **[because the
injuries suffered by these identities are measured by bourgeois norms of
social acceptance, legal protection, relative material comfort, and
social acceptance.\"]{.underline}**\[32\] **[The politicization of
identity under neoliberalism]{.underline}** thus **[arises through the
exclusion of identity from liberalism\'s presumptively universal
subjectivity]{.underline}**, thus **[reinstalling the ideal of the white
bourgeoisie as the base expression of such subjectivity.]{.underline}**
Politicized identity requires the maintenance of this universal
subjectivity, as well as its own exclusion from it, in order to endure
as identity itself.\[33\] **[As a vehicle for protesting
exclusion]{.underline}** through the incorporation of the interests of
social groups into the bourgeois power structure, **[identity politics
inadvertently reifies it while framing rights, recognition,
or]{.underline}** (in its most militant variation) **[the transgression
of norms as the actualization of resistance.]{.underline}** **[What
might an alternative political praxis to identity politics look like,
then?]{.underline}** How can the liberalism at the core of identity
politics actually be contested when it seems to be so pervasive within a
range of radical leftist circles? It is difficult to know for sure.
Perhaps **[it would entail a recommitment to challenging the liberal
discourse through which capitalism is legitimated.]{.underline}**
Perhaps **[it would include a recognition of and sensitivity towards the
intersectional character of difference while seeking to destabilize the
paradigm of transgression-as-revolution in lieu of a more fundamentally
materialist framework that specifically prioritizes working class
struggle.]{.underline}** Perhaps **[it would mean a re-articulation of
identity as a fluid rather than a historically and biologically fixed
point while continuing to center the importance of historical and
cultural narratives.]{.underline}** These are merely provocations,
however; it is ultimately up to the people to decide.

### Nation State/imperialism Link

#### Using imperialism as a focus point kills any chance at change ---capital is transnational and imperialism is a byproduct - this ends any chance at a perm and makes the impacts worse by affirming institutions of global capital.

**Robinson 7** (Professor of sociology at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, William, 2007, "Beyond the Theory of Imperialism: Global
Capitalism and the Transnational State" Societies Without Borders, 2
(2007) 5-26 p. 9-16, RSR)

Harvey offers no explicit conception of the state but he acknowledges
that state behavior has "depended on how the state has been constituted
and by whom." 17 Yet **[dual logics of state and capital ignore the
real-world policymaking process in which the state extends backward, is
grounded in the forces of civil society, and is fused in a myriad of
ways with capital itself.]{.underline}** It is incumbent to ask in what
ways transnational social forces may influence a reconstitution of state
institutions. **[To the extent that civil society -- social forces --
and capital are transnationalizing our analysis of the state cannot
remain frozen at a nation-state level. The essential problematic that
should concern us in attempting to explain phenomena associated with the
"new imperialism" is the political management]{.underline}** -- or rule
-- **[of global capitalism.]{.underline}** The theoretical gauntlet is
how to understand the exercise of political domination in relation to
the institutions available to dominant groups and sets of changing
historical relations among social forces -- that is, how are the
political and the economic articulated in the current era? **[This
requires a conception of agency and institutions]{.underline}**. **[But
instead of offering an ontology of agency and how it operates through
historically constituted institutions, much of the "new imperialism"
literature reifies these institutions. Institutions are but
institutionalized -- that is, codified -- patterns of interaction among
social forces that structure different aspects of their material
relations]{.underline}**. When we explain global dynamics in terms of
institutions that have an existence or agency independent of social
forces we are reifying these institutions. Critical state theories and
Gramscian IPE 18 have taught us, despite their limitations, that the
story starts -- and ends -- with historically situated social forces as
collective agents. To critique a nation-state framework of analysis as I
do, is not, as my critics claim19 to dismiss the nation-state but to
dereify it. Reifying categories leads to realist analyses of state power
and the inter-state system. Realism presumes that the world economy is
divided up into distinct national economies that interact with one
another. Each national economy is a billiard ball banging back and forth
on each other. This billiard image is then applied to explain global
political dynamics in terms of nation-states as discrete interacting
units (the inter-state system). The state, says Harvey, in reverting to
the realist approach, "struggles to assert its interests and achieve its
goals in the world at large." 20 But Harvey does not stop with this
reification of the state. **[He introduces an additional territorial
reification, so that territorial relations become immanent to social
relations]{.underline}**. "The wealth and well-being of particular
territories are augmented at the expense of others," writes Harvey. 21
This is a remarkably reii ed image -- "territories" rather than social
groups have "wealth" (accumulated values) and enjoy "well being." Harvey
gives space in this way an independent existence as a social/political
force in the form of territory in order to advance his thesis of the
"new imperialism." **[It is not how social forces are organized both in
space and through institutions that is the focus. Rather, for Harvey,
territory acquires a social existence of its own, an agentic logic. We
are told that "territorial entities" engage in practices of production,
commerce, and so on]{.underline}**. Do "territorial entities" really do
these things? Or is it not that in the real world, individuals and
social groups engage in production, commerce, and so on? And they do so
via institutions through which they organize, systematize, and demarcate
their activities as agents. **[Social groups became aggregated and
organized in the modern era through the particular institutional form of
the territorial-based nation state]{.underline}**. **[But this
particular institutional form does not acquire a life of its own and
neither is it immutable. Nation-states continue to exist but their
nature and meaning evolve as social relations and structures become
transformed]{.underline}**; particular, as they transnationalize.
Drawing on insights from Lafebvre, Marx, Luxemburg, and others, Harvey
earlier introduced the highly fertile notion of spatial (or
spatial-temporal) fixes to understand how capital momentarily resolves
contradictions (particularly, crises of overaccumulation) in one place
by displacing them to other places through geographic expansion and
spatial reorganization. Following Marx' famous observation that the
expanded accumulation of capital involves the progressive "annihilation
of space through time," he also coined the term "time-space compression"
in reference to globalization as a process involving a new burst of
time-space compression in the world capitalist system. 22 **[But
"places" have no existence or meaning in and of themselves. It is people
living in particular spaces that do this dis-placing (literally), these
spatiotemporal fixes.]{.underline}** The "asymmetric exchange relations"
that are at the heart of Harvey's emphasis on the territorial basis of
the "new imperialism" must be for Harvey territorial exchange relations.
But not only that: they must be nation-state territorial exchanges. But
**[exchange relations are social relations, exchanges among particular
social group]{.underline}**s. There is nothing in the concept of
asymmetric exchanges that by i at gives them a territorial expression;
no reason to assume that uneven exchanges are necessarily exchanges that
take place between distinct territories, much less specifically between
distinct nation states. That they do or do not acquire such an
expression is one of historical, empirical, and conjunctural analysis.
Certainly spatial relations among social forces have historically been
mediated in large part by territory; spatial relations have been
territorially-dei ned relations. **[But this territorialization is in no
way immanent to social relations and may well be fading in significance
as globalization advances. Any theory of globalization must address the
matter of place and space, including changing spatial relations among
social forces and how social relations are spatialized.]{.underline}**
This has not been satisfactorily accomplished, despite a spate of
theoretical proposition, ranging from Castell's "space of flows"
replacing the "space of place." 23 and Giddens "time-space
distanciation" as the "lifting" of social relations from territorial
place and their stretching around the globe in ways that may eliminate
territorial friction. 24 This notion of ongoing and novel
reconfigurations of time and social space is central to a number of
globalization theories. **[It in turn points to the larger theoretical
issue of the relationship of social structure to space, the notion of
space as the material basis for social practices]{.underline}**, and the
changing relationship under globalization between
territoriality/geography, institutions, and social structures. The
crucial question here is the ways in which globalization may be
transforming the spatial dynamics of accumulation and the institutional
arrangements through which it takes place. **[The subject -- literally,
that is, the agents/makers of the social world -- is not global space
but people in those spaces. What is central, therefore, is a spatial
reconfiguration of social relations beyond a nation-state/inter-state
framework]{.underline}**, if not indeed even beyond territory. States
are institutionalized social relations and territorial actors to the
extent that those social relations are territorialized. Nation-states
are social relations that have historically been territorialized but
those relations are not by definition territorial. **[To the extent that
the US and other national states promote deterritorializing social and
economic processes they are not territorial actors. The US state can
hardly be considered as acting territorially when it promotes the global
relocation of accumulation processes that were previously concentrated
in US territory]{.underline}**. Harvey's approach is at odds to explain
such behavior since by his definition the US state must promote its own
territorial aggrandizement. Harvey observes that as local banking was
supplanted by national banking in the development of capitalism "the
free flow of money capital across the national space altered regional
dynamics." 25 In the same vein we can argue that the free flow of
capital across global space alters these dynamics on a worldwide scale.
Let us return to the question: why would Harvey propose separate logics
for the economic and the political -- for capital and the state? **[By
separating the political and the economic he is able to claim that
indeed globalization has transformed the spatial dynamics of
accumulation -- hence capital globalizes -- but that the institutional
arrangements of such global accumulation remain territorial as
nation-states]{.underline}**. The state has its own independent logic
that brings it into an external relation to globalizing capital. **[Here
we arrive at the pitfall of theoreticism. If one starts with the
theoretical assumption that the world is made up of independent,
territorial-based nation states and that this particular
institutional-political form is something immanent to the modern world
-- Wood makes the assumption explicit, a law of
capitalism]{.underline}**; for Harvey it seems implicit -- then the
changing world of the 21st century must be explained by theoretical i at
in these terms. Reality must be made to conform to the theoretical
conception of an immutable nation-state based, inter-state political and
institutional order. But since Harvey acknowledges the reality of
globalizing capital he is therefore forced to separate the logic of that
globalizing capital from that of territorially-based states; he is
forced either to abandon the theoretical construct altogether or to
build it upon a dualism of the economic and the political, of capital
and the state. Theory needs to illuminate reality, not make reality
conform to it. **[The pitfall of this theoreticism is to develop
analyses and propositions to fit theoretical assumptions.]{.underline}**
Since received theories establish a frame of an inter-state system made
up of competing national states, economies and capitals then 21st
century reality must be interpreted so that it fits this frame one way
or another. **[Such theoreticism forces theorists of the "new
imperialism" into a schizophrenic dualism of economic and political
logics]{.underline}**. In any event Harvey has trapped himself in a
blind alley that underscores the pitfall. **[Despite his acknowledgement
of capital's transnationalization he concludes that the US state's
political/territorial logic is driven now by an effort to open up space
vis-à-vis competitor nation-states for unloading national capital
surplus, hence the new US imperialism. This inconsistency in Harvey's
argumentation reflects a general contradiction in the "new imperialism"
literature: the dualism of the economic and political, of capital and
the state, is negated by the claim that the US state functions to serve
(US national) capital.]{.underline}**

### Post-Modern Materialism Link

#### Their insistence that knowledge can't produce material change is false ideology -- voting neg instantiates a dialectical process that brings us closer to understanding and resisting capitalism.

**Workers Power 15** -- (11/13, "Marxism vs Post-Modernism,"
http://www.workerspower.net/marxism-vs-post-modernism)

And their signifying role is more important than either their use value
or exchange value**[. Ultimately, Baudrillard concluded that both
use]{.underline}** value **[and exchange value]{.underline}**
**[were]{.underline}** merely **["alibis" for the sign.]{.underline}**
**[The whole]{.underline}** "**[system]{.underline}** of signs" **[which
Marxism calls ideology]{.underline}**, the whole culture of mass
consumption, advertising, etc. **[was not the result of capitalist
production but its prime cause]{.underline}**. As we have indicated,
there is a logical contradiction between the generalized relativism of
Foucault and Derrida and **[the historically specific relativism of
Baudrillard]{.underline}**. But what they share **[is a retreat from
theory]{.underline}**, justified by a retreat from linguistic meaning.
**[Marxists object to this]{.underline}**: **[not because we believe
that language reflects reality]{.underline}** in a constantly "true" and
unmediated way, **[but because the linguistic "problem of
representation" can only be solved historically]{.underline}**. If there
is "only" language, and it bears no relationship to objective reality --
in Derrida's version of post-structuralism -- then why does language
change? If "discourse," as Foucault understands it, is not merely
language but the means whereby power systems come into being and
legitimize themselves, then what is the impulse which drives one power
structure to be replaced by another? It cannot be the subjective action
of human individuals since the human subject is hopelessly trapped in
the "determined" language and the predominant discourse of its time.
There is no convincing answer to these questions in the work of Foucault
and Derrida; the only consistent answer can be found in Marxism.
**[Dialectical materialism rejects the distinction between "knowing" and
"doing."]{.underline}** **[The "truth claims" and "truth
sentences"]{.underline}** derided by postmodernists on both linguistic
and epistemological grounds **[are always]{.underline}**, in the first
place, **[the product of human action]{.underline}** **[not of thinking
divorced from action]{.underline}**. For Marxists **[knowledge is
transforming action]{.underline}**. And **[this is not just a
"theory,"]{.underline}** or rival speculation; **[it is provable with
reference to every historical advance in knowledge]{.underline}**.
**[Every advance in knowledge is at the same time an advance in
technique]{.underline}**. Until very recently, human knowledge, of
necessity, trailed behind technique. Hunting lead to language, the stone
tool to drawing -- not the other way round. The answer to all skepticism
-- whether of the Quine, Rorty, Foucault, or Derrida types -- was given
by Marx as early as 1845 in the "Theses on Feuerbach": "The question
whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a
question of theory but is a practical question. In practice man must
prove the truth, i.e. the reality and power, the this-sidedness of his
thinking. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which
is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question."24 Ideology
As we have seen, both French post-structuralism and American
philosophical skepticism reject the possibility of ideology.
**[Ideology]{.underline}**, broadly speaking, **[means a set of ideas
arising from social conditions which serve to obscure the truth about
society]{.underline}**, **[legitimizing a specific form of class society
as the only "natural" or inevitable social formation]{.underline}**.
Marxism did not invent the concept; it was originated by the mechanical
materialism of the Enlightenment and the French revolution, and taken up
by Marx's idealist precursor, Hegel. Even in Marxism, **[there has been
intense debate about the nature and role of ideology]{.underline}**.25
**[Nevertheless, it remains a crucial concept for explaining the role of
language and logic in comprehending reality]{.underline}**: **[for
explaining why humankind]{.underline}** -- despite being engaged
constantly in "practice" -- **[comes up with false ideas]{.underline}**.
In the earliest exposition of the concept, "The German Ideology", Marx
and Engels start from the fact that, before there is thinking there is
being: before mind there is matter.26 Matter existed for millennia
before it produced a thinking animal. The human brain, where thinking
takes place, is also matter. Human consciousness was produced,
historically, by our interaction with the environment -- more
specifically our attempts to change it. This biological fact is at the
same time a social fact: humans are social animals. In order to interact
successfully with our environment, we must do so in societies. Our
social existence is crucial in producing our consciousness. **[As soon
as human beings raised their minds to questions of explaining the
world]{.underline}** around them they formed sets of ideas which were
conditioned by their social and physical environment: **[seaboard
societies worshipped sea gods]{.underline}**. **[But why did they
worship gods at all?]{.underline}** **[The religious impulse
appeared]{.underline}** to the early materialists **[as an absence of
reason]{.underline}**: ideology was humanity's substitute for not being
able to know the natural world and thus control it.
**[Marx]{.underline}** and Engels **[went beyond this rationalist
view]{.underline}** of ideology **[by showing how false ideas, as well
as true ones, have real material roots]{.underline}**: "We set out from
real, active men and on the basis of their real life-process we
demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of
this life process." But: "If in all ideology men and their circumstances
appear upside down as in a camera obscura \[a pinhole camera\], this
phenomenon arises just as much as from their historical life process as
the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life
process." **[The act of subordinating nature to human control did not
just push back the boundaries of ideology]{.underline}**; **[it was done
through society, and because all society until now has been
systematically unequa]{.underline}**l -- class based -- **[social
development created and reinforced ideology]{.underline}**. **[Ideology
is formed not just by physical conditions but by social
conditions]{.underline}**, specifically the most fundamental social
conditions -- **[the way we produce wealth]{.underline}**, what Marx
called the economic "structure" or base. This gives rise to a whole
series of social institutions and modes of behavior, which in turn
condition human thought: "The sum total of these relations of production
constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on
which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond
definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of
material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life
processes in general."27 **[The many-layered mediating
process]{.underline}** between economic production and social thought
**[mean that ideology can be varied within a given
society]{.underline}**. **[There can be ideologies of resistance as well
as of reaction]{.underline}**. "The blacks are taking our jobs and
destroying our national culture" is one example of ideology. **[For the
same reason that we have jumbo jets that fly, we can have ideas that
challenge ideology]{.underline}**. **[Science]{.underline}**, applied to
the physical world, **[produces hypotheses provable by interaction with
that world]{.underline}**. **[Social practice can equip us with the
vision to see beneath the external appearances thrown up by social
structures]{.underline}**. **[Anybody wanting to free humanity from the
necessity of having to endure exploitation at work, to starve, and
suffer oppression has to identify the obstacles that stand in the way of
freedom]{.underline}**. **[Collective struggle has the power to blow
away ideology]{.underline}** -- **[maybe only partially but at least in
the most crucial areas]{.underline}** -- **[and allow those resisting
oppression to come to a scientific view of their
predicament]{.underline}**. **[It is a fact that the collective class
struggle is the greatest counterweight to crude, overt, and crippling
racism of the kind quoted above]{.underline}**. Ultimately, the working
class will not dispel capitalist ideology in all its forms without
uprooting capitalism itself. But the most collectively active section of
the working class is able to see through the decisive parts of that
ideology, especially when its spontaneous insights are combined with,
and codified into, a scientific counter-argument for socialism. Contrast
all this with the views of post-structuralism and neo-skepticism.

### Prison Abolition Link

#### Only through the eradication of racial capitalism can prisons be abolished -- mass incarceration is simply the most recent incarnation of unjust and brutal punishment tactics against people of color 

**Calathes 17** (William Calathes, Dept of Criminal Justice -- New
Jersey City University, "Racial capitalism and punishment philosophy and
practices: what really stands in the way of prison abolition" published
in Contemporary Justice Review Issues in Criminal, Social, and
Restorative Justice, Vol.4, Issue 4, October 12, 2017.
https://doi.org/10.1080/10282580.2017.1383774)

**[Due to their singular focus on the criminal justice system,
traditional criminologists overlook injustices that undergird racial
capitalism and its punishment philosophy and practices]{.underline}**.
Traditional criminal justice beliefs in retribution, deterrence, and
incarceration function to mediate desires for group-based social
inequality and dominance, on the one hand, and support for severe forms
of criminal sanctions meted out against the exploited and oppressed
group, on the other. **[The result is the continued maintenance of a
political economy that protects the capital accumulation of white elites
and the privileges of non-elite white people.]{.underline}** From a
critical criminological perspective, however, racial capitalism is seen
for what it is -- a 5 system that victimizes a significant segment of
society based on the need to control and perpetrate harm on a portion of
the population for gain (Michalowski, 1985). **['There have been great
abolition movements that have opposed slavery, lynching, and
segregation']{.underline}** (Abu-Jamal & Davis, 2012, p. 61), **[but
following each, new forms of oppression replaced old ones. Racialized
punishment has waxed and waned with philosophy based on]{.underline}**
10 **[race and white elites' need to control the populace, but it
persists over time because it pro- vides political, social, and economic
stability required for continued white elite capital accu- mulation and
white privilege dependent on a white majority being held together by
racial definition.]{.underline}** Racialized punishment, the
criminalization of non-white bodies, and the legal codification of
servitude can be found across the differential space-times of
plantations and 15 prisons (Davis, 2003). **['Mass incarceration is
simply the most recent incarnation of how human bondage and racial
repression \... strive to reassert themselves albeit in different faces
and forms']{.underline}** (Abu-Jamal & Davis, 2012, p. 62). **[The
system of racial capitalism punishes by definition, and all capitalism
is racial capitalism.]{.underline}** The traditional mode of class rule
demands two races -- the racially oppressed and the 20 racially
privileged, and racialized punishment is part of that dialectic. It
becomes part of the dominant political order because **[continued white
elite control of the political economy results in definitions of crimes
and punishments as only state-made law, or extra-legal pun- ishments,
with an almost complete exclusion of elite criminality, thus immunizing
white elites. Exploiting and punishing others for capital accumulation
should be a crime, but is not]{.underline}** 25 **[defined as such in a
racially capitalist society where punishments only derive from the fact
that private property drives social inequalities. Such a society
'insists upon the marginaliza- tion and punishment of others in the form
of racism, as the state-sanctioned or extralegal production and
exploitation of the group-differentiated']{.underline}** (Gilmore, 2007,
p. 28). White capital accumulation primarily arose by enslaving
Africans, but 'in order for the 30 white race to function effectively as
a means of social control, the most degraded white man must feel
socially superior to any person of colour who walks the earth'
(Ignatiev, 2003, p. 233). **[White supremacy and white privilege based
on chattel slavery's anti-blackness con- tinue on slavery's afterlife
because all white people differentiate themselves from people of color
to maintain their status and rewrite the racial contract according to
their specific needs]{.underline}** 35 (Mills, 1997). Racial capitalism
developed a pro-white racial ideology that has been shared across class
lines. This ideology has permitted white elites and white non-elites to
create, rationalize, and then ignore the unjust and brutal punishment
practices meted out against people of color. Racialization is the core
quality of capitalism; therefore, racial capitalism -- based on the 40
**[exploitation and oppression of others]{.underline}** -- is
pathologically conceived. It **[is a system sustained by punishment
philosophy and practices that are rooted in class and
race,]{.underline}** and are supported by social-psychological dynamics
derived from the social construction of 'whiteness.' Whiteness serves as
'a barrier to effective change as the system of racial classification
con- tinues to operate to protect entrenched power' (Harris, 1993, p.
1709). White elites oppose 45 abolition because prisons, like the
punishment practices of the past, directly serve their capital
accumulating objectives. Similarly, white non-elites do so as well,
because prisons, like the punishment practices of the past, serve to
protect their white privilege. **[Standing in the way of prison
abolition (as it has stood in the way of other abolition movements) is
racial capitalism. Only through its total eradication can we have a
fully successful prison abolition movement.]{.underline}** But simply
calling for the eradication of racial capitalism, of course, is not
sufficient. The pathology of race and capitalism is too dominant.
Racialism is a routine manifestation and the organizers of the
capitalist world appropriate labor power as a constant power (Robinson,
1983), and punishment practices fit neatly into the routine of the
practice of racial domina- tion. **[Given the reality of this
oppression, generally the only thing that matters to most non- elites,
black and white, is survival, so developing the needed revolutionary
consciousness opposing this racial domination is no small task.
Ultimately, therefore,]{.underline}** **[what impedes prison abolition
is not simply racial capitalism, but the unfortunate failure, to date,
of the development of a proletarian revolutionary consciousness of
workers of all colors. Racial capitalism can be dismantled and once this
is accomplished, we can move forward to develop and implement more
humanistic and just responses to all human
transgressions.]{.underline}**

### Queerness Link

#### The aff starts from a politics of queer atonality -- a reduction of queerness to basic deviance that deprives it of moral or political force -- instead, we should have a politics of queer communality that refuses the 1AC's strong commitment to anti-normativity in favor of direct institutional transformation

**Galloway 2014** (Alexander, Professor of Media, Culture, and
Communication at New York University, "Queer Atonality,"
http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/queer-atonality)

Rosenberg devotes much of her attention to queer theory's "subjectless
turn" and the shift toward what David Eng, Judith Halberstam, and José
Muñoz in 2005 called the "wide field of normalization." Yet here **[the
question is not so much a shift within queer theory, but a growing
normalization]{.underline}**\--and a newfound trendiness perhaps\--**[of
the concept of queer in culture at large.]{.underline}** Thus **[today
any number of folks in straight relationships might still wish to label
themselves "queer," just as there is a growing trend to think about
queer societies,]{.underline}** queer **[animals,]{.underline}** and
indeed queer **[organisms,]{.underline}** queer molecules,
**[and]{.underline}** queer **[ontologies.]{.underline}** Rosenberg
calls out Tim Morton\'s essay "Queer Ecology," but the trend is wider
than a single text can reveal, as evidenced by Karen Barad\'s work on
"Nature's Queer Performativity," or the promulgation in other circles of
what we might call a Queer-Deleuzian metaphysics. Borrowing the concept
of the \"atonal\" (atone) from Badiou\'s theory of points, it is
possible to assign a name to the specific form of queerness that
Rosenberg finds unnerving: queer atonality. **[By queer atonality we
mean the notion that queerness can be abstracted to mean deviation as
such]{.underline}**, aleatoriness as such, or openness as such, **[and
thus, through such extreme abstraction, queerness may be assigned as a
proper monicker for biological and even ontological
systems.]{.underline}** In other words, if biology is that thing that
works via difference and radical openness, then it is, by definition,
queer. Or if ontology is a scenario of swerves and deviations, then it
is, by definition, queer. As Rosenberg puts it, on the one hand "biology
\[is understood\] as a kind of sheer queerness (or, aleatoriness)," and,
on the other, matter "is coded as ontologically \'queer.\'" But **["do
we truly want to be unleashed into pure aleatoriness?"]{.underline}**
wonders Rosenberg. **[Such is the Pyrrhic victory of queer atonality:
"If queerness is nothing but the productive force of matter, then why
continue to call it queer?"]{.underline}** **[As a deviation from
normality, queerness has typically carried a kind of ethical or
political force simply by virtue of intervening and resisting. We\'re
here, we\'re queer]{.underline}** demands acknowledgement, and thus a
disruption of bourgeois morality. **[In this sense, queer means
essentially \"queering.\"]{.underline}** As Nicholas de Villiers writes
in his book on queer opacity, queering is a tactic aimed at
appropriating, transforming, or deviating from a particular normative
category. In this way, queer might have no ontological dimension per se,
but rather might be defined as that thing unable to be integrated into
existing symbolic economies, be they sexual or otherwise.
**[But]{.underline}** if **[today]{.underline}**, following in the wake
of the new queer metaphysics, matter and organic life themselves are
queer, then the **[queer intervention becomes as atonal as anything
else]{.underline}**: the queerness of quantum superposition, the
queerness of interspecies viral transfection, the queerness of
non-carbon-based life forms. **[What started as a process of strategic
intervention, has now congealed into a state of \"sheer\"
queerness.]{.underline}** Further, **[ontologizing queerness produces a
number of secondary effects]{.underline}**, not all of which we can
discuss here. **[One important additional issue]{.underline}**
though\--and this parallels some of my previous commentary on Catherine
Malabou, whose work I find tremendously useful\--**[is]{.underline}**
what might be called **[the "morality conundrum."]{.underline}** In
short: **[if ontology is pure aleatoriness and if ontology has no
particular political]{.underline}** or moral **[valence, then, barring
the kind of unmitigated nihilism that makes all politics impossible, one
is obligated to graft on a secondary moral theory]{.underline}** to
supplement the primary ontological one. Consider Malabou: **[if all is
plasticity,]{.underline}** then **[how can an individual judge
good]{.underline}** plasticity **[from bad plasticity?]{.underline}** By
what criterion may we assert, with confidence, that capitalist precarity
(one form of plasticity) is odious, while neuronal adaptiveness (another
form of plasticity) is not? Such is the curious irony of queer
atonality. **[What began as a movement that, in part, sought to purge
itself of the priggish prejudices of sexual moralism]{.underline}**, and
the bigotry and oppression that goes with it, **[must now author its own
treatise on morality!]{.underline}** Having been elevated to the level
of being, **[queer theory must demonstrate its own deviation from
being.]{.underline}** **[Having been neutralized, queerness must now
un-neutralize itself.]{.underline}** I follow this thread not to revel
in futility, nor to expose queer theory to another kind of derision, now
from the left rather than the right. Instead let\'s ask what we might
gain from ontologizing queerness? And what we might lose? Or to put the
question another way: if there were a queering of ontology, what should
it look like? I can think of two ways to address the question, one more
negative and the other more affirmative. But there are certainly many
other possible approaches suggested by others. Response A: Viewed
skeptically, queer ontology appears to be something of a contradiction
in terms, simply because ontology itself is offensive and oppressive to
queer life and identity. Ontology reproduces the very structure of queer
alterity, given how ontology tends to be transcendental, abstracting,
totalizing, and tied historically to concepts of hierarchy and morality,
etc. "Ontology," Frantz Fanon wrote in Black Skin, White Masks, "does
not permit us to understand the being of the black man." And thus, by
homology, **[ontology does not permit us to understand the being of the
queer.]{.underline}** This response seems absolutely valid and yet at
the same time somewhat limiting. Absolutely valid\--in the sense that
metaphysics has often been used as a weapon against the poor, women,
people of color, or anyone on the losing end of moral or metaphysical
models of alterity. But also limiting\--in the sense that ignoring such
questions will not magically cause them to disappear; any theoretical
undertaking, when pursued long enough, must come to terms with questions
of being, appearing, and existing. Indeed, ontology "does not
permit"\--as Fanon rightly said\--but only when ontology is understood
as representation or metaphysics. What if there were such a thing as a
non-standard ontology? Could a non-standard ontology allow us to
withdraw from structures of oppression? And could it facilitate such a
withdrawal, while avoiding the problem of atonality and maintaining the
many specificities of people\'s real culture and history? Response B:
This leads to a second response, one that I see as much more useful:
**[a queer theory of ontology is]{.underline}** indeed
**[possible]{.underline}**. **[But]{.underline}** how would it look?
**[It might not "look queer" in the]{.underline}** aforementioned
**[sense of queer atonality]{.underline}** that Rosenberg calls into
question, that is, an ontology **[rooted in aleatoriness, deviation,
non-normativity]{.underline}**, and so on. **[Such a new queer theory of
ontology would not be queer per se]{.underline}**\--that\'s by
design\--**[but]{.underline}** would be **[roomy enough for
queerness]{.underline}**, along with other forms of life and other kinds
of being in the world. Consider two different approaches. The first is a
kind of hypertrophic instance of what, in theoretical circles, is called
intersectionalism. We can understand such hypertrophic intersectionalism
as a maximally heterogenous set of all forms of difference, brought into
community without sacrificing the specificity and difference of all
members of the set. This is not unlike how Hardt & Negri have defined
the "multitude," the multitude as capacious heterogeneity unmarked by
homogenizing abstractions like "the masses" or "the people." (It would
take another blog post to demonstrate how the multitude is not simply a
new form of queer atonality; but I think the argument can be made
effectively.) The second approach comes from a different angle. If
intersectionalism is maximally heterogenous, **[a different
approach]{.underline}** also **[exists]{.underline}**, **[the minimally
heterogenous.]{.underline}** Here, **[the community of alterity is
defined not in terms of radical difference, but radical
commonality.]{.underline}** Similar to the concept of the "generic" in
Laruelle or Badiou, **[I see a new potential for queer ontology to be
understood in terms of radical equality via axiomatic exploration of the
insufficiency of identity.]{.underline}** Indeed, Rosenberg links
queerness to the concept of collectivity. This is the crucial step in my
view. Summoning the allegorical style of Fredric Jameson, Rosenberg
directs our attention not to "the subject per se, or \'the human,\' but
the collective." And isn\'t this what materialism has always sought?
"Surely the collective is that aleatory togetherness of which the
ontological turn dreams." So, **[instead of queerness as the productive
force of aleatory matter, we might pursue]{.underline}** instead **[the
concept of a "queer event"]{.underline}** or the "event of queer
collectivity." I suspect that **[such an event would not
follow]{.underline}** some of the more **[familiar models from the past:
event as deviation, difference, or alterity.]{.underline}** Given that
queer atonality is simply the macro form of such smaller
deviations\--the model of turbulence and churn described so well in
Queer Deleuzianism\--such theories of deviation have a limited utility.
In addition, the queer event would most certainly not follow a
productive or reproductive mandate; this being one of the most powerful
discoveries of queer theory, that the queer body is not obligated to
make anything. Instead **[we might explore the concept of a queer
communism]{.underline}**, or what Rosenberg simply labels the
collectivity. **[This strikes me as particularly useful and urgent
today.]{.underline}** In other words, **[Rosenberg\'s essay reveals that
today\'s onto-primitivism is really a march toward
proletarianization]{.underline}**, which we might simply define as the
bracketing of social collectivity in the name of material necessity.
**[Such proletarianization must be identified as such, and resisted as
frequently and as thoroughly as possible.]{.underline}** Or as Rosenberg
puts it, "Let it never be said of us that our consciousness was sheerly
molecular, that we truly believed that all the baleful historical
foreclosures of capitalism were ontologically true." **[Never believe
that capitalism is ontologically true\... This is]{.underline}**, in
essence, **[the first step toward exploring any form of
collectivity.]{.underline}** **[Queer atonality blocks such a movement,
not because queerness has been fully co-opted]{.underline}** and hence
has nothing more to offer. On the contrary, the problem with queer
ontology lies in ontology not queerness, for **[the standard model of
ontology]{.underline}** is one that is sufficient to itself and thus
**[promulgates a structure of transcendental mastery, rational autonomy,
and sufficiency for all.]{.underline}** Queer communism, by contrast,
resides in the making-insufficient of such philosophical structures.
**[Queer communism reorients queerness away from deviation and alterity
and toward the "weak" insufficiency of collectivity, a life lived in
common with others]{.underline}**, whosoever they may be.

### Starting Point Link

#### Capitalism is the root cause of everything and you started from the wrong place -- listing violence isn't going to get it done -- we need to start with a methodology that links violences to capitalism and calls for unified organization against it

**Sell '15** (Hannah, Socialist Party of England and Wales, sister party
of Socialist Alternative, "IDENTITY POLITICS AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST
OPPRESSION"
http://www.socialistalternative.org/2015/11/02/identity-politics-struggle-oppression/)

**[Over recent years there has been a growth in support
for]{.underline}** what can broadly be described as **['identity
politics' among]{.underline}** many mainly **[young people who
are]{.underline}** rightly angry about and **[radicalised by, their
experience of sexism, racism, homophobia, prejudice against disabled
people]{.underline}** and other forms of oppression. In one sense,
identity politics is an inevitable part of the political awakening of
many members of oppressed groups within society. Recognising that you
are oppressed, and that you can fight against your oppression through a
common struggle with others who share the same oppression, is a vital
first step. However, **[the history of struggle against oppression shows
that]{.underline}**, on the basis of experience, **[those participating
tend to go beyond identity politics as they recognise the root cause of
their oppression lies in the structure of society.]{.underline}** The
highest point of the vast rebellion against racism in the US in the
1950s and 1960s, for example, was reached by **[the Black
Panthers]{.underline}**, who **[were founded]{.underline}** in 1966
**[with the magnificent concept:]{.underline}** "We do not fight racism
with racism. We fight racism with solidarity. We do not fight
exploitative capitalism with black capitalism. **[We fight capitalism
with basic socialism".]{.underline}** Today, **[both]{.underline}** the
\#**[BlackLivesMatter]{.underline}** rebellion **[and the movement for
\$15 Now are the first stages of a new mass uprising]{.underline}**
against poverty and racism in the US. **[However, the pushing back of
consciousness globally over the decades following the collapse of
Stalinism in the late 1980s and the capitalist triumphalism that
accompanied it, mean that the new movements did not begin where the
Panthers left off, with a socialist outlook.]{.underline}** Nonetheless,
there is a growing anti-capitalist mood among young people in the US,
which is a first step to drawing socialist conclusions. At the same
time, **[identity politics is many activists' starting
point.]{.underline}** **[While those involved in struggle may see this
mainly as a means to fight back, the form of identity politics that has
emanated from the universities and has dominated over recent decades
concentrates overwhelmingly on discussing personal experience of
oppression rather than trying to find the means to end it. This
includes]{.underline}** all the strands of identity politics that have
become more prominent in recent years, such as **[intersectionality and
privilege theory.]{.underline}** **[In Britain these concepts remain
little known in wider society]{.underline}** but have become commonplace
in, for example, university feminist societies. Intersectionalists argue
that different oppressions 'intersect'. Indeed, they do: a black
working-class woman is triply oppressed, for example. But
**[intersectionalists often see their role as cataloguing and describing
oppressions and their intersections rather than abolishing them.
Supporters of 'privilege theory' are best known for telling people to
'check their privilege']{.underline}** during (often online) debates.
The founder of privilege theory, Peggy **[McIntosh]{.underline}**,
**[argued that a white, upper-class, heterosexual man]{.underline}**,
for example, **[is carrying around an 'invisible knapsack' full of
unearned privileges.]{.underline}** The argument goes that power is not
concentrated in the hands of one class, or in the state, but is spread
throughout society and therefore exists in all social and interpersonal
relationships. Privilege theory states that every individual is part of
a multiplicity of oppressive relationships. It concentrates
overwhelmingly on exhortations to individuals to change, to check their
privilege. **[But it is not possible to eliminate either oppressions or
privileges merely by exhorting individuals to change their
behaviour.]{.underline}** In fact, in many countries there have been
significant improvements in social attitudes to different forms of
oppression in recent decades, but they have not resulted in the ending
of the oppressions concerned. Racism ingrained **[In Britain, for
example,]{.underline}** while racist prejudices are still widespread,
**[crude racist ideas are far less socially acceptable
than]{.underline}** they were **[30 years ago. This has come about for a
number of reasons, above all]{.underline}** the determination and
increased **[confidence of black and Asian people to fight
discrimination]{.underline}** and racism. **[Another important factor
was]{.underline}** the **[widespread involvement of black and Asian
workers in]{.underline}** the **[trade unions]{.underline}** in a common
struggle alongside white workers. Both of these factors helped to foster
a strong feeling among a large section of the white population,
especially youth, that racism is wrong and should be combated.
**[Nonetheless, racism remains deeply ingrained]{.underline}** in
British society. The police are up to 28 times more likely to stop and
search you if you are black or Asian. The gap between average pay for
white workers and those from ethnic minorities has actually increased
over recent years despite an improvement in social attitudes. Over half
of young black men are unemployed, more than double the unemployment
rate for young white men. **[In the US the situation is even
starker.]{.underline}** While deep-rooted racism remains there has also
been an improvement in social attitudes. There has been the development
of a black middle class and even a small black elite. Both processes are
reflected in the election of a black man as US president. The vast
majority of the black population, however, remain among the poorest and
most oppressed in society, facing violent state repression. One hundred
and thirty five African Americans were killed by the police in the first
half of 2015 alone. **[Racism does not just stem from individual
prejudices but]{.underline}** from something more fundamental: **[the
nature of capitalism as it has actually developed.]{.underline}**
Malcolm X correctly declared that, "you can't have capitalism without
racism". **[Capitalism]{.underline}**, as Karl Marx famously said,
**[came into being "dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with
blood and dirt".]{.underline}** (Capital, Volume 1, Chapter 31) He was
referring, particularly, to the role of slavery in the accumulation of
capital. With slavery came the development of all kinds of
pseudo-scientific racist theories designed to justify the enslavement of
African peoples. Racist ideas were then adapted to justify the colonial
oppression of large parts of the world. **[Capitalism was forced to
abandon direct colonial rule as a result of the magnificent
revolutionary movements that took place against it. Economic
exploitation]{.underline}**, however, **[is more brutal than
ever.]{.underline}** Two hundred and fifty years ago the gap between the
richest and poorest countries was around five to one. Today it is 400 to
one. **[Racism is used to justify this vast gulf and]{.underline}** also
**[that black workers are usually among the poorest and most oppressed
sections of the working class even in the 'rich'
countries.]{.underline}** Women's oppression **[Similarly, blatant
sexism is no longer acceptable in the way it would have been in the
past]{.underline}**, particularly in the economically advanced
capitalist countries. Women have won greater rights in recent decades.
There are different factors that have led to this, including the
development of improved and widely available contraception. However,
many of these gains can be traced back to the growing confidence of
women as a result of many more women working rather than being isolated
in the home. **[Nonetheless, women continue to be
oppressed.]{.underline}** **[This]{.underline}** oppression
**[stems]{.underline}**, **[not]{.underline}** merely **[from the
attitudes of men]{.underline}**, **[but from the role of women and the
family in capitalist and earlier class societies.]{.underline}** Most of
us think of 'the family' as the individuals who make up our own family,
who are often the people who are closest to us. Historically, however,
the family as an institution has also acted within class societies as an
agent of social control with the father as 'head of the household'
having responsibility for disciplining women and children. While this
concept has been weakened in the modern era by the growing confidence of
women, it is far from eliminated. The idea remains deeply ingrained that
women are possessions of men and that we need to be loyal and obedient
to our partners, and that violence and coercion are acceptable means for
men to achieve that, both towards 'their' women and 'their' children. It
is no longer socially acceptable to openly state that women are the
possessions of men, yet these ideas were enshrined in law until
relatively recently. Marital rape only became illegal in Britain in
1991, Spain in 1992, and Germany in 1997. While no longer legal or
openly acceptable, marital rape is still widespread and rarely punished.
It is estimated that in Britain only 15% of all rapes are reported to
the police, and only 7% of those result in conviction. According to the
UN, of all the women killed globally in 2012 almost half were killed by
their partners or family members. In contrast, only 6% of killings with
male victims were committed by intimate partners or family members. At
the same time, women continue to bear the brunt of domestic
responsibilities despite increasingly also going out to work. In many
cases women are still, as the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky put it,
the 'slaves of slaves'. While in Britain, for example, most studies show
men accepting that they should do an equal amount of domestic chores as
women, there is still a considerable gap between intentions and reality.
One survey showed that on average women did 17 hours a week of domestic
chores (excluding childcare) whereas men did less than six. **[It is
true]{.underline}**, therefore, **[that men get some gain from women's
disproportionate bearing of the domestic burden]{.underline}**, in
having a few more hours leisure time. **[The main gain, however, is for
capitalism.]{.underline}** By putting the main burden of domestic life,
the bringing up of the next generation (from which the future workforce
is drawn), and caring for the sick and elderly on women, they are
removed from the responsibility of society as a whole. Power
concentrated in the capitalist class **[To suggest that power is not
concentrated in one class is to completely misunderstand the nature of
capitalism.]{.underline}** **[Today, wealth and power is concentrated in
fewer hands]{.underline}** -- the owners of the major banks and
corporations -- **[even than when Marx was writing.]{.underline}**
According to Oxfam, the richest 85 people on earth -- a double-decker
bus full -- have as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's
population. The richest 85 include five women and one African, although
white men predominate. Their role in society, however, does not stem
primarily from their colour or gender but that they are part of a tiny
super-wealthy ruling elite. **[The world's 100 biggest companies now
control 70% of global trade.]{.underline}** **[Even if their boards of
directors included many more black people or women it would not make any
material difference to the exploitation suffered by the working class
and poor worldwide]{.underline}**, not least black women. Look at South
Africa, where the incorporation of a tiny minority of blacks into the
capitalist class has made no difference to the dire poverty suffered by
the majority. And capitalism is increasingly incapable of taking society
forward. **[Many of the rights partially taken for granted by previous
generations in Europe, like a relatively secure job, home and pension,
are now things of the past. To say that social relations in modern
society are capitalist relations is not to take an 'economic
determinist' view of society]{.underline}**: arguing that every aspect
of the 'superstructure' of society -- the state, politics, culture,
social attitudes and so on -- are rigidly determined by the character of
the economy. **[On the contrary, there is an inter-relationship between
the two.]{.underline}** At the same time, **[politics and social
attitudes reflect not only the current character of capitalism but also
remnants of the past and]{.underline}** -- particularly in mass
struggles of the working class and the oppressed -- **[the seeds of a
potential better future.]{.underline}** Nonetheless, **[it is clear that
as long as we live in a capitalist society]{.underline}**, where wealth
and power rests with the tiny elite who own and control industry,
science and technology, then **[the superstructure of that society
will]{.underline}** also **[ultimately reflect and act in the interests
of that ruling elite. No amount of demanding that people 'check their
privilege' will eliminate social attitudes generated and sustained by
capitalism.]{.underline}** **[While determined mass struggle can force
capitalism to adapt to a certain extent -- as]{.underline}** has been
the case **[with LGBT rights, equal pay legislation]{.underline}** and
other measures -- **[permanent and deep-rooted change]{.underline}**,
particularly where it threatens the functioning of capitalism, **[will
only be achieved by the socialist transformation of society. The
horrific bureaucratic degeneration and]{.underline}** then **[collapse
of the Soviet Union have obscured the importance of the Russian
revolution]{.underline}** in giving a glimpse of what socialism would
mean for those suffering oppression. In Russia in 1917 the working class
led a movement of the oppressed which successfully overthrew capitalism
for the first, and so far, the only time. Russia's extreme poverty and
the isolation of the new workers' state led to its degeneration.
Nonetheless, in the early days it gave a glimpse of how a new society
could overcome oppressions that had existed for millennia. **[In
'backward' Russia, legal changes were introduced very quickly which were
many decades ahead of any capitalist country.]{.underline}** These
included **[universal suffrage, civil marriage and
divorce]{.underline}** when requested by either partner, **[equal pay,
paid maternity leave, the right to abortion and the legalisation of
homosexuality.]{.underline}** **[Oppressed nationalities were given the
genuine right to self-determination.]{.underline}** Measures were taken
to encourage nationalities and cultures oppressed under tsarism,
including the development of a written form of some languages for the
first time. Of course, legal or formal measures do not in themselves end
oppression. Decades after the passing of equal pay legislation in
Britain, for example, women still earn an average of £5,000 a year less
than men. Addressing women's oppression in the Soviet Union, Trotsky
described how legal equality was a step forward but actual equality in
social relations required a far more "deep-going plough", capable of
providing real economic equality and lifting the domestic burden from
women, and transforming social attitudes ingrained over millennia. A
whole number of measures began to be introduced in the aftermath of the
Russian revolution (including free childcare, communal restaurants and
public laundries) which, while never fully implemented due to the
degeneration of the Soviet Union, gave a glimpse of how the domestic
burden could be lifted. That, in turn, could have laid the foundations
for the building of a society based on women's equality. **[Many
intersectionalists put very little emphasis on campaigning for economic
and practical measures to lift the burden on women]{.underline}**,
instead **[concentrating overwhelmingly on social attitudes, and trying
to create spaces]{.underline}** within society **[that are free of
oppression.]{.underline}** Yet **[freeing women from the heavy load of
being the carers, cooks and cleaners for the whole of society is an
essential prerequisite for ending women's oppression.]{.underline}**
**[Twenty-first century capitalism]{.underline}**, far from taking steps
towards this, **[is driving in the opposite direction. Austerity affects
women severely.]{.underline}** It includes huge cuts in public services
that partially lifted some of the responsibilities that fall on women.
David Cameron's big society could be summed up as demanding that women
compensate for the cuts to health, child and elderly care by taking the
burden on themselves. This is a demonstration that under capitalism,
even where oppressed groups make gains, they are never guaranteed to be
permanent. **[This also applies to the devastating, sometimes
life-threatening, consequences of austerity for disabled
people.]{.underline}** Combating prejudice **[Pointing out the need for
fundamental change in society does not]{.underline}** in any way
**[downgrade the importance of combating oppressive]{.underline}** and
reactionary **[ideas]{.underline}** and practices while we live in this
society, including within the workers' movement. **[However, this will
by necessity be a constant battle.]{.underline}** **[Intersectionalists
call for 'safe spaces']{.underline}** with zero tolerance for anything
considered an oppressive view. But it is utopian to try and create a
safe space which is sealed off from the society in which we all live and
are affected by. **[Turning inwards in order to concentrate on doing so
-- rather than turning out to build a movement capable of winning real
change -- is doomed to frustration and failure.]{.underline}** Far from
creating safe spaces, this can often lead to an undemocratic
environment, where the individuals dominant in a particular 'space'
assert that they feel oppressed by ideas and opinions they disagree
with. **[There is]{.underline}** also **[a dangerous tendency to suggest
that the value of someone's contribution to a discussion should be based
primarily on what oppressions they as an individual suffer
from.]{.underline}** **[This is completely false.]{.underline}**
Britain's first and only female prime minister, **[Margaret
Thatcher]{.underline}**, **[undoubtedly suffered]{.underline}**
individual oppression **[as a woman, but the neo-liberal
programme]{.underline}** she drove through **[was completely against the
interests of working-class women.]{.underline}** Recently, Jeremy
**[Corbyn]{.underline}**, the new left leader of the Labour Party,
**[has been attacked]{.underline}** supposedly **[for not having enough
women in his shadow cabinet]{.underline}**, although his front bench is
the first that has been majority women. More women voted for Corbyn than
for the other right-wing candidates (two of whom were women) in the
leadership election because he stood against austerity. **[Had he chosen
a pro-austerity woman]{.underline}** as shadow chancellor rather than
the left MP, John McDonnell, **[most]{.underline}** of the women **[who
voted for him would have]{.underline}** correctly **[been deeply
disappointed.]{.underline}** The issue of safe spaces also relates to
intersectionalists' views on gender: that the concept of two genders is
a social construct and, in reality, gender is more like a spectrum.
**[Emphasis is often put on supporting transgender people]{.underline}**
and all those who rebel against societal gender constraints. This
includes some who do not identify as either male or female but as
'gender-non-conforming'. **[This reflects a positive rejection of
current gender relations]{.underline}** and homophobia by a growing
number of young people. Socialists, of course, support the democratic
right of individuals to define both their own gender and sexuality.
**[However, while there is radicalisation among an important layer on
this issue, that does not mean it is possible to create, as some
intersectionalists attempt, spaces within capitalist society completely
free from societal pressures regarding gender. Capitalism shapes the
outlook of all of us from the time we are born]{.underline}**, with all
of the distortions of the human personality that creates. **[This
includes how we are expected to behave appropriately for our given
gender.]{.underline}** It is not possible to fully escape this; in this
society capitalist gender roles are an objective reality. Even rejecting
capitalist gender norms means reacting to, and therefore being affected
by, those norms. It is not possible to prescribe exactly how human
relations, including the role of gender, would flower in the future when
freed from the rigid straitjackets imposed by capitalism. The role of
the working class **[The crucial issue for anyone determined to end
oppression]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is how to end capitalism and
begin to build a world that is free of oppression]{.underline}**: a
'safe space' for all. Today, just as when Marx described **[the working
class]{.underline}** as the 'grave digger of capitalism', it **[is the
key force on the planet capable of ridding us of this bankrupt
system.]{.underline}** **[Both privilege theory and intersectionality
would list social class]{.underline}** -- what they would describe as
'classism' -- **[as one form of oppression.]{.underline}** However,
**[it features as one item on a list and is often discussed in terms of
the prejudice people face because of having a working-class accent or
postcode.]{.underline}** **[The centrality of class in the structure of
society is not recognised.]{.underline}** **[The basic idea that a
Nigerian worker would have more in common with a worker in
Britain]{.underline}** or the US **[than]{.underline}** they would
**[with Aliko Dangote]{.underline}**, the only African to make it on to
the list of the richest 85 on the planet, **[would not be
understood.]{.underline}** The fact that it is the working class that is
ultimately responsible for the creation of the capitalists' profits and
that by collective action it is capable of bringing capitalist society
to a halt is discounted as outmoded. Yet **[the working class is not
'disappearing'.]{.underline}** In fact, **[it is potentially stronger
today than it was at the time of the Russian Revolution.]{.underline}**
Many countries where workers were a tiny minority of society a century
ago now have large and powerful working classes. In the economically
advanced countries, like Britain, deindustrialisation has meant that the
industrial working class is much smaller. However, there still remain
groups of workers with enormous power to bring society a halt when they
strike -- anyone who lives in London and witnessed the recent London
Underground strikes knows that. Deindustrialisation has not led to young
people becoming 'middle class', but has forced them into low paid,
temporary work, often in the service sector. At the same time, large
sections of the population -- including teachers and civil servants --
who would have previously considered themselves middle class have been
driven down into the ranks of the working class in their living
conditions and social outlook. **[The history of the 20th century
repeatedly demonstrated the preparedness of working-class people to
fight for socialism.]{.underline}** **[However, it also demonstrated
that the capitalist class does all it can to cling to power, not least
by attempting to divide and rule by turning different sections of the
working class against each other. In recent years, there has been
increasing radicalisation and struggle globally, including revolutionary
movements.]{.underline}** Out of these, largely unsuccessful, struggles
conclusions will begin to be drawn about **[what is
necessary]{.underline}** to change society. That **[requires a mass
revolutionary movement]{.underline}**, bringing together different
sections of the working class -- with different experiences and outlooks
-- **[in a mass party with a clear programme and a determined and
accountable leadership.]{.underline}** Such a party would not be a model
of a new society, but a tool to bring it about. Nonetheless, it is
crucial that such a mass party would include in its ranks all of the
most oppressed sections of the working class and that it is a vibrant
and democratic force in which all participants feel able to express
their views. Its programme, as was the case with the Bolsheviks in
Russia, has to fight for the rights not just of the working class in
general but also for different specifically oppressed groups.
Undoubtedly, such a movement would also win the support of wide sections
of the middle class and even individuals from the capitalist class who
saw the need for a break with capitalism. This would particularly
include those who suffer oppression under capitalism and who recognise
that the only way to end homophobia, racism or women's oppression is to
join the struggle for a new society. Struggle itself unifies **[It would
be ludicrous and deplorable to argue that those fighting their
particular oppression should hold back and 'wait' for a unified
struggle]{.underline}** of the whole working class. **[Mass struggle is
a thousand times more effective than exhortations to individuals to
change their attitudes in winning social progress.]{.underline}** It is
always the case that **[a movement has a greater chance of success if it
is able to reach out to other sections of the working
class]{.underline}**, and that therefore it is important that the
programme put forward by a particular movement attempts to do this.
However, that is in no way to suggest that any group should artificially
delaying fighting back until they, for example, convince more white or
male workers of their cause. **[Nonetheless, to permanently end racism
in the US]{.underline}**, for instance, **[will require ending
capitalism and will]{.underline}** therefore **[have to involve a
struggle uniting different sections of the working class]{.underline}**
-- black, Hispanic, Asian and white. **[This is a practical
question.]{.underline}** **[The African American
population]{.underline}**, who suffer the worst police racism, are 13%
of the population and **[will not be able to win alone. The capitalist
class will try to increase divisions]{.underline}** between different
sections of the oppressed, particularly at times of heightened struggle.
The oppressed need to increase their strength by trying to maximise
unity. The \$15 Now movement in the US, and the election of Socialist
Alternative member Kshama Sawant in Seattle, give a glimpse of the
growing possibilities in the US to build a united workers' movement.
Achieving unity does not mean downplaying the importance of combating
the specific oppressions different groups in society face. On the
contrary, it is vital that socialists campaign for the workers' movement
to fight to take up every aspect of oppression. The Socialist Party has
a proud history of doing this -- for example, spearheading the Campaign
Against Domestic Violence in the 1990s which was central to getting the
trade unions to take the issue up. Intersectionality on university
campuses in Britain has had a tendency to turn campus feminist societies
inwards, focusing on a fruitless attempt to grade degrees of oppression
rather than fighting to end it. However, many of those initially
attracted to these ideas are searching for a way to change society and
will quickly come up against the limits of identity politics in all its
forms. One small indication of this is the popularity among young people
of the film Pride, which tells the true story of Lesbians and Gays
Support the Miners (LGSM). LGSM recognised the common ground between
their struggle against the Tories and that of the 1984/85 miners'
strike. Their attempt to support the miners was not without difficulties
-- with prejudices on both sides -- but ultimately forged a real unity.
LGSM understood that a victory for the miners would have been a massive
defeat for Thatcher, the Tories and the capitalist class -- and that was
in the interests of LGBT people. They never once responded to white,
straight miners, who were often initially homophobic, by telling them to
'check their privilege'. One result of their heroic efforts was big
parts of the workers' movement wholeheartedly taking up the struggle for
LGBT liberation, including National Union of Mineworkers lodges from
across the country leading the 1985 Pride demonstration. The miners'
strike was a major event in the class struggle in Britain, but it will
be dwarfed by events that will take place in the future against the
background of a crisis-ridden capitalism trying to drive the living
standards of the majority into the dirt. **[For some intersectionalists
it will require witnessing the power of the working class in action in
order for them to draw the conclusion that the route to ending their
specific oppression is not as part of fragmented separate groupings but
by throwing their lot in with the class struggle. However, growing
numbers of young people, particularly when they become active in
concrete struggles, are already being attracted to socialist ideas as
the only way to achieve real liberation for all humanity.]{.underline}**

### Toxicity/Time Link

#### Their analysis is a palliative used to avoid a material resistance against capitalism -- You should reject the comforting thought of the apocalypse that only culminates in an individual withdrawal from politics in exchange for the possibility of a class struggle 

**Noys 2016 (**Benjamin, Professor of Critical Theory at the University
of Chichester, TIME'S CARCASS: DE-FETISHISING TOXIC TIME,
<http://non.copyriot.com/times-carcass-de-fetishising-toxic-time/>**)**

Of course, such [an image can be oddly comforting]{.underline}. [The
toxicity of time, its intractable horror, **can feed** an apocalyptic
imagination and an apocalyptic **jouissance**]{.underline} -- to adapt
Jameson's too-often repeated line: **[we can more easily enjoy the end
of the world than we can enjoy the end of capitalism]{.underline}**.
[Toxic time, in its own way, promises an end to time, an entry into a
timeless time, even if that is now conceived as hell.]{.underline} [It
**relieves** us of the burden to deal with our times, to **engage** with
our times, it **licenses** the projected disorder of the beautiful soul,
which **projects** its madness onto the world only to find that
**rebounds** at the **expense** of the subject]{.underline}. In this way
[our interiority is temporarily preserved in the face of a fallen
exterior]{.underline}, but [only at the **cost** of a **revelation** of
the interior as madness, as contaminated and toxic.]{.underline} The bad
image of time, the image of toxic time, of time as unalterable and
intractable, is true to a certain lived experience. This is evident if
we consider two dominant images of time from our moment. The first is
the time of High-Frequency Trading (HFT), a time that is so fast,
measured in milliseconds, that it is beneath human perception. This is
time rendered at its most abstract and inhuman, time that is
inaccessible to us. But this is also time that is deeply material -- all
the cable, server farms, coolant, tunnels drilled through mountains,
microwaves, etc. It is also time that is deeply accessible in all the
effects it has on us -- on the mortgage, the wage, the retooling of the
social, the destruction of welfare, the enactment of precarity. If the
actions and demands of the market are naturalised as the weather of our
time (le temps in French), reported on the TV news shortly before the
weather forecast, we live in a similar placatory relation to the market.
The other bad image of time, most obviously, is that of anthropogenic
climate change. Once again it seems to operate out-of-step with our
perception. While anthropogenic it remains, ironically, "beyond" our
control. This time that is so slow, unfolding somehow beneath our
perception, the inverse image to the speed of HFT. [It is also a time
that suddenly speeds-up, a catastrophic time; a time which has already
happened, but is only happening "now]{.underline}". Once again[, the
effects are material, in their origin and ongoing effects, from carbon
extraction to the toxic belt of radioactivity in the upper atmosphere,
from the techno-fossils, most notably plastics, to the creeping rise of
sea levels.]{.underline} The effects, while cryptic (can we put any
particular climatic event down to climate change?), are again legible
and material: from all the predictive indicators that write our future
as one of ongoing disaster, to rising sea-levels and temperatures, and
the continual rendering into value of our own demise. Here [nature is
de-naturalised as a weapon turned against us, legible as the gun to our
head]{.underline}. These two forms of time -- at once too-fast and
too-slow -- operate as the realisation of the toxic image of time. [They
provide us with the **comfort** that there is **nothing we can do**
about time, that time is off the rails, and that it is mere fantasy that
we can have any traction on time]{.underline}. **[The truth of this is
also the lie.]{.underline}** The truth is this is our situation, but
[the lie is that the fetishisation of time as beyond our control, as out
of control, merely serves to fuel the **abstraction** of time as a time
of abstraction]{.underline}. The first step in understanding the present
regime of time is to grasp that we are left with a time-image that
serves to put us out of time. Augustine struggled, in his Confessions,
with the problem of time and of the metric that would render time
legible. It would finally be the mind that would be the measure of time.
[The extreme images of abstraction, of time as imperceptibly digital and
imperceptibly geological, leave us in an illegible time, out of our
minds: "their heart fluttereth between the motions of things past and to
come, and is still unstable,"]{.underline} as Augustine says. [Capital,
the nation, and the state each resolve the Augustinian problem of the
measure of time: capitalism's rendering of all time as value, the
nation's constitution of time as an imaginary diachronic "depth", and
the state's synchronisation of time as a bounded and legalised
entity]{.underline}. The real abstraction of value that is imposed on us
in the experience of labour and in the absence of labour -- considering
the time of unemployment is still a time subject to value, to the
absence of value -- are sites where our experience of time could be
rendered legible. [The daily apocalypse of time is our time**, the time
we have to struggle with and against**.]{.underline} This is, of course,
lived as a radically individualised time, the time that falls on us and
for us, the time we must manage efficiently, we must ensure is committed
value, which will leave us with enough to live on, to survive, whatever
happens. [If time has lost its legibility its collective dimension is
also lost, or refigured as a community of disaster and degradation, **a
toxic communal experience from which we are encouraged to flee into our
own time, our private time, the last haven in a heartless
world**]{.underline}**.**To have done with the judgement of time; to
have done with the lamentation of time, with the complaint of time, is
to start to reject the image of time as pure toxicity. [If time is only
toxic, if all time has gone bad, then we are left revelling in the bad
times to which we can only add some more toxicity]{.underline}. **[We
must reject the fetish of time as irredeemably toxic, as contaminated,
to grasp the contradictory experience of time subject to the violent
forces of abstraction that generate "our time]{.underline}**". **[A new
image of time must be sought, in the struggles against the times
rendered as the all-encompassing toxicity of capitalist and state
time.]{.underline}**

the structure, making it possible for millions of ordinary people to
better see the workings of capitalism and their effects on daily lives.
During moments of crisis, the system is challenged more than usual.
Universities are a part of the system]{.underline}**. They experience
the crisis of the overall system. **[The university becomes a battle
ground of ideas which contradict each other. Ideas which directly
represent ruling class interests, ideas which seek to reproduce the

to be critical of the system but who are effectively cushions for, and

anti-scientific as well. The attitude of modern day liberals supports
the fact that there is a connection between materialist-scientific
approach and socialist thinking, i.e. the latter requires the former,
and that if one is not scientific, one will not be socialistic. Much of
this trend is blindly insensitive to the workings of capitalism. **[What
do Marxist academics do then? Marxists]{.underline}** must uphold
principles of democracy and collegiality. They **[must maintain a
consistently critical attitude to 'identity thinking and
politics']{.underline}**, one that is **[based on social oppression in
abstraction from class issues and that divides the working class and
preserves capitalism]{.underline}**. With their students, Marxist
teachers must demand an education system which promotes the spirit of
scientific understanding of nature and society and respects academic
freedom. They must demand an education system which freely trains
artists, poets and writers, many of whom will correctly and fearlessly
register the sufferings, dreams, desires and struggles of the ordinary
working men, women and children, and the classes and groups which hold
them in chains. They must demand an education system that is driven by a
curiosity to know why things happen, so we can know what might happen,
under certain plausible conditions, so we can take action now to ensure
things happen to serve our material, political and cultural interests.
They must make a demand on society to provide high quality education for
free. **[The demand must be for a system which is without the control of
big business, which freely appropriates the fruits of research conducted
in the academic labs and which benefits from students who are being
trained to work in factories and offices for a meager wage without most
of them questioning either what they are doing at work or the nature of
society itself they are living in.]{.underline}**

**[Eduardo Valle, former advisor to the Mexican attorney general, stated
in 1995 that the drug industry had become "driving forces, pillars even,
of our economic growth.]{.underline}**"273 **[The US Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) estimates that the illicit drug industry has earned
Mexico between \$30 billion and \$50 billion in profit annually for the
last twenty years]{.underline}**.274 The industry is often said to be
second only to oil in its earning capacity for Mexico; its profits may
exceed the oil industry, but no official numbers exist to compare the
two.275 **[The rise of corporatism in the United States has developed
slowly over time; eventually, the "so-called revolving door" that
characterized relationships between government and business was replaced
by an "archway"; in the context of disaster response, entire industries
have "set up shop inside the government."]{.underline}**276 The
revolving door between cartels and the Mexican state, in the context of
drug trafficking, became an archway in the 1990s, when direct
participation by Mexican government actors in the drug business
accelerated substantially.277 **[Drug cartels function like other
businesses in certain aspects of their structure and in their need for
some level of cooperation from the state in order to prosper. The common
workers in the drug trade, the sellers and smugglers, are largely made
up of individuals with few socio-economic opportunities, who, upon
entering the drug business, deal with an "unpredictable career that
often leads to prison, death, or ruin."]{.underline}**278 **[Trafficking
organizations are at least partially hierarchical
structures]{.underline}**,279 **[and, similar to other capitalist
businesses, the lowest members make relatively little profit while the
upper echelons may accumulate startling levels of
wealth]{.underline}**.280 **[In order to maintain control of
transportation routes, cartels require a certain amount of cooperation
from the police, military, and government officials]{.underline}**.281
The most powerful cartel in a given area receives law enforcement
protection.282 In some respects, local government and law enforcement
may not have a lot of choice in deciding whether to cooperate with drug
traffickers. From January to October 2010, eleven municipal mayors were
killed in Mexico---more than one death of an elected official per
month.283 The killings are assumed to have been committed by criminal
organizations to intimidate the government.284 They likely occurred
either because the local governments began refusing to facilitate cartel
activities or because the governments began to impede the activities of
the cartels. **[Either way, the deaths imply that cartels need the
government to cooperate in order to do their business, and that they are
prepared to obtain that cooperation through any means
necessary.]{.underline}**285 El Sicario, an anonymous ex-employee of the
drug business, maintains that all of the law enforcement academies in
Mexico have been used as training grounds by the cartels.286 Students
learn how to handle weapons, recognize faces, pursue people in an urban
chase without losing them, and conduct surveillance, all of which are of
use to the cartels.287 El Sicario recounts his own story of working for
the cartels from the time he began training with the police, explaining
that fifty of the two hundred students he graduated with were already on
the payroll of a drug trafficking organization.288 The "explosion of
violence" in recent years has not slowed the drug trade. In fact, El
Sicario suggests that "the atmosphere of unrestrained violence acts as a
smokescreen for the real business and that the money flow is now better
than ever."289 Additionally, workers economically displaced in the wake
of NAFTA have begun growing illicit drugs, supplying the cartels with
merchandise. As a result of the free-trade agreement, "\[b\]y 2007 a
kilo of illicit drugs could get a price 300 times higher than a kilo of
maize; a kilo of marijuana or poppies was worth more than a ton of
beans."290 The number of hectares dedicated to growing poppies
eventually outnumbered those which are dedicated to growing maize.291 By
all accounts, the cartels have not suffered in the midst of NAFTA and
the militarization of Mexico's war on drugs, nor has the presence of
narco-corruption diminished.

### Institutions Link

#### Focus on micro-level institutions inevitably circumscribes solutions within capitalism -- conditions urban violence and turns case, only a macro-analysis of transnational capital can solve

**Smolski 16** (Andrew R. Smolski; Andrew R. Smolski is a doctoral
candidate in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at North
Carolina State University; June 27 2019; "Book Review Class Struggle and
Violence in Latin American Cities";

Violence is a chronic problem in many parts of Latin America and the
Caribbean, especially in urban settings, which have expanded over the
twentieth and twentyfirst centuries. In 2017, 80.34 percent of the
region's population lived in urban areas. At the same time, the region
contains 8 out of 10 of the most violent cities in the world (Koonings
and Kruijt, 2015). This startling number is based on the homicide rate,
which in 2014 was 66.87 per 100,000 for Honduras, 62.42 in El Salvador,
and 27.92 for Colombia (UNODC, 2019). (In the Southern Cone the number
was much lower \[for Chile, 3.62\].) Even more, Peter Imbusch, Michel
Misse, and Fernando Carrión (2011) state that for every homicide there
are a further 20--40 nonfatal violent attacks. This violence is a
regional social problem that most negatively impacts the most vulnerable
populations. In Violence and Resilience in Latin American Cities, edited
by Kees Koonings and Dirk Kruijt, and Cities, Business, and the Politics
of Urban Violence in Latin America, by Eduardo Moncada, scholars explore
the reasons for it. **[The contributors to the former focus on the
concepts of fragility and resilience, while the latter adopts an urban
political economy framework in relation to armed territorial control.
Seeking to problematize a popular homogenizing narrative of violence in
Latin America and the Caribbean that overrelies on macro-trends by
focusing on institutions, these researchers find evidence for specific
causes---social inequality and its spatial distribution, social
exclusion, institutional failure, the proliferation of criminal
organizations, and symbolic stigmatization---and a possible solution,
participatory governance. They point to a set of mechanisms that produce
criminogenic environments: corrupt policing and politicians, social
exclusion, social inequality, and concentration of poverty (Bobea, 2015;
Koonings and Kruijt, 2015). These are processes that drive the systemic
breakdown whereby a low-violence stable state can be
disrupted.]{.underline}** As Moncada points out, the necessary and
contingent mix of characteristics makes a social order conducive to
criminal organizations that can institutionalize their own rules,
delegitimize the state, and break the monopoly on the "legitimate" use
of violence. This tends to be true where a criminal organization
maintains a monopoly of armed territorial control over a given area and
the government competes against a dominant business sector that is not
cohesive with other parts of the business community. By disaggregating
the data from national trends to specific municipalities, these scholars
show that urban violence has a distinctive, stratified geography.
Certain cities have higher (e.g., Guatemala City) or lower (e.g.,
Quetzaltenango) homicide rates than the national average (Vilalta,
Castillo, and Torres, 2016), and within cities violence is concentrated
in certain areas. In San José, Costa Rica, the construction of informal
housing segregated the population by income and access to social
services, public infrastructure, and markets, and these deficiencies
were compounded by the social exclusion of the Nicaraguan migrant
community, whose legal status in the country was precarious (Gamboa,
2015). Together, institutional and material exclusion produced a
situation in which parts of the population were denied resources and
opportunity, thus increasing rates of crime. With segregation, violence
is territorialized, and zones can become controlled by criminal
organizations that then utilize violence to coerce consent. Wim Savenije
and Chris van der Borgh (2015) show how San Salvador, El Salvador, reels
from a pandilla (gang) violence that breaks the city into territories
controlled by different groups exercising control over movement and
levying punishment for perceived infractions. The gangs have produced
informal institutions that challenge the legitimacy of the state and the
rule of law, both of which are key to maintaining low levels of violence
in the current social order (Auyero and Berti, 2015). Similarly, the
dons in Kingston, Jamaica, have developed a "garrison politics" based on
clientelist relationships, meting out "justice," controlling the flow of
public investment, and ensuring constituents for political parties
(Jaffe, 2015). Thus, a parallel informal system exists that
delegitimizes the formal system and normalizes violence as a way to
control populations and handle disruptions of the social order. The
legitimacy of the state is also challenged by the failure of police to
follow the rule of law. In many cities, the police carry out
extrajudicial executions, harass residents, accept bribes, and otherwise
conduct illegal activities. **[It should be no surprise that when a
sample of people from Latin America and the Caribbean was asked about
trust in the police, 64.9 percent expressed little or no confidence,
with a high of 78.7 percent in Mexico and a low of 40.7 in Uruguay
(Latinobarómetro, 2017). Across many parts of the region, private
security has become a stand-in for law enforcement, effectively
privatizing malls and other commercial areas as "safe
spaces"]{.underline}** (Savenije and van der Borgh, 2015). Similar
trends reproduce the spatial segregation of violence as the wealthy
cordon themselves off in gated communities with private security or in
private plazas while residents without economic resources are left to
fend for themselves against both criminal organizations and corrupt
police. **[In Cities, Business, and the Politics of Urban Violence
Moncada argues that policing failures are compounded by political
corruption]{.underline}**. Corruption creates specific lacks in
infrastructure as money for public investment is either pocketed or
doled out through patronage networks to preferred business partners. The
misuse of public funds increases social exclusion, further stratifying
society. These same politicians are then directly implicated in the
reproduction of violence, as part of their corruption involves links to
criminal organizations (see also Jaffe, 2015). As a result, instead of
government there is a clientelist network operated at different times by
different parties that leverage coercion and consent to maintain their
power. Modern bureaucracy is largely placed at the service of this
network, permitting the private use of violence in the pursuit of
accumulation. This is reminiscent of a Weberian understanding of
politics as the ability to access the "external rewards . . . adventure,
victory, booty, power, and spoils" (Weber, 1946: 125). **[Despite these
important insights, what is missing from these books is the role of
violence in capital accumulation. As Mike Davis (2006) has argued, the
geographic concentration of urban misery is intertwined with cycles of
capital accumulation, with land grabs in rural areas compounded by
declining rural incomes pushing an urban population boom without the
requisite infrastructure or even a pretense of building
it.]{.underline}** Jaffe (2015) points to a similar dynamic leading to
increases in Kingston violence as structural adjustment programs fueled
rural-to-urban migration. In essence, the poor who flee transnational
capital's rural land grabs become the socially excluded poor segregated
in hotspots of insecurity and confronting urban development aimed at
accumulating capital by creating luxury and security for capitalists,
politicians, and the professional-managerial class. **[In many cases,
violence is necessary to implement specific projects for capital
accumulation, such as that seen in Mexico's drug war, which enables
extractive industry to operate, and the use of paramilitaries in
Colombia (Hristov, 2014; Paley, 2014).]{.underline}** Violence, which
causes up to an 8.4 percent reduction of the gross domestic product in
countries such as Colombia and Mexico (Buvinic, Morrison, and Orlando,
2005), ensures fear that makes employees more pliant, dispossesses
peasants of their land, and maintains the power of dominant groups. A
clear example pointed to by Moncada is Ciudad Juárez, where resources
are devoted not to confronting femicides but to protecting supply
chains. Since the 1980s, workers have migrated in search of jobs in the
export sector to Juárez, where urban development has not kept up with a
population explosion, leading to social exclusion (Eisenhammer, 2013).
Femicide has become a chronic problem as the dehumanized, exploitable
female worker has been made increasingly disposable by the North
American Free Trade Agreement's emphasis on cheap labor (Pantaleo, 2010;
Wilson, 2013). **[The transnational capitalist class has become akin to
an accomplice in murder, creating and abetting (even if unconsciously)
the conditions for femicide through increasing exploitation. Advocates
for solutions to violence such as participatory governance have to
account for this ongoing class struggle.]{.underline}** Capitalists
understand why they should not support participatory governance. Moncada
reports, for example, that the business community in Cali, Colombia,
considers it an avenue for subversive politics in marginalized
communities, and some businessmen even support the police in carrying
out social cleansing campaigns. **[Blame for the violence is readily
shifted to criminal organizations, and there are calls for police
professionalization and community input rather than recognition that a
liberal capitalist order is in part founded upon this violence. The
solution proffered functions only if the current order is what Antonio
Gramsci (1971) termed an "integral state," one that unites the political
state with civil society in carrying out a capitalist project to which
the population consents spontaneously as well as because of the threat
of violence.]{.underline}** Moncada explains that the largest declines
in violence have occurred when business, the state, and civil society
came together on terms that did not disrupt the structure of the social
system. By accepting the capitalist integral state as the goal, these
works omit difficult questions about how that state generates the
conditions that lead to violence. Problems of inequality, poverty, and
segregation are expected to be resolved by the very institutions and
classes that conjure them into existence. **[Scholarship that focuses on
the "crimes of the powerful" is more apt to provide understanding that
reliance on capitalist hegemony, while perhaps initially conducive to
reduction in crime, is in the long run criminogenic (Patten, 2019). Such
scholarship is rooted in Marxist and critical theories that address how
a set of relationships forms a structure that advantages certain groups
over others through their capacity to exploit labor in order to
accumulate capital and wealth (Lasslett, 2010). When we abstract
institutions and individuals from the structures in which they are
embedded, we begin to treat the root of the problem atemporally and
maintain the conditions that will, sooner or later, lead to another
cycle of heightened violence. These are thorough works of scholarship
that provide important qualitative and quantitative evidence of what
causes concatenations of interpersonal harm at the local level (Auyero
and Berti, 2015). Rather than offering a black-box explanation in terms
of macro-level trends, they demonstrate how local-level institutions and
access to resources affect the geography of violence. Where they falter
is in circumscribing solutions within the system, capitalism, that
conditions urban violence. While an integral state reduces harm, it does
not overcome the contradictions caused by a hierarchy of exploitation
based on the commodification of labor.]{.underline}** Future research
should include case comparisons of integral states and violence
reduction to examine whether the relation holds in other places and how
long integral states can last.

### Necropolitics Link

#### Sovereignty is an insufficient frame for understanding and locating violence -- their necropolitics denies necrocapitalism, the way nongovernmental actors control and manipulate class and labour relations to reproduce control

**Bannerjee '08** (Bobby Bannerjee is a Dean at Cass Business School;
"Necrocapitalism";
<https://sci-hub.tw/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840607096386>)

'Trade must be driven and maintained under the protection and favor of
your own weapon. Trade cannot be maintained without war, nor war without
trade. The times now require you to manage your general commerce with
your sword in your hands.' Jan Coen, Governor General, Dutch East Indies
Company, 1775. **[In 1757 the English East India Company fought a battle
with French forces, capturing the fort of Chandannagar in the province
of Bengal. Several hundreds were killed and thousands
injured]{.underline}**. **[When news of the capture reached London, the
company's stock price rose 12% in the London stock exchange. In December
2004, the share price of Armor Holdings, a US-based multinational
corporation and one of many private military subcontractors in Iraq,
reached an all-time high in Wall Street after the US government
announced reconstruction contracts in Iraq]{.underline}** (Singer 2004).
How are we to theorize these two events occurring nearly 250 years
apart? War profiteering is too simple an explanation. Both events are
markers of a colonial encounter and the political fact of the end of
direct colonialism in Iraq in 1932 and its subsequent 'sovereignty'
makes no difference whatsoever. **[Both cases involve military power,
violence, and the taking of life. Both cases also involve specific
capitalist relations of accumulation in what was a chartered corporation
of the 1700s and its evolution to the multinational corporation of the
1900s.]{.underline}** Both cases are examples of corporate colonialism
where the internal governance mechanisms of states were disrupted and
controlled by a corporate imperial center. The above quote is from a
memo Jan Coen wrote to his staff after being appointed as Governor
General for the Dutch East Indies Company. **[Coen offers a prescription
on how to manage trade during the glory days of what was probably the
world's first multinational corporation -- I refer of course to the
infamous East India Company. In an era of European colonial expansion,
the company was engaged in conquering markets, eliminating competition,
securing cheap sources of raw material supply, building strategic
alliances: in short, everything management textbooks tell us to do 200
years later.]{.underline}** **[The colonial expansionist practices of
the British empire in the 1800s involved both capital appropriation and
permanent destruction of manufacturing capacities in the colonies -- the
'technological superiority' of the British textile industry, for
example, was established as much by invention as by a systematic
destruction of India's indigenous industry, including some innovative
competitive strategies that involved cutting off the thumbs of master
weavers in Bengal, the forced cultivation of indigo by Bihar's peasants
as well as the slave trade from Africa that supplied cotton plantations
in the US with free labor (Dutt 1970; Shiva 2001: 34).]{.underline}**
Private capital operated British and Dutch colonial empires in Asia for
more than 200 years and the enabling conditions of wealth creation for
Company and Empire often included violence, slavery, torture, and death
(Hansen and Stepputat 2005). In this article I explore the implications
of 'managing general commerce with a sword' in today's global economy.
Drawing on the works of Agamben (1998, 2005) and Mbembe (2003) **[I
develop the notion of necrocapitalism based on Achille Mbembe's concept
of necropolitics, which he defined as 'contemporary forms of subjugation
of life to the power of death' (Mbembe 2003: 39). I argue that some
contemporary capitalist practices contribute to dispossession and 'the
subjugation of life to the power of death' in a variety of contexts, for
example in the organization and management of global violence through
the increasing use of privatized military forces and conflicts over
resources between transnational corporations and indigenous
communities.]{.underline}** **[If the symbol of past sovereignty was the
sword, I want to examine the effects of the sword of commerce and its
power to create life worlds and death worlds in the contemporary
political economy]{.underline}**. The fundamental question I explore in
this paper is what practices in contemporary capitalism result in the
subjugation of life? The paper is structured as follows: first, I
describe the theoretical basis of necrocapitalism, drawing on Agamben's
notion of states of exception and Mbembe's concept of necropolitics.
Second, I describe some contemporary forms of organizational
accumulation that involve dispossession and death and could therefore be
described as necrocapitalist practices -- for example, the impact of the
resources industry in developing countries and the privatization of war
and the military. I conclude by discussing some possibilities of
resistance and outlining directions for future research.

#### Their analysis neglects the strategic use of racialization by capital to render bodies superfluous and outside of the circuit of capital. Even if their framing explains the power of life over death in the context of race they cannot explain the structural processes that produce and maintain race as a function of capital.

**McIntyre '11** (McIntyre is a Doctor of Philosophy from the University
of Cambridge; "Bio(necro)polis: Marx, Surplus Populations, and the
Spatial Dialectics of Reproduction and Race"; pg. 3-4)

Historically, the necropolis was borne through displacements,
enclosures, and containments, both in the context of slavery, the colony
and (initially) the nation-state, albeit to vastly differing
geographical degrees. Dispossession has preceded capital accumulation
everywhere. 8 The enclosures of England turned the peasantry into an
agricultural (and later industrial) wage-labor force, whereas the
conquest of Ireland dispossessed the Irish of most of the best land in
favor of English (and to a lesser degree Scottish) landlords, thereby
creating a diaspora of Irish wage-laborers. Later waves of colonization
would repeat Irish dispossession on a global scale**[.9 In the southern
USA the plantation system likewise served to enclose, displace, and
capture, its racist topography and consequent misery rejuvenated during
the Clinton era (Woods 1998).]{.underline}** **[The authors in this
collection trace accumulation through dispossession into the present,
whether in the Thai--Burma border zone around Mae Sot (Arnold and
Pickles this issue), the IT parks and corridors in Delhi and Bangalore
(Gidwani and Reddy this issue), or the Dominican--Haitian borderlands
(Werner this issue).]{.underline}**10 **[Accumulation through
dispossession is often glossed as "development" (Rodney 1972). Lack of
industry can be, and often is, coded as a racial characteristic, a way
of marking necropolitical subjects as inherently wasteful and stagnant
(surplus), in need of colonial (or neo-colonial) coercion to make them
productive (see Gidwani 2008: ch 1).]{.underline}** As an example,
Gidwani and Reddy (this issue) show how the colonial authorities of
British India coded any land not immediately in agricultural production
as "waste", left unimproved by an insufficiently industrious Indian
population. The land settlements of British India simultaneously
determined property rights in land and the colonial state's revenue
rights from that land. Though these land settlements varied from one
province (and sometimes even one district) to the next, they were
invariably constructed around and justified by discourses that
privileged the population represented as best suited to "improve" this
"waste" land and put it to productive (and therefore taxable) use (see
also Guha 1963). We also see this in Britain's early-nineteenth-century
fashioning of the concept of terra nullius, a legal device where lands
not belonging to any modern (European) sovereign nation were seen as
wastelands best brought into productivity through foreign occupation
(Borch 2001). **[The racial marking of lands and bodies continues to be
a way of rendering certain bodies superfluous: Arnold and Pickles (this
issue) note that the Burmese laboring bodies in Thailand are paid less
than half the Thai minimum wage, while simultaneously being represented
as a racial threat to the Thai national body; Werner (this issue) notes
the denigratory racialization of Haitian laborers by Dominican managers
in the Ouanaminthe special economic zone (SEZ) along the Haiti--
Dominican Republic border---and this between populations that, in the
biopolis, are equally denigrated as African; while Merrill (this issue)
shows how the racial cheapening of African industrial workers in
northern Italy has allowed southern Italians to re-imagine themselves as
white and for all Italians to re-imagine themselves as ethnically
unified. In]{.underline}** **[the USA, such cheapening qua racialization
has long taken place in the context of African American, Mexican
American, and Mexican migrant lives (eg de Oliver 2004, 2001; Gilmore
2007; Mitchell 1996; Pulido 1996; Woods 1998, 2010) as well as the lives
of other such diverse groups as the Chinese, Japanese, southern
Italians, Irish, Greeks, and "Arabs".]{.underline}**11 Whereas
capitalists attended, however inadequately, to the problem of biological
and social reproduction in the biopolis, no such concern extended to the
necropolis. So long as surplus laboring populations were sufficiently
large, little regard was given to the symbolic or practical course of
local reproduction. Thus the populations of the Americas were largely
extirpated (primarily, though not exclusively, through disease) with
those remaining frequently subjected to coercive labor regimes such as
encomienda. **[Even as the indigenous population shrank, the Spanish and
Portuguese changed their treatment of indigenous persons but little,
turning instead to the transatlantic slave trade to meet their
continuing labor needs. Whether purchased or conquered, then,
necropolitical subjects were rendered a free gift of nature to be taken
and used at will.12]{.underline}** Motherhood became an externality, the
costs of which were to be absorbed by subaltern networks of caring labor
within and beyond the household and on marginal lands allowed workers
for purposes of reproduction. The necropolis consequently experienced
the wasting of bodies and lands without measure (Davis 2001; Mbembe
2003; Winant 1994). Werner, Yates, and Hudson (this issue) all refer to
Melissa Wright's exemplary study, Disposable Women and Other Myths of
Global Capitalism (2006), which shows how factories in the export zones
of Mexico and China use up the laboring capacity of women in highly
accelerated and calculated fashion. Arnold and Pickles (this issue) call
attention to the unregistered and therefore unprotected migrant laborers
of Mae Sot who endure "**[precarious employment without clear-cut
employment contract or social protection", all for a wage of scarcely
more than \$2 per day.]{.underline}** Gidwani and Reddy (this issue)
paint a Dickensian portrait of the "squalid" conditions in the slums of
Bangalore and Delhi. **[Merrill (this issue) reports the insouciance
with which "the Italian public watches television news report of the
bodies and body parts of dark skinned immigrants being lifted out of the
seas".]{.underline}** **[From the colonial past to the neoliberal
present, the lives of necropolitical subjects have been wasted through
forms of racialized hyper-exploitation determined via a calculus
of]{.underline}** **[death.]{.underline}** **[Race has become the final
arbiter of waste and wastage. F]{.underline}**acilitated by geographical
estrangement from the biopolis, little heed is paid to the needs of
labor to reproduce itself. Instead, the over-riding concern is to
subject workers to the most accelerated form of exploitation possible to
optimize profit.

### Policing Link

#### The affirmative's focus on police militarization shifts the question from capitalism to policy, resting solutions in the rehabilitation of policing reinforces violent securitization and prevents radical organizing against the police state 

**McMichael 16** (Christopher McMichael; Christopher McMichael has a PhD
in Politics from Rhodes University, South Africa and recently completed
a research fellowship at the University of The Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg. His current research interests include organised crime,
Libertarian Marxism and resistance to the resurgence of Fascism.;

Accessed 7/28/2019)

Police, war and capitalism **[Historically, liberals have praised the
spontaneity of the market, in contrast with the 'artificial, violent
constructivism' of other societies, and presented this as a virtuous
cycle where economic freedom regulates and reduces the need for state
intervention]{.underline}** (Losurdo 2011: 283). On one level,
liberalism is a political philosophy in which peace and freedom are seen
to be the end historical goals of the extension of market order. But
this discourse of emancipation has been historically tangled with
dis-emancipation in which violent policing operations to contain the
dangerous classes and foreign barbarians are the mechanisms for
extending peace (Losurdo 2011: 286, 342). **[Therefore, the precondition
for liberty and the pursuit of rational self-interest is the extension
of police and war power. Rather than being primarily focused on liberty,
liberalism is thus a politics of security, concerned with reshaping
individuals, groups and territories in the image of capital (Neocleous
2008: 5).]{.underline}** It is in this pursuit of security in the name
of liberty that the most authoritarian tendencies of liberalism become
apparent, from police killings to the revival of torture and indefinite
detention. **[The danger is not therefore that liberal states can become
more like fascist ones through 'police militarization', but rather that
security politics reveal the fascist or authoritarian tendencies within
liberal democracy already (Neocleous 2008: 9).]{.underline}** In turn,
this entails a particular situation where the continual expansion of
intrusive police powers has historically been justified in terms of
protecting individual freedom, while in practise encouraging despotic
power in the protection of economic interests. For example, during the
Cold War, the US government provided training and financial support to
repressive police forces throughout the world, many which regularly
engaged in torture and murder, in the name of fighting totalitarianism
(Kuzmarov 2012). A similar process can be observed today when
anti-democratic extensions in police and military power are legitimated
as measures against anti-democratic extremism. Recent scholarship has
focused on the idea of 'war: police assemblages' evident in
'contemporary liberal interventionism', such as in the combination of
clandestine drone attacks and special force interventions, full scale
military invasions and counter-insurgency which have characterised
recent wars in the Middle East and beyond (Bell 2015). **[But as Ryan
(2013: 441) points out the history of policing indicates that these
current assemblages are not a recent phenomenon -- 'policing arrives
once the condition for order have been violently established by the
military so that reason of state can be implemented. Policing is the
continuation of military actions by other means'. Viewed as continuum or
assemblage, even a cursory survey highlights the extent to which the
police have been central to the disciplining and oppression of the
domestic enemies of liberal states.]{.underline}** To give just a few
examples, by the end of the 18th century, police forces in Europe were
engaged in regular manhunts to round up beggars and vagrants (Chamayou
2012: 81), while across the Atlantic, the millions of Africans forced
into bondage in the Americas were kept in line with slave patrols, which
scholars are now increasingly viewing as one of the key forerunners of
modern US policing (Hadden 2003). The police were also at the forefront
of state efforts to control 'free labour' through the suppression of
strikes and revolts in the workplace. To give the example of just one
country, the police were key agents in the 'strikes (which moved)
towards miniature civil wars between workers and the state' during
periods of intense labour militancy in the United States (Brecher 1972:
236). However, this history is regularly omitted in contemporary
discussions of police militarization. An illustrative quote, worth
citing in full is from an interview conducted with Radley Balko (2013b)
by the popular Vice website during which he details a version of (US)
police history, in which The Founders were quite wary of standing armies
and the threat they pose to liberty. They ultimately concluded --
reluctantly -- that the country needed an army for national defense. But
they most feared the idea of troops patrolling city streets -- a fear
colored by much of human history, and more immediately by the antagonism
between British troops and residents of Boston in the years leading up
to the American Revolution. The Founders could never have envisioned
police as they exist today. And I think it's safe to say they'd have
been absolutely appalled at the idea of a team of police, dressed and
armed like soldiers, breaking into private homes in the middle of the
night for the purpose of preventing the use of mind-altering drugs. What
Balko omits is the question of how war and police power were deployed
against groups considered as undeserving of liberty by the 'founders':
slaves, American Indians, African slaves, the property-less and women.
The violent economy of chattel slavery and oppression of indigenous
peoples gained their political force from the police power. Indeed, in
the heroic age of liberty conjured by Balko, the Founders were in fact
prepared to use military force to suppress internal revolt, such as in
the case of the 1794 rebellion against the Whiskey Tax by farmers in
Pennsylvania in which Alexander Hamilton led troops against the revolt
(Zinn 1995: 100). **[Tracing the history of the police power and not
just 'the police', Markus Dubber (2005) writes of the ways that the
'Founders' retained the notion of unlimited and undefinable police
powers that operated in England.]{.underline}** He writes, 'Ending the
king's police power, it turns out, did not mean ending police power
altogether ... Americans didn't appreciate being policed, but they had
no qualms about policing' (p. 83). **[The policing of imperialism
occurred in tandem with the foundation of modern police forces in
Europe, but crucially this linkage was played down at the
time.]{.underline}** In the case of Britain, for instance, the creation
of the police was influenced by experiments with colonial warfare in
Ireland, albeit framed very differently: While the discourse for police
advocacy for Ireland explicitly invoked the need for a paramilitary
police under the spectre of 'real or suspected insurrectionary
conspiracies', the militaristic character of policing could not enter
the discourses of advocacy in the metropolis (Williams 2003: 231).
**[This occurred in a context in which Atlantic political thinkers and
the administrators in the late 18th and 19th centuries began to call for
a professionalized body of standing police officers, capable of both
managing the potential threats posed by growing proletariats in the
metropole and the colonies and protecting production (Williams 2003).
The military was not a practical institution to govern emerging
capitalist societies: alternating as it does between no intervention and
the most drastic and violent procedures. The newly emerging police, in
contrast, could penetrate civil society in a way impossible for military
formations, less to crush disorder in the form of riots (though it also
came to do that of course) and more to fabricate an order in which such
disorder did not occur.]{.underline}** (Neocleous 2000: 78) The liberal
demand for order was therefore not about so much reducing the threat of
arbitrary military power, but rather of ensuring a more thorough
policing of civil society, which was regularized and comprehensive
(Silver 1965). In practise, however, the differences between the
military and police was often more a question of degrees than of
fundamental divergences of function, especially evident in colonies. In
the case of South Africa, for instance, 'the military feature of
policing' was dominant -- both in terms of the institutional history of
serving as an 'internal army of occupation' and in the usage of police
formations as military units during war-time (Brogden 1989: 3).
Throughout the British Empire, there are similar examples of military
forces gradually developing into police institutions. The point which
derives from these examples is that the dual historical formation of the
nation-state and capitalism saw military and police forces enrolled in
shared projects of conquest and control. These different forces were
joined as part of the machinery of State -- 'armies of wars of colonial
pacification, international competition and domestic repression'
(Robinson 1983: 20). However, this is not to argue that the police are
interchangeable with the military. Instead, they are able to conduct
internal operations in a far more sustained but, when considering the
historical record, often as violent a manner as military forces: As
states defined a part of their own population as an enemy, the military
learned from those who know how to locate individuals and to
'interrogate' them: the police. If military dictatorships were so
effective in suppressing all political opposition and taking thousands
of lives, if they could wage unilateral 'wars' on their own populations,
it was thanks to the 'police method' ... (Seri 2012: 118) **[Police
institutions, thus, have a distinct role in 'facilitating
authoritarianism and state violence ... that the scholarly emphasis on
"militarization" tends to ignore' (Seri 2012). The general thrust of
much of the police militarization literature has been to portray police
authoritarianism as intrinsic to non-liberal states but aberrant to
capitalist democracies. Liberal societies are understood to be policed
societies, in which the institutions work to achieve peace and
prosperity in a regulated and consistent fashion, rather than police
states, in which officers are at war with society. As argued in the
previous section, this distinction omits the pivotal role played by
police and military violence and terror in the foundation and extension
of capitalism. But this is not limited to primitive accumulation but
rather is a central, continuous process of pacification and of
fabricating order through police patrolling, surveillance and
governance. Police power is not restricted to repression of the state's
enemies but in the daily regulation of society, from administering
discriminatory labour practices and environmental practices to
penalizing the illicit economic activities of the poor. Police both
intervene in the workplace, through their involvement in strikes and
industrial disputes, and are the key instruments in enforcing social
control over the dispossessed 'underclass', who are not integrated into
the labour force.]{.underline}** In a history of class war in the United
States originally published in 1931, the journalist Louis Adamic noted
that the 'police club' was the pre-eminent symbol of capitalist power
(p. 23). Almost a century later, the police club is now accompanied by
pepper spray, tear gas, armoured vehicles and drones, but the police
still represent the main force employed by the state to attack and
control the social tensions generated by economic inequality and
exploitation -- from industrial conflict in the early 20th century to
street battles around austerity and crisis in the early 21st century. Of
course, the nature of whom and what is policed changes over time, and in
line with changes in capitalist order, from domination over nascent
industrial proletariats in the 19th century to regular campaigns of
harassment against the unemployed and migrants in the postindustrial
badlands of neo-liberalism. But even without the more high tech
accoutrements, the generic officer on the beat is nevertheless a figure
of considerable power who enforces state domination on the street, and
in particular against the 'dangerous classes'. Indeed, Mike Brown was
not gunned down in the middle of a Ferguson street by an overtly
military-inspired SWAT agent. He was gunned down by the routine patrol
officer, the state agent that is dressed in 'traditional' police attire
and driving the 'traditional' police cruiser that more closely resembles
the 'community policing solution' that so many public commentators have
posited to supplant police militarization. **[Yet, soon after the
routine execution of Brown, quickly most all of the controversy and
criticism of the police power were aimed at the use of military gear,
aesthetics, and tactics -- attention was placed steadfastly on the
spectacle of police--military repression.]{.underline}** Of course, we
are not suggesting that these developments should not be ruthlessly
critiqued. They certainly demonstrate a significant ability of the local
state to deploy maximum force. **[But here the spectacle stayed true to
its own governing logic, hiding in plain sight the equally insidious
violence of the 'good old police'.]{.underline}** Policing as
pacification **[The inability of the militarization argument to
acknowledge how a patrol officer with a nightstick may be as much of a
cause of terror and fear as the machine gun waving SWAT team unit, is
further indicator of its liberal bent.]{.underline}** Moreover, the
popular lexicon of police militarization doesn't offer any ability to
critique the police officer reading books to children at a public
school, or passing out candy during a parade, or holding 'public
forums', press conferences and 'community meetings'. **[Hence, instead
of thinking about the police/war assemblage through the notion of
militarization, it might be best to think of this through the idea of
pacification.]{.underline}** Although pacification most commonly evokes
US counter-insurgency efforts in Vietnam, the concept has a much longer
history, emerging first in the Edicts of Pacification of the mid to late
1500s, where these laws were said to be aimed at the ending of strife
and to make populations submit to state rule primarily through peaceful
methods. Drawing on Todorov (1984), Neocleous reminds us that, in 1573,
Philip II ordered that 'conquests' be renamed 'pacification', so as to
help build consent among the colonized. As Neocleous (2011) states,
**[The dates are important, since they are deep into the period of
global accumulation and the history of capital, or, in other words, the
point of departure for the period in which the insecurity of bourgeois
order had to be secured.]{.underline}** (p. 199) From here pacification
became a means of original accumulation through the colonial conquests
of the 17th century, only to be re-theorized, re-named and re-deployed
across a plethora of more contemporary colonial geographies, from French
counter-insurgency in Algeria and Indo-China, to Britain's engagements
in Malaysia, Cyprus and Kenya, to US counter-insurgencies in Vietnam.
**[Pacification is best thought of as a central strategy of the
colonialist, capitalist state as it works to secure the insecurities of
accumulation both domestically and internationally, and this lines up
with the police mandate.]{.underline}** Instead of only describing state
power as a pacification project, Neocleous (2011) argues that critical
theory should reappropriate the concept of pacification as a way of
understanding the security politics of liberal order building, as
capital works to secure accumulation and the state demands order. As a
way of thinking through the police and war assemblage as always about
the fabrication of order and productive labour, the notion of
pacification better highlights the ways that coercion and consent are
always the flip sides to the security coin. That is, it usefully
accounts for not only the excesses or spectacular forms of police
violence that the militarization thesis is rightly concerned about but
also offers a way of thinking through the routine, non-spectacular
violence of 'Officer Friendly' as well as this agents attempts of
winning 'hearts and minds'. Pacification, then, helps to keep in
constant focus the iron fist and velvet glove of police power. **[Yet,
pacification, with its evocation of counter-insurgency, colonization and
war, doesn't base its claims on making a distinction between police and
war, or peace and war, or even foreign and domestic. Pacification, then,
is not only an international, colonizing strategy as it is most commonly
discussed (i.e. colonization of Algeria, Vietnam, Malaysia, for
example), but simultaneously a way of fabricating domestic order, as
liberalism deploys the police concept in relation to domestic dangers
and threats. Police, then, at least in the domestic sense of the term,
becomes a pacifying power directed at ordering the disorderly and
possessing the dispossessed, or the 'reserve armies of labor' so central
to capitalist modernity.]{.underline}** But whether as war power or
police power, pacification is animated by the inseparable logics of
security and order, and hinges on a joint strategy of coercion and
consent. Rigakos (2011) suggests that pacification as an 'anti-security'
concept usefully gets at the heart of class struggle and the violence of
capitalist modernity, as it implies that there are subjects and
populations that refuse efforts at their pacification, which of course
is inseparable from struggles over space. To think in terms of
pacification, then, is to also ask who is being pacified and for what
reasons and objectives (Rigakos 2011). **[While the militarization
literature has highlighted the repressive impacts of the wars on drugs,
crime and terror on policing, this has primarily been understood as a
matter of error and bad policy, in which the inaccurate metaphor of war
mutates the 'true' function of policing. Understood as pacification, the
wars on drugs, crime and terror are not actually metaphors at all but
are real wars which 'slip and slide from the foreign into the domestic
and back again']{.underline}** (Neocleous 2011: 201). At different
points, for instance, the war on drugs involved military engagements in
Latin America, provided a rationale for expanded police powers and
massive growth of the prison population in the United States. **[This
logic of security is also repurposed for police and military projects
undertaken by other states. For example, the war on drugs in Mexico and
Colombia has been used to displace communities from resource rich areas,
for attacks on labour organizing and to create an environment favourable
for corporate investment (Paley 2014).]{.underline}** In post-apartheid
South Africa, police methods adopted from the US war on drugs were
incorporated into a new 'war on crime', targeting undocumented migrants
and the urban poor (Samara 2011). The exchange between war and policing
is more insidious and sophisticated than just the transference of combat
equipment into the domestic sphere, with models of population control
and public relations honed in counter-insurgency returning to the
domestic streets (Williams 2012). **[The liberal focus on establishing
the correct boundaries between war and policing is also tactically
problematic for political activism and organizing, as its shift the
critique of police power away from issues of structural oppression and
state violence into that of due process. For example, in the wake of the
2015 Baltimore uprisings following the police killing of Freddie Gray,
President Obama has promised to restrict the federal transfer of
military equipment to local police departments. But while this gives the
surface appearance of answering the radical challenges presented by
insurgent protest, it clearly does not actually address the racism and
everyday brutality which sparks revolt. Unlike more bluntly
authoritarian political system, the liberal state can incorporate
pressure for reform from below into governance in a manner that appears
to be progressive while, maintaining the ruling order.]{.underline}**
Writing in the wake of the social revolts of the 1960s, Wolfe (1971)
observed that political repression in liberal states required a great
deal of social consent, won through the agents of the state appearing to
be consistent and law abiding, and the incorporation of the discourses
and critiques raised by dissenting groups. Thus, policing in the United
States since the 1970s has combined the impulse of militarization with
community policing, in which the police are trained to be more
'sensitive' about racism and sexism (Williams 2007). Such a combination
results in a more sophisticated repression, as communities are enlisted
to collaborate with the police, while still maintaining an expanded
capacity to deploy violence. By failing to address the complex and
sophisticated mechanisms of police repression in capitalist democracies,
liberal critique ends up focusing on procedures and appearance to the
'point where ends are irrelevant' (Wolfe 1971: 34). **[The idea of
militarization takes a legalistic focus on achieving the 'proper' form
of policing, a discourse which easily be co-opted by the state. At core,
it is based on a liberal frame of trying to establish appropriate
boundaries between military and police, rather than looking at how war
and police overlap and conjoin in the everyday governance of
capitalism.]{.underline}** It is focused on the apparent danger of
liberal democracies becoming more like despotic political systems while
obfuscating the fundamental violence of the liberal state. By contrast,
thinking on police violence and state repression through the concept of
pacification highlights that this is potentially already existent and
apparent within liberalism itself. **[The problem is not that liberal
democracies could become dystopic tyrannies through the negative pull of
militarization, but rather that there is already a violent social war
within capitalist society. And within this conflict, police institutions
are central mechanisms for ensuring class and racial dominance already
and have been since their founding.]{.underline}** Conclusion In an
interview, South African police commander, Jeremy Vearey (Amandla
Magazine 2013), responded to a question on the apparent
'remilitarization' of the police by arguing that Firstly let me just
demythologise for you. The police never demilitarised and remilitarised
through the sloganeering of someone. Never. Never. The structure in
terms of the military tradition of instruction was always there. A
militaristic way of doing tactical planning was always there. Do you
understand the military way of planning? You firstly see those on the
other side as an adversary. In this article, we have worked towards the
beginning of a wider demythologizing of the concept of 'police
militarization'. In our analysis, the historical conjunction between the
military and the police, the 'tradition' as described in the above
quote, is too strong to describe recent developments across the world as
a disturbing new trend. And this is not just a past facet of policing
but carries on into the present in capitalist democracies. **[Our
concern then is not that the 'militarization thesis' does not describe
real phenomena, but that it relies on an overstated and unquestioned
distinction between war and police.]{.underline}** This conceptual
separation focuses too much on differences between the different
coercive wings of the state, which disguises how social war and conflict
is central to the logic of 'internal' or 'domestic' policing. War power
and police power are best thought as not opposites, but as being always
together. **[Indeed, the ubiquity of the militarization thesis may
prevent more radical and comprehensive thinking about the connections of
the police institution to power, violence and authority. Instead of
focusing on the question of the divides between the police and military,
we should ask if state violence and repression is any less problematic
and traumatic and wrong if the officer was dressed in 'nonmilitary'
uniforms (is there such a thing as a non-militarized
uniform?).]{.underline}** Put another way, would the latter example be
any more illegitimate and unjust? We are not convinced. Both the iron
fist and the velvet glove, we suggest, have to be seen in conjunction,
on a continuum of police power, where coercion and consent are always
already together: **[the point being, the problem that we must grapple
with is the way the state claims the right in the first place to
actually arrest, kill or maim any subject, abroad and domestically, in
the name of 'security', by which we mean its own narrow, bloody
interests -- repressive killing and smiling faces in uniform that are at
once enacted as projects of pacification so that capitalist order
survives and thrives.]{.underline}**

### War on Drugs Link

#### The war of drugs did not emerge out of nowhere -- it is part of a strategic paradigm that globalizes instability in order to continue cycles of exploitation -- the aff mystifies the root of US intervention

**Paley 2014** (Dawn Paley; journalist and author of Drug War
Capitalism; July 2012; "Drug War Capitalism";

War, When Shocks Aren't Enough "This is what the beginning of
neoliberalism felt like," said Raquel Gutiérrez, reflecting on what it
is like to try and understand the ongoing war in Mexico. Now a professor
at the Autonomous University of Puebla, Raquel was an underground
militant in Bolivia in the mid-'80s when the first neoliberal policies
took effect there, pauperizing the working class. It's been 10 years
since she's returned to Mexico. Raquel pauses and drags on a cigarette,
as if trying to remember a language she's forgotten. It doesn't come.
Then she asks me if I've read Naomi Klein's book The Shock Doctrine. I
nod. Silence. "The thing is, **[in Mexico,]{.underline}** the shocks
didn't work," she says. It's not that there was a shortage of shocks.
**[Neoliberal economic policies were]{.underline}** first **[introduced
in the form of structural adjustment programs. These ended a period of
steady economic growth, import substitution industrialization, and high
oil prices known as the Mexican Miracle.]{.underline}** "From 1980 to
1991, Mexico received thirteen structural adjustment loans from the
World Bank, more than any other country," wrote Tom Barry in his 1995
book Zapata's Revenge. "It also signed six agreements with the IMF, all
of which brought increased pressure to liberalize trade and
investment."(2) In the 1980s, sometimes called the "lost decade," oil
prices collapsed along with the peso. "From over a thousand state
enterprises in 1983, the Mexican state owned around two hundred by 1993.
In 1991, the Mexican program brought in more money to government coffers
(US\$9.4 billion) than all other sales of public companies in Latin
America combined."(3) By the end of 1994, Mexico had signed on to the
North America Free Trade Agreement, witnessed the Zapatista uprising,
and undergone another major currency devaluation. But **[by the turn of
the 21st century, Mexico's territory and economy still weren't fully
open to foreign investors. "Regardless of the reforms, the performance
of the Mexican economy over the last three decades has not been
satisfactory," read a report released earlier this year by the Mexican
Central Bank.(4) Peasant and Indigenous communities continued to
exercise communal title over lands rich in resources. A large middle
class owned small businesses, and the richest Mexican families kept
control over lucrative sectors of the economy.]{.underline}** According
to the U.S. State department, Mexico's 10 richest families "are not the
only obstacle to improving competition in the Mexican economy." Pemex,
the 17th largest oil company in the world by oil reseves, remained in
state hands.(5) **[Something more than an economic shock was in order: a
comprehensive strategy proven to increase foreign direct investment. It
had to ensure that the local police and army, and eventually the entire
legal system, would operate according to U.S. standards. This strategy
is colloquially known as the war on drugs. Since]{.underline}** the
**[Nixon]{.underline}** presidency, **[the U.S.]{.underline}**
government **[has poured almost a trillion dollars(6) into the "war on
drugs"]{.underline}** in countries such as Colombia and Afghanistan.
**[Direct links between drug war policies and improving investment
climate are revealed through careful examination of U.S. engagement in
Colombia from 2000-2006. The strategy has been refined and expanded over
the past two decades through experimentation both domestically and
internationally]{.underline}**. Economics of the Colombia Model **[Plan
Colombia was a six-year anti-narcotics program jointly funded by the
United States and Colombia]{.underline}**. Non-U.S. diplomats claim that
the first draft of Plan Colombia was written in English, and later
translated to Spanish.(7) In the 11 years since Plan Colombia was
launched, **[the U.S. government has spent over \$3.6 billion on
narcotics and law enforcement initiatives. Yet the U.S. government
reports that "Colombia remains one of the world's largest producers and
exporters of cocaine, as well as a source country for heroin and
marijuana]{.underline}**."(8) A 2008 U.S. Government Accountability
Office (GAO) report on Plan Colombia found that the agreement failed to
meet its targets for reducing drug production, with the "estimated flow
of cocaine towards the United States from South America" rising from
2000-2006.(9) **[Instead of a causing a change in strategy, Plan
Colombia's failure to reduce drug trafficking and production was
minimized in favor of an emerging series of metrics linked to security
and improving the business environment.]{.underline}** Bradford Higgins,
U.S. Assistant Secretary for Resource Management, argued, "In many ways,
Colombian programs and U.S. support have evolved from our original, more
narrow focus into a comprehensive strategy that can now serve as a model
to inform efforts in other challenged or failing states."(10) Previous
U.S. efforts to enforce narcotics-related sanctions on Colombia had
negatively impacted U.S. investments. The Council of American
Enterprises --- an American business consortium in Colombia --- reported
that in 1996 its member companies lost \$875 million in sales because of
the sanctions.(11) That same year the State Department reported that the
sanctions required the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the
Export-Import Bank to freeze about \$1.5 billion in investment credits
and loans. This included a \$280 million loss to a U.S. company active
in Colombia's oil industry.(12) **[According to a report prepared by the
Colombian government, the objectives of Plan Colombia are "promoting
conditions for employment generation and social stability" and expanding
"tariff preferences in compensation for the negative effects of the drug
trade and to favor a Free Trade Agreement that will broaden employment
opportunities."(13)]{.underline}** At the outset of Plan Colombia, total
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was calculated at \$2.4 billion.(14) By
2011, Colombia's FDI stood at \$14.4 billion, the fastest growth rate in
Latin America.(15) Oil and gas make up an increasingly important portion
of FDI, increasing from around one tenth in the mid '90s to almost one
third by 2010, when it reached \$4.3 billion.(16) A decree passed in
2003 allowed for private investment in Colombia's oil sector and the
partial privatization of formerly state-owned Ecopetrol.(17) As of 2010
FDI in the mining sector (including coal mining) stood at over \$2
billion, accounting for more than half of all non-petroleum
investment.(18) In 2008, the United States Agency for Inter­national
Development (USAID) boasted that "Colombia's economic takeoff after 2003
did not happen by chance." Fifty-two areas of Colombia's economic system
were targeted for reform, and under Plan Colombia, "USAID provided
technical assistance to the \[Government\] to help it design and
implement policies ranging from fiscal reform to financial sector
strengthening to improving the environment for small businesses, and
many others."(19) This was accomplished through a combination of legal
reforms and tax breaks, the signing of new Free Trade Agreements
(between Colombia and the United States as well as between Colombia and
Canada) and the militarization of the extractive industry. U.S. trained
"energy battalions" protected pipelines, roads and other infrastructure.
A 2007 report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies(20)
claimed that Colombia "made a strong recovery...with impressive rates of
growth, reduced unemployment, increased levels of investment, expanded
trade, lower inflation, and a surge in investor confidence." These
gains, they report, "are closely linked to improved security and, in
turn, help create more jobs in the legitimate economy as an alternative
to illegal pursuits." **[From the perspective of the U.S. State
Department, Plan Colombia is not a failure. Quite the contrary: it has
allowed for the creation of an effective new model for U.S.
intervention. By 2010 Colombia's largest foreign investors were Panama
and Anguilla (a British Overseas Territory), both tax havens, followed
by the United States, England, Canada, Bermuda and
Spain.(21)]{.underline}** The language of a "comprehensive strategy,"
used to play up Plan Colombia, mirrors the official language of
counterinsurgency warfare. "\[Counterinsurgency\] is an extremely
complex form of warfare.... Achieving these aims requires synchronizing
the efforts of many nonmilitary and \[Host Nation\] agencies in a
comprehensive approach," reads the U.S. Military Counterinsurgency
Manual, released in 2006.(22) **[Even the GAO's director of
international affairs and trade,]{.underline}** in testifying be­fore the
House of Representatives**[, stated that "international programs face
significant challenges reducing the supply of illegal drugs but support
broad US foreign policy objectives."(23)]{.underline}** But as Gian
Carlo Delgado-Ramos and Silvina María Romano have noted, **[the drug war
"strategy is complex and dangerous, since it links a multiplicity of
apparently opposed legal and illegal actors who nevertheless receive
benefits in the form of increased power or wealth." At the same time it
is clear that "the exploitation of the people and of the nations' and
the region's resources deepens."(24)]{.underline}**

#### The war on drugs operates as an axis for global capitalist assault and militarized accumulation in Mexico, used as a mechanism for incarceration

**Robinson 18** (William I. Robinson, professor of sociology at UC Santa
Barbara; "Accumulation Crisis and Global Police State"; March 21, 2018;

**[Few developments]{.underline}** in recent decades, by way of example,
**[have been so functional to the global capitalist assault on the
working and oppressed peoples of the Americas]{.underline}** -- and so
illustrative of accumulation by repression -- **[than the so-called "war
on drugs." This war constitutes the axis around which the vast program
of militarized accumulation and capitalist globalization revolves in
Mexico]{.underline}**, Colombia, Central America, and **[elsewhere in
the Western hemisphere, a multi-pronged instrument]{.underline}** of the
TCC **[for primitive accumulation and capitalist globalization that
links the trans- national military--industrial--security complex with
neo-liberal reform and repression of social movements]{.underline}**
(Gilber, 2011; Hristov, 2014; Paley, 2014). And **[in the United
States,]{.underline}** as documented in Michelle Alexander's (2012)
bestseller, The New Jim Crow, **[the farcical war on drugs has been a
mechanism for the mass incarceration of surplus African American,
Chicano, and poor white labor.]{.underline}** As spin-off effects of
military spending flow through the open veins of the global economy --
that is, the integrated network structures of the global production,
services, and financial system -- it becomes increasingly difficult to
distinguish between military and non-military dimensions of a global war
economy. In this regard and crucial to the global police state is the
development of new technologies associated with digitalization and what
is now referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. The tech sector
is now at the cutting edge of capitalist globalization and is driving
the digitalization of the entire global economy (see, e.g., Srnicek,
2017). Computer and information technology (CIT) first introduced in the
1980s provided the original technological basis for globalization. In
recent years there has been another wave of technological development
that has brought us to the verge of the fourth industrial revolution,
based on robotics, 3-D printing, the Internet of Things, artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning, bio- and nanotechnology, quantum
and cloud computing, new forms of energy storage, and autonomous
vehicles. Marx and Engels (1978/1848) famously declared in The Communist
Manifesto that "all that is solid melts into air" under the dizzying
pace of change wrought by capitalism. Now the world economy stands at
the brink of another period of massive restructuring. At the heart of
this restruc- turing is the digital economy based on more advanced
information technology, on the collection, processing, and analysis of
data, and on the application of digitalization to every aspect of global
society, including war and repression. C**[IT has revolutionized warfare
and]{.underline}** the modalities of **[state-organized militarized
accumulation, including the military application of vast new
technologies and the further fusion of private accumulation with state
militarization.]{.underline}**

#### The war on drugs is used as a tool to maintain US hegemony and protect capitalism while enacting violence towards the proletariat class.

From the Treaty of Hidalgo to the War on Drugs, [the US has built and
maintains political and economic power over Mexico]{.underline}
(González 2000; Meráz-Garcia 2012; Mercille 2011; Wright 2011). Over
centuries, [imperial territorial expansion, trade relations, ongoing
privatization and dispossession of lands and livelihood, austerity
policies, and the War on Drugs reflect US imperial control over Latin
America.]{.underline} In 1971, [President Nixon declared the 'War on
Drugs,' criminalizing unemployed racial minorities in]{.underline} both
the US ('the consumers') and [Latin America]{.underline} ('the
producers') (Wright 2014). Further, t[he 9/11 attacks served as an
excuse for the US to strengthen the 'War on Drugs' via the 'War on
Terror' through enacting tougher immigration policies against Latin
American populations]{.underline} (Amoore 2006; Corva 2008). In 2006,
[with pressure and support from the US, President Calderon declared the
'War on Drugs' on his own Mexican population]{.underline}. Through the
2007 Merida Initiative [the US is providing military equipment and
training, reinforcing of the rule of law, encouraging privatization and
foreign direct investment, and militarizing local police and the
border]{.underline} (Paley 2014[). Calderon's augmentation of military
intervention to fight drug cartels by eliminating the main leaders
perpetuates further violence in communities]{.underline} like El Rancho
because, [once a drug-lord is eliminated, other drug cartels fight to
gain control over the newly vacant disputed territory and drug
route]{.underline}(s), resulting in [further armed confrontations
between the drug cartels and the military]{.underline} (Maldonado 2012).
According to Gallaher, 'An approach centered on destroying the cartels
... entails an escalation of violence and potentially more danger for
civilians' (2015, 8). Further, Paley (2014) indicates that [**this is
not a war to end drugs; it is a war on people -- specifically on the
poor, indigenous communities, and immigrants -- that increases
inequality and protects capitalism**.]{.underline} Austerity programs
resulting in [a lack of educational investment in El Rancho have
facilitated the entrance of cartels and increased violence]{.underline}.
The highest education level is Tele-secundaria (middle school via
televised lectures) with one teacher for three classrooms/grades.
Further, the most common employment in El Rancho is temporary moso (male
agrarian helper) paying \$200 PMX (\$12 USD) per day, barely enough to
buy a kilo of beef at \$150 pesos. Consequently, [several men in the
community welcomed cartel members who offered better-paid
jobs]{.underline}. Such cartel members are part of criminal
organizations -- like Los Zetas, La Familia, and Los Caballeros
Templarios. Each one of these criminal organizations has been present in
El Rancho with Caballero Templarios being the most recent. By the
mid-2000s, [El Rancho was becoming one of several disputed agrarian
communities and thus, a place of conflict and great danger for its
residents]{.underline}, including most of my participants

### 2nc Neolib RC of Drug markets

#### Neoliberal and free market capitalist policies were key to creating the rise of the drug cartels in Mexico, disassembling capitalism solves key links to cartels including wage labor and unemployment

**Mercille 11** (Julien Mercille. 2011 . "Violent Narco-Cartels or US
Hegemony? The political economy of the 'war on drugs' in Mexico". Julien
received his PhD in 2007 from UCLA (Los Angeles, USA) in Geography
(geopolitics and US foreign policy). He had previously received an MA
from the University of Kentucky (Lexington, USA) in Geography, and a BA
from McGill University (Montreal, Canada) in International Development
Studies and Political Science. In addition to his academic writing, he
am a columnist for The Sunday Business Post and The Journal.ie. Third
World Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 9, Pg. 1642-1643. ZB)

**[From the 1980s onwards four developments converged to increase
dramatically the size of the drugs industry in Mexico.]{.underline}**
Not all were related to neoliberal reforms, but the latter nevertheless
made a key contribution. First, South American cocaine had until then
been smuggled into the US via the Caribbean and Florida, but
interdiction efforts in these areas diverted the traffic through Mexico,
whose significance as transit country rose drastically. Essentially the
Colombian narco-traffickers cut a deal with the Mexican cartels to
ensure that their drugs would reach the US through Mexico rather than
through the Caribbean and Florida. Second, **[the flow of narcotics was
further magnified by the neoliberal reforms that increased commerce
across the US--Mexico border and facilitated the smuggling of large
quantities of drugs]{.underline}**. The cartels started putting
shipments of heroin, crystal meth, cannabis and cocaine on the many
trucks crossing the border.21 Third, NAFTA and neoliberal reforms have
increased the size of the drugs industry by involving more Mexicans in
it for two reasons: in order to find work and out of desperation. **[The
consequences of neoliberalisation for the majority of Mexico's
population have largely been negative. The economy grew at an annual per
capita rate of 3.5 per cent between 1960 and 1979, before
neoliberalisation, but only by 0.1 per cent in the 1980s and by 1.6 per
cent between 1992 and 2007. NAFTA has failed to generate job growth and
increase wages---the average wage in Jua´rez, for example, dropped from
\$4.50 a day to \$3.70. True, the manufacturing sector has added some
500 000 to 600 000 net jobs since NAFTA went into effect, but this has
been offset by a loss of about 2.3 million jobs in the agricultural
sector caused by cheaper imports of corn from subsidised US
agrobusinesses.]{.underline}** Farmers were forced to abandon their land
and migrate to the US or move to the cities in Mexico along the US
border, where they became cheap labour for US manufacturing businesses
(maquiladoras). Because maquiladoras mostly assemble imported components
and immediately re-export finished products, few linkages have been
generated with the Mexican domestic economy, creating few employment
opportunities. **[A related negative effect has been the rise of the
informal economy, which offers worse conditions to workers; it formed 57
per cent of the workforce in 2004, up from 53 per cent in 1992.22 As a
result, many in Mexico had little choice other than to resort to
participation in drug trafficking to supplement their income, usually
acting as low-level dealers. This mass of unemployed or underemployed in
Mexico's northern regions constituted a perfect supply of desperate
labour for the cartels.]{.underline}** The supply increased even more
around 2000, when the maquiladora industry faced competition from China
and India, which could provide lower-cost labour to make the same goods.
Some companies established in Mexico moved their production to Asia,
causing further layoffs. Finally, **[by causing significant social
dislocation and lack of employment opportunities, neoliberal reforms
increased people's recourse to drugs to alleviate their suffering,
enlarging the market within Mexico itself and contributing to the growth
of the narcotics industry]{.underline}**. Charles Bowden, a veteran
analyst of the Mexican drugs trade, observes of Jua´rez, one of the most
affected cities: 'Who in their right mind would turn down a chance to
consume drugs in a city of poverty, filth, violence, and despair?'23
Fourth, as the PRI's political monopoly started losing ground in the
late 1980s, culminating in the PAN's 2000 presidential victory,
drug-related violence increased. The traditional PRI-backed informal
arrangements in which the state regulated the flow of drugs through the
country eroded. The result has been a vacuum of power that has increased
violence, as the cartels now have to fight for their share of a newly
unstable market. Since the 1980s, drug control has been gradually
militarised by successive presidents, but the PAN's Caldero´n took such
a strategy to new levels from 2006 onwards. Alliances are now shifting
more rapidly, but it is still not difficult to reject the mainstream
view presenting the US as intervening to defend human rights and reduce
drug trafficking. As will be seen below, Washington strongly supports
the PAN government and Mexican military, responsible for countless human
rights abuses and corrupted by drugs. Moreover, it has recently been
reported that the DEA and FBI might even have paid informants among the
leaders of the Mexican cartels, who are the key narcotics traffickers
and directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. The US is also
not immune to drug trafficking itself---there are currently hundreds of
ongoing investigations into corruption among US border agents who accept
bribes or favours to let drugs across the border.24

## Israel Links

### BDS Link

#### BDS needs to be contextualized to an international analysis of class and power- despite success in raising awareness BDS relies on an imperialist system to resolve imperialism which denies radical liberation. Affirming sanctions as a tool mystifies causes of Palestinian suffering and legitimizes intra state violence and colonialism.

**Sperber 2015 (**Joshua, researcher in department of political science
and history at Averrett University, "BDS, Israel, and the World System",
published in institute for Palestine studies vol.45 no.1, autumn**)**

However, with exceptions, \[20\] **[Left analyses of Israel that employ
radical political economy are relatively rare. Many Left accounts of
Israel in fact exchange political-economic analyses for
political-cultural ones]{.underline}**, stressing, for instance, the
special, rather than general nationalistic, character of Zionism. Such
accounts often invoke Israeli polls demonstrating the Israeli public's
support for Israel's wars, as if Israeli jingoism is exceptional and as
if common Israelis decide, rather than merely justify, state policy.
\[21\] Relatedly, many Left accounts **[rely on liberal pluralist
arguments in order to focus,]{.underline}** like Mearsheimer and Walt,
**[on the Israel lobby]{.underline}**. For instance, prolific Marxist
writer Paul Street, who has elsewhere subjected the United States to
withering anticapitalist critique, has complained that the bulk of the
U.S. establishment is held "captive to the savage racist and sociopathic
occupation and mass-murder state Israel has become." \[22\] Thus,
**[when Left critics of Israel do address economics, they typically do
so by isolating the role of the Israel lobby rather than by examining
Israel's place in the international economy]{.underline}**. Such
accounts emphasize that the Israel lobby functions through amassing
enormously concentrated wealth that it channels into an increasingly
unregulated electoral system. However, it is merely presupposed that the
huge investors constituting the Israel lobby are primarily motivated by
national or religious affinity for Israel (if not so-called dual
loyalties), rather than the self-interest that enabled these individuals
to amass such wealth in the first place. As Michael Massing notes, the
key individuals driving the Israel lobby represent a remarkably wealthy
and minuscule fraction of U.S. Jews, who are not only far richer but
also far more hawkish on Israel than the U.S. Jewish population in
general. \[23\] **[A key factor influencing support for Israel, then, is
not merely whether you are Jewish]{.underline}** (Christian Zionists
also support Israel, with a significantly different religious-political
agenda) **[but whether you are wealthy.]{.underline}** **[Any analysis
of U.S. support for Israel, including the machinations of the Israel
lobby, therefore]{.underline}** **[needs to also situate Israel within a
global political-economic process based on the needs and demands of
investors.]{.underline}** The most prominent example of contemporary
Left criticism of Israel is of course BDS itself. BDS, which reflects
the work of sincere, devoted, and at times courageous activists, should
be credited for raising awareness of Israel's abuse of Palestinians. But
**[BDS, which looks to an imperialist system to resolve problems that
imperialism has produced, is neither radical nor
liberatory.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[BDS supporters demonstrate a
fundamental weakness in their position when they are unable to
adequately answer why, given that Israeli violence is contingent upon
U.S. support, BDS doesn't oppose the United States
itself?]{.underline}** \[24\] The answer, reflecting political impotence
that should be interrogated rather than accommodated, is that those who
support peace and justice do not have the power to make the United
States do what they want. **[Instead of addressing the implications of
this reality, however, BDS advocates either blame their powerlessness on
the Israel lobby or sidestep the question of their powerlessness
altogether, ultimately proceeding by ignoring the United States and
targeting its Israeli client.]{.underline}** \[25\] But if activists are
powerless against the U.S. patron, what makes them believe that it is
worthwhile to exert power against the Israeli client? Clients, the
history of the modern Middle East demonstrates, can be replaced.
Moreover, **[targeting Israel (the client) instead of the United States
(the patron) mystifies the source, and purpose, of the power that
activists ostensibly seek to challenge; the problems in the Middle East
did not begin with the creation of Israel and would hardly cease with
its disappearance.]{.underline}** And considering that U.S.-based BDS
activists are so powerless against their own state---the oldest living
democracy, after all---why should Palestinians be encouraged to create
one of their own? It is significant that many U.S. leftists, who rightly
condemn their own society's violence and poverty, and who have recently
witnessed their government's brutal protection of the status quo during
the coordinated police actions that crushed the Occupy Wall Street
movement, deem good enough for Palestinians what they themselves are
compelled to protest. **[It is similarly significant that BDS attempts
to wield sanctions, a form of "soft power" that states use to bend other
states to their will, against Israel. For sanctions to become something
other than a mere moral position, they require states to enforce
them.]{.underline}** But under what circumstances would, say, the United
States or United Kingdom apply sanctions against Israel? Do BDS
supporters really believe that the Obama administration shares their
moral concerns about Palestinian suffering? What does it imply that
sanctions, taken to their logical conclusion, promote a role reversal in
which the Palestinian Authority (PA) would become a U.S. proxy and
Israel would become a sanctioned "rogue state"? **[And as long as
sanctions are "an essential part of demonstrating disapproval," \[26\]
why not express this disapproval in a manner that does not invoke and
thereby reinforce the international system of which the Israel-Palestine
catastrophe is but a part?]{.underline}**

### BDS Link

#### BDS is counterproductive and trades off with the building of class solidarity -- alienates Israeli workers. The history of Apartheid in South Africa proves that BDS lacks the force and effectiveness to liberate Palestine

**Al-Jaza\'iri and Grant 2010 (**Isa and Alex, writes at in defense of
Marxism, "Against the blanket boycott of Israel - for a working class
solution",
<https://www.marxist.com/against-blanket-boycott-israel-working-class-solution.htm>**)**

Many young activists are supporting this campaign because of an honest
feeling that something must be done. **[In discussions with BDS
activists, when the point has been raised that this campaign does
nothing to weaken Israeli imperialism and in fact pushes Israeli workers
and youth into the arms of imperialists, the response has been \"well,
at least the campaign has raised awareness\".]{.underline}** We are
prepared to concede this point; the campaign has received much media
attention. However, **[not a single Palestinian family has ever been
saved from having their house knocked down thanks to a letter to the
Toronto Star or the Montreal Gazette.]{.underline}** People were also
aware of the Iraq war. 50 million people demonstrated worldwide in March
2003. But this awareness did not stop US imperialism. Neither will it
stop Israeli imperialism. **[What we need is an approach that can defeat
imperialism.]{.underline}** The real question is: \"is this the method
that can overthrow Israeli imperialism?\" The answer from the BDS
activists always returns to the experience of South Africa. How was
South African Apartheid Really Overthrown? In the Western media and
academia**[, there is a myth that the sanctions against South Africa
were the weapon that brought down the apartheid regime]{.underline}**.
Nothing could be further from the truth**[. Sanctions played a
relatively little role in undermining the white regime, which merely
passed on the privations to the black working class.]{.underline}** It
was not pressure from above, but fear of revolution from below, that led
the South African ruling class to adopt "democracy". **[Faced with
horrendous exploitation and oppression the black workers developed
powerful mass organizations. The Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU), and the South African Communist Party, in alliance with the
African National Congress, all stood for the eradication of capitalism
and the institution of a socialist society. Together these mass
organizations encompassed millions of workers.]{.underline}** COSATU
launched onto the road of strikes and class struggle and played a
decisive role in uniting the working class. The strategists of capital
came to the conclusion that if there was not reform from above, there
would be revolution from below. They did a deal with Mandela and the ANC
leadership to end "white rule" in government as long as the capitalists
continued to rule the economy. **[South African apartheid was overthrown
by the mass struggle of the black working class, who produced all of the
products of South African society, and therefore held enormous power in
their hands once united. It was this threat of socialist revolution from
below that forced the granting of concessions from above, but it should
not be forgotten either that it was a bittersweet
victory.]{.underline}** The masses could have easily overthrown
capitalism and taken power; instead they continue to live the same
misery as before, but with a black president. In the new South Africa,
the gap between the black working class and the bourgeoisie has become
even wider than it ever was under apartheid. The only difference now is
that the ANC leaders who betrayed the workers' real aspirations of a
decisive change and carried out this abortion have been rewarded
handsomely for their services. They have all raised themselves above the
masses. A layer of black bourgeoisie has arisen, and black bosses sit on
the boards of directors of major corporations. For them, life is
spectacular. **[For the black masses, nothing has changed. Apartheid
enforced by law and repression has been replaced by economic apartheid
and we are seeing a new wave of class struggle in South Africa today.
This underlines the need for a working class solution. Without it, and
within the confines of capitalism, there is no way
forward.]{.underline}** How BDS strengthens Zionism **[Israeli
capitalism, no less than South African capitalism, rests on the
exploitation of a working class majority by a bourgeois minority. Only
in this case, the working class is made up of Jewish-Israelis,
Palestinians with Israeli citizenship (20% of Israeli citizens), and
Palestinians living in the occupied territories.]{.underline}** BDS
essentially takes the approach that Israel is one monolithic reactionary
bloc, Jewish workers and bosses all happily united in the oppression of
the Palestinian people. This, however, is an over-simplification of the
real position. It is true that the Israeli ruling class for historical
reasons has succeeded in rallying the majority of the Jewish workers in
Israel behind the banner of the defence of the Israeli state against the
"Arab threat". But **[the difference between the ruling class and the
workers is that the Israeli working class -- objectively speaking -- has
absolutely no interest in oppressing the Palestinian masses. While the
bourgeoisie makes billions of dollars off of the production of weapons
and the slaughter of innocents, the working class has to watch its sons
and daughters sent off to die in wars for profit. While the profits
soar, homelessness, unemployment, and tuition fees continue their
ascent.]{.underline}** While the millionaires in Tel Aviv build more
towering office buildings to turn it into a \"financial centre\",
working class Jews are increasingly finding themselves expelled from
that city by political and deliberate rent increases. Just as in the
West, war expenditure is used in Israel as an excuse to cut back on
social security and decent conditions for public sector workers. Like in
any other country in the world, there are contradictions developing
within Israeli society that are deepening the class divide and under
certain conditions may express themselves through a rise in the class
struggle. The bourgeoisie is attempting to play a demographics game to
force working class Israeli Jews out of the cities and into the
countryside, where there is a danger that Arab-Israeli citizens will
become a majority. This has led to a struggle, and culminated in a
massive increase in support in the Tel Aviv municipal elections
(November 2008) for the Israeli Communist Party---a party started by
Palestinian-Israelis. The bosses, as always, attempted to play up
national hatreds, playing up the fact that the ICP stands for the right
of return for Palestinian refugees. It did not work. The ICP received
the same amount of council seats as the ruling party and received 35% of
the vote for mayor, a historic breakthrough. (see:
[http://www.marxist.com/israel-tel-aviv-municipal-elections-2008.htm](https://www.marxist.com/israel-tel-aviv-municipal-elections-2008.htm))
These event in the largest city in Israel cannot be dismissed as
irrelevant and shows the potential for policies not based on religious
or ethnic hatred but the common interests of the Jewish-Israeli and
Palestinian-Israeli workers. **[There have also been a series of recent
general strikes, during which the unity of Arab-Israeli and
Jewish-Israeli workers has been on marvelous display. In these strikes,
Palestinian-Israelis have often been in the forefront, leading the way
with radical tactics such as public sector workers directly collecting
taxes in order to receive their backlog of unpaid wages. These
developments are incredibly dangerous to the capitalist class. This is
the real reason behind the wars in Lebanon and Gaza: distraction and
division. The bourgeoisie, faced with the danger of a united
proletariat, conjures up fears and hatreds to sow division and distract
the working classes from their common interests and common enemy: the
Israeli capitalists.]{.underline}** Zionism is the ideology used by the
Israeli capitalists to draw the workers behind their bosses, and cut
across the class divide through \"national unity\" against the external
threat. They perpetually underline the fear of the Israeli masses of
being an isolated people, surrounded by enemies on all sides. They
opportunistically play on the historical memory of the holocaust to
convince the Jewish-Israeli working class that they are universally
hated and their only allies are the Israeli bourgeois. **[BDS attempts
to achieve its demands by actively seeking to make that isolation a
reality. It is therefore -- against the wishes of those who support it
as a useful tool to weaken Zionism -- useful for solidifying
Zionism.]{.underline}**

### Israel Link -- Generic

#### The history of the Israel-Palestine conflict cannot be understood outside the context of global capitalism -- a historical Marxist analysis is critical to re-conceptualize the political approach towards Palestinian liberation. The framing of nation and religion as the core of the struggle neglects the necessity of class to the formation of the violent social relations that situate the conflict.

**Nir and Wainwright 2018 (**Oded, assistant professor at Vassar
college, Joel, professor at Ohio State, "Where Is the Marxist Critique
of Israel/Palestine", Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

And at the heart of these conflicts lies the Israeli occupation of
Palestine. The Palestinians continue to be ground down by the Israeli
state, which (notwithstanding Netanyahu's present political troubles) is
firmly held by the Right; there is no significant political Left
(Marxist or not) to speak of on either side. The only meaning of the
so-called "peace process" is to provide the Israeli state with cover as
it continues to extend its domination over the Palestinians. Walls and
settlements continue to spread across the West Bank; Gaza is an open
prison. The seventieth anniversary of the Nakba has been marked by new
mass evictions in the West Bank (Gordon 2018) while IDF soldiers shoot
hundreds of protesters in Gaza (Cockburn 2018) and the United States has
moved its embassy to Jerusalem (Holmes 2018). Across the region, elites
exploit the Palestinian cause for opportunistic legitimation, but this
results in nothing concrete for the Palestinian people. **[One of the
many tragic results of the present crisis is that the situation in
Palestine props up a variety of authoritarian neoliberal
states.]{.underline}** In the face of the present crisis, one might
expect a plethora of Marxist analyses of Israel and Palestine. But, in
fact, there are few. It is a striking lacuna.2 In fairness, there are
stacks of books by left-wing critics of Israel (e.g., Abunimah 2014) and
some brilliant critical analysis of Zionism (e.g., Rose 2005; Butler
2012). One explanation for this lacunae---offered by Chomsky; see the
interview in this issue---is **[that there are practically no Marxists
active in U.S. universities anymore.]{.underline}** Professor Chomsky
has a point, but **[this gap goes beyond the United States, and there
are still Marxists criticizing Israel and/or Zionism both in the United
States and elsewhere. Yet when they have done so, it is almost
exclusively by criticizing the violent colonization of Palestine and
emphasizing the ethical rather than the systemic nature of this
process.]{.underline}** To make a generalization, in the literature on
Israel and Palestine in English, there are hardly any studies of class,
relations of production, or the relationship between the political and
economic balance of forces over time, and so on. Naturally, there are
exceptions, but they illuminate the norm. The failure in this respect of
the journal Rethinking Marxism is symptomatic. From a search of the
journal's digital archive of three decades, RM has published practically
nothing on Palestine and Israel.3 Our basic contention is that **[a
renewed Marxist position is necessary because the political situation is
dire and the existing framework for explaining it is ineffectual.
Marxism is essential because it is the only mode of social and political
analysis capable of grasping capital, nation, and state
synthetically.]{.underline}**4 One of our aims is to theorize this lack:
that is, to explain why there is no Marxist analysis. The result of the
political bankruptcy of the liberal Israeli position is the nightmare of
today: perpetual conflict, suffering Palestinians, futureless Israelis.
The articulation of a robust leftist position is essential. To
generalize in didactic and simplistic terms**[, the Left has framed the
conflict in terms of nation and religion]{.underline}**---Israeli/Jew
versus Palestinian/Muslim---**[leaving class and capital aside. The
political situation is thus domesticated into familiar categories that
leave only one imaginable solution: two separate states]{.underline}**.
Even if this position was once valid, the territorial basis for a
Palestinian state has been systematically destroyed by the Israeli state
through the construction of walls, barriers, highways, checkpoints, and
other apparatuses of colonization (Weizman 2007; cf., Tartir 2015).
Facing these conditions, to chant demands for a Palestinian state
reflects either bad faith or a hypocritical false optimism.
**[Recognizing the absence of a two-state solution]{.underline}**, we
contend, **[should compel us to rethink Israel/Palestine though
categories that cut across national lines. This is where a Marxist
analysis of history, class, and capitalist political economy is crucial.
The aim is to grasp Israel/Palestine as a part of a contradictory unity,
a differentiated totality, within a world wracked by severe
political-economic crises. This implies presenting both diachronic and
synchronic alternatives that try to understand each detail within a
contradictory totality. The notion of contradictory totality is already
implied by the bifurcated object---"Israel/Palestine"---that we have
become accustomed to name the problem]{.underline}**. But does
Israel/Palestine constitute a socioeconomic whole? Certainly not.
**[Grasping this contradictory totality requires, inter alia, studying
the formation of capitalist social relations in
Palestine.]{.underline}**5 A robust literature examines the
political-economic dimensions of Israel and the occupation of
Palestine.6 These and other non-Marxist works lay the critical
foundation for a Marxist interpretation of Israel/Palestine as both a
specific, constantly changing economic-geographical region and a
capitalist society in which the "ordinary" qualities of bourgeois
society express unusual characteristics. Consider the market for labor
power. Some Palestinians remain proletarians for Israeli capitalism. But
since the early 1990s, "foreign" labor has largely substituted for
Palestinian labor, a trend strongly encouraged by the Israeli government
(Kemp and Raijman 2008). A 2011 ILO report observes that during the
1990s "a major influx of foreign workers \[entered Israel\] as
substitute for Arab workers from the Palestinian Authority. Many of
these foreign workers were illegal and did not possess proper government
permits. Many businesses employed foreign laborers in sub-par
conditions, denying them basic rights and lowering wages and benefits"
(Nathanson 2011, 32). Israeli capital is simply not dependent on
Palestinian labor power. By implication, strikes by Palestinian labor
cannot play the role that strikes played in the confrontation with South
African apartheid (Chomsky 2015, 72--6). Thus, **[observed geographical
and juridical contiguities are misleading: the causes of the
Palestinians becoming surplus population are to be sought in the
dynamics of global capitalism]{.underline}**. The same could be said for
the real-estate bubble currently propelling the Israeli urban economy
(Cohen 2017). This is not to deny that the Israeli state bears
responsibility for the Palestinians' plight; rather **[it is to recall
that we must situate the Israeli state and society within global
capitalism if we seek to understand it]{.underline}**.7 Among other
things, **[this requires rejecting one of the most problematic claims
concerning Israel/Palestine sometimes heard on the left: the
mystification of the Israeli oppression of Palestinians via the
conversion of violence into "spirit"]{.underline}** ("the occupation
corrupts"). This liberal formula should be demystified. **[The only
system that unifies both arenas---the internal social one and the
external national one---is capitalism. The liberal tendency to frame the
conflict in religious terms (Jews versus Muslims) is symptomatic of the
disavowal of confronting capital.]{.underline}**

### Israel Link -- Settler Colonialism

#### Their recognition of Israel as a Settler-Colonial state is not a new insight but a limited theoretical turn that denies the evolution of neoliberalism in the globalization of imperial violence. The policing and expansion in the west bank and gaza characteristic of their impact claims is not a racial strategy of dispossession but a neoliberal spatial fix to respond to the contractions of capitalism's contradictions. 

**Nir and Wainwright 2018 (**Oded, assistant professor at Vassar
college, Joel, professor at Ohio State, "Where Is the Marxist Critique
of Israel/Palestine", Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

To be sure, **[Israel is a settler-colonial state, yet recognizing this
is insufficient for grasping the valences of the present
conflict]{.underline}**. This important point was established clearly in
the 1960s by an anti-Stalinist Marxist organization in Israel (and
journal by the same name), Matzpen. The four basic elements of Matzpen's
analysis in the 1960s are elegantly summarized by one of its leading
theorists, Moshé Machover (2012, x--xi), in the preface to his collected
writings. The first point is, "**[1. Zionism is a colonizing project,
and Israel, its embodiment, is a settler state]{.underline}**." The
other three claims differ from many mainstream leftist analyses and bear
consideration today: **[2. Zionist colonization]{.underline}** belongs
to a different species from, for example, that of South Africa ...
**[rather than being based on exploiting the labor power of the
indigenous people, it sought to exclude and eliminate them;
3.]{.underline}** We insisted on the regional context of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict ... the **[balance of power is heavily
tilted in favor of Israel (backed by its imperialist sponsor \[the
USA\]) ... This imbalance could only be redressed ... as part of a
revolutionary transformation of the region ...]{.underline}** ;
**[4.]{.underline}** Our regional view ... applied not only to the
process whereby it would be resolved but also extended to the form of
the resolution itself. Unlike almost all who addressed the issue,14 we
did not believe that a resolution would occur within the confines of
Palestine ... Thus, we did not advocate a so-called two-state solution
in a repartitioned Palestine, nor a "one-state solution" in a unitary
Palestine. Instead, **[we envisaged incorporation of the two national
groups ... as units with equal rights within a socialist regional union
or federation of the Arab East.]{.underline}** Matzpen's analysis
remained relatively marginal within Israel-Palestine and in
international Marxism. We should recover these insights and bring them
up to date in light of the changes in capitalism (accounting, e.g., for
the neoliberal turn and present global crisis) as well as international
political dynamics (the maturation and declining hegemony of U.S.
imperialism). **[From the Matzpen perspective, then, the central point
of post-Zionism---Israel is a settler-colonial state---is old news,
delivered without sufficient depth of analysis. Yet it should be clear
that for all of Matzpen's appeal to a utopian socialist future, its
analysis remains a non-Marxist one; it stops short of relating the
analysis of political relations to the contradictions of
capitalism.]{.underline}** Instructive in this vein is the introduction
to the 1999 edition of Peace, Peace, When There Is No Peace, originally
published in 1961 (Machover and Orr 1999). In the new
introduction---absent from the book's English translation---the authors
report that, in the time that elapsed between 1961 and 1999, they have
changed their minds about how they view Zionism: while before they saw
Zionism as a movement pitted against British imperialism, now they see
Zionism as simply part of the colonial project. The missing term here is
the post-Zionist revision of the history of Zionism, a line that Matzpen
joined somewhat belatedly with this new introduction.15 **[The
insufficiency of the settler-colonial framework is also clear in the
case of Ilan Pappé]{.underline}**. Pappé (2017, 13) writes that "the
tale of Palestine from the beginning until today is a simple story of
colonialism and dispossession, yet the world treats it as a multifaceted
and complex story---hard to understand and even harder to solve." Since,
from the vantage of its victims, colonialism is a tale of loss,
violence, and violation, he is certainly right. Yet from the vantage of
all those who would struggle for justice, collectivity, and another
future, Pappé's claim is facile. There has never been, from this
vantage, "a simple story of colonialism and dispossession." Like
Tolstoy's unhappy families, **[the conditions of each colonial society
are particular; the specific complexities that comprise them matter for
those who wish to produce alternative worlds.]{.underline}** One recent
non-Marxist statement of this principal is provided by Rachel Busbridge
(2018, 110). **[Busbridge contends that defining Israel as a
settler-colonial state "promises to rejuvenate the Palestinian struggle
under the prescriptive banner of decolonization," yet "this is where the
most strident limitations of the settler-colonial paradigm come into
view, due to, at best, underdeveloped reflection on the possibilities
and practicalities of decolonization and, at worst, connotations
deriving from its contextual point of origin flattening out important
local historical and socio-political specificities."]{.underline}**
Attentiveness to particularity requires historicizing Zionism anew.
Zionism emerged in the nineteenth century as a utopian politics aiming
for the liberation of a subaltern transnational proletariat through the
formation of a new society. To appreciate the tragedy and prospects for
change in Israel and Palestine, **[it will be insightful to consider
Zionism as a failed project of collective liberation. The realization of
this political movement through the colonization of Palestine and the
reorganization of Zionist society as a capitalist nation-state signaled
the end of the utopian element.]{.underline}** Any sophisticated Marxist
insists that **[history's march requires constant renarration. Only
through the efforts of renarration are we able to represent the present
as a space of collective historical practice, as a space in which the
tensions of everchanging subjective experience point toward objective
systemic contradictions as a space of struggle over the
future]{.underline}**. For instance, the debates within the Marxist Left
over the legacies of the 1968 revolts attest precisely to the continuous
need to renarrate history as borne by history's movement itself**[. Yet
when the political Left---including many Marxists---address Israel and
Zionism, the commitment to renarrating history weakens.]{.underline}**
The same narratives are repeated with little variation: Zionism is seen
as a colonial movement that has expropriated Palestinian land, and the
state of Israel is seen as a direct continuation of this history,
oppressing, dispossessing, and exploiting the Palestinians. To explore
new historical narratives of Israel and Zionism does not mean a
repudiation of these narratives. The veracity of their factual basis is
not questioned here. Nor is there an implied abandonment of the ethical
stance immanent to this historical account, that of an uncompromising
demand for justice for the Palestinians**[.]{.underline}** Rather than
opposing these historical accounts, a commitment to narrating this
history anew can translate it into a political project that resonates
more strongly with popular concerns and contemporary realities. **[Yet
for those who are committed to a Marxist perspective, our call to
historicize post-Zionism and renarrate the history of Zionism may cause
disorientation: a troubling of one's political allegiances, a threat of
losing one's political bearings. For post-Zionism was at its most
influential precisely at the same time that the neoliberal
transformation of the Israeli economy was beginning to take
place]{.underline}**. That both of these elements---**[neoliberalization
and post-Zionism---share a deep antagonism to the nation-state and
its]{.underline}** institutions could be taken as a sign of the link
between the two. **[The material or institutional connection between the
attack on the state and the Israeli occupation has never been very
difficult to find]{.underline}**, even though few scholars have examined
it in any detail. **[The wholesale liquidation of Israeli social
protections and centralized economic planning drove poor Israelis to
live in West Bank settlements]{.underline}**, as Daniel Gutwein notes.16
One implication is that **[coastal Israeli land, on which
state-subsidized agriculture was thriving, became a goldmine for private
capital rent extraction]{.underline}** in the 1980s. But **[the
implications are most significant with respect to the settlements
spilling across the West Bank.]{.underline}** Here is Gutwein's (2006)
argument: **[The settlements project in the Territories and the rapid
growth of economic inequality in Israel have been complimentary
foundations of the social and political power relations that the Right
has constructed since 1977 to secure its hegemony. Regarding the
universal welfare state as one of the main sources of power of the Left,
the Right has used Thatcher-like practices to liquidate the welfare
state through privatization and commercialization of its
services.]{.underline}** Naturally, this policy initially affected
mainly the lower classes. Accordingly, **[in order to offset the losses
it inflicted on its voters, the Right has constituted a compensatory
mechanism by splitting Israeli society into rival interest groups ...
\[and has\] worked to undermine the universal welfare state and replace
it as suppliers of partial substitutes to its gradually liquidated
services]{.underline}** ... \[As\] the universal welfare state was
liquidated in \[the area of\] pre1967 Israel, an alternative sectorial
welfare state was constructed in the Territories. **[The enormous
benefits which the "Land of Settlements" offers in housing, education,
health, taxation, infrastructure and employment, have actually become a
mechanism which compensated the lower classes for the damages inflicted
upon them by the privatization of welfare services in
Israel.]{.underline}** From this perspective **[the illegal program of
constantly expanding settlements becomes an attempt to geographically
solve the social contradictions generated by neoliberalism---a spatial
fix where political economy reinforces ideology. A Marxist view could
therefore see post-Zionism as unintentionally useful for the champions
of neoliberalism and the dissolution of working-class economic
protections while inadvertently supporting the settlement enterprise and
thus sabotaging the achievement of the peace in whose name it was
acting]{.underline}**, as we argue below.

### Israel Link -- Settler colonialism

#### Set col theory fails without a central understanding of the proletariat -- 1. Ignoring labour in the formation of the Israel/Palestine conflict mystifies the production of occupation and genocide 2. Analyzing settler colonialism through a frame of labour provide a critical orientation towards liberation that their theory denies.

**Locker-Biletzki 2018 (**Amir, post-doc @ Concordia University,
"Rethinking Settler Colonialism: A Marxist Critique of Gershon Shafir",
Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

In recent years, settler colonialism has become a hotly debated concept.
Within the controversies of its interpretation of the
Zionist-Palestinian conflict, settler colonialism has developed into a
focal point for critical thought. The purpose of this essay is to
creatively reinterpret and critique the application of the
settler-colonialism concept while preserving some of its explanatory
force. It argues that **[while Marxian elements are present in the
theories of students of settler colonialism, this research field as a
whole has shied away from more overtly Marxist interpretations of the
settler-colonial phenomenon]{.underline}**. This can be seen in the case
of settler colonialism in Palestine/Israel. I argue **[that the model of
settler-colonial societies, particularly in the context of
Palestine/Israel, disregards one essential element for the
interpretation of the conflict: the role of capitalist class development
within colonial political economy]{.underline}**. This essay maintains
that the categories originating from the Marxist tradition have played
an important part in creating the settler-colonial dynamics that have
enabled both the depopulation Palestine's natives and the rise of the
Jewish state. The main theoretical framework criticized in this essay is
that advanced by Gershon Shafir in his seminal 1989 book Land, Labor and
the Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, 1882--1914. The essay
will be based on Marxist concepts--- mainly class within a capitalist
mode of production. These concepts will be used in conjunction with the
literature that interprets the economic and social development of
Palestine/Israel in order to show that **[within the logic of separatism
---which has characterized Zionist settler colonialism---capitalism was
constructed by both Palestinians and Jews. This capitalist development
of the separate parts of Palestine's economy was characterized by the
formation of both propertied and laboring classes.]{.underline}** It is
my aim not to debunk settler colonialism as a way to frame the history
of Palestine/Israel. I wish instead to reintroduce into the
settler-colonial discourse Marxism as a historical point of reference
and as an emancipatory force. This dual purpose is encapsulated well in
the words of Rachel Busbridge (2017, 10), who writes that while Jamal
Hilal's Marxist account of the conflict, for instance, engaged
Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in terms of their relations to the
means of production, Wolfe's account brings its own ontology: **[the
bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction becomes that of settler/native and
the class struggle the struggle \[sic\] between settler, who seeks to
destroy and replace the native, and native, who can only ever push back.
Indeed, if the settler colonial paradigm views history in similar
teleological terms to the Marxist framework, it does not offer the same
hopeful vision of a liberated future.]{.underline}** The purpose of this
essay is to reclaim these Marxist categories into the settler-colonial
model by reintroducing the potential for liberation that Marxism offers
through class struggle. In order to accomplish this twofold objective,
the essay will briefly trace the Marxist origins of the settler-colonial
model---mainly in the works of Maxime Rodinson and Jamil Hilal---as well
as the Marxian elements of present-day scholars of settler colonialism.
Marx and Engels were the first to historicize class as part of the
historical development of society. This element is seen most clearly in
the opening of the Communist Manifesto: "The history of all hitherto
existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave,
patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a
word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one
another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight" (Marx
and Engels 2004, 3). In Palestine/Israel the rise of a capitalist
society out of the ruins of the late Ottoman feudal system was
accompanied by the formation of a type of class society and antagonism
(Ben-Porat 1999). By 1948, both Palestinian and Jewish societies
possessed working and bourgeoisie classes. **[While these classes
developed differently, they engaged in struggles that at times had a
binational anticolonial (i.e., anti-British) nature]{.underline}**
(Seikaly 2016; Lockman 1995). **[These histories of joint class action,
seen from a Marxist point of view, carry with them the possibility of
emancipation for both nationalities. At the same
time]{.underline}**---as this essay's survey of class history in
Palestine/Israel will show---**[class development was deeply bifurcated
along ethnonational lines. Separation benefited the Jewish working
class, which preferred to push Palestinians outside the labor market
over engaging in class solidarity]{.underline}** (Shapira 1977).

### Israel Link -- Settler Colonialism

#### The settler colonial frames neglects and denies the historical necessity of class to the formation of the Israel/Palestine conflict and possibilities of resistance. Palestinian and Israeli bourgeois cooperated to structurally exclude proletarian workers from labour markets. The frame of their analysis makes proletarian cooperation across class lines impossible -- communist political alternatives are necessary to harness international solidarity across their rigid and ahistorical binaries of identification.

**Locker-Biletzki 2018 (**Amir, post-doc @ Concordia University,
"Rethinking Settler Colonialism: A Marxist Critique of Gershon Shafir",
Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

The development of the Palestinian and Jewish bourgeoisie took place
along the settler-colonial divide that Shafir described. In cases,
**[Jewish and Palestinian capitalists]{.underline}** cooperated, most
notably in the citrus industry (Kabha and Karlinsky 2017) and in Haifa
(Bernstein 2000). However, **[in general these two classes developed in
parallel]{.underline}**. Their loyalty to their respective national
movements superseded any joint class interests they might have shared.
But the fact that class formation did take place lends nuance to the
picture that Shafir has painted. Instead of two monolithic
societies---settlers and the colonized---competing for labor and land, a
more complicated picture emerges. In this historical reality**[, class
and class interests (economic and cultural) played a part in shaping the
Palestinian and Jewish societies.]{.underline}** As Sherene Seikaly
(2016) shows, the emerging Palestinian capitalist class reflected its
economic interests in a discourse of social hierarchy. This discourse
created subjects such as the bourgeois man and woman, the Falaḥim, the
Bedouin, and the worker---all within what Seikaly clearly defines as a
settler-colonial reality. **[The Jewish working class in
Palestine/Israel was formed in two main stages, both of which involved
turning Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe or the Arab world with
bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie backgrounds into
workers]{.underline}**. The first process of proletarianization took
place from 1903 to 1948 and involved turning Eastern European Jews into
wage workers. The second process, from the early 1950s, was the
conversion of Jews from the Arab East into workers (De Vries 1994;
Ben-Porat 1986, 1991, 1992; Bernstein 2000; Lockman 1995). From the
early stages of the process that turned young Eastern European Jewish
settlers from lower-middle-class backgrounds into workers, these workers
showed two main characteristics. The first was a propensity to organize,
brought with them from industrializing Eastern Europe. As a class, the
Jewish workers---despite the ambivalent stance of the Histadrut---tended
to strike in defense of their rights (De Vries 2015). While in most
cases class militancy was not translated into interclass solidarity with
Palestinian workers, the picture that Shafir paints does not capture all
the nuances of labor and capital relations in Palestine/Israel.
Certainly, the Zionist logic of colonial separation raised Jewish
workers to the highest-paid positions in the labor market. In addition,
**[the Zionist colonial separation of the Jewish economy protected
Jewish workers from the inexhaustible pool of cheap Palestinian
labor]{.underline}**; adopting the Zionist ideology of Avoda Ivrit
**[served the class interests of Jewish workers---protecting their
relatively privileged place within the labor market and at times their
very survival]{.underline}**. Consider the campaign for using only
Jewish labor in the moshavot citrus groves. While the work in the
orchards did not attract Jewish workers in times of full employment, at
times of economic crisis, working in the moshavot became one of the few
options available to them. Consequently, the ideology of "Hebrew work"
became a manifestation of their class interest (Shapira 1977). While the
bulk of the evidence supports **[Shafir's conclusions]{.underline}**,
**[he does not take account of the continued history of interclass
cooperation]{.underline}**. Before 1948, Palestine's economy was divided
between predominantly Jewish and Arab sectors and a government-
controlled sector. **[In contrast to Jewish-owned enterprises, the
British colonial state did not prefer expensive Jewish labor. This gave
rise to incidents that enabled Jewish and Palestinian workers to engage
in joint union work]{.underline}**. In two notable cases, Jewish and
Arab workers organized together. **[In 1931, the Palestinian and Jewish
bus drivers, motivated by the taxation policies of the government, went
on strike together. Their action did not just "lead to a typical
anti-colonial struggle against the British government, but it also
undermined Jewish workers' and merchants' acquiescence in the Zionist
strategy of nation-building imposed by Jewish labor
organizations]{.underline}**" (Grinberg 2003, 372). Lev **[Grinberg's
analysis of the strike "criticizes the 'settler-society'
approach]{.underline}** developed by Baruch Kimmerling and Gershon
Shafir, which focused only on the policies and strategies of organized
Jewish labor, shaped by the structural conditions of colonization."
Grinberg's **[approach suggests "a 'historical-constructionist'
perspective that analyzes the mutual relations between Jews and Arabs of
different social classes." Another historical moment when Palestinian
and Jewish workers bridged the settler-colonial divide was related to
the government-owned railroads. Jews and Arabs]{.underline}**---the
largest and most advanced workforce in 1920s Palestine---**[worked
together in the 1920s in an international Arab-Jewish
union.]{.underline}** Even after the emergence of separate Arab and
Jewish unions, workers of both peoples organized together (Lockman
1995). Despite these historical moments of Arab-Jewish interclass
supranational solidarity, they were not prevalent among the continued
loyalty to one's national movement and the pressure from the Zionist
labor movement that objected to joint organization, in keeping with the
colonial logic of separation. There was a lack of an appealing ideology
that would unite Palestinian and Jewish workers beyond their national
identities---**[the Communist Party that preached such ideas was too
small and marginal to be effective. This contributed to the small number
of cases in which Palestinian and Jewish workers organized
together.]{.underline}**

### Ferguson and Palestine Link/alternative 

#### Revolutionary violence is key -- calls to pacifism in response to the violence of Ferguson is an anti-revolutionary tactic of elites to quell resistance. Their lukewarm political activism dooms marginalized people to a passive accepting of violence -- our slogan shouldn't be "Hands up, don't shoot" it should be "arms up, shoot back".

Russell, Larry Jackson Jr., Jonathan Ferrell, Jordan Baker, and Michael
Brown. **[These are just some of the names of, mostly young, black men
(and boys) killed by law enforcement since the dawn of the new
millennium. They were all unarmed. The above list does not include the
names of black men assaulted and maimed by police, and is simply just
scratching the surface of the human toll that state violence has
wrought]{.underline}**. Additionally, it does not include individuals
killed by security guards or vigilantes (a prime example being George
Zimmerman's murder of Trayvon Martin). While black men seemingly prove
to experience increased instances of police violence, there are no
statistics to verify this, police agencies (local, state, and federal)
do not generally keep tabs on whom their officers kill, and when they do
the numbers are neither thorough nor are they complete. When a cop kills
a civilian, even if the civilian did not have a weapon, the trend seems
to be that the officer is cleared of any wrong doing, or at the very
most is given a paltry sentence, often reduced once the mind of the
public is turned elsewhere**[. Police killings of unarmed men are not
unique to the black demographic. Indeed, extrajudicial murders---what
most police killings tend to be---occur across gender and racial lines,
though of course Afro-Americans, Latinos, the mentally ill, migrant
laborers, and anyone who does not immediately submit to police power and
authority seemingly bear the brunt of the violence meted out by
police]{.underline}**. One needs only conduct a brief Internet search to
see videos of police in the United States wantonly killing people whilst
in the line of duty. The 24 November grand jury decision not to indict
Darren Wilson over the 9 August fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown
has been met with a mixed consensus amongst people in the United States.
On the one hand, there are those who claim that the rule of law has
prevailed, and that there is nothing else to do. For others**[, there is
a feeling of indignance that has catapulted people into large, sometimes
violent, demonstrations in Ferguson and across the United States. State
officials and political pundits have either vilified the protests or
appealed for some semblance of calm in the wake of the grand jury's
decision]{.underline}**. There is almost no discussion on the
anti-democratic nature of the grand jury process, on Jay Nixon
preemptively calling a state of emergency, or the role that the police
play in this society. **[The focus, it seems, is on the lack of
so-called civility on behalf of some of the protesters. Conservatives
often use racialist, if not overtly racist, rhetoric when considering
what is happening in Ferguson. Liberals appeal to the protestors to
harken to the whitewashed legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and engage in
peaceful demonstrations. The time for peace has passed, indeed it never
existed in this country.]{.underline}** It doesn't matter if Brown
robbed a convenience store, or even if he assaulted Wilson. What matters
is that the case highlights the depths to which the capitalist state and
its police forces will protect their own and attempt to stifle any sort
of dissent. Imagine if Wilson was the aggressor in the situation---which
is more likely than Brown being the aggressor---and Brown defended
himself with deadly force, mortally wounding Wilson. Brown would have
likely go to prison for life, whereas Wilson has been cleared for what
has been deemed a justifiable shooting. And it is justifiable based on
how police operate within the United States: with near impunity. The
violence of the police is almost always defensible in the eyes of the
ruling elite, as evinced by Barack Obama's platitudes to liberal desires
to the rule of law in the aftermath of the grand jury decision. So, why
then is the violence of the protestor so reviled? It is confounding that
the people seem more concerned about the loss of property than the loss
of life in the aftermath of the Ferguson decision. **[While there are
opportunists who have used the protests to their own end, the acts of
looting, destruction of property, and violence directed towards state
representatives is not only warranted, it is necessary. If people could,
they would target the police, but the protesters know that a direct
confrontation (with what is now a military force in this country) at
this time would likely result in their deaths. The destruction of
property in the area is the next best option. And while it is lamentable
that some so-called mom-and-pop shops are targeted alongside the larger
businesses, it is the truly dispossessed, downtrodden, social
ostracized, and oppressed peoples who are engaging in the only viable
option to lash out at an increasingly militarized, bureaucratically
regimented, and authoritarian society.]{.underline}** It is clear that
while the murder of Michael Brown was the catalyst for these events, it
4---GC Advocate---Fall no. 3 2014 is not the cause. The cause is the
decades long, the centuries long, daily oppression people experience at
the hands of the capitalist state. Historically, the police, and
specifically the policing of minority communities in the United States
can be traced to the epoch of chattel slavery. The modern police were
developed from, at times directly so, the ranks of slave catchers. The
racialized policing and subjugation of Afro-Americans and, later, of
Amerindians, European immigrant communities, Latinos and others was born
from the desire to maintain a white supremacist state. It does not seem
as though much has changed in this regard since the defeat of Radical
Reconstruction in 1877. **[The problem with the protestors' violence in
Ferguson is that it is unorganized. If the violence was to be organized,
and the protestors armed---more so than the few that sparingly
are---then the brunt of social pressures would not be laid onto middling
proprietors, but unto those deserving the most virulent response of an
enraged populace. Calls for calm emanating from the upper strata of
society are an attempt to mitigate the popular indignation that has long
been bubbling under the surface of the society. The violence against
property, that is destruction and theft, is only an unorganized form of
something with the potential to be far more revolutionary and inspiring.
To say that an all-out class war is on the horizon would be hyperbolic
at this point, and maybe even myopic, but the undergirding social
structures that position disenfranchised and working class peoples well
below the dictatorship of capital are being pressured, the police being
only one such institution. With increased organization, the Ferguson
protests and riots do have the potential to transform from seemingly
random attacks to ones that aim at puncturing the status quo. This is
not a quixotic notion, it is within the realm of material possibilities,
and activist-scholars should be lending their weight to this and other
attendant struggles.]{.underline}** **[The reliability and social
productivity of voting for bourgeoisie parties is long dead. The
demonstration turned riot, turned revolt, is the most effective means to
bring about a new, more egalitarian social paradigm.]{.underline}**
While the current "unrest" in Ferguson and around the country is
unlikely lead to any revolutionary impetus, it is a start**[. As
people's consciousness is transmuted from subservience to the prevailing
ideologies of the elite to something related to their actual position in
the society, drastic social change will become increasingly
possible.]{.underline}** The death of Michael Brown has spurred this
process and has fomented mass discontent with the government.
Furthermore**[, the events in Ferguson have fomented the most visible
resistance to the status quo in the United States. What is needed now is
to take the next step from indiscriminate attacks to ones directly
pointed at state power as well as at the lackeys and apologists who
allow it to prosper. The transformative potential emanating from the
protestors' violence in Ferguson and elsewhere will not help recoup some
"golden age" in the United States---there never was one---but can
hopefully prove to be the kernel of radically altered social
relations.]{.underline}** **[During the protests in New York City in the
days after the decision to not indict Wilson, thousands took to the
streets empathetically chanting "Hands Up, Don't Shoot!" Some, however,
went even further, shouting the slogan "Arms Up, Shoot Back!" The former
statement represents an appeal to state authorities, namely the police,
to cease its murderous rampage upon those living in this
country.]{.underline}** **[The latter, represents a
challenge]{.underline}**---albeit prematurely and an incendiary one,
given the balance of forces---**[to those that currently wield power,
and have the legal (fictitious) right to kill whom they see
fit]{.underline}**. Instead of attempting to demonize the rioters and
looters by invoking the image and memory of Martin Luther King Jr.,
**[it would be more advantageous for those "progressives" in our society
to understand the Ferguson protests as part of the same genealogy as the
Deacons for Defense, Malcolm X, Robert F. Williams, and the Black
Panthers. What is occurring in Ferguson is symptomatic of the social
dislocation that has been ever present but has yet to ferment. When the
state comes down on its citizenry violently, we must resist, with
equitable violence if necessary]{.underline}**. The attacks on property
in Ferguson only need be redirected for a magnificent transformation of
consciousness to come out of Michael Brown's death. **[If not, then
Brown's death, the deaths of the aforementioned men, and the millions
who suffered and died under the jackboot of state oppression in this
country would have partially been lost in vain. Let us not protest the
protestors, but express our solidarity, and our commitment to their
struggle, which is invariably our own struggle. As we solidarize and
join with the embattled communities in and around Ferguson, let us also
remember to look beyond the provincial confines of our own state and
express solidarity with others who struggle for a more just and
equitable society, be they in Palestine, Mexico, or Burkina Faso. In the
word of the late Burkinabé revolutionary Thomas Sankara, "It took the
madmen of yesterday for us to be able to act with extreme clarity today.
I want to be one of those madmen. We must dare to invent the
future."]{.underline}**

capitalism is responsible is]{.underline}** the next one briefly
examined by Leech: that of the specter of **[catastrophic climate
change.]{.underline}** Leech claims it to be a "truly inconvenient
truth" that **[the capitalist system itself is incapable of mitigating
the total threat posed by global warming and instead precipitates this
grim eventuality due to its incessant need for ceaseless expansion and
profit, based principally on the indefinite exploitation of hydrocarbon
resources]{.underline}**. Clearly, **[it is the world's poor who so far
have suffered the most from capitalism's degradation of the climate,
despite having contributed next to nothing to the perpetuation of this
world-historical problem]{.underline}**: the estimated 2,000 Kenyan
farmers who killed themselves upon the failure of rains in 2008, as
Leech mentions, or the 260,000 Somalis murdered in the 2011 famine that
followed from the worst drought in the past 7 decades. Leech observes
that **[the ever-increasing annual death toll for which capital-induced
climate destabilization is responsible will merely cause the overall
number of 10 million annual preventable deaths to burgeon, leading
ultimately perhaps to the deaths of "millions -- or even billions," in
what may well develop into the extermination of humanity
altogether.]{.underline}**

### Gendered Violence Impact

#### Capitalism is the root of gendered structural violence and denies women of basic human rights, with poor women of color subject to life-threatening risks

**Anglin 2010** (Mary K. Anglin; Professor of Anthropology at University
of Kentucky; 5/24/10; "Feminist perspectives on structural violence";
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1070289X.1998.9962613?casa_token=eO0Z4d-O5uUAAAAA:p5ZrVh1JGDXeyligESk1VUdYn1q8SCKutAF3ZJeLZWJmgwjaxabrYTSG-\_KeS-mUL2vZw9MxP0TJ0Q;

This special issue of Identities critically examines the kinds of
violence produced by structures of domination. Most often examinations
of violence define violence more narrowly, focusing attention on overt
forms of coercion such as warfare, suppression of dissent by government
forces, or physical assault. However,**[violence also takes such forms
as the expropriation of vital economic and non-material resources and
the operation of systems of social stratification or categorization that
subvert people\'s chances for survival]{.underline}**. Race and gender
relations, for example, can be understood as the imposition of
categories of difference that legitimate hierarchy and inequality.
**[Through structural forms of violence persons are socially and
culturally marginalized in ways that deny them the opportunity for
emotional and physical well-being, or expose them to assault or rape, or
subject them to hazards that can cause sickness and
death.]{.underline}** In expanding our definition to include structural
forms of violence we can better understand that social and government
policies that valorize particular family forms and jeopardize others,
programs that resolve local and national budgetary problems by
withdrawing social support from the \"underserving\" many, and renewed
emphases on incarceration and other disciplin- ary techniques produce
violence in the guise of social stability and order. The net result of
these and other practices is to engender a kind of **[structural
violence that is normalized and accepted as part of the \"status
quo,\"but that is experienced as injustice and brutality]{.underline}**
at particular intersections of race, ethnicity, class, nation- ality,
gender, and age. In this issue **[the focus is on gendered structures of
violence, which are seen as rooted in the globalization of
capitalism]{.underline}** and \"the crisis of the contemporary state\"
in its efforts to contain subject populations and monopolize power
(Nagengast 1994: 109-110). While forms of structural violence can
certainly be connected to the emergence of state societies, with their
logics of exclusion and domination, **[the development of capitalism
brought with it categories of difference and inequality in addition to
new technologies of power. Recent restructurings of
capitalism]{.underline}**, often termed \"globalization,\" **[have meant
further intensification and rationalization of modes of domination,
subordinating peoples and lands on a trans- national scale and
realigning social relations to better meet the needs of
capital]{.underline}**. The renewed proliferation and heightening of
nationalist ideologies, which redefine gender and ethnicity in
conjunction with notions of citizenship, appear to be one dimension of
these processes. The physicality and \"everydayness\" of violence are
consequently to be viewed from the vantage point of complex political
economic processes not the \"distorting dichotomy of victim versus
perpetrator\" (Robben and Nordstrom 1995: 8,10). In other words, it is
not that **[human beings are inherently violent, but rather that certain
contexts and social formations seem to produce violence]{.underline}**.
From this perspec- tive, the imposition of racialized, gender-, and/or
class-based social hierarchies; the curtailment of life chances; and the
routiniza- tion of dominant discourses can also be recognized as forms
of violence that, if covert are no less egregious in their effects
(Beneria and Feldman 1992; Bourdieu 1977; Desjarlais and Kleinman 1997;
Etienne and Leacock 1980; Foucault 1977; Freidenberg 1995; Gramsd 1971;
Green 1998; Harrison 1995; Heggenhougen 1995; Marx 1975; Page and Thomas
1994; Gregory and Sanjek 1994; Susser 1996). Thus, while the Holocaust
remains the paramount example of genoddal praxis under the aegis of the
state, new forms of genocide are found in the coercive processes through
which nationalisms and ethnic identities have been reconstituted with
the consolidation of nation-states (Adams 1998; Denitch 1994; Nordstrom
and Martin 1992; Olujic 1998; Ramphele 1997; Yuval-Davis 1993) and
equally in the dismissal of certain kinds of persons as \"beyond
reclama- tion\" or superfluous from the standpoint of advanced
capitalist nations (Dehavenon 1995; Hopper and Baumohl 1994; Jones 1995;
Richie 1995; Torruellas 1995; Vincent 1993; Wacquant 1996; Williams
1992). In addition to the physical destruction of kindreds and
generations, **[violence takes shape in the denial of human rights and
the silencing of traumatized, dislocated peoples]{.underline}** (Daniel
and Knudsen 1995; Wilson 1997). Violence also includes the degrada- tion
of the environment, seen as a disposable commodity in the service of
capital (Alder 1992). The implications of the latter dimen- sion of
violence are made apparent in disputes over the effects of environmental
contamination on human health and the viability of communities, as well
as in specific efforts to stem the course of further devastation
(Bullard 1994; Westra and Wenz 1995). The essays in Surviving Gendered
Structures of Violenceexamine manifestations of violent state processes
with particular attention to the means through which violence is
generated, experienced, and contested within categories of gender.
Social programs, military strategies, economic priorities, bureaucratic
practices---all shape the material contexts in which people live or fail
to survive. As Susser illustrates in her article, the dismantling of the
welfare state is as much a reflection of economic restructuring wherein
cities like New York are repositioned as financial centers on a global
scale, with housing and employment opportunities geared toward the new
elite, as it is a reassertion of the view that the indigent do not merit
public support. However, by **[restricting access to critical resources,
current approaches to poverty in the US. place poor women---and women of
color especially---at increased risk of becoming homeless, experiencing
domestic violence, being separated from kin networks, contracting
life-threatening illnesses, and losing their children.]{.underline}**
The transitional housing program studied by Susser effectively erased
women\'s former connections to communities and ways of life, while doing
little to resolve the need for safety from domestic violence and
economic problems that propelled them into homelessness. Caught in this
bind, the women in Sussex\'s study engaged in survival strategies that
were both highly resourceful and at times self-defeating.

### Consumerism Impact

#### Consumerism is a key plank to capitalism and cause structural violence

**McGregor 2003** (Sue McGregor; Coordinator at Mount Saint Vincent
University; 1/03; "Consumerism as a source of structural violence";
<http://www.kon.org/hswp/archive/consumerism.pdf>; 7/28/19)

**[Under the spell of consumerism, few people give thought to whether
their consumption habits produce class inequality, alienation, or
repressive power, i.e., structural violence]{.underline}**. People are
concerned more with the \"stuff of life\" rather than with \"quality of
life,\" least of all the quality of life of those producing the goods
they consume. Indeed, **[consumerism is manifested in chronic purchasing
of new goods and services]{.underline}** with little attention to their
true need, durability, country of origin, working conditions, or
environmental consequences of manufacture and disposal ("Why overcoming
consumerism,"1997). To conclude, **[capitalistic consumerism needs an
infrastructure in order to continue to manifest itself]{.underline}**.
Components of that infrastructure include technology and
telecommunications, corporate-led globalization, the neo-liberal market
ideology, world financial institutions, and complacent, or complicit,
governments. Most significantly, the other component of this
infrastructure is the consumer, and by association, the family and
consumer science profession. The basic premise of this paper is that
**[this entire infrastructure is a key source of structural violence,
enabled by consumers who, knowingly or unknowingly, embrace the ideology
of consumerism]{.underline}** Johan Galtung (1969) first coined the term
structural violence intending it to refer to the presence of justice
(positive peace) to balance the prevailing focus on negative peace, the
absence of war and violence. Whereas **[direct violence and war are very
visible, structural violence is almost invisible, embedded in ubiquitous
social structures, normalized by stable institutions, and regular
experience]{.underline}**. Because they are longstanding, **[structural
inequities usually seem ordinary, the way things are and always have
been done. Worse yet, even those who are victims of structural violence
often do not see the systematic ways in which their plight is
choreographed by unequal and unfair distribution of society's
resources]{.underline}** or by human constraint caused by economic and
political structures. Unequal access to resources, political power,
education, health care, or legal standing are all forms of structural
violence (Winter & Leighton, 1999). **[Structural violence can also
occur in a society if institutions and policies are designed in such a
way that barriers result in lack of adequate food, housing, health, safe
and just working conditions, education, economic security, clothing, and
family relationships.]{.underline}** People affected by structural
violence tend to live a life of oppression, exclusion, exploitation,
marginalization, collective humiliation, stigmatization, repression,
inequities, and lack of opportunities due to no fault of their own, per
se. **[The people most affected by structural violence]{.underline}**
are women, children, and elders; those from different ethnic, racial,
and religious groups; and sexual orientation. Those adversely affected
by structural violence are not involved in direct conflict that is
readily identifiable. Because they, and others, may not comprehend the
origin of the conflict, they **[feel they are to blame, or are blamed,
for their own life conditions. This perception is readily escalated
because people's perceptual and cognitive processes normally divide
people into in- groups and out-groups. Those outside "our group" lie
outside our scope of interest and justice. They are
invisible]{.underline}**. Injustice that would be instantaneously
confronted if it occurred to someone in "our group" is barely noticed if
it occurs to strangers or those who are invisible and irrelevant. Those
who fall outside "our group" are easily morally excluded and become
demeaned or invisible, so we do not have to acknowledge the injustice
they suffer (Winter & Leighton, 1999). "Consumerism is the drug that
causes people to fall into moral sleep and remain silent on all kinds of
public matters. **[As long as their little world of peace and relative
prosperity is not disturbed, they are happy not to get
involved.]{.underline}** It is against this background of consumer
complacency that all kinds of moral relaxation can arise . . . . A
consumer society is one that is prepared to sacrifice its ethics on the
altar of the material 'feel-good' factor" (Benton, 1998). Persons living
in a consumer society live a comfortable life at the expense of
impoverished labourers and fragile ecosystems in other countries. Too
often, they conclude that they must arm themselves to protect their
commodities and the ongoing access to them. **[This position justifies
war and violence]{.underline}** (Cejka, 2003). **[The "veil of
consumerism" enables them to overlook the connections between
consumerism and oppressive regimes]{.underline}** (governments, world
financial institutions, and transnational corporations**[) that violate
human rights, increase drug trade, and boost military
spending]{.underline}** (Sankofa, 2003). This disregard is possible
because **[consumerism accentuates and accelerates]{.underline}**
**[human fragmentation, isolation, and exclusion for]{.underline}**
**[the profit of the few, contributing significantly to
violence]{.underline}** (Board of the Commission of the Churches on
International Affairs, 1994). Society has ignored the "new slavery" and
the resultant disposable people through ignoring the implications of
consumption decisions on third world citizens, the next generation, and
those not yet born (Sankofa). From yet another perspective, McGregor
(2001) suggests that **[consumerism is also a form of slavery to those
doing the consuming.]{.underline}** She tantalizes us with the ideas
that people behave as they do in a consumer society because they are so
indoctrinated into the logic of the market that **[they cannot "see"
anything wrong with what they are doing. Because they do not critically
challenge the market ideology, and what it means to live in a consumer
society, they actually contribute to their own oppression]{.underline}**
(slaves of the market and capitalism) as well as the oppression of
others who make the goods and of the natural ecosystem. Strong and
unsustainable consumption patterns have developed and have been
unchallenged over a long period of time to the point that consumerism
and structural violence represent dominant forces in human social
interaction, and these forces are transforming human life in powerful
and destructive ways (Santi Pracha Dammha Institute, 2001).

### Asymmetric Survival Impact

#### Capitalism causes violence and widens the gap between the rich and the poor

**Gordon 96** (Wally Gordon; writer; 8/22/1996; "Consumerism as a source
of structural violence";
<http://www.kon.org/hswp/archive/consumerism.pdf>; 7/28/19)

In the current economic system of the Americas, Europe and many other
parts of the world, private individuals or corporations own the means of
production and distribution. **[These exploiters profit from the work of
their employees whose payment is not determined by the value of their
product.]{.underline}** **[They maintain a pool of unemployed with whom
they bargain for labour as if the workers were inanimate
objects.]{.underline}** They are indifferent to poverty, pollution and
environmental deterioration. Advanced technology, instead of being a
benefit to everybody, has reduced the need for workers. These features,
which cannot be repeated often enough, are well known, yet a huge
bureaucracy and millions of shareholders approve and maintain this
iniquitous system. Democrats, Republicans, Conservatives, Liberals, with
meaningless differences, are joined with big business to form a
regulatory machine, satisfied to promote their interests at the expense
of other human beings. Competition is encouraged between individuals,
between communities, between nations, competition for the available
wealth. Competition for jobs fractures the community and diminishes the
power that a monolithic group would possess. **[Young people are being
educated and trained to be competitive, to be able to participate in an
economy which will compete in the international market]{.underline}**.
Successful competition by a national economy is the defeat of some other
national economies. If peaceful techniques are unsuccessful, a country,
perhaps inevitably, will resort to military methods to subdue a
competitor or capture a market. Competition means a winner and losers.
**[The winner has imposed suffering on the losers]{.underline}**. During
and after war all participants suffer. The losers suffer unemployment
and unaffordable food, shelter and social services. Because they do not
have what they need, their indignity, frustration, resentment and
anxiety impel them to become violent. As a release from their
desperation they shoot, knife and bludgeon the per- ceived enemy or
steal articles or money to survive or to support the drug or alcohol
habit which also is an escape from the reality of their suffering.
**[All this is the direct and inevitable result of the exploitative
system of capitalism and accounts for the largest part of human
violence. This system not only breeds violence, but is violence - the
pollution of environ- mental violence, the militarism of political
violence, the maintained unemployment of structural violence. This
structural, institutionalized violence is extended on an international
scale, widening the wealth gap between the rich]{.underline}**, mostly
in the North, **[and the poor]{.underline}**, mostly in the South. Nancy
Lee Wood states that **[this asymmetrical development is
due]{.underline}**, in large part, **[to the global economic
order]{.underline}** - or perhaps more poignantly, disorder - **[of
capitalism]{.underline}**. Maximization of corporate/private profit
necessitates an ever-expanding economy rooted in a reckless denial of
the limits to growth. Such an economy needs and creates the conditions
whereby over- development for the North depends on \'underdevelopment\'
of the South. **[Asymmetrical development is the result of structural
violence created primarily through the exploitation of women and people
of colour, as well as through the destruction of the natural
environment]{.underline}**. Capitalism main- tains the abject poverty or
marginal existence of millions of Americans and four-fifths of the
global population. As emphasized in an open letter to the United Nation
Social Summit 1995, unemployment will increase while computerized
machines and robots function without the need for human workers, and
money and resources are consumed in the development of new technology.
The letter contends that we will all end up with wide- spread violence
and poverty greater than the worst that exists today. Capitalism must
go, taking with it excessive automation, inequality and violence. **[It
is difficult, if not impossible, to survive in a capitalist society and
not cooperate with it.]{.underline}** The food, shelter and security
that people must buy provide profit to the exploiters, so that even
those who disapprove are unavoidably helping to maintain the system.
However, while part of it, they still can work to be rid of it. They
should stress **[the inhuman nature of capitalism]{.underline}** and
should form coalitions of groups which support anti- capitalist
candidates for public office. **[The poor, homeless, jobless, unhealthy
billions exploited under the yoke of capitalism deserve consideration of
an alternative socioeconomic system]{.underline}**. Individuals and
groups must strive to establish a radical democracy that places
people\'s lives under their own control - a non-racist, feminist society
in which people cooperate at work, at home, and in the community.
Support must be given to parties striving to do this. Efforts must be
made to elect enough repre- sentatives in government to introduce a
system of collective ownership of industry and natural resources. But an
independent economic system is unlikely to survive because that system
and other systems would not be interlocked. Every country must be
transformed. Since critical problems due to social and economic
inequality are global, an organization repre- senting all the people on
Earth is required to address them.

### Death Impact

#### Capitalism ensures systemic inequalities that lead to early and unnatural deaths for those in the proletariat

**Tyler and Inwood 14** (James Tyner and Joshua Inwood; Tyner works at
Department of Geography at Kent State University, research centers on
the intersection of political and population geography; Inwood at
University of Tennessee at Knoxville Department of Geography; 1/28/14;
"Violence as fetish: Geography, Marxism, and dialectics";
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132513516177>;
7/28/19)

Capitalism, for example, is a specific historical form of the social
process; its foundation is the separation of direct producers from the
means of production, which is why workers -- although formally free --
are forced by material circumstance to sell their labor-power to the
capitalist, who owns the means of production (Heinrich, 2012: 181[).
Capitalism]{.underline}, in this sense, [appears as a system whereby a
person's capacity to work becomes a commodity that can be bought and
sold on the market. This has a tremendous bearing on the theorization of
violence]{.underline}. For just as each mode of production is structured
according to its class relations, for which there are appropriate
corresponding categories of analysis (Fine and Saad-Filho, 2010: 5), so
too [will each mode of production structure the abstraction of violence
in particular concrete forms.]{.underline} For Marx, capitalism was
predicated upon two key conditions. The first is that 'laborpower can
appear on the market as a commodity only if, and in so far as, its
possessor \... offers it for sale or sells it as a commodity' (Marx,
1990 \[1867\]: 271). The condition, however, holds only if a second
condition is met, namely that 'the possessor of labor-power \...
\[must\] be compelled to offer for sale as a commodity that very
labor-power which exists only in his living body' (p. 272). It was
through the satisfaction of these two conditions that workers appear
free in a double sense: as legally 'free' individuals who are 'free' to
enter into the waged-labor market. The worker, of course, is anything
but free. As Peck (1996: 27) writes, 'in capitalist societies, the
preparedness of workers to offer their labor on the labor market is
largely secured by the systematic erosion of possibilities of
subsistence outside the wage system'. It is, consequently, [Marx's
second condition]{.underline} that [assumes prominence in our
understanding of violence in capitalism]{.underline}. Consider the
well-documented, if still debated, transformation from feudalism to
mercantilism to capitalism. A Marxist perspective begins from the
standpoint of 'primitive accumulation', a term also subject to much
recent debate both within and beyond geography (Glassman, 2006; Harvey,
2003; Li, 2009; McIntyre, 2011). In general, however, this entails the
historical process of separating workers from the means of production;
this may be accomplished via the usurpation of common property,
enclosures of 'common' land, and the destruction of domestic, artisanal
production. In an oft-cited passage, Marx (1990 \[1867\]: 926) says of
primitive accumulation: 'capital comes dripping from head to toe, from
every pore, with blood and dirt'. [Marx's point is not simply that
capitalism is violent; rather, his critique lies in the assertion that
as long as capitalism exists, systemic inequalities are both necessary
and unavoidable.]{.underline} That these structural conditions are not
necessarily considered criminal or necessarily violent is a reflection
of how crime and violence are also 'historically and morally
determined'. For, as Marx recognizes, the standards of 'right' and
'wrong' are not transhistorical or transgeographical but rather
conditioned by the dominant economic (and hence legal) relations of
society. This, certainly, is the point raised by Engels, who, in The
Condition of the Working Class in England, writes: When one individual
inflicts bodily injury upon another, such injury that death results, we
call the deed manslaughter; when the assailant knew in advance that the
injury would be fatal, we call the deed murder. But [when society places
hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a
too early and an unnatural death, one which is quite as much a death by
violence as that by the sword or bullet; when it deprives thousands of
the necessaries of life, places them under conditions in which they
cannot live -- forces them, through the strong arm of the
law,]{.underline} to remain in Tyner and Inwood 777 [such conditions
until that death ensues which is the inevitable consequence -- knows
that these thousands of victims must perish, and yet permits these
conditions to remain, its deed is murder just as surely as the deed of a
single individual; disguised, malicious murder, murder against which
none can defend himself, which does not seem what it is, because no man
sees the murderer, because the death of the victim seems a natural one,
since the offence is more one of omission than of commission. But murder
it remains]{.underline}. (Engels, 2005 \[1845\]: 127) What both Marx and
Engels understood is not just that 'violence' assumes a central role in
the accumulation of capital; rather, they understood that capitalism is
a particular historical (and geographical) mode of production; and that
social relations, such as the relationship to the means of production,
must be described with categories that retain their validity only with
regard to these modes of production (cf. Heinrich, 2012: 32). From Marx
we recognize that 'labor' is not a transhistorical concept; likewise, we
understand that 'race,' sex, and gender appear in different forms in
different times and different places. This suggests, therefore, that any
understanding of 'violence' as a relational process must take seriously
the argument -- put forth most prominently by feminist geographers --
that [violence is first and foremost experienced, embodied, and deeply
personal]{.underline} (cf. England and Simon, 2010; Fluri, 2009; Kedir
and Admasachew, 2010; Koopman, 2011; Pain, 1991, 2001, 2010; Woon, 2011;
Wright, 2010). [It is necessary therefore to refocus future analyses to
that of, for example, violence in feudal Japan, or violence in
neoliberal United States, rather than a search for universal,
essentialist origins and explanations.]{.underline}

### Mundane Violence Impact

#### Violence under capitalism is obscured; the dialectic perspective of the neg is necessary to solve pervasive structural violence in the status quo

**Tyler and Inwood 14** (James Tyner and Joshua Inwood; Tyner works at
Department of Geography at Kent State University, research centers on
the intersection of political and population geography; Inwood at
University of Tennessee at Knoxville Department of Geography; 1/28/14;
"Violence as fetish: Geography, Marxism, and dialectics";
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132513516177>;
7/28/19)

More specifically, a focus on 'intention' as opposed to 'guilt' risks
understating the level of violence within any given society. As Galtung
(1969: 170) explains, 'ethical systems directed against intended
violence will easily fail to capture structural violence in their nets'.
In other words, an artificial distinction between 'direct' and
'structural' violence serves to reproduce existent inequalities in
society; formal and official accountings of violence fail to Tyner and
Inwood 779 capture those actions that reduce one's potentiality because
the fundamental social relations remain hidden. Farmer (2004: 307), for
example, forwards the idea that structural violence 'is violence exerted
systematically -- that is, indirectly -- by everyone who belongs to a
certain social order'. **However,** [the violence in capitalism --
imminently visible in the form of primitive accumulation -- becomes
fetishized beneath the supposed free exchange of labor]{.underline}.
[Any given capitalist is no longer viewed as intentionally or personally
inflicting violence upon his or her workers; and 'direct' violence
magically appears as something 'natural' if not extraordinary, while
'structural' violence appears as an unfortunate and unforeseen
consequence of individual and free decisions.]{.underline} There is a
further complication to the false dichotomy between 'structural' and
'direct' violence as manifest in capitalism, one that exists because of
what we term the social and spatial immediacy of violence. Consider, for
example, acts of 'real' concrete violence, such as rape. In these acts,
there is an immediacy that is clearly present: a man, for example,
raping a woman. In structural violence, however, such as the social
conditions that lead to famine, this immediacy is missing. Those
individuals 'responsible' for the creation of such conditions are
neither readily identifiable nor necessarily in the immediate vicinity;
and indeed, many accounts do not, or cannot, attempt to ascertain those
responsible. Consequently, 'structural' violence simply happens; it is
part of the existing structure of society with no individual to hold
accountable. Critical for us as geographers is the way these relations
are often obscured through the production of space. It is necessary to
move beyond treating violence as simply existing and instead to
materially ground it within the mode of production of a particular
society. This has the possibility to expand our geographic understanding
of the interconnectivity of myriad social, economic, and political
processes. In so doing it will be possible to help our colleagues and
students to see, for example, how the unfettered [capital accumulation
that occurs in the West has life-altering possibilities for billions of
untold peoples around the world and undergirds much of our contemporary
understanding of violence.]{.underline} As a consequence we refuse to
abide by the distinction between structural and direct violence.
Concrete forms of structural violence (e.g. lack of adequate health care
or housing) are manifest in capitalism not as 'unfortunate' by-products
but because of the particular social relations that constitute the
production, circulation, and exchange of capitalism. However, given our
understanding of the sociospatial dialectic, these economic relations
remain hidden; so too are associated forms of violence[. Concrete forms
of violence, such as rape and beatings, are individuated and thus
counted; those concrete forms that perpetuate inequalities in society --
inequalities that facilitate the valorization of capital -- are
discounted and remain veiled from critical scrutiny]{.underline}. It is
incumbent therefore to conceive of 'structural' violence as just as
'direct' as other concrete actions; to dismiss inequalities in society
as unintended consequences is to make disappear the systemic
inequalities that are inherent in capitalist exchange. In the wake of
the US War on/of Terror, Butler asks: Are we not, strategically
speaking, interested in ameliorating this violence? Are we not,
ethically speaking, obligated to stop its further dissemination, to
consider our role in instigating it, and to foment and cultivate another
sense of a culturally and religiously diverse global political culture?
(Butler, 2004: 8--9) We answer an unequivocal yes! [Treating violence
dialectically, in short, is about working towards a more just future in
which those who]{.underline} 780 Progress in Human Geography 38(6)
[defend their privileged position through the ill-conceived dichotomy of
structural versus direct violence can no longer obscure the fact that
their lives are possible because of, not in spite of,
violence.]{.underline} Our argument is born out of a frustration that
current concepts and understandings of violence do very little to
transform the fundamental social relations that undergird society. We
contend instead that considerations of violence must be grounded in a
sociospatial dialectic that has its roots grounded in
historical-materialist understandings. In short, we argue by treating
violence dialectically we can begin to move beyond the geographically
confined and threadbare narratives of 'us versus them' to the more
important and potentially transformative questions that constitute the
multiplicity of subjectivities that are dealt with violently.

### Private Military Complex Impact

#### The profit and influence derived from militarization sustains the private military complex creates more powerful military and police forces

**Marshall 09** (Shana Marshall; Shana Marshall is Associate Director of
the Institute for Middle East Studies and Assistant Research Professor.
Her dissertation, "The New Politics of Patronage: The Arms Trade and
Clientelism in the Arab World" examined how Middle East governments use
arms sales agreements to channel financial resources and economic
privileges to pro-regime elites. Prior to GW, Dr. Marshall was a fellow
at The Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University and

**[A UN report on PMSCs noted that Once a greater degree of security has
been attained, the firm apparently begins to exploit the concessions it
has achieved by setting up a number of associates and affiliates which
engage in such varying activities as air transport, road building and
import and export, thereby acquiring a significant if not hegemonic,
presence in the economic life of the country in which it is operating.38
This phenomenon leads to the militarization of the private
sector]{.underline}**, often **[placing third world military elites who
cooperate with the PMSC in a privileged position vis a vis other actors
in the domestic economy. These additional financial resources made
available to developing country military officials and their
institutional interests often enable them to operate profitable
businesses where other actors may fail to do so]{.underline}**. However,
because many businesses and interests owned by military officials or
institutions are 'off-thebooks' the infusions of public capital are
hidden, and inefficient and unprofitable private ventures are often
lauded as examples of superior military organization and technological
know-how. **[This perception encourages investors to seek out domestic
military businesses or individual officers as partners when engaging in
joint ventures, contributing to a cycle which only further increases
their dominance of the economy.]{.underline}**40 **[The symbiotic
relationship between developed country defense industries and developing
country security sectors]{.underline}** also **[results in military and
police forces that are more institutionally powerful within their own
countries with respect to their civilian bureaucratic
counterparts.]{.underline}** Evidence of this would be the increasing
budget that military and police forces have been able to secure in the
wake of ever-increasing subsidy cuts, demands for decreases in
government spending, and cuts in service delivery to the poor.41 Unlike
civilian bureaucracies, militaries have been able to escape these
austerity reforms for political reasons, not least of which are the
powerful weapons manufacturing lobbies that have headquarters in the
capitals of major procuring countries and can pressure the international
financial institutions to rescind demands for slashes in defense
spending.42 Despite rhetoric about budget cuts, few developing countries
have significantly slashed their military spending. Even when cuts make
it into the conditionality agreements of the international financial
institutions, they often fall prey to political considerations.43 It is
illustrative that, although the US State Department has slashed economic
aid to Egypt (it fell below \$500 million in 2006, the lowest since the
Camp David agreements in 1979), it recently announced a plan to lock in
\$13 billion in military aid over the next ten years, not counting the
'cash flow financing' option unique to key US-allies that allows them to
spread out their payments for arms shipments over many years or the
Excess Defense Articles program that allows the Pentagon to transfer
overstocks of combat material to allies free of charge.44 **[Economic
reform processes in the developing world that restrict government
spending can result in the dismantling of already insufficient oversight
and regulatory agencies, a process parallel to that occurring in the
defense industry in the US, resulting in transition economies that
privilege corrupt oligarchies and kleptocratic ruling
parties.45]{.underline}**

### Depression Impact 

#### **Contradictory class locations increase anxiety and depression consistent with job strain and economic pressure**

**Prins, Bates, Keyes & Muntaner 15** (Seth J. Prins, Lisa M. Bates,

anxiety in the United States";
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609238/#R76>; accessed:

Despite a well-established social gradient for many mental disorders,
**[evidence suggests that individuals near the middle of the social
hierarchy suffer higher rates of depression and anxiety than those at
the top]{.underline}** or bottom. Although prevailing indicators of
socioeconomic stratification (e.g., SES) cannot detect or easily explain
such patterns, relational theories of social class, which emphasise
political-economic processes and dimensions of power, might. We test
whether **[the relational construct of contradictory class location,
which embodies aspects of both ownership and labour, can explain this
nonlinear pattern.]{.underline}** **[Data on full-time workers from the
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions
(N=21,859) show that occupants of contradictory class locations have
higher prevalence and odds of depression and anxiety than occupants of
non-contradictory class locations. These findings suggest that the
effects of class relations on depression and anxiety extend beyond those
of SES, pointing to under-studied mechanisms in social epidemiology,
e.g., domination and exploitation. Social disadvantage is associated
with higher risk of most adverse mental health outcomes]{.underline}**
(Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend 1969; Dohrenwend 1990; Faris and Dunham 1988;
Hollingshead and Redlich 1953; Muntaner and Ng et al. 2013). Indeed,
**[disparities in both mental and physical health are firmly established
across traditional measures of socioeconomic status]{.underline}** (SES)
such as **[income, educational attainment, and other indicators of
social rank]{.underline}** (Lynch and Kaplan 2000; Muntaner and Ng et
al. 2013). These measures capture---and their theoretical underpinnings
predict---an inverse linear, gradational relationship between SES and
physical and mental illness (Mackenbach and Kunst et al. 1997; Marmot
and Smith et al. 1991). There is evidence, however, that individuals
toward the middle of social hierarchies might actually suffer higher
rates of internalising affective disorders such as depression and
anxiety than those at either the top or bottom (Wohlfarth 1997; Muntaner
and Eaton et al. 1998; Muntaner and Borrell et al. 2003). Such patterns
are neither detected nor easily explained by standard approaches. Using
traditional measures of SES, research since at least the 1930s has
consistently documented that **[mental illnesses are more common among
those with lower levels of income, education, and occupational
prestige]{.underline}** (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend 1969; Faris and
Dunham 1988; Hollingshead and Redlich 1953; Kessler and Cleary 1980;
Link and Lennon et al. 1993). Studies such as Whitehall I and II have
generated important insights about the social production and
distribution of health disparities by establishing social gradients in
physical and mental health (Marmot and Brunner 2005; Marmot and Smith et
al. 1991; Stansfeld and North et al. 1995; Stansfeld and Head et al.
1998). Early on, these studies identified an "unexplained residual"
social gradient after accounting for standard risk factors (Marmot and
Rose et al. 1978), and this motivated considerable scholarship and
debate on potential additional causes and mechanisms that do not operate
through the pathway of behaviourally mediated proximal risk factors.
These generative insights prompted substantial research effort focused
on relative versus absolute deprivation (Lynch and Smith et al. 2000)
and workplace stress and its social construction (e.g., Wainwright and
Calnan 2002). The granular occupational status hierarchies and longevity
of the Whitehall cohorts have also facilitated productive investigations
of social causation versus social selection mechanisms (e.g., Elovainio
and Ferrie et al. 2011), complimenting earlier tests of the
causation/selection debate as it pertained to psychiatric disorders
(e.g., Dohrenwend and Levav et al. 1992). Using a relational measure of
class, we found that **[individuals who occupy more contradictory class
locations have higher prevalence and odds of depression and anxiety than
individuals in less contradictory class locations]{.underline}**. As
such, individuals' relation to production results in patterns of
depression and anxiety distinct from those seen with traditional SES
measures. These findings confirm results from prior studies that used
measures of class based on the same neo-Marxian theory employed here
(Muntaner and Eaton et al. 1998; Muntaner and Borrell et al. 2003), but
extend the evidence by using nationally representative data that
captures the contemporary national class structure in the United States.
The finding that supervisors and managers tend to have higher prevalence
and odds of depression and anxiety than both owners and workers is
important for understanding the aetiology of depression and anxiety
vis-à-vis social stress theory, and has implications for measuring SES
versus class. **[Regarding stress theory, our findings suggest that
class relations may structure exposure to depressogenic and anxiogenic
occupations, and that stresses from workplace domination and
exploitation may extend beyond those associated with the relative
material disadvantage that is a consequence of domination and
exploitation]{.underline}**. While social stress theory does not
preclude a diversity of stressors and stress reactions that have
different effects on physical and mental health, our findings imply that
the social distribution of some labour-related stressors may not fit a
stratificationist framework that views said distribution linearly, along
a social gradient (e.g., Adler and Boyce et al. 2013; Braveman and
Cubbin et al. 2005; Kunst and Geurts et al. 1995; Mackenbach and Kunst
et al. 1997; Marmot and Smith et al. 1991). **[Contradictory class
locations may entail greater exposure to exogenous stressors consistent
with the job strain model.]{.underline}** **[They may also have an
impact on individuals' interpretations of and responses to stressors
encountered as a function of class location.]{.underline}** Thus, it may
not only be the social position that one occupies, but how one came to
occupy and ascribe meaning to it, that has implications for depression
and anxiety. For example, **[relation to production may play a role in
individuals' attributional dispositions,]{.underline}** wherein
low-level supervisors attribute their occupational conditions as
resulting from internal, personal failings, **[where]{.underline}**as
**[workers attribute their exploitation, alienation, and lower levels of
occupational control to factors external to themselves.]{.underline}**
Research has consistently shown that external attributions are
protective against low self-esteem and internalising disorders such as
depression (Abramson and Metalsky et al. 1989; Weiner 1985).

### Human Rights Impact

#### Capitalism excuses human rights violations in the name of profit- sweeping the suffering of millions under the rug 

**Song 15**( Alan Song; writer for the New Internationalist, PhD
student, and human rights worker; March 10, 2015; "Capitalism and Human
Rights Abuses Go Together Like Yin and Yang";
<https://newint.org/blog/2015/03/10/capitalism-abuse>; accessed July 28,
2019)

Anti-communist, pro-capitalist propagandists will point to the violent
nature of Stalin's five-year-plans or to Pol Pot's social cleansing.
'Look, it's all well and good in theory, but in practice it's the most
violent system,' they say. Capitalism, on the other hand, is the
religion of peace. This simplistic logic is not only grossly flawed but
contributes to a convenient narrative to delegitimize any movement that
is not pro-markets, which has been the status quo since the end of the
Second World War. In that period, **[capitalist economics have become
the modus operandi for the Western world and have been (violently)
pushed onto the rest of the world]{.underline}**. This has become so
accepted as the triumphant system over the evils of communism, that the
end of the Cold War was famously (and incorrectly) regarded as 'The End
of History' by US political scientist and economist Francis Fukuyama.
What **[this narrative]{.underline}** does, though, is **[whitewash the
crimes of capitalism, which is conveniently exonerated of its sins,
while an association is made between violence and any alternative
system, so as to continue to position capitalism on higher moral and
economic ground.]{.underline}** On closer inspection, however, it is
difficult to disagree with the fact that capitalism is almost
undoubtedly the most violent economic system of recent times,
responsible for more deaths and more social disruption than any other.
Even if in much of the industrialized and developed capitalist word
there is the veneer of a state of peace, capitalism, as a system, is
maintained and upheld through violence, both overtly and in more subtle
ways. **[Western expansion, slavery and colonialism are inherently tied
to white, patriarchal, capitalist economics that are still in play
today. Capitalism has claimed millions of lives and has led to violence
as a result of structural adjustment programmes forced on former
colonies by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. There
was the Belgian Congo holocaust. Or what was essentially the ethnic
cleansing of an entire continent in South America resulting from Spanish
and Portuguese capitalist expansion during the colonial era. Yet when we
discuss capitalism we tend not to discuss the violence associated with
it. In terms of death tolls, the violence of colonialism cannot be
over-stated. The slave trade, colonialism and neo-colonialism have
contributed to untold numbers of dead.]{.underline}** Even something
such as the war in Iraq can be linked to capitalism when we look at the
embedded nature of arms companies within the Western state apparatus, as
well as the fact that access to oil resources was a motivating factor
for invading. **[Capitalism and human rights abuses go together like yin
and yang. People might detach themselves from concern about how the
chips in their iPhones are made, but in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, human rights abuses are taking place on a daily basis so that
Western firms can exploit cobalt resources. It's not just overt violence
that works to underpin capitalism. There is also ideological violence:
capitalism relies on subtle forms of coercion to sustain a system of
domination and exploitation made possible through the existence of a
social hierarchy. Anyone who isn't a white, straight man is in a
position of disadvantage and is inherently discriminated
against]{.underline}**. As philosopher Slavoj Zizek puts it in his book,
Violence, this 'ultra-objective **[or systematic violence':'is inherent
in the social conditions of global capitalism, which involves the
"automatic" creation of excluded and dispensable individuals, from the
homeless to the unemployed, and the "ultra-subjective" violence of newly
emerging ethnic and/or religious, in the short, racist
"fundamentalisms."']{.underline}** Such oppression is rarely considered
violence; it is seen as an unfortunate by-product of competition, rather
than an essential component of a corrupt system. The violence of
capitalism has for a long time benefited a ruling elite who continue to
prosper ( 1 per cent of the world's population controls 50 per cent of
the world's wealth). **[Capitalism systematically oppresses people at
the bottom of the social 'food chain' and is reliant for its continued
existence on an underbelly of the poor and powerless.]{.underline}**
There is no fast or easy solution. But what we can do is have an open
conversation about capitalism and the ways in which it has been
sustaining itself. And we can be more critical of the media
representation of violence waged by Western states, which is often
presented as benevolent, rather than as the result of a violent
capitalist agenda.

### Derealisation Impact

#### Dispossession is an invisible impact and outweighs -- the lives of millions of workers all around the world are derealized, effaced from the record or tally of violence to suit corporate interests. This shifts the locus of impact calculus -- capitalism hollows public discourse to neglect from the structural violence necessary for so called neutral calculus. 

**Varman & Al-Moudi '16** (Rohit Varman is a professor of Marketing and
Consumption at Birmingham Business School; Al-Moudi is a Professor of
department People, Organizations and Society at the University of
Cambridge; "Accumulation through derealisation: How corporate violence
remains unchecked")

**[Derealizing dispossessed farmers by influencing official reports. We
collected accounts of dispossession of natural resources that were
articulable in villagers' private accounts while being systematically
excluded from legally acceptable accounts. Villagers question the
clearance given by the state pollution-control department to Coca-Cola,
and claim that the firm has sufficient financial power to buy the
government machinery and influence their findings]{.underline}**. The
villagers claim that Coca-Cola's managers refused to listen to them
whenever they approached them. Rahmat, a farmer, indicated that when he
tried to approach a Coca-Cola official, who had come to assess the
quality of wastewater, he was told rudely, 'hamara dimag mat kharab karo
\[don't trouble me\]. Hato rasta chodo \[get out of my way\]'.
Anti-Coca-Cola activists and villagers accuse Coca-Cola of fraudulent
practices, and of bribing local village and state officials to gain
support. According to Lok Dal's Rupam, 'Coca-Cola bribes panchayat
officials by giving them mobile phones, clothes, utensils, and by
providing them with hand pumps'. For instance, villagers believed that
in order to show that Coca-Cola was not having a harmful impact on the
local environment, government officials, in collusion with the firm,
collected only samples of good water and soil for testing. Rahmat
further claimed that: They collect good water from the hand pump. One
fellow was taking water, and I asked him why he was taking good water.
Then he said for testing. They fill good water from hand pumps and wells
and collect good soil from the fields. **[The decline of underground
water exacerbates the problem of access to water in the region. Several
farmers complained that the underground water levels had gone down in
the last decade, and there was a risk of the extinction of
aquifers.]{.underline}** Farmers blame CocaCola for their plight and
claim that the firm is siphoning millions of litres of water every day
with its powerful pumps. Yogendra, a farmer and a member of Gaon Bachaon
Dal, informed us, 'It used to take five hours to irrigate my farm
earlier. Previously water level was high now it has gone down, it takes
more time to irrigate my farm. It sometimes takes 15 hours'. Another
farmer Ulhas informed us: There used to be water everywhere when we were
kids. We used to go to school in water. There used to be a lot of rain
now there is no rain. Water was available at 25 to 30 feet; now it is
available at 150 feet. In our area of Mehdiganj, people are very much
affected by Coca-Cola. It has bored a 500--600 feet deep well that draws
a lot of water. **[These farmers believe that Coca-Cola and the state
have dismissed their concerns, and their resources are taken away by a
large private enterprise. Although independent hydrological reports
produced by university professors corroborate the claims of villagers,
the latter do not have access to the data collected by the state
authority and have no ability to make claims that can withstand legal
scrutiny]{.underline}**. **[When we tried to get the data on underground
water from one of the offices in a nearby city, we were asked to go from
one desk to another and then from one office to another office before
being told to go to the state capital to get the data. Despite these
efforts, we could not get the data]{.underline}**. **[Derealizing
protesting workers through the threat of the sack. We found that the
threat of the sack is actively used as a form of violence to silence the
work force and to derealize subalterns, whose pleas remain in the
ellipses of public discourse]{.underline}**. **[Coca-Cola keeps its
workers under a continuous threat of the sack, a threat that acts as a
potent silencing mechanism in conditions of high
unemployment.]{.underline}** Prem, an ex-Coca-Cola worker, confirms
Salamat's testimony (supra) on the systematic threatening of those
claiming their labour rights: Interviewer: Minimum wage is more than Rs
90/- \[1.5 US\$\] per day. Prem: They pay Rs 75/- inside the plant and
Rs 60/- outside the plant. I: Don't you protest for minimum wages? Prem:
If someone protests then he is told that he is indulging in union
activities and is thrown out ... A lot of people come here for work, and
sometimes they get work, but mostly they are made to stand in front of
the gate \[and are not given any job\]. Workers work under contractors,
and all contracts go to people who are very powerful. Coca-Cola exploits
its workers. Instead of the usual eight hours, workers are forced to
work for 12 hours \[without any overtime payment\]. **[Still, there is
so much poverty and unemployment that people come here for work. Prem's
account indicates that Coca-Cola can get away with the exploitative
conditions and violence because of poverty and unemployment levels in
the region. The expression 'a lot of people' is an important part of
this narrative as it refers to a reserve army of workers that renders
demands for better working conditions ineffective.]{.underline}** We
concur with Patnaik's (2013) observation that in such settings, 'the
place of the Monseigneur's whip is taken by the threat of the sack.
Anyone who is suspected to be a laggard is given the sack and the fear
of this happening makes people work'. **[Thus, physical coercion is not
needed to silence workers, and violence in the form of threats can
create the desired outcome of a docile workforce. Villagers further
informed us that Coca-Cola got workers from outside Mehdiganj to lower
the bargaining power of the local workers.]{.underline}** Soumyen told
us: 'Workers are getting low wages. People are also not getting jobs.
Biharis (from another state) are working after coming here ... Local
people are not getting jobs and people of Bihar are coming and are
working'. Villagers further recalled that when an attempt was made to
form a union by some of the workers, Coca-Cola fired them and got
workers from outside as replacements**[. Since most of these were
temporary contract workers, it was easy for Coca-Cola to fire them
without any legal liability.]{.underline}** The workers coming from
outside the region have no local linkages and support groups, and help
Coca-Cola to drive down the wages without much resistance. When we
questioned a Coca-Cola manager about wage payments, he told us that the
firm pays the wage bill to the contractors according to the minimum wage
law. In this instance, responsibility is again passed to the contractors
hiring workers. According to Indian law, the responsibility to pay
minimum wages is shared by contractors and principal employers (namely,
Coca-Cola). However, as with other aspects of the case, workers claim
Coca-Cola overlooks this legal responsibility, while state officials
continue to ignore violations. Similarly, during one of our visits to
Mehdiganj a worker who had developed skin problems on his feet was
brought to us. We could see that his feet were covered with blisters,
and he was in visible pain. **[He and the activists told us that in the
process of working at the Coca-Cola plant the chemicals used for
cleaning the bottles went inside his shoes and caused the skin
problem.]{.underline}** The plight of such workers is a standard part of
public speeches given by anti-Coca-Cola activists but is ignored by the
state authorities and dismissed by Coca-Cola management. Workers believe
that state officials are broadly aware of such instances of legal
violations but choose to overlook them in favour of more powerful
business interests**[. And under the threat of losing their jobs,
workers have no choice but to maintain silence on the violence they face
from Coca-Cola. Derealizing active citizens by bypassing
panchayats]{.underline}**. **[Our field study revealed that the pleas of
villagers against violence do not circulate through political
institutions. The result is an elliptic public discourse that can hardly
be mobilized by subaltern groups, whose lives are made
ungrievable]{.underline}**. The problems in Mehdiganj have to be
understood in the context of subaltern groups' disenfranchisement. In
India, the panchayat or the village council is the basic state body and
is responsible for administering a village. In the 73rd Amendment to the
constitution in 1992, panchayats were given a constitutional status with
the state rhetoric of making it the cornerstone of local
self-governance. These panchayats are administered by blocks, which in
turn are managed by taluq and district-level administrative bodies. The
villagers elect members of a panchayat, including its Pradhan
(President), through a secret ballot. Despite the promises of
self-governance and deepening of democracy, it is widely accepted that
panchayats remain weak institutions with little power to govern their
constituencies (Upadhyay, 2002). **[Access to panchayats plays a
critical role in local confrontations and political
mobilizations]{.underline}**. **[The subaltern groups in Mehdiganj
complained that their access to such institutions and their ability to
mobilize support were limited. Several participants told us that the
panchayat in Mehdiganj refused to register their complaints against
Coca-Cola. They claimed that Coca-Cola regularly bribed the Pradhan and
other members of the panchayat. We also found that certain segments of
the village are without any voice mechanism.]{.underline}** These
subaltern groups comprising women and lower caste groups believe that a
patriarchal and caste-based system disenfranchises and silences them
(see Spivak, 1988). Uma, a resident of Bhikaripur, said that she could
not lodge a complaint against CocaCola to the village panchayat because
she was a woman: We are women, how can we speak? They do not listen to
us. We do not know what happens. People who are not getting affected
\[by Coca-Cola\] go and make speeches that there is no harm \[owing to
Coca-Cola\]. They do not know anything, and they speak on our behalf ...
Whoever benefits, people who are getting saris, whose crops are not
getting destroyed, they are telling that Coca-Cola is good. Uma further
reveals that Coca-Cola regularly distributes gifts to villagers who have
a positive disposition toward the firm. Coca-Cola bypasses subaltern
groups and offers these benefits to some of the rich and powerful
villagers, many of whom are members of the local panchayat. Supporting
this view, Harshal, a small farmer, said the wastewater from the
Coca-Cola plant destroyed his plant and that the panchayat refused to
hear his complaint against this act of violence. It also appeared that
those panchayat members who might identify with villagers' pleas lack
the time, wealth and training needed for their roles to keep violence in
check -- hence the surprise of one of the authors in the following
dialogue with Abhi, an agricultural worker in Mehdiganj who was a member
of the local panchayat: I: What are the wages now? Abhi: Rs 50/- and if
I work harder then Rs 60/-. I: Do you get money or grains as wages?
Abhi: They give money also but generally we get grains. Whatever is the
crop, like wheat or paddy, we get the same. I: How many hours do you
work? Abhi: 10 hours. I: For 10 hours of work, you get only Rs 60/-?
Abhi: Yes. I: Do you know the Government rate? Abhi: No. I: You were a
member of the panchayat and you do not know about Government rates? I
know that I keep repeating this, but I am surprised. Abhi: Who has got
disposable time for panchayat? If I will do panchayat's job then what
will I eat (agar panchayati karaingey to khayaingey kya)? **[The above
exchange indicates that local institutions such as the panchayat that
were created to empower and include subaltern groups at grassroots have
had only limited success. The poverty experienced by the poor in the
region makes it difficult for them to actively participate in these
local institutions and to organize as a political group to negotiate
with the state]{.underline}**. In this light, poverty appears as a
self-reinforcing mechanism that denies citizenship and excludes people
from democratic decision-making processes. Villagers are unable to
articulate their pleas in the idioms of state institutions, and elected
officials lack the means necessary to fulfil their responsibilities.
**[It becomes a vicious circle in which those who are trapped in poverty
cannot devote the time needed to participate in governance processes
that can alleviate their state]{.underline}**. However, this outcome is
also a structural feature of a class-based capitalist order in which a
vast majority is kept poor with low wages to create a pliant labour
force. **[Hence, this process of derealization is only partially
self-created is more of a structural feature of capitalism as it
prevails in the setting. Moreover, politicians in urban centres have
little incentive to invest resources (staff, people, institutional
reorganization) to give voice to subalterns or keep violence in
check.]{.underline}** We understand this neglect as a result of the
political consensus in neoliberal India. The state has replaced the
welfare policies created in post-independence India by marketcentric
interventions that benefit privileged sections (Chandra, 2010; Patnaik,
2007). A policy convergence on neoliberal reforms across mainstream
political parties in the country deprives voters of any real alternative
through the electoral process. The dominant political parties actively
employ intrinsically biased indicators (such as GDP and its growth) that
favour activities that generate monetary exchanges. This has created
emphases on finance capital, services and manufacturing in contemporary
India. In the new development discourse, agriculture, which employs the
majority of the rural population and has witnessed a slower growth rate
in the last 20 years, is considered a bottleneck that needs to be
replaced by the higher economic growth activities of urban India
(Sainath, 2010; Sharma, 2009). The neglect of rural areas is not the act
of any single actor but results from a complex configuration. **[Our
study shows that Coca-Cola has benefited from this neglect to bypass the
panchayats. By doing so, Coca-Cola has also contributed to derealization
of the people of Mehdiganj while negating their identities as active
citizens]{.underline}**.

## Alternatives

### Revolutionary Theory Alt

#### **The alternative is a commitment to a marxist revolutionary theory that connects in solidarity with anti-capitalist movements that are rising all over the globe. Building solidarity through different sphere of productions is key -- communism emerges out of the dialectical movement of labour and resistance that continually challenge capitalism through strategic interventions at every level of society. Centering the structure of capitalism is critical to organizing class resistance and building enduring political forms of communism.** 

**Harvey 09** (David-Harvey;  British Marxist economic geographer and
professor of anthropology and geography at CUNY, 12/16/09, "Organizing
for the Anti-Capitalist Transition",
<http://davidharvey.org/2009/12/organizing-for-the-anti-capitalist-transition/>)

**[The difference between socialism and communism is worth noting.
Socialism aims to democratically manage and regulate capitalism in ways
that calm its excesses and redistribute its benefits for the common
good. It is about spreading the wealth around through progressive
taxation arrangements while basic needs -- such as education, health
care and even housing -- are provided by the state out of reach of
market forces. Many of the key achievements of redistributive socialism
in the period after 1945, not only in Europe but beyond, have become so
socially embedded as to be immune from neoliberal
assault.]{.underline}** Even in the United States, Social Security and
Medicare are extremely popular programs that right wing forces find it
almost impossible to dislodge. The Thatcherites in Britain could not
touch national health care except at the margins. Social provision in
Scandinavia and most of Western Europe seems to be an unshakable
bed-rock of the social order. Communism, on the other hand, seeks to
displace capitalism by creating an entirely different mode of both
production and distribution of goods and services. **[In the history of
actually existing communism, social control over production, exchange
and distribution meant state control and systematic state planning. In
the long-run this proved to be unsuccessful]{.underline}** though,
interestingly, its conversion in China (and its earlier adoption in
places like Singapore) has proven far more successful than the pure
neoliberal model in generating capitalist growth for reasons that cannot
be elaborated upon here. Contemporary attempts to revive the communist
hypothesis typically abjure state control and look to other forms of
collective social organization to displace market forces and capital
accumulation as the basis for organizing production and distribution.
Horizontally networked as opposed to hierarchically commanded systems of
coordination between autonomously organized and self-governing
collectives of producers and consumers are envisaged as lying at the
core of a new form of communism. Contemporary technologies of
communication make such a system seem feasible. All manner of
small-scale experiments around the world can be found in which such
economic and political forms are being constructed. In this there is a
convergence of some sort between the Marxist and anarchist traditions
that harks back to the broadly collaborative situation between them in
the 1860s in Europe. While nothing is certain, it could be that 2009
marks the beginning of a prolonged shake out in which the question of
grand and far-reaching alternatives to capitalism will step-by-step
bubble up to the surface in one part of the world or another. The longer
the uncertainty and the misery is prolonged, the more the legitimacy of
the existing way of doing business will be questioned and the more the
demand to build something different will escalate. Radical as opposed to
band-aid reforms to patch up the financial system may seem more
necessary**[. The uneven development of capitalist practices throughout
the world has produced, moreover, anti-capitalist movements all over the
place. The state-centric economies of much of East Asia generate
different discontents (as in Japan and China) compared to the churning
anti-neoliberal struggles occurring throughout much of Latin America
where the Bolivarian revolutionary movement of popular power exists in a
peculiar relationship to capitalist class interests that have yet to be
truly confronted. Differences over tactics and policies in response to
the crisis among the states that make up the European Union are
increasing]{.underline}** even as a second attempt to come up with a
unified EU constitution is under way. **[Revolutionary and resolutely
anti-capitalist movements are also to be found, though not all of them
are of a progressive sort, in many of the marginal zones of capitalism.
Spaces have been opened up within which something radically different in
terms of dominant social relations, ways of life, productive capacities
and mental conceptions of the world can flourish.]{.underline}** This
applies as much to the Taliban and to communist rule in Nepal as to the
Zapatistas in Chiapas and indigenous movements in Bolivia, the Maoist
movements in rural India, even as they are world's apart in objectives,
strategies and tactics. The central problem is that in aggregate there
is no resolute and **[sufficiently unified anti-capitalist movement that
can adequately challenge the reproduction of the capitalist class and
the perpetuation of its power on the world stage. Neither is there any
obvious way to attack the bastions of privilege for capitalist elites or
to curb their inordinate money power and military might. While openings
exist towards some alternative social order, no one really knows where
or what it is. But just because there is no political force capable of
articulating let alone mounting such a program, this is no reason to
hold back on outlining alternatives.]{.underline}** Lenin's famous
question "what is to be done?" cannot be answered, to be sure, without
some sense of who it is might do it where. But a global anti-capitalist
movement is unlikely to emerge without some animating vision of what is
to be done and why. A double blockage exists: the lack of an alternative
vision prevents the formation of an oppositional movement, while the
absence of such a movement precludes the articulation of an alternative.
How, then, can this blockage be transcended? The relation between the
vision of what is to be done and why, and the formation of a political
movement across particular places to do it has to be turned into a
spiral. Each has to reinforce the other if anything is actually to get
done. Otherwise potential opposition will be forever locked down into a
closed circle that frustrates all prospects for constructive change,
leaving us vulnerable to perpetual future crises of capitalism with
increasingly deadly results. Lenin's question demands an answer. The
central problem to be addressed is clear enough. Compound growth for
ever is not possible and the troubles that have beset the world these
last thirty years signal that a limit is looming to continuous capital
accumulation that cannot be transcended except by creating fictions that
cannot last. Add to this the facts that so many people in the world live
in conditions of abject poverty, that environmental degradations are
spiraling out of control, that human dignities are everywhere being
offended even as the rich are piling up more and more wealth (the number
of billionaires in India doubled last year from 27 to 52) under their
command and that the levers of political, institutional, judicial,
military and media power are under such tight but dogmatic political
control as to be incapable of doing much more than perpetuating the
status quo and frustrating discontent. **[A revolutionary politics that
can grasp the nettle of endless compound capital accumulation and
eventually shut it down as the prime motor of human history, requires a
sophisticated understanding of how social change occurs. The failings of
past endeavors to build a lasting socialism and communism have to be
avoided and lessons from that immensely complicated history must be
learned. Yet the absolute necessity for a coherent anti-capitalist
revolutionary movement must also be recognized. The fundamental aim of
that movement is to assume social command over both the production and
distribution of surpluses. We urgently need an explicit revolutionary
theory suited to our times. I propose a "co-revolutionary theory"
derived from an understanding of Marx's account of how capitalism arose
out of feudalism. Social change arises through the dialectical unfolding
of relations between seven moments within the body politic of capitalism
viewed as an ensemble or assemblage of activities and practices: a)
technological and organizational forms of production, exchange and
consumption b) relations to nature c) social relations between people d)
mental conceptions of the world, embracing knowledges and cultural
understandings and beliefs e) labor processes and production of specific
goods, geographies, services or affects]{.underline}** f )
institutional, legal and governmental arrangements g) the conduct of
daily life that underpins social reproduction. Each one of these moments
is internally dynamic and internally marked by tensions and
contradictions (just think of mental conceptions of the world) but all
of them are co-dependent and co-evolve in relation to each other. The
transition to capitalism entailed a mutually supporting movement across
all seven moments. New technologies could not be identified and
practices without new mental conceptions of the world (including that of
the relation to nature and social relations). Social theorists have the
habit of taking just one of the these moments and viewing it as the
"silver bullet" that causes all change. We have technological
determinists (Tom Friedman), environmental determinists (Jarad Diamond),
daily life determinists (Paul Hawkin), labor process determinists (the
autonomistas), institutionalists, and so on and so forth. They are all
wrong. It is the dialectical motion across all of these moments that
really counts even as there is uneven development in that motion.
**[When capitalism itself undergoes one of its phases of renewal, it
does so precisely by co-evolving all moments, obviously not without
tensions, struggles, fights and contradictions. But consider how these
seven moments were configured around 1970 before the neoliberal surge
and consider how they look now and you will see they have all changed in
ways that re-define the operative characteristics of capitalism viewed
as a non-Hegelian totality. An anti-capitalist political movement can
start anywhere (in labor processes, around mental conceptions, in the
relation to nature, in social relations, in the design of revolutionary
technologies and organizational forms, out of daily life or through
attempts to reform institutional and administrative structures including
the reconfiguration of state powers). The trick is to keep the political
movement moving from one moment to another in mutually reinforcing
ways]{.underline}**. **[This was how capitalism arose out of feudalism
and this is how something radically different called communism,
socialism or whatever must arise out of capitalism. Previous attempts to
create a communist or socialist alternative fatally failed to keep the
dialectic between the different moments in motion and failed to embrace
the unpredictabilities and uncertainties in the dialectical movement
between them. Capitalism has survived precisely by keeping the
dialectical movement between the moments going and constructively
embracing the inevitable tensions, including crises, that result. Change
arises, of course, out of an existing state of affairs and it has to
harness the possibilities immanent within an existing
situation.]{.underline}** Since the existing situation varies enormously
from Nepal, to the Pacific regions of Bolivia, to the deindustrializing
cities of Michigan and the still booming cities of Mumbai and Shanghai
and the shaken but by no means destroyed financial centers of New York
and London, so all manner of experiments in social change in different
places and at different geographical scales are both likely and
potentially illuminating as ways to make (or not make) another world
possible. And in each instance it may seem as if one or other aspect of
the existing situation holds the key to a different political future.
**[But the first rule for a global anti-capitalist movement must be:
never rely on the unfolding dynamics of one moment without carefully
calibrating how relations with all the others are adapting and
reverberating. Feasible future possibilities arise out of the existing
state of relations between the different moments. Strategic political
interventions within and across the spheres can gradually move the
social order onto a different developmental path.]{.underline}** This is
what wise leaders and forward looking institutions do all the time in
local situations, so there is no reason to think there is anything
particularly fantastic or utopian about acting in this way. The left has
to look to build alliances between and across those working in the
distinctive spheres. An **[anti-capitalist movement has to be far
broader than groups mobilizing around social relations or over questions
of daily life in themselves. Traditional hostilities between, for
example, those with technical, scientific and administrative expertise
and those animating social movements on the ground have to be addressed
and overcome. We now have to hand, in the example of the climate change
movement, a significant example of how such alliances can begin to work.
In this instance the relation to nature is the beginning point, but
everyone realizes that something has to give on all the other moments
and while there is a wishful politics that wants to see the solution as
purely technological, it becomes clearer by the day that daily life,
mental conceptions, institutional arrangements, production processes and
social relations have to be involved. And all of that means a movement
to restructure capitalist society as a whole and to confront the growth
logic that underlies the problem in the first place.]{.underline}**
There have, however, to be, some loosely agreed upon common objectives
in any transitional movement. Some general guiding norms can be set
down. These might include (and I just float these norms here for
discussion) respect for nature, radical egalitarianism in social
relations, institutional arrangements based in some sense of common
interests and common property, democratic administrative procedures (as
opposed to the monetized shams that now exist), labor processes
organized by the direct producers, daily life as the free exploration of
new kinds of social relations and living arrangements, mental
conceptions that focus on self-realization in service to others and
technological and organizational innovations oriented to the pursuit of
the common good rather than to supporting militarized power,
surveillance and corporate greed. These could be the co-revolutionary
points around which social action could converge and rotate. Of course
this is utopian! But so what! We cannot afford not to be. Let me detail
one particular aspect of the problem which arise in the place where I
work. Ideas have consequences and false ideas can have devastating
consequences. Policy failures based on erroneous economic thinking
played a crucial role in both the run-up to the debacle of the 1930s and
in the seeming inability to find an adequate way out. Though there is no
agreement among historians and economists as to exactly what policies
failed, it is agreed that the knowledge structure through which the
crisis was understood needed to be revolutionized. Keynes and his
colleagues accomplished that task. But by the mid-1970s, it became clear
that the Keynesian policy tools were no longer working at least in the
way they were being applied and it was in this context that monetarism,
supply-side theory and the (beautiful) mathematical modelling of
micro-economic market behaviors supplanted broad-brush macro-economic
Keynesian thinking. The monetarist and narrower neoliberal theoretical
frame that dominated after 1980 is now in question. In fact it has
disastrously failed. We need new mental conceptions to understand the
world. What might these be and who will produce them, given both the
sociological and intellectual malaise that hangs over knowledge
production and (equally important) dissemination more generally? The
deeply entrenched mental conceptions associated with neoliberal theories
and the neoliberalization and corporatization of the universities and
the media has played more than a trivial role in the production of the
present crisis. For example, the whole question of what to do about the
financial system, the banking sector, the state-finance nexus and the
power of private property rights, cannot be broached without going
outside of the box of conventional thinking**[. For this to happen will
require a revolution in thinking, in places as diverse as the
universities, the media and government as well as within the financial
institutions themselves. Karl Marx, while not in any way inclined to
embrace philosophical idealism, held that ideas are a material force in
history. Mental conceptions constitute, after all, one of the seven
moments in his general theory of co-revolutionary change.]{.underline}**

### Pedagogy Alt

#### Critical Pedagogy Is key -- the alternative calls for solidarity through grass roots political movements that mobilize spaces of education microcosms of a broader struggle against capitalism. 

**McLaren & Jaramillo 07 **(McLaren, Peter + Jaramillo,
Nathalia; Distinguished Professor in Critical Studies, College of
Educational Studies, Chapman University, where he is Co-Director of the
Paulo Freire Democratic Project and International Ambassador for Global
Ethics and Social Justice + Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies at
Kennesaw State University, with a focus on Gender and Women\'s Studies;
2007; "Pedagogy and Praxis in the Age of Empire: Toward a new Humanism";
<https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Kahn3/publication/240595905_Review_Symposium_Pedagogy_and_Praxis_in_the_Age_of_Empire_Toward_a_new_Humanism_by_Peter_McLaren_and_Nathalia_Jaramillo_AW_Rotterdam_The_Netherlands_Sense_Publishers_2007_Pp_206_ISBN_978-90-77874-84-4/links/0deec51e771fbe221d000000.pdf>)

[PPAE is a book of pedagogical theory (and in the spirit of
revolutionary critical pedagogy, performative acts of polemic should be
included within the field of theory proper), but as McLaren and
Jaramillo put it, this book's work is not intended "as grist for
advancing our careers in the academy but as a way of participating in a
wider political project in which we attempt (to echo Henry Giroux) to
make the pedagogical more politically informed and the political more
pedagogically critical" (p. 6). ]{.underline}Thus, McLaren and
Jaramillo's collaborations, though often conceptually and linguistically
dense, are not to be mistaken as yet another speculatory exercise in
pedagogical pontification about the problems of schools or how to
reconstruct them so as to emancipate their democratic potentials. [This
is not a Cartesian mediation on social reconstructionism, but an organic
attempt to **articulate a burgeoning worldwide standpoint theory born of
class warfare and other forms of transnational oppression that produce
the dehumanization of global society**. ]{.underline}Supporting this
claim are a variety of personal photos included as textual bookends
(which chronicle the authors' journeys and meetings with key
figures/groups over the last five years in places such as the Middle
East, Africa, and Latin America) that are emblematic of how McLaren and
Jaramillo have begun to construct a critical revolutionary pedagogy that
both walks its talk and makes its road by walking it. Indeed, the images
in PPAE undoubtedly gesture stylistically to those taken of Guevara
during his travels -- portraits produced to express the themes of unity,
companionship and the vital embodiment of collective struggle, what Ché
and Freire each meant in their respective ideas of a materialized
"revolutionary love" (McLaren, 2000). It should be observed that PPAE's
emblematic cover art, produced by Erin Currier, a mural of stirring
revolutionary portraits of everyday warrior women of color (which serve
as necessary expansions of the legacies that otherwise tend to brandish
names such as Zapata and Villa), similarly helps to evoke the potential
beauty and dignity of the historical struggle from below as refleshed
socialist passions in the face of the transnational imperialist
enterprise. [It is crucial, then, to recognize the extent to which PPAE
attempts to both **theorize and enact a critical revolutionary
pedagogy** that, as Gregory Martin (2005) describes, is "a radical shift
of social priorities...that **seeks to enrich the knowledge base of
grassroots political movements through the development of social
relations** (labour practices) **that encourage critical analysis,
genuine dialogue and problem solving based upon people\'s everyday
knowledge of capitalism."**]{.underline} When most progressive academics
are still engaged in coffee talk over how to better involve the local
community in campus life, McLaren and Jaramillo appear to have leapt
over imperialist barricades in order to speak with and forge a wider
resistance to present-day colonialist domination agendas. [In short,
with PPAE they provide a living example of how a **forged solidarity
between critical educators, political activists in social movements**,
informed workers of the world, and others involved in the growing
struggle against imperial capitalism can be the **fertile ground in
which critical revolutionary pedagogy can become rooted and begin to
sprout**. ]{.underline}By articulating a global working-class
standpoint, McLaren and Jaramillo are essentially tracing the objective
structures of global capitalism that have come to organize geo-political
versions of the modern state as well as the social conditions of local
communities across the planet. Further, by aligning their perspectives
on the margins of global imperialism, their theoretical work provides an
anthropological grounding that allows the authors to gain a variety of
outsider-within critical ideational status on the contradictions of
global capitalism that are at work within the U.S. presently. [PPAE
thusly spends a good amount of energy calling out and identifying these
dehumanizing aspects of the U.S. corporate-state-military-academic
complex which include, according to McLaren and Jaramillo, the
institution of a state of permanent war (p. 35), a rightist fomenting of
anti-immigration and other xenophobic attitudes throughout society (p.
99), the rise of anti-bilingual/multicultural efforts in educational
policy such as NCLB (p. 76), the corporate media and culture industry's
complicity in the erosion of an educated civil society (p. 49), the
blatant classism and racism underlying the Bush administration's
response to hurricane Katrina (p. 8), and the ecological genocide that
is a direct result of predatory capitalist expansion at all costs (p.
17). In opposition PPAE hopes to bear witness to the birth and
maturation of a movement within the field of education that viscerally
realizes "**the need for a new critical humanist pedagogy, an approach
to reading the world and the world that puts the struggle against
capitalism (and the imperialism inherent in it) at the center of the
pedagogical project, a project that is powered by the oxygen of
socialism's universal quest for human freedom and social justice"** (p.
20).]{.underline} Again, McLaren and Jaramillo's mapping of the domestic
contradictions of global capitalism evident here in the U.S. is
importantly not limited by a parochial view of the matter. Rather, the
spirit of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela, the work of critical
educators in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the historical legacy of an ongoing
attempt for an emancipated Cuba animates the collective thrust of the
book's thesis. For McLaren and Jaramillo, such sites are not isolated
instances of a controlled alternative to the capitalist form of life.
They clearly delineate a burgeoning constellation of socialist
resistance that is the movementgenerated possibility of another world
beyond the paltry business-class-as-usual driven political openings for
change in the social and educational structure of the United
States. [Drawing from the energy of the international workers movements,
McLaren and Jaramillo want also to re-organize a worldwide front of
critical, popular educators who will comprise an "educational left" (pp.
34-64) that works in concert with extrainstitutional revolutionary
forces]{.underline}. One task this educational left has is to provide a
map of the neoliberal educational landscape that highlights how the
stranglehold of a corporate media oligarchy continues to distribute
public knowledge through strong ideological filters, how standardized
educational curricula have ossified into the normative goal of education
and how the systematic segregation of people of color in schools all
challenge both leftist educators and society generally with complicated
and urgent problems. Therefore, McLaren and Jaramillo ask: "How can
critical educators reinvigorate the civil societarian left precisely at
a time when we are creating a world where elites are less accountable to
civil society than ever before?" (p. 52). According to the authors the
answer to this question lies largely in the potential for generating
concrete revolutionary critical pedagogy, [which means going beyond
progressive constructivist curricular methods towards developing
socialist sensibilities throughout the institution of public schooling
by conscientizing "teachers, students, families and other cultural
workers" (p. 63).]{.underline}

### Class Consciousness Alt

#### Vote negative to affirm a praxis of class consciousness -- only a historical materialist theory committed to a revolutionary program in service of the world-prolietariat can unite workers against capitalism. Our starting point is key -- there is no revolutionary moment without first a revolutionary theory.

There is clearly a trinity here: sectarianism, opportunism, and genuine
Marxism. 34 In its fight against capitalism and for socialism, Marxism
must fight against sectarianism (and its twin, opportunism). This fight
must be in the form of comradely, polite and respectful debates in an
environment that must discourage aggression in any form, including in
words. And the fight must be in practice: **[Marxists must show that it
is possible to come together to produce and refine ideas that are
necessary for revolution, and to engage in actual struggles. The Marxist
fight against sectarianism is necessary, if the communist movement is to
make progress in this epoch of heightened exploitation, recurrent
economic crisis, rising fascism, ugly imperialism and irreversible
ecological damage]{.underline}**. 35 Sectarianism violates the
principles of dialectics many times over: it fails to acknowledge the
principle of unity/relation and difference (that x is connected to, and
similar to, y, and x and y have differences), the idea that the reality
exists at a more fundamental levels and at the surface levels, demanding
different political responses at different levels, and the thinking that
ideas (e.g. those contained in a program) must be tested in practice
(class struggle). There is indeed an urgent need to avoid a
sectarian-politicist approach that says that only those who support
one's own party/group are correct on this or that issue, and indeed,
that no relevant idea can come from a Marxist group/individual with whom
one politically disagrees**[. As well, whether it is possible to work
with an individual/group should depend on that person/groups' commitment
to the revolutionary program (seizure of state power to abolish private
property and to begin constructing popular control over economy, etc.),
a program that reflects the interests of the world-proletariat, and not
on how this or that small group happens to interpret that program.
Revolution is not a commodity in the production of which there is
competition among revolutionary groups to capture the
market.]{.underline}** Revolutionary groups must, of course, engage in
polemical struggles with one another to clarify principles and to learn
from one another. Polemical struggles by groups are necessary to
demarcate themselves on the basis of their commitment to Marxist theory
in which are rooted their strategies and concrete slogans. **[Yet, the
different groups must be engaged in united action against capitalism and
social oppression and indeed defend each other when under attack from
bourgeois forces and work towards the building of a mass proletarian
party, which is more than the sum of little groups, politically and
geographically separated from one another, and in the process, gradually
build a mass proletarian party to take on the juggernaut of
world-capitalism]{.underline}**. In the light of what has been said
above, it is clear that revolution requires multiple conditions. Keeping
in mind the fact that precision of natural science is not possible in
thinking about politics36, as opposed to political economy, I suggest
that we bear in mind the following minimum conditions for revolution. A
socialist revolution is not an automatic process at all, no matter how
much Marxists and communists want a revolution! Revolution requires not
only subjective conditions but also objective conditions. The main
objective condition is the crisis: this is the situation where the
development of productive forces is fettered by social relations of
production and exchange, a fettering that is expressed as stagnant, or
slow rate of economic growth, which is expressed in the lack of jobs,
low wages, etc. Marx (1859) refers to this objective condition when he
says that 'No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive
forces for which it is sufficient have been developed'. **[He is
pointing here to the historical-materialist conclusion that the
capitalist social order will not come to an end until there is a crisis
of the development of productive forces, a crisis caused by social
relations of capitalist production and exchange.]{.underline}** If a
society is experiencing prosperity, if economic growth is not stagnant
or is not slowing down, and if the masses are living reasonably well,
then objective conditions for development do not exist. So the greater
the level of prosperity, the lower the propensity towards revolution.
**[However, there can be objective conditions for revolution as we have
been seeing, and yet there will be no revolution because subjective
conditions are not present. These include the fact that there must be a
significant number of men and women in proletarian conditions, although
the majority of the people do not have to be in a completely proletarian
class-situation]{.underline}**. 37 The proletariat is the material force
of revolution, and it is also the main subjective raw material
(subjective in the sense of revolutionary subjects, or agents). **[Then
the majority of these people, and indeed, the majority of all those
affected by capitalism, must be conscious of the fact that capitalism is
the cause of their problems and of society's problems (in our time,
these include the ecological catastrophe and tendency towards wars), and
that the capitalist system must be abolished as it cannot be
reformed.]{.underline}** So class consciousness is a crucial ingredient.
**[The development of class consciousness is not an automatic
process]{.underline}**: it is not necessary that low-income, unemployed
people will automatically be revolutionaries, although they may have
sparks of consciousness that comes from their life's experience and they
may be receptive to socialist consciousness more than other classes**[.
Class consciousness requires conscious education as well as action (i.e.
trade union struggles and political struggles). Both education and
struggles require the interventions of several organizational
agencies]{.underline}**. These include trade unions and radical mass
organizations. And, above all, these include political parties of the
working class.38 The action against capitalism by the masses in
different places and sectors has to be coordinated and lessons have to
be learnt from successes and mistakes. In other words, what is necessary
is organized action, not just any form of action. **[The organized
action develops class consciousness; it contributes to the
self-confidence of the masses in mounting a fundamental challenge to the
system.]{.underline}** The larger the mass of the proletariat, the
greater the level of class consciousness and the greater the level of
organized action (and all these combine with one another, however,
unevenly, and feed into one another), the greater will be the propensity
towards revolution. And, the propensity towards revolution, as mentioned
above, will be reduced if there is greater prosperity. This idea can be
summarized by the following formula representing what can be called the
Tendency for the Propensity towards Revolution (TPR).

### Party Art

#### Vote Negative to affirm the party -- the enduring political form of communism is necessary to harness a revolutionary mass movement that can not only gain state power but engage in direct act of resistance like break into police arsenals, liberate prisoners through violent protests. Power is formed in collectivity -- the history of communist resistance demonstrates that solidarity is a pre-requisite to producing social transformation. 

**Dean '18** (Jodi Dean is an American political theorist and professor
in the Political Science department at Hobart and William Smith
Colleges; "The Subject of the Revolution";
http://crisiscritique.org/2017/november/Jodi%20Dean.pdf)

**[Who makes the revolution]{.underline}**? Party, class, people? The
one hundredth anniversary of the Russian 1917 Revolution offers an
opportunity to consider again this perennial Marxist question. **[For
some, the question "who makes" is already poorly posed. Processes occur.
Dynamics unfold. Crises develop. Revolutions have their own logics and
to approach them as if they were the planned and deliberate effects of
decisions of conscious agents is to begin with a category
mistake.]{.underline}** But the question of the subject of revolution is
not reducible to an account of conscious agency. So much was already
clear to Georg Lukács in 1924. **[In Lenin: The Unity of His Thought,
Lukács affirms a paradox of revolutionary causality: the party is "both
producer and product, both precondition and result of the revolutionary
mass movement."1 Revolution shapes its makers]{.underline}**. The
subject that makes the revolution doesn't preexist it; the subject is an
effect of revolution. **[Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek further dispel
the fiction of an agential subject of politics. Badiou presents the
subject as a response to a truth-event. Žižek argues that the subject is
a gap, failure, or void.]{.underline}** Badiou gives us the convert,
disciple, militant, or adept. Žižek gives us the Cogito. With respect to
the subject of politics, more specifically, to the subject of
revolution, are these accounts compatible? Is the subject of a truth the
subject as a gap? When the people are the subject of politics, the
answer is yes. In the Marxist tradition, the people are divided and
disruptive, present retroactively in the insistence of crowds of women,
workers, soldiers, and peasants. **[Never the unity of the nation or the
fullness of reconciled society, the people are the subject to which the
revolution attests. Lukács invokes the people in just this sense when he
explains the dialectical transformation of the concept of the people in
Lenin's characterization of the Russian Revolution: "The vague and
abstract concept of 'the people' had to be rejected, but only so that a
revolutionary, discriminating, concept of 'the people'---the
revolutionary alliance of the oppressed---could develop from a concrete
understanding of the conditions of proletarian
revolution."]{.underline}**2 China Miéville's story of the Russian
Revolution brings this idea to life. Miéville gives us a revolution
forcing through what might impede, delay, or derail it. It's a
"messianic interruption" that "emerges from the quotidian." It's
unsayable, "yet the culmination of everyday exhortations."3 **[Exceeding
any party or class that might contain it, the revolution manifests the
people as the collective subject of politics. Revolution shapes its
makers through the effects that attest to the force of the divided
people.]{.underline}** The people make the revolution that makes the
people. **[October Miéville's October presents the actuality of
revolution as an accelerating accumulation of effects: the force of the
many where they don't belong, the breakdown of order, custom, and
provisioning, and the exhilarating push of the unexpected overwhelm as
society becomes nature.]{.underline}** Groups and agents struggle to
steer events -- or at least avoid being crushed by them. Some succeed,
as often despite as because of their best efforts: "the revolutionaries
made slapstick errors."4 **[Neither the best theory nor best practices
determine outcomes, although patient, thorough organizing helps push
them in one direction rather than another.]{.underline}** And even as
the primary force seems to belong to contingency \-- "insurgency has
strange triggers" \-- the open sequence of emancipatory politics
nevertheless admits of another power, that of the revolutionary people.5
The event of revolution is the struggle over and through them, their
struggle. **[Three aspects of Miéville's story stand out in this regard
-- crowds, infrastructure, and division. Miéville never ceases to bring
out the power of masses in the streets. Number matters. At the beginning
of 1917, over 400,000 workers lived in Petrograd. 160,000 soldiers were
stationed in the city. On January 9th, 150,000 workers went on strike.
30,000 struck in Moscow.]{.underline}** **[By February 14, 100,000 were
still striking. On the 22nd, the bosses at the Putilov factory locked
out 30,000 workers. The next day was International Women's Day. Radicals
organized speeches, meetings, and celebrations linking the war, the
sky-rocketing cost of living, and the situation of women. "But even they
did not expect what happened next."6 Women poured out of the factories
and marched through Petrograd's most militant districts, "filling the
side streets in huge and growing numbers."7 Men came on and joined them.
They shouted not just for bread, but for an end to the war and an end to
the monarchy. "Without anyone having planned it, almost 90,000 women and
men were roaring on the streets of Petrograd."8 The next day, 240,000
people were on strike. Number continued to matter throughout the spring
and summer. 400,000 people on the streets of Petrograd in June. 50,000
deserters from the front crowding into the city.]{.underline}** Half a
million demonstrating on July 4th. Although a matter of number, the
crowd's force exceeds it, always giving rise to the affective
intensities propelling revolution. **[The hungry many lining up for
bread at understocked bakeries are "crucibles for dissent."9 Crowds
launch, unleash, smash, and ransack. They block and overwhelm. They
break into police arsenals, take the weapons, and kill the police.
Crowds storm prisons, tear open doors, and free inmates.]{.underline}**
They surge and flock, storm and rout. Crowds are jubilant, enraged,
militant, trusting, furious, incandescent, delighted, demanding,
disgusted. They fill space and can't be held back. They insist, clamor,
and stampede. Crowds manifest as peasants seizing land, soldiers' mass
defections, workers transformed into an armed militia. As the September
backlash sets in, crowds also present as catastrophe: "starving
proletarian communities raged from house to house in bands, hunting for
both food speculators and food."10 **[Crowds bring fire and fury, the
"smell of smoke and the howling of apes," "apocalyptic
nihilo-drunkenness."]{.underline}**11 Metaphor and metonymy, crowds are
the street's growling anger and the city's radical energy. Miéville
attends to the materialities of revolution. **[Yes, the level of the
development of Russia's productive forces -- as with most accounts of
the 1917 revolution, the country's weak bourgeoisie and economic
backwardness do not go unmentioned \-- but also revolution's diverse
infrastructures: trains, railways, tramcars, telephone lines, banners,
presses, and bridges; smashed glass, ricocheting bullets, and bursts of
electricity]{.underline}**. **[Media plays a role; of course the party
papers, but also the telegraph: "with the news of the revolution spread
the revolution itself."]{.underline}**12 Some weapons are "too filthy to
fire."13 Others lack ammunition. A plan calls for a specific signal: a
red lantern raised on a flagpole. It turns out that no one has a red
lantern and once a substitute lantern is found it's nearly impossible to
get it up the flagpole. The signal comes ten hours late. **[Contingency
accompanies the material infrastructure of revolution as much as it does
its crowds.]{.underline}** Political forms are also components of the
revolution's infrastructure. In 1917 Russia, the most famous of the
political forms is the soviet. It evokes a classic Russian peasant mode
of association. It repeats 1905's revolutionary reinvigoration of this
form. **[And in February 1917, it arises from the streets. "Activists
and streetcorner agitators" call for the return of the soviets "in
leaflets, in boisterous voices from the crowds."]{.underline}**14 Signal
and form of people's power, soviets spread virally throughout the
country. The soviet form expresses as well 1917's tense stand-off and
accommodation between the revolution and reform, the Soviet of Workers
and Soldiers Deputies in its relation of dual power with the Duma.
Perhaps the most notorious of the revolution's infrastructure of
political forms, at least in the eyes of some contemporary leftists, is
the party. **[But while too many today present the party as a military
machine with iron-discipline, a centralized apparatus capable of taking
hold of the entire society in a revolutionary situation, Miéville gives
us a slew of revolutionary parties, sometimes cooperating, often
fighting, trying to navigate a rapidly changing
situation.]{.underline}** The Bolsheviks are not even Lenin's Bolsheviks
but rather their own contradictory mix of discipline and disobedience
held together by ideological debate in a political form responding to
revolutionary conditions. In March, Lenin is still in Zurich. Bolsheviks
are divided with respect to opposition to the Provisional Government.
The Petrograd Committee passes a "semi Menshevik" revolution. Returning,
Lenin excoriates his comrades for even their limited support of the
Provisional Government. He rages at the Bolsheviks' lack of discipline.
He advocates moving to the revolution's second phase: no collaboration
with the bourgeoisie; power in the hands of the proletariat and poorest
peasants. Bolshevik support isn't automatic. **[Lenin has to work for
it. He doesn't always win and even when he does the Bolsheviks are often
small presences in the various soviets in which they participate. In the
difficult and confused July days, the party lags behind increasingly
militant workers and soldiers. Stalin drafts a vague pamphlet that
"pretended to a unity of purpose and analysis, an influence, that the
party did not possess.]{.underline}**"15 In September, Lenin is in an
utterly antagonistic relation to his own party. Isolated in his
convictions, his writing censored, he not only disobeys a direct
instruction of the Central Committee, but also tenders his resignation
from it. Like the break-up that doesn't take, the resignation doesn't
happen. The party remains divided. **[Soviet and party are but two of
the political forms providing an infrastructure for
revolution]{.underline}**. Additional forms include other modes of
political association -- congresses, conferences, and committees.
**[They include the police and the military and their different
organizations, some reactionary, some radical. There were the Women's
Battalions of Death, set up by the Kerensky government, as well as armed
Cossacks who refused to ride against the people]{.underline}**. **[The
archive of tactics and when to deploy them is also a component of
revolution's infrastructure: demands, "patient explanation," compromise,
slogans.]{.underline}** **[In this vein, theory is itself part of the
infrastructure of revolution, one of the ways participants make sense of
what is going on and what is to be done]{.underline}**. Miéville brings
outs theory's indeterminacy, the ways it directs its adherents in
opposing directions. Exemplary is the understanding of Marxism as
designating a particular timeline for revolution: proletarian revolution
comes after bourgeois revolution. **[Their theory told supporters of the
Soviet in the early days of dual power that their role was to put brakes
on the revolution: "here was the hesitancy of those whose socialism
taught that a strategic alliance with the bourgeoisie was necessary,
that, however messily events proceeded, there were stages yet to come,
that it was the bourgeoisie who must first take
power]{.underline}**."**[16 With revolution's crowds and infrastructures
comes division. Division concentrates, intensifies, and propels the
revolution]{.underline}**. Such concentration, intensification, and
propulsion expose what appear from one perspective as impediments to the
revolutionary power of the people to be its demonstration. **[Multiple
divisions consolidate into binaries: Soviet v. Duma, other governmental
apparatuses cease to matter; for or against the war, subtle distinctions
fall by the wayside; people v. bourgeoisie, the proletariat's and
peasantry's different interests eclipsed by their common opposition to a
government unwilling to end the war; revolution and counter-revolution
as reactionary forces fight back.]{.underline}** There is even a
concentration of the division between the politicized and the
disengaged. Miéville notes a dramatic decrease in voting between May and
September and accompanying increase in the militancy of the votes cast;
the center cannot hold. Each concentration of social and political
division intensifies the political moment: dual power strengthens the
workers and soldiers represented in the Soviet and weakens the
capacities of the Provisional Government; **[mass desertion amplifies
losses at the front and violence and shortages in the cities; the
economic crisis is inscribed in blood on the backs of the poor;
Bolsheviks are arrested, vigilantes roam the streets, and across the
country arise ultraright anti-Semitic pogromists]{.underline}**. In
July, "everywhere was confrontation, sometimes in sordid form."17
Concentration and intensification of division push the revolution
forward. **[This push is the revolution, not the crowds and the
infrastructure alone but the dynamics that conjoin, energize, and direct
them. A party gives instructions. The crowd ignores them. Parties call
for unity, but fail to find a way to unify. Plans fail. Crowds surprise
everyone with a sea of red banners. Counter-revolutionaries smash
opponents. Revolution pushes forward despite countless impediments,
myriad attempts to calm and contain it.]{.underline}** The people are
the gap between expectation and result, the divisive force that exceeds
available channels. The overcoming of impediments, the challenge they
present and the response they engender, drives the revolution. Events
ignore the hesitation of those socialists convinced that the time is not
ripe for proletarian revolution. **[Their historical anxiety, no matter
how well-grounded in Marxist theory, responds to and is met by the force
of the revolutionary people -- crowds, deserters, rioters, and even
counterrevolutionaries]{.underline}**. The real of revolution breaks
through whether they want it or not. Soviets across the country,
Bolsheviks across the soviets, give the revolution a form by providing
sites that can see themselves as the people. Crowds generate their
affective supplement. Even the divisions between and among the
socialists \-- Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Lenin and his own party --
function as enabling impediments through which to discern the people as
the subject of revolution**[. As divisions are concentrated and
intensified, decisions are made. Which one is correct is determined in
the streets, in the course of its interaction with the multiplicity of
changing circumstances]{.underline}**. Intensification makes some ideas,
some tactics and slogans, better at some points and worse at others.
**[The efficacy of tactics and slogans points to the people as their
cause, and not to the parties or factions that introduce them. Lenin has
to appeal to peasants as well as workers because that's who the people
are.]{.underline}** October gives us October as the event of revolution.
The event accumulates through conflicting combinations of crowds,
infrastructures, and division. **[The force of the people exceeds the
theories, associations, and measures pronounced sometimes in their name,
sometimes to control or contain them.18 From the one side, their
revolutionary force appears regardless of whether it is wanted,
predicted, or authorized.]{.underline}** Its effects manifest with the
breaking through or overcoming of each impediment. **[From the other, it
is the attempts to understand, mobilize, channel, and win the support of
the divided people that present the revolution to itself. The fact of
this presentation, the necessity of mediation, propels the revolution
whether the presentation is right or wrong, accurate or not. The
struggle over the presentation of the revolution doubles and inflects
the revolution itself.]{.underline}** The people as revolution's subject
is an effect of the impediments they can be said to have overcome in
their assertion of their power. Neither audience to action on a
political stage, inert mass set in motion by energizing parties, nor
victims to processes outside their control, the people are present in
the accumulated effects of upheaval that testify to the divided people
as their subject.

### Post-Structuralist Anarchism Alt

#### The alternative is post-structuralist anarchism. We reject representational politics in favor of autonomous spaces of anti-capitalist exchange and existence -- forming life outside of the system of capital is necessary given the impending collapse of capitalism. 

**Morland '18** (Dave Morland is a political philosopher and author of
"Demanding the Impossible"; "Anti-Capitalism and Poststructuralist
Anarchism: Changing Anarchism";
https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/view/9781526137289/9781526137289.00008.xml)

In essence, then, there are two features of new social movements that
may be classified as anarchist in nature. **[The first, what Welsh
refers to as 'autonomous capacity building', is that which links the old
with the new: the rejection of representation]{.underline}**. Anarchists
have always been suspicious of vanguardism. Whether it appears in the
form of a revolutionary élite or the veiled vampirism of an organisation
that thinks it knows better, representation has been and remains an
unwelcome reference in the anarchist lexicon of resistance. **[The
reluctance of new social movements to be drawn into hackneyed strategies
of political protest signals an invigorating commitment towards
anarchism in action]{.underline}**. It is precisely this ethos that
underlines what Graeber (2002: 66) refers to as the movement's quest 'to
map out a completely new territory'. **[Groups like the Direct Action
Network and Tute Bianche are striving to construct 'a 'new language' of
civil disobedience, combining elements of street theatre, festival and
what can only be called non-violent warfare']{.underline}** (Graeber,
2002: 66). Such activities contrast sharply with traditional forms of
protest associated with the social democratic Left and trades union
politics over the last forty years. If nothing else, these protests have
a very different feel about them. When compared to the prearranged march
and rally, more recent protests certainly induce a sense of organic
autonomy within their participants. **[Nonetheless, these tactics
converge with the anarchist culture of 'delegitimizing and dismantling
mechanisms of rule while winning ever-larger spaces of autonomy from'
the State]{.underline}** (Graeber, 2002: 68). New forms of protest The
second feature is that which delineates contemporary social movements as
converging with poststructuralist anarchism. As Goaman and Dodson (1997)
rightly point out, if new social movements remain locked into tired
modes of political protest, they will fail to transcend the parameters
of orthodox socialist politics. **[By its very nature, anarchism has
sought out alternative modes of opposition. Establishing communes,
building free schools, publishing radical tracts, writing
anti-hierarchical lyrics, planting flowers, living in trees, growing
organic food, squatting in unused properties, and recycling cooking oil
into green diesel are evidence of how resistance within anarchist
circles assumes symbolic and cultural forms.]{.underline}** It is also
demonstrative of how both social anarchism and poststructuralism
converge and are mediated by resistance**[. As May (1994) has argued, it
is precisely through the promotion and cherishing of alternative
practices that poststructuralism and social anarchism come
together.]{.underline}** In doing so they form a backdrop in front of
which the new social movements surrounding the anti-capitalist debate
play out modes of socio-cultural resistance.6 This socio-cultural
movement amounts to more than a just penchant for carnival-style
resistance. **[In the wake of communism's downfall across the former
Soviet bloc and the general retreat of the Left when faced with a
virulent neoliberalism, opposition to capitalism has transformed itself
from endeavours to construct a brave new world (for much of the time
premised on a centrally planned economy) to local and internal
resistance.]{.underline}** As Sader (2002: 97) comments, resistance in
this changed environment has become separated from historical
metanarratives and crude economism and has transformed itself into the
'local and sectoral'. Even if we cannot agree a name for it, society is
certainly in transition and social movements reflect this change.
**[This is not to say that traditional social movements have suddenly
vanished. To be sure there is overlap between the old and the new in
contemporary anti-capitalist protest, but there is also a real sense in
which new social movements are distinct from their
predecessors.]{.underline}** As **[Melucci has observed, there are a
number of common factors one may identify here: the diversity and low
negotiability of the movement's goals; eschewing political power;
questioning the partition between public and private; the convergence of
protest and deviance; reaching for solidarity through action; and the
repudiation of representation in favour of direct action.]{.underline}**
(Melucci, 1996: 102--3) Echoing social anarchist sentiments through
their own contemporary praxis, new social movements are also deeply
reflective of new modes of anarchism. In **[targeting nodes of power
across social, cultural and political networks, by way of organising
into non-hierarchical and decentralised networks themselves, the
anti-capitalist movement not only reinforces the customary anarchist
approach to resistance but also confirms 'what is to be resisted' (May,
1994: 52). Here, we witness the emergence of poststructuralist
anarchism.]{.underline}** **[Subjects and structures obtain meaning
through the specific practices from which they arise. In spurning
representation, in shunning the quest for political power, and in
focusing on the present and the specific (Melucci, 1996: 116), the
anti-capitalist movement encompasses a series of attempts to carve out
social spaces of autonomy that, by their very nature, oppose the
dominant paradigm of neoliberal economic and social
commodification.]{.underline}** This search for auonomous zones unfolds
itself at the level of the local and the specific intersections of
social, cultural, economic and political networks. Essentially, the
anti-capitalist movement has embarked on a poststructuralist voyage to
'construct power relationships that can be lived with' (May, 1994: 114).
Recognition that power pervades multiple networks is recognition that
power can never be eliminated. Social anarchists have long realised
that. In building alternative practices, poststructuralist anarchists
are engaged in what Deleuze and Guattari (1988: 291) term 'becoming
minoritarian'. **[By developing alternative practices through social
forums and other networks and organisations, contemporary anarchists are
challenging dominant practices and simultaneously escaping
oppression]{.underline}**. As Deleuze and Guattari contend in A thousand
plateaux, the concept of majority 'assumes a state of power and
domination, not the other way around. It assumes the standard means, not
the other way around.' With that in mind, it is important to distinguish
between 'the majoritarian as a constant and homogenous system;
minorities as subsystems; and the minoritarian as a potential, creative
and created, becoming' (1988: 105--6). In becoming minor, 'a
nondenumerable and proliferating minority . . . threatens to destroy the
very concept of majority' (1988: 469).

### Revolutionary Terror Alt

#### Reject their appeals to moralism -- the revolution must reclaim violence to challenge the sovereignty of the state. 

**Bell '77** (J. Bowyer Bell was considered an expert on terrorism and
authored "The Secret Army" "Trends on Terror: The Analysis of Political
Violence"; World Politics 29(03); 477-479;
<http://sci-hub.se/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/trends-on-terror-the-analysis-of-political-violence/943BDB3DDDDDB2ABB6C5E22EBF817E89>)

Part of the difficulty, other than the elusive nature of the subject,
has been that while terrorism was a conventional revolutionary term in
the 19th century, the word is now a label used by the threatened to
damage their opponents. \"**[Terrorism\" thus has become a convenient
means to identify evil threats rather than to define a special kind of
revolutionary violence evolving out of Russian radicalism and European
anarchism. Today revolutionaries want to be guerrillas, not terrorists.
And the enemies of revolution, often of change, have evaded the problems
of counterterror, denied the rationality of the new revolutionaries, and
sought to create for this decade an archetype enemy much like the
anarchist bomber of an earlier time.]{.underline}** Consequently,
terrorism has come to have many meanings. The very word has become a
touchstone for postures and beliefs about the nature of man and society,
and the relation of law, order, and justice. Clearly, some of these
violent deeds are simple criminal acts, and others are the result of the
compulsive fantasies of the mad. Obviously some governments have
instigated a campaign of counterterror or permitted vigilantes to do so.
**[Almost always, however, it is the use of spectacular violence by
revolutionaries that has attracted the most attention and caused the
deepest concern. There are conventional ways to deal with criminals and
lunatics, long a recognized threat to society; and somehow a
\"licensed\" assassin is less threatening than a revolutionary
gunman]{.underline}**. In the case of revolutionary violence, three
major points of analytical contention exist: **[What kind of violence
can be labeled terrorism? What kind of men act in this way? And to what
extent are their actions effective?]{.underline}** Answers to the first
query run from any violent threat to existing order to a denial that
\"terrorism\" is anything more than a pejorative label. Responses to the
second query fall into two major categories: first, that such men are
fanatics more properly studied by psychologists than by political
scientists; second, that with a few exceptions, such men are rational
and acting for a specific revolutionary purpose. Finally, assessments of
such violence again produce two poles: first, that such acts are
ineffectual and or counterproductive; second, that such acts at times
have affected events to revolutionary advantage. **[There is, however,
general agreement that in recent years there has been a rise in
revolutionary violence, a spate of new and spectacular tactics, and a
growing threat to transnational order. Again, there are a variety of
explanations for such a trend toward terrorism.]{.underline}** The end
of imperialism has reduced the number of overt targets. **[The rise of
interdependence has produced an increasingly homogenized Western culture
that appears to threaten the future of inchoate nationalities---the
Basque language will be lost and the youth move to Madrid. And the
consumer society has alienated radicals who see color television as the
opiate of the people]{.underline}**. **[In an era of easing major power
confrontations, the prospect of serious changes in the international
system has thwarted the ambitions of others who want adjustments---who
want to create new nations (Eritrea), to unite divided ones (Ireland),
to change boundaries (Somalia), or to displace minority regimes
(Rhodesia).]{.underline}** **[Thus, there are a great many ambitions and
aspirations held by those with little leverage, which under present
circumstances cannot be achieved and yet cannot be abandoned by the
faithful.]{.underline}** **[Most such revolutionaries would prefer to
wage a limited war or to undertake a guerrilla campaign---now nearly a
conventional form of war---but they lack the means]{.underline}**. At
best, they can bring the campaign into the cities where guerrilla
tactics can more readily be seen as resort to terrorism than can a
struggle in the far bush. At worst, they have to resort solely to
spectacular acts of violence---not the tactics of the armed struggle,
but a strategy of terror. Thus no one but the Portuguese labeled FRELIMO
in Mozambique as terrorists. **[Most urban guerrillas ---the Tupamaros
or the I.R.A.---become \"terrorists\" to those other than the threatened
government when the previously immune and innocent---diplomats,
businessmen, or tourists---become targets, and when bombs are set
without warning. Some organizations---Black September or the Red
Army---must resort to such violence from the very beginning in order to
maintain the organization and to achieve prominence.]{.underline}** In
its own analysis, Black September felt that its operation at the Munich
Olympics was a success. **[The Fedayeen sought not public sympathy but
to impart a simple lesson to the world: if we are unhappy, so shall you
be; if there is no justice for us, there shall be no peace for you. When
the question was asked in horror why men do these dreadful things, there
were those ready to explain the despair and desperation of the
Palestinians.]{.underline}**

### Palestinian Self-determination Alt

#### The alternative is a Marxist call for Palestinian self --determination, reorienting our strategies towards Israel and bds is key -- our praxis must challenge the way elites across national divides deny the possibilities of revolution and commit to arming revolutionaries, strikes and uprisings are. Rejected the totalizing boycotts of the aff in favor of targeted works boycotts.

**Al-Jaza\'iri and Grant 2010 (**Isa and Alex, writes at in defense of
Marxism, "Against the blanket boycott of Israel - for a working class
solution",
<https://www.marxist.com/against-blanket-boycott-israel-working-class-solution.htm>**)**

The Palestinian movement has gone through the entire spectrum of
tactics---from guerrilla war, to plane hijackings, kidnappings,
terrorism, bourgeois compromises, and now, boycott. Throughout the past
decades, while the Palestinian leadership abroad was already moving
towards some kind of deal with the state of Israel, something was
developing beneath the surface in Palestinian society. **[The first
Intifada burst forth in 1987. The revolution did not wait for the
Palestinian leaders; it came despite their failures, and did its work
without them. The Palestinian masses threw up councils of revolutionary
action to organize their struggle throughout the occupied territories,
and even in Palestinian-Israeli neighbourhoods]{.underline}**.
Spontaneously, and with a leadership thrown up on the ground within the
neighbourhoods and with sheer determination and spirit drove the
movement forward. The councils mushroomed, the expression of the
collective activity of downtrodden masses flooding onto the stage of
history for the very first time. **[In contrast to the corrupt methods
and stale tactics of the isolated groups that had, until then, dominated
political activity, the movement was truly democratic and put forward
concrete demands. Some councils organized mass boycotts of Israeli
taxes, which were collected by the army. General strikes arose and
barricades were constructed. This was a political earthquake, and
achieved what all the tactics of the established Palestinian leaders
could not achieve in decades: fear gripped the Israeli ruling class. The
repression and intensified house demolitions were only spurring the
movement on.]{.underline}** The exploited Israeli working class watched
its sons sent to the front lines to kill fearless stone-throwing
children; the capitalists rightfully feared the effect this would have
on their consciousness. The Israeli capitalists' worst fears were that
Israeli workers would make the connection between cuts to their wages
and services, and to the attacks on the Palestinian masses. A general
strike in Israel, in solidarity with the Palestinian masses and their
popular insurrection, would have spelled the beginning of the end of
Israeli capitalism. However, the Israeli workers' leaders were tied to
the Israeli bosses and worked with them to sell out the struggles of the
workers. They did everything possible to support the Israeli regime in
its hour of need. US imperialism led the efforts to negotiate a
compromise that could offer a more secure order in the territories. The
Israeli imperialists found willing servants in the nascent Palestinian
bourgeoisie. In effect, a privileged Palestinian elite was given the
task of policing the Palestinian masses, and profited from the
occupation. Palestinians worked for Israeli companies, crossing into
Israel and returning home at night, but also worked for other
Palestinians who built bottling plants and booming capitalist
operations. The Palestinian petty-bourgeois leadership developed into a
bourgeoisie and got comfortable and corrupt. Fatah evolved from an
organization that at least talked of socialism and revolution into the
party of the capitalists and super rich in the occupied territories.
**[The BDS campaign claims a rejection of violence, but that is not the
point. The self-defence of the Palestinian people is justified and
necessary; if anything, the Intifada taught the neighbourhood councils
that they needed arms to defend the revolution, prevent the massacres,
and inflict defeats on the Israeli army when it enters Palestinian
territory.]{.underline}** But this revolution had nothing in common with
the tactics of suicide attacks, or firing rockets on Israeli working
class neighborhoods. Such desperate actions are no threat to the Israeli
state; they only terrorize the Israeli workers. The first suicide attack
in Palestinian history came on 16th April 1993, and can be viewed as a
result of desperation due to the failure of the revolution and the onset
of reaction in Palestinian society. This revolution also heightened the
yearning for a solution by the Israeli workers and brought them closer
to the Palestinian masses, unlike the rockets and bombings, which have
had the opposite effect. For a working class approach **[The working
class has proven, time and again, its power when united. Only organized
working class action will help liberate the Palestinian masses, not
vague consumer boycotts. The Palestinian masses have shown amazing
heroism, enough to put through a dozen revolutions, but the reality is
that only one force can overthrow Israeli imperialism---the Jewish and
Arab Israeli working class.]{.underline}** Without their work, not a
single gear moves in the factories of Israel. **[Israeli imperialism is
built on the myth that the Israeli worker and boss share a common
interest and should stand together for mutual defence. Our task is to
explode this myth, and our tactics must take this into
account.]{.underline}** Something must be done, on this we agree. What
kind of tactics would a working class campaign undertake? **[There is
only one kind of boycott that was effective during the South African
struggle: the targeted union boycott. Workers\' unions on the docks
refused to load any arms shipments destined for South Africa. This is a
very clear method that relies not on petitioning corporations, or
appeals to the tricksters in the UN or in parliament, but on immediate
and vigorous implementation by the working class. Activists should
launch a campaign, based on union affiliation, where armaments workers,
transport workers, and postal workers refuse to fill weapons orders
meant for Israeli imperialism.]{.underline}** The Canadian Union of
Postal Workers has signed on to BDS. **[Instead of calling on its
workers to boycott Israeli goods, the union should call on its members
to refuse to deliver any mail to SNC-Lavalin or similar weapons
companies so long as they build weapons for Israeli capitalism.
Alongside this union campaign, mass demonstrations can be organized
against visiting representatives of Israeli imperialism.]{.underline}**
Current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was given a spectacular
welcome by thousands of protesters when he attempted to speak at
Concordia University in 2003. This is correct; such criminals and
apologists for Zionism should be shut down. **[These kinds of tactics,
which differentiate between the Israeli workers and their ruling class,
are the kinds of working class methods that will help the Israeli and
Palestinian working masses overthrow Israeli imperialism.]{.underline}**
Class unity and the fight for socialism **[There is no force on Earth
other than the Israeli working class that can destroy Israeli
imperialism. Unity between the Israeli proletariat and the Palestinian
toilers and fallaheen (farmers) is the first necessity for carrying out
a revolution that will end the bloodshed once and for
all.]{.underline}** The movement in solidarity must be based on that
unity. We reject the perspective of \"Jews to the sea\". The solution
will not come without working class Israeli Jews; they will play the
central role! This is why we reject the BDS campaign as
counter-productive, and a campaign that strengthens bourgeois Zionism.
We reject any attempt to place blame on the Israeli workers for the
crimes of their ruling class, no less than we reject attempts to blame
the Palestinian masses for the blood spilt by Hamas and Fatah. The blame
rests squarely on the shoulders of the Israeli and Palestinian
bourgeoisies, and the capitalist classes in the US, Canada and the rest
of the western world. This is why **[the workers and youth in the
advanced capitalist countries cannot stop at solidarity. This fight must
be linked to the fight for socialism at home. Our imperialists profit
from these wars, and the only solution is a movement to throw them out
here as well. Capitalism worldwide must be overthrown.]{.underline}**
The Jewish and the Palestinian peoples both have a strong socialist and
revolutionary history. With help from the international workers' and
solidarity movement, they will be able to find the way back to these
traditions and throw nationalism and fundamentalism on both sides to the
trash pile. **[Freed from fratricidal warfare and the meddling of
imperialism, the Palestinian and Israeli working masses would be able to
unite in a voluntary socialist union of both peoples as the first step
towards a Socialist Federation of the Middle East: liberating their
resources and using them for human need instead of for profit, and to
rapidly develop in common and rise out of the collective
misery.]{.underline}** Therefore, we appeal to **[all those who fight
for the liberation of the Palestinian peoples to adopt the following
course of action: 1. Abandon the blanket boycott of Israel, which pushes
the Israeli workers into the arms of the imperialists. 2. Adopt a
workers' boycott that targets the Israeli state and representatives of
the regime. 3. Promote strategies that build solidarity between Jewish
and Arab workers. 4. Fight for socialism, both at home and in the Middle
East.]{.underline}**

#### The alternative is solidarity with the sunflower movement- in resistance to Chinese Integration, Taiwanese activists occupied Parliament for 24 days to demand the review of trade agreements. Affirming the sunflower movement challenges the neoliberal hegemony of the future- refusal to accept the imposition of nationalism and neoliberalism is a pre-requisite to political organization against the structure of capitalism that produce international relations.

**Wang 2017 (**Chih-ming , Academia Sinica - Taiwan, "'The future that
belongs to us': Affective politics, neoliberalism and the Sunflower
Movement," 2017, Sage Publications**)**

Thanks to the tireless news broadcasting and the **[hyper-dynamic social
media that quickly attracted more students and concerned citizens to the
cause and the site of protest, the Parliament turned into a mecca of
activism and a spectacle of political desire, and the movement against
the CSSTA was thus born in the name of Sunflower, echoing the Wild
Lilies and Wild Strawberries movements before it,1 as a sign of hope,
defiance, and courage]{.underline}**. As expected, the government
responded to the protest negatively. **[The police attempted to evict
the students by force, but the students had already used whatever was to
hand to build blockades and assemble their own press center, turning the
occupied Parliament into a combined citadel and a live news
station]{.underline}**. Five days later, in order to press the issue,
**[the more radical students broke through the police who were defending
it and entered into the government's top administration building, the
Administrative Yuan.]{.underline}** **[This spontaneous action instantly
escalated the tension: the police resorted to using water cannon and
batons against the protesters, and arrested several student leaders.
Undaunted, students responded by organizing a mass demonstration on 30
March, bringing about 700,000 people to the streets to press their
demands.]{.underline}** **[The head of the Parliament, Wang Jin-pyng,
known for his political calculation, visited the protesters and promised
that the Parliament would put the review of CSSTA on hold until the
Parliament first legislated the rules to govern cross-Strait
negotiations]{.underline}**. At 6 p.m. on 10 April, each with a
sunflower in their hands, **[the protesters declared victory and left
the Parliament, bringing to an end 24 days of occupation. The Sunflower
Movement has commanded global media attention and provoked analysts and
scholars to ponder why it happened, how to understand its contexts and
creative expressions, and what impacts it might have on democratic
practices, political theory, and cross-Strait relations]{.underline}**.3
While some scholars defended the Sunflower Movement through the
discourse of civil disobedience, **[legitimizing its liberatory politics
and nationalist concerns]{.underline}** (Chen CM, 2014, 2015; Ho, 2015;
Jones and Su, 2015; Ye, 2014), others found the movement's
pro-independence, anti-China, and masculinist stances troubling, and its
uncritical attitude toward free trade worrying (Hong 2014; Hu 2014; Wang
and Hu 2014). Bowen Tseng (2014) observes that the movement contains
four different and contradictory elements: anti-China Taiwanese
nationalism; leftist anti-free trade sentiment; demands for democratic
reforms; and generational justice. **[While these elements are mutually
interpenetrated and uneasily aligned within the protest against the
CSSTA, the last element, I submit, is especially noteworthy: not only
because students were the main force behind this movement but also
because their participation in the events was actually inspired by the
feeling of deprivation at a time when unemployment and real estate
prices are on the rise, wage levels in decline, and upward mobility
through education and hard work diminished.]{.underline}** Tseng (2014)
explains that **[Sunflower students belong to the 'collapsing
generation' (bong shidai) that is confronted by economic crises,
political impasse, class polarization, fertility decline, and falling
wages]{.underline}**.4 'Their discontents engendered calls for
"generational justice" and the yearning for a "youthful subjectivity",'
Tseng argues, '**[this is why the Sunflower Movement could mobilize
students to join the protest so fast,' because 'whether or not they
understand what the issue is, by participation, they already obtained a
subjective feeling that "our future is in our hands"']{.underline}**
(2014: 140--1). **[This observation is important because it captures
well a 'structure of feeling' that understands the Sunflower Movement
less as an ideological struggle between unification and independence,
free market and protectionism, and right and left, and more as an
affective response to the uncertainties of the future released by
neoliberalism. It also shows how neoliberalism in Taiwan is being
understood not only in terms of political economy but also as a factor
contributing to social inequality, precarity of life and work, and class
reproduction, increasingly entrenched and enlarged by the crossStraits
trade]{.underline}** (Lin 2016a, 2016b). Taking its cue from Tseng's
observation, this article seeks to reconsider the discourse of the
future in the Sunflower Movement. **[The 'future' is important not only
because Taiwan has a peculiar 'national' status as hinged on the wind of
the future, but also because the vision of the future is embedded in
neoliberalism as a structure of feeling, or rather as an existential
imperative that compels one to 'invest' in oneself, to compete
relentlessly so as to arrive at a future of prosperity.]{.underline}**
Jason Read argues that **[neoliberalism produces a subject -- homo
economicus -- who embodies a new mode of 'governmentality' that operates
not in the terms of law or rights, but in those of 'interest, investment
and competition' for the purpose of capitalist
accumulation]{.underline}** (2009: 29). **[Neoliberalism is neither just
a political economy, nor an array of capital-friendly policies executed
by the state, but, as David Harvey argues, a 'conceptual apparatus ...
that appeals to our intuitions and instincts, to our values and our
desires, as well as to the possibilities inherent in the social world we
inhabit'; and its concepts of dignity and individual freedom, so
powerful and appealing, have become the 'central values of civilization'
(Harvey, 2005a: 5). Noting that 'neoliberal governmentality results from
the infiltration of market-driven truths and calculations into the
domain of politics,']{.underline}** Aihwa Ong also points out that
**[individuals under neoliberalism are 'induced to selfmanage according
to market principles of disciplines, efficiency, and
competitiveness']{.underline}** (2006: 4). In this sense,
**[neoliberalism is also an existential imperative that hails us into
being, to seek freedom and dignity, not as inalienable rights but rather
as the quest of life. Because neoliberal competition mobilizes constant
optimization of one's skills and resources to avoid falling into the
realm of devaluation and abandonment]{.underline}** (Ong, 2006: 6),
**[the future is uncertain, precarious, and even elusive. It is
something one can look forward to but never hold on to with any degree
of certainty, even though what the future will look like has never been
clearer.]{.underline}** This article attempts to **[address
neoliberalism's future by conceptualizing the Sunflower Movement as an
affective-political explosion of discontents -- not only against
Taiwan's political status quo, but also against the uncertain future
that the status quo holds for them]{.underline}**. By
'**[affective-political,' I gesture toward an understanding of both the
affective dimension of politics as well as the political meaning of
affect,]{.underline}** as articulated by the 'affective turn' in recent
cultural studies scholarship that considers **[affect as 'the
imbrication of the social and the somatic' to capture 'bodies politics'
-- both embodied and embedded -- 'in the production, bypassing, and
surpassing of subjectivity']{.underline}** (Protevi, 2009: xiv).5
Therefore, instead of concentrating on protest events (e.g. Sewell,
1996) or providing an analysis of its organizational profile and
tensions with existing institutions (e.g. Tilly, 1978), as sociology of
social movements often advocates, I focus instead on three Chinese
keywords -- 'Island Sunrise' (daoyu tianguang), '22K,' and 'little
assured happiness' (xiao que xin) -- as affective keys which are not
only well-circulated within the context of the movement but also
indicative of the propensities of its participants for understanding the
social, economic and political circumstances they are caught up in, as
well as their experiences of these circumstances. Together these
keywords highlight an affective cognition of **[the Sunflower Movement
as problematically articulated with/ against neoliberalism. By rejecting
black box democracy, unfair competition, and further integration with
China, the Sunflower Movement in effect refuted the future of neoliberal
globalization as the ontology of being, yet for what futures to come it
knew not.]{.underline}**

### Alt Solvency - Saudi Arabia

#### Alt Solves Saudi Arm Sales -- workers can blockade and refuse to circulate arms -- spills up, collective action just inspires more resistance

**Broder & Marchetti 19** (David Broder & Giacomo Marchetti, Giacomo is
an Italian docker.; David is a historian of French and Italian
communism. ; 6-25-2019; "We won't load your ships of death";
<https://jacobinmag.com/2019/06/italian-dockers-boycott-saudi-weapons-strike>)

Thus far, the Saudi tyrants in Riyadh have been able to count on Western
backing --- and weapons. Yet as scrutiny of their war crimes
intensifies, the edifice of support is beginning to crack. On June 20
the Senate voted to block Donald Trump's plans for \$8 billion of
weapons shipments, just hours after a ruling by the UK Court of Appeal
forced Theresa May's government to suspend arms sales to Riyadh. Yet the
first resistance came elsewhere --- from the workers meant to make the
arms shipments happen. On May 10, the **[Bahri Yanbu was unable to dock
in Le Havre as workers refused to accept the Saudi vessel, and ten days
later their counterparts in Genoa went on strike rather than load the
ship.]{.underline}** On May 28 members of the CGT union in Marseille
similarly boycotted a Canadian weapons cargo headed for Saudi Arabia on
the Bahri Tabuk. **[The workers in all three ports made clear that they
weren't willing to be mere cogs in Saudi Arabia's war machine, refusing
point blank to load what they called the "ships of
death."]{.underline}** Indeed, when fresh news spread that another ship
called the Bahri Yazan was going to dock in Genoa last Thursday, workers
and antiwar activists in the northwest Italian city were quick to
mobilize, with protests and a further strike call. The result was again
humiliation for the Saudis, as port authorities were forced to guarantee
that the workers would not have to load weapons onto the ship. Yet the
fight to cut off supplies to the Saudi war machine is far from over.
Jacobin's David Broder spoke to one of the Genoa dockers, Giacomo
Marchetti, about his colleagues' action, the political response, and how
workers can take direct action against war and militarism On May 20 the
Genoa dockers refused to load weapons onto the Bahri Yanbu, **[showing
that you were unwilling to help Saudi Arabia's war in
Yemen]{.underline}**. Where did the decision to take this action come
from, and what do you think it achieved? **[The traffic of arms through
the port was nothing new. It was something that our Autonomous Port
Workers' Collective (CALP) had publicly denounced on several
occasions]{.underline}**. But this didn't receive any particular media
attention, or indeed an adequate response from political or trade-union
organizations. **[Like many aspects of what goes on in the docks, this
arms trafficking was a "taboo.]{.underline}**" We see the same thing
with the shipments of other dangerous goods, and **[the situation of
insecurity the workers are forced to operate within.]{.underline}** It's
all part of a kind of pact (also in part including the unions) which
sacrifices everything else on the altar of the maritime business, on the
basis of a sort of omertà. You could say the same of the long-standing
failure to plan any road-based alternative to the heavy traffic over the
Ponte Morandi (the bridge in Genoa that collapsed on August 14, 2018,
killing forty-three people).**[But a series of factors --- firstly the
blockade carried out by port workers in Le Havre and a positive response
among activists in Genoa --- led to a change of pace. Under strong
pressure from the workers' delegates, as the Bahri Yanbu was approaching
Genoa the FILT-CGIL union called a strike]{.underline}**. **[A blockade
was called the day that the main shipment was meant to be
loaded.]{.underline}** A group of workers thus gave their own kind of
"welcome" to the Saudi vessel. Another important factor in getting
people to mobilize for the first blockade was the "pre-electoral"
climate (it took place just days before the European elections) as well
as the clear position taken by a vast array of associations, including
ones of a Catholic orientation. That said, ultimately it was a group of
"inglorious bastards" among the dockers, and their **[determination to
ramp things up a notch and create a precedent, that proved decisive to
making the strike call happen.]{.underline}** As for what we've
succeeded in doing, **[we've made people start talking about the
long-overlooked conflict in Yemen.]{.underline}** We've made them talk
about the traffic of Western-made weapons that feed wars causing vast
humanitarian disasters. **[And we've reasserted collective action as a
tool for addressing the problems in front of us --- including in
response to issues whose importance extends beyond our own
workplaces.]{.underline}** This was a beginning. And after our action on
May 20, eight days later the dockers in Marseilles did the same.

### Alt Solvency - Arm Sales

#### Reforms and demands of the state to end arms sales in the name of human rights is naïve and doesn't solve for anything but rather acts as a guise by cooperation's that support capitalism

**Socialist Studies 15** (The media organization of the socialist party
of Great Britain; Winter 2015; Socialist Studies No 98;
<https://libcom.org/files/socialist-studies-98.pdf>)

[These weapons have not just given military support to the bombardment;
they have also provided a strong political support]{.underline} and
underlined the closeness between the UK and Saudi governments. With the
destruction of Yemen and the intensifying crackdown on dissent in Saudi
Arabia, the UK Government is sending the message that [human rights and
democracy are less important than arms sales]{.underline} Saudi Arabia
has spent an estimated £2.5 billion upgrading its fleet of 73 Tornados
as part of a deal negotiated with UK­based arms manufacturers BAE
Systems. For the British [government **arms sales are more important
than human rights** and democracy.]{.underline} The welcome reception
and red carpet treatment of Cameron's VIP guests such as president Xi
(China), Modi (India) and al­Sisi (Egypt) with their appalling human
rights records, underlines this point: democratic values are low on the
British government's list of priorities. [If you do not like the effects
of capitalism such as international rivalry, armament production and
war]{.underline} it is no good moaning and writing pointless "Why Oh
Why?" letters to the GUARDIAN; [you have to abolish the capitalist cause
and replace the profit system with socialism. It is sheer naivety to
believe that organisations like CAAT will make any difference to
government policy. Like all single issue groups, **CAAT believes you can
have capitalism without the effects of capitalism. You
can't**]{.underline}. CAAT, like all reformist single ­issue groups
believe their issue and their issue alone is the most important. [They
tell us they we must "do something now" to stop the death and
destruction around the world caused by capitalism's wars.]{.underline}
Well, we are. [Our immediate object is capitalism's abolition and its
replacement with socialism**. The immediate need of the working class is
not reform politics** and the vain attempt to prevent Britain selling
arms to despots, dictators and authoritarian regimes, but freedom from
exploitation and the elimination of national boundaries and rivalries.
Socialists want to see a world without armaments and war.]{.underline}
However, unlike CAAT we hold that only a world­wide system of common
ownership and democratic control of the means of production and
distribution by all of society will provide the framework in which war
will be unnecessary. In other words, [**only the establishment of world
socialism**; a society without national frontiers, conflict and
competition between nation states will end the production of arms and
the obscenity of war.]{.underline}

### Alt Solvency -- Israeli/Palestinian Worker Solidarity

#### There is a deep history of resistance by Palestinian and Israeli workers -- a praxis centered on the connections of labour to the production of society produces political coalition across national, religious, and racial lines. Marxism formulates the logic that situates settler colonial theory -- their analysis however can't reconcile the specificity of class relations in the creation of Israel as a settler state.

**Locker-Biletzki 2018 (**Amir, post-doc @ Concordia University,
"Rethinking Settler Colonialism: A Marxist Critique of Gershon Shafir",
Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

The Palestinian working class emerged out of the Arab peasantry in
Palestine**[. Growing indebtedness and the continued dispossession
forced by Zionist colonization pushed Palestinian farmers into the
coastal urban centers in search of work.]{.underline}** This class was
transitory and seasonal in nature. Palestinian workers retained close
links with their villages and moved back to the land in times of
economic distress (Lockman 1995; Tamari 1982). The 1948 war and its
disastrous effect on Palestinian society also marked a turning point in
the history of the Palestinian working class. **[The mostly falaḥim that
remained within Israel suffered an accelerated process of
proletarianization as large-scale land confiscations by the Israeli
state uprooted them from the land. By the late 1950s, as the Israeli
economy boomed and absorbed the massive Aliyah of Arabian and European
Jews, these workers entered the lower ranks of the Israeli industrial
workforce as part of a new Israeli working class made up also of Mizrahi
Jews as well as the privileged workers of the pre-1948
era]{.underline}** (Ben-Porat 1992). From the time of the Arab Rebellion
(1936--9), Palestinian workers engaged in interclass struggle. In Haifa,
shantytown migrant workers took over the rebellion, deposing the
bourgeoisie and traditional leadership (Yazbak 2003). Consider the words
of an unknown Palestinian Nazareth worker in a 1944 letter to the editor
send to the Palestinian Communist newspaper Al-Ittihad (Arabic the
Union): By publishing my words in al-Ittihad, I do not seek the sympathy
of company owners, since they have proved their desire to exploit
workers ... and I do not seek the compassion of the legislative and
executive government authorities, who have displayed their bankruptcy
repeatedly with respect to our lives and interests. \[Instead\] I'd like
to say to our Arab labor organizations and to Arab workers, to work hand
in hand to establish a higher commission to represent them suitably and
honestly reflecting their own interests and benefiting them.9 This short
passage brings out the fact that, **[by the 1940s, a Palestinian working
class unto itself had been formed, one that was aware of the rise of a
class society with antagonistic relations with the national---that is,
Palestinian---bourgeoisie.]{.underline}** The historical narrative that
I have unfolded here shows that---**[along the lines of division that
Zionist settler colonialism had drawn since the late nineteenth
century---Palestinian and Jewish workers forged their own class
struggles and organizations]{.underline}**. **[As was the case with the
Palestinian and Jewish bourgeoisie, the dividing lines were not as
rigidly drawn as Shafir would have them. Alongside the history of
conflict that settler colonialism engendered, Jewish and Palestinian
workers engaged in interclass struggle against their respective
exploiters--- mainly the British colonial state.]{.underline}**
Capitalism and Settler Colonialism in Palestine/Israel Settler-colonial
theory is a materialist theory with intellectual roots in the Marxist
tradition. However, **[settler-colonial theorists' reconstruction of
historical realities in settler societies tends to disregard the
socially varied processes of class formation and the development of
capitalist regimes. For settler-colonial scholars, the
colonizer/colonized dichotomy overshadows the proletariat/bourgeoisie
dichotomy.]{.underline}** This is evident in the pioneering work of
Gershon Shafir. His rendition of the origins of Israeli society is based
on a materialist view of the way Jewish workers effected the building of
a pure colony**[. An analysis of the history of the formation of class
among Palestinians and Jews alike shows that, while it did not comply
with a Marxist-inspired European model, where labor confronted the
political control of capital, the bourgeois class did evolve and to an
extent engaged in antagonistic relations with the laboring
class]{.underline}**. These developments largely corresponded with the
settler-colonial divide that Shafir portrays, meaning that **[Jewish
workers and Arab workers as well as Jewish and Arab capitalists
generally did not form any major interclass alliances beyond the
national dividing lines. However, one cannot entirely dismiss the
history of Palestinian and Jewish cooperation in the citrus groves and
in the joint struggles of workers from both peoples in the governmental
sector of Palestine's economy]{.underline}**. While this may not have
been the main tendency in a society that was shaped by a drive to
categorize and separate Arabs from Jews, it nonetheless lends nuance to
the largely monochromatic picture that Shafir paints of the history of
Palestine/ Israel. **[The reclaiming of this counterhistory and the use
of Marxism to interpret it within settler-colonial discourse serves to
enhance and enrich our view of the history of
Palestine/Israel.]{.underline}** This rewriting of the colonial history
of the country also includes a reclaiming of the Marxist origins of
settler-colonial theories. Apart from the Marxian elements that are to
be found in the works of Wolfe and Veracini and the historicized
materialism of Shafir, this essay has traced the Marxist
"prehistory"---one might dare to say the unacknowledged origins---of
settler colonialism in the works of Rodinson and Hilal, both committed
Marxists. **[Scholars have challenged settler colonialism from differing
points of view, raising concerns about the validity of settler
colonialism as a concept, its overemphasis on the colonizer experience,
the economistic and materialist stress of Shafir's theories, and mainly
the lack of specificity of applying the paradigm to local historical and
social conditions]{.underline}**. This essay takes on some of these
critics---mainly regarding the myopic look at local circumstances. It
attempts to include the history of the rise of capitalist class society
within the settler-colonial history of Palestine/Israel. The history of
Palestine/Israel has been reconstructed from a neo-Marxist and various
other sociological perspectives; however, this essay suggests a
different theoretical meeting point. It suggests **[we should understand
settler colonialism from less of a clear-cut vantage point that shows
the cleavages of class in both the settler and the colonized societies
and the social struggles they induce---struggles that at times blur and
defy the colonial divide that nationalist establishments wish to
reinforce and exploit]{.underline}**. As the conflict between Israelis
and Palestinians originating in late-nineteenth- century Zionism stands
at a bloody impasse, we should seek its beginnings along the critique
that Marxism offers. It must be said **[that beyond the analytical tools
the Marxist tradition can afford us, its emancipatory content can give
us hope.]{.underline}**

### Alt solvency - Gender Binaries

#### Reading a capitalist history of the nuclear family is necessary to understand the way gender binaries are produced -- the alternative's analysis solves the erasure of trans violence

Sue **Caldwell 17**, 12-19-17, \"Marxism, feminism and transgender
politics -- International Socialism",
http://isj.org.uk/marxism-feminism-and-transgender-politics/

Crucially, the development of the forces and relations of production
shaped, and continued to do so in different ways, the impact that
biology had on the position of women and the development of women's
oppression. **[This connection between productive forces and family
structure is not mechanical---each new formation builds on what came
before and is impacted also by battles between contending
classes.]{.underline}** Laura Miles locates **[the origins of trans
oppression in the enforcement of a greater rigidity of gender roles
within the emergent nuclear family that arose around the time of another
great transformation in productive forces---the industrial
revolution.]{.underline}**9 **[Women and children were pulled into the
new factories alongside men, working in horrific conditions that
resulted in a huge rise in infant mortality. The ruling class needed a
reliable supply of future labour power]{.underline}**, and some parts of
the ruling class saw that this was under threat. As Lindsey German
describes it: "It was out of these conditions that the demand for
protective legislation and the family wage came. **[They fitted in with
the changing needs of capitalism but were also in part due to the real
concerns of working class men and women for better standards of living,
safer pregnancies, healthier children and cleaner
homes".]{.underline}**10 **[The working class nuclear family was
modelled on the bourgeois family, although the reality for workers was
very different. In practice the family wage never materialised and many
women continued to work, often from home, on top of their childcare
responsibilities and for pitiful wages.]{.underline}**

### AT: FW - rotj

#### The task of the academic is to connect criticism to social values -- our Marxist practice reorients research torwards activism -- your role as a judge is to affirm the best educational strategy -- only the explicit praxis of the alternative solves.

**Stavrianakis 2006** (Anna Stavrianakis; Lecturer in International
Relations at the University of Sussex; Dec 1st, 2006; Call to Arms: The
University as a Site of Militarised Capitalism and a Site of Struggle;
<https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8da8/4ae3e1bc8b9c70afee502f943dcc04083c38.pdf>)

If we accept that research is a political activity, how are we to
proceed? Two potential strategies spring to mind. One is based on Max
Weber's dictum that "the prophet and the demagogue do not belong on the
academic platform."44 [Academics have a socially privileged role that
should not be abused by advancing political positions that carry extra
weight because of the authority invested in the speaker. For Weber,
objectivity is not the same as moral indifference, but the social
position of academic is not one for advancing political views because we
cannot choose rationally between values: that choice is "a matter of
faith" rather than empirical fact]{.underline}.45 The Weberian concept
of value neutrality refers to academics' responsibility to keep the
scientific discussion of facts separate from the evaluation of them,
having accepted that the choice of what to study is value-driven. [**The
task of an academic, in this view, is to engage in technical criticism**
and value clarification.]{.underline}46 [**This serves to identify the
repercussions of particular courses of action and the value schema that
motivate them**,]{.underline} but refrains from commenting on the
validity of those values. A second option is to [**engage explicitly as
an activist academic, making clear what one's political commitments are
and actively choosing sides**.]{.underline}47 In this scenario,
[academics explicitly choose to research instances or structures of
social injustice, often conduct research with rather than on particular
subjects, and use their research to inform campaigning and
protest.]{.underline} This is neither necessarily biased research nor
the production of propaganda (although of course, like any research, it
can be). [**The activist academic is explicit about the values
motivating her/his research** -- and as argued earlier, **value choice
is intrinsic to all research**, whether it is acknowledged or not -- and
seeks to **connect academic practice to activism**, learning from and
contributing to activist struggles]{.underline}. Engaging with
campaigners and social movements has the dual effect of putting more
pressure on government to change its policies and contributing to the
wider democratisation of social life through the sharing of skills and
knowledge among activists and academics. Both Weberian and activist
strategies share an acceptance of the political nature of all research,
and that there is no view from nowhere, but the latter strategy actively
tries to use research to challenge oppression. [Those following a
Weberian strategy may well undertake research that is critical of the
status quo, but they do not explicitly ally themselves with what they
believe to be **progressive social forces**.]{.underline}

### Critical Pedagogy 

#### Critical pedagogy is key -- the Marxist intellectual stands among the oppressed in order to mobilize revolution -- educational strategies must prioritize liberation above all else.

**Monzó & McLaren 2014** (Lilia D. Monzo & Peter McLaren; College of
Educational Studies, Chapman University; 2014;" Critical Pedagogy and
the Decolonial Option: challenges to the inevitability of capitalism";
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/pfie.2014.12.4.513;
7/27/19)

**[It is important to recognize that the selling of labor power for a
wage based on a universal standard of socially necessary labor time is a
form of exploitation]{.underline}** and that the immanent subjective
force of the worker is integral to the delineation of the objective
categories of capital -- that is, the worker has the ability to affect
her destiny through protagonistic agency, insofar as **[workers are able
to make their voices heard]{.underline}** in the context of
**[developing a philosophically grounded alternative to
capitalism]{.underline}** in all its forms, whether free market or
statist. Despite the fact that there exists a non-debate about
capitalism and a glacial indifference to the suffering of others, there
exists amidst the chaos a ray of hope, of possibility, for if we believe
that our reality today is but a contingent moment in history within
which we find our future, then the prospect of transformation and the
development of a humanity that can claim its rightful place in an
ethical world becomes a discernible possibility. **[This is a crucial
time for critical pedagogy]{.underline}** (Freire, 1970; McLaren &
Kincheloe, 2007; Giroux, 2011) **[to make its mark, as people,
especially students, may be more ready than ever]{.underline}**
**[before to question the status quo and to make demands that support
their full development as human beings]{.underline}**, including the
right to live lives free of hunger, racism, patriarchy and other
antagonisms, and to act in the world always with dignity. **[The
hallmarks of critical pedagogy are its infusion of hope and its demand
for collective social transformation through critical consciousness and
a philosophy of praxis]{.underline}** (Freire, 1970). **[Critical
pedagogy offers that possibility through its insistent and incessant
demand for collective action and a historical path for
becoming]{.underline}** (Darder, 2002). When we view ourselves as the
makers of our history, we come to realize that, above all else, **[we
must act in the service of our own humanity, even when we cannot always
foresee or guarantee where our actions will take us]{.underline}**
(McLaren, 2012). Unfortunately, critical pedagogy is currently facing
its own crisis, as educators and others 'domesticate dissent' (Macedo et
al, 2003) by diluting its revolutionary goals in favor of solely
focusing on improving conditions within the existing social structure or
denouncing critical pedagogy outright for allegedly privileging class
struggle over racism and other antagonisms. While the first of these
impediments is expected -- any social movement of significance runs a
high risk of being co-opted and used in a watered-down version to assist
rather than subvert the status quo -- the latter is one that troubles us
deeply, as **[we recognize both the theoretical and analytical strength
of a revolutionary (Marxist) critical pedagogy]{.underline}** (McLaren,
2006), but also embrace the premise, held by Freire, that our liberation
must be led by the oppressed, as they have insights into the conditions
of oppression that are unavoidably hidden from the oppressors: This,
then, is **[the great humanistic and historical task of the oppressed:
to liberate themselves and their oppressors as well]{.underline}**. The
oppressors who oppress, exploit, and rape by virtue of their power,
cannot find in this power the strength to liberate either the oppressed
or themselves. Only power that springs from the weakness of the
oppressed will be sufficiently strong to free both. (Freire, 1970, p.
44) **[Here, we wish to resuscitate the concept of the 'committed
intellectual'. We believe that the 'committed intellectual' is an
important figure of revolution]{.underline}** (Fischman & McLaren, 2005)
which is worth reinvoking at this particular historical juncture. **[The
committed intellectual stands among the oppressed rather than for the
oppressed, but with a developed theoretical understanding of the social
and material conditions of their oppression]{.underline}**. **[Her
commitment to the oppressed and to the cause of emancipation is fueled
by]{.underline}** both her personal experiences and **[her critical
understandings of how these experiences are constructed out of the
omnipotent relations of capitalist exploitation]{.underline}**. However,
the committed intellectual cannot rely on Western theories alone, for
these are informed from a world vantage point of dominance -- of the
oppressors. Here, Marxism and critical pedagogy could use the helping
hand of theories developed by our neighboring scholars to the south, in
Latin America, and other scholars with a similar geopolitical
orientation, some of whom reside in the USA. Decoloniality is a
framework developed by scholars whose work is informed through a
geopolitical location of marginality. Decoloniality frames the issues
related to class struggle, patriarchy, racism and other antagonisms
through the perspectives of the indigenous groups that were first
colonized in the Americas (Mignolo, 2009). From this theoretical
standpoint, an entangled 'colonial power matrix' or patrón de poder
colonial was instantiated through a set of interrelated social and
cultural characteristics by which the colonizers defined themselves,
including white, male, heterosexual and Christian, among others, which
were complexly related to capital accumulation and control of the means
of production (Grosfoguel, 2011). This framing has important benefits to
contemporary reality, in which **[capitalism has become a transnational
project whereby the global capitalist elite continues to be defined
through these same social relations]{.underline}**. However, we contend
that the arguments against Marxism on the basis of it being reductionist
stem more from a failure to redefine the major contributions of Marx in
light of contemporary understandings of culture and ideology. Ideology,
culture and subjectivities are accounted for in Marxism as conceived
through and within the confines of the means and forces of production
and the social relations that capitalism engenders (Ebert & Zavarzadeh,
2007**[). We are concerned here with advancing a pedagogy of
possibility]{.underline}**, where our current state of social, cultural,
economic and political turmoil **[can be seen as a historical
development of our own doing, but one that envisions a future of
possibility -- the possibility to transform ourselves and our
world]{.underline}** into that which Marx described as the 'whole
\[wo\]man', whose creative labor would be aimed at the appropriation of
nature beyond necessity towards the development of a humanist socialism.

### Aleination DA

#### Alienation DAEducation must be connected to a praxis against capitalism -- otherwise systems of learning produce alienated students who just become alienated workers -- disconnected from their reality and precluding from changing it

**Cozzarelli 17** (Tatiana Cozzerelli; current Urban Education PhD
student at CUNY; May 9^th^, 2017; "A Marxist Critique of John Dewey: The
Limits of Progressive Education";
<https://www.leftvoice.org/A-Marxist-Critique-of-John-Dewey-The-Limits-of-Progressive-Education>
; (date accessed 7/27/19)

Dewey fails to see that [**the modern education system is deeply
connected to modern forms of alienated production**.]{.underline}
Students experience alienated learning in order to prepare them for
alienated production. Thus, Dewey does not see that [**the primary enemy
of child centered education is capitalism itself**.]{.underline} Despite
pointing to central problems within the system, **[both the progressive
era and progressive education limited themselves to reforms within the
confines of capitalist democracy, which were unable to stem the tide of
corporatization. The education system that emerged in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries alienated both students and teachers. Overcrowded
classrooms, corporal punishment, lack of teacher training, run-down
facilities, and low pay characterized the education
system.]{.underline}** Of course, this was the case when there were
public schools available at all. Many Black students in the South did
not have any schools open to them, particularly any high schools.
Schools were overwhelmingly rigid environments that did not allow
children to play or explore. William Bagley's Classroom Management
stated that education should be "slowly transforming the child from a
little savage into a creature of law and order, fit for life of
civilized society" (quoted in Zinn 2003, 263). Schooling therefore had a
central role in disciplining students. [**Dewey argued that the changes
in education were reflections of the changes in society, such as the
shift in production from the home to the factory. In pre-industrial
societies, the center of production was the home and neighborhood, where
weaving, cooking, and making candles mostly took place within a few
miles of where the products would be consumed. By the early 20th
century, this process no longer took place in the home, but rather, in
factories scattered across America**.]{.underline} Ostensibly, a
discussion of production seems very detached from a discussion of
education. However, **[Dewey argued that children learned a great deal
from engaging in pre-industrial production]{.underline}**. He wrote,
[**"We cannot overlook the factors of discipline and character building
involved in this: training in habits of order and of industry, and in
the idea of responsibility, of obligation to do something, to produce
something in the world....No number of object-lessons for the sake of
giving information can afford even the shadow of a substitute for
acquaintance with plants and animals of the farm and garden, acquired
through actual living among them and caring for them.**"]{.underline}
(Dewey 1915, 24). Therefore, according to Dewey, **[the modern school
failed to engage children because students were isolated from reality
and not involved in creating anything useful]{.underline}**. A book
about nature is no substitute for direct experience with the outdoors
and taking notes from a teacher's lecture is less educational than
students working together to solve a problem. Yet, Dewey was not only
addressing an educative loss when he discussed the lack of production in
learning. He was writing about the end of pre-industrial capitalist
production in which people created a product from beginning to end. The
**[Marxist concept of alienation is that in capitalism, workers are
deprived of the right to think for themselves, creatively express
themselves, and own the products produced by their labor. In the past,
workers masterfully produced products from start to finish and could
take pride in the commodity produced.]{.underline}** Now, in order to
serve the interests of the capitalists, art, creativity, and imagination
have been eradicated from production, making workers mere cogs in the
machine of capitalist profit. What Dewey fails to see is that **[schools
are]{.underline}** merely **[reflections of capitalist
society]{.underline}**. The fact that schools divorce learning from
production reflects the fact that workers are also alienated from
production, which has been divided into repetitive and menial tasks.
Likewise, students are alienated because there is no product that
results from their learning, making it abstract and seemingly irrelevant
to everyday life. Dewey said that in pre-industrial production, "there
was continual training of observation, of ingenuity, constructive
imagination, logical thought and of the sense of reality acquired
through first hand contact with actualities. The educative forces of the
domestic spinning and weaving of the saw mill, the grist mill, the
cooper shop and the blacksmith forge were continuously operative" (Dewey
1915, 24). **[Children are alienated from their education because
education is divorced from reality and does not produce anything.
Schools prepare students to become alienated workers, teaching them to
behave, not to think, produce or understand.]{.underline}**

### Education Spills Up

#### Marxist education key to equip students with tools to challenge society's 'unfettered capitalism' after leaving the classroom

**Barton and McClaren 01** (Angela Calabrese Barton is a professor in
teacher education, research is emphasized on equity and critical
justice, Peter McLaren is Distinguished Professor in Critical Studies,
College of Educational Studies, Chapman University; date
published-6/28/2001; Capitalism, Critical Pedagogy, and Urban Science
Education: An Interview with Peter McLaren,
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tea.1035?casa_token=cz3o8nq1myIAAAAA:VauJZS7mLJdls-pu6vpZRTJRFkEAJSQEJn_1F9FdyGwLYzcRytJ_BKimBP7jhvdsBnYdWUc_xMvrZ4o>,
date accessed-7/28/19)

Calabrese Barton: The problems of science education are just a small
subsection of the problems endemic to education and capitalism. It seems
to me, then, [underlying your key issues, or rather your key questions,
is the claim that school science reform has aligned itself to the
imperatives of the capitalist marketplace rather than the goals of a
democratic socialist struggle. In other words, science education has
become more about presenting students the science they need to fit into
society rather than about educating students about how they might
produce, use, and critique science to work with and transform
society.]{.underline} Going to school does not enhance one\'s chances of
success because even if everybody was learning something, [schooling is
still about stratifying students.]{.underline} McLaren: Yes. Perhaps the
best way for me to expand upon these points you raise is to share with
you and your readers some serious concerns I have that shape my present
perspective on education in general, science in general, and then urban
science education in particular. The first point that I want to make is
about the relationship between education (generally) and capitalism.
[Our society\'s unfettered capitalism has become a dangerous prejudice
in the U.S. and worldwide and has impacted our social, political,
scientific, and education structures. Everywhere you look today,
learning is being marginalized by its stress on capitalist accumulation.
**Scientific research, education, and capitalism serve each other so
intimately that it is hard to think of one without the other**. **No
where is this more dangerous than in economically and politically
oppressed communities**.]{.underline} While capitalism, having emerged
from the shadow of Marx\'s incubus with the fall of the former Soviet
Union, continues to make good on its promises of providing considerable
consumer advantages available to large numbers of people in advanced
industrial nations, it also functions systematically as a form of global
pillage. [The neoliberal economic politics of the developed capitalist
states]{.underline} (marked by the elimination of the public sector, the
imposition of open-door free trade policies, and a draconian curtailing
of state subsidies, 848 BARTON compensations, and social protections)
[have created staggering disparities in wealth among populations in
advanced democracies. They have also intensified and expedited the flow
of surplus values from poor countries into the U.S., leaving
unprecedented levels of poverty, starvation, disease, and homelessness
in those very countries that the U.S. ostensibly attempts to
assist]{.underline} (McLaren & Farahmandpur , in press; McLaren,
forthcoming). Calabrese Barton: Yet some argue that education will
become more efficient and productive in a fiercely competitive
marketplace and that this is just what urban school systems need.
Indeed, this relationship between capitalism and education seems to be
the central thesis in the Bush administration\'s recent approach to
school reform. McLaren: An[d this link is reinforced by profitability
coinciding with the educational system, transforming it into a
billion-dollar marketplace ripe for corporate investment and prot. An
education which is subordinate to transnational capital can only be
detrimental to any attempts to bring about social justice through
education]{.underline} (McMurtry, 1998). I want to be clear here, Angie,
that as a Marxist I am not advocating social justice in the sense of
equalizing resources under capitalism. I am not trying to make
capitalism more \`compassionate\'-although that would certainly be a
step in the right direction[. I am for the abolition of capitalism both
in its private property form and its state property form. In other
words, I support the transformation towards a socialist alternative. A
democratic socialist alternative, I might add, and what Marx referred to
as the new humanism. I have labeled my position, revolutionary
materialist pedagogy, multiculturalism, etc. Let us step back for a
moment to sketch out how this relationship between education and
capitalism has developed because how this relationship developed (and
continues to develop) is just as important as its outcomes.]{.underline}

### Communities NB

#### Debate is a key space to speak truth to power- Marxist calls for solidarity in educational spaces produces communal transformation.

**Barton and McClaren 01** (Angela Calabrese Barton is a professor in
teacher education, research is emphasized on equity and critical
justice, Peter McLaren is Distinguished Professor in Critical Studies,
College of Educational Studies, Chapman University; date

date accessed-7/28/19)

McLaren: Yes, and this brings me to my third major point: that the
marriages between capitalism and education and capitalism and science
\[have\] created a foundation for science education that emphasizes
profitability and control at the expense of social justice and human
dignity. As long as society uncritically accepts the relationship
between capitalism, science, and 852 BARTON education, then science
educators will continue to be bound to discourses and social practices
responsible for needless human suffering. Instead, science education
needs to be directed to assisting an educated population with managing a
large-scale investment program for a sustainable future for humanity.
[The wealth of our nation should be measured by the elimination of class
exploitation, racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression;
by the health of a people, their creative capacities, their standard of
living, and their well-being. I feel strongly that a corporate approach
to science in our classrooms has failed to raise questions dealing with
what knowledge counts most, for whom, and for what purposes. I also feel
that it has distanced science from confronting the objectifying and
mediating functions of capitalist production and exchange relations,
deflected attention away from how the advanced imperialist order of
contemporary capitalism actually works in the production of knowledge,
swept away contradictory class interests, and cultivated an engineered
misunderstanding of how the geography of capital accumulation helps
perpetuate bourgeois power and suppress workers\' rights and
aspirations.]{.underline} Calabrese Barton: I can link your point about
distancing science from class interests to, on the one hand, how we
\`\`teach\'\' about developing countries in science class. The rare
moments when developing countries are described in typical science
textbooks tend to be in relation to disease and pollution (i.e., the
typical biology textbook picture of the poor African woman with a
goiter). The sad parallel is that, on the other hand, I can link this
very example to how little mention (or no mention) is given in these
same texts to how these poorer countries often serve as the first
clinical test beds for new drugs. Let us not forget what is also
happening in our poor centers in the U.S.-Hispanic and African American
children were immunized with the EZ measles vaccine in Los Angeles, and
their parents were not informed that the vaccine was not licensed in the
United States (Trafford, 1996). How would you say these ideas translate
pedagogically? McLaren: [**The issue for me is to create pedagogical
sites where educators and students collectively can \`\`speak truth to
power**.\'\' One of my goals is to develop learning contexts-both in
schools and in community settings-where the local habitation of such a
struggle for socialism can take root. For me, the educational system is
an important possibility in this regard. It is here that critical
pedagogy can be employed in the teaching of science.]{.underline} At
present there is a haunting absence of critical approaches to the
teaching of urban science, an enigmatic silence with respect to attempts
at conscripting teaching science into the service of social justice.
Here, Angie, I need to emphasize what I mean by social justice. I mean,
who would ever admit that they are against social justice? I am not
referring here to a liberal bourgeois notion of social justice, of
dividing up the spoils of surplus value more equitably. [Because this
agenda is still premised on the logic, the practice, and the rule of
capital. The very creation of surplus-value turns human beings into
human capital-in short, it \`\`capitalizes\'\' them, as my friend Glenn
Rikowski would say. I am against capital\'s law of value altogether.
**Social justice for me can only be achieved through the abolition of
capitalism, and through the forging of new human relations through a
socialist alternative by means of a Marxist-Humanism.**]{.underline}

### Dialectics

#### Our dialectic is key---capitalism makes today's society seem as if it is the only reasonable option in order to justify its actions. Voting negative aligns the knowledge production of debate with the value of our dialectic, expanding the possibility for the working class to change society.

**Sewell '02** (Rob Sewell; QUALS??; 11/02/02; "What is dialectical
materialism? - A study guide with questions, extracts and suggested
reading";
<https://www.marxist.com/dialectical-materialism-study-guide.htm>;
7/28/19)

For those unacquainted with Marxist philosophy, dialectical materialism
may seem an obscure and difficult concept. However, for those prepared
to take the time to study this new way of looking at things, they will
discover a revolutionary outlook that will allow them an insight into
and understanding of the mysteries of the world in which we live. **[A
grasp of dialectical materialism is an essential prerequisite in
understanding the doctrine of Marxism. Dialectical materialism is the
philosophy of Marxism, which provides us with a scientific and
comprehensive world outlook. It is the philosophical bedrock - the
method - on which the whole of Marxist doctrine is
founded.]{.underline}** According to Engels**[, dialectics was \"our
best working tool and our sharpest weapon.\"]{.underline}** And for us
also, **[it is a guide to action and our activities within the working
class movement]{.underline}**. **[It is similar to a compass or map,
which allows us to get our bearings in the turmoil of events, and
permits us to understand the underlying processes that shape our
world.]{.underline}** Whether we like it or not, **[consciously or
unconsciously, everyone has a philosophy. A philosophy is simply a way
of looking at the world. Under capitalism, without our own scientific
philosophy, we will inevitably adopt the dominant philosophy of the
ruling class and the prejudices of the society in which we live.
\"Things will never change\" is a common refrain, reflecting the
futility of changing things and of the need to accept our lot in
life]{.underline}**. **[There are other such proverbs as \"There is
nothing new under the sun\", and \"History always repeats itself\",
which reflect the same conservative outlook. Such ideas, explained Marx,
form a crushing weight on the consciousness of men and
women]{.underline}**. Just as the emerging bourgeoisie in its revolution
against feudal society challenged the conservative ideas of the old
feudal aristocracy, so **[the working class, in its fight for a new
society, needs to challenge the dominant outlook of its own oppressor,
the capitalist class.]{.underline}** Of course, **[the ruling class,
through its monopoly control of the mass media, the press, school,
university and pulpit, consciously justifies its system of exploitation
as the most \"natural form of society\". The repressive state machine,
with its \"armed bodies of men\", is not sufficient to maintain the
capitalist system. The dominant ideas and morality of bourgeois society
serve as a vital defense of the material interests of the ruling
class.]{.underline}** **[Without this powerful ideology, the capitalist
system could not last for any length of time.]{.underline}** \"In one
way or another,\" states Lenin, \"all official and liberal science
defends wage-slavery... To expect science to be impartial in a
wage-slave society is as foolishly naïve as to expect impartiality from
manufacturers on the question of whether workers\' wages ought not to be
increased by decreasing the profits of capital.\" Official bourgeois
ideology conducts a relentless war against Marxism, which it correctly
sees as a mortal danger to capitalism. **[The bourgeois scribes and
professors pour out a continual stream of propaganda in an attempt to
discredit Marxism - particularly the dialectic.]{.underline}** This has
especially been the case since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and the
ferocious ideological offensive against Marxism, communism, revolution,
and such like. \"Marxism is dead\", they repeatedly proclaim like some
religious incantation. But Marxism refuses to lie down in front of these
witch doctors**[! Marxism reflects the unconscious will of the working
class to change society. Its fate is linked to that of the proletariat.
The apologists of capitalism, together with their shadows in the labour
movement, constantly assert that their system is a natural and permanent
form of society. On the other hand, the dialect asserts that nothing is
permanent and all things perish in time. Such a revolutionary philosophy
constitutes a profound threat to the capitalist system and therefore
must be discredited at all cost. This explains the daily churning out of
anti-Marxist propaganda. But each real step forward in science and
knowledge serves to confirm the correctness of the
dialectic]{.underline}**. For millions of people the growing crisis of
capitalism increasingly demonstrates the validity of Marxism. The
objective situation is forcing working people to seek a way out of the
impasse. \"Life teaches\", remarked Lenin. Today, to use the famous
words of the Communist Manifesto, \"A spectre is haunting Europe, the
spectre of communism.\"

### Debate Key

#### The process of debate is key -- critique and argumentation are intrinsic to the development of a Marxist political project.

**Jessop and Sum 18** (Bob Jessop works in the Department of Sociology
at Lancaster University. Ngai-Ling Sum works in the Department of
Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University; 3/21/18;
"Language and Critique: Some Anticipations of Critical Discourse Studies
in Marx"; <https://www.academia.edu/36837485/Marx_and_Discourse>)

**[We conclude that much of Marx's work can be read as a series of
contributions to the critique of semiotic economy, that is, to an
account of how language and symbolism are involved in the emergence of
specific forms of social organization and contribute to the imaginary
misrecognition and misrepresentation of class (and other social)
interests.]{.underline}** As Norman Fairclough and Phil Graham argue,
Marx anticipated much of what would now be regarded as critical
discourse and/or argumentation analysis. For many of his studies
emphasized the dialectical interconnectivity of language and other
elements of the social and can there-fore do full justice to \[the\]
social power of language in ... capitalism without reducing social life
to language, removing language from material existence, or reifying
language (Fairclough& Graham, 2002, p. 187**[). Marx interpreted
language as an expression of practical consciousness and critiqued the
manual -- mental division of labor, which inclined intellectuals to
believe that ideas were the motor force of history. He engaged in
systematic, even symptomatic, critiques of the basic categories that
organized capitalist relations of production and adapted, modiﬁed, and
'translated' into corresponding juridico -- political, intellectual, and
philosophical social forms and consciousness.]{.underline}** Given that
politics, not the evolution of the productive forces, was the key moment
of social development, **[Marx also explored what nowadays some might
call the semantics and pragmatics of political discourse and
speciﬁcities of political struggle in bourgeois societies, which
involved articulating and securing support for an account of the (always
illusory) general interest that could help for a while to stabilize an
inherently contradictory, crisis -- prone capitalist social order. His
semiotic analyses were grounded in his early philosophical and
theoretical studies but remained largely pre -- theoretical and
unsystematic, however, as they served signiﬁcant heuristic and political
purposes. Marx was a pre-disciplinary scholar who focused on the
critique and transformation of bourgeois society. Later advances in
critical discourse and argumentation analysis could be used to reﬁne his
concepts and systematize his methodological tools. This is what we have
been attempting in our development of cultural political economy (Sum &
Jessop,2013). But, as we also argue, this should not be pursued at the
cost of undermining the scope for integrating critical semiotic analysis
into the more systematic critique of political economy. This was Marx's
principal intellectual project.]{.underline}**

### Agency

#### Capitalism has spread to every corner of the world and violence/consumption is at an all-time high, the system is being sustained by how students only learn and tend to the needs of the capitalists, we must reorient our pedagogy to produce new knowledge that combats capitalism and produces alternative forms of agency

**Rodriguez 9** (ARTURO RODRIGUEZ; professor and Ph. D at Boise State
University; 7/1/2009; Anti-capitalist Analytical Fusion: Science,
Pedagogy and Revolution;
<https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/esl_facpubs/19/>)

[The global market occupies virtually every corner of the struggle for
humanity]{.underline} (McLaren & Jaramillo, 2007[) children in
classrooms are the direct inheritors, as they grow to adulthood of the
sort of social and natural environment adults accept. War is class war
as those who reap the benefits, profit margins, on a global scale are
never those with most at risk; the soldiers doing the killing in the
fields benefit only so far as their use value is justified in
controlling the world via the wholesale slaughter of, "enemy
combatants." These are children and adults in the so called terrorist
states who happen to be in the way of cementing capitalist social
relations whether copper, oil, timber or human interests.]{.underline}
Furthermore the human life span is far too short for any one human being
to have an effect that significantly impacts the world market. We are
far beyond the moment where the Molotov cocktail, the baton or a rock
thrown by its self can cause the adoption among the human chain of a
worldwide position for revolution. Even when riots occur, the 1960s,
1980s or 1990s globally, the market fights individual citizens to a
standstill. Hard to throw a rock when you are starving, or when you have
to excavate rubble to recover and then bury your children. And yet [the
US has been successfully fought to a standstill, in the market by Cuba
and Venezuela and at war by Afghanistan and Iraq. Why does a military
that possesses the sole surviving global Air Force, Navy and Army
continue to make war on people that return fire from horseback using
muskets and single shot World War I era munitions? The war begun in 2003
was conceived over ten years prior; in 2009 the US is still at war with
according to Gibson, a military with no long history of defense no
internal defense industry of note, no definable supply lines, no clear
chain of command or central leadership (2009). Can it be there is more
to life and war than production or enslavement?]{.underline} The
classroom as McLaren and Jaramillo relate and as Bencze and Alsop
elaborate, were the last truly public domain where students and teachers
could engage in a respite from the dominant ideology (2009, 2009). They
could take it upon themselves to consider the social relations that
exist and their effect on the environment. According to David Hursch,
"[Neo-liberals' desire not to intervene in markets and to focus on
economic growth, primarily terms of consumption, has both significantly
contributed to the environmental problems that we face and to global
warming."]{.underline} (2009: p5) The copper canyons in Utah were not
put their by meteors but by mining operations. The depletion of salmon
and steelhead in the rivers and streams of California, Oregon and
Washington did not happen as a product of the ravages of time. [Human
constructed, petrochemicals, positions on the treatment of the
environment as things existing solely for the purpose of providing the
corporatocracy with surplus value created all of it. Critical educators
in and out of the classroom stand as a measure of change as the
onslaught of neoliberalism continues]{.underline}. People cause the
ravages of time to negatively affect the planet, surplus accumulation
whether it is PCB's in the Hudson, ammonium nitrates at the mouths of
the world's major rivers or the debris from surface and subsurface
detonations of nuclear material. [Yet there is another more insidious
form of surplus accumulation it is the toll on students in classrooms
across the globe of curricula and pedagogies ensuring students leave
classrooms functionally illiterate. Capable only of reading and acting
out the prescribed lives global capitalists have set. Human agency and
enslavement result as people live their lives careless to the effect
their actions have on the natural environment and each other.
Pedagogists in the natural and social sciences do more than share
information with their students. They leave a lasting imprint, a seed
for enlightenment, which may contribute to the production of knowledge.
But, more importantly, offer an alternative to the living currently
destroying the planet.]{.underline}

### Epistemology DA

#### The aff's "neutral knowledge" is shaped by hegemonic, capitalist hierarchies -- only resisting policy epistemologies creates change

**Morley '15** (Louise, Centre for Higher Education and Equity Research
(CHEER), School of Education and Social Work, University of Sussex,
"Troubling intra-actions: gender, neo-liberalism and research in the
global academy" Journal of Education Policy, Volume 31, Issue 1)

I have argued that **[research]{.underline}** and researcher
**[identities are]{.underline}** being **[constructed and reinforced
via]{.underline}** the optics and apparatus of
**[neo-liberalism.]{.underline}** **[Research capital is a key
performance indicator and co-constitutes reputation,
power]{.underline}**, status, rewards, and continued employment.
Individual academic identities materialise through intra-actions between
research policy discourses, performance and productivity within the
confines of key performance indicators. **[Insecurity, inequality and
individualisation are fostered]{.underline}** as part of **[ensuring the
conditions for power to exercise a hold over conduct]{.underline}**
(Lazzarato 2009). In the neo-liberalised research economy, risk is
redistributed, as **[academics are made to feel indebted to their
organisations and responsibilised for generating income]{.underline}**
in financial systems over which they have little or no control. **[What
is valued in research]{.underline}** and scholarship
**[is]{.underline}** increasingly being **[shaped by market
demands.]{.underline}** **[Income generation,]{.underline}** enterprise,
impact, **[innovation for the market and the exchange value in the
global prestige economy are dominant indicators of the value of
research.]{.underline}** Productivity and quality are connected and
classified according to financial returns and the predictability of
research utility. **[Knowledge production, custody and dissemination
processes purport to be neutral and objective, but overlap with social
and policy hierarchies.]{.underline}** The knowledge economy is
invested, situated, exclusionary and embodied, and as such, infused with
power and control. The empty signifier of excellence is frequently
invoked, yet value indicators can be unstable, transitory, contingent,
contextualised and highly gendered. The knowledge economy is driven by
the materialities of financialisation, but also by a powerful psychic
and affective economy of shame, pride, humiliation, anger,
disappointment, despair and anxiety. This represents a type of emotional
geography (Kenway and Youdell 2011), with academic identities formed and
evaluated in relation to mutable and constructed differences and
boundaries. **[Affect]{.underline}**, as Barad might say, is a
phenomenon. It is not a stand-alone thing in the world as such things do
not exist. It **[is]{.underline}** a term **[called forth through a
relationship with an apparatus]{.underline}** (Rutherford 2013). **[The
evaluative gaze of the neo-liberal research economy is the apparatus
that can provoke such a powerful affective range. Research makes the
world intelligible]{.underline}** in specific ways **[and contributes
to]{.underline}** the **[foreclosure of other]{.underline}** patterns of
**[intelligibility]{.underline}** (Rouse 2004). Additionally, the logic
of relationality suggests that **[for every winner there are many
losers.]{.underline}** From the evidence presented in my study and from
larger studies (European Commission 2008, 2011; European Science
Foundation 2009; UNESCO 2010), it seems that, globally, women are the
losers and are participating unequally in the research economy through
which social meanings and knowledge are generated. This raises questions
about whose research is having impact on policy, society and the
economy. It is also highly precarious as to if and when women receive
sponsorship from the neo-liberal winners. However, many women in my
study maintain a rational and humanistic attachment to notions of
mentoring and altruistic re-distributions of research knowledge in a
competitive economy that rewards differentiation. A question is how to
materialise women's academic identities in a global research economy
that urgently needs to renew itself. Research has been too readily ceded
to neo-liberal forces and practices. There are questions about what the
future holds for critical scholarship and whether there is an
alternative to the neo-liberal corporate logic that fosters competition,
convergence and compliance (Leathwood and Read 2013). **[A role of the
social scientist is to render the world problematic by formulating and
elaborating questions. To offer simplistic and reductive solutions of
'what works']{.underline}** formulae **[is not enough]{.underline}**
(Thrift 2007). **[Academic creativity should incorporate
transgression]{.underline}** and re-signification, and **[not just
compliance]{.underline}** and mechanistic productivity. **[This
necessitates a troubling of the neo-liberal realisms and a
re-invigoration of knowledge production as a site of
transformation]{.underline}** and change. Colley (2013) entreats
**[counter-hegemonic scholars]{.underline}** to **[act as Socratic
'gadflies']{.underline}**. This includes **[defending]{.underline}** the
autonomy of the field of the production of **[research against
heteronomy and control practices that masquerade as
democratisation.]{.underline}** **[One task for social research could be
to resist co-option by narrow research policy agendas.]{.underline}**
This involves the prerequisite to identify new optics for viewing the
social world, and to re-work tired, stale categories and vocabularies
that produce tedious social reproductions. Enterprise cannot be used
alone to solve social problems (Ball and Olmedo 2012). Most importantly,
there is a need to imagine and research desired futures. Barad (2010,
257) suggests that 'We inherit the future, not just the past'. What
foundations are current practices, exclusions and disqualifications
laying for future knowledge?

#### Epistemology -- Their studies and authors rely on a repressive neoliberal educational apparatus that has been disproven, repeatedly, by financial crises 

**Harvey '10** (David, Distinguished Prof. of Anthropology @ Graduate
Center of City U. of New York, Top-20 Most Cited Authors in the
Humanities, *The Enigma of Capital*, pp. 235-239)

When her Majesty the Queen paid a visit to the London School of
Economics in November 2008, she asked how was it that no economists had
seen the financial crisis coming. Six months later, the economists in
**[the British academy sent her a somewhat apologetic
letter.]{.underline}** 'in summary, your Majesty,' **[it concluded, 'the
failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity of the crisis and to
head it off, while it had many causes, was principally a failure of the
collective imagination of many bright people, both in this country and
internationally, to understand the risks to the system as a
whole.']{.underline}** it is 'difficult to recall a greater example of
wishful thinking combined with hubris,' **[they]{.underline}** observed
of the financiers, but **[went on to admit that everyone -- presumably
including themselves -- had been caught up in a 'psychology of
denial'.]{.underline}** On the other side of the Atlantic, Robert
Samuelson, a columnist for the Washington Post, wrote in a somewhat
similar vein: 'here we have the most spectacular economic and financial
crisis in decades \... and the one group that spends most of its waking
hours analyzing the economy basically missed it.' Yet the country's
13,000 or so economists seemed singularly disinclined to engage in
'rigorous self-criticism to explain their lapses'.
**[Samuelson's]{.underline}** own **[conclusion was that the economic
theorists were too interested in sophisticated forms of mathematical
model-building to bother with the messiness of history and that this
messiness had caught them out.]{.underline}** The Nobel Prize-winning
economist and columnist for The New York Times Paul **[Krugman
agreed]{.underline}** (sort of!). '\[T\]he economics profession went
astray,' he wrote, 'because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad
in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.' The **[British economist
Thomas Palley]{.underline}**, in a follow-up open letter to the Queen,
**[was even less generous]{.underline}**: the profession of economics
had become 'increasingly arrogant, narrow and closed minded', he wrote,
and was completely unable 'to come to grips with its sociological
failure which produced massive intellectual failure with huge costs for
society'. I do not cite these examples to single out the economists.
First off, not all of them failed. Current chair of the White house's
National Economic Council Larry Summers, in a telling analysis of the
effects of government bail-outs on financial behaviour in the wake of
the stock market crash of 1987, clearly saw where the problems of moral
hazard might lead, but concluded that the effects of government not
standing behind financial institutions would be far worse than the
effects of always bailing them out. The policy problem was not to avoid
but to constrain moral hazard. Unfortunately, when Treasury Secretary in
the late 1990s he forgot his own analysis and promoted exactly the kind
of unconstrained moral hazard that he had earlier shown might wreck the
economy (a clear case of denial in action). Paul volcker, past chair of
the Federal reserve, warned of a financial crash within five years back
in 2004. But majority opinion sided with Ben Bernanke, before he became
chair at the Fed, when he said in 2004 that 'improvements in monetary
policy' had reduced 'the extent of economic uncertainty confronting
households and firms', thus making recessions 'less frequent and less
severe'. Such was the view of the Party (and what a party it was!) of
Wall Street. But go tell that to the indonesians or the argentinians. it
is devoutly to be wished that Bernanke's prognosis in august 2009 that
the worst of the crisis is over turns out to be more reliable. **[Ideas
have consequences and false ideas can have devastating consequences.
Policy failures based on erroneous economic thinking played a crucial
role in both the run-up to the debacle of the 1930s and in the seeming
inability to find an adequate way out.]{.underline}** Though there is no
universal view among historians and economists as to exactly which
policies failed, **[it is agreed that the knowledge structure through
which the crisis was understood needed to be
revolutionised.]{.underline}** Keynes and his colleagues accomplished
that task. But by the mid-1970s it became clear that the Keynesian
policy tools were no longer working, at least in the way they were being
applied, and it was in this context that monetarism, supply-side theory
and the (beautiful) mathematical modelling of micro-economic market
behaviours supplanted broad-brush macro-economic Keynesian thinking.
**[The monetarist and narrower neoliberal theoretical frame that
dominated after 1980 is now in question.]{.underline}** **[We need new
mental conceptions to understand the world.]{.underline}** What might
these be and who will produce them, given both the sociological and
intellectual malaise that hangs over knowledge production more
generally? **[The deeply entrenched mental conceptions associated with
neoliberal theories and the neoliberalisation and corporatisation of the
universities has played more than a trivial role in the production of
the present crisis.]{.underline}** For example, **[the whole question of
what to do about the financial system]{.underline}**, the banking
sector, the state-- finance nexus and the power of private property
rights **[cannot be broached without going outside of the box of
conventional thinking. For this to happen will require a revolution in
thinking, in places as diverse as the universities]{.underline}**, the
media and government, as well as within the financial institutions
themselves. Karl Marx, while not in any way inclined to embrace
philosophical idealism, also held that **[ideas are a material force in
history]{.underline}**. Mental conceptions constitute, after all, one of
the seven spheres in his general theory of co-revolutionary change.
**[autonomous developments and inner conflicts over what mental
conceptions shall become hegemonic therefore have an important
historical role to play]{.underline}**. it was for this reason that Marx
wrote The Communist Manifesto (with Engels), Capital and innumerable
other works. These works provide a systematic critique, albeit
incomplete, of capitalism and its crisis tendencies. But as Marx also
insisted, it was only when these critical ideas carried over into the
fields of institutional arrangements, organisational forms, production
systems, social relations, technologies and relations to nature that the
world would truly change. Since Marx's goal was to change the world and
not merely to understand it, ideas had to be formulated with a certain
revolutionary intent. This inevitably meant a conflict with modes of
thought more convivial to and useful for the ruling class. The fact that
Marx's oppositional ideas have been the targets, particularly in recent
years, of repeated repressions and exclusions (to say nothing of
bowdlerisations and misrepresentations galore) suggests that they may
still be too dangerous for the ruling classes to tolerate. While Keynes
repeatedly avowed that he had never read Marx, in the 1930s he was
surrounded and influenced by many people like his economist colleague
Joan Robinson who had. While many of them objected vociferously to
Marx's foundational concepts and his dialectical mode of reasoning, they
were acutely aware of and deeply affected by some of his more prescient
conclusions. it is fair to say, i think, that the Keynesian theory
revolution could not have been accomplished without the subversive
presence of Marx lurking in the wings. The trouble in these times is
that most people have no idea who Keynes was and what he really stood
for, while understanding of Marx is negligible. **[The repression of
critical and radical currents of thought]{.underline}** -- or to be more
exact the corralling of radicalism within the bounds of multiculturalism
and cultural choice -- **[creates a lamentable situation within the
academy and beyond]{.underline}**, no different in principle to having
to ask the bankers who made the mess to clean it up with exactly the
same tools as they used to get into it. Broad adhesion to postmodern and
post-structuralist ideas which celebrate the particular at the expense
of big picture thinking does not help. To be sure, the local and the
particular are vitally important and theories that cannot embrace, for
example, geographical difference are worse than useless (as I have
earlier been at pains to emphasise). But when that fact is used to
exclude anything larger than parish politics, then the betrayal of the
intellectuals and abrogation of their traditional role become complete.
Her Majesty the Queen would, I am sure, love to hear that a huge effort
is underway to put the big picture into some sort of copious frame such
that all can see it. But the current crop of academicians, intellectuals
and experts in the social sciences and humanities are by and large ill
equipped to undertake such a collective task. Few seem predisposed to
engage in that self-critical reflection that Robert Samuelson urged upon
them. **[Universities continue to promote the same useless courses on
neoclassical economic or rational choice political theory as if nothing
has happened and the vaunted business schools simply add a course or two
on business ethics or how to make money out of other people's
bankruptcies. After all, the crisis arose out of human greed and there
is nothing that can be done about that! The current knowledge structure
is clearly dysfunctional and equally clearly illegitimate. The only hope
is that a new generation of perceptive students]{.underline}** (in the
broad sense of all those who seek to know the world)
**[will]{.underline}** clearly see that it is so and **[insist upon
changing it.]{.underline}** This happened in the 1960s. At various other
critical points in history student-inspired movements, recognising the
disjunction between what is happening in the world and what they are
being taught and fed by the media, were prepared to do something about
it. **[There are signs, from Tehran to Athens and on to many European
university campuses of such a movement]{.underline}**. how the new
generation of students in China will act must surely be of deep concern
in the corridors of political power in Beijing. A youthful, student-led
revolutionary movement, with all of its evident uncertainties and
problems, is a necessary but not sufficient condition to produce that
revolution in mental conceptions that can lead us to a more rational
solution to the current problems of endless growth. **[The first lesson
it must learn is that an ethical, non-exploitative and socially just
capitalism that redounds to the benefit of all is impossible. It
contradicts the very nature of what capital is about.]{.underline}**

#### Doubt flips the equation: capitalism operates through deception, you should assume all their evidence are lies

**Ruda '13** (Frank, Visiting Lecturer at Bard College Berlin,
"REMEMBERING THE IMPOSSIBLE: FOR A META-CRITICAL ANAMNESIS OF COMMUNISM"
*The Idea of Communism: Volume 2*, pp. 151-155)

**[One might]{.underline}** also **[say that, today, democratic
capitalist materialism somehow works like the]{.underline}** *genius
malignum*, the **[evil genius of Descartes -- deceiving us about pretty
much everything.]{.underline}** Maybe it is **[the most evil genius
imaginable, as capitalism takes the body-soul distinction and
extrapolates the body.]{.underline}** To put it again into more
Cartesian terms: in a beautiful passage from his Meditatioru, he
reflects on the \'cogito, ergo sum\' proof: **['I am, I exist -- that is
certain.]{.underline}** But for how long? For as long as I am thinking.
But perhaps no longer than that; for **[it might be that if I stopped
thinking I would stop existing; and I have to treat that possibility as
though it were actual . . .]{.underline}**'59 **[The reduction within
capitalism]{.underline}** might be said to **[function in perfect
alignment with this argument: capitalism deceives us in such a way that
we, as embodiments of the non-relation between the human and the animal,
think we do not exist in any way other than the bodily.]{.underline}**
Or, to put it another way: **[we very well know that we exist as human
animals, but we nevertheless act as if we were not; we act in a purely
animal-like fashion -- taking the position]{.underline}** of animals
that no longer dare to think, **[of animals that have been tricked by
the evil genius of capitalism and its democratic­materialist
ideology.]{.underline}** Here one can also turn to Plato. And **[one can
clarify what philosophy in such times as ours can learn from an utter
idealist.]{.underline}** It is this: **[philosophy has to assume an
anamnetical task.]{.underline}** The lesson that can already be learned
from Descartes can be rendered in the following way: **[to avoid
becoming indifferent, the human animal has to be reminded that its very
nature]{.underline}** - its freedom - **[is a-natural.]{.underline}**
Human animals are an embodiment of the non­relation between the human and
the animal, natural incamationJ of a-natura/ill;. And this a-natural
nature is only real when it takes sides, when it decides upon something.
This insight even made it to Hollywood recently. As one of the
characters of Zack Snyder\'s 2011 movie Sucker Punch 60 states: \'If you
do not stand for something, you fall for anything.\' **[But when does
one really stand for something? It is here that the idealist Plato can
help.]{.underline}** As Badiou has underlined, Plato\'s fundamental
question has always been, **[\'What is a good life?]{.underline}**\' or:
\'What is a life worthy of an idea?\' This was (and maybe still
**[is]{.underline}**) **[the question of philosophy]{.underline}**, the
question of Plato.61 **[And Plato]{.underline}** - the first ever to
defend the idea of the idea - **[gives the following answer to this
question: one does not fall for anything, but stands for something, when
one upholds and clings to an idea.]{.underline}** And, as Badiou has
shown on several occasions, an idea is always an exception to the simple
existence of what there is - of individual bodies, collective languages
and opinions. An idea is always the somehow scandalous, inhuman,
a-natural exception to the given natural realm of opinions, Turning to
Plato, **[one might claim that the first task of philosophy in our times
is to do the \'difficult work of resurrecting the idea\']{.underline}**
62 **[against the omnipresent reduction of human animals to animality.
And as we are living in a time when there seems to be no idea available,
philosophy has to work for its very resurrection - this is to say, for a
new beginning of the idea which has been and is addressed under
different names, one of these names being 'communism'.]{.underline}**
Thus it is precisely the idea ofan idea that one needs to resurrect from
idealism under present materialist conditions.63 This is how to inscribe
the distinction between materialism and idealism into materialism
itself. It is not a simple return to idealism, as we are in a situation
where we can only be materialists. Rather, it means to invert
materialism to will that they are necessary and to necessarily will it
or to be necessitated to will it - i.e. to oppose the materialism
without an idea that leads to animal humanism with a materiahmz of the
idea, a materiaLi.mz of the a-naturaL, inhu­ man Ji\'eedom of the human
animal. This can be done by inscribing a true Two:64 the Two comprising
(l) what there is, and (2) an exception. One can also render this as
follows: yes, there is only individual and collective animal-humanist
life, except that there is an idea of communist life. Such a renaissance
of idealism under materialist conditions can be character­ ized by a
formula Badiou once used to describe his own enterprise. In a text
called *Metaphyics and the Critique of Metaphysics*, he referred to his
own philosophy as \'metaphysics without metaphysics\',65 and I think
that one can concetve of the necessary philosophical act that
re-inscribes the distinction between idealism and materialism into
materialism along these very lines. This means: philosophy as a
dialectical-materialist enterprise must imply an lJeaLum witl.wut
ioeaLum. This is precisely why philosophy today has to be anamnetical.
For any idea (this is what one can learn from Plato) is essentially
good, and this leads to the following task: philosophy has to remind us
of this very fact. That any non-relative idea seems to be impossible
right now does not matter. It has already seemed impossible several
times before (and in multiple situations). No one, for example, really
believed in radical transformation in the 1840s. So, **[philosophy can
and should recall the impossible and remind us that it has already taken
place, and more than once]{.underline}**, before became possible. But,
for such an anamnetical task, historical specificity is of the utmost
importance. One needs to take into account all the experiences - the
failures - that already exist, and learn from them without drawing the
Thermidorian conclusion 66 of predominant materialism, namely that any
attempt to realize a universal collective good ultimately leads to the
instantiation of the worst imaginable. So, although it is true that we
are thinking after Plato, Descartes and Hegel, **[we have to avoid the
obscurantism of a naturalized possible/impossible distinction that
reduces everybody to the animal substratum and to a life without any
collective project]{.underline}** -- or without any relation to
something absolute (i.e. to an idea). In our historically specific
conditions, **[philosophy has to be an anamnesis to remind us that the
impossible]{.underline}** -- under the name of communism -- **[has
already become possible in the past.]{.underline}** One can see why
Descartes, Hegel and Plato become important for this very task. Already,
**[Descartes\']{.underline}** philosophical method was directed against
any form of deception or failure in judgment; he **[famously started to
doubt everything that had ever deceived him, which thus could not be
trusted any longer. One can deduce from this that]{.underline}**, in a
similar way, **[philosophy can remind us that the evil genius of
capitalism,]{.underline}** also **[in its democratic­materialist guise,
cannot and should not be trusted.]{.underline}** Capitalist democratic
materialism attempts to animalize the human animal, or to humanize the
animal aspect of it. Descartes\'s method can make us into sceptics. And
one can link this doubt to an insight Hegel formulated in his Aesthetics
where he claimed that the human is the only animal that knows it is only
an animal, and due to this very knowledge is more than an animal.67
Philosophy\'s task is to keep this very knowledge alive. One can
therefore combine the Cartesian method and the Hegelian insight with
what I claim needs to be recovered from Plato. **[Philosophy\'s task is
anamnetical. It has to remind us of the fact]{.underline}**, as one
might put it, **[that we are embodiments of the non-relation, and that
it is in our nature to be able to do the a-natural, the impossible; that
we are able to live under an idea. Philosophy takes up the method of
doubt to restore the knowledge of the human animal and remind us of the
idea of an idea. It is in this way that it can emancipate us from any
reductive naturalization.]{.underline}**

## AT: Perm Generic

### AT: Perm --Arms Policy focus fails

#### The reduction of resistance to policy analysis is a direct tactic of capitalist hegemony of education to limit out class resistance -- the perm risks cooption and perpetuates capitalism

**Stavrianakis 6** (Anna Stavrianakis; Lecturer in International
Relations at the University of Sussex; Dec 1st, 2006; Call to Arms: The
University as a Site of Militarised Capitalism and a Site of Struggle;
<https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8da8/4ae3e1bc8b9c70afee502f943dcc04083c38.pdf>)

**[University investments in and relationships with arms companies and
the MoD raise the wider issue of the role of the university in
contemporary UK society, and the appropriate relationship between
academic research and activism. Universities can be understood as sites
of struggle, of]{.underline}** "**[both domination and
contestation]{.underline}**."38 The educational apparatus (in its public
and private forms) is a key organ of civil society that helps generate
consent and, thereby, hegemony.39 **[Universities help reproduce the
means of production and, alongside schools, are one of the most
significant social institutions in which children and (predominantly
young) adults learn the attitudes and social rules required for
the]{.underline}** **[perpetuation of the capitalist
system]{.underline}**. The engineering and social science research
carried out at Bristol thus fulfils a dual function of contributing to
the development of weaponry and legitimising this process and the
militarisation of social life that accompanies it. Social science
research that normalises the use of force also plays a significant role
in contributing to capitalist hegemony. While universities bolster
hegemonic social formations, they can also play a role in fostering
counter-hegemony, however, as the student protests demonstrate. **[We
need to interrogate the ways in which universities "mediate and
legitimate the social and cultural reproduction of class, racial, and
gender relations in the dominant society" and also serve oppositional
interests]{.underline}**.40 They do this through the alliances they
forge with other social forces (e.g. through investments), and through
research and teaching. The focus of this section now turns to research
in the social sciences (in particular, International Relations (IR), my
own discipline) and the potential for activist scholarship. **[If
universities are sites of both domination and contestation, what does
this mean for research? Primarily, it means that]{.underline}** **[it is
a political activity]{.underline}**. **[That is, what academics choose
to research (and what they put on their teaching syllabi) is intimately
related to their worldviews and value systems]{.underline}**. As Max
Weber argued, "all knowledge of cultural reality ... is always knowledge
from particular points of view."41 Issues that require and/or receive
academic investigation do not exist objectively but within a frame of
reference that constitutes them as a problem: "without the
investigator's evaluative ideas, there would be no principle of
selection of subject-matter and no meaningful knowledge of the concrete
reality."42 At present, it is only those arguments that challenge
mainstream values and ideas that are recognised as political: the
inherent political situatedness of mainstream arguments goes unnoticed
precisely because it is unremarkable.43 This applies as much to
scientists and engineers as it does to IR scholars. As documented above,
the problems for which scientists and engineers seek solutions exist
within a framework that is significantly influenced by the needs of the
arms industry. The problems that IR scholars seek to analyse are
influenced by the frameworks governing the discipline, such as the
ESRC's emphasis on priority areas and demands for policy engagement.
This emphasis, in addition to the principle of having to apply
competitively for funding to carry out research, a core academic duty,
serves to orient the discipline in particular directions, towards the
instrumentalisation and commercialisation of academic research. Even
those who seek to "play the game" further entrench the principle of
external funding and reproduce the discourse of policy relevance in
order to win resources to conduct their own, critical research**[.
Conducting policy-relevant research is not necessarily antithetical to
challenging oppression: targeted interventions in the policy process can
be effective, but run the significant risk of co-option. Being accepted
as policy relevant requires that one use the same vocabulary and
conceptual language as those making or implementing policy, and this
generally requires acceptance of the parameters within which a policy is
framed]{.underline}**. Even those who seek to use this vocabulary for
strategic gain have to negotiate the hurdles of co-option and
neutralisation. **[Policy relevance is often reduced to improving the
processes through which a policy is implemented; yet such an approach
sidelines debate about the values and goals that inform policy. It is
difficult for those who seek to challenge oppression through policy
engagement to have an impact on value choices,]{.underline}** however.
They are unlikely to have access to or credibility with elite actors
because their critical stance disadvantages them in the networking that
is intrinsic to academia (as in any other profession).

### AT: perm -Palatability DA

#### Palatability DA -- The perm waters down the alternative's revolutionary nature -- in becoming palatable it loses the necessary antagonism of class politics

**Fernandes 17** (Sabrina Fernandes; Sabrina Fernandes is a Brazilian
eco-socialist organizer and communicator with a sociology PhD from
Carleton University, Canada.; 2017; "Crisis of Praxis: Depoliticization
and Leftist Fragmentation in Brazil"
<https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/1a4b760a-db03-49c0-8096-6254d98bb4e4/etd_pdf/b0cbf7e27cbd866b6484a0baad4bd13b/fernandes-crisisofpraxisdepoliticizationandleftistfragmentation.pdf>;
Date Accessed 7/27/2019)

**[Palatability Finally, there is a warning of post-political elements
in the Brazilian left, including the radical left, regarding the need to
be more palatable under a crisis of representation and what palatability
means in terms of a post-political environment that is not keen on the
antagonism that ought to be at the core of radical left politics. By
palatability I mean a tactical dilution of some struggles and statements
in order to appear to a wider base. It entails a particular aesthetics
of the political party, social movement, labour union and collective
that is welcoming and less defined by arduous work, external and
internal conflict, self-critique and constant dealings with
antagonism.]{.underline}** When political intolerance means political
antagonism (which is different from ultrapolitical \"violent\"
intolerance informed by hatred), the promotion of political tolerance
instead may weaken the left's prospects for politicizing important
subjects, especially in terms of class exploitation. **[It is
problematic to embrace tolerance as the opposite of antagonism (and as
an ideal post-political tactic) for a few reasons.]{.underline}** First,
it appeals to a kind of moralism that often turns against the left
through misinformation and the rejection of ideological stances. The
left may try to appear as the good guys who are tolerable and
understanding, but to do so is fruitless when the hatred promoted
involves a consolidation of the view of the left as "communists who eat
children", as one interviewee who deals with the challenge of
politicizing an audience captive by common sense and right-wing media
punditry put it (Basso, 2015). **[In efforts to appear friendly, the
left may end up relegating the loud antagonistic aspects that are
fundamental to politicizing its own side of the struggle. This critique
is often made of Podemos in Spain, which is perhaps the most visible
example of a conscious softening of positions "in order to become more
palatable to voters of a more centrist persuasion"]{.underline}** (R. T.
Garcia, 2015). More often than not, such softening has to do with
electoral aspirations, where victories are in need in a much faster pace
than can be achieved even if the left was whole and even in the fastest
mode of re-politicizing under the current circumstances. In Brazil,
palatability is connected to the same elements mentioned before,
primarily the notion of radical or full democracy. One of the PSOL's
television inserts in 2016 illustrates this well, since it constantly
attributes benefits of social struggle, building poder popular, and what
ultimately is the fight for socialism into the results of a more perfect
democratic experiment (PSOL, 2016). This is concerning because to appear
as an electoral alternative, the party opts to promote its class-based
struggles as democratic struggles instead, which may result in
depoliticization by associating social and political gains with ideals
around human rights and social rights rather than social justice and the
antagonism that expresses that a democracy of the people would actually
entail taking away the privileges of a majority that just will not allow
it come easily. Promotions like this one have led the PSOL to be seen as
a palatable alternative (C. Garcia, 2015), since arguments around
democracy and human rights are more easily digestible to the
working-class and those sitting in the middle under a period of
depoliticization. It does not mean, however, that this makes the PSOL
"less revolutionary", since the opposite tactic of self-proclamation and
vanguardism hurts revolutionary prospects all the same. **[What it means
is that a softening of political positions (much more than any concern
for a softened speech) indicates a strong focus on palatability as a way
to have victories under intense depoliticization. It implies molding
one's programme to common sense, rather than politicizing from common
sense into good sense.]{.underline}** Since the crisis of representation
has had such a post-political focus on democratic drive, it is
understandable why organizations looking for such gains may deposit so
much effort in the promotion of democracy as a system for which to
struggle. Jodi Dean argues that the defense of democracy can indeed be
radical and important for the left and I believe this is the case when,
in an ultra-political struggle, one has to defend basic democratic
principles in order to prevent more attacks on the working class. This
is clear to see when the radical left has to appeal to democracy during
the period of right-wing offense that led to an illegal process to
remove Rousseff from the presidency. However, the appeal to democracy
has most often appeared in contemporary leftism as a goal in itself, a
substitute in the struggle for socialism (or communism), as if one could
struggle for democracy and then the rest would follow (Dean, 2012, p.
57). The fight for social rights becomes associated with the fight for
deepening the democracy in Brazil, a sort of "democratization \[...\] of
power" (Rahmeier, 2016) which (inadvertently) sublimates into democratic
drive under post-political hegemony. To speak of democracy is easier
than to speak of socialism, and to attach "democratic" before
"revolution" certainly makes things more palatable without the need to
get into definitions, history, practices, political tradition, and, most
importantly, the antagonism that democracy does not harness but quashes;
that is, all that baggage that surely accompanies politicizing efforts.
The problem is that if you only speak of democracy, or attribute to
democracy victories that it can never lead to, the essence of the
struggle becomes subordinated to democratic process. **[The promotion of
mottos such as "You don't have to agree, just to respect"38 give space
to the deepening of post-politics by normalizing and managing conflict,
rather than engaging in it with the intention of resolving it through
counter-politicization.]{.underline}** While there is an effort to
remove the element of hatred, which is at the core of the
ultra-political scenario, **[the notion that conflict can be managed
through tolerance/respect is depoliticizing in and out of itself because
of what tolerance replaces: a political approach to antagonism and
itsimportant role in creating class consciousness, and the difference
between conflict management and actual political, dialectical, dialogue.
It fails to see that real dialogue is intolerant, in the sense of being
intransigent, since it engages with the right-wing other without having
to accept the premises around privilege and exploitation that inform
their side of the struggle.]{.underline}** It also tells the difference
of those you can engage in dialogue with, with politicization involved,
and those you ought to be strongly opposed to in all aspects (e.g.: the
anti-fascist fight). To manage conflict by establishing respect as an
imperative covenant forecloses the possibility for rebellion, whereas
dialogue allows for rebellion and antagonism at the same time it may
also endeavour to surround most environments with respect because of its
productive effects, rather than respect as a stand-in for passivity and
tolerance. Internal intolerance inside of the left, often confused with
intransigence (see Chapter 7) isolates organizations from each other,
which cannot be the case in re-politicizing efforts. This indicates that
by being palatable, promoters of consensus and tolerance, the left may
be giving up on important opportunities to politicize, which further
enforce post-political tactics while leaving the left to drown in the
growing hatred of ultra-politics. Given this, it is important to expand
the discussion from postpolitics into ultra-politics, which is the
subject of the following chapter.

### AT: Perm - Analysis

#### The perm fails, critical pedagogy's surface level analysis of capital exchanges and distribution while ignoring the internal logic of capitalism

**Ford and Malott 15** (Curry Malott and Derek R. Ford, both have Ph.Ds
in education, both professors in West Chester University of
Pennsylvania, USA and Syracuse University, New York, USA, October 2015,
Contributions to a Marxist Critical Pedagogy of Becoming: Centering the
Critique of the Gotha Programme: Part Two;
<http://www.jceps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3-13-2-3.pdf>)

[As with the socialists critiqued by Marx and Engels, critical pedagogy
today focuses on the readily visible consequences of capital (i.e.,
issues of exchange and distribution) without grasping its internal
logic, which plays a structurally determining role in its historical
development.]{.underline} Paula Allman, Peter McLaren, and Glenn
Rikowski (2005) have referred to this as the "box-people" approach. In
this approach, [social class is determined by checking boxes with
varying levels of income, consumption power, social status, and so on.
The focus on the consequences of capital also fails to grasp the
hegemonic and counter-hegemonic manifestations of human agency mediating
capital's transformation through time and space. Again, Marx's body of
work offers crucial insights for correcting these shortcomings. However,
as suggested above, contrary to Marx's time, capitalism today is in a
descending phase, which requires some updating.]{.underline} Despite
this disclaimer, the key insights and arguments of Marx (and Engels)
remain relevant. Within the context of the savagery of capitalism's
internal logic and drive that Marx (1867/1967) so painstakingly uncovers
in volume 1 of Capital, his Critique of Gotha Programme as pointing to a
post-capitalist future takes on its full urgency and vitality. Marx's
(1875/2002) critique is thorough, systematic, and relentless. [He begins
his assault attacking the programs' very first sentence that claims that
labor is the source of all wealth. In response Marx]{.underline}
(1875/2002) [argues that: Nature is just as much the source of use
values (and it is surely of such that material wealth consists!) as is
labor, which is itself only the manifestation of a natural force, human
labor power. What Marx]{.underline} (1875/2002) [is rallying against is
an analysis that disconnects humanity from what he identifies as the
system of nature]{.underline} (Marx, 1844/1988), [which is the source of
the objects of our need, and without it, life cannot exist. What is
more, the entire basis for capitalistic wealth is based upon the
expropriation of the laborer from the soil, from nature]{.underline}
(Marx, 1867/1967). [That is, capitalism cannot function without a
working-class who have no direct access to land, to nature, and thus,
out of necessity, must sell their capacity to work for a wage---one of
the primary sources of both exploitation and permanent
alienation.]{.underline} Making this point in his critique Marx
(1875/1988) essentially charges the Gotha Programme with failing to
break with bourgeois ideology: [The bourgeoisie have very good grounds
for fancifully ascribing supernatural creative power to labor, since it
follows precisely from the fact that labor depends on nature, that the
man who possesses no other property than his labor power must, in all
conditions of society and culture, be the slave of other men who have
made themselves the owners of the material conditions of labor. He can
only work with their permission, and hence only live with their
permission.]{.underline} (p. 3) [**What this points to is a critical
pedagogy focused on developing a critical consciousness and gaining
control over one's creative capacities or labor power**, thereby ending
the appropriation of surplus labor hours, but not as an end in itself,
but as part of the process of liberating the system of nature from the
bourgeois' monopolistic control. With this in mind, it is worth
reflecting on what this might mean for public education. In the spirit
of showing students what this might look like in practice, it is not
enough to challenge the neoliberal privatization of public education, as
tends to be the focus in the United States, for it does nothing to
subvert the way in which the system of nature is being held hostage
against the majority and plundered for wealth extraction through the
command and domination of society's collective labor power]{.underline}
(despite a long, ongoing tradition of working-class resistance). In
Malott's experience working with a relatively small group of
activist-educators employed by the Curry Malott & Derek R. Ford 86 \| P
a g e Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) who are
active members of their union, the Association of Pennsylvania State
College and University Faculties (APSCUF), it is a difficult task just
convincing their colleagues on their own campus that privatization is
neither good nor inevitable. [The challenge of building a campus-wide
movement to challenge capital itself remains a daunting task. However,
the leap from challenging privatization, or the intensification of
capitals' appropriation, to questioning the viability of capital, is not
a far one. The logic is simple enough: If more unrestricted capitalism
is undesirable, then no capitalism must be best.]{.underline} [If this
is so, then what exactly is it about capitalism that is so unwelcome?
And what might an alternative look like and how might we realize it?
These discussions, touched on throughout this essay, can and should be
had]{.underline} (see Hudis, 2012). In short then, what exists as a
counter movement to capital in the U.S. tends to be focused on resisting
neoliberalism, but not capital itself. Again, putting the difficulty
here in content, it is worth restating that building support for a
movement against privatizing public education is not easy outside of
small critical pedagogy and socialist circles. [Marx's challenge for a
socialist alternative represented in this essay offers a vision of the
future, properly articulated through a collective movement, we believe,
would be widely accepted despite the many ideological
challenges.]{.underline} For example, Noam Chomsky has made frequent
reference to the fact that many Americans who self-identify with
pro-capitalist politics, such as those associated with the Democrats,
Republicans, and the Tea Party, when questioned on specific policy
issues, actually support a program quite far to the left, including
universal healthcare, livable wage mandates, and free universal
education.

### AT: Perm -- Shift

#### Limiting of arm sales just maintains colonial control over international relations -- the aff just maintains the status quo because arms control is reclassified and shifted to other means

**Grant 2012** (Jonathan A. Grant, is a Professor of Modern Russian
History, and Chair of the Department of History at Florida State
University in Tallahassee, December 2012, "\"Merchants of Death\": The
International Traffic in Arms",
http://origins.osu.edu/article/merchants-death-international-traffic-arms/page/0/1)

**[The notion that states should limit arms exports for the general sake
of peace and the avoidance of war emerged out of the public disgust with
the private arms trade following the First World War. The newly formed
League of Nations took up the cause of controlling the arms traffic as
part of its larger mission of general disarmament during the interwar
era. However, these efforts at regulating the weapons trade
all-too-often foundered. The European colonial powers recognized the
danger of the arms trade to the stability and control of their empires,
and thus found a common interest in strictly regulating the arms
traffic. However, the smaller states rejected this course of action on
the grounds that their sovereignty would be reduced and their security
eroded by the de facto control of the arms trade by the few Great
Powers. Despite the failure to achieve effective international control
over the arms trade through an officially accepted Arms Traffic
Convention, the interwar period did see some principles of arms control
established, including the licensing of arms exports and publication of
export figures. Thus, by the end of the 1930s, Belgium, Sweden, France,
Britain, and the United States had established the peacetime licensing
of arms exports as normal practice.]{.underline}** The attempts to
control arms exports gained their greatest momentum during the two
decades following the First World War. In particular, the arms embargo
on warlord China from 1919 to 1929 represented the most sustained effort
of this kind. Initiated by the United States and then joined by Britain
and France, the purpose of the Chinese arms embargo was to end internal
fighting and prevent any further disintegration of the country. However,
many other countries did not sign on and private firms pursued a brisk
business**[. Nevertheless, the China arms embargo did mark the first
international embargo against a single country. Although warlord China
did not serve as the most important arms market in terms of size (China
ranked fifteenth globally as an arms importer), the demands of 1,300
warlords waging 140 provincial and inter-provincial wars between 1912
and 1928 did generate lucrative opportunities for a variety of arms
traffickers. Official arms traders could be found working within the
various foreign legations in Beijing, but the majority of the arms
dealers worked as independent contractors lacking formal connections
with a foreign government or a private armaments maker. Included in the
ranks of these private middlemen were South Asians, Russians, Japanese,
overseas Chinese, and entrepreneurs in Canada and United States who
smuggled arms from North America.]{.underline}** Bodosakis, Göring and
the Spanish Civil War In the decade following the end of the arms
embargo in China, the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) between the
Nationalists (under General Franco) and the Republicans proved a boon
for arms trafficking, and the lure of Spanish gold attracted all sorts
of odd political bedfellows to the Spanish arms market. Perhaps the most
dissonant case involved the Greek arms dealer Prodromos
Bodosakis-Athanasiades. Bodosakis was the chief shareholder and
executive of the Greek Powder and Cartridge factory, the main gunpowder
and firearms factory in Greece. Bodosakis' pecuniary motives led him to
supply both the Nationalists and the Republicans, and he arranged
shipments so that the best and latest weapons went to Franco while the
oldest and least serviceable arms were delivered to the Republicans. The
Greek factory was in business with the German armaments firm
Rheinmetall-Borsig, an enterprise in which Hermann Göring, head of the
German Luftwaffe, had personal financial interests. **[Even as Nazi
Germany officially backed the Nationalists and German pilots were flying
missions on behalf of the Nationalist cause, the Republicans purchased
arms from Nazi Germany through the personal agency of Göring. In this
instance, Göring, who was free-lancing the sales for personal profit,
arranged a secret arms deal to the Republicans that included 19,000
rifles, 101 machine guns and 28 million cartridges shipped from Hamburg.
When Bodosakis received Spanish requests for arms, he passed them on to
Rheinmetall. The Greek government then provided end-user certificates
stating that these arms were for the Greek army. When the shipment
reached Greece from Germany, Bodosakis then transferred the cargo to
another vessel supposedly bound for Mexico. However, the vessel actually
went to Spain. In 1937 and 1938 the Republic's purchases of weapons from
Nazi Germany reached their peak. As a key participant in this arms
trafficking, Bodosakis' company was taking shipments from Rheinmetall
worth up to 40 million Reichmarks (£3.2 million) at a time. These
consignments were almost all for Republicans, and generated payments to
Göring and members of the Greek government. Bodosakis even worked with
the Soviet Union.]{.underline}** In November 1937 he signed a contract
with the Soviets to provide the Republicans with ammunition worth £2.1
million. Samuel Cummings and the Private Arms Trade after World War II
During the Cold War era (1945-1989) arms trafficking again received a
huge boost thanks to the vast quantities of war surplus equipment
located in depots around the world following World War II. Precisely at
this time Samuel Cummings emerged as the world\'s biggest small-arms
dealer. He founded his private company, Interarms, in 1953 and managed
to control 90 percent of world\'s private trade in guns. Cummings ran a
legitimate and open business selling to the American civilian market of
hunters, sportsmen, and collectors as well as to governments. He built
his gun business from the debris of World War II by amassing the German
Army surplus littering the battlefields in Western Europe. He also
offered to buy surplus weapons from government arsenals. In his first
deal, Cummings made \$20,000 by purchasing 7,000 weapons from the
surplus of the Panamanian government and selling them on the U.S.
civilian market. After touring Europe he bought up German surplus left
in bunkers in Holland and sold the material to the government of West
Germany. Cummings ultimately bought and sold more rifles and ammunition
than Eisenhower needed for the invasion of Normandy and the defeat of
the Wehrmacht. By end of the 1950s, Cummings had approximately 2 million
weapons in England alone. By his tally he bought 4.5 million weapons and
500 million bullets in Europe in the period 1953-1968. Avowedly
apolitical and neutral, Cummings' business did \$100 million annually
with factory and arms depots in Manchester, England and Alexandria,
Virginia. He supplied guns to overthrow the Guatemalan government in
1954, sold arms to Castro and Batista, and to both sides in the Costa
Rican Civil War. By far his biggest arms deals came from Spain. Over the
course of two purchases in 1959-60 and 1965-66, Cummings bought up the
entire surplus from the Spanish Civil War, thereby acquiring 1 million
weapons and 250 million rounds of ammunition. Scrupulously law-abiding,
Cummings paid all his taxes, and every sale was licensed and approved by
British and American governments. Interarms even abided by a UN arms
embargo to South Africa 1963**[. The Cold War and State-Level Arms
Dealing The Cold War rivalry between the Communist world and the West
greatly contributed to the expansion of the global arms trade. In
general the supply of arms and military equipment became one of the most
powerful weapons in international diplomacy, and both the United States
and the Soviet Union gave a high proportion of their foreign aid in this
form. For the first time in modern global history, country-to-country
transactions came to typify the arms trade. Whereas Sam Cummings' arms
business dominated the private trade in the millions of dollars, the
Cold War arms bonanza of government-to-government weapons trade operated
in the billions of dollars. Prior to 1970 world military exports rarely
exceeded \$5 billion annually and less developed countries accounted for
less than half of those sales. In the period 1973-1980, however, the two
Super Powers (USA and USSR) together supplied two-thirds of all arms
imported by less developed countries, and arms exports dramatically shot
up thanks]{.underline}** **[to the petro-dollars generated by the oil
shocks of the 1970s.]{.underline}** From 1978 to 1985, Third World
countries ordered \$258 billion worth of arms and ammunition including
13,960 tanks and self-propelled artillery, 27,605 armored personnel
carriers, 4,005 supersonic aircraft, and 34,948 surface-to-air missiles.
In terms of technical changes, World War II had stimulated tremendous
advancements in light automatic weapons. Most famous of these is the
AK47, the Soviet automatic machine-gun which was engineered during the
war but would come to dominate the light weapons traffic globally in the
Cold War and post-Cold War eras. Approximately 70-100 million AK47s have
been produced worldwide since 1947. In 1975 Communist Vietnam became
heir to huge numbers of arms available following the Communist victory
and American withdrawal from the war in Southeast Asia, including
roughly 2 million small arms (M16s) and 150,000 tons of ammunition. Many
of these abandoned American weapons found their way back to Central
America in the 1980s, as the Vietnamese traded them to the Cuban
government in exchange for foodstuffs. The Cubans then trafficked the
weapons into Central America to support the spread of revolution by
supplying the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the FMLN in El Salvador.
Vietnamese trading of American war surplus from the Vietnam War led to
the largest illicit arms shipment ever intercepted in transit from the
United States to Mexico. In March 1997 U.S. federal agents discovered
containers of leftover American automatic rifles and rifle parts which
had been shipped from Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) to Singapore, then to
Bremerhaven (Germany), and thence through the Panama Canal to Long
Beach, California for delivery in Mexico. Back to Africa Since 1945,
conflicts in Africa have caused on the order of 6.5 million deaths, with
most of these casualties due to light weapons, especially automatic
weapons. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, vast
numbers of light weapons were released from controls and entered the
international arms market. Estimates of the total value of legal exports
of light weapons globally reach \$5 billion, while the value of the
illicit trade may range from \$2 billion to \$10 billion. Africa is so
saturated with weapons that an AK47 can be purchased for \$10. Since the
1990s, West Africa experienced some of the most devastating armed
conflicts in the world. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
has estimated some 8 million illicit small arms and light weapons are
already present in West Africa. Nigerian sources worry that 1 million
such arms may be in Nigeria alone. Liberia used a series of questionable
end-user certificates to acquire military equipment from former
communist countries in 2000-2001, and Viktor Bout's Russian company
transported much material from Ukraine. Bout and the 21st-Century Arms
Trade Just as Zaharoff, Bodosakis, and Cummings were emblematic of the
arms trade in their respective eras, Viktor Bout's business career as an
arms transporter reveals much about globalization in the post-Soviet,
post-Cold War world. **[Working with the abandoned military surplus of
the Soviet bloc that unpaid or underpaid soldiers and commanders were
only too eager to sell for ready cash, Bout funneled the wares through
an intricate web of supply chains involving up to 30 different companies
and superficially legitimate end-user certificates to deliver arms
around the globe. In learning from Bout's case, however, it would be a
gross misunderstanding to view the current problems of gun-running and
weapons trafficking as recent developments or as primarily resulting
from the international consequences of Cold War rivalries. The preceding
five centuries of firearms trafficking around the world shows that the
gun markets are deeply embedded in the international landscape. And as
with previous efforts to control the weapons trade, the various recent
UN arms embargoes have largely failed to limit access to
weapons]{.underline}**. Since 1990, arms embargoes have been imposed to
end civil wars in the former Yugoslavia (1991 and 1998), Somalia (1992),
Liberia (1992 and 2001), Rwanda (1994), and Sierra Leone (1997**[). The
embargo in Somalia has been in place for many years now, yet warlords
and private militias remain well equipped with AK47s and other weapons.
Each successive historical period has brought forth bigger waves of the
supply and demand for firearms, which have overwhelmed the attempts to
monitor and control the trade through export licensing schemes and
international agreements.]{.underline}** And one thing is clear. The
easy accessibility of weapons, especially in the developing world, and
the ineffective efforts to control the trade have contributed
significantly to the devastating violence we see in the world today.

### AT: Perm -- Shift (Saudi Arabia)

#### Stopping arms sales to Saudi Arabia won't change anything- the plan accelerates Saudi militarization

**Stratfor 18** \[Stratfor, 11-9-2018, \"Saudi Arabia Lays the
Foundation for a Defense Industry of Its Own,\" Stratfor,
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/saudi-arabia-defense-industry-weapons-imports-vision203\]

**[Saudi Arabia, flush with money, nestled in a hostile environment and
saddled with demographic shortcomings, has long spent freely to bring in
weapons from abroad. And over the past five years, driven by its
intensifying competition with archrival Iran and a heavy military
commitment in the Yemen conflict, this trend has
accelerated.]{.underline}** During the period of 2013-17, the number of
arms systems the Saudi government purchased grew by 255 percent compared
with its acquisitions from 2008-12, ranking it behind only India among
global arms importers, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. Middle Eastern heavyweight Saudi Arabia is the
world\'s second-biggest arms importer. But **[a dependence on foreign
sources of weapons leaves the kingdom vulnerable to political pressures
from the countries that sell them. To preserve its independence, while
improving its economic and employment prospects, the kingdom has
increased its emphasis on developing a robust domestic defense industry.
As Saudi Arabia pursues its regional interests, it has increasingly
sought to insulate itself from outside influence. To guard against
dependence on arms imports, which could subject it to political
pressure, it has worked to build up the capabilities of its own defense
industry.]{.underline}** This shift in philosophy comes as the
kingdom\'s usual arms suppliers increasingly reconsider the extent of
their weapons trade with Riyadh because of mounting casualties from
Yemen\'s civil war and outrage over the apparent murder of Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Besides lessening dependence on foreign
weapons sources, a mature local defense industry could also play a key
role in diversifying the Saudi economy while Riyadh is working to ease
its overreliance on energy exports. **[If the Saudi defense sector can
be successfully built out, it could provide jobs for a large number of
citizens and help address concerns about growing unemployment. Saudi
aspirations for an indigenous defense industry are certainly ambitious.
In its overarching Saudi Vision 2030 economic strategy, Riyadh wants to
produce locally at least half of the equipment it will need for security
and military use by 2030. To move toward that goal, when Saudi Arabia
negotiates major arms contracts with trade partners, it increasingly
insists that component manufacturing and final assembly be done in the
kingdom. Riyadh has also overhauled some parts of the government
structure to oversee the growth of its defense industry.]{.underline}**
For instance, the General Authority for Military Industries was created
in 2017 to coordinate weapons procurement and research and development
with an emphasis on local sourcing. In the same year, Saudi Arabian
Military Industries (SAMI), a state-owned defense company with a focus
on aeronautics, land weapons systems, missiles and defense electronics,
all areas of heavy Saudi need, was founded. SAMI\'s lofty goals include
the creation of more than 40,000 direct and 100,000 indirect jobs in the
country by 2030, which, by then, it hopes would add more than \$3.7
billion to the kingdom\'s annual gross domestic product, which stood at
about \$684 billion in 2017. **[Saudi Arabia already has made concrete
progress in building its defense industrial base. Large Western defense
companies employ thousands of Saudis at their plants in the kingdom.
Two-thirds of the workers employed by BAE Systems to assemble the Hawk
trainer jets it sold to Riyadh, for instance, are Saudi
citizens]{.underline}**. In March 2018, Boeing and SAMI formed a joint
venture partnership with the goal of localizing 55 percent of the
service and maintenance work done on Boeing aircraft sold to the kingdom
by 2030. According to Boeing, this would create 6,000 jobs or training
opportunities for Saudi youths.

### AT Perm - state da

#### The perm doesn't solve -- a complete destabilization of the bourgeois army is necessary for class revolution

**Walters and Heckman 1972** (David Walters and John Heckman;
transcriber and editor for the Prometheus Research Library; 9/1972;
"Proletarian Military Policy";
<https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/icl-spartacists/prs2-pmp/appx-pmp.html>)

The logic of the P.M.P. impelled the SWP to see the bourgeois army as
only one more arena of working-class struggle, like a factory, rather
than as the main coercive force of the bourgeois state**[. If Marxists
can favor trade-union control of industry, why not trade-union control
of military training?]{.underline}** We agree that Marxists seek to
fight oppression wherever it arises, including fighting for soldiers'
rights---but from this it does not follow that we should call for
"workers control of the army" as a parallel slogan to "workers control
of the factories**[." There will always be a need for development of the
forces of production; the proletarian revolution does not need to smash
them for its own purposes. The army's sole function is to maintain the
dominant class in power through coercion and repression;]{.underline}**
during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat**[, the
revolutionary state will have its own army, organized to serve its own
class purposes; a developed socialist society will have no need for this
special repressive apparatus, which will gradually dissolve into the
whole self-armed population, and then, like the state, it too will
wither away. The army is not a class-neutral institution.]{.underline}**
As part of the "special bodies of armed men" which constitute the basis
of the state, **[it cannot be a worker's army unless it is the army of a
worker's state.]{.underline}** Similarly, we do not delude the workers
with slogans of "workers control" of the police or of the prisons
either, since both are at the essence of the bourgeois state. If we
called for "workers control of the prisons," the blood of Attica would
be on our hands as well as Rockefeller's. The storming of the Bastille
represents the only possible form of "workers control" of the repressive
apparatus of the state---i.e., smashing it utterly. The P.M.P. was a
proposal for the unions to make the bourgeois army more democratic and
efficient to prosecute the war "against fascism." But the bourgeoisie
cannot fight fascism! The U.S. bourgeoisie wanted to fight the Germans
and Japanese to further its own imperialist goals, not to "fight
fascism." The P.M.P. error can be most clearly seen in the case of an
unpopular war: should we demand trade-union control of military training
in order to better fight in Vietnam? Obviously not. But the point is the
same. Only those social-chauvinists who support "their" government's war
aims can reasonably raise the P.M.P. As an SWP programmatic demand, the
P.M.P. never took life and shortly was shelved, because the SWP did
oppose the second imperialist war and therefore the autonomous
social-patriotic implications of the P.M.P. did not take hold. But
neither was the error corrected in those years, and it has been a source
of disorientation ever since for those young militants who seek to
counter pose en bloc the revolutionary SWP of the 1940s to the wretched
reformist vehicle which today still bears the initials SWP. **[The whole
authority of the state is based ultimately on its ability to
successfully employ its coercive power, which rests on its standing
army, police and prisons; the coercive power of the state is the very
essence of its structure. This development of state power is linked
directly to the development of class antagonisms, so that while the
state appears to stand above and outside of class conflict, as a
"neutral" third force, in reality it is nothing more than an agent of
the dominant, more powerful class in society.]{.underline}** These
considerations give rise to two major premises of revolutionary
strategy: (1) **[that the existing bourgeois state machinery, including
its army, must be crushed, and (2) in order to successfully accomplish
this, the bourgeois state must be unable to rely upon its own coercive
power; it must be unable to use it successfully against the
revolutionary forces who seek to fundamentally change the class
structure upon which the state rests. It is impossible to use the
bourgeois army for proletarian ends; it must be smashed. The
destabilizing of the bourgeois army, turning a section of it to the side
of the proletariat, is inseparably linked with, but not the same as, the
process of arming the proletariat.]{.underline}**

sources that are less energy efficient]{.underline}**." This applies to
all forms of energy. Producing usable energy ("exergy") to keep powering
"both basic and non-basic human activities" in industrial civilisation
"will require more, not less, effort." The amount of energy we can
extract, compared to the energy we are using to extract it, is
decreasing "across the spectrum --- unconventional oils, nuclear and
renewables return less energy in generation than conventional oils,
whose production has peaked --- and societies need to abandon fossil
fuels because of their impact on the climate," the paper states. **[The
shift to renewables might help solve the climate challenge, but for the
foreseeable future will not generate the same levels of energy as cheap,
conventional oil. In the meantime, our hunger for energy is driving what
the paper refers to as "sink costs." The greater our energy and material
use, the more waste we generate, and so the greater the environmental
costs. Though they can be ignored for a while, eventually those
environmental costs translate directly into economic costs as it becomes
more difficult to ignore their impacts on our societies. And the biggest
"sink cost," of course, is climate change: "Sink costs are also rising;
economies have used up the capacity of planetary ecosystems to handle
the waste generated by energy and material use. Climate change is the
most pronounced sink cost,]{.underline}**" the paper states. The paper's
lead author, Dr. Paavo Järvensivu, is a "biophysical economist" --- an
emerging type of economist exploring the role of energy and materials in
fuelling economic activity. The BIOS paper suggests that much of the
political and economic volatility we have seen in recent years has a
root cause in ecological crisis. As the ecological and economic costs of
industrial overconsumption continue to rise, the constant economic
growth we have become accustomed to is now in jeopardy. That, in turn,
has exerted massive strain on our politics. But the underlying issues
are still unacknowledged and unrecognised by most policymakers. **["We
live in an era of turmoil and profound change in the energetic and
material underpinnings of economies. The era of cheap energy is coming
to an end," the paper says. Conventional economic models, the Finnish
scientists note, "almost completely disregard the energetic and material
dimensions of the economy." "More expensive energy doesn't necessarily
lead to economic collapse,"]{.underline}** Järvensivu told me. "Of
course, people won't have the same consumption opportunities, there's
not enough cheap energy available for that, but they are not
automatically led to unemployment and misery either." The scientists
refer to the pioneering work of systems ecologist Professor Charles Hall
of the State University of New York with economist Professor Kent
Klitgaard from Wells College. Earlier this year, Hall and Klitgaard
released an updated edition of their seminal book, *Energy and the
Wealth of Nations: An Introduction to BioPhysical Economics*. Hall and
Klitgaard are highly critical of mainstream capitalist economic theory,
which they say has become divorced from some of the most fundamental
principles of science. They refer to the concept of 'Energy Return on
Investment' (EROI) as a key indicator of the shift into a new age of
difficult energy. EROI is a simple ratio that measures how much energy
we use to extract more energy. "For the last century, all we had to do
was to pump more and more oil out of the ground," say Hall and
Klitgaard. Decades ago, fossil fuels had very high EROI values --- a
little bit of energy allowed us to extract large amounts of oil, gas and
coal. But as I've previously reported for Motherboard, this is [no
longer the
case](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7pyb/welcome-to-the-age-of-crappy-oil).
Now **[we're using more and more energy to extract smaller quantities of
fossil fuels. Which means higher production costs to produce what we
need to keep the economy rolling. The stuff is still there in the
ground --- billions of barrels worth to be sure, easily enough to fry
the climate several times over. But it's harder and more expensive to
get out. And the environmental costs of doing so are rising
dramatically, as we've caught a glimpse of with this summer's [global
heatwave](https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/global-heatwave-is-symptom-of-early-stage-cycle-of-civilisational-collapse-efef3c1dd7eb).]{.underline}**
These costs are not recognised by capitalist markets. They literally
cannot be seen by prevailing economic models. Earlier in August,
billionaire investor Jeremy Grantham --- who has a track record of
consistently calling financial bubbles --- released an update to his
April 2013 analysis, 'The Race of Our Lives.' The [new
paper](https://www.gmo.com/docs/default-source/research-and-commentary/strategies/asset-allocation/the-race-of-our-lives-revisited.pdf),
'The Race of Our Lives Revisited,' provides a bruising indictment of
contemporary capitalism's complicity in the ecological crisis.
Grantham's verdict is that "capitalism and mainstream economics simply
cannot deal with these problems," namely, the systematic depletion of
planetary ecosystems and environmental resources: "The replacement cost
of the copper, phosphate, oil, and soil --- and so on --- that we use is
not even considered. If it were, it's likely that the last 10 or 20
years (for the developed world, anyway) has seen no true profit at all,
no increase in income, but the reverse," he wrote. Efforts to account
for these so-called 'externalities' by calculating their actual costs
have been well-meaning, but have had negligible impact on the actual
operation of capitalist markets. In short, according to Grantham, "**[we
face a form of capitalism that has hardened its focus to short-term
profit maximization with little or no apparent interest in social
good]{.underline}**." Yet for all his prescience and critical insights,
Grantham misses the most fundamental factor in the great unravelling in
which we now find ourselves: the transition to a low EROI future in
which we simply cannot extract the same levels of energy and material
surplus that we did decades ago.

#### Blueprints of the future aren't key -- we just need to prepare for the incoming collapse without clinging to failing solutions

**Ahmed 19** (Nafeez-Ahmed; British investigative journalist, author,
academic, change strategist, and editor of the journalism platform
INSURGE intelligence, 5/2/19, "Scientists Warn the UN of Capitalism's
Imminent Demise",
<https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-05-02/scientists-warn-the-un-of-capitalisms-imminent-demise/>)

**[Many experts believe we're moving past capitalism, but they disagree
on what the ultimate outcome will be. In]{.underline}** his book
*Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future,* British economics journalist
Paul Mason theorises that information technology is paving the way for
the emancipation of labour by reducing the costs of knowledge
production --- and potentially other kinds of production that will be
transformed by AI, blockchain, and so on --- to zero. **[Thus, he says,
will emerge a utopian 'postcapitalist' age of mass abundance, beyond the
price system and rules of capitalism. It sounds peachy, but Mason
completely ignores the colossal, exponentially increasing physical
infrastructure for the 'internet-of-things.' His digital uprising is
projected to [consume
evermore](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618301051)
vast quantities of energy (as much as [one-fifth of global
electricity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/tsunami-of-data-could-consume-fifth-global-electricity-by-2025)
by 2025), producing 14 percent of global carbon emissions by
2040.]{.underline}** Toward a new economic operating system. Most
observers, then, have no idea of the biophysical realities pointed out
in the background paper commissioned by the UN Secretary-General's
IGS --- that the driving force of the transition to postcapitalism is
the decline of what made 'endless growth capitalism' possible in the
first place: abundant, cheap energy. The UN's Global Sustainable
Development Report is being drafted by an independent group of
scientists (IGS) appointed by the UN Secretary-General. The IGS is
supported by a range of UN agencies including the UN Secretariat, the UN
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the UN Environment
Programme, the UN Development Programme, the UN Conference on Trade and
Development and the World Bank. The paper, co-authored by Dr Järvensivu
with the rest of the BIOS team, was commissioned by the UN's IGS
specifically to feed into the chapter on 'Transformation: the Economy.'
Invited background documents are used as the basis of the GSDR, but what
ends up in the final report will not be known until the final report is
released next year. Overall, the paper claims that we have moved into a
new, unpredictable and unprecedented space in which the conventional
economic toolbox has no answers. **[As slow economic growth simmers
along, central banks have resorted to negative interest rates and buying
up huge quantities of public debt to keep our economies
rolling.]{.underline}** But what happens after these measures are
exhausted? Governments and bankers are running out of options. **["It
can be safely said that no widely applicable economic models have been
developed specifically for the upcoming era," write the Finnish
scientists. Having identified the gap, they lay out the opportunities
for transition. In this low EROI future, we simply have to accept the
hard fact that we will not be able to sustain current levels of economic
growth.]{.underline}** "Meeting current or growing levels of energy need
in the next few decades with low-carbon solutions will be extremely
difficult, if not impossible," the paper finds. The economic transition
must involve efforts "to lower total energy use." Key areas to achieve
this include transport, food, and construction. City planning needs to
adapt to the promotion of walking and biking, a shift toward public
transport, as well as the electrification of transport. Homes and
workplaces will become more connected and localised. Meanwhile,
international freight transport and aviation cannot continue to grow at
current rates. As with transport, the global food system will need to be
overhauled. Climate change and oil-intensive agriculture have unearthed
the dangers of countries becoming dependent on food imports from a few
main production areas. A **[shift toward food self-sufficiency across
both poorer and richer countries will be essential. And ultimately,
dairy and meat should make way for largely plant-based diets. The
construction industry's focus on energy-intensive
manufacturing,]{.underline}** dominated by concrete and steel, should be
replaced by alternative materials. The BIOS paper recommends a return to
the use of long-lasting wood buildings, which can help to store carbon,
but other options such as
[biochar](https://media.chelseagreen.com/product/carbon-cascades/) might
be effective too. But capitalist markets will not be capable of
facilitating the required changes --- governments will need to step up,
and institutions will need to actively shape markets to fit the goals of
human survival. Right now, the prospects for this look slim. But the new
paper argues that either way, change is coming. Whether or not the
system that emerges still comprises a form of capitalism is ultimately a
semantic question. It depends on how you define capitalism. "Capitalism,
in that situation, is not like ours now," said Järvensivu. "**[Economic
activity is driven by meaning --- maintaining equal possibilities for
the good life while lowering emissions dramatically --- rather than
profit, and the meaning is politically, collectively constructed. Well,
I think this is the best conceivable case in terms of modern state and
market institutions. It can't happen without considerable reframing of
economic-political thinking, however."]{.underline}**

### Cap is Dead

#### It's not too late to cancel capitalism -- sustainable growth is an illusion destroying the lives of millions -- we must produce alternatives outside the system

**Monbiot 19** (George-Monbiot; British writer, environmental/political
activist, and columnist for the Guardian, 4/25/19, "Dare to declare
capitalism dead- before it takes us all down with it",
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/capitalism-economic-system-survival-earth>)

**[For most of my adult life I've railed against "corporate capitalism",
"consumer capitalism" and "crony capitalism". It took me a long time to
see that the problem is not the adjective but the nou]{.underline}**n.
While some people have rejected capitalism gladly and swiftly, I've done
so slowly and reluctantly. Part of the reason was that I could see no
clear alternative: unlike some anti-capitalists, I have never been an
enthusiast for state communism. I was also inhibited by its religious
status. **[To say "capitalism is failing" in the 21st century is like
saying "God is dead" in the 19th: it is secular blasphemy. It requires a
degree of self-confidence I did not possess. But as I've grown older,
I've come to recognise two things. First, that it is the system, rather
than any variant of the system, that drives us inexorably towards
disaster. Second, that you do not have to produce a definitive
alternative to say that capitalism is failing.]{.underline}** The
statement stands in its own right. But it also demands another, and
different, effort to develop a new system. Perpetual growth on a finite
planet leads inexorably to environmental calamity Capitalism's failures
arise from two of its defining elements. The first is [perpetual
growth](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/22/black-friday-consumption-killing-planet-growth).
Economic growth is the aggregate effect of the quest to accumulate
capital and extract profit. Capitalism collapses without growth, yet
perpetual growth on a finite planet leads inexorably to environmental
calamity. Those who defend capitalism argue that, as consumption
switches from goods to services, economic growth can be decoupled from
the use of material resources. Last week [a
paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13563467.2019.1598964?tokenDomain=eprints&tokenAccess=34DIKBKNXiFceff2QzRt&forwardService=showFullText&target=10.1080%2F13563467.2019.1598964&doi=10.1080%2F13563467.2019.1598964&doi=10.1080%2F13563467.2019.1598964&doi=10.1080%2F13563467.2019.1598964&journalCode=cnpe20&)
in the journal New Political Economy, by Jason Hickel and Giorgos
Kallis, examined this premise. They found that while some relative
decoupling took place in the 20th century (material resource consumption
grew, but not as quickly as economic growth), in the 21st century there
has been a recoupling: rising resource consumption has so far matched or
exceeded the rate of economic growth. The absolute decoupling needed to
avert environmental catastrophe (a reduction in material resource use)
has never been achieved, and appears impossible while economic growth
continues. Green growth is an illusion. **[A system based on perpetual
growth cannot function without peripheries and externalities. There must
always be an extraction zone -- from which materials are taken without
full payment -- and a disposal zone, where costs are dumped in the form
of waste and pollution. As the scale of economic activity increases
until capitalism affects everything, from the atmosphere to the deep
ocean floor, the entire planet becomes a sacrifice zone]{.underline}**:
**[we all inhabit the periphery of the profit-making machine. This
drives us towards cataclysm on such a scale that most people have no
means of imagining it. The threatened collapse of our life-support
systems is bigger by far than war, famine, pestilence or economic
crisis, though it is likely to incorporate all four]{.underline}**.
Societies can recover from these apocalyptic events, but not from the
[loss of
soil](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/25/treating-soil-like-dirt-fatal-mistake-human-life),
an abundant biosphere and a habitable climate. The second defining
element is the bizarre assumption that a person is entitled to as great
a share of the world's natural wealth [as their money can
buy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/capitalism-destroying-earth-human-right-climate-strike-children).
This seizure of common goods causes three further dislocations. First,
the scramble for exclusive control of non-reproducible assets, which
implies either violence or legislative truncations of other people's
rights. Second, the immiseration of other people by an economy based on
looting across both space and time. Third, the translation of economic
power into political power, as control over essential resources leads to
control over the social relations that surround them. In the New York
Times on Sunday, the [Nobel
economist](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2001/stiglitz/biographical/)
Joseph Stiglitz [sought to
distinguish](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/opinion/sunday/progressive-capitalism.html)
between good capitalism, which he called "wealth creation", and bad
capitalism, which he called "wealth grabbing" (extracting rent). I
understand his distinction. But from the environmental point of view,
wealth creation is wealth grabbing. Economic growth, intrinsically
linked to the increasing use of material resources, means seizing
natural wealth from both living systems and future generations. To point
to such problems is to invite a barrage of accusations, many of which
are based on this premise: capitalism has rescued hundreds of millions
of people from poverty -- [now you want to impoverish them
again](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/george-monbiot-and-the-climate-change-heart-of-darkness).
It is true that **[capitalism]{.underline}**, and the economic growth it
drives, has radically improved the prosperity of vast numbers of people,
while simultaneously **[destroying the prosperity of many]{.underline}**
others: **[those whose land, labour and resources were seized to fuel
growth elsewhere. Much of the wealth of the rich nations was -- and is
-- [built on slavery and colonial
expropriation](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/west-got-rich-modern-capitalism-born)]{.underline}**.
Like coal, **[capitalism]{.underline}** has brought many benefits. But,
like coal, it now **[causes more harm than good]{.underline}**. Just as
we have found means of generating useful energy that are better and less
damaging than coal, so we need to find means of generating human
wellbeing that are better and less damaging than capitalism. There is no
going back: the alternative to capitalism is neither feudalism nor state
communism. Soviet communism had more in common with
**[capitalism]{.underline}** than the advocates of either system would
care to admit. Both systems are (or were) obsessed with [generating
economic
growth](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/red-plenty-francis-spufford).
Both are willing to inflict astonishing levels of harm in pursuit of
this and other ends. Both promised a future in which we would need to
work for only a few hours a week, but instead **[demand endless, brutal
labour.]{.underline}** Both are dehumanising. Both are absolutist,
insisting that theirs and theirs alone is the one true God. So what does
a better system look like? I don't have a complete answer, and I don't
believe any one person does. But I think I see a rough framework
emerging. Part of it is provided by the ecological civilisation
[proposed by Jeremy
Lent](https://www.monbiot.com/2018/01/31/stepping-back-from-the-brink/),
one of the greatest thinkers of our age. Other elements come from [Kate
Raworth](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/08/doughnut-economics-by-kate-raworth-review)'s
[doughnut
economics](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/12/doughnut-growth-economics-book-economic-model)
and the environmental thinking of [Naomi
Klein](https://thischangeseverything.org/book/), [Amitav
Ghosh](https://www.amitavghosh.com/), [Angaangaq
Angakkorsuaq](https://icewisdom.com/), [Raj
Patel](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/green-new-deal-agriculture-farm-workers)
and [Bill
McKibben](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/23/stop-global-catastrophe-believe-humans-again-geoengineering).
Part of the answer lies in the notion of "[private sufficiency, public
luxury](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/labour-global-economy-planet)".
Another part arises from the creation of a new conception of justice
based on this [simple
principle](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/capitalism-destroying-earth-human-right-climate-strike-children):
every generation, everywhere, shall have an equal right to the enjoyment
of natural wealth. I believe our task is to identify the best proposals
from many different thinkers and shape them into a coherent alternative.
Because **[no economic system is only an economic system but intrudes
into every aspect of our lives, we need many minds from various
disciplines -- economic, environmental, political, cultural, social and
logistical -- working collaboratively to create a better way of
organising ourselves that meets our needs without destroying our home.
Our choice comes down to this. Do we stop life to allow capitalism to
continue, or stop capitalism to allow life to continue?]{.underline}**

### Cap unsus

#### Capitalism leads to climate disaster, oligarchy, and massive job loss due to automation; it's unsustainable

**Batchell 17** (John Batchell; in the Illinois Bureau of People\'s
world, served as national chair of the Communist Party USA from 2014 to
2019; 6/6/17; "Capitalism is destructive and unsustainable - It needs to
be replaced";
<https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/capitalism-is-destructive-and-unsustainable-it-needs-to-be-replaced>;
7/27/19)

[Several crises of contemporary capitalism have reached or are reaching
dangerous tipping points. They are rooted in a path of destructive and
unsustainable development]{.underline}. [They include extreme wealth and
social inequality, job loss and dislocation from automation, and the
existential threat posed by the ecological crisis]{.underline}. These
interconnected crises are impacting everything and must be addressed
together. And they can be. But standing in the way are Trump, the GOP
and extreme right, and their main support base: monopoly-finance
capital, the fossil fuel industry, and the military-industrial complex.
Their agenda is intensifying these crises and must be defeated. This
underscores the urgency to build the broadest resistance movement and
radically elevate the fight for unity of our multi-racial, male-female,
LGBTQ, immigrant and native-born working class and people. This is
central to guarantee the working class emerges as leader of the entire
movement to break the extreme right political stranglehold and open the
way for the challenging, contested, and complex transition to a just,
peaceful, eco-socialist society[. Planetary emergency Fossil fuels have
been the main energy source of capitalism since industrialization and a
prime source of profits]{.underline}. [Along with the drive for infinite
economic growth on a finite planet, this makes capitalism inherently
hostile to the Earth's ecology]{.underline}. "The rapidity with which
the human-caused positive \[climate\] forcing is being introduced [has
no known analog in Earth's history]{.underline}. It is thus exceedingly
difficult to foresee the consequences if the human-made climate forcing
continues to accelerate," say climate scientists James Hansen and Makiko
Sato[. The existential threat facing Earth must be addressed now. But
even with radical measures, the damage is already immense and will take
generations to reverse.]{.underline} [Capitalist market forces are
leading to the liquidation of the coal industry in favor of natural gas,
solar, wind, and geothermal -- all of which are cheaper and a new source
of profits.]{.underline} This is happening more rapidly than previously
estimated. The solar industry already employs twice as many workers as
the coal industry[. But capitalism, an inherently wasteful system, is
incapable of fully shedding fossil fuels, the massively inefficient and
polluting car culture, and other practices]{.underline}. A central
condition of any socialist transition is the complete elimination of
fossil fuels as an energy source. The "just transition" to clean energy,
demilitarization, and a universal health care system will cause massive
employment dislocation. However, transitioning to renewable energy,
retrofitting for energy conservation, and building a modern
infrastructure that also adapts to rising sea levels and extreme weather
events and expanding public healthcare, education, and culture will
create of millions of new jobs. Crisis of extreme wealth concentration
Monopolization, or more accurately, the formation of oligopolies, and
extreme wealth concentration is accelerating. [Capitalism, whose only
reason for existence is to maximize profits, is incapable of reversing
this process]{.underline}. The world's eight richest people own wealth
equal to the poorest half of the world's population. [In the U.S., the
top 1 percent own 35 percent of all wealth and the bottom 80 percent own
just 7 percent of the nation's wealth. We're really talking about the
top .1 percent -- an oligarchy]{.underline}. Extreme wealth
concentration is accompanied by a tendency toward permanent stagnation.
U.S. capitalist growth rates have declined from 3.5 percent in the 1960s
to 1 percent in the 2000s, although growth picked up after the Great
Recession. [Wealth concentration, wage suppression and attacks on
organized labor and interconnected.]{.underline} Despite rising
productivity, [wages have been flat or declined the past 40 years.
Income inequality based on race and gender is growing]{.underline}. [The
introduction of neoliberal policies in the 1970s was an attempt by
capitalists to overcome declining growth and profit rates by removing
obstacles to maximizing profits -- including globalized production,
privatization, and elimination of labor, health, and environmental
protections]{.underline}. Every crisis of capitalism has been
aggravated, including extreme levels of wealth concentration and the
ecological emergency. Financial speculation is another feature of
contemporary capitalism. With declining growth rates, external economic
stimulus is necessary in the form of consumer credit to create demand.
The results are credit "bubbles" and mammoth consumer debt. These
bubbles inevitably burst, like the 2008 "housing bubble," resulting in
devastating crises. Consumer debt, including for students and auto
loans, is reaching pre-2008 levels. Any large-scale infrastructure works
and green transition will require massive wealth redistribution,
including substantial wage increases, immense public investment, and
reorienting federal budget priorities. Trade, automation, and job loss A
debate is taking place over whether unemployment due to automation --
and specifically robots -- distinct from cyclical and structural
unemployment, is growing. Many are warning of massive job losses from
accelerating introduction of robots, although a new EPI report
challenges this idea. Robots assemble cars at an automobile
manufacturing facility in Tianjin. \| China Daily Capitalism is marked
by the constant revolutionizing of the means of production. In 1800, the
agricultural labor force made up 80 percent of total employment in the
U.S. Today it is less than 2 percent. In 1960, the manufacturing sector
made up 25 percent of total employment. In 2014, it was 8.8 percent. The
revolution based on digital technology has facilitated capitalist
globalization, increased productivity, and economic dislocation. Global
supply chains, just-in-time production, the gig economy, and the shift
to the service sector increasingly characterize present-day capitalism.
Approximately 40 percent of the workforce is composed of contingent
workers, i.e. temp agencies, on-call, contract workers, independent
contractors, the self-employed, and involuntary part-time (6.6 million).
Unfair trade agreements, shifting transnational corporate investments,
and outsourcing to global low-wage zones have harshly impacted U.S.
manufacturing employment. It is estimated NAFTA resulted in the loss of
1 million jobs in the U.S. and another 1.3 million among Mexican
farmers, precipitating the surge in immigration. Approximately 1 million
jobs were lost from transnational corporate outsourcing to China between
2000-2007, after it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). This was
offset by domestic job creation mainly in the low-wage service sector.
More than 80 percent of private sector employment is now in service
jobs. These trade pacts have driven a race to the bottom in wages,
health and safety, and environmental protections. U.S., Mexican, and
Canadian workers have all suffered. These agreements should be
renegotiated to impose global standards for wages, labor, health and
safety, and environmental protections, and restore national sovereignty
and the authority of democratic institutions. But unfair free trade
pacts don't tell the entire story. Obscured in all this, including by
Trump's economic nationalism, right-wing populism, and racist
scapegoating, is the ongoing impact of automation. In the past 20 years,
a span that includes NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO, U.S.
manufacturing output has increased 40 percent. [U.S. workers are being
exploited more than ever. "America has lost more than 7 million factory
jobs since manufacturing employment peaked in 1979. Yet American factory
production...more than doubled over the same span...(in
2015),"]{.underline} reported the New Haven Register. "(A Ball State
study)...found that trade accounted for just 13 percent of America's
lost factory jobs. [The vast majority of the lost jobs -- 88 percent --
were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that
reduce...labor]{.underline}." The Obama Administration projected 47
percent of U.S. jobs would be at risk of elimination due to automation
by 2025. If these forecasts are accurate, [automation will create
economic dislocation and loss of jobs on a scale not seen before,
including 5.1 million over the next five years. Over the next decade, it
is estimated 1.7 million trucker jobs will be eliminated. Sales,
customer service, transportation, medical/ healthcare, and the legal
fields will be most impacted]{.underline}. Loss of coal mining jobs is
not due to a "war on coal," as Trump would have us believe, but rather
to lower natural gas prices and greater automation. Between 1980 and
2015, the coal industry shed 59 percent of mining jobs but production
grew 8 percent. New technology and modern production methods are
responsible for major job losses in the steel and metals industry. Since
1997, 42 percent of jobs have been eliminated while production grew 38
percent. The construction trades won't escape automation, either. A
union pipefitter friend told me about new technology that eliminates
pipe welders. Five hundred thousand construction jobs will be lost in
the next five years due to automation. Some outsourced industries are
beginning to return to the U.S., like the textile industry. But they are
globally competitive on the basis of automation, not wages. In the past,
technological advances have decimated employment in some industries but
given rise to employment in new ones, changing the composition of the
workforce. What's different this time, according to some observers, is
artificial intelligence, which is being applied to visual and voice
recognition. Computers can now "think and learn" without humans.
Factories already exist where production never touches human hands.
[While automation creates crises for capitalism, it also creates the
material conditions for socialism, a society based on putting the needs
of people first.]{.underline} Permanent underemployment Long-term
unemployment is growing. The official unemployment rate is under 5
percent, but the non-participation rate is now close to 40 percent.
Nearly 95 million Americans don't participate in the production process.
Average monthly job growth is not keeping up with population growth. One
estimate claims that one-third of men aged 25-54 will be out of work by
2050. U[nemployment carries a racist edge as well and is nearly
generational among African American, Latino, and Native American youth.
Areas of deep poverty also exist among whites in rural regions. Clearly,
long-term joblessness is a growing crisis for capitalism and is being
exacerbated by globalization, wage suppression and
automation.]{.underline} Expanding democracy for a sustainable
transition and modern infrastructure Any massive and rapid change in
structural employment is fertile soil for extreme right-wing demagogues.
This danger can be addressed by advocating a bold vision for economic
and social security inclusive of all workers and their communities. Any
proposal to rebuild the nation's infrastructure will be an arena of mass
struggle, with competing class and social interests. Trump's
infrastructure proposal is geared to repairing a 20th century
infrastructure based on fossil fuels and enriching wealthy contractors
and investors. He is banking on the working class footing the bill while
splitting labor to build a loyal base among the building trades. The
American Society of Civil Engineers has called for a \$2 trillion
project. The AFL-CIO supported Trump's original call for a \$1 trillion
investment, with certain conditions. Broad-based unity can be built
around a modern infrastructure act and a just transition to a
sustainable economy that will create millions of jobs with union wages
and protections, address social inequality, and restore and expand basic
democratic rights. Demands arising from the Fight for \$15, racial
justice, climate justice, reproductive justice, LGBTQ, immigrant rights,
and other mass movements are forming the programmatic basis for unity.
Intersectionality and solidarity is growing between movements in the
current upsurge against Trump. For example, the jobs and environmental
crises are being interlinked and addressed by the Blue-Green Alliance
and the Labor Network for Sustainability, environmental justice, civil
rights, and other movements. This is the basis to unite our multi-racial
working class, overcome current divisions within labor and between
sections of labor and the environmental movement.

### AT: Cap Solves biodiversity

#### Global capitalism has destroyed biodiversity -- a majority of the planet has been significantly altered and millions of species are headed for extinction.

**Schlanger 19** (Zoë-Schlanger; reporter covering science, health and
the environment, 5/6/19, "A million plant and animal species are going
extinct- and capitalism is to blame",
<https://qz.com/1612943/un-biodiversity-report-says-a-million-species-face-extinction/>"

**[Global capitalism is, indeed, destroying the Earth. A blockbuster UN
report on global biodiversity details how economic systems are driving a
million species toward extinction---and imperiling the survival of
humanity. The crux of the
[report](https://www.ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment) is
that incessant economic growth is fundamentally at odds with the
survival of life. Its 40-page "[summary for
policymakers](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yd8l2v0u4jqptp3/AACpraYjOYWpTxAFv5H-2vrKa/1%20Global%20Assessment%20Summary%20for%20Policymakers?dl=0&preview=Summary+for+Policymakers+IPBES+Global+Assessment.pdf&subfolder_nav_tracking=1)"
(pdf) is riddled with examples of why this is so, and one line searingly
sums it up: Economic instruments that may be harmful to nature include
subsidies, financial transfers, subsidized credit, tax abatements,
commodity and industrial goods prices that hide environmental and social
costs, which favor unsustainable production and, as a consequence, can
promote deforestation, overfishing, urban sprawl, and wasteful uses of
wate]{.underline}**r. The complete Intergovernmental Science-Policy
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report, written
by 400 scientists, is to be released later this year. It will be hefty:
A draft of the report [leaked to some
press](https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/how-fix-nature-and-avoid-human-misery-un-report-doc-1g510c2)
last week was 1,800 pages long. Our economic system currently ignores
the many ways that natural systems prop up the generation of food and
wealth. Simultaneously, our economic systems are killing off swaths of
the natural world. The complete disregard of those natural systems is
possible mainly because the economic benefit of "ecosystem services"
nature provides is not included in our calculations of the cost of doing
business. What is lost, economically, from destroying nature is missing
from balance sheets. Eventually the losses will bring the system
crashing down, the summary implies. Take bees, for example: Pollinators
like bees provide a massive, free service to the food economy. They are
responsible for 75% of crop cultivation each year. **[Climate change,
chemical use, habitat destruction, and the homogenization of food crops
from many species to just a few are all causing cataclysmic pollinator
declines. Without them, food systems will eventually
fail]{.underline}**. Our economic math is all wrong: The value of global
agricultural crop production has increased by about 300% since 1970,
according to the report. But modern practices like fertilization and
monocultures degrade soils. Globally, that has reduced the productivity
of 23% of Earth's land surface, putting as much as \$577 billion in
annual global crop value at risk from pollinator loss. The report
calculates that annual global fossil-fuel subsidies from governments of
\$345 billion actually result in global costs of \$5 trillion, when one
includes the role fuel extraction plays in reducing nature's
contributions to the world economy. (Half those costs are related to
coal, a third to oil, and a tenth to natural gas, per the report.) When
nature is counted as a legitimate entity propping up much of the
economy, the losses are astounding. Thanks to our interdependence with
the natural world, its decline is our decline. Human activity has
touched virtually every system on Earth. **[Around 75% of land and 66%
of oceans have been "significantly altered,"]{.underline}** according to
the report summary. Much of that is due to agriculture. A **[quarter of
all ice-free land on Earth is used to graze cattle. In total, crop and
livestock operations use more than 33% of land surface and 75% of its
fresh water. One million species are headed for extinction, "many within
decades," according to the report. Unless dramatic action is taken, 40%
of amphibian species, one-third of marine mammals and one-third of
reef-forming corals will disappear. More than 500,000 land species that
no longer have enough habitat left to survive long-term will go extinct
unless habitats are restored. The worldwide raw-timber harvest, which
drives deforestation and habitat loss, has risen by 45% since 1970,
according to the report.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, urban areas have more
than doubled since 1992. A third of all marine fish stocks were
overharvested in 2015; another 60% were fished at the maximum
sustainable level. Just 7% were harvested at levels lower than the
maximum. **[The global plastic pollution crisis ravaging marine species
has increased tenfold since 1980. Humans are dumping as much as 400
million tons of toxic sludge---containing heavy metals, solvents, and
other industrial waste---into the world's waters each year. Agricultural
fertilizers running off farmland and into waterways have transformed 400
ocean areas totaling area larger than the UK into "dead zones" devoid of
enough oxygen to support marine life. The Earth is set to continue down
a path of life-imperiling destruction barring "transformative change,"
according to the report. That "transformative change" must clearly take
place in the way that the human economy values---or, rather,
devalues---nature]{.underline}**.

### AT: Cap Solves Climate

#### Capitalism structure climate change -- the relation to nature as an infinite resource is unsustainable -- the effects of collapse are all around us.

**Noor 19** (Dharna-Noor; climate journalist and producer at the Real
News Network, 6/15/19, "Socialism or Extinction",
https://jacobinmag.com/2019/06/biodiversity-species-extinction-united-nations-report")

**[A new report says that human action is driving one million plant and
animal species to extinction. But it's not just any human action: it's
the choices of a tiny minority of wealthy and powerful people. Human
action is driving some one million plant and animal species to
annihilation, according to the most comprehensive
[assessment](https://www.ipbes.net/system/tdf/spm_americas_2018_digital.pdf?file=1&type=node&id=28393)
ever conducted on life on Earth. Extinction now threatens a quarter of
all of Earth's species --- and that estimate is
[conservative](https://www.ipbes.net/news/how-did-ipbes-estimate-1-million-species-risk-extinction-globalassessment-report).
That includes the kind of beloved megafauna that are the subjects of
traditional conservation efforts. Tigers, for instance, are now
[absent](https://www.panthera.org/cat/tiger) from 96 percent of their
historic territory. But over 40 percent of amphibian species, one-third
of all reef-forming corals, one-third of all marine mammal species, and
10 percent of insect species face extinction]{.underline}**, too, says
the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity on Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report summary for
policymakers. Most extinctions go unnoticed. It can take years for
scientists to learn that a plant or creature is gone forever. But the
consequences of an extinction can be complex. Like a game of Jenga, when
one piece is removed, the whole structure is compromised, and
eventually, the entire ecosystem can collapse. This isn't just a moral
issue. Biodiversity loss also poses an existential threat to humanity
--- one the IPBES says is as massive as the climate crisis . We are
already losing the insects that we depend on to pollinate our crops, and
the forests that protect millions of people from flooding and that
sequester carbon. And yet, the summary says, we are ramping up our death
cult-like behavior. We keep over-farming, over-logging, over-fishing,
mining, [extracting fossil
fuels](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/fossil-fuels-climate-change-crimes-against-humanity),
and emitting greenhouse gases**[. But all of humanity isn't responsible
for this ecological collapse. In fact, the very activity that fuels it
has been disastrous for billions of people. This mass extinction crisis,
the report shows, is fueled by an economic system that prioritizes the
growth of profits above all else. In an effort to outcompete their
rivals and maximize profits, corporations exploit human and nonhuman
life by suppressing wages and externalizing social and environmental
costs, depleting the ecosystems and societies on which life depends.
"Nature, the wonderfully abundant and diverse wild life of the world, is
essentially a free pool of goods and labor that capital can draw
on]{.underline}**," Ashley Dawson wrote in Extinction: A Radical
History. In an effort to expand at an ever-increasing rate, he says,
capital commodifies more of the Earth, "stripping the world of its
diversity and fecundity." The chief culprit of biodiversity loss is
"changes in land and sea use." Three-quarters of the world's land and
nearly three-quarters of the world's freshwater resources are now
devoted to crop or livestock production, says the IPBES. Industrial
agriculture wreaks havoc on ecosystems in many ways. Plants and animals
are displaced and killed to make room for farms; monocultural practices
and pesticides disrupt soil microbes and endanger insects and plants;
water is pumped in from lakes and rivers, disrupting aquatic life.
[Agribusiness](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/green-new-deal-agriculture-farm-workers)
defends these practices in the name of eradicating world hunger. Global
crop yields have
[increased](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/crop-yields-increase)
in recent decades, but its gains have come at a cost to many people, and
globally, nearly [one in
nine](https://www.foodaidfoundation.org/world-hunger-statistics.html)
people are still undernourished. This is felt most harshly in poor
nations in the Global South. Two-thirds of people in Asia are hungry,
and in "developing countries," one in six children are underweight,
[according to](https://www1.wfp.org/zero-hunger) the World Food
Programme. Meanwhile, farm subsidies for commodity crops like corn and
soybeans have created an enormous market for cheap, processed junk foods
that can raise cholesterol and increase risk of diabetes. Agricultural
corporations claim to maximize efficiency. But [more than a
third](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/feeding-9-billion/)
of the world's crops go to livestock, even though prioritizing growing
crops for human consumption could feed
[billions](http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/dtix1262xpa-priorityproductsandmaterials_report.pdf)
of hungry people. Industrial livestock farming is the world's biggest
user of land resources. It produces vast quantities of manure --- some
500 million tons from the US alone --- that pollutes the air with
chemicals like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, and runs off into nearby
waterways, contributing to [algae
blooms](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms)
which can make drinking water
[toxic](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-human-health) for
animals and people. **[For workers, this pollution compounds with other
threats: American meat workers' risk of serious injury is three times
higher than the national average. Contemporary global agribusiness is
controlled by just
[four](https://seedworld.com/from-big-six-to-big-four/) major
agricultural biotechnology companies. To assert control over the global
seed supply chain and ensure maximum yields, these companies strictly
limit what can be planted by enforcing monocultural
practices.]{.underline}** But because monocultures are vulnerable to
disease, they rely on herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizers that
have been linked to cancer and other diseases. The resulting system has
been devastating for biodiversity. While agribusiness profits have
soared, farmers' income has
[dropped](https://modernfarmer.com/2019/05/farmer-income-drops-at-largest-rate-in-three-years/).
By raising the prices on seeds, fertilizer, and other products,
corporations trap farmers in debt that they are forced to pay off by
selling their yields. The creation of "terminator seeds" that make
second-generation seeds sterile exacerbates this. This cycle has sparked
a long wave of [farmer
suicides](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-suicides-unabated-in-punjab-over-900-in-2-years/727671.html)
in northern India. Farmers in the United States, where
[increasingly](https://newfoodeconomy.org/who-really-owns-american-farmland/)
powerful agricultural corporations are buying up more American farms and
suppressing the prices paid to family farmers, face a similar plight.
"Direct exploitation of organisms" through practices like commercial
logging and fishing is another major driver of biodiversity loss,
according to the IPBES. These practices destroy critical habitats and
disrupt food chains. As a result,
[plants](http://www.rainforestconservation.org/rainforest-primer/3-rainforests-in-peril-deforestation/f-consequences-of-deforestation/3-loss-of-biodiversity-including-genetic-diversity/)
and
[animals](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/mexico-porpoise-extinction.html)
that were once common are now endangered. But the report says these
practices are on the rise: the world's raw timber harvest has increased
by 45 percent since 1970, and 55 percent of the world's oceans are
covered by industrial fishing. These practices also exploit people. The
forestry industry displaces indigenous people from the United States to
[Cameroon](https://intercontinentalcry.org/palm-oil-project-in-cameroon-continues-producing-opposition-20171/)
to
[Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/02/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-amazon-rainforest-protections).
Commercial fishing, too, threatens global indigenous populations who
[depend on fish for
food](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/02/coastal-native-people-who-need-fish-the-most-are-losing-them/?utm_term=.0144edb8c328).
And in the United States, logging and fishing are also among the most
dangerous industries for workers. The federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics' [Census of Fatal Occupational
Injuries](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf) found that they
were the two deadliest industries in 2019. For every 100,000 workers,
the logging industry saw 135.9 deaths on the job, and commercial fishing
saw 86 deaths. Globally, working conditions are even worse. Thailand's
fisheries, from where much of the United States' pet and livestock feed
is sourced, continue to [literally
enslave](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html)
migrants from Cambodia and Myanmar. As fishing stocks have depleted and
maritime labor laws have been dismantled in recent years, the industry
has
[reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html)
enslaved more people. And it's not just Thai fisheries. Reports
[have](https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-slavery/more-than-300-brazilian-companies-busted-for-modern-day-slavery-campaigners-idUSL8N15U3CD)[found](https://www.cptnacional.org.br/index.php/component/jdownloads/download/25-cartilhas/14037-por-debaixo-da-floresta-amazonia-paraense-saqueada-com-trabalho-escravo)
that Brazil's timber industry holds workers hostage in logging camps and
forces them to perform life-threatening labor. The IPBES says the
third-biggest driver of the biodiversity crisis is climate change, which
is inextricable from the other culprits. **[Industrial agriculture is
responsible for [13
percent](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data)
of global carbon emissions, making it the second-largest emitter behind
the energy sector. Logging has a massive impact on climate change, too,
not only because forests actively sequester carbon, but also because
incinerating logged trees to generate energy, a practice known as "woody
biomass," emits [even more
CO2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa512/pdf)
than burning coal. Climate disruption, an existential crisis in its own
right, is already having an impact on biodiversity. The changing
temperature of the atmosphere and oceans "will be accompanied by changes
in glacial extent, rainfall, river discharge, wind and ocean currents
and sea level, among many other environmental features, which, on
balance, have had adverse impacts on biodiversity," says the IPBES. The
[climate crisis](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/if-we-fail), like
biodiversity loss, is not everyone's fault. Over 70 percent of carbon
emissions come from just [100
companies](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240).
What's more, the countries that contribute the
[least](https://skepticalscience.com/co2-limits-poor-poverty.htm) to
global climate change are by and large the most affected by the
devastation it causes]{.underline}**. Though the impacts can be seen
around the world, the poor and Global South are getting hit first and
hardest. When Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi this
March, it killed a thousand people, and thousands more are still
missing. It was one of the worst cyclones on record, and it [wasn't an
aberration](https://qz.com/africa/1615280/indian-ocean-is-spawning-deadlier-tropical-cyclones-like-idai/).
As the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
headline-grabbing report on the effects of reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius
of warming above preindustrial levels (and countless other climate
reports) show, if we don't make radical changes, things will get much
worse. Like the IPCC's 2018 report, the IPBES has a clear message for
policymakers. To avert catastrophe, the world must undergo a
"fundamental, system-wide reorganization across technological, economic
and social factors, including paradigms, goals and values,"
[said](https://www.ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment) IPBES
chair Sir Robert Watson. In many ways, we're on the wrong track. Global
carbon levels are reaching [all-time
highs](https://www.livescience.com/65469-highest-carbon-dioxide-levels.html).
The Trump administration is trying to
[dismantle](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/endangered-species-act-conservation-pombo-privatization)
the [Endangered Species
Act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2018/07/19/endangered-species-act-stripped-of-key-provisions-in-trump-administration-proposal/?utm_term=.971ea3eae0fd),
will no longer enforce
[protections](https://truthout.org/articles/the-trump-administration-has-thrown-out-protections-for-migratory-birds/)
for birds killed unintentionally by corporate activity, and is
dismantling
[dozens](http://www.environmentalintegrity.org/trump-watch-epa/regulatory-rollbacks/)
of environmental protections on air and water pollution. The report
summary is full of grim news, too. Environmental degradation has reduced
the productivity of 23 percent of the Earth's land. Pollinator loss is
putting some \$577 billion of annual global crops at risk. Hundreds of
millions of people are at increased risk of floods and storms because of
degraded coastal habitats. Since 1980, plastic pollution has increased
tenfold. A shocking 85 percent of global wetlands have been destroyed.
And because of all this, the world is already in the midst of its sixth
major extinction period. Extinctions are happening at [1,000
times](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/)
their natural speed, with dozens of species lost each day. The IPBES
advocates for specific policies that could curb mass extinction,
including reversing the expansion of monoculture and taking up a
localized approach to farming, creating marine reserves and reducing
pollution and runoff, and restoring sovereignty to indigenous
populations, whose lands have seen slower biodiversity decline. Most
importantly, the report concludes, global society must stop prioritizing
growth for profit, and instead construct an economy that serves the
needs of people and the planet. This political shift could protect
countless human and nonhuman lives from the existential threat of
ecological collapse --- and its drivers. "By fecklessly consuming the
environment, capital is figuratively sawing off the tree branch it is
sitting on," wrote author Ashley Dawson. "Capital's logic is therefore
that of a cancer cell, growing uncontrollably until it destroys the body
that hosts it." This transformation won't be easy, but IPBES chair
Watson is optimistic. "By its very nature, transformative change can
expect opposition from those with interests vested in the status quo,
but also that such opposition can be overcome for the broader public
good," he said. If we're going to survive, we have no choice but to
succeed.

## Race Module

### Alt Turns Race Movements/Teleos/demands Good

#### Demands by black activists are critical to producing change and organizing the working class -- anticapitalist prescriptions are essential to resurrecting the history of communists of color to the function of liberatory movements.

**Williams '15** (Douglas, third-generation organizer, having a
grandmother who worked to integrate the schools in his hometown and a
father who continues to be active in labor organizing, "BLACK LIVES
MATTER AND THE FAILURE TO BUILD A MOVEMENT."
http://thesouthlawn.org/2015/08/10/black-lives-matter-and-the-failure-to-build-a-movement/)

**[As]{.underline}** the famous quote from **[Frederick
Douglass]{.underline}** should **[remind]{.underline}** all of **[us,
"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never
will."]{.underline}** **[In the absence of any ideological mooring
or]{.underline}** any, you know, **[actual demands beyond getting
candidates to say a hashtag, it is hard to see how Black Lives Matter
actually envisions a society that is different from the one we have
now.]{.underline}** Perhaps that is by design, given Garza's answer to
the question of abolishing the police in an interview for The Nation:
"THE POINT TO ME IS TO BE ABLE TO DIG INTO THESE QUESTIONS AS OPPOSED TO
BEING PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE." The problem, of course,
is that **[it is hard to build a movement around fighting white
supremacy and institutional racism when you are circumspect about a
definitive path to eliminating those social ills; people typically want
to know what your endgame is before they support your
cause.]{.underline}** How are you going to end white supremacy or
institutional racism? **[Is it over once every cop is fitted with body
cameras?]{.underline}** Do we win when cops go to jail for civil rights
violations? **[What if those things happen while unemployment for the
Black working class is more than double the white working
class?]{.underline}** Is that not white supremacy, too? **[Prescriptions
are a good thing.]{.underline}** **[Otherwise a social movement becomes
what Black Lives Matter has seemingly become: a vehicle for individuals
to become celebrity activists, feted by major media and nonprofits
across the United States.]{.underline}** **[How many articles have you
seen that were focused on individual activists affiliated with Black
Lives Matter?]{.underline}** **[How many articles have you seen about
policy victories at the local, state, or national levels?]{.underline}**
Compare the two in your mind and see what you come up with. It is far
more likely that you will remember some activist's profile before you
can think of a story on any kind of significant change that has affected
Black Lives for the better. Great for them, I suppose, but then **[what
has all of this been for if we are not working to remake the
relationship between the state and its citizens?]{.underline}** **[Given
the police's role as the main defender of private property in a
capitalist system, we need something more visionary than a few hashtags
and beige liberalism carefully disguised as radical
change.]{.underline}** --- This has been a summer of disappointment. Not
just with Black Lives Matter, but with **[self-described socialist
organizations]{.underline}** and publications that **[seem to believe
that pandering to this particular protest group will get
people]{.underline}** like Alicia Garza and the innumerable online
personalities who parrot similar rhetoric **[to stop engaging in the
worst kind of hypocritical red-baiting]{.underline}**: a red-baiting
**[that completely erases socialists and communists of color from
history in order to serve their mangled versions of liberatory
politics.]{.underline}** As I have told people privately and publicly on
a regular basis, **[their efforts will do nothing more than embolden an
exclusive and identity-based liberalism.]{.underline}** And you know
what? The Sanders campaign posted about the #SayHerName hashtag all over
social media. The largest socialist organization in America has posted
on their blog and on social media in support of Black Lives Matter in
the wake of their last demonstration at Netroots Nation in Phoenix.
Guess what? We are still here, with Black Lives Matter activists
denouncing people at a rally for programs supported by Black people by a
9-to-1 margin as "white supremacists", and with people from the online
social justice set calling them "white moderates". Funny how that works
out. --- It has been painful to see Black Lives Matter go all catawompus
the way that it has. **[When the protests in Ferguson first began, I
thought that this might be the best chance for a transformative and
revolutionary change]{.underline}** in our communities since King was
rallying Black people and progressives of all stripes across the United
States to a vision of liberation and justice. But it seems that all of
**[this potential is being squandered so that a few people bent on the
empty satisfaction of moral rectitude can score their fifteen minutes of
fame.]{.underline}** I have little faith that this will rectify itself
in a world where the intoxication of fame and adulation is just one
hashtag or attention-grabbing moment away.

### AT: Cap doesn't explain anti-black slavery

#### Capitalist ideology structure the exceptional nature of antiblack slavery -- the ethical contradictions of capitalism require writing the slave outside of the category of humanity.

Science at York University, "Ellen Meiksins Wood: Empire in the Age of

In capitalist markets, where **[labor is exchanged in the market without

equal]{.underline}**. What impact did the identification of capitalism
with freedom and equality have on **[the rationale for subordinating
certain people as slaves]{.underline}**? The first point obviously is
that **[even though capitalism is conventionally defined in terms of
wage labor, that didn't prevent it from making use of slave labor at
certain moments in its history]{.underline}**. There's a lot to be said
about how **[capitalism has exploited slavery and, conversely, how
slavery was shaped by capitalist imperatives, which didn't exist in
earlier forms of slavery. I think that it's possible to argue that the
extreme racism that was associated with slavery in the United States, an
extreme kind of racism that didn't exist in the same way in ancient
slave societies, has to do partly with the fact that the ideology of
capitalism]{.underline}**, **[which argues that all human beings are

people were transparently not legally equal]{.underline}**. And so
**[one justification for this anomaly was simply to write a whole

## Settler Colonialism Module

### AT: Essentialism

#### The broad categorization of settler colonial theory flattens out the differences and particularities that class produces in the formation of Israeli/plaestine social relations -- history proves that they can't win an essentialism DA against the alternative.

**Locker-Biletzki 2018 (**Amir, post-doc @ Concordia University,
"Rethinking Settler Colonialism: A Marxist Critique of Gershon Shafir",
Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

The same critical view is voiced by the Australian sociologist Rachel
Busbridge (2017, 2, 18). She acknowledges that "**[settler
colonialism]{.underline}** as an interpretive paradigm holds powerful
conceptual and pedagogical implications for reframing understandings of
the conflict in Israel-Palestine." At the same time, like other critics
she points to its "**[contextual point of origin flattening out
important local historical and socio-political
specificities."]{.underline}** She finds **[the reason for this limited
aspect of the paradigm in "the settler colonial paradigm's insistence on
an ontology of absolute polarity of settler and Native."]{.underline}**
**[This rigidness of settler-colonial theory prevents it from fully
acknowledging "the role of nationalism" in the dynamics of the Zionist-
Palestinian conflict.]{.underline}** Like many of the scholars presented
here, this essay acknowledges the value and validity of the
settler-colonialism concept. At the same time, the broad brush with
which it paints varied settler-colonial experiences is reinterpreted by
this essay as a lack of understanding of the role that class and capital
play in the case of Palestine/ Israel. To date, as far as I am aware, a
Marxist critique of the settler-colonial concept has not been attempted.
Marxian thinking is vaguely implicit in settler-colonial theories and in
their application to Palestine/Israel. Lorenzo Veracini (2010, 1) finds
one of the origins of settler-colonial discourse in the 1848 Communist
Manifesto, in "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' remark that the 'need of
a constantly expanding market for its product chases the bourgeoisie
over the whole surface of the globe,' and that it 'must nestle
everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.'" At
the same time, Veracini and Wolfe argue against the presence of class
conflicts and the extraction of value from the land when this is in
itself a form of capital and a means of creating it that the settlers
crave. **[The Marxian element is evident in the origins of
settler-colonial discourse on Zionism.]{.underline}** As a way to
describe Zionist settlements in Palestine, the concept of colonialism
has long been used by Palestinian and Jewish anti-Zionist
intellectuals.2 However, one of the first manifestations of an
understanding of the colonial logic of Zionism can be found in the work
of the French Jewish Marxist Orientalist Maxime
**[Rodinson]{.underline}** (1973). He **[argues that European Jews that
opted for Zionism in the nineteenth century]{.underline}**---motivated
by escaping antisemitism--- **[sought the help of the imperial powers
(mainly Britain) in order to overcome Palestinian resistance and effect
Zionist settlement.]{.underline}** **[This Marxist explanation
is]{.underline}** for him **[the "one case where Marxist theorizing has
come forward with the clearest response to the requirements of the
'implicit ideology' of the Third World"]{.underline}** (27). Thus, for
Rodinson the imperial-colonial nexus was only made explicit through
Marxism. At the same time, Rodinson's portrayal does not include a
detailed account of Zionist colonial practice---concerning land and
labor---and mainly associates Zionism with Western imperialism. His
rendition of the colonial process in Palestine/Israel does not include a
depiction of class and capitalist dynamics within Palestinian and
Jewish-Israeli societies. Zionist settlement and disinheritance
practices have also been the subject of analysis by Palestinian Marxist
intellectuals. In his 1976 essay "Imperialism and Settler Colonialism in
West Asia: Israel and the Arab Palestinian Struggle," Palestinian
Marxist sociologist Jamil Hilal (1976, 52) starts from a similar point
as Rodinson. **[Zionism is organically linked to the Western imperial
project, and "since Zionism has no social base in Palestine, the Zionist
movement had to ally itself with the imperialist powers. It approached
and offered to serve the interests of the Ottoman rulers, German, French
and British imperialism."]{.underline}** However, in contrast to
Rodinson**[, Hilal is more aware of the colonizing practices of Zionism:
"Zionists strove not to exploit the indigenous Palestinian population
but to displace it"]{.underline}** (53). In contrast to the capitalist
colonialism of South Africa and its seeking to exploit black labor,
Zionism had no economic use for Palestinians. **[Despite the fact that
Hilal allows elements that do not square with Marxist dogma, such as the
absence of economic exploitation of native labor power, he keeps his
perspective resolutely within the Marxist tradition.]{.underline}** This
element is obvious when he describes historical class formation.
**[Zionism, he states, "pledged to create a fullyfledged class society
of Jewish settlers]{.underline}** (i.e., a Jewish working class)" (53).
**[Palestinians developed a class society made from a mixture of
peasants and the landlord class as well as a nascent bourgeoisie and a
radicalized working class:]{.underline}** "The nascent but thwarted Arab
bourgeoisie, the landlords fearful of Zionist competition and expansion,
the peasantry who were becoming increasingly pauperized, the radicalized
working class (a strong Arab communist party emerged in Palestine with
the emergence of a working class there, mostly employed in the ports and
railways of Palestine)" (54).

### AT: Marx is Anti-semetic

#### Marx Isn't anti-semitic -- Marx wrote in defense of Jewish Civil rights through the recognition and historicization of class in the oppression of Jews.

**Nir and Wainwright 2018 (**Oded, assistant professor at Vassar
college, Joel, professor at Ohio State, "Where Is the Marxist Critique
of Israel/Palestine", Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

**[Marxism and Zionism have a long and fraught relationship, extending
well beyond the territory of Palestine and Israel.]{.underline}** We
cannot offer a full genealogy of Marxism and Zionism; there is far too
much to say (see, e.g., Greenstein 2009; Hen-Tov 2017). We will consider
instead only three brief touchstones. Moses Hess (1812--75), one of the
founders of Zionism, was also a major influence on the early formation
of Karl Marx's thinking.9 Ber Borochov (1881--1917) led Poalei Tzion
(the Workers of Zion) Nir and Wainwright and provided major influence on
the kibbutz movement of the early twentieth century. A Marxist, Borochov
argued that the exclusion of Jewish workers from primary production in
the advanced capitalist countries made it impossible for them to
participate in proletarian struggle.10 Between Hess and Borochov, of
course, stands Karl Marx (1818--83). **[Marx's first foray into the
historical-materialist approach was applied to the question of Jewish
national rights]{.underline}**. In "On the Jewish Question," Marx (2009)
criticized the leftist Hegelian Bruno Bauer (1809--82). In Die
Judenfrage, **[Bauer argued that Jews in Europe should be denied civil
rights until they have abandoned Judaism.11 Marx, an atheist descendent
of a line of Rabbis and Jews, forcefully rebutted Bauer]{.underline}**.
**[Marx historicized the distinctive social and economic position of
Jews in Europe to show that the entire convoluted debate in Bauer's
conception of the "Jewish question" was misplaced and lacked a class
politics that considered how religious groups are transformed
differentially by the emergence of capitalism.]{.underline}** **[The
claim that Marx's essay is anti-Semitic not only lacks historical
sensibility]{.underline}** (the concept did not yet exist) **[but also
misses the crucial point that Marx wrote]{.underline}**, pace Bauer,
**[in defense of civil rights for Jews]{.underline}**. **[Yet Marx also
criticized the limited conception of citizenship then prevailing in
Europe, observing that citizenship]{.underline}** (formal political
emancipation) **[was insufficient.]{.underline}** **[What was
needed]{.underline}**, and not only for the Jews, **[was social
transformation: the emancipation of humanity from
capitalism.]{.underline}** Contemporary critics who seek to undo the
Israeli state's equating of Israeli citizenship and national security
with Jewish identity are therefore repeating the error revealed by
Marx's basic insight.

## Family Module

### Root Cause

#### The nuclear family emerges out of the transition from feudalism to capitalism.

**Thompson 14**, (Karl, \"The Marxist Perspective on The Family,\"
ReviseSociology,
https://revisesociology.com/2014/02/10/marxist-perspective-family
2-10-2014,)

Marxists argue that **[the nuclear family performs ideological functions
for Capitalism]{.underline}** **[-- the family acts as a unit of
consumption and teaches passive acceptance of hierarchy. It is also the
institution through which the wealthy pass down their private property
to their children, thus reproducing class inequality]{.underline}**.
This post is primarily designed to help students revise for the A level
sociology 7192 exam, paper 2, families and households option. Before
reading this post, you might like to look at this summary of the key
ideas of Marxism Marxist perspective family mind map Overview of the
Marxist Perspective Marxism is a 'structural conflict' perspective.
**[They see society as structured along class lines with institutions
generally working in the interests of the small elite class who have
economic power]{.underline}** (the 'Bourgeoisie') and the much larger
working class (the 'Proletariat'). The Bourgeoise gain their wealth from
exploiting the proletariat. There is thus a conflict of interests
between the Bourgeoise and the Proletariat. However, this conflict of
interests rarely boils over into revolution because **[institutions such
as the family perform the function of 'ideological control', or
convincing the masses that the present unequal system is inevitable,
natural and good]{.underline}**. Something else Marxists suggest about
the family (like the Functional Fit theory) is that the family type
generally changes with society **[-- more specifically, the nuclear
family emerges not because of the needs of industrialisation, but
because of the needs of the capitalist system]{.underline}**. Explaining
the emergence of the nuclear family -- Engels According to Engels,
**[the monogamous nuclear family only emerged with
Capitalism]{.underline}**. Before Capitalism, traditional, tribal
societies were classless and they practised a form of 'primitive
communism' in which there was no private property. In such societies,
property was collectively owned, and the family structure reflected this
-- there were no families as such, but tribal groups existed in a kind
of 'promiscuous horde' in which there were no restrictions on sexual
relationships. Marxist perspective nuclear family Hunter-gatherer
societies -- promiscuous hordes? **[However, with the emergence of
Capitalism in the 18th Century, society and the family changed.
Capitalism is based on a system of private ownership -- The bourgeois
use their own personal wealth to personally invest in businesses in
order to make a profit, they don't invest for the benefit of everyone
else.]{.underline}** Marxism Family**[Eventually the Bourgeois started
to look for ways to pass on their wealth to the next generation, rather
than having it shared out amongst the masses]{.underline}**, and this is
where the monogamous nuclear family comes from. It is the best way of
guaranteeing that you are passing on your property to your son, because
in a monogamous relationship you have a clear idea of who your own
children are. **[Ultimately what this arrangement does is to reproduce
inequality -- The children of the rich grow up into wealth, while the
children of the poor remain poor]{.underline}**. Thus the nuclear family
benefits the Bourgeois more than the proletariat. Criticisms of Engels
Gender inequality clearly preceded Capitalism..... The vast majority of
tribes in Africa and Asia are patriarchal, with women being barred from
owning property, having no political power, and having to do most of the
child care and hard physical labour. Wealthy Capitalist economies such
as the UK and USA have seen the fastest improvements in gender equality
over the last 100 years. Capitalism, increasing wealth and gender
equality within a nation seem to be correlated. Contemporary Marxism --
The family as an Ideological Apparatus **[The modern nuclear family
functions to promote values that ensure the reproduction and maintenance
of capitalism. The family is described as an ideological apparatus --
this means it socialises people to think in a way that justifies
inequality and encourages people to accept the capitalist system as
fair, natural and unchangeable]{.underline}**. One way in which this
happens is that there is a hierarchy in most families which teaches
children to accept there will always be someone in "authority" who they
must obey, which then mirrors the hierarchy of boss-worker in paid
employment in later life. Contemporary Marxism -- The Family as a Unit
of Consumption Capitalists/business owners want to keep workers' wages
down so they can make a profit, but to do so they must also be able to
sell the workers goods i.e. they must create demand for their products.
**[The family builds demand for goods in a number of ways 1) Families
must keep up with the material goods/services acquired by their
neighbours and peers e.g. family holidays, cars -- this is known
"Keeping up with the Joneses". There are significant amounts of
advertising and TV programmes influencing parents in this way. 2) The
media and companies target children in their advertising who then
persuade their parents through pester power to buy more expensive
items]{.underline}**. This is particularly bad in the UK where there few
legal restrictions on adverts aimed at children; in Sweden advertising
aimed at children under 12 is illegal.

### Cap k2 understand modern family structure

#### Their analysis of the family is ahistorical -- modern capital and state interests determine the family not gender or race

**Luke 7** (Timothy Luke. 12/13/2007. "Regulating the haven in a
heartless world: The state and family under advanced capitalism".
Timothy W. Luke is University Distinguished Professor of Political
Science in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences as well as

**[As large firms claimed a monopoly upon planning purposive-rational
action, the individual needs and private goals of families accepted the
definitions given to them by corporate capital. The need for air, drink,
food, clothing, shelter, praxis and affection, hitherto defined by the
\"homespun\" organic crafts of the bourgeois household, gained
commercial redefinition as the need for dehumidifying air conditioning,
Coca Cola, Wonder Bread, coats and ties, suburban
housing,]{.underline}** an MBA and a flesh and blood approximation of
some cinematic sex symbol. In commercially colonizing the traditional
rules and rituals of domestic reproduction, neither the large firm or
the modern state accepted the sanctity, privacy or autonomy of the
family. **[Bourgeois notions of frugality, sexual propriety, personal
trust, parental authority, family status and household autonomy placed
irrational limits, inefficient constraints and non-productive obstacles
before the total commodification of personal relations.]{.underline}**
The bourgeois family system, then, necessarily was dismantled from
without as professional experts in health care, childbirth, nutrition,
education, fashion, morality, elder care, shelter, leisure and funerary
services expropriated these functions from the family, where they had
been organically provided for use, to return them in exchange as
commodified goods and services. **[These rationally-designed
interventions, in turn, enabled the planning system of corporate
production \"to organize the entire society in its interest and
image.]{.underline}**\"32 **[Having made the real decisions about how
these satisfactions would be provided, corporate capital turned to the
state to make acceptance of exchange-based reproduction compulsory with
public health regulations, administrative nutritional requirements,
compulsory education, mandatory retirement, urban planning, national
recreation areas as well as a bevy of other public welfare services and
payments]{.underline}**.33 **[Confronting these new demands, the modern
family was reconstructed within the wreckage of the bourgeois family
system by an alliance of corporate capital, the state and clots of
individual consumers captured within the corporate family
system.]{.underline}** Corporate capital and the state decided what
particular material \"packages\" and behavioral \"scripts\" would be
provided in a spectrum of quality and quantity graded alternatives to
the consumer. **[In turn, the consumers could or would exercise their
\"free choice\" over the alternatives, delivering the need-satisfactions
required to fulfill their need-definitions, while boosting the GNP
growth rates healthy percentages per annum. In this fashion, the
individual personality becomes an integral element of the means of
production and the family becomes yet another delivery system of the
modern corporate state.]{.underline}** Seemingly, the corporate family
serves as a \"half-way house\" that inculcates the skills of adaptive
role performance in its members, but which leaves the definition of
roles to the school, television, specialty magazines, the workplace,
peer-groups or professional societies.34 As these other agencies define
the child and the parent as they \"grow\" or \"develop\" as \"persons,\"
it is the family, or, at least, its income, that provides these people
with access to food, drink, shelter and clothing. Speaking in a similar
vein, Lasch observes that, By providing the child with emotional
security in his early years and then by giving him a high degree of
independence, the isolated nuclear family trains a type of personality
ideally equipped to face the rigors of the modern world. Permissiveness,
which many observers mistake for an abdication of parental
responsibility, actually amounts to a new way of training achievement.
It prepares the child to deal with an unpredictable world in which he
will constantly find himself faced with unstructured situations. In
dealing with such exigencies, he has little use for hard-and-fast
principles of duty and conduct learned from his parents. He needs the
ability to take care of himself, to make quick decisions, and to adapt
quickly to many types of contingencies. In a slower world, parents could
act as role models for their children, but the modern parent. . . can
hope only to provide his children with the resources he needs to survive
on his own. We should not be deceived by the \"leeway\" granted to their
children by American parents. . . . Modern parents fulfill their
obligations to the young precisely by refraining from the attempt to
inculcate precepts and standards that would prove useless in a world
where nothing is fixed. What looks like \"abdication\" in simply
realism.\" Lasch slightly overstates his case inasmuch as corporate
capital does remain permanently fixed in underpinning the contemporary
family system. **[Nonetheless, one needs only refer to the innumerable
commercial texts ceaselessly beamed into the home to witness how
corporate consciousness management values ignoring one\'s parents,
forgetting duty, dropping loyalty and quick thinking in a changing
world.]{.underline}** Every floor wax, junk food or laundry soap ad that
pits grandma, mom and grandchild against each other in pitched battles
over the differential virtues of the same soap renewed and improved
every generation to meet \"new cleaning needs\" leaves the grandchild
castigating her elders for their obsolescent product loyalties or
rehabilitating the oldsters\' consumer consciousness with new cues for
adapting to the rapidly changing contingencies of detergent technology.
[**Having briefly surveyed the structural transitions from the bourgeois
to the corporate family system**, **the underlying logic of
\"consummativity\" with its ethic of personal development needs to be
further examined as the basis of the corporate family.**]{.underline}
The next section of this investigation, then, will tentatively start
towards undertaking this task to indicate how consumption serves as a
means of social, political and economic regulation.

### RC of nuclear family

#### The nuclear family is structure and maintained by capitalist ideology -- analyzing its historical context as the production of a social economic unit is key.

**Bobier 2015**(Faline Bobier; March 2, 2015; "Capitalism and the
family"; http://www.socialist.ca/node/2659 )

Since the early days of the Second Wave Women's Movement (of the 1960s
and 1970s) and long before, the question of control over our bodies has
been a fundamental question for women seeking liberation. This has to do
with the role of women inside the nuclear family under capitalism, which
tends to enforce and reinforce the idea that women's fundamental role in
society is that of mother and caregiver to the next generation of
workers. And, in spite of all the advances that women have made through
our own struggles, often allied with our brothers in the union movement,
the family continues to be the dominant ideology peddled by right-wing
governments and media alike. Of course, it is true that there have been
major advances for women in the arenas of education, entry into
non-traditional jobs and most importantly around the question of access
to contraception and abortion. If a woman has no control over her
reproductive life, over decisions about when and with whom to have
children, she can have little control over other aspects of her life.
**[Over the last few years, though, it's become clear that any gains we
have made are also under constant threat because of the economic system
we live under---capitalism. The modern nuclear family as we know it
today was solidified as an institution of use to capital during the
Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. The nuclear family At the
time, the growth of industrial capitalism was actually killing working
class family life, since it was pulling all family members (including
pregnant women and children) in to the factories and
mines]{.underline}**. Women were dying in childbirth and children were
subject to long working hours and horrendous conditions, as of course
were men and women as well. **[There was no real family life. This
frightened some capitalists, who realized that if there was no stable
family life, no ability for people to regenerate and rest for the next
working day, they were going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg
of profits.]{.underline}** Their fears came together with the desires of
working class people who fought for some protections for women and
children (and men), so that they would stop dying in the workplace.
Working class people wanted to live lives with some joy, some
possibility of sharing their lives with the people they loved, some
respite from the inhumane round of work, eat, sleep. As Marx said,
"Human beings make history, but not in conditions of their own
choosing." So it was that workers won struggles around advances such as
a shorter working day and instituting child labour laws. However, at the
same time, the nuclear family, with father as the head of the household
and mother at home caring for children, became the norm and served to
imprison women inside the family hearth. This was so even if the
so-called family wage---supposedly paid to men so that women could stay
at home and look after children---was never a reality for working class
families. Working class women have always had to seek employment outside
the home, usually in low-paid, ghettoized jobs, in order for the family
to survive. On top of this work outside the home**[, capitalism
constantly pushes the idea that women---whether they work for pay or
not---are the ones who are and should be overwhelmingly responsible for
housework and childcare]{.underline}**. This does a great service to the
bosses, since they profit from the surplus value they extract from
women's wages at work and also from all the unpaid labour it requires to
bring up the next generation of workers. This ideology is especially
useful in periods of economic crisis, as we are living through today,
when governments are removing more and more work from the public sphere
(cuts to healthcare, services for kids and families, services for the
elderly, etc.) and foisting it onto individual families---and
disproportionately onto individual women in those families. It is no
wonder the family---which we are led to believe should be the one place
where we can expect to find love and caring---is often a cauldron of
abuse and unhappiness. The pressures on the family to provide a humane
oasis in a society based on greed, profit for the few and destruction of
the very environment we depend on to survive, are enormous. Alternatives
But things don't have to be this way. It is neither fair nor necessary
that we continue to accept the way things are under capitalism. Just as
indigenous people across Canada are resisting the Harper government and
the priorities of that government (creating the sink hole of the Tar
Sands, which is destroying indigenous families, their land, their
livelihood at the same time it is polluting the planet) we can join
together on this IWD to pledge together to build the new society and new
families we need to survive. In order to do that, though, we will
ultimately need to get rid of a system whose priorities have nothing to
do with real choices for women or for any of us. The early years of the
Russian Revolution show a glimpse of what's possible. Beginning on IWD
in 1917, women made historic gains (abortion and divorce on demand,
collective kitchens and crèches) as part of a revolutionary
transformation of society---before it was destroyed by invading armies
and internal counter-revolution. Alexandra Kollontai was a leading
revolutionary who theorized about women's liberation in the transition
from capitalism to socialism as these changes were unfolding. As she
explained in Theses on Communist Morality in the Sphere of Marital
Relations, written in 1921, "Family and marriage are historical
categories, phenomena which develop in accordance with the economic
relations that exist at the given level of production. The form of
marriage and of the family is thus determined by the economic system of
the given epoch, and it changes as the economic base of society
changes... In the era of private property and the bourgeois-capitalist
economic system, marriage and the family are grounded in (a) material
and financial considerations, (b) economic dependence of the female sex
on the family breadwinner -- the husband -- rather than the social
collective, and (c) the need to care for the rising generation." But
under socialism, "**[The external economic functions of the family
disappear, and consumption ceases to be organised on an individual
family basis, a network of social kitchens and canteens is established,
and the making, mending and washing of clothes and other aspects of
housework 'are integrated into the national economy...]{.underline}**
The economic subjugation of women in marriage and the family is done
away with, and responsibility for the care of the children and their
physical and spiritual education is assumed by the social
collective**[... Once the family has been stripped of its economic
functions and its responsibilities towards the younger generation and is
no longer central to the existence of the woman, it has ceased to he a
family. The family unit shrinks to a union of two people based on mutual
agreement."]{.underline}** **[As Engels wrote in his groundbreaking
work, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State,
socialism and the material conditions it ushers in will allow everyone
to define their relationships, not based on the needs of a system based
on profit, but on their own desires and needs, in community with
others]{.underline}**: "What we can now conjecture about the way in
which sexual relations will be ordered after the impending overthrow of
capitalist production is mainly of a negative character, limited for the
most part to what will disappear. But what will there be new? That will
be answered when a new generation has grown up...they will care precious
little what anybody today thinks they ought to do; they will make their
own practice and their corresponding public opinion about the practice
of each individual -- and that will be the end of it."

## Sustainable

### 2AC -- Sustainable

#### Capitalism is sustainable -- innovation and crisis uphold robust growth

**Bosch and Schmidt 19** (Stephan Bosch; Professor at the Department of
Human Geography, Institute of Geography University Augsburg; Matthias
Schmidt; 4/1/19; "Is the post-fossil era necessarily post-capitalistic?
-- The robustness and capabilities of green capitalism";
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180091830956X>;
accessed 7/28/19)

6\. Conclusion In this paper, we argued that **[capitalism is not only
much more robust than presumed by its critics, but moreover features
promising capabilities with regard to solving the environmental
crisis]{.underline}**. At the beginning, we elucidated that
**[capitalism is able to prevail even given the end of fossil energy
carriers and to maintain its productivity also within a regenerative
energy system. Innovative concepts of storage, direct current
transmission, and smart grids play a core role herein]{.underline}**.
Moreover, we were able to show that **[crisis is an essential element of
the capitalist social order, with critical situations even being able to
provide the necessary preconditions for the economy\'s transformation
towards sustainability. Innovation is an essential ingredient of this
process. We argued that precisely the preconditions given in competitive
capitalism generate innovations]{.underline}**. Therefore, in our view,
**[the decisive social advantage of a competition-oriented capitalist
system is this:]{.underline}** as expressed by Schumpeter\'s concept of
creative destruction, it **[offers maximum incentive for entrepreneurial
initiatives]{.underline}**. According to the theory of economic
development, this **[incentive cannot be given within the socialist
markets or degrowth-oriented societies favoured]{.underline}**, but not
more specifically detailed, by Harris (2013) and Kallis (2011). Yet this
stimulus is crucial as it is accompanied by **[greater innovational
strength, thus providing more auspicious preconditions for
groundbreaking innovations, e.g. regarding aspects of technology,
education, vocational training, research, social infrastructure,
medicine, and nature protection]{.underline}** (Schumpeter, 1994;
Iversen, 2005; Wangler, 2013). However, we again want to point out
thenumerous social problems of the deployment of renewable energies
(e.g. Aitken, 2010), especially concerning large-scale infrastructure
projects (e.g. Avila, 2018). In the context of competitive capitalism as
described by Schumpeter, **[the promising capabilities of green
capitalism were presented in detail]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, the
predominant criticism of capitalism scarcely assumes the Schumpeterian
concept of 'creative destruction'. Rather, it focuses on a much later
stage of evolution of the economic system, in which the socio-economic
disparities as a result of economic, but also of other factors have
manifested themselves distinctly and with great complexity (cf.
trustified capitalism). **[The pure criticism of capitalism thus seems
to us to be too superficial as an explanatory model]{.underline}**,
which relies on arguments that disregard precisely those fertile
approaches to surmounting the energetic and environmental crisis that
presently arise from numerous processes of creative destruction. The
cradle-to-cradle approach illustrated above is only one example of a
concept that, by means of innovation, abandons the old and establishes
the new. Yet we also think that competition and the market alone will
not suffice to concertedly solve the global environmental crisis. This
calls for political action that, **[by creating suitable institutional
frame conditions, succeeds in pooling society\'s forces with regard to
the ecological questions of our time, thus specifically promoting
innovation]{.underline}**. We demonstrated that **[the usefulness of
state measures always also depends on the respective specific national
and economic context]{.underline}**. An objection to capitalist social
orders in general disregards this diversity of contexts and is at risk
of overlooking important determinants of crisis management. The decisive
difference in the various capitalist systems\' innovative strength lies
in the degree **[to which the cooperation of the major market players --
state, enterprises, science, and civil society -- is
institutionalised]{.underline}**. This implies that a central part falls
to the state in embedding the actions of the most important players into
appropriate institutional structures. Only thereby will it be possible
to shoulder the heavy load of material, costs, work, and coordination
required for the energy system\'s transformation. A non-committal state
runs the risk of failing this task. E.g., Solomon and Krishna (2011)
showed that the intended transformation of the energy system in the USA
after the oil crisis was unsuccessful due to the lack of suitable
preconditions for innovation in niche markets. Moreover, Ćetković and
Buzogány (2016) found that in liberal manifestations of capitalism, the
deficiency of political and institutional instruments inhibits the
necessary orchestration of activities on the part of state, industry,
and financial sector. In sum, even though fossil fuels and the
capitalist system based upon them **[have given rise to the
environmental crisis, surmounting the crisis does not necessarily call
for surmounting market-based approaches]{.underline}**; rather,
**[market economies based on regenerative energy systems that are
competition-oriented and guided by state measures may develop great
ecological]{.underline}** and socio-economic
**[effectivity]{.underline}**.

### AT: Crisis

#### Crisis is good and creates resiliency in capitalism

**Bosch and Schmidt 19** (Stephan Bosch; Professor at the Department of
Human Geography, Institute of Geography University Augsburg; Matthias
Schmidt; 4/1/19; "Is the post-fossil era necessarily post-capitalistic?

accessed 7/28/19)

3.2. Crisis as an element of capitalist social order We hold the view
that **[the occurrence of crises in capitalism is not due to it being an
ailing, doomed economic order; nor is it a proof of capitalism\'s
ineptitude for meeting ecological challenges]{.underline}**. Instead, we
deem that **[crisis is a fundamental element of the capitalist social
order that actually provides a chance for readjusting economic
processes]{.underline}**. Harvey (2011) explains that anything blocking
the circulation and accumulation of capital may pose a threat to the
capitalist system and induce a fundamental crisis. The finiteness of
fossil fuels is a crisis of this kind (McCarthy, 2015). Altvater (2007)
is convinced that capit- alism will not be able to overcome this crisis;
therefore, future tech- nologic progress had to be embedded in a
non-fossil, non-capitalist framework. Kallis (2011) also emphasises that
the approach to a steady state (cf. Daly, 1991, 2005) will transform the
institutional precondi- tions of property, work, banking, and
distribution to such an extent that in the end, it will be impossible to
still identify them as capitalistic. With regard to Kallis\' doubts
concerning the institutional robustness of capitalism, Schumpeter points
out that **[precisely the ups and downs of industrial development, which
are the outcomes of successful in- novations\' intensifying competition,
enable progress]{.underline}** (Herzog and Honneth, 2016). As **[crises
therefore represent an immanent part of the capitalist
system]{.underline}**, an environmental and resources-related crisis
caused by the capitalistic process does not provide sufficient evidence
to sug- gest a possible downfall of the capitalistic social order.
**[The crisis might even be taken as proof of an economic cycle, if it
is regarded as a period of depression between the dwindling fossil and
the emerging re- generative age]{.underline}**. Böhm et al. (2012) and
McCarthy (2015) confirm that **[capitalism is capable of overcoming even
fundamental crises, actually using these as starting points of its
further expansion]{.underline}**. Concerning the environmental crisis,
Harriss-White and Harriss (2007) also concede that the deployment of
renewable energies holds the potential of founding a new form of
capitalism that is characterised by a much lower degree of materialistic
lavishness. Bettini and Karaliotas (2013) emphasise that from a
neo-liberal point of view, the accusation of ca- pitalism bringing about
a resources-related and environmental crisis does not at all provoke
self-doubts. Rather, it caused the profitable marketing of adequate
approaches to solutions in the field of resource depletion and
environmental impacts to move into economic focus. Even Altvater (2007)
points out that the externalised effects of pro- duction and consumption
on nature become relevant for companies once they jeopardise
profitability and accumulation. In that case, **[en- vironmental
problems and their solutions can actually be made part of capitalist
logic.]{.underline}** Solomon and Krishna (2011) are convinced that in
order to solve the environmental crisis, it were not even necessary to
achieve further technologic breakthroughs, as the technologies needed
for the remodeling of society towards energy efficiency were already
mature and cost-efficient. Even if capitalism might be sufficiently
robust, Kallis (2011) still takes the crisis as a chance to break up
obstructive social and political lock-ins that have hitherto seemed
unalterable and have lead into the crisis. Yet he does not regard the
ability of social and political trans- formation to be inherent in the
traits of market, but as a characteristic of a social order orientated
towards degrowth. Certainly, Kallis is right in saying that the market
is hard to control, making a concerted transformation towards
sustainability difficult. Still his criticism only refers to that form
of capitalism which Schumpeter characterised as trustified capitalism
and which does lead to ecologically problematic lock-in effects. The
criticism cannot, however, be applied tocompetitive capitalism, which
generates those basic innovations giving rise to the revolutionary
crises described as so fertile by Kallis (2011). Thus, an opportunity is
provided for alternative social conditions to be brought about -- but
within the capitalist social order -- and for sub- stantiating these new
conditions through further innovations. Innova- tions may emerge outside
of competition and market economy, but will then lack the required
frequency and force, as growth represents the most important incentive
of innovation (Wangler, 2013). **[On the other hand, a continuous
process of innovation again leads to growth, which may revolutionise the
present social conditions]{.underline}**, as Schumpeter states (Herzog
and Honneth, 2016). Thereby, a new combination of the given means of
production within new sites of production emerges, gen- erating new
goods, methods, and markets. **[Productive resources are applied to
hitherto untested usages while being withdrawn from those usages they
served before (]{.underline}**Geels, 2011). What Kallis (2011) terms
**[technological optimism with regard to the ecological innovative power
of capitalism, is therefore technological realism in the context of
Schumpeter\'s competitive capitalism]{.underline}**.

### AT: Resource Shortages

#### Resources are infinite -- innovation and renewables solve shortage

\*note: this card also answers Jevon's Paradox

**Bosch and Schmidt 19** (Stephan Bosch; Professor at the Department of
Human Geography, Institute of Geography University Augsburg; Matthias
Schmidt; 4/1/19; "Is the post-fossil era necessarily post-capitalistic?
-- The robustness and capabilities of green capitalism";

accessed 7/28/19)

4\. Capabilities of green capitalism **[A competitive green capitalism
develops great creativity by its high rate of innovation]{.underline}**,
which may also reinvent the relationship between humans and nature. We
now want to exemplify how this might be brought about. Schumpeter holds
the view that **[innovation is the result of the ca- pitalistic
entrepreneurial spirit]{.underline}**, not the other way round (Herzog
and Honneth, 2016). **[Tech]{.underline}**nological **[and social
progress]{.underline}** hence are no in- dependent variables
materialising out of thin air, but **[arise from the logic of the
capitalist process]{.underline}**. Meadows et al. (2004) accept that
**[in- novations may relocate the limits of growth, making it possible
to maintain the living standard by continuously reducing the consumption
of crude materials and energy]{.underline}**. However, one of the energy
system\'s prevailing deficits is that depleted or not yet tapped
resources are being (re-)obtained based on non-regenerative energy
(Schwartzman, 2008), causing capitalistic production to be increasingly
energetically in- efficient (Murphy and Hall, 2011). **[Overcoming the
energy crisis hence calls for the consideration of thermodynamic
principles]{.underline}** (Georgescu- Roegen, 1971, 1986;
Martinez-Alier, 1987). Harriss-White and Harriss (2007) **[see the
deployment of renewable energies as a possibility of limiting the
creation of entropy]{.underline}**. Kaberger and Mansson (2001) have
shown that **[innovative resources-saving material cycles may be
possible and economical]{.underline}** if they are based on the usage of
the inexhaustible energy of irradiance. What is promising about this
approach is that, due to research and development, **[the utilisation of
solar energy becomes more and more efficient and
lucrative]{.underline}** (Schmid, 2016). Moreover, **[its inexhaustible
potential allows for the exploitation of material resources even from
deposits with extremely low crude material density]{.underline}**. On a
local level, the utilisation of solar energy may actually lead to a re-
duction of entropy (Ebeling et al., 1998; Kranert and Cord-Landwehr,
2010), as it is the case **[with the usage of waste heat of solar
thermal power plants for the desalination of sea water]{.underline}**
(DLR, 2007). **[The in- tegration of these capacities into smart grids
and the associated re- modeling of every production process to purely
regenerative sources]{.underline}** have been detailed in Section 3. We
further argue that **[innovation surpasses
conceivability]{.underline}**. Even Harris (2010) sees a particularly
high potential in unpredictable tech- nological innovations to break
through economic routine, thus en- couraging further entrepreneurs in
issuing their own innovations. Ca- pitalism might thereby be provided
with the chance to reduce its ecological exploitation. But **[innovation
exceeds strictly technological aspects and may as well comprise social
and institutional aspects]{.underline}** (Arentsen and Bellekom, 2014).
E.g., in the mobility sector, whose pollutant emissions have
significantly contributed to the environmental crisis, innovations have
led to new features of cargo and passenger transportation. This is
illustrated by the example of car sharing as an innovative life style
(Prettenthaler and Steininger, 1999) or bicycle- sharing schemes in
urban areas (Midgley, 2011). Another re- presentative case is the
history of the ozone hole, which Meadows et al. (2004) describe as a
history of civil success regarding the correction of a severe overshoot.
Quite in the sense of Schumpeter, Meadows et al. (2004) name the
'industry\'s creative heads' as the crucial problem-sol- ving
determinant**[. Through the three innovative boosts 'better insula-
tion', 'reduced toxic substitute materials', and 'emission-free
alternative substances', it will be possible to rebuild the original
density of the ozone layer by the mid-21st century]{.underline}**.
Remarkably, **[this is]{.underline}** realised **[without abandoning the
existent economic system]{.underline}**. Furthermore, we argue that it
is realistic to assume growth-oriented, competitive markets in the
future, rather than socio-material conditions beyond them, which, as
stated by Van den Bergh (2011) are completely uncertain as of now (e.g.
Harris, 2013: socialist markets). We therefore hold the view that it is
more pragmatic to design future mass markets in an eco-friendly way.
Kallis (2011) rejects the possibility that the wonder of a demater-
ialised economy might occur, as improvements of efficiency were
overcompensated by growing consumption. While dematerialisation may be
tantamount to a wonder, researchers still do put effort into adjusting
the materialised economy to ecological compatibility. One aspect is the
thorough redefinition of nature protection, because nowadays, nature
protection is reduced to the attempt of limiting the harmfulness of
processes and products (Mulhall and Braungart, 2010). However, due to
the potential creation of new mass markets for more eco-friendly and
efficient processes or products, this strategy holds the danger of
actually augmenting unwanted effects through rebound ef- fects. In this
regard, **[Alcott]{.underline}** (2005) **[points to the Jevon\'s
Paradox which says it is a great error to think that technologic
innovations were going to reduce the consumption of
resources]{.underline}**. Polimeni et al. (2015) name the example of the
**[Green Revolution: the remarkable increase of food production\'s area
efficiency was not at all able to abate the problems of hunger and area
consumption, as consequently, the population greatly
increased]{.underline}**. Likewise, a mass market of efficient and
eco-friendly pro- ducts would again lead to a massive amount of poison
and waste, with disposed crude materials hardly being recycled. The
ecological costs then would have to be externalised, which Sturm and
Vogt (2011) re- gard as strong evidence of the failure of the market.
The core problem hence lies in the fact that products are being produced
exclusively for the technosphere (McDonough and Braungart, 2013). E.g.,
copper is almost universally applicable to and beneficial for
technological systems, while in biological systems, this material is ex-
tremely poisonous. Thus, the aim must be to design products in a way
that makes them equally usable in biosphere, i.e. subsequent to their
technical usage. This calls for the development of a combined man-
agement of nutrients for techno- and biosphere. Human ways of living,
the processes and products they are based on, may thereby be employed
for the benefit of nature. **[The focus must therefore be put on those
innovations that break up the present paradigm of environmental
protection by realising products that create a useful material
connection between techno- and biosphere]{.underline}**. An example of
this kind of creative destruction is the Austrian company Gugler, **[the
first print shop worldwide that produces printing products free from
harmful ingredients and exclusively with substances that can be
biologically recycled]{.underline}** (Gugler GmbH, 2018). E.g., the
accruing **[sludge is returned to biosphere and the ash of burned
printing products can be reused as a fertilizer]{.underline}**. These
conditions provide the possibility of **[de- signing economic activities
to be ecologically compatible]{.underline}** despite a high resource
throughput.

### AT: Peak Oil

#### Peak oil theory is a myth

**Bardi 18** (Ugo Bardi; professor in Physical Chemistry at the
University of Florence, researcher on materials for new energy sources,
a contributor for The Oil Drum, president of ASPO Italy, a member of the
scientific committee of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and
Gas; 11/10/18; "Peak oil, 20 years later: Failed prediction or useful
insight?";
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618303207>;
accessed 7/27/19)

**[Today, 20 years have passed since the publication of the
groundbreaking Scientific American report]{.underline}** \[1\]. **[The
expected world peak has not arrived]{.underline}**, at least in terms of
a reduction of the global supply of liquid fuels \[11\] **[and, in
general, the concept of peak oil has faded from the mainstream
discussion as well as from the scientific literature]{.underline}**.
ASPOinternational seems to have disappeared as an active association
around 2012--2013, although some national branches of the association
still exist. **[The generally accepted explanation for the fading
interest in the concept attributes it to the "wrong predictions" of the
date of the peak and, from there, most mainstream reports tend to define
the whole concept as wrong and misleading]{.underline}** (see e.g. the
article by Luts in 2012 on Forbes \[12\]). The present paper has the
purpose of examining the cycle of the peak oil movement, mainly in terms
of how the public and the policy makers react to assessments that we
could define as "predictions of doom." The paper is organized as
follows: first it examines how the peak oil model fared in predicting
real world trends, then it examines how the popularity of the model
surged and then declined, and, finally, discusses the reasons for the
decline. The conclusion is that the decline of interest in peak oil is
only marginally related to the validity of the concept as a predictive
tool. Rather, it appears to be related to a "clash of absolutes" that
sees the idea of decline caused by resource depletion incompatible with
the current mainstream views of the economic system. First of all, let's
examine how the 'peakers' predictions fared over the past 20 years. Of
course, there was no single prediction produced by people using the
bell-shaped curve but, rather, a whole range of predictions, most of
them seeing the global production peak to occur within the first 2--3
decades of the 21st century. In most cases, these models used as an
input an assessment of the "ultimate recoverable resources" (URR), the
total amount of oil that could be reasonably produced globally. The URR
was determined by means of a combination of geological data and
statistical methods aimed at obtaining reasonable estimates for areas
for which no geological data were available. As obvious, the value of
the URR for a certain region could be potentially affected by political
considerations and, already in 1998, Campbell and Laherrére had noted
suspiciously sharp increases in the reserves reported by some OPEC
producing states \[1\]. In addition, they noted that new oil discoveries
had not been matching production starting in the late 1980s, a
phenomenon termed "the growing gap" and illustrated several times in the
ASPO newsletter. This gap was considered as evidence that oil production
was depleting the reserves faster than they could be replaced. An
alternative approach was to use the historical data to determine the
URR. In some cases, that was accomplished by means of the "Hubbert
Linearization Method" \[13\]. In the simplest approach, used for
instance by Deffeyes \[14\], the URR was one of the parameters of a
model that fitted the historical production data with the derivative of
a logistic function -- the area under the curve was constrained to
correspond to the URR. In other approaches, the expected lifetime curves
of single production provinces were summed up in order to obtain a
global curve -- this was, for instance, the method used by Campbell and
Lahèrrere \[1,4\]. In 1998 \[1\], they stated that the production of
conventional oil would reach a maximum around 2005 at a level of about
74 million barrels per day and that, in any case, "the decline will
begin before 2010.″ Later ASPO estimates updated the prediction and
added "non-conventional" oil to the model. Fig. 1 shows the last
forecast for the global production curve published on the ASPO
newsletter in 2010. The peak for "regular oil" is supposed to appear in
2008. If other kinds of oil (heavy, polar, etc.) are included, the
production peak appears later, around 2010, at about 80 million
barrels/year. Estimates reported by other researchers placed the peak at
later dates. For instance, a 2004 report by the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) placed the peak within a range going from 2026 to
2047 \[15\]. Nevertheless, the predictions of the ASPO group remained at
the center of the interest in the field. **[An important problem, here,
is what's to be intended exactly as "oil". In the oil industry, it is
customary to class liquid hydrocarbons into two categories,
"conventional" and "non-conventional."]{.underline}** This
classification has historical origins: in the early times of the
industry all oil was referred to as "crude oil." Still today, crude and
conventional oil are considered synonyms and are defined as "relatively
light, flowableoil found in fields" \[7\]. "Non-conventional" oil,
instead, includes a wide range of substances, such as high density
"heavy" oil, "deepwater oil", "polar oil," and everything that can be
turned into a liquid fuel, from shale oil to the oil obtained from coal
processing. **[Some of these liquids are not even fossil hydrocarbons,
as it is the case for biofuels, sometimes added to the
total]{.underline}**. Then, the International Energy Agency (IEA)
normally includes "refinery gains" in the total liquids production, that
is, increases in volume resulting from a lower density of the final
product. It should go without saying that these gains add nothing to the
quantity of energy produced by a certain volume of oil. **[The variety
of types of oil adds a considerable complexity to the debate and it
surely clouded the discussion on peak]{.underline}** oil. In the text of
their 1998 article, Campbell and Laherrere stated more than once that
their prediction was for conventional oil only. But in the figure
caption of the main graph of the article, the curve is described as
referring to "both conventional and unconventional." According to Kjell
Aleklett \[16\] this statement is an editorial intervention performed
without the consensus of the authors but that's a further element of
confusion in the story. In later issues of the ASPO newsletter, Campbell
added the "nonconventional" category to his projections, but these new
data didn't include some forms of liquids that would become important
later on, such as shale oil. **[In general, it seems that most authors
who were part of the peak oil movement tended to underestimate the role
of nonconventional oil.]{.underline}** For example, in the 2005 book,
"Beyond Oil \[13\]," by Kenneth S. Deffeys, non-conventional oil sources
are mentioned, but the conclusion is that (p. 108) these sources, "are
not going forward on a scale large enough to postpone the Hubbert peak."
Having clarified, as much as possible, the methods and the assumptions
used by the proponents of the peak oil idea, we can list the ASPO
predictions over the 1998--2010 period as follows: 1 The world's oil
production should follow a bell-shaped curve. 2 The global production
peak of conventional oil should occur not later than 2010 at a level of
the order of 70--75 million barrels per day (Mb/day). 3 The discoveries
of new crude oil resources should remain well below consumption. 4 Oil
prices should rise sharply. Let's now examine how these predictions
fared, one by one. 1. The bell shaped production curve. The examination
of a largenumber of productive regions confirms Hubbert's intuition that
the bellshaped production curve is a common feature, even though the
curve is not necessarily symmetric. Brandt \[17\] found that in most
historical cases production follows the curve, although the decline is
slower than growth. It has been argued that the opposite could be true
in the global case \[18\] or in cases of isolated systems \[19\].
**[However, in many cases, it was found that a single bell-shaped curve
is not sufficient to describe the production cycle of a certain region.
This is the case, for instance, of Russia and the US, where the decline
after peaking was reversed by a new cycle of growth. In the case of the
world's oil production, the bell curve is not clearly detectable
today,]{.underline}** but it could also be argued that peaking and
declining are going to occur in the near future. Therefore, we can say
that the result of this prediction is correct.

### AT: Peak Phosphorus

#### Chemical recycling solves phosphorus shortages

**Li et al 19** (Binlin Li; College of Economics and Management, Yunnan
Agricultural University; KB Bicknell; Department of Global Value Chains
and Trade, Lincoln University; Alan Renwick; Department of Global Value
Chains and Trade, Lincoln University; 3/22/19; "Peak phosphorus, demand
trends and implications for the sustainable management of phosphorus in
China";
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344919301399>;
accessed 7/26/19)

6\. Discussion **[It may seem paradoxical to focus on the impending
scarcity of a resource]{.underline}** that is associated with widely
recognized negative external effects, but it is equally important to be
mindful of the fact that **[phosphorus is currently unequivocally tied
to the concept of food security]{.underline}** for many phosphorus-poor
emerging economies, and that---as with fossil fuels---**[a transition to
alternative sources of phosphorus is a pro- cess that requires planning
and discovery within a very multi-disciplinary context]{.underline}**.
6.1. Planetary phosphorus boundaries The "planetary boundary" concept
offers an eco-oriented systems approach to considering quantitative
measures of sustainability (Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen et al.,
2015). Globally, transgressions were identified for most phosphorus
boundaries in 2010, and the situation is expected to deteriorate
significantly by 2050 if no relative improvement in phosphorus flows is
achieved (Conijn et al., 2018). There is evidence that China has already
crossed the planetary boundaries for eutrophication of freshwater and
marine environments due to high phosphorus flows. First, **[phosphorus
fertilizer application has rapidly increased far beyond the level
required by crops]{.underline}** in many of China\'s intensive
agricultural areas (Bai et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2011). Second, a high proportion of the phosphorus applied to cropland
flows into freshwater systems and then to coastal areas, re- sulting in
eutrophication of freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems (Huang et
al., 2017). Third, five provinces in China \[Hainan (27.9%), Yunnan
(18.4%), Guangdong (14.5%), Guangxi (11.6%), and Fujian (7.5%)\] are
estimated to have the largest influence on global freshwater
eutrophication potential (Huang et al., 2017). Taken together, the
concepts of peak phosphorus and safe planetary boundaries for phosphorus
highlight a critical tension between food security and environmental
sustainability objectives. Tolerable upper limits for a "safe operating
space for humanity" appears to interlink the availability and
accessibility of phosphorus. Large amounts of cheap and accessible
phosphorus and excessive phosphorus use have resulted in deteriorating
aquatic ecosystems in China, but they have also led to food security
concerns stemming from phosphorus depletion and supply security.
Therefore, the critical phosphorus challenge for China will be: "Can
China provide sufficient phosphorus for meeting local andimporters' food
demand within planetary phosphorus boundaries in the coming decades?"
Adopting a combination of two quantitative ap- proaches in this paper
enables us to highlight the tradeoff between the depletion of phosphorus
and limitations on the carrying capacity of the environment without
being distracted by unhelpful generalities. 6.2. **[Phosphorus recovery
and recycling]{.underline}** Developing the concept of **[a circular
phosphorus economy may]{.underline}** help **[alleviate an impending
scarcity of conventional sources of phosphorus]{.underline}** and
mitigate the external effects of excessive phosphorus use by fo- cusing
valuable attention on providing a variety of technical solutions for
recovery and recycling phosphorus from various waste streams (Leinweber
et al., 2018; Lwin et al., 2017). **[Possible technical solutions for
phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater and sewage sludge
treatment and recycling have been outlined and summarized in the
existing literature]{.underline}**. For example, **[struvite
precipitation has been suggested for wastewater treatment
plants]{.underline}** (Corre et al., 2009). Although struvite
**[recovery]{.underline}** of phosphorus **[is being implemented in
Europe]{.underline}** (Chowdhury et al., 2017), this technique cur-
rently has a practically limited application range and a low recovery
rate (5--25%) (Leinweber et al., 2018). **[Other recovery techniques in-
clude chemical-based phosphorus recovery solutions]{.underline}**
(Bradfordhartke et al., 2015) **[and sludge incineration with phosphorus
recovery from mono-incineration ash]{.underline}** (Linderholm et al.,
2012). Unfortunately, these solutions are currently considered
chemically, energetically, and oper- ationally intensive (Karunanithi et
al., 2015), too costly to compete with mined phosphate (Mayer et al.,
2016), and not ecologically sus- tainable (Roy, 2017). Roy (2017)
further summarized ecological en- gineering approaches for phosphorus
recovery and recycling. These approaches include composting;
vermicomposting; biogas residues; assimilation of phosphorus by
macrophytes, algae and trees; phytoex- traction; zooextraction;
aquaculture; aquaponics; hydroponics; filter substrates; biochar; and
human urine and feces. **[At this]{.underline}** relatively **[early
stage, these solutions have remained in- efficient and
non-profitable]{.underline}**, and none have been implemented on a large
scale (Leinweber et al., 2018; Roy, 2017). In China, phosphorus
companies remain dependent on low-cost phosphate rock. All of the
potential technical recycling and recovery solutions have economic,
environmental, technical, regulatory, organizational, and individual
behavior barriers to overcome (Pearce, 2015). **[However, continuing
efforts to develop novel technologies to create a circular phosphorus
economy will facilitate a critically needed transition towards a more
ecologically sustainable system]{.underline}** that will also support
food security goals and slow the depletion of finite phosphorus
resources.

## Cap Good

### Cap Inevitable

#### Alternatives to capitalism are deeply flawed and therefore always fail- historical examples shows

**Wright 18** (Nicola-Wright; writer and editor for LibertyWorks,
3/1/18, "What Has Capitalism Ever Done For Us?",
<https://quillette.com/2018/03/01/capitalism-ever-done-us/>)

**[Critics of capitalism hark back to pre-capitalist societies as
exemplars of egalitarianism. But, without exception, people choose to
break free of these societies when given the chance. They willingly
embrace a capitalist system; they want things, as do we
all.]{.underline}** Tellingly, most critics of the capitalist system do
not willingly remove themselves from it. As they continue to enjoy the
benefits of smartphones, supermarkets, and automobiles, and watch
Netflix on their MacBooks, they are supporting the very system they
claim to oppose. And why wouldn't they**[? Any sane person who has the
good fortune to benefit from the capitalist system, will. Private
property ownership, the foundation on which capitalism stands, is the
principle that allows people to benefit from their own labour. If you
make something, you get to keep it. It drives creativity and
productivity, and economic systems that deny this right result in
perverse effects that kill motivation, and quash personal pride with
often catastrophic results]{.underline}**. But no system is perfect.
Social and income inequality exist within capitalist societies as they
have existed in every other economic system that has been tried. It is
true that many people inherit wealth and that this gives them a head
start in life. It can be argued that this isn't fair and that would
probably be right; the reality is that life very often isn't fair. Not
everybody is equally talented or skilful. Likewise, not everybody is
presented with the same opportunities to succeed. Recall the Parable of
the Talents; the servant who buried his capital didn't have the skills
or drive necessary to make the capital work in a way that generated more
wealth. That is why, in most capitalist societies, provision is made for
people who, for whatever reason, are unable to thrive. Often this takes
the form of social welfare, or the 'safety net,' and is complemented by
private beneficent societies such as church groups and charities. But
the high cost of state-sponsored welfare and the deleterious effects of
intergenerational welfare dependency mean that alternatives need to be
found. Many ideas have been floated which seek to address social
inequality including the Universal Basic Income and [[work placement
subsidies]{.underline}](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674026940),
which are said to be largely self-financed by reductions in welfare and
crime. Cutting edge thinkers also [see opportunities in blockchain
technology](https://libertyworks.org.au/blockchain-based-universal-basic-income/),
which, through the creation of 'smart contracts,' allows people to
income swap in a way that does not require central planning or
administration. Any solutions that seek to address inequalities must be
carefully balanced against individual freedoms. As Milton Friedman so
eloquently stated, **["The society that puts equality before freedom
will end up with neither. The society that puts freedom before equality
will end up with a great measure of both." Other problems arise within
markets when large corporate entities lobby government to manipulate the
market in their favour through the use of regulations, subsidies, and
labour legislation. This influence then upsets market equilibrium
leading to shortages, surpluses, and monopolies.]{.underline}**
Governments also meddle in the market to protect certain enterprises
from collapsing; one well known example is the financial bailouts of
banks. This corporatism, or crony-capitalism, results in mis-management
and distortion of markets, along with intended and unintended negative
effects on the economy. Mega-corporations aided by government
regulations monopolise the market-place. Many of those who rightly
critique these unethical practices, wrongly blame capitalism and markets
themselves. The trouble is that governments in capitalist societies are
generally too large, and all too ready to bow to corporatist pressure,
and grant favours in exchange for political donations. Corporations then
find themselves in control of the levers of government. The problem
isn't that markets are too free, but that they are not free enough.
Corporatism is an argument against government and the corrupting
influence of power, *not* against capitalism and the marketplace. As
Thomas Jefferson so wisely said, "A wise and frugal government, which
shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise
free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and
shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned." Free
market capitalism and individualism grant us levels of freedom unheard
of in human history. Wealth creation is not a zero sum game. It is not
finite. We can't cut it up into little pieces and share them out evenly.
**[While building their own personal new wealth, billionaire
entrepreneurs are creating more wealth overall through job creation and
by providing value to consumers that enriches us all. Income inequality
may have increased, but a greater proportion of people than ever before
enjoy wealth that only two or three generations ago would have been
unfathomable. We need to be honest about the failings of human beings,
and to acknowledge that rather than causing these failings, capitalism
minimises their negative impact. We need also to remember the often
gruesome outcomes of collectivist alternatives. People who seek to
redress the inequality and dysfunction that prevails in our modern
societies are to be lauded, but vilifying capital and the free market is
misguided and attacks the very system that has enabled life to improve
for the vast majority of the global population.]{.underline}**

#### Even though capitalism isn't perfect, it's still better and more efficient than other possible systems

**Barnes 14** (Matt-Barnes, writer and editor for ThePittNews, 8/26/14,
"Capitalism: The worst economic system, except for all the others",

As the new year begins, students will again be exposed to minds that
assert the dangers and evils of capitalism. These thinkers have every
right to put forth such beliefs --- that is what America is all about.
But be weary of such cynicism. Instead, try thinking of the world's
predominant economic system in both a personal and rational manner. Then
you will understand its true value. As an American**[,]{.underline}** I
am incredibly fortunate to live in a nation whose economic tradition
centers around **[capitalism. It has made this nation prosperous and
provided me with opportunities unrealized in centrally planned economies
--- a thriving free market in which I am free to use my earned money as
I wish, enroll in the university I wish to attend and lead the life I
wish to lead --- unburdened by the dictates of inefficient and
ineffective central planning. All of this stems from the economic
freedom and choice that capitalism, not socialism or Marxism,
provides]{.underline}**. In a speech on Nov. 11, 1947, Sir Winston
Churchill reminded the UK's House of Commons that "democracy is the
worst form of government, except for all those others that have been
tried." In a similar fashion**[, capitalism is the worst economic
system, except for all the others. Capitalism is no different from
anything else in this world. It is imperfect because imperfect men
created it. Humans are not perfect, nor are they capable of perfection.
Avarice and greed are not unique to capitalism. They were present in the
USSR, and they will be present in any man-made system]{.underline}**.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, free market systems have been
implemented in numerous former Soviet States. Perhaps nowhere better
illustrates capitalism's success in post-Iron Curtain Europe than in the
country of Estonia. On Oct. 21, 1992, Mart Laar became Prime Minister of
the newly independent nation. He was only 32 years old. Upon entering
office, Laar's economic knowledge consisted of one book: 20th century
free market economist Milton Friedman's Free to Choose, a personal
statement advocating for the immense value of economic freedom. The
young prime minister was so impressed that he implemented many of
Friedman's ideas, such as [free markets and free
trade](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/08/the-estonian-economic-miracle).
Rather than borrowing huge amounts of money from international
institutions, Estonia sought to attract foreign investment. The most
northern Baltic nation prioritized real, natural growth over shallow,
artificial growth. Because of this, Estonia successfully transitioned
from a poverty-stricken nation with a planned economy to a flourishing
capitalist society. In fact, by the latter half of the 1990s, Estonia
received more foreign investment per capita than any other central or
eastern European country. Therefore, because of free markets and private
investment --- not central planning and public intervention --- new
workplaces formed, old factories were reconstructed and new knowledge
and technology were acquired, making Estonia authentically modern and
increasingly competitive. In 1992, Estonia's GDP per capita (in dollars)
was \$2,823. In only 20 years, [GDP per
capita](http://kushnirs.org/macroeconomics/gdp/gdp_estonia.html)
increased dramatically, totaling \$17,041 in 2012. Leaving Estonia and
entering China, one will find more corroboration for the case for
economic freedom.
[Globally](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim),
capitalism is responsible for lifting nearly one billion individuals out
of poverty in the past 20 years alone. China is responsible for
three-fourths of this achievement. Moreover, extreme poverty is
disappearing**[. Between 1981 and 2010, China elevated 680 million
people out of poverty and reduced its extreme poverty rate from 84
percent in 1980 to 10 percent today. Like Estonia, China has experienced
great economic liberalization leading to a vast influx of foreign
investment --- producing remarkable domestic growth and
opportunity]{.underline}**. As evidently displayed in practice, nations
that have focused on economic freedom, such as Estonia and China, have
significantly grown and developed. Regimes that focus purely on abstract
and utopian ideology, as those of Soviet Russia and Maoist China did,
fail to provide true progress and sustainability. As Friedman once said,
**["A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A
society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of
both." Government initiatives alone cannot solely bring about equality.
Equality must also derive from those governed. If the governed are not
granted freedom, no one can be equal --- for equality stems from freedom
--- and not the other way around. There is no question that capitalist
societies produce inequalities. A system based on freedom of choice with
reward based on merit is bound to yield different results in different
circumstances. It is this very quality that reflects capitalism's
natural effectiveness and practicality. It is the freedom to choose that
makes us human. It is the profit incentive that drives us to work our
hardest. It is our inherent and distinct ability to reason as
individuals, not as collectives, that makes us truly free. As Winston
Churchill once said, "The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal
sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal
sharing of miseries."]{.underline}** I will take the former over the
latter any day. I have made my choice. You are free to make yours.

Over the past few decades, **[technological]{.underline}**, governance,
and market **[progress has lifted an unprecedented number of people out
of poverty]{.underline}** (extreme poverty rate has declined from 36
percent in 1990 to an estimated at 8.6 percent in 2018)1 and delivered
incredible new economic opportunities. But, at the same time, this
progress has come at a real cost---growing inequalities (the world's
richest 26 people possess the same wealth as the poorest half of
humanity)2 and an increasingly dangerous degradation of the natural
resource base which supports life on earth and our economies. This
**[environmental degradation is starting to reverberate]{.underline}**
and affect **[economic growth. If unchecked, there is a real risk of
serious impacts on financial stability, and the welfare of people around
the world. Disasters triggered by weather- and climate-related hazards
were responsible for thousands of deaths]{.underline}** and \$320
billion in losses in 2017, and the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) special report "Global Warming of 1.5oC" raised
the alarm on the significant and potentially irreversible risks of a
changing climate. **[Water stress]{.underline}**, occurring when demand
exceeds supply, **[linked to climate change is already contributing to
migration, which in turn can lead to conflict and political
instability.]{.underline}** Today, outdoor air pollution kills an
estimated 4.2 million people annually according to the WHO. At the same
time, 2.1 billion live without readily available, safe water supplies at
home, and 4.5 billion live without safely managed sanitation.3 In the
past, many viewed environmental quality as a trade-off with economic
growth: any increase in environmental quality came at a cost or
slow-down in economic development prospects. As **[new clean
technologies have emerged]{.underline}** and their costs plummeted, it
has been increasingly clear that many **[green alternatives can be
cost-competitive. We can have both a clean environment and robust
growth.]{.underline}** More recently, evidence has shown that
**[sustained growth is, in fact, dependent on environmental
protection]{.underline}**, and the two must go together.4 The only
viable growth path is one that is low-carbon, resilient and sustainable.
The challenge now, we argue, is to accelerate the transformation to a
better, more inclusive, sustainable economy. This is especially urgent
in emerging economies, where growth is advancing most rapidly. These
countries are in the process of designing the cities, energy, food,
water, and transport systems of the future. The results will lock-in
growth paths for decades to come. **[Globally we have witnessed an
ability to produce and consume more efficiently and with less waste and
pollution in recent decades]{.underline}**. However, excessive
consumption by the rich along with growth in demand, especially from a
growing global middle class, has overwhelmed efficiency gains. To ensure
future sustainability and avoid intergenerational inequity, we need a
much more profound shift in how our economies interact with the
environment. In the coming decade, we have a window of opportunity to
make this transformation, given the major structural changes occurring
across the globe, including rapid urbanization, a growing global middle
class with changing consumption preferences, shifts to service-based
economies, and increasing automation. The question is: how do we seize
this opportunity with the urgency required to tackle the global climate
and environmental crisis? We have organized this chapter around four key
changes to economic policy and institutions that we believe are needed
to deliver a more inclusive and sustainable future: (1) how to measure
economic well-being; (2) how to manage consumption; (3) how to design
effective environmental policy; and (4) how to ensure government works
well with the private sector and more engaged citizens. We argue in this
chapter that environmental policymaking today is being informed by
policy and institutional choices that often deviate from original
notions of neoliberalism. Past writings on neoliberalism say little
about the environment, but we can infer some key directions or
principles: rely on the private sector and the market to solve
environmental problems; limit regulation as this distorts markets; grow
now and clean up later (as reflected in the Kuznets curve); and focus on
privatizing property rights. While some of these principles have played
a role in advancing environmental protection at the margins, new models
are urgently needed. We are rapidly approaching tipping points on inter
alia, land use change, freshwater use, biodiversity loss, and climate
change that could irreversibly affect growth and development pathways
for humanity. What gets measured, gets managed. This is true for how
governments measure the well-being of nations. Following the Bretton
Woods conference in 1944, gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the
size of economic production, became the default proxy for a country's
economic and general welfare. While it was never intended to measure
general well-being, neoliberals embraced GDP and growth as the sine qua
non for progress, based on the assumption that the more a country's
economic activity grows the better off its citizens become. GDP and an
affixation on growth has two limitations, however, that have become more
pronounced in recent decades. GDP does not account for how growth is
distributed or whether it is sustainable. First, the wealth distribution
challenge. With relatively evenly distributed wealth, strong investment
in public services, and high household economic security, GDP can be a
good yardstick. This was the case for many developed countries following
World War II. It is not the case today. Living standards have stagnated
or declined in many countries, even as their economies continued to
grow. Income inequality in developed economies is at its highest in
fifty years and while hundreds of millions have been lifted out of
poverty in emerging economies, such as China and India, the benefits of
growth have not been evenly shared, leading to rising income
inequality.5 In 2017, an estimated 82 percent of the wealth
createdglobally went to the top 1 percent of the world's population.6 A
narrow pursuit of economic growth as an end, rather than means, has for
many countries lead to inequity and economic insecurity. Second, the
interlinked sustainability challenge. GDP does not account for how
income is generated. It excludes the value of natural assets and the
cost of environmental externalities. A country can degrade its
agricultural land, cut down its forests and pollute its water, while
recording these activities as positive economic contributions.7 GDP does
not measure environmental degradation or depletion of natural assets
until these activities start to show up as economic costs, but by then
it can be too late to reverse, for examples, soil degradation, aquifer
depletion, and climate change. When GDP was first introduced, natural
resources, such as forests, fisheries, minerals, and fertile land were
abundant. This is no longer the case. Few economic models consider the
impact of environmental degradation in slowing or disrupting economic
growth, a feedback loop whose magnitude we are increasingly aware could
be significant. As we recognize the limitations of the neoliberal focus
on economic growth, the question is how then should a nation measure its
well-being? The correct answer is that it depends on a country's
context. But all countries should include metrics of equity and
sustainability. And the relationship between economic and environmental
goals need not be a trade-off. Win-wins or co-benefits are possible. In
the past 10-15 years China has strengthened national building codes for
commercial and residential buildings reducing energy costs (even after
taking into account the cost of financing) and greenhouse gas emissions
at the same time. India's sizable investments in renewable energy create
benefits for climate change and position India to take advantage of
growing markets for clean energy. Calls for metrics that go beyond GDP
are emerging. The 2009 Stiglitz Commission Report (Stiglitz, Sen, and
Fitoussi 2009), for example, highlighted GDP's limitations and called
for a dashboard of metrics that included wealth distribution and
sustainability. This spurred a flurry of efforts to create such metrics,
including OECD's Better Life Index, Green GDP, Doughnut approach, and
the Genuine Progress Indicator (see Box 1). The challenge is not a lack
of metrics, but how to create a dashboard small and focused enough to
resonate with policymakers, but large enough to include what matters
most to citizens. Despite various efforts to do so, many governments and
commentators continue to focus on GDP. The U.N. SDGs that all countries
have endorsed may help address the metrics challenge. SDGs measure what
GDP does not, including environmental health and equity. However, their
comprehensiveness (17 SDGs, 169 targets, and 232 indicators) is not
suited to providing the narrow dashboard needed by policymakers. To
address this, governments can engage citizens in prioritizing which SDGs
and targets are most relevant to their country's context. Some goals,
such as measures of employment, equity, and environmental health will
likely be applicable to all countries. Others, such as hunger and
education, may be more relevant to lower income countries. The selected
SDG goal priorities can be combined with the traditionally highly
watched GDP metric to form a single more rounded dashboard for measuring
well-being and progress. But concerted communication campaigns will be
needed to widen attention to these other metrics beyond GDP, to create
the political will to ensure they are mainstreamed, and to ensure they
"stick" over the long-term. Despite efforts to redefine growth beyond
economic well-being, GDP continues to be the most important metric to
the mainstream economic community. GDP growth hinges on consumption
growth, as consumer spending or consumption is often the largest
component of a country's GDP. Financial markets, business, and
policymakers all seek increased consumer spending, even though
consumption and the underlying production processes that support it
often drive natural resource depletion and environmental degradation.
Let's look at the food system, for example. Ruminant meat (beef, lamb,
and goat) is especially resource-intensive to produce, requiring 20
times more land and emitting 20 times more greenhouse gases (GHGs) per
gram of edible protein than alternative protein sources, such as beans,
peas and lentils.8 Consumption of ruminant meat globally is expected to
increase by 88 percent between 2010 and 2050. This will drive further
demand for pasture and feed, creating pressure to convert remaining
forests into agricultural land. The conversion of forests leads to
biodiversity loss and climate change through the release of carbon
stored in biomass.9 More broadly, the agriculture sector places the
largest demand on water (approximately 70 percent of global freshwater
withdrawals),10 and yet, water-intensive crops continue to be planted in
water-scarce areas. Other sectors such as energy, transport, and
manufacturing also can seriously impact the environment. According to
Rockstrom and Steffen,11 planetary boundaries which represent a "safe
operating space for humanity" have already been exceeded for
biodiversity and biochemical (nitrogen and phosphorus) flows and will
soon be breached for climate change and land system change. The
inability of national metrics such as GDP and corporate financial
accounting systems to account for the depletion of natural capital or
environmental costs (negative externalities) has contributed to
unsustainable production and consumption of resource-intensive and
environmentally-destructive goods and services. The projected rapid
growth of the global middle class from 3.6 billion in 2018 to 5.3
billion in 203012 will further exacerbate current environmental trends
unless consumption and the underlying production systems that support it
dramatically shift. **[This shift requires growing the market share of
goods and services that promote health and well-being, curbing excessive
consumption]{.underline}** (half of the world's population consumes 50
percent more protein than needed)13 **[and ensuring production systems
that enhance and restore rather than deplete the environmental and
natural resources that underpin long-term economic
health.]{.underline}** **[Three emerging shifts in the form and types of
consumption offer opportunities to reduce the
resource-intensity]{.underline}** and environmental impacts of the
economy: **[circular consumption, shared consumption, and substitute
consumption]{.underline}**. Circular consumption encompasses **[reusing
materials at the end of their life]{.underline}**, rather than disposing
of them, **[eliminating waste and pollution]{.underline}** in product
design, keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible,
and regenerating natural systems.14 Procter & Gamble,15 for example, has
announced the first-ever fully recyclable shampoo bottle made from
recycled beach plastic. Guangzhou Huadu, a Southern Chinese company,
remanufactures gearboxes and other automotive transmission systems
recapturing the value- added component of the original product rather
than landfilling or recycling it.16 Shared consumption involves sharing
an asset that would otherwise be under-utilized. Examples include
renting out homes (Airbnb) ride services (Uber), and clothes (Y Closet).
Substitute consumption involves replacing an environmentally impactful
product or service with one that provides the same or similar function,
but with less environmental impact. For example, shifting transportation
from private vehicles to public transit services such as bus and rail,
and non-motorized services such as bicycles can reduce the environmental
impact per passenger mile traveled. Likewise, the substitution of
plant-based diets instead of meat- heavy diets can create health and
environmental benefits. The private sector, for example, is developing
plant-based products that mimic the taste, texture, and experience of
consuming beef or milk. Food service companies such as Sonic and Sodexo
are reducing beef consumption by substituting new product lines such as
the blended burger that blend mushrooms and beef, reducing environmental
impacts and calories.17 **[Evolving social norms and policies are
helping to redirect production]{.underline}** and consumption **[in ways
that are]{.underline}** more **[environmentally
sustainable.]{.underline}** Approaches to sustainable production and
consumption, however, may not always lead to aggregate increases in
conventionally defined consumption or GDP, reinforcing the need to shift
beyond GDP metrics as discussed in the previous section. Complementing
market-based instruments with regulations and other policy instruments
**[The importance of taxing activities that generate negative
externalities to correct for market- failures]{.underline}** and enhance
economic efficiency started with discussion of Pigouvian taxes in 1920
by Arthur Pigou, and was further advanced with respect to taxing
pollution by William Baumol in 1972. Neoliberal economists have strongly
emphasized the importance of market-based instruments as the most
efficient approach to tackling air and water pollution, GHG emissions,
and other negative environmental impacts of economic activity including
the over- use of common resources (water, fisheries, biodiversity, etc).
The suggestion by many economists has been that, if these market
failures are corrected, an optimal level of pollution reduction or
resource use will be achieved. There has been progress in the use of
market-based instruments in recent decades. For example, **[the number
of carbon-pricing systems implemented or planned has quadrupled over the
past 10 years]{.underline}**, now covering over 74 jurisdictions and
about 20 percent of GHG emissions globally (See Box 2).18 \[Begin Box
2\] Despite mainstream economists advocating for carbon pricing since
the 1970s, progress was slow on their uptake until recently. **[Major
recent developments in 2017 and 2018 included the launch of the Chinese
national emissions trading system and the introduction of new carbon
taxes in Chile and Colombia, as well as increased prices or tightened
caps in existing carbon-pricing systems]{.underline}**. A pan-Canadian
carbon price will be implemented in 2019, and carbon taxes will come
into force in Argentina, Singapore, and South Africa. Factors that have
helped drive the spread of carbon pricing include: **[mounting evidence
that early carbon pricing experiences have not hampered
growth]{.underline}**, contrary to early skepticism; political interest
in the revenues it can provide; and **[increasing support by the private
sector, concerned about the growing threats of climate change to their
business model]{.underline}**. \[End Box 2\] Increasingly, however, the
limitations of a singular focus on market-based instruments has become
clear to many economists. The right question is not whether to use a
price-based instrument or a regulatory or other policy instrument, but
instead how these might be optimally combined for efficiency and
effectiveness. Major institutions promoting the use of market-based
instruments---such as the OECD, the IMF and the World Bank---have
recognized in recent years that they are most effective when used in a
broader policy package. This includes important roles played by: (1)
standards and regulations (e.g. building efficiency or fuel efficiency
standards), in particular where price signals may not reach the right
decision-makers or take too long to shift investment or behavioral
choices; (2) investments in R&D and innovation to help bring down the
costs of environmental-friendly technologies to spur their deployment;
and (3) information-based instruments, such as energy or water
efficiency labels on appliances that can inform consumer choices and
accentuate the effect of pricing. Behavioral economics has found that
individuals do not always react rationally to a price alone, and an
additional "nudge" can significantly enhance behavior. For example,
combining water or energy pricing with notices indicating how a given
household compares to neighbors in terms of efficiency savings can
significantly boost incentives to enhance efficiency, well beyond what
the price alone will do. An important recent development in the
classical neoliberal focus on market-based instruments to achieve
environment policies has been a recognition of the need for accompanying
measures to manage social and competitiveness effects. In terms of
industrial competitiveness concerns,19 there is little evidence of any
impacts of environmental policies on cross-country competitiveness, and
has been a major block to policy action in many countries. As a result,
for example, most carbon pricing schemes either exempt or offer special
provisions for trade-exposed energy-intensive industries. As prices
increase, and carbon or other environmental pricing continues to spread
to other counties, finding approaches to include these sectors in
environmental action through pricing or other policy measures will be
essential, in particular as they are often the most polluting sectors.
In terms of the distributional impacts, **[there is building evidence of
how environmental policies]{.underline}**, in particular pricing
instruments or reforms of distorting subsidies, **[can be implemented in
a way that consciously works to reduce social inequities]{.underline}**,
rather than exacerbating them.20 These efforts build on successful
examples of redistributing the revenues of carbon pricing systems to
support affected households, such as with the British Columbia carbon
tax that has ensured low-income households are better off than they
would have been without the carbon tax.21 Approaches to ensure a just
transition to a low-carbon and sustainable energy economy through social
dialogue are emerging in various countries, including in Alberta, Canada
where carbon price revenues were allocated to support the transition for
coal communities, and in China where a \$15 billion fund was established
to help fund the retraining, reallocation and early retirement of
workers affected by managing over-capacity in the coal and steel
sectors. Other examples include socially progressive water pricing
schemes.22 However, much progress is still needed: \$373 billion23 is
still provided in fossil fuel subsidies globally each year, effectively
working against carbon pricing, as well as over \$500 billion in
subsidies to agriculture each year, which exacerbate challenges in
better land use and water management.24 A perennial question confronting
policymakers is clarifying the appropriate roles of the state, private
sector and civil society in most effectively addressing environmental
problems. Neoliberal principles would encourage a limited role for
government and a reliance on market signals to tackle externalities.
However, the nature and urgency of environmental crises point to the
need for more ambitious and concerted effort by both the public and
private sectors than would happen otherwise. In earlier sections, we
remarked on the critical role of the government in developing more
comprehensive metrics to measure economic progress, in helping redirect
production and consumption and in pricing or regulating environmental
externalities (e.g., air pollution, water pollution, congestion),
eliminating wasteful subsidies (e.g., fossil fuels, agriculture) and
providing incentives for more sustainable investments (e.g., renewable
energy). In this section, we share reflections on key roles that
government will need to assume if we are to successfully tackle growing
environmental challenges. • Accelerating investment in sustainable
infrastructure. Approximately two-thirds of the investments in
infrastructure in developing and emerging countries, which often has
significant impacts on the environment, is provided by public
resources.25 Governments and development financial institutions need to
strengthen national and sub-national policy frameworks and institutional
capacities to deliver more inclusive, sustainable infrastructure.
Greater attention is being given to build pipelines of viable projects
and reduce high development and transaction costs in order to attract
private investment at scale. Globally, investments in infrastructure are
likely to double to \$90 trillion between 2015 and 2030.26 We need to
get this infrastructure investment right to avoid unsustainable lock-in
for decades to come. The next five years is a critical "use it or lose
it" window of opportunity, as this is when many of the policy and
investment decisions that shape the next 10-15 years will be taken (see
Box 3 on China's Belt and Road Initiative). • Stimulating innovation.
Another distinct role for government is to ramp up investments in
technology R&D and deployment to reduce the costs and enhance the
accessibility of sustainable technologies. Well-designed innovation
policy has helped drive down the costs of renewable energy (e.g., wind
and solar), which in turn has accelerated the low carbon energy
transition. China, for example, identifies "strategic emerging
industries" that officials believe will be critical to delivering
China's five-year national development plans. Energy efficient and
environmental technologies topped the list during China's 12th Five-Year
Plan (2011-2015). India has identified solar-based technologies as a
comparative advantage and has set a highly ambitious solar power target
along with corresponding policies and incentives to stimulate investment
in solar power generation. India has also co-founded the International
Solar Alliance to support other countries in deploying solar energy.
Similar attention to innovation needs to be given to other environmental
challenges such as developing heat-resistant and drought-resistant crop
varieties that are able to withstand a changing climate or technologies
to reduce agriculture-related emissions such as from rice and livestock
production. • Managing just transitions. For governments to facilitate a
more sustainable development trajectory, it is critical that the
distribution of socio-economic benefits and costs are carefully
understood and managed in a fair manner. Developing countries, for
example, have an opportunity to leapfrog the inefficient and polluting
energy models of the past by embracing a low-carbon transition. But to
succeed, governments will need to work with energy companies, trade
unions, and civil society to ensure a just transition for workers and
communities dependent on fossil-based energy systems for their
livelihoods. Examples of approaches that can help ensure such a just
transition are emerging from Canada, Uruguay, Scotland, China, Germany,
and elsewhere.27 The central message is **[that government will need to
play a more active role in facilitating the transition to more
sustainable energy, urban, food and land use, and water systems than
they have in the past]{.underline}**. But this should be seen in the
broader context that the private sector must also play an indispensable
role in these transitions. Large multinational companies are
increasingly aware of the significance of global sustainability risks.
In the 2018 World Economic Forum Global Risks Perception Survey, the top
four global risks are environment or climate related: extreme weather
events, natural disasters, climate change, water crises.28 This reflects
a profound shift from the top global risks identified a decade ago by
the world's business and political leaders. In response, **[large
companies, including from the developing world, are making ambitious
sustainability commitments]{.underline}**. For example, **[over 500
companies, representing approximately \$7 trillion in market value and
with collective emissions equivalent to Canada, have committed to
setting science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}**. Approximately 12 percent of these companies
are headquartered in the developing world. **[Companies
are]{.underline}** also **[leveraging]{.underline}** their **[supply
chains to accelerate such shifts. The Consumer Goods Forum, a global
industry group of retailers and manufacturers, made a public commitment
to achieve zero-net deforestation by 2020]{.underline}** through the
sustainable sourcing of key commodities like soy, palm oil, cattle and
paper and pulp. Also important is the need to shift private capital
towards more sustainable investments. The Investor Agenda, the largest
climate investor alliance globally, represents nearly 400 investors that
collectively manage \$32 trillion in assets, and was developed to scale
up actions critical to tackling climate change and to achieve the goals
of the Paris Agreement on climate change.29 What we are observing is no
longer an unwavering belief that that the market will solve major
environmental challenges alone, but **[that government has an
indispensable role to help channel and accelerate action by the private
sector]{.underline}**. The focus now is in constructing the right
interface between the two. We are also witnessing other **[public and
private actors such as subnational governments]{.underline}** (cities
and provinces/states), supply chains and multi-stakeholder alliances
coming together to tackle these challenges. Given that we are fast
approaching environmental thresholds and tipping points, encouraging
leadership from wherever it may emerge, in the hope that it stimulates
leadership from others, is critical.

### Cap Good - Innovation

#### Capitalism has fundamentally improved standards of life through innovation and progress

**Pethokoukis 16** (James-Pethokoukis; columnist, policy analyst,
writer, editor, and Dewitt Wallace Fellow at the AEI, 2/9/16, "Don't

better. Here's how",
http://www.aei.org/publication/dont-tell-bernie-sanders-but-capitalism-has-made-human-life-fantastically-better-heres-how/)

Back in 1995, now-Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said,
"I personally happen not to be a great believer in the free enterprise
system for many reasons." And having watched Sanders during this primary
season, it doesn't appear to me that the self-described democratic
socialist has much changed his opinion of capitalism. Which is both
amazing and appalling. **[The [single greatest story of human
achievement](https://www.aei.org/publication/the-most-important-economic-chart-in-western-civilization-and-how-it-happened/)
of the past 2,000 years is the dramatic rise in living standards of the
past 200 years. It's an astounding ascent --- see above chart --- driven
by innovative, entrepreneurial capitalism]{.underline}**. Free
enterprise. Economic freedom. Yes, workers in advanced economies today
are many multiples wealthier --- almost incalculably so --- than their
counterparts in the early 19th century. But here is another way of
looking at, thanks to [a new
study](http://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/finance/articles/technology-and-people.html)
by consultancy Deloitte showing how technology-driving innovation has
radically altered lives in Britain for the much better: **[1) Technology
has created more jobs than it has destroyed in the last 144
years.]{.underline}** 2) It has been saving us from dull, repetitive,
and dangerous work. Agriculture was the first major sector to experience
this change. In 1871 it employed 6.6% of the workforce of England and
Wales. Today that stands at 0.2%, a 95% decline. **[3) Overall,
technological innovation has resulted in fewer humans being deployed as
sources of muscle power and more engaged in jobs involving the nursing
and care of others. Just 1.1% of the workforce was employed in the
caring professions during the 1871 census. By 2011, these professions
employed almost a quarter of the England and Wales workforce. 4)
Technology has boosted employment in knowledge-intensive sectors such as
medicine, accounting and professional services. 5) Finally technology
has lowered the cost of essentials, raising disposable incomes and
creating new demand and jobs.]{.underline}** In 1871, there was one
hairdresser for every 1,793 English and Welsh citizens; now there is one
for every 287. In 1948, a Freed-Eiseman 16-inch TV cost \$795 in the US,
roughly a quarter of the average annual salary, or roughly \$12,000
today. A top of the range TV can be bought today for less than \$1,000.
On a quality-adjusted basis, the decline in prices is even more
pronounced. US CPI data show that the price of a TV has fallen by 98%
since 1950. So thanks to the technology-driven innovation of
entrepreneurial capitalism, we live richer, fuller lives that would be
unimaginable to workers in the early 1800s or even later 1800s.

has written: **[Over the past two centuries, growth has increased living
standards in the West unimaginably quickly. Many more babies survive to
adulthood. Many more adults survive to old age.]{.underline}** Many more
people can be fed, clothed and housed. Much of the world enjoys
significant quantities of leisure time. Much of the world can carve out
decades of their lives for education, skill development and the moral
formation and enlightenment that come with it. Growth has enabled this.
Let's keep growing. ... Growth facilitates the flourishing life. By
creating a dynamic environment characterized by increasing opportunity,
growth gives the young the opportunity to dream and to strive. **[And it
gives the rest of us the ability to apply our skills and talents as we
see fit, to contribute to society, to provide for our families. A
growing economy allows individuals to increase their living standards,
facilitating economic and social mobility. How could anyone not be a
great believer in competitive, market-driven capitalism?]{.underline}**

### Cap Good - Self Correcting

#### Capitalism's self-correcting mechanisms and adaptability makes it sustainable now and into the future 

**Illing and Pearlstein 19** \[Sean Illing and Steven Pearlstein; Sean
Illing is a former professor of politics and philosophy at Louisiana
State University; Steven Pearlstein is a business and economics
columnist who writes about local, national and international topics at
the Washington Post; 1/2/19;"Is Capitalism Worth Saving?";
<https://www.vox.com/2019/1/2/18130630/american-capitalism-neoliberalism-steven-pearlstein>\]

I'm not so sure that the people at the top are starting to see it that
way, but we'll come back to that. First, tell me [what went wrong in the
1970s and '80s, when]{.underline} you say [capitalism really started to
go sideways.]{.underline} Steven Pearlstein Two things happened during
the '70s and '80s. [First, the American industrial economy lost its
competitiveness. Neoliberal policies of global free trade and
unregulated markets were embraced, and the US was suddenly facing
competition from all over the globe.]{.underline} So American companies,
which had been so dominant in our own market and in foreign markets,
started to lose their dominance, and they had to get leaner and meaner.
They started behaving in different ways. They started sharing less
profits with their employees and with shareholders and customers.
Eventually, that produced a revolt from shareholders, and in the
mid-'80s we had the first of what were called "hostile takeovers," in
which people would come in and buy up large chunks of companies and
threaten to take them over or out the executives if they didn't put
shareholders above all else. [The result of all this was that companies
changed how they did business and completely embraced the idea that
companies should be run to maximize shareholder value and nothing else.
Obviously, that meant more money for executives and shareholders and
less money for employees and customers. This is the mentality that led
us to the place we're in now.]{.underline} "THIS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE
SYSTEM, AND IF IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE, WE RUN THE RISK OF A REVOLUTION"
Sean Illing I want to push you on what I think is an excessively
sanguine view of capitalism. In the book, you imply [that capitalism has
gone off the rails, but I disagree.]{.underline} I'd argue that
capitalism has evolved in precisely the way we should have expected it
to evolve. The culture of norms and values that were supposed to check
the excesses of capitalism has (predictably) been eroded by capitalism
itself, and now it's propelled entirely by greed. You seem to think that
[capitalism can be saved from itself.]{.underline} What do you say to
people who think it's not salvageable, not morally legitimate, and in
any case not worth salvaging? Steven Pearlstein T[he question is, is all
of that endemic to capitalism?]{.underline} I don't think so, because
[we see different kinds of capitalism in countries in, say, Northern
Europe and in Germany. Some of that has to do with the rules and laws
under which they operate, but a lot of it has to do with the norms of
behavior. So capitalism doesn't have to reach the point of ruthlessness
like it has here and other places. And **one of the good things about
capitalism is that it has self-correcting mechanisms, just as democracy
has self-correcting mechanisms.**]{.underline} The truth is that the
outcome we have now, all of this tremendous inequality, is bad morally
and economically. This is not a sustainable system, and if it keeps
getting worse, we run the risk of a revolution. So [I don't think
capitalism is an inherently moral system or an inherently self-defeating
system, but we have to ensure that it adapts when it veers too far into
corruption and inequality.]{.underline} And that's basically what I'm
calling for in this book. Sean Illing Well, yes, **[capitalist systems
are extremely adaptable]{.underline}** (that's definitely one thing Karl
Marx got really, really wrong), but the problem is that our system isn't
adapting, or not adapting fast enough. And we live in a media culture in
which nearly half the population is fed propaganda that convinces them
that immigrants and regulations are what are holding them back, not
greedy corporations. [How do we course-correct in the face of all this
confusion?]{.underline} Steven Pearlstein [We do it by changing norms,
and by talking about it and discussing it. That's how a democracy goes
about it. Now one of the questions you might ask is, how do norms
change?]{.underline} And the answer is, I don't know. But in the [#MeToo
movement](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/10/9/17933746/me-too-movement-metoo-brett-kavanaugh-weinstein),
we see a very good example of how norms can change very quickly. [What
was acceptable five years ago is really not acceptable anymore. And it's
because enough people got morally outraged and things changed. That's
how norms shift and the culture evolves.]{.underline} Sean Illing I'll
circle back to the #MeToo comparison because I think it's a bad one, but
there are also legal and structural impediments here. We have a
political system fueled by private money, which means that wealth
translates to political influence, which in turn means the laws are
increasingly rigged to benefit the people on top. Steven Pearlstein You
make a very good point, and in the book I say the No. 1 thing we have to
do is get money out of politics --- and that will probably require a
constitutional amendment. But you're right: We can't reform our economic
system if we don't reform our political financing system. As it is now,
we're stuck in a vicious cycle in which concentration of wealth leads to
concentration of political power, which leads to yet more concentration
of wealth. And we know how this plays out in the long run --- it leads
to revolution. But we don't have to get anywhere near that if we can
make the changes we need to make now. The Democratic Party will have to
lead the way, and if they really want to do that, they need to put this
at the top of their agenda and run on it. People out there are angry,
and this will help them win. It's a slam-dunk issue, really. People are
as disgusted by what they're seeing as you and I are. Sean Illing I want
to quote something interesting from your book: "Liberal critics never
miss an opportunity to complain about the level of inequality, but
they've rarely been willing to say what level, or what kinds, of
inequality would be morally acceptable." I have my own answer to this,
but I'm curious what you think the acceptable level of inequality is.
Steven Pearlstein My answer has to do with something called social
capital, which is a social science term that generally refers to the
amount of trust that we all have in each other and in our institutions.
And when things get so unfair that that trust becomes eroded, that's
when you know you've gone too far. That's when you know that things have
become too unequal. Another way that you would know it is when you see
class mobility, intergenerational class mobility, start to decline. Now,
we've only been in this neoliberal paradigm for 40 years, so it's a
little too early to know what the intergenerational data will look like,
but we can already see the gross inequalities and the erosion of social
capital. That, to me, is enough of a warning sign. [We know enough to
know we have to course-correct or risk disaster. "THE SYSTEM OFFENDS THE
MORAL SENSIBILITIES EVEN OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM
IT"]{.underline} Sean Illing In the book, you catalogue all of these
solutions to the problem --- [more income redistribution, better tax
reform, something like a]{.underline} [universal basic
income](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15364546/universal-basic-income-review-stern-murray-automation)[,
a new social contract between business and society, more access to
higher education, etc.]{.underline} --- and I agree with most of it. But
I'm not confident we have the political will to get these things done.
If I'm right about that, what do you think is going to happen in the
short to medium term? Steven Pearlstein [First]{.underline}, let me just
say that **[it will be easier to do these sorts of things than it will
be to go full socialist. If we lack the political will to fix the kind
of capitalism we have, then there's surely a higher political barrier to
the full socialist model of national health insurance, free college for
everybody, and guaranteed income for every individual, whether they work
or not.]{.underline}** So if you're saying that [things have to get
worse before they get better, you may be right. However, if you look at
public opinion polls, if you look at the recent election, I think the
will may be already there.]{.underline} Again, I see the success of the
#MeToo movement as a great example of what's possible.

### Cap Good - Resilient

#### Capitalism is the most resilient economic system

**Chang 11** (Ha-Joon Chang, is a South Korean institutional economist,
specialising in development economics. Currently a reader in the
Political Economy of Development at the University of Cambridge ,
October 18, 2011 "The defenders of capitalism should have more faith"
https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/the-defenders-of-capitalism-should-have-more-faith-response-by-ha-joon-chang-and-me-to-critics-of-the-robin-hood-tax/)

With European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso putting his
weight behind it, a generalised financial transaction tax (FTT) --- once
a pipe dream of the radical fringe --- has become an imminent reality.
Several of the most influential countries are expected to endorse the
idea at the Group of 20 (G-20) finance ministers' meeting today and
tomorrow and at the G-20 summit next month. The Republic of Korea, South
Africa, Brazil and India should be among them. The critics are howling
that this will hurt all of us, by reducing our ability to generate
wealth and employment. They say we cannot afford this at a time when we
are suffering from one of capitalism's biggest crises. **[We say these
people should have more faith in capitalism. Despite all its faults,
capitalism has proved the most resilient economic system humanity has
invented. It has survived numerous changes, many of which people
believed would destroy it]{.underline}**. **[It has disappointed its
left-wing critics by surviving the rise of the dispossessed working
class and three centuries of cyclical economic crises, which Karl Marx
predicted would grow bigger until they finally destroyed the system.
But, more interestingly, it has also baffled its supposed defenders by
its capacity to survive threats they thought would be terminal. They
include the eight- hour day, minimum wage, regulation of child labour,
progressive income tax, the welfare state, mass nationalisation of
industries, trading standards, environmental standards, and even the
introduction of the limited liability company (which many early
free-market economists, including Adam Smith, denounced as a dangerous
licence to take excessive risk). In fact, capitalism has not only
survived these changes but often improved itself by upwardly adjusting
to them]{.underline}**. So, for example, while many people warned that
the abolition of child labour would, by eliminating nearly half the
labour force, spell doom, it has actually made capitalism more dynamic
by generating a healthier and better educated workforce. The FTT is not
some arbitrary tax on, say, white asparagus or Henning Mankell novels,
which has no compensating benefits. Yes, there will be some immediate
costs of the FTT, in terms of particular trading activities "migrating"
to other jurisdictions with no FTT and thereby reducing tax revenue and
employment. However, in the long run, the compensating benefits will be
far greater. The FTT is meant to clamp down on the most speculative
elements of the global financial system, which has become the proverbial
tail wagging the dog of the global economy. The tax will reduce the
systemic instability created by big finance, thereby encouraging
long-term investment and more stable consumer demands, not to speak of
reducing unnecessary economic dislocation. It will make capitalism
better. Of course, the introduction of the FTT is only the beginning.
First, we need to decide how to use the money. The European Commission's
initial effort to grab the lot to fund its own operations raised howls
of protest, and the latest proposal backs down somewhat, leaving the
matter open. Bill Gates argues for "a substantial allocation for
development", as well as pushing G-20 governments not to backtrack on
their aid promises. "Rich countries' fiscal books cannot be balanced off
the backs of the poor," he says. Emerging powers should be making these
arguments even more forcefully. The FTT should not be seen as just an
easy way to collect more taxes, exploiting the public sentiment against
the financial sector. Moreover, the introduction of the FTT, even if it
can be done globally, should not be the end of attempts to regulate
global finance in a way that encourages economic dynamism and stability.
We have made progress raising capital requirements for banks but we
still need to properly regulate derivative products, change rules on
corporate takeovers, better supervise rating agencies and accounting
firms, and clamp down on tax havens. The FTT's time has come. **[Those
who try to argue against it on the grounds that it will do more harm
than good, or even cripple the capitalist system, are either ignorant or
self-serving. If capitalism has survived, and often flourished, with the
help of all the changes listed above, it will shrug off the FTT with
ease. In fact, it is most likely to use the FTT as an incentive to
improve itself.]{.underline}** The defenders of capitalism should have
more faith in it.

#### Capitalism is resilient because of its ability to adapt and innovate

**Brown 18** ( Anna Waldman-Brown, is Research Associate, Work of the
Future Task Force, MIT, Feb 3 2018, "Why is American Capitalism so
Resilient?",
https://medium.com/@Annawab/why-is-american-capitalism-so-resilient-e3790058efce)

**[Following the wide range of socioeconomic models that can still be
defined as "capitalism," one of the reasons why capitalism has proved so
resilient is its ability to take different forms to adapt to different
contexts. Scandinavia, for example, has high public spending and many
socialized services, and yet maintains a free market economy across
other sectors]{.underline}**. Although a staunch liberal such as
Friedman would protest that the Scandinavian system does not allow for
enough market freedoms, most economists would acknowledge that
Scandinavia has remained fundamentally capitalist in spite of expansive
government interference; Polanyi would even argue that Scandinavia's
relative stability and happiness is a direct result of government
restrictions on the free market. **[The wide variety of potential
capitalist structures also allows governments considerable flexibility
in mitigating financial crises --- thus increasing both the resilience
and popularity of capitalism. While the liberal paradigm views the
stability of capitalism as an endogenous feature of the free market, the
sociological paradigm attributes this stability to the existence of
non-market forces --- which can promote spending, cause inflation or
deflation, protect society through regulations, and affect the rate of
societal change. A capitalist society in crisis can re-stabilize its
economy through substantial interference in the free market without
destroying the fundamental tenets of capitalism. Polanyi (1944) points
out that the rate at which social change occurs can be just as important
as the change itself --- "but while the latter frequently does not
depend upon our volition, it is the rate at which we allow change to
take place which may well depend upon us."]{.underline}** Thus, Polanyi
celebrates England's process of slowing down the social degradation
caused by enclosures in the 17th century. **[One reason for the
resilience of capitalism is the human ability to innovate, proven by the
history of civilization thus far. In addition to international
expansion, capitalist firms have survived slumps in the past by finding
new, more creative avenues for growth. Although many emerging economies
tend to grow most rapidly during their early stages of
industrialization, capitalist nations have nonetheless found ways to
sustain themselves after all basic needs are met and all infrastructure
has been fully developed. Firms in developed nations have focused their
efforts on innovation, developing and bringing new technologies to
market to satisfy desires that citizens never knew they had. Thus, we
have met capitalism's insatiable drive for growth by regularly
developing new technologies --- from steam engines to the Internet ---
that would seem impossible to previous generations.]{.underline}** Many
technologists believe that human ingenuity can never be entirely
outsourced to machines. Furthermore, humanity may eventually grow beyond
the constraints of our finite planet, and move out to the stars through
asteroid-mining and extraterrestrial colonies. Nonetheless, even if we
continue to invent new investment opportunities ad infinitum, we must
still grapple with the satiability of humans ourselves --- a fact that
has hitherto been avoided through the collective creation of and belief
in the capitalist mythos.

### Cap Good - Climate Change/ Militarism

#### Capitalism is capable of adapting to crisis - even climate change wont end capitalism

**Keucheyan 2014** (Razmig Keucheyan, is an assistant professor in
sociology at the University of Paris-Sorbonne and the author of The Left
Hemisphere, 6 march 2014, "Not even climate change will kill off
capitalism",
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/06/not-even-climate-change-will-kill-off-capitalism)

**[Arguably the single most important mistake the revolutionary
movements of the 60s and 70s made was to overlook the resilience of
capitalism. The idea -- catastrophism, as it is often called -- that the
system was going to crumble under the pressure of its own
contradictions, that the bourgeoisie produces its own \"gravediggers\"
(as Marx and Engels put it in the Communist Manifesto) has been
disproved. When the rate of profit started showing signs of decline in
the first half of the 70s, the redistributive policies implemented after
the second world war were terminated and the neoliberal revolution was
launched. This resilience of capitalism has little to do with the
dominant classes being particularly clever or far-sighted. In fact, they
can keep on making mistakes -- yet capitalism still
thrives]{.underline}**. Why? Capitalism has created a world of great
complexity since its birth. **[Yet at its core, it is based on a set of
simple mechanisms that can easily adapt to adversity. This is a kind of
\"generative grammar\" in Noam Chomsky\'s sense: a finite set of rules
can generate an infinity of outcomes.]{.underline}** The context today
is very different from that of the 60s and 70s. The global left,
however, is in danger of committing the same error of underestimating
capitalism all over again. **[Catastrophism, this time, takes the form
of investing faith in a new object: climate change, and more generally
the ecological crisis. There is a worryingly widespread belief in
leftwing circles that capitalism will not survive the environmental
crisis. The system, so the story goes, has reached its absolute limits:
without natural resources -- oil among them -- it can\'t function, and
these resources are fast depleting; the growing number of ecological
disasters will increase the cost of maintaining infrastructures to
unsustainable levels; and the impact of a changing climate on food
prices will induce riots that will make societies
ungovernable.]{.underline}** The beauty of catastrophism, today as in
the past, is that if the system is to crumble under the weight of its
own contradictions, the weakness of the left ceases to be a problem. The
end of capitalism takes the form of suicide rather than murder. So the
absence of a murderer -- that is, an organised revolutionary movement --
doesn\'t really matter any more**[. But the left would be better off
learning from its past mistakes. Capitalism might well be capable not
only of adapting to climate change but of profiting from it. One hears
that the capitalist system is confronted with a double crisis: an
economic one that started in 2008, and an ecological one, rendering the
situation doubly perilous. But one crisis can sometimes serve to solve
another. Capitalism is responding to the challenge of the ecological
crisis with two of its favourite weapons: financialisation and
militarisation. In times of crisis, for instance, markets will require
simultaneously that wages be cut and that people keep consuming. Opening
the flow of credit allows the reconciliation of these two contradictory
injunctions -- at least until the next financial crisis.]{.underline}**
As Costas Lapavitsas has recently shown, finance has penetrated every
nook and cranny of our everyday lives: housing, health, education, even
nature. Carbon markets, weather or biodiversity derivatives, catastrophe
bonds, among others, belong to a new variety of \"environmental
finance\" products. Each one has its own specific way of functioning,
but their overall purpose is to alleviate or spread the rising costs of
climate change and the super-exploitation of the environment. For
instance, catastrophe bonds -- or \"cat bonds\" -- are not linked to
future investment, as traditional government or private bonds are, but
to the possible occurrence of a catastrophe, say, an earthquake in
Japan, or the continuing floods in the UK, whose cost to the insurance
industry is estimated at about £3bn. A government issues a \"cat bond\"
to gather funds. In return, it pays an attractive interest rate to the
investors. If a catastrophe occurs, the government keeps the money to
rebuild infrastructures or compensate victims. If it doesn\'t, the
investors eventually get their money back (and they keep the interest).
With the growing number of natural disasters due to climate change, the
sums spent by governments on catastrophe management have risen to
unprecedented levels. In some regions, this has put public budgets in
jeopardy. **[The financialisation of catastrophe insurance is supposed
to keep budgets balanced. It remains to be seen if this is a sustainable
response to the threat. But, from the point of view of the system, it
may well be. With financialisation comes the second capitalist response
to the ecological crisis: militarisation. Since the second half of the
last decade, all major armies of the world have published detailed
reports on the military consequences of climate change. Among the
different sectors of the ruling classes, the military is the one that
takes the environmental crisis most seriously -- the environment is a
crucial parameter in war-making. Clausewitz\'s On War, the greatest
military treatise ever written, explains the importance of the
\"terrain\". So whether]{.underline}** and to what extent environmental
parameters start changing matters greatly to the military. A report
published in the US in 2007, titled National Security and the Threat of
Climate Change -- created by, among others, 11 three- and four-star
admirals and generals -- defines climate change as a \"threat
multiplier\" that will intensify existing menaces. For instance, by
further weakening \"failed states\" it will make it easier for
terrorists to find refuge on their territory. Or by provoking climate
migration, it will destabilise the regions where the migrants arrive and
exacerbate ethnic conflicts. The US army, the report concludes, should
adapt its tactics and equipment to a changing environment. L**[ike
financialisation, militarisation is about reducing risk and creating a
physical and social environment favourable to capitalist
accumulation.]{.underline}** They are a kind of \"antibody\" that the
system secretes when a menace looms. This doesn\'t necessarily take the
form of shocks of the sort described by Naomi Klein in her book The
Shock Doctrine: it is a more gradual process that slowly takes hold of
every aspect of social life. Nothing in the system\'s logic will make it
go away. A world of environmental desolation and conflict will work for
capitalism, as long as the conditions for investment and profit are
guaranteed. And, for this, good old finance and the military are ready
to serve. Building a revolutionary movement that will put a stop to this
insane logic is therefore not optional. Because, if the system can
survive, it doesn\'t mean that lives worth living will. As the crisis
escalates... ... in our natural world, we refuse to turn away from the
climate catastrophe and species extinction. For The Guardian, reporting
on the environment is a priority. We give reporting on climate, nature
and pollution the prominence it deserves, stories which often go
unreported by others in the media. At this pivotal time for our species
and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats,
consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political
prejudice or business interests. More people are reading and supporting
The Guardian's independent, investigative journalism than ever before.
And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that
allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where
they live or what they can afford. But we need your ongoing support to
keep working as we do. The Guardian will engage with the most critical
issues of our time -- from the escalating climate catastrophe to
widespread inequality to the influence of big tech on our lives. At a
time when factual information is a necessity, we believe that each of
us, around the world, deserves access to accurate reporting with
integrity at its heart. Our editorial independence means we set our own
agenda and voice our own opinions. Guardian journalism is free from
commercial and political bias and not influenced by billionaire owners
or shareholders. This means we can give a voice to those less heard,
explore where others turn away, and rigorously challenge those in power.
We need your support to keep delivering quality journalism, to maintain
our openness and to protect our precious independence. Every reader
contribution, big or small, is so valuable.

### AT: Profit/Self Interest

#### Capitalism isn't solely driven by self-interest; business is motivated by purpose, not the maximization of profits 

**Palmer 11 (Palmer, Tom; libertarian author and theorist, Senior Fellow
at the Cato Institute, Vice President for International Programs at the
Atlas Network; October 14, 2011; "The Morality of Capitalism: What Your
Professors Won't Tell You";
https://www.atlasnetwork.org/assets/uploads/misc/The-Morality-of-Capitalism-PDF.pdf)**

Palmer: In what way do you think that other motivations beyond
self-interest are important for capitalism? Mackey: I just don't like
the question, because people have different defi nitions of
self-interest and you end up talking past each other frequently when you
talk about this subject, which 16 is why I was mentioning the sophomoric
type of discussion you have in college about everything being
self-interest[. What I'm suggesting is that human beings are complex and
we have many motivations, of which self-interest is one, but hardly the
only one. We're motivated by many things that we care about, that
include, but are not limited to, our self-interest]{.underline}. I think
that in some ways the libertarian movement---possibly due to the
combined infl uence of Ayn Rand and many economists---has gotten to a
kind of ideological dead end that I don't think does justice to business
or capitalism or human nature. If you think about it, the time in our
lives when we're probably the most self-interested is when we're young
and emotionally immature. Most children and adolescents are highly
self-involved or narcissistic. They're acting from their self-interest,
as they perceive it. As we mature and we grow, we become more capable of
empathy and compassion and love and a fuller range of human emotions.
People do things for lots of reasons. [A false dichotomy is often set up
between self-interest, or selfishness, and altruism]{.underline}. To me
it is a false dichotomy, because we're obviously both. We are
self-interested, but we're not just self-interested. We also care about
other people. We usually care a great deal about the wellbeing of our
families. We usually care about our communities and the larger society
that we live in. We can also care about the well-being of animals and
our larger environment. We have ideals that motivate us to try to make
the world a better place. By a strict defi nition, they would seem to
contradict self-interest, unless you get back into the circular argument
that everything you care about and want to do is self-interest. So I
don't think self-interest is enough. I don't think calling every act
self-interested is a good theory of human nature. I think that
capitalism and business should fully refl ect the complexity of human
nature. [I also think it does great damage to the "brands" of business
and capitalism, because it allows the enemies of capitalism and business
to portray them as selfish and greedy and exploitative]{.underline}.
That really bothers me, Tom, because capitalism and business are the
greatest forces for good in the world. It's been that way for at least
the last three hundred years . . . and they don't get suffi cient credit
for the amazing value that they have created. 17 Palmer: What, besides
pursuing self-interest, or profi t, does a business do? Mackey: Putting
it generally, successful businesses create value. [The beautiful thing
about capitalism is that it's ultimately based on voluntary exchange for
mutual benefit]{.underline}. Take a business like Whole Foods Market,
for example: we create value for our customers through the goods and
services we provide for them. They don't have to trade with us; they do
it because they want to, because they think it's in their interest to do
so. So we're creating value for them. We create value for the people
that work for us: our team members. None of them are slaves. They are
all voluntarily working because they feel like it's a job they want to
do; the pay is satisfactory; they derive many benefi ts from working at
Whole Foods, psychic as well as monetary. So we're creating value for
them. We're creating value for our investors, because, well, our market
cap's over \$10 billion dollars and we started at nothing! So we've
created over \$10 billion dollars' worth of value for our investors over
the past thirty-plus years. None of our stockholders are forced to own
our stock. They all do so voluntarily because they believe we're
creating value for them. We're creating value for our suppliers, who
trade with our business. I've watched them over the years, watched their
businesses grow, watched them fl ourish---and that's all proceeded
voluntarily. They help make Whole Foods better and we help make them
better. Palmer: You label your philosophy "conscious capitalism." What
do you mean by that? Mackey: We use that term to distinguish it from all
those other labels that generate a lot of confusion when they're all
lumped together, like "corporate social responsibility," or Bill Gates's
"creative capitalism," or "sustainable capitalism." We have a very clear
defi nition of conscious capitalism, based on four principles. The fi
rst principle is that business has the potential to have a higher
purpose that may include making money, but is not restricted to it. So
every business has the potential for a higher purpose. [And if you think
about it, all the other professions in 18 our society are motivated by
purpose, beyond a narrow interpretation of purpose as restricted to
maximizing profits. Doctors are some of the highest paid people in our
society and yet doctors have a purpose---to heal people---and that's the
professional ethics taught in medical school. That's not to say that
there are no greedy doctors out there, but at least many of the doctors
I've known do genuinely care about their patients and try to heal them
when they're sic]{.underline}k. Teachers try to educate people and
architects design buildings and lawyers---once you've taken all the
lawyer jokes out of the equation---are attempting to promote justice and
fairness in our society. [Every profession has a purpose beyond
maximizing profits and so does business]{.underline}. Whole Foods is a
grocer, so we're selling high-quality natural and organic foods for
people and helping them to live healthier and longer lives. Palmer: And
the second principle? Mackey: The second principle of conscious
capitalism is the stakeholder principle, which I alluded to earlier,
which is that you should think about the diff erent stakeholders for
which a business creates value and who can impact a business. You should
think about the complexity of your business in the attempt to create
value for all of these interdependent stakeholders---customers,
employees, suppliers, investors, and communities. The third principle is
that a business needs leaders who are highly ethical and who put the
purpose of the business fi rst. They attempt to serve that purpose and
they attempt to follow the stakeholder principle. So they have to walk
the talk of the business.

#### The structure of capitalism allows for massive profit in which both bosses and workers benefit- this profit leads to innovation

**Wright 18** (Nicola-Wright; writer and editor for LibertyWorks,
3/1/18, "What Has Capitalism Ever Done For Us?",
<https://quillette.com/2018/03/01/capitalism-ever-done-us/>)

**[Critics of capitalism view employment as exploitation. The worker is
the one who generates the value, and yet they are paid a fraction of the
profits made by the employer. In this model, the worker is 'forced' to
sell their labour power for a wage. But this ignores the risk, time,
energy directed by the capitalist into his enterprise. It ignores the
voluntary nature of employment, and the benefits of being able to
exchange a skill set for units of stored value. It also ignores the
benefits of being able to exchange wages for increasingly inexpensive
and more abundant goods. But let us for a moment accept the exploitation
of labour model as correct; if employment is exploitative, then what is
the proposed alternative? The]{.underline}** Labor Theory of Value which
is central to the economic philosophy of Karl Marx is used to
demonstrate that workers are exploited by capitalism. According to this
theory, the value of a commodity can be estimated by the number of hours
of labour that were required to produce it. However, this fails to fully
understand the subjective reasons we desire any given object. This can
be illustrated by the words of economist and theologian the Reverend
Richard Whately who noted that pearls do not "fetch a high price because
men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because
they fetch a high price." If you've decided that products are only
valued because of the number of hours that have gone into producing
them, then the next logical conclusion is that any profits made by the
entrepreneur are immoral. The means of production must therefore be
better off in the hands of the workers themselves. But if profits are
out, then the motivation to produce is gone, the price signal is gone,
and production decisions must then be collectively planned. Because
consensus by a large and disparate body of people requires
representation, it is inevitable that only a small number of people end
up at the top of the chain, making decisions that the collective whole
must abide by. In other words, in order for such a system to work,
coercion is required. It is authoritarian. **[Even Friedrich Engels,
co-author with Marx of *The Communist Manifesto*, foresaw that planning
under a system based on 'labor hours' as opposed to subjective value and
the competitive price system would be unworkable: To desire in a society
of producers who exchange their commodities, to establish the
determination of value by labour time, by forbidding competition to
establish this determination of value through pressure on prices in the
only way in which it can be established, is therefore merely to prove
that...]{.underline}**one has adopted the usual Utopian disdain of
economic laws...Only through the undervaluation and overvaluation of
products is it forcibly brought home to the individual commodity
producers what things and what quantity of them society requires or does
not require...**[*If now competition is to be forbidden to make the
individual producers aware, by the rise or fall of prices, how the world
market stands, then their eyes are completely blinded*.]{.underline}**
During a state visit to the US in 1989, former Russian president Boris
Yeltsin made an unscheduled stop at a Randall's grocery. When he saw the
abundance of produce on offer he was astounded. In [his
autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Grain-Autobiography-Boris-Yeltsin/dp/0671700553),
Yeltsin wrote: When I saw those shelves crammed with hundreds, thousands
of cans, cartons and goods of every possible sort, for the first time I
felt quite frankly sick with despair for the Soviet people. That such a
potentially super-rich country as ours has been brought to a state of
such poverty! It is terrible to think of it. Two years later, Yeltsin
left the Communist Party and began a reform process that would see him
become the first democratically elected Russian leader and preside over
the demise of the Soviet Union. The centrally planned communist Soviet
economy based on the Marxist Labour Theory of Value, simply could not
compete with the abundance that we take for granted in modern capitalist
societies. Without the knowledge that the price signal sends, top down
central planning results in inefficiencies and waste, while at the same
time denying individuals freedom and choice. **[Who would you trust
more? Human beings driven by self interest who are in the business of
providing goods and services that please consumers, or human beings
driven by self-interest in positions that grant them enormous
bureaucratic power over others? A collectivist system requires that
people change their innate motivations. Instead of striving to improve
their individual lot, they must look at the big picture and elevate the
collective good above their own self interest. History has demonstrated
that this is an unrealistic expectation, no matter how preferable it may
seem on paper. A capitalist system, however, does not require that
individuals change their very nature, in fact it relies on the
motivation of self-interest. That is not to say that in a capitalist
system there are no philanthropists or big-picture thinkers and
creatives. But a capitalist system does not *require* that everybody
thinks and acts in this way in order for it to succeed.]{.underline}**

### Arm Sales Link Turn - Generic

#### Arms sales are a form of profit-based capitalist corruption -- the aff is negative state action against this corruption

**Prashad 19** (Vijay Prashad; 4-26-2019; \"If war is an industry, how
can there be peace in a capitalist World?\";
https://mronline.org/2019/04/26/if-war-is-an-industry-how-can-there-be-peace-in-a-capitalist-world/;
7-28-2019)

Why do governments spend such a vulgar amount on weapons? In his
monumental Grundrisse (1857), **[Karl Marx made the offhand, but
accurate remark, 'The impact of war is self-evident, since economically
it is exactly the same as if the nation were to drop a part of its
capital into the ocean']{.underline}**. A permanent war economy is a
waste, even if there are massive profits to be made by these warfare
companies. So much can be done with \$2 trillion--a mere \$30 billion
per year to end world hunger, as the UN Food and Agricultural
Organisation noted in 2008. Last year, the UN began a campaign to raise
\$10 billion to eradicate illiteracy. But even these meagre funds have
been impossible to raise, the promise of 'billions into trillions' from
the much-heralded public-private partnerships falling flat. **[There is
always money for war, but never enough money to build the scaffolding
for peace. There is always the illusion that military spending is for
security, when it appears to be more for profit.]{.underline}** The
entire industry is lubricated with bribes. Joe Roeber of Transparency
International said that the **[arms trade is 'hard-wired for
corruption'.]{.underline}** 'In 1997, I was told in Washington that a
mid-nineties report by the CIA concluded', he wrote, that **['arms trade
corruption then accounted for 40-45% of the total corruption in world
trade'. The national security argument, Roeber suggested, 'throws a veil
of secrecy around arms deals', whose scale is so large that even small
percentages of bribes make for large dollar amounts. Bribery is normal,
the deals that are revealed are startling--bribes running from \$300
million (the South African-BAE deal from 1997-98) to \$8 billion (the
Saudi-BAE deal from 1985-2007).]{.underline}**

#### Arm sales are directly tied to capitalism -- reducing them rejects this money-gaining prioritization

**Pavey 09** \[Sean Pavey writes for the Newspaper of the party for
socialism and liberation, Sep 16, 2009, \"U.S. arms sales soar during
capitalist economic downturn,\" Liberation News,
https://www.liberationnews.org/09-09-16-us-arms-sales-soar-during-capi-html/\]

**[According to a recently released Congressional Research Service
report, the United States has firmly established itself as the home of
the most successful military arms dealers in the world. While the
worldwide capitalist economic crisis has led to a significant drop in
profits in arms deals in other parts of the world, U.S. arms deals have
risen by nearly \$12.5 billion from 2007, increasing from \$25.4 billion
to \$37.8 billion]{.underline}**. According to the report, "Conventional
Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 2001-2008," U.S. transfers
represent over two-thirds of global armament sales, making the United
States the world's largest arms dealer. U.S. arms sales far outpace
Italy, the country second on the list, which had \$13 billion in sales.
The congressional report explains that this rise in U.S. arms sales can
be attributed to "the continuation of significant equipment and support
services contracts with a broad-based number of U.S. clients globally."
**[Almost \$30 billion of U.S. arms sales went to client states like
Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. Client
states not only serve as markets for arm sales, they help to protect the
interests of U.S. imperialism across the world. The U.S. government
spends more on war and weapons than the rest of the world combined. The
official defense budget for the 2009 fiscal year is somewhere between
\$533 and \$544 billion, accounting for 54 percent of U.S. federal
spending]{.underline}**. But this does not account for all of the United
States' military spending. In addition to the money allocated to the
Department of Defense, \$205.5 billion has been dedicated specially to
the wars and occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan. When those funds are
added to the rest of the military budget, it adds up to \$739.2 billion.
This amount dwarfs the money the United States spends on health and
education, which combines to make up roughly 11.5 percent of all federal
spending. **[The U.S. ruling class is not only in the business of making
war on the world, it is also in the business of making great profits
from war and repression in addition to the billions of dollars made from
arms sales. War profiteering is a criminal enterprise.]{.underline}**

### Transition Wars

#### Transitions away from capitalism cause great power nuclear conflict

**Hanappi 19** (Hardy Gerhard Hanappi; European political economist,
Jean Monnet Chair for Political Economy of European Integration and
professor at the Institute of Statistics and Mathematical Methods in
Economics of the TU Wien; January 2019; "From Integrated Capitalism to
Disintegrating Capitalism. Scenarios of a Third World War";
<https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/91397/1/MPRA_paper_91397.pdf>; accessed
7/28/19)

A further push of expenditure in 2018 has been already initiated by
Donald Trump. Contrary to John von Neumann's judgement on the situation
in 1938 it nevertheless is still not too late to stop war preparations.
The chances for a peace-keeping intervention are still there, but to get
a clearer picture of their forms and prospects it is necessary to
imagine first the ways in which the worst, **[a World War 3, can
happen]{.underline}**. This is exactly what John von Neumann avoided: A
scenario approach based on dialectics. What follows are **[three
scenarios of different forms of WW3]{.underline}**. They should be read
as purified thought experiments and not as parallel forecasts. As the
analysis of WW2 in retrospect showed, a modern World War always will be
a clash of several different global contradictions that at a certain
point in time are getting synchronized, accumulated and expressed as
violent explosion of military fight. The three types of WW3 exposed
therefore are meant to depict different sets of class motives for a
better understanding, **[while in a real WW3 they, of course, will be
mixed in unforeseeable proportions.]{.underline}**

**[Scenario 1: A classical truel: USA-Russia-China]{.underline}** Since
the most significant appearances of Disintegrating Capitalism as
authoritarian governance form currently are the USA, Russia and China it
is tempting to model a possible Third World War as a truel. **[A truel
is an extension of a pistol-duel to three shooters.]{.underline}** This
type of situation has been modelled by game theorists and lead to some
surprising results16. To derive the probabilities of survival of the
three enemies USA, **[Russia, and China several rigid rules of the
analysed truel have been introduced]{.underline}**  Shooting order is
determined by drawing lots randomly.  They continue firing at each
other in this order until only a single entity is alive.  All shots are
lethal, and everyone knows that entity USA hits in 100% of all shots,
Russia hits in 80% of all shots and China hits in 50% of all shots. 
Each entity chooses its ideal strategy.  Each entity has the option of
intentionally missing. With the use of transition matrices this special
case can easily be solved17 and it is found that the probability to
survive the truel is highest for China -- the worst shooter (!) -- with
52%. The second best survival rate is 30% for the USA, the best shooter;
interpret this as its overwhelming military power. The worst chances to
survive are the 18% survival rate of Russia, a medium level shooter.
Remarkably, it turns out that it is advantageous for the worst shooter
to shoot in the air, i.e. to avoid the battle, as long as the two better
shooters fire at each other. This little formal narrative18, despite its
short-cummings due to rigid assumptions, is quite telling. In principle,
in 3-person games it can quite well be the case that the chances to
survive are not best for the strongest player. Moreover, the necessity
to enter such a game of simultaneously shooting at each other (WW3) at
all is quantified: If the utility to carry on without WW3 is multiplied
by one minus the expected survival probability, then this expected
utility can be compared to the expected utility derived by multiplying
the survival probability with the utility of being the sole survivor. As
long as the former is larger than the latter for each of the three no
WW3 will be started. Resistance against war in the general public can
modify not only expectations on the utility of being a sole winner,
public opinion also influences military power because government
expenditure devoted to warfare reduces resources available for domestic
use. All this clearly is part of the tool box of global peace movements.
To include Europe as a fourth player is inadequate since the turn to
large authoritarian political entities implies also a turn to military
regimes. Thus NATO is the relevant entity in charge of the European
peninsula. And since the end of WW2 it still is an US general who is the
high commander of NATO in Europe. Seen from this perspective the efforts
of some EU officials to build-up an independent European army are
futile. As Donald Trump frankly observed Europe\'s contribution should
consist only of financial support for military expenses (2% of GDP),
while military and political command - Trump is an enemy of the
political aspirations of the EU - should stay under US command. The
largest gain of territory of NATO was the eastern extension of the EU in
2004. The immediate inclusion of the new EU members in NATO went almost
unnoticed in the public, showing the ignorance, the missing attention of
political economists concerning the upcoming military dimension. More
recently, **[the military strategy of Trump seems to include the
possibility to delegate part of local operational responsibility to
close vasals]{.underline}**, which receive massive weapon support from
the US, e.g. Saudi Arabia and Israel in the Middle East. Turkey, one of
the strongest NATO branches in the area is a special case. It seems to
have been allowed to destroy an emergent state of the Kurdish
population, which would have been closer to the European style of
governance. The fact that the EU is practically impotant to interfere is
just another proof of its irrelevance in the global 3-player-game.

**[Scenario 2:]{.underline}** **[Dissolution: Multiple civil wars in
many main countries]{.underline}** **[Another view of global war sees it
as parallel smaller civil wars in many countries. The global focus is
split into fights within nations or region]{.underline}**s. The
theoretical point of departure of this perspective is the assumption
that the dominant horizon that shapes the internal model-building
process of class members is restricted to their local, 'cultural'
environment. **[National classes, alienated and confused with respect to
the existing globalised production system, only can react to their
relative welfare status; either relative to other national classes or
relative to the immediate p]{.underline}**ast. Though mainly based on
emotions, on feelings instead of theory, the correlated political
actions are directly related to observable welfare effects, e.g.
household consumption due to either increased profits or increased real
wages. Blindness with respect to everything that happens outside the own
nation state is a necessary ingredient of national class rhetoric19, in
a sense it is the price to be paid for that veil of concreteness. The
commonly used name of this successful local party strategy is
\'populism\'. It is the foundation of national class struggle that
eventually takes on the form of civil war. In Europe populism comes in
two varieties: right-wing populism and left-wing populism. Both variants
-- sometimes implicitly, sometimes explicitly - refer to a past
historical national state form that they propose to return to.
Right-wing populism basically aims to re-install the authoritarian,
racist regimes that seized power in Germany and Italy during the 30-ties
of the last century. In ideological warfare it is characterized by
xenophobia and -- with the exception of right-wing populism in Israel --
anti-Semitism. With respect to the organizational setup of the ruling
class it proposes a hierarchically stream-lined police state; and tries
to transform existing institutional frameworks in that direction as soon
as it comes into state power. Left-wing populism wants to return to the
national model of Integrated Capitalism that prevailed in the first
three decades after the end of WW2. It thus insists on the
institutionalized solutions to class struggle -- compromises between
national classes - that have been emerging in this period; and aims at
extending them to reach outcomes that are more favorable for the
exploited classes and several minority groups in society20 . While
right-wing populism tends to form coalitions with the traditional
national ruling class, left-wing populism tends to form coalitions with
the remainders of socialdemocratic parties in power at the height of
Integrated Capitalism. With Integrated Capitalism vanishing as the
globalization of the human production system is accomplishing both
populist visions are striving for power. Right-wing populism always is
the first mover since it directly opposes Integrated Capitalism. And it
indeed can point to the fact that Integrated Capitalism failed to
overcome class antagonisms, failed to fulfil the promise of a
substantially better life for the majority of people. This became more
than visible - it was directly felt - as soon as the great crisis of
2008 occurred. Right-wing populism therefore can use traditional
national electoral systems to get into state power, from where it then
can start to transform states21. Leftwing populism, the second mover,
reacts on the destruction of the traditional institutional framework, in
Europe mainly appearing as the 'social net' of the so-called 'welfare
state'. But evidently **[this type of populism has an organizational
deficit]{.underline}**: The representatives of Integrated Capitalism are
discredited and cannot act as leaders, the movement therefore is forced
to experiment with new forms of national organization. More
participatory forms of democratic organization take more time, and with
multiple social groups involved this weakens this movements strength
vis-à-vis right-wing populism. Furthermore, its vision of an improved
national Integrated Capitalism is handicapped by the fact that many
people still remember its failures, while the song of national glory
that right-wing populism sings refers to an imagined far-away past that
no one ever had seen. Despite these disadvantages left-wing populism can
sometimes be successful in so far as it prevents the right-wing to gain
state power22 . **[National class conflict can lead to national civil
war between the para-military branches of populist
movements,]{.underline}** or -- more likely -- between one group already
in state power and the para-military forces of its opponent. It cannot
be expected that this happens simultaneously all over the world -- the
necessary conditions in different countries are too different -- but
contagious effects might occur. The lesson to be learned from this
second scenario of WW3 is that the distinction between local national
perceptions of households and the globally interwoven human production
system is of utmost importance. National civil war is an aspect of WW3
that calls for a deep theory of internal model-building processes of
families on cultural islands, which at the same time are economically
tightly linked to each other. The fluid mobility of national ideological
political entrepreneurs, the creators of populist movements, meets the
rigidity of dire global economic constraints.**[This is the crash that
provokes local wars.]{.underline}** No single national class can escape
from this logic, and apart from the fraction of international finance
(an offspring of all nationally ruling classes) there are only a few
signs of other global classes. Perhaps on the bottom of Pandora's Box a
'Global Class of Organic Intellectuals' might emerge, compare \[Hanappi,
2018c, 2019\]. A simple formalized model to enhance the understanding of
this second world war scenario, comparable to the truel, does not exist
yet. The most advanced research frontier in this respect can be found in
the latest advances of complexity theory. An excellent example of the
creativity in this field is the work of Yaneer Bar-Yam. In a recent
co-authored paper \[T. Bar-Yam,O. Lynch, and Y. Bar-Yam, 2018\] with the
help of information theory an 'inverted second law of thermodynamics'
has been developed and the application to questions of large scale
organization of the multi-layered human society is hinted at. In other
words, the 2nd law of thermodynamics used to describe the trend towards
increasing disorder characterizing non-living systems is complemented by
a dialectical counterpart that allows to describe the build-up of order
in living (social) systems - in a formal way. This theory is too general
to allow for a specific application to the problems of the contemporary
global human society, but it shows that in a world where instability is
letting its components fall apart (Disintegrating Capitalism) a new
global order (a new mode of coordination) can only be reached if a
certain minimum of order at the lowest level of its organization is
present. Moreover, this implies that in times of revolutionary shake-up
there is just a finite, even a small set of smallest building blocks for
the next stable era. The prospect is to study the respective
implications of the different elements of this set by computer
simulations.

**[Scenario 3: Upheaval: Poor versus rich world The third scenario for
WW3 looks at the profoundly divergent trajectories of welfare of poor
parts and rich parts of the world economy, and concludes that this
development will lead to a severe military explosion]{.underline}**.
Diagram 2 presents a rough overview of global GDP developments. It uses
data on all countries in the world. Real GDP in constant 2011 US Dollars
is divided by respective population numbers of countries to arrive
average GDP per capita for each country. This number then is considered
to be an approximation, an index, for being a rich or a poor country.
The list of countries then is ordered according to this index. Then
countries are grouped according to five ranges of this index. With the
help of the population figure of each country the number of people
living in each of these ranges can be computed and is used for the bar
chart in diagram 2. It is clear that this procedure only provides a
rough picture of what is going on in global economic dynamics since
1991. But GDP still seems to be the most reliable economic data
measuring economic activity, and therefore average living conditions in
a country. Moreover, it is one of the small set of numbers that is
available for all countries in the world for a longer time period.
Population numbers certainly play a central role and combining them with
GDP allows a twofold proxy: How much has been produced in a country23
and how much can be consumed? The US Dollar, of course, is the generally
accepted measure of social exchange value, a measure provided by the
current global hegemon. Inflation has been subtracted and exchange rates
have not been adjusted by purchasing power parities. Since 1991
worldwide economic activity has increased remarkably. There also have
been noticeable shifts towards the second lowest (yellow) segment of the
distribution stemming mainly from the lowest (red) segment. This
dominating jump can be contributed to a large extent to the rise of
China, which entered the second lowest group between 2006 and 2014.
Another fact is the slow but steady increase of the number of people
living in the richest (black) layer. To the contrary, the amount of
people living in the two layers between the richest and the two poorest
segments is more or less constant, despite the overall growth of the
bars. This implies the border between the richest and the two poorest
ones is getting sharper. India is in the lowest layer (5224 US \$, 1295
million persons), China now in the second lowest (12473 US \$, 1369
million persons), and Russia has entered the lower one of the two middle
layers (24039 US\$, 143 million persons); all data from 2014. Another
contribution to the sharpening of the contrast between rich and poor
comes from the rising inequality of income and wealth within almost
every country during the last three decades. Whatever economic measure
is used, e.g. Gini or Theil index, national income and wealth inequality
has been exploding almost everywhere. In the smaller countries in the
two poorer layers of the world economy the rage against inequality often
has led to local changes in government, sometimes even local
revolutions. A big bang of the poor against the rich world did not take
place yet, military support by rich countries, in particular the USA,
enabled local exploitative regimes so far to keep rebellions at the
gates, a neo-colonialist feature. The new model of Disintegrating
Capitalism has as two of its main carriers Russia and China, their old
role as supporters of a revolution in the Third World is definitely
gone. The remaining giant state of India, indeed a terribly poor and
overpopulated country, is caught in religious paralysis that now even is
in state power. Nevertheless, **[an upheaval of large masses of people
in the poor countries]{.underline}** might occur. Remember that 3
billion persons (lowest layer) live in 1000 US \$ circumstances and are
able to observe on smartphones that 1 billion of richer persons (richest
layer) in another part of the world experiences living circumstances at
least seven times as good as they are in. Neither the eruption of the
Arab Spring in 2011 nor the movement of the yellow vests in France in
2018 can be traced back to a single originator with a well-developed
plan. Modern information and communication technology enhances action
not only after a revolt has started, it actually launches a new form of
spontaneity. It is evident that military facts contradict a scenario 3
of WW3. But one should take into account that the enemy of the rich
countries' military forces is widespread over the whole globe. **[Armed
forces of the nuclear powers (USA, Russia, France, UK, China) are used
to target military centres not unlimited territories, and as they can
expect resistance against warfare also from inside their countries
traditional measures of the strength of military force might be
misleading]{.underline}**. Not only the US experience in the Vietnam War
has been a wake-up call in this respect, **[also the continuously
striking religious terrorism has not been beaten yet24 by the 'war on
terrorism' that George Bush proclaimed many years ago]{.underline}**. It
might also be noted that on the side of the rebels it often is not so
much a rational military general that guides action but rather a shared
believe, even a common religion preached by independent hierarchies of
religious leaders in different countries, which inspires warriors.

anticipate the complexities of state-building, they were even more
overwhelmed by the force of nationalism. **[Communist states espoused a
spirit of Marxist universalism in which solidarities would be based on
class]{.underline}** rather than on ethnic or racial particularity, but
the reality they faced was far different. **[In one of history's crueler
ironies this universalist ideology appeared at precisely the same moment
when nationalism]{.underline}**, perhaps the most powerful and enduring
particularist ideology in history, **[reached its apogee]{.underline}**.
Even more so than the working classes, it was nations who cried out for
freedom and self-determination. In the competition between class and
nation, the latter consistently trumped the former. 49 This was true not
only at the mass level but at the elite level as well. **[Leninist
parties had little choice but to come to terms with the popular victory
of nation over class]{.underline}**. Out of power, they played the
nationality card, garnering the support of some of the losers of ethnic
politics. 50 Once in power, **[their response was twofold: one part
accommodationist and the other, brutally violent. Leninist theory
summarized the accomodationist aspect under the rubric "national in form
and socialist in content,]{.underline}**" which was really a way of
recasting imperial Russia into manageable units **[in which Moscow
promoted or even created cultures anew but brutally crushed any and all
attempts at genuine political independence]{.underline}**. The Soviet
imperial design made sense since the revolutionary objective was global
in a world where national belonging would only slowly, if ever,
diminish. Basic unity, however, required standardization. Russians and
Russian culture occupied this position in what became quasi-colonial
operations stretching from Siberia, through Central Asia and the
Caucasus, the East Slavic peripheries, and ultimately into the Baltic
states where Russian settlers fundamentally altered the ethnic
demography in the years running up to and immediately following World
War II. Some of this project could be undertaken with mild
administrative measures, but much of it faced stiff resistance and
required a great deal of force to implement. Amir Weiner invokes Zygmunt
Bauman's conception of the ethnic gardening state in order to describe
the Soviet nationality regime.51 Rather than eliminate all nations,
Stalin chose to make the entire project governable through labeling,
cultivating, identifying, and, when needed, weeding out specific
dangers. Nowhere was this approach more evident than in the "marches" of
East-Central Europe, which only fell under Soviet control in 1944- 45.
**[There, the politics of ethnicity, irredentism, and territorial
grievance dominated interwar politics. The Soviet response as they moved
into the region was to "resolve" the problem of ethnicity and borders
once and for all in a way that rivaled the demographic engineering of
the Nazis, if not in body count, then certainly in
ambitio]{.underline}**n. German minorities were expelled from every
country in the region. The entire country of Poland was moved a couple
of hundred kilometers westward and both **[Ukrainians and
Poles]{.underline}** (and others) **[were forcibly moved to the
"correct" side of the new borders of their titular
"countries"]{.underline}** (the process had begun in 1943 during the
mutual bloodletting between the two groups). As for the region's Jews,
Germany's extermination effort had eliminated Jewish commercial and
cultural weight from urban areas and communists expressed little
interest in restoring the Jewish presence. Lvov, once heavily Polish and
Jewish, now became a Ukrainian city, German Breslau became Polish
Wroclaw, and Polish and Jewish Wilno was now Vilnius, the capital of
Lithuania. Communists may have meant to treat the national question in a
new way but in East-Central Europe seen through the lens of the longue
durée, the brutality of the Leninist gardening state produced rather
familiar "nationalizing" results. They are illustrated in table one
below: Table one: Size of Titular Majorities before and after Communism
in Selected Countries52 Several features of this table are noteworthy.
First and perhaps most momentous, in East-Central Europe the Leninist
parties completed the process of demographic engineering begun by the
Germans during the war, but altered the composition of the results.
**[Through the adjustment of borders, forced population transfers, and
renewed "nationalization" efforts, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania
were transformed from multinational states into
nation-states.]{.underline}** The ethnic politics and intractable
irredentism that made these societies in the interwar period almost
ungovernable had been changed for good (so much so that in the
post-communist period Jewish life could be reintroduced in Poland with a
touch of astonishing nostalgia). The politics of coercive nationalizing
modernism had been completed not by the nationalists but by Leninist
parties. In this way, they unknowingly made the transition to democracy
easier in the region than it otherwise might have been.

### AT: Revolutionary Struggle

#### Even if all their rhetoric about revolutionary commitment is persuasive its not an accurate description of how people act -- the status quo proves that the world is far from the conditions for revolt, violent or otherwise.

**Eror 17** \[Aleks Eror's work has been published by The Guardian,
Vice, Slate, and The Daily Telegraph, amongst others, 2-6-2017, \"The
West Isn't Ready for a Revolution,\" New Republic,
https://newrepublic.com/article/140429/west-isnt-ready-revolution\]

**[As bad as things are, they're evidently not bad enough for a broad
enough base of people---yet---because mass discontent hasn't translated
into mass action. The Occupy protesters may have shouted and rallied,
but they ultimately failed to attract enough popular support to evolve
from protest to movement]{.underline}**. It could be argued that their
vision wasn't compelling or clear enough, which is probably true, but
this only tells part of the story. **[Most people, it seems, simply
aren't prepared to commit themselves completely to political activism.
Instead, they want the system changed for them]{.underline}**. Although
Trump and the Brexiters like to eulogize their achievements in
revolutionary terms, their slim victories still came via the voting
booth rather than through popular uprisings. The electorate may have
rubber-stamped those victories, but they played no part in formulating
them. After all, then--Prime Minister David Cameron wasn't pressured by
the British public into holding a referendum on E.U. membership; it was
mutinous Conservative backbenchers who forced his hand. Trump is not a
product of the Tea Party. His supporters might loathe the Washington
establishment, but they never threatened to organize and shake the
pillars of power themselves. Unlike the Syrians who risked life and limb
to rise up against Bashar al-Assad, most westerners are quite clearly
still content to wait it out for a messiah---or a snake-oil salesman,
whichever one comes first---to fix the world on their behalf, rather
than muster up a solution on their own. **[We do this because most of us
fail to comprehend the sheer scale of sacrifice that wholesale political
change demands. We fixate on street protest, as if it's the political
atom bomb, rather than a singular tool with questionable efficacy. We
delude ourselves that protests' power lies in scale rather than
frequency, but the Iraq war protests wouldn't have been any less
impotent had they been bigger; they failed because they weren't
sustaine]{.underline}**d. And even if we did comprehend this, would it
change anything? Are people prepared to make the necessary sacrifices?
Otpor!'s victory over Milosevic came after nine years of struggle. In
the meantime, lives and careers were suspended. Last weekend's U.S.
airport protests petered out as Monday approached because most people
had jobs and routines to return to, so some donated pizza instead. In
Britain, protests against Trump's proposed state visit were scheduled
outside of office hours. It's quite telling that the general strike is
an utterly alien tactic to western protesters. **[Political
dissatisfaction may be widespread, but that seemingly isn't enough: The
status quo needs to be so intolerable that people are prepared to
prioritize change, and the collective effort that it demands, over their
own self-interests. Most people, regardless of their political leanings,
want reform rather than revolution. We are nowhere near that tipping
point---especially not in the U.S., where the unemployment rate is just
4.8 percent]{.underline}**. Prevailing rhetoric reveals that most
people, regardless of their political leanings, want reform rather than
revolution. The closure of corporate tax loopholes or greater
protectionism are discussed within the context of the existing system,
rather than a new one. Most Trump voters simply dream of a return to an
era of more job security and greater purchasing power, not a
fundamentally different society built on a radically new set of values.
Californian secessionists aim to insulate themselves from the Trumpian
agenda rather than forge an alternative. This is what separates them
from Occupy or Otpor! or the Baader-Meinhof Gang, and although it can be
disheartening, it also presents an opportunity. A complete and total
demolition job is nothing more than a self-serving escapist fantasy; the
majority are too invested in the system to dispense with it completely,
but recent events prove that there's an appetite for change that
outsiders can exploit from within. Let's not forget that Brexit wasn't
pioneered by a grassroots movement of disaffected Britons, but a
25-year-long ideological crusade by tory Europhobes like Daniel Hannan
and Nigel Farage, who devoted their entire lives and careers to a cause
many dismissed as futile. In Spain and Italy, respectively, Podemos and
the Five Star Movement have risen from the electorate, through the
political apparatus, and are making tangible gains in government. The
Tea Party proved to be an effective pressure group of citizen lobbyists,
and their tactics have been co-opted by the authors of the Indivisible
Guide for use in the Trump era. This is what uniquely western
revolutions look like. **[Maybe they don't fit the the simplistic,
news-optimized narrative that we're used to, but the common thread that
ties them to the headline-grabbing popular uprisings of recent years is
an absolute, total, and undivided commitment to change. Aspiring
revolutionaries just have to ask themselves if they want change
desperately enough to commit to that.]{.underline}**

### AT: Violent Revs -- Back Lash

#### Violent revolutions fail and cause regime backlash -- empirics prove

**Nicholasen 19** (Michelle Nicholasen; Media Specialist, Weatherhead

Boston University; interviewing Erica Chenoweth, Ph.D. is the Berthold

accessed 7/29/19)

Recent research suggests that **[nonviolent civil resistance is far more
successful]{.underline}** in creating broad-based change **[than violent
campaigns]{.underline}** are, a somewhat surprising finding with a story
behind it. When Erica Chenoweth started her predoctoral fellowship at
the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in 2006, she
believed in the strategic logic of armed resistance. She had studied
terrorism, civil war, and major revolutions --- Russian, French,
Algerian, and American --- and suspected that only violent force had
achieved major social and political change. But then a workshop led her
to consider proving that violent resistance was more successful than the
nonviolent kind. Since the question had never been addressed
systematically, she and colleague Maria J. Stephan began a research
project. For the next two years, Chenoweth and Stephan collected data on
all violent and nonviolent campaigns from 1900 to 2006 that resulted in
the overthrow of a government or in territorial liberation. **[They
created a data set of 323 mass actions]{.underline}**. Chenoweth
**[analyzed nearly 160 variables related to success criteria,
participant categories, state capacity, and more.]{.underline}** The
results turned her earlier paradigm on its head --- **[in the aggregate,
nonviolent civil resistance was far more effective in producing
change]{.underline}**. The Weatherhead Center for International Affairs
(WCFIA) sat down with Chenoweth, a new faculty associate who returned to
the Harvard Kennedy School this year as professor of public policy, and
asked her to explain her findings and share her goals for future
research. Chenoweth is also the Susan S. and Kenneth L. Wallach
Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Q&A Erica
Chenoweth WCFIA: In your co-authored book, "Why Civil Resistance Works:
The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict," you explain clearly why
civil resistance campaigns attract more absolute numbers of people ---
in part it's because there's a much lower barrier to participation
compared with picking up a weapon. Based on the cases you have studied,
what are the key elements necessary for a successful nonviolent
campaign? CHENOWETH: I think it really boils down to four different
things. The first is a large and diverse participation that's sustained.
The second thing is that \[the movement\] needs to elicit loyalty shifts
among security forces in particular, but also other elites. Security
forces are important because they ultimately are the agents of
repression, and their actions largely decide how violent the
confrontation with --- and reaction to --- the nonviolent campaign is
going to be in the end. But there are other security elites, economic
and business elites, state media. There are lots of different pillars
that support the status quo, and if they can be disrupted or coerced
into noncooperation, then that's a decisive factor. The third thing is
that the campaigns need to be able to have more than just protests;
there needs to be a lot of variation in the methods they use. The fourth
thing is that when campaigns are repressed --- which is basically
inevitable for those calling for major changes --- they don't either
descend into chaos or opt for using violence themselves. If **[campaigns
allow their repression to throw the movement into total disarray or they
use it as a pretext to militarize their campaign, then they're
essentially co-signing what the regime wants --- for the resisters to
play on its own playing field. And they're probably going to get totally
crushed]{.underline}**. WCFIA: Is there any way to resist or protest
without making yourself more vulnerable? CHENOWETH: People have done
things like bang pots and pans or go on electricity strikes or something
otherwise disruptive that imposes costs on the regime even while people
aren't outside. **[Staying inside for an extended period equates to a
general strike. Even limited strikes are very effective. There were
limited and general strikes in Tunisia and Egypt during their uprisings
and they were critical.]{.underline}** WCFIA: A general strike seems
like a personally costly way to protest, especially if you just stop
working or stop buying things. Why are they effective? CHENOWETH: This
is why preparation is so essential. Where campaigns have used strikes or
economic noncooperation successfully, they've often spent months
preparing by stockpiling food, coming up with strike funds, or finding
ways to engage in community mutual aid while the strike is underway. One
good example of that comes from South Africa. The anti-apartheid
movement organized a total boycott of white businesses, which meant that
black community members were still going to work and getting a paycheck
from white businesses but were not buying their products. Several months
of that and the white business elites were in total crisis. They
demanded that the apartheid government do something to alleviate the
economic strain. With the rise of the reformist Frederik Willem de Klerk
within the ruling party, South African leader P.W. Botha resigned. De
Klerk was installed as president in 1989, leading to negotiations with
the African National Congress \[ANC\] and then to free elections, where
the ANC won overwhelmingly. The reason I bring the case up is because
organizers in the black townships had to prepare for the long term by
making sure that there were plenty of food and necessities internally to
get people by, and that there were provisions for things like Christmas
gifts and holidays. WCFIA: How important is the overall number of
participants in a nonviolent campaign? CHENOWETH: One of the things that
isn't in our book, but that I analyzed later and presented in a TEDx
Boulder talk in 2013, is that a surprisingly small proportion of the
population guarantees a successful campaign: just 3.5 percent. That
sounds like a really small number, but in absolute terms it's really an
impressive number of people. In the U.S., it would be around 11.5
million people today. Could you imagine if 11.5 million people ---
that's about three times the size of the 2017 Women's March --- were
doing something like mass noncooperation in a sustained way for nine to
18 months? Things would be totally different in this country. "Countries
in which there were nonviolent campaigns were about 10 times likelier to
transition to democracies within a five-year period compared to
countries in which there were violent campaigns --- whether the
campaigns succeeded or failed." --- Erica Chenoweth WCFIA: Is there
anything about our current time that dictates the need for a change in
tactics? CHENOWETH: Mobilizing without a long-term strategy or plan
seems to be happening a lot right now, and that's not what's worked in
the past. However, there's nothing about the age we're in that
undermines the basic principles of success. I don't think that the
factors that influence success or failure are fundamentally different.
Part of the reason I say that is because they're basically the same
things we observed when Gandhi was organizing in India as we do today.
There are just some characteristics of our age that complicate things a
bit. WCFIA: You make the surprising claim that even when they fail,
civil resistance campaigns often lead to longer-term reforms than
violent campaigns do. How does that work? CHENOWETH: The finding is that
**[civil resistance campaigns often lead to longer-term reforms and
changes that bring about democratization compared with violent
campaigns]{.underline}**. Countries in which there were nonviolent
campaigns were about 10 times likelier to transition to democracies
within a five-year period compared to countries in which there were
violent campaigns --- whether the campaigns succeeded or failed. This is
because even though they "failed" in the short term, the nonviolent
campaigns tended to empower moderates or reformers within the ruling
elites who gradually began to initiate changes and liberalize the
polity.

### AT: Class focus --race and gender

#### Single focus bad -- gender and race

**Ananth 2014 (**Sriram, writer activist and trauma-therapist,
"Conceptualizing solidarity and realizing struggle: testing against the
Palestinian call for the boycott of Israel", Interface: a journal for
and about social movements, Volume 6 (2): 143 -- 163, November**)**

The second is proletarian internationalism which assumes, ultimately, a
commonality of interests for workers worldwide and thus a common program
for emancipation resulting in solidarity that saw, for example,
non-striking workers in one nation supporting striking workers in
another nation through sending aid and preventing foreign strikebreakers
(Stekloff, 1928). However, **[the collective material interests among
those in solidarity with each other are not as immediate but more
abstract, because they are based on a narrative of capital expansion,
and as a counter to bourgeois nationalism where "the working class and
socialism, and indeed internationalism, are effectively presented as
being synonymous"]{.underline}** (Pasture and Verberckmoes, 1998: 7).
**[This is all the more evident]{.underline}** when, as often happens,
**[the immediate material interests of workers in the same site or
region trump long-term internationalist solidarity or when such
solidarity degenerates to a paternalistic "labor philanthropy" of
northern activists which runs afoul of true
internationalism]{.underline}** (Gill, 2009: 677). A crucial issue to
add **[when class-solidarity as enacted out organizationally is the fact
that]{.underline}** "although they intersect and often coincide, the
actors who do battle...and \[the\] social classes in a more general
sense are, in fact, two different entities" (Baldwin, 1990: 11-12), with
**[often little attention paid by Marxists to the "organizational and
ideological diversity of the labor movement"]{.underline}** (Pasture and
Verberckmoes, 1998: 7). **[It is important to ask in this case when
class solidarity is real, when it is manufactured by actors at the
organizational helms, and when it possesses both in varying
degrees.]{.underline}** Tommie Shelby speaks of how **[Black Marxists
found it difficult "to get orthodox Marxists to take the black
experience seriously" and get them "to accept that there can be no
interracial working-class until there is racial justice"]{.underline}**
(Shelby, 2005: 6-8). A sociological study on two union-drives with very
similar structural locations and institutional paths had vastly
different results, with workers voting overwhelmingly for the union in
one location and overwhelmingly against in the other, primarily because
"**[dynamic interplay between the conditions of work, past cultural
contexts, discourse, and collective action affected the way potential
union supporters understood the meaning of the movement, and whether or
not the union made sense as a vehicle of change"]{.underline}** (Penney,
2006: 139, 157). Meredith **[Tax writes historically about alliances
between various women (a "united front") i]{.underline}**n the socialist
movement periodically occurring in the late Interface: a journal for and
about social movements 1800s and early 1900s who **["knew there was a
dialectical relationship between the movement for women's liberation and
the labor movement, and refused to give up on either]{.underline}**,"
(Tax, 1980: 13-15) **[while Diane Balser argues that "Feminists and
working women's organizations need to work with the established labor
movement...at the same time that they need to maintain a parallel,
independent women's base that will keep the Feminist vision clear and
will provide the external pressure necessary \[emphasis mine\] to
motivate labor's organizing of unorganized women]{.underline}**"
(Balser, 1987: 214-215). While it might seem like the above examples are
recreating divisions between the politics of labor and gender, or labor
and race, which are certainly not fixed but rather time/spacespecific,
what I wish to point out here is the well-understood issue of difference
among workers that a classical Marxist notion of class-solidarity either
fails to account for or only does so with the ultimate idea of
subsumption under class struggle. Apart from socioeconomic difference
among workers that labor sociologists have dealt with in great detail,
there is another crucial difference pertaining to class-solidarity,
namely space, which has been taken up by labor geographers. Rebecca
Johns in examining class and space writes: **[Workers may have class
interests that they share with workers across international borders, and
spatial interests that divide them. In reality, there is a conflict
between these interests that makes building a truly global movement
problematic. The conflict between space and class arises because workers
in capitalism's areas of global development have come to expect a
standard of living that accompanies their place in the spatial
structures of uneven development.]{.underline}** (1998: 255) What all of
the above tells us is that **[an assumption of class-solidarity brings
up the question of socioeconomic and spatial difference within the
working-class, usually resulting in the effacement of the same, which
has deleterious implications both for workers solidarity on the shop
floor as well as the internationalism of labor movements. Whether it be
upholding xenophobic, and racist attitudes towards migrant workers or
aligning with nationalist sentiment, the failure to address real
difference drastically reduces the possibility for real
solidarity/internationalism and ultimately defeats any movement towards
bettering material conditions for workers.]{.underline}** It remains
consistent with a classbased political analysis, to not only understand
that the effacement of difference (which can be done even when
difference is acknowledged, but without genuine political engagement)
only ultimately weakens the workers movement, but that, crucially,
"respecting diversity does not mean uniformity or sameness" (hooks,
2000: 58). **[It stands to reason that, while powerful and important,
there are many failings in such homogenizing projections of
class-solidarity]{.underline}**. But where orthodox Marxism (and many
other strains of left thought) faltered, transnational feminist thought
valiantly endeavored to advance.

## Perm

### Perm - Generic

#### Perm do both - Militarism is key to capitalist hegemony -- the aff reduces military aggression through arms sales 

**Lamb** 20**00** (Guy Lamb; 2000; \" Reflections on demilitarization: A
Southern African perspective, International Peacekeeping \";
https://doi.org/10.1080/13533310008413852; 7-28-2019)

Marxists do not provide a general theory of militarism, but they have
rather theorized the links between the specific aspects of militarism,
civil society and the economy.22 For them, **[militarism is a social
phenomenon that arises from the division of society into classes and the
appearance of the exploiter-state]{.underline}**.23 Marxists ascertain
that military expenditure is necessary for the maintenance of capitalism
as a viable economic system.24 Rosa Luxemburg argued that **[militarism
develops out of its own \'internal mechanical motive power\' because it
brings about the emergence of a group of highly influential
industrialists from the steel and shipbuilding sectors of the economy,
which are critical to arms production]{.underline}**. These
industrialists have a vested interest in the expansion of the arms
industry, as they can benefit enormously from lucrative government
contracts. Consequently they lobby governments for an aggressive foreign
policy. **[In addition, the production of armaments utilizes labour,
power and means of production for which there would otherwise be no
demand. Militarism provides the capitalist class with increased
opportunities for profitable investment of capital]{.underline}**.25
Under capitalism, militarism reaches an unprecedented scale and assumes
an ominous character. According to this school of thought, militarism is
used to justify the use of military means for the protection of
ownership patterns in capitalist societies. **[The development of
military technology is similarly the result of the efforts by the ruling
class to maintain its hegemonic position]{.underline}**.26
Militarization, in comparison to militarism, does not imply the formal
supremacy of the military or the dominance of a particular ideology. It
is a multi-dimensional process, historical in nature, that comprises a
dynamic set of relationships between military and society.**[27 More
specifically it is a process through which a number of elements - such
as military coups and regimes, authoritarian government, the dominance
of patriarchy, powerful military and state apparatuses, war and armed
conflict, rising military spending and arms imports, and external
military intervention - become dynamically interlinked, both to each
other and more widely to capital accumulation and projects for national
and international hegemony]{.underline}**. Yet these elements have not
always correlated, nor have they been on the increase.

### Perm -- Saudi Arabia

#### PERM: The only reason why we sell arms to Saudi Arabia is for the monetary profit. The profits blind the U.S from the violences in the region. Stopping those incentives is the first step to rejecting the logic of capital. 

**Prashad 18** (Vijay Prashad, a writing fellow at the Independent Media
Institute, chief editor of LeftWord Books and the director of
Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research. He is also the author of
Red Star Over the Third World (LeftWord, 2017) and The Death of the
Nation and the Future of the Arab Revolution (University of California
Press, 2016), among other books. Originally produced by Globetrotter, a
project of the Independent Media Institute; 8-18-18; "Saudi Arabia Has
Been Bribing the US with Arms Sales for Years";
<https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/10/not-just-trump-saudi-arabia-bribing-us-arms-sales-years.html>;)

Yves here. The uproar over the almost certain execution of Jamal
Khashoggi is so disproportionate to the event that it's become a proxy
for something else in terms of the US-Saudi relationship. The post by
Vijay Prashad makes the argument that Khashoggi went too far in
defending his allies in the royal family who were opposed to Mohammed
bin Salman, which led to his presumed execution, and **[that the US
won't do much about it due to the importance of the arms
sales]{.underline}**. While this is probably part of the equation, the
US also has important air bases in Saudi Arabia. The US recognized that
it was at risk of having the kingdom become unstable regardless of
whatever the path of succession was after King Salman, who was well
liked internally, decided to cede power. But Salman's choice of MbS was
contrary to tradition and expectations (57 year old Prince Mohammed bin
Nayef would have been the new ruler under the usual protocol), setting
factions in the royal family even more against each other. And MbS has
consolidated power in an extremely heavy-handed way, by using corruption
charges to arrest rivals and their allies and stripping them of assets.
As Wikipedia noted:The arrests resulted in the final sidelining of the
faction of the late King Abdullah and MbS's complete consolidation of
control of all three branches of the security forces, making him the
most powerful man in Saudi Arabia since his grandfather, the first King,
Ibn Saud. There are likely members of the US military apparatus who are
sympathizers with the losers in the royal family power struggle But if
what Wikipedia says is correct, MbS looks to have consolidated his
position quickly and with a ruthless show of force. It's puzzling to see
the press up in arms about Khashoggi, given that the US has been joined
at the hip with the thuggish Saudis for decades. Informed reader input
welcomed. By now, few doubt that Jamal Khashoggi is dead. It is most
likely that the Saudi journalist---who once advised kings and
billionaires---was killed by an interrogation team sent from Saudi
Arabia to meet him in Turkey. If this was the case, then it is
impossible for the hit on Khashoggi to have taken place without a green
light from the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman (affectionately known
as MBS). The Saudi royal palace would have signed Khashoggi's death
warrant because he had turned on the kingdom he otherwise loyally
served. Nothing in Jamal Khashoggi's career suggested that he would
become a dissident. But, MBS had consolidated power against the fragile
balance within the royal family and he had arrested and humiliated
Khashoggi's friends, including Al Waleed bin Talal of Twitter and
Goldman Sachs. Khashoggi's dissent was the complaint of one fraction of
the ruling elite against another. If he were an unknown Saudi blogger
sitting in Virginia, fulminating for a miniscule readership, he would
have been left alone. That he represented powerful interests inside the
kingdom made it impossible for him to survive. Saudi Arabia is in the
midst of an internal review of the death of Khashoggi. Whispers from
inside the kingdom suggest that the final report will say that this was
a "rogue" operation, a word introduced into this incident by U.S.
President Donald Trump. Trump, who has bet a great deal on Saudi Arabia,
has been caught flatfooted. He did not want this scandal. He thought
that disavowing Khashoggi---because he was a permanent resident of the
U.S. rather than a U.S. citizen---would make the case disappear. But it
has not, largely because Khashoggi has close friends in Washington, D.C.
(including colleagues at the Washington Post), because he is so
well-connected inside Saudi Arabia, and because the Turkish
government---which is in a long-term tussle with Saudi Arabia---will not
let the matter drop. Even a substantial bribe from Saudi Arabia was
rebuffed by Turkey. This news is not going anywhere. Pressure came upon
Trump to at least block U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. But, Trump is a
pragmatic man. **[He knows that this would do two things he cannot
afford---it would show that the U.S. does not stand by its allies, who
might then seek allies elsewhere, and it would jeopardize the massive
arms deals that the U.S. arms manufacturers have signed with the Saudis.
Buying arms from the United States has come into use in Saudi Arabia's
insane war against Yemen, but more than that it has always been an
insurance policy, a way to recycle Saudi petrodollars into the U.S.
exchequer through arms deals.]{.underline}** Not many U.S.
politicians---who have arms manufacturers in each district---would be
willing to throw Saudi Arabia overboard as long as it buys weapons
systems that it mostly never used. Given this situation**[, Trump quite
rightly ignored calls to stop the arms sales---"I actually think we'd be
punishing ourselves if we did that."]{.underline}** Why say that Trump
was right to do what he did? It was not only **[because Trump wanted to
maintain the U.S.-Saudi relationship. It was largely because Trump's
industrial strategy relies upon weapons sales around the world. And this
is not merely Trump's strategy.]{.underline}** This has been the
industrial strategy of the U.S. ever since manufacturing began to escape
U.S. shores from the 1970s and ever since the USSR collapsed and Russian
weapons manufacturing deteriorated (a situation remedied only recently).
It is worth pointing out that the U.S. has been the world's largest arms
exporter for decades. It is also worth pointing out that U.S. arms
exports have increased astronomically since 2008; it was arms
manufacturing that was the fulcrum of the U.S. recovery from the credit
crisis. Twenty percent of U.S. arms sales go to Saudi Arabia, whose
appetite for U.S. weapons has increased by 448 percent from 2008-12 to
2013-17. **[This monstrous relationship that deposits Saudi petrodollars
into the U.S. in exchange for weapons benefits the U.S. financial
markets and the arms manufacturers---two key fractions of U.S.
capital.]{.underline}** In previous decades, the Saudis warehoused the
arms, watching them rot and then be replaced with new arms. They were
not buying arms as much as using the oil profits to underwrite the U.S.
financial and arms industries. This was a Saudi bribe, an insurance
policy, to the U.S. political class. It ensured that Saudi Arabia was a
key ally of the U.S., and it bought the friendship of the U.S.
politicians who made sure to shut down any conversation about human
rights abuses inside Saudi Arabia---and the very fact that it is a
monarchy. U.S. presidents often talk of Saudi Arabia as an ally in the
promotion of democracy, a witheringly bizarre tone that runs from
liberal Democrats to arch-conservative Republicans. Trump has been
ferocious in his arms dealings. In the first half of 2018, the U.S. sold
as many weapons as it did in all of 2017. This will be a record year. It
is fated to continue in this vein. Arms will flow not only to Saudi
Arabia, but to other Arab states, parts of the world that need to dry
out from war rather than be put in the position where the gun becomes
the solution to any problem.

### Perm -- Saudia Arabia

#### Plan exposes the way Trump uses human rights as a smoke-screen for capitalism -- the perm solves better than the alternative

**Lam 19** \[Sophia Lam is a contributing author to the University of
Chicago Institute of Politics, 4-9-2019, \"Ending US Arms Sales to Saudi
Arabia,\" No Publication,
http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2019/4/9/ending-us-arms-sales-saudi-arabia/\]

**[Grand claims about the importance of arms sales to maintaining
American jobs and boosting the domestic economy are often exaggerated so
that private defense companies can keep deals that generate enormous
profit. Private sector defense workers only make up about 0.5 percent of
the total US labor force and almost none of them depend specifically on
arms sales to Saudi Arabia for their livelihood.]{.underline}** Even if
the deals ended, companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing would only
lose about 2 percent of revenue. In fact, these arms deals create
significantly more job opportunities for Saudis than for Americans.
Empirically, Trump's plan will create nearly ten thousand jobs in Saudi
ports but only five hundred US jobs overall. **[US arms sales to Saudi
Arabia have hurt the US economy by diverting funds away from better
economic growth opportunities. Investments into military jobs are often
less effective than federal spending on education, healthcare, or
infrastructure]{.underline}**. Professor Heidi Garrett-Peltier of Brown
University sums it up: **[by increasing military spending, America pays
an economic opportunity cost that sacrifices the chance to fund programs
that are better at job creation. These sectors create many more jobs
than defense spending does and can generate better value for the overall
economy]{.underline}**. If increasing job opportunities and expanding
the American economy is the priority, then, military contracts are far
from the most effective solution. Defense contractors are
economically-driven corporations that seek higher profits. To avoid the
political backlash of Saudi arms sales in their pursuits, contractors
tend to claim that they are both helping the American economy and
assisting the US government's Saudi relations. Lockheed Martin alone
will acquire about \$900 million from Saudi sales in 2020 and an
additional \$450 million contract if Saudi Arabia decides to deploy an
American ballistic missile defense system. Contractors like Lockheed
Martin are increasing revenue streams at the expense of millions of
lives in Yemen. The United States should not continue to prioritize
defense contractor business opportunities over its capability to
mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and the continuously dire
implications of Saudi Arabia weapons purchases. **[Ending the arms sales
will also lift the veil on the Trump Administration's disingenuous
economic justifications for politically expedient Saudi relations. The
Trump Administration has long used economic arguments to cover for their
political and military desires]{.underline}**. However, the arms sales
to Saudi Arabia transcend economics. By maintaining Saudi arms sales,
the United States is declining to hold countries accountable in exchange
for the comfortable benefits offered by the status quo. The
administration has attempted to simplify the arms sales issue to make
the controversy appear more palatable. **[In reality, the arms sales are
diverting American dollars to a sector that is relatively ineffective at
job development, implicitly condoning human rights abuses that stem from
those sales and harming American foreign policy itself.]{.underline}**

### Perm - Family

#### The perm solves best -- class-based oppression and family-based oppression are intertwined, but overthrowing capitalism cannot solve all of sexual oppression

Richard **Gunn** 19**87**, Richard Gunn is a political theorist that
writes many articles about Marxism "Marxism and Mediation"
<http://www.thiswasnottheplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5_marxism_mediation.pdf>,
Published July 1987

It may seem as though such a view inscribes mystification so deeply in
capitalist social reality that the emergence, from capitalism, of
revolutionary theory and practice becomes all but impossible. But
precisely the opposite is the consequence if, as we shall see,
capitalist appearances are modes of existence of relationships which are
antagonistic through and through. It is the non-dualism of the
appearance/reality relation which allows antagonisms be be matters of
experience -- to be \'glimpsed\', in Anaxagoras\'s meaning -- in however
self-contradictory and distorted a way. Once appearance is dualistically
severed from reality, by contrast, antagonism is placed outwith the
domain of experience and the basis for a politics of revolutionary
selfemancipation is undermined. As with "appearance", so with "form".
Marx\'s characteristic mode of questioning is always to ask "Why do
these things take these forms?" (e.g. Marx 1976 pp. 173-4). **[The
"things" concerned are production relations which are always, except in
communist society, class relations, i.e., relations of struggle: in
existing society it is the capital-labour which is "formed" -- which
gives form and is re-formed -- in varying ways.]{.underline}** Marx\'s
project is \'to develop from the actual, given relations of life the
forms in which these have been apotheosized\' (Marx 1976 p. 494). The
"forms" concerned are the commodity-form, the value-form, the
money-form, the wage-form, the state-form, etc. If "form" is understood
dualistically, i.e. as opposed to content which is distinct from it,
then once again (for reasons parallel to those given in connection with
"appearance") either determinism or reductionism results. In the event,
however, forms are to be understood as mediations (as modes of
existence, or appearances) of the class relation -- under capitalism,
the capital-labour relation -- and hence of the struggle in which that
relation consists. (On the centrality of class struggle to all the
categories of Capital, see Cleaver 1977**[: every single category in
Marx\'s critique of political economy is designed to contribute to the
description of the mediations -- the modes of existence -- of class
struggle, and this is one reason why Capital is to be seen as presenting
a critique of political economy rather than a rival political economy on
its own behalf]{.underline}**.) It is worth noticing that all of the
mediations set forth by Marx stand to be mediated in their turn: for
example, exchange-value is the mediation (the mode of existence or
appearance) of value, and is for its part mediated by the money-form.
For Marx, as for Hegel, no process of mediation is definitive: mediated
terms may themselves call for remediation, and far from being static or
merely "structural" the process of mediation and remediation is one in
which the praxis of class struggle -- and therefore capitalism\'s
response to labour\'s insurgency -- is inscribed. Better: mediation and
remediation are at issue in class struggle, inasmuch as mediations are
forms of class struggle. As usual, it is the categories which thematize
activity -- here, the activity of struggle -- which are given primacy by
Marx. Understood thus, the concept of mediation explodes all
deterministic readings and establishes revolutionary subjectivity at the
very centre of Marx\'s work. This being so, there can be no question of
revolutionaries having to intervene from outside (like Leninist
vanguardists) in inert social structures in order to conjure struggle
into existence or to generate praxis from process, since it is as
mediations of struggle and as at issue in struggle that social
"structures" and social "processes" exist. In this sense, for Marx as
for Hegel (and in opposition to every variety of bourgeois or
pseudo-Marxist sociology), a social world \'is not a dead essence, but
is actual and alive\' (Hegel 1977 p. 264). It follows that the politics
entailed by a reading of Marx in the light of the category of mediation
is, with Luxemburg, a politics of spontaneism: but in the Marxist
tradition Luxemburg\'s category of spontaneism has been understood no
less confusedly than the category of mediation itself. At the close of
the present paper, I shall offer brief comment on what I take the
category of spontaneism to involve. An additional virtue of the concept
of mediation is that it makes possible a theorising of the relation
between class and struggle struggles of other kinds. For example**[, the
relation of class oppression to sexual oppression has been a topic of
notorious difficulty in both feminist and Marxist thought: sexual and
class oppression are intertwined, but of course sexual oppression is
older than the capital-labour relation]{.underline}**. The necessary
insight here is to the effect that **[capitalist valorisation is not a
closed dynamic. i.e., not merely one which destroys, externally, all
\'patriarchal and idyllic\' pre-capitalist forms]{.underline}**
(although just such a view seems to be implied in, for example, the
Communist Manifesto\'s opening pages). Rather, **[it is to be seen as an
open process of totalisation which is always ready to incorporate --
viciously, voraciously -- whatever in pre-capitalism can serve its
purposes and lies ready to hand.]{.underline}** It incorporates such
elements as its own mediations, and in so doing re-"forms" them
(understanding "form", here, in the definitional sense specified above).
In this way, **[capitalism re-forms the family and transforms sexual
relations within the family into a "form" of the capital-labour relation
itself: the nuclear family comes into being cotemporally with industrial
capitalism]{.underline}** (Shorter 1976). The sexual relation becomes a
mediation of the class relation and vice versa. **[Women\'s unpaid
labour in the nuclear family serves as a free subsidy to capital so far
as the reproduction of labour-power is concerned.]{.underline}**2 Thus,
**[sexual emancipation presupposes]{.underline}**, but is not reducible
to, **[class emancipation]{.underline}** (and vice versa). This analysis
is the opposite of reductionist because it construes the process whereby
**[capital re-forms sexual relations as one of struggle and implies
neither that all of existing sexual oppression is a consequence of this
re-formation -- although it is all affected by it -- nor that sexual
oppression will be automatically terminated once the capital-labour
relation is]{.underline}**

### Perm - Demilitarization

#### Perm Do Both -- recognition of the ethical justifications behind policy is not incompatible with a process of demilitarization -- even if the aff isn't perfect it's a step in the right direction, only the perm resolves the self-fulfilling prophecies produced by the military industrial complex.

**[The military is both a state agency and a highly profitable sector
within industrialized economies due to weapons manufacturing and the
international trade in arms. Governments of countries with arms
industries pay for weapons production twice over.]{.underline}** Public
funds underwrite the often decades-long development process for complex
weapons systems, and governments are the sole customers for them. Steven
Staples argues that the large U.S. military budget \"is for all
practical purposes a corporate subsidy\" siphoning public money into
private hands, and protected under Article XXI of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which allows \"governments free reign for
actions taken for national security interests.\" **[Staples argues that
with global economic integration the \"weakened state no longer has the
ability to reign in weapons corporations, and is trapped increasingly by
corporate interests: greater military spending, state subsidies, and a
liberalization of the arms trade.\"]{.underline}** Tamar Gabelnick and
Anna Rich take up the issue of the arms trade in the fifth article. They
emphasize potential contradictions between security policy and
international arms sales, noting that \"**[U.S. arms export policy was
established to protect national security, but has become increasingly
focused on commercial interests\"]{.underline}** such that \"proposed
export reforms will lead to further loss of control over conventional
arms proliferation.\" An outcome of international sales is that
militaries can find themselves up against an enemy armed with weapons
provided by their own governments if political and military alliances
shift. This happened to Britain in the Falklands/Malvinas war and to the
United States in the Persian Gulf War. In an attempt to reduce arms
sales, U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney has proposed a **[Code of
Conduct that would restrict the sale of arms to countrie]{.underline}**s
**[that are \"nondemocratic, aggressors, human rights abusers, or not
open about their military spending.\"]{.underline}** **[This is a step
in the right direction]{.underline}**, but as Gabelnick and Rich
suggest, **[it will need to be applied consistently to have much
impact.]{.underline}** The definitions of nondemocratic, aggression, or
human rights abuse are open to interpretation. Russia\'s assurance, for
example, \"that it will not sell offensive weapons to Iran despite
\[its\] decision.. .to resume arms sales to Teheran\" (Reuters, December
7, 2000: A16) suggests a clear-cut distinction between offensive and
defensive weapons that may be meaningless in practice. Many countries
are involved in arms trading. **[Most people are killed by small arms
that are cheap and easily available worldwide, rather than by highly
sophisticated weaponry. A good deal of the cross-border trade in small
arms is illegal, but highly profitable for manufacturers, dealers,
brokers, shippers, and financiers]{.underline}** (Lumpe, 2000). This
trade is an important way for poorer countries to earn hard currency to
repay foreign debt. Staples notes that \"foreign embassies and trade
missions abroad are used to aid arms sales,\" a point reiterated by
Karen Talbot, who argues that [\"bombing and missile strikes, are, more
than ever, giant bazaars for selling the wares of the armaments
manufacturers.\" The Persian Gulf War and the bombing of Kosovo allowed
stocks to be displayed, tested, and reduced somewhat.]{.underline}
William Greider (1998) argues that there is no technical reason to
update U.S. weapons the most sophisticated in the world except for the
need for continued profits. He notes that the **[biggest enemy of future
U.S. weapons production is the copious supply of weapons already in
existence; hence, the need to use them so as to justify continued
production.]{.underline}**

[Between \$19 billion and \$29 billion in illicit proceeds flow from the
United States to drug trafficking organizations and other organized
criminal groups in Mexico each year, according to a 2010 Homeland
Security study]{.underline}.77 Smuggling of bulk cash, use of stored
value cards and laundering through financial institutions are common
forms of illicit flows. Although some border programs fund operations to
stop bulk cash smuggling, programs to track and confiscate illegal flows
within the United States and anti-money-laundering programs have been
underfunded, especially relative to resources spent abroad on the
Mexican military, police and intelligence forces**[. The new security
paradigm of "shared responsibility" recognizes the U.S. role, but has
led to policies that continue to be focused on Mexican
enforcement.]{.underline}** Although the second phase of the Merida
Initiative changes the emphasis to "institution-building", military and
police support continues to dominate funding and actions. Moreover,
U.S.-mandated vetting of police forces has been slow and ineffective and
justice reform at the federal level has also stalled, according to the
CRS report. In states where judicial reform has progressed, like
Chihuahua, the results are less positive than hoped. **[The lack of
progress responds to technical difficulties, but primarily is a result
of failing to take into account the lack of political will for reform
and key differences between the Mexican and U.S. systems.]{.underline}**
Astoundingly, the 21st Century border modernization pillar of the Merida
Initiative does not address the problem of corruption---the problem at
the heart of contraband smuggling on both sides of the border.78
**[Mexico has also rightfully pointed out that uncontrolled arms
smuggling out of the United States into Mexico has exacerbated violence
there. While part of the problem is the ease with which guns are
purchased in the U.S., another part is deficiencies in law enforcement
regarding crossborder smuggling]{.underline}**. Universal background
checks and effective inspection at the border is needed to stem the flow
of illegal arms to Mexican drug cartels. The Merida Initiative and
foreign aid to Mexico as a whole must be reviewed before proceeding with
a policy that has produced so much bloodshed and human suffering without
producing desired results. Recently the Senate Appropriations Committee
froze funds, citing a lack of strategy on the part of both the U.S. and
Mexican governments. In our opinion, this assessment is correct and
should be heeded as a sign to rethink U.S. policy. A GAO report of July
2010 on the Merida initiative found it lacked benchmarks to measure
success.79 **[This is no small flaw for a major policy, especially in
the area of security. With current confusion over whether the goal is
national security, citizen security or public safety---all requiring
different focuses---it is essential to establish a clearer and shared
conception and to enable facts-based evaluations to ascertain whether
goals are being met.]{.underline}** What can be **[said at present is
that the drug war in Mexico has failed in most performance
measures]{.underline}**. It has exacerbated insecurity among the Mexican
population and led to fears of greater violence in the United States as
a consequence. **[It has eroded rather than supported rule of law by
detonating turf battles between cartels that play out in the
streets]{.underline}** and overwhelm an already severely crippled
justice system. **[It has done little to stop corruption on either side
of the border]{.underline}**. Meanwhile studies show the supply of
illicit drugs has continued without significant change. The Mexican and
U.S. governments have declared that the relationship between the two
nations goes beyond security. Indeed no two nations are as deeply
integrated economically, socially and culturally as the two North
American neighbors. **[However, our binational policy is directed at
security policy that defines Mexico as a threat to national security and
leads to a military and police build up at the expense of citizen
security and democracy]{.underline}**. This must change. Policy

### Boycotts good

#### Attempts at ethical consumerism have serous economic and political effects -- boycotts solve

**Stolle, Hooghe, Micheletti 2005** (Dietlind Stolle, Marc Hooghe, and
Michele Micheletti; Stolle received a PhD from Princeton, Hooghe is a
professor of political science at the University of Leuven, Micheletti
is a Lars Hierta Professor of Political Science at Stockholm University;
2005; International Political Science Review (2005) "Politics in the
Supermarket: Political Consumerism as a Form of Political
Participation";
[https://doi.org/10.1177/0192512105053784](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0192512105053784)
)

In the early months of 2003, the French government, together with the
governments of Germany, Belgium, and Russia, firmly opposed the approval
of a UN Security Council resolution allowing the use of military force
against Iraq. The position of President Jacques Chirac and his
government was greeted with hostility by a significant cross-section of
US public opinion. This anti-French sentiment did not lead to any form
of political involvement, at least not if we limit our consideration to
the standard repertoire of political participation in contemporary
industrial societies. There was no street violence before the French
embassy, the newspapers did not report any demonstrations against
President Chirac, nor were there any other protest events. Therefore,
the mainstream approach to the study of political action and
participation would seem to argue that nothing of significance happened
at all (Koopmans and Rucht, 2002). Nevertheless, this approach to the
study of political behavior misses an important part of the story**[. A
number of US restaurants dropped French wine from their menus; various
shops decided to stop selling French cheese; and some food-outlets even
rechristened "French fries" as "freedom fries." Americans opposed to the
French position apparently did not take to the streets to express their
views, and instead decided to use their purchasing power to hurt French
exports]{.underline}** (Barroux, 2003). These kinds of **[consumer
boycott campaigns have become commonplace in recent years. Some of
them]{.underline}**, such as the example discussed above, **[use
business targets to voice criticism of government actions (Linton,
2003). Other consumer boycotts focus specifically on the policies and
practices of corporations.]{.underline}** The oil multinational Shell
has been repeatedly targeted because of its environmental practices and
human rights policy in Nigeria as well as its use of oil tankers that do
not conform to international safety standards (Jordan, 2001). Nike, in
addition to other footwear and clothing companies, have been taken to
task for their use of child labor as well as the poor working conditions
their workers face in various Asian countries. Israel, France, the USA,
and South Africa have at one time or another been targeted by political
boycott campaigns. **[The use of consumer decisions as an instrument in
political campaigns can also result in a call to buy certain goods and
services that conform to the aims of the campaign in
question.]{.underline}** Labeling schemes for organic food, fair-trade
products, environmentally friendly products and production methods, and
ethical banking are examples of this positive face of "political
consumerism" (Levi and Linton, 2003; Micheletti, 2003a). **[When people
engage in boycotts or "buycotts" with the aim of using the market to
vent their political concerns, they are said to engage in the act of
political consumerism.]{.underline}** This, for our purposes, can be
defined as *consumer choice of producers and products based on political
or ethical considerations, or both* (Micheletti et al., 2003). Political
consumers choose particular producers or products because they want to
change institutional or market practices. They make their choices based
on considerations of justice or fairness, or on an assessment of
business and government practices. Regardless of whether political
consumers act individually or collectively, their market choices reflect
an understanding of material products as embedded in a complex social
and normative context, which can be called the politics behind products
(Micheletti, 2003a). Clearly, together with several other emerging forms
of political participation, boycotts have risen in countries where we
can compare participation trends over time. The signing of petitions was
very widespread at the end of the 20th century, and a large proportion
of citizens also participated in demonstrations. The involvement in
boycotts has steadily increased over time as well, and, in fact, it is
the form of political participation that experienced the strongest
growth over time, as the ratios in Figure 1 indicate. Participation in
boycotts is more than four times as likely in 1999 compared to 1974,
whereas for all other forms growth has been at a lower rate. Political
consumerism is particularly visible in Scandinavia, where scholars have
studied the phenomenon for several decades. The Swedish Study of Power
and Democracy found that using boycotts for societal and political
purposes (within the past 12 months) had increased from 15 percent in
1987 to 29 percent in 1997 (Petersson et al., 1998: 55). Boycotting
ranked third as a form of political participation in both the 1987 and
1997 surveys, making it a more frequent form than contacting civil
servants, a civil society association, a politician, or a media actor,
or working in a political party or civil society association. It was
outranked only by signing a petition and contributing financially to a
cause (Petersson et al., 1998: 55). By 2002, it was found that 33
percent of Swedes had boycotted a product in the past 12 months, and 55
percent had deliberately bought a product for political, ethical, or
environmental reasons (European Social Survey, 2002). However, political
consumerism is not evenly spread in western democracies, a fact which
itself merits further investigation. These **[survey data clearly
indicate that a growing number of citizens are turning to the market to
express their political and moral concerns, but do not tell us whether
political consumerism can also be considered as a meaningful or
effective form of political participation. For this, we turn to
historical examples, which show that political consumer activism can be
an effective way of changing both corporate and governmental policy and
behavior. Political consumerism clearly has had an impact on industry
standards, pushing awareness about the need for codes of conduct and
labeling schemes]{.underline}**. Advocacy and public disclosure
campaigns are proving successful in the global garment industry (Rock,
2003). **[Some boycotts]{.underline}** (for instance, the famous 1955
Montgomery bus boycott in protest against racial segregation in the USA)
**[have broken "the cycles of history" by opening up agendas and arenas
for alternative visions and information]{.underline}** (Friedman, 1999;
Keck and Sikkink, 1998; Micheletti, 2003a**[). A well-known effective
boycott occurred against Nestlé (1977--84) for its marketing of baby
milk substitute or infant formula in the third world. This boycott
mobilized consumers globally, and this mobilization, along with the
publicity it received, brought Nestlé, a corporation promoting itself as
oriented toward family values and with a high market visibility, to the
World Health Organization and United Nations International Children's
Emergency Fund negotiating table. In 1981, the International Code of
Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes was adopted]{.underline}**. However,
political consumerist groups were not satisfied with the code's
implementation and reinstated the boycott in 1988 (Bar Yam, 1995;
Sikkink, 1986). **[Boycotts, public disclosure, and advocacy work that
have been instigated by fair- trade and anti-sweatshop groups because of
working conditions in the global garment industry are also starting to
pay off. Studies show that the apparel industry is very sensitive to
this kind of political consumerist criticism.]{.underline}** Public
disclosure of firms' sweatshop practices not only mobilizes consumers
who contact industry representatives directly and engage in protest
activities, but can also affect firms' stock prices negatively, which
encourages them to respond by announcing their own codes of conduct and
by participating in associations that work with corporate social
responsibility. These endeavors are a kind of "good" news that leads to
a more positive market response (Rock, 2003: 26, 29). In particular**[,
Nike has been affected by both political consumerist activism and the
publicity it has received in the media. Watchdog groups have forced Nike
to follow Indonesian law and raise its wage levels, change its sourcing
of soccer balls to avoid child labor, increase the minimum age of its
factory workers abroad, and insist that all outsourced footwear
suppliers adopt US occupational safety and health standards for indoor
air quality (Locke, 2003: 11--19). In the USA, political consumerist
activism has spurred the government to take legal and legislative
actions]{.underline}** as well as forge partnerships between business,
the anti-sweatshop movement, and consumers (Adams, 2002; Emmelhainz,
1999).

### AT: Communism - Israel

#### Even if their historical analysis of class is precise the history of communist political alternatives in Palestine has been centered on a nationalism inherent to orthodox Marxist philosophies which has made liberation more difficult for Palestinians. Their advocacy is coopted by national which turns all their offense -- the anti-state politics of the aff is key.

**Khalidi 2018 (**Raja, Research Coordinator at the Palestine Economic
Policy Research Institute, "Nation and Class: Generations of Palestinian
Liberation", Rethinking Marxism, volume 30, issue 3**)**

I focus here on **[the position and influence of Palestinian Communist
and Marxist tendencies over the past seventy years because their awkward
straddling of the gulf between Palestinian national and social
liberation is emblematic of the paradoxical and]{.underline}**, I would
contend, **[increasingly tense balance between the questions of nation
and class in Palestine today]{.underline}**. On the one hand, they have
accepted relegating social revolution to a subordinate position as long
as the national struggle remains inconclusive, all the while conceding
that Israeli self-determination must be accepted as legitimate. On the
other hand, various strains of Arab and international socialist (or
Third World liberationist) agendas and alliances have dominated PLO
political positioning, helping to keep the movement on the left of
history until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the one country where
Palestinian Communists were free to operate uninterruptedly since 1948
(Israel), working-class demands went side by side on their agenda with
those advocating national rights for the Palestinian people in a
twostate format (Beinin 1990). **[But the real prospects for achieving
socialism in Israel, or even equal civil and cultural rights, are
perhaps dimmer than they have ever been. PLO trade unions in exile and
inside Palestine have organized and advocated for workers,
professionals, women, and student groups by occasionally advancing
social demands, but they have disingenuously focused on mobilizing
people for the national-liberation struggle. In an ironic twist, through
their adherence to the Marxist orthodoxy on national self-determination,
Palestinian Communists have constituted one of the most influential
forces in delaying Palestinian social-liberation
struggles.]{.underline}** In that respect, at least, the bourgeois
patriotism of Fatah has been more consistent and coherent than the
intellectual acrobatics that Palestinian Marxist, Leninist, Stalinist,
and Maoist schools of thought have deployed. While Fatah has always
dominated the political system's institutions and decisions in the
power-sharing deal between PLO factions, Palestinian socialist
formations have accepted a limited share and role therein. As in other
Third World experiences, **[their disillusioned former leaders have
often become avid supporters of PNA economic policy, with unwavering
adherence to achieving a two-state solution through political and
diplomatic nonviolent processes]{.underline}**.7 The continued
acquiescence of the Palestinian Left in the political and socioeconomic
system begat by Oslo provides legitimacy to Fatah and its allied
leadership, just as the national bourgeoisie's capital investments
provide material strength to the system and to PLO economic strategies
set up to deal with Israeli asymmetric containment policies (Khan 2004).
The persistence of a broad national front (the Hamas breakaway
notwithstanding) has entailed commitment both to the two-state formula
(despite all realities on the ground to the contrary) and to the
principles of the open-market economy that the PNA was destined to
manage once the Paris Protocol on Economic Relations was agreed upon
between Israel and the PLO in 1994 (UNCTAD 2006). Several decades down
the road, **[it is evident that, however unacceptable any of the
alternatives might have been, Palestinian Communists' and nationalists'
diehard belief in the necessity and inevitability of the two-state
solution has been, at best, misplaced and, at worst, deceptive toward
the Palestinian people's interests. More injurious perhaps to a
long-suffering people has been the idea that the achievement of
essential social, economic, and civil rights will have to wait until
after national independence. Until that happens, a strong dose of
liberal market economics has been adopted as the best formula to ensure
a measure of individual prosperity, even while communal impoverishment
and national economic dependence on the colonial power
persists]{.underline}** (Khalidi and Samour 2011).

### BDS Perm

#### Perm Solves -- BDS combines Marxist theories of solidarity with strategic framings of oppression to produce global movements across racial class and gendered lines. The call for BDS from the global north leverages the histories of oppression against contemporary forms of imperialism -- voting aff aligns with a real life struggle against state violence.

**Ananth 2014 (**Sriram, writer activist and trauma-therapist,
"Conceptualizing solidarity and realizing struggle: testing against the
Palestinian call for the boycott of Israel", Interface: a journal for
and about social movements, Volume 6 (2): 143 -- 163, November**)**

So, how can all of the above be related to the Palestinian call for BDS?
I will start by reverting back to the two moments of solidarity at play
in the call. The first is the manner in which the "Palestinian people"
are defined, which **[is at once predicated against the common
oppression that Shelby speaks of in his understanding of black
solidarity, that Mohanty speaks of when speaking of solidarity among
women workers, and crucially also very similar to the basic manner in
which class-solidarity as conceived of by Marxist thought is
constructed, i.e. based on common material interests. But it is also
predicated against a reductionist, homogenized national identity similar
to the kind of nationalism that Pasture and Verberckmoes critique in
their examination of working-class internationalism.]{.underline}** It
is important to understand however that **[this definition is
strategic,]{.underline}** i.e. deployed by the BDS call specifically
**[in order to construct a notion of solidarity with them as an
oppressed whole, based on the fact that all Palestinians, regardless of
differences among them, face oppression of varying kinds and intensities
at the hands of the Israeli state. The second moment of solidarity is in
the solidarity that the BDS calls for from the international
community.]{.underline}** Here too, there are resonances with Marxist
understandings of class-solidarity, because the Palestinian call for the
BDS of Israel that seeks to bring down the structures of oppression that
Palestinians suffer, albeit in varied manners, as a cultural-national
people, will (at least theoretically) undo an "essential cause for
discord" (Pasture and Verberckmoes, 1998: 3) between Palestinian and
Israeli workers, which falls fully within a Marxist notion of
class-solidarity, even if that is clearly not the stated aim of the
call. **[However the kind of solidarity that the BDS call seeks from the
international community has as much relevance with feminist reflexivity,
love, faith, and attention to difference, because it is seeking
solidarity from people clearly identified by the call itself as being
outside of the immediate realm of oppression that the Palestinians are
under.]{.underline}** In other words **[it seeks to leverage the
privilege of Palestine-solidarity activists in the Global North,
privilege that is no doubt a result of imperialist and colonial
structures of oppression, in order to dismantle a form of apartheid,
colonialism, and military occupation that is rooted in those very same
structures of oppression.]{.underline}** The BDS call does this because
it accounts for the gargantuan apparatus of support the Israeli state
enjoys in the Global North in this current day and age. It is an
apparatus of support that is consistent with the instrumentality of US
imperialism, and hence bolstered politically, economically, socially,
and culturally by the same actors and powers-that-be that reproduce US
imperialism. **[The Palestine-solidarity movement cannot ever hope to
compete with the vast social, political, and economic resources of the
pro-Israel forces in the US. Hence the call and the movement it has
borne, warts and all, has adopted the strategy of intervening in
mainstream cultural discourse by strategically occupying the moral high
ground, achieved in part by leveraging the privilege of activists in the
Global North. It's problematic. It's difficult. It's messy. It's also
real life.]{.underline}** The contradictions are there for anyone to
see. It's not immaculate, but no reallife struggle resisting oppression
can afford to be lest they risk complete and utter marginalization.
**[Part of the reason why the BDS movement has continued to be a thorn
in the side of the enormously powerful pro-Israel forces is precisely
because, in addition to being a fundamentally anti-oppressive movement,
it is a strategically astute one.]{.underline}** This is why
**[theoretical explorations of solidarity need to be constantly tested
against real struggles that occupy different realms of socioeconomic and
spatial difference.]{.underline}** Workers in the same shop floor have
an immediate common material interest in organizing in class-solidarity
with each other, as do Palestinians in Ramallah or Jerusalem organizing
in national-solidarity with each other against Israeli oppression. When
activists outside of those immediate material conditions act in
solidarity with them, the commonality of interests becomes more abstract
and less immediate. It can be argued that activists organizing in
solidarity with workers in a shop floor they don't work in is ultimately
in resistance to the machinations of capital that bear down on them as
well, but it is not within the immediate realm of the specific material
interests of those workers. Similarly it can be argued that by
organizing in solidarity with Palestinian struggles for
self-determination, activists are organizing in resistance to
imperialism and colonialism that has significant implications to them as
well. Seen in this way, **[solidarity can be conceived of as not
necessarily being only rooted in a pre-assigned idea of common material
conditions, but more importantly an investment in an ever evolving idea
of common material politics.]{.underline}** The BDS call at once
occupies different spatial and socioeconomic levels. **[The
socioeconomic conditions inherent in the definition of the Palestinian
people, while not accounting for differences within the Palestinian
people, is very different than the socioeconomic and spatial conditions
of the international community in the Global North that the BDS call is
calling for solidarity from]{.underline}**. Similarly the spatial
aspects of Israelis, themselves members of the Global North, who respond
in solidarity to the BDS call is very different than solidarity
activists in other parts of the Global North. This can have important
implications for the BDS movement itself. Seen in this manner, **[the
BDS call provides an interesting platform to understand that it is in
the lived politics of solidarity-based struggle that one is able to
determine where greater attention to difference is needed, where
commonality of interests lies, and how to engage with the contradictions
arising from different forms of solidarity for a transformative
political movement (and the messiness therein).]{.underline}**

#### The 1ac is BDS Activism not the BDS Movement -- Demands and Campaigns for the reduction of arms -- ethical individual strategies of political orientation like the affirmative don't trade off with the production of collectivity, investment in the "BDS Movement" produces fault activism that their link arguments are in the context of.

WAINWRIGHT AND NIR: In recent years many activists for justice in
Palestine have placed great emphasis on BDS (Boycott, Divestment,
Sanctions). You have criticized this strategy as misguided.9 As we
understand your position, the basic problem is that a boycott of Israeli
universities and firms is unlikely to change the concrete circumstances
facing Palestinians. **[Are there ways that the BDS strategy could be
refocused and refined to bring about genuine results for
Palestinians?]{.underline}** CHOMSKY: That's not quite accurate. As the
cited article makes clear and explicit, I've been supporting and indeed
directly engaged in BDS efforts since well before the "BDS movement" was
founded in 2005, and continue to support these efforts. The article does
discuss some truisms in activist circles: in particular, that **["those
who are sincerely dedicated to the Palestinian cause should avoid
illusion and myth, and think carefully about the tactics they choose and
the course they follow." It then discusses the tactics that have been
successful since BDS efforts were initiated]{.underline}** by Uri
Avneri's Gush Shalom in 1997, and those that have failed, and why.10 The
reasons discussed are not primarily those that you mention. **[The
successful tactics are those that focus on the occupation and on the
support for the occupation by Western multinationals: the initiatives of
the Presbyterian Church, for example. These tactics can gain broad
support and also have a crucial educational function]{.underline}**, 9.

serving as a basis for successful organizing and activism for policy
changes. Other efforts, such as academic boycott, are often harmful to
the victims, eliciting a backlash that overwhelms the efforts, diverting
attention from Israeli crimes to irrelevant issues of academic freedom,
and the like, and raising obvious questions of hypocrisy: why not
boycott American universities, since U.S. crimes vastly exceed those of
Israel? Such **[discussions about tactical choices and their
consequences for the victims are normal and essential in serious
activist movements]{.underline}**. **[It is rather curious that the "BDS
movement"---to be distinguished from those engaged in BDS
activism---often seems to interpret normal debate about choice of
tactics and effects on victims as an illegitimate departure from
orthodoxy. Not helpful to the victims, to say the least. Pursuit of the
successful tactics, focusing on the occupation, can proceed much
further: for example, to efforts to enforce the Leahy Amendment that
bars military support for forces engaged in systematic human rights
violations, surely applicable to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). And
indeed, arms embargo on Israel has been advocated by leading human
rights organizations, including Amnesty International. Even a modest
campaign for such objectives could have significant impact on U.S. and
Israeli policies.]{.underline}** And there are many more examples.

#### BDS is key to international calls for liberation -- naming the oppressor and taking strategic political actions produces concrete effects on policy and shifts cultural perceptions towards violence, all necessary strategies in the building of the alternative's global movement.

Ananth 2013 **(**Sriram, writer activist and trauma-therapist, "The
Politics of the Palestinian BDS Movement
<http://sdonline.org/63/the-politics-of-the-palestinian-bds-movement/>,
#63 Volume 27, no. 3, November, 2013**)**

The framework of oppression laid out by the BDS call is brought to focus
through its demands. **[The BDS call identifies a tripartite structure
of oppression: Colonialism (marked by the demand for the Right of Return
of Palestinian refugees and an end to colonization), Apartheid (marked
by the demand for full equality of Palestinians in Israel), and
Occupation (marked by the demand for an end to the occupation and the
dismantling of the wall). It also lays out a clear definition of the
oppressor institution (the Israeli state) to be targeted non-violently
with BDS until the oppressed people (Palestinians) are liberated.
Finally, it clearly defines what liberation from said oppressor means in
material terms, again clearly reflected in demands that reflect all
three systems of oppression that together constitute what the
Palestinian people as a pre-defined cultural-national entity suffer.
Thus it clearly defines the framework of oppression and the framework of
liberation.]{.underline}** What **[the BDS movement]{.underline}**
represents, and **[is calling for,]{.underline}** is **[a transformative
praxis of emancipatory resistance that matches the evolving
socio-spatial apparatus of oppression.]{.underline}** This oppression is
the Israeli state strongly supported by numerous international allies,
the United States being the most powerful of them, and a large, powerful
Israeli lobby outside the national territory of Israel. The call
understands that **[the political-economic sources of the oppression of
Palestinians exist beyond the specific geographic boundaries of the
state of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.]{.underline}**
At play in the Palestinian call for BDS are two clear notions of
solidarity. One, **[it defines the Palestinian people against a
tripartite structure of oppression consisting of colonialism, apartheid
and military occupation that has been suffered by them as a
cultural-national entity.]{.underline}** Two, in opposition to this
historic injustice**[, it makes an emotive call for solidarity from
"international civil society organizations and people of conscience all
over the world," outside of that cultural-national entity, to boycott
Israel until the oppression ends with the implementation of their three
demands]{.underline}**. This includes a specific invitation to
"conscientious Israelis to support this Call, for the sake of justice
and genuine peace." Thus there are three entities -- an oppressed people
defined, an oppressor institution identified, and everyone else called
to stand in solidarity with the oppressed people. **[The call thus
represents an urgent attempt, among others, to create an alternative
socio-spatial imaginary that strives to match and struggle against that
oppression through a call for solidarity]{.underline}**. This
alternative socio-spatial imaginary is framed in the three demands that
the call clearly states, with the idea that solidarity-based BDS
measures must be implemented until the demands are met. This is however
not a new concept or strategy, and **[the BDS movement is inspired by
another boycott movement that was rather successful in getting its
demands met. This is crucial to understanding the possibilities that the
BDS movement offers]{.underline}**, not only for the liberation of the
Palestinian people, but also liberation struggles in general, **[and the
obvious fear it evokes in the powers-that-be...because it has worked
before. The Palestinian BDS call was inspired by solidarity-calls for
the boycott of Apartheid-era South Africa.]{.underline}** The African
National Congress and other groups fighting apartheid in South Africa
had issued calls for boycotting South Africa until Apartheid ended,
starting with Albert Luthuli's call in 1959, and derived from the ANC's
Freedom Charter.32 These were taken up in a variety of ways over the
years through anti-Apartheid movements in the West, the global Artists
United Against Apartheid, different Third World governments in the UN
working to institute the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid, and
campaigns in the Commonwealth countries to implement the highly
successful sports boycott. The sports boycott was particularly crucial
in isolating South Africa from two of its most popular sports, cricket
and rugby. The cricket boards in former colonized countries like India,
Pakistan, and the Caribbean nations took the lead in the cricket
boycott, while the New Zealand group Halt All Racist Tours played an
important role in spurring the rugby boycott. India also boycotted the
1974 Davis Cup tennis final against South Africa.33 **[The leaders of
the South African anti-apartheid movement realized early on that
international boycott would be a useful tool in their fight against
apartheid. While the degree of influence is difficult to assess, one
cannot avoid the fact that the boycott movement played a key role in
bringing down the legal structures of apartheid in the
country.]{.underline}** There are, of course, differences between the
situations in Palestine/Israel and South Africa, both in objective
conditions and subjective forces, with sheer numbers being possibly the
most crucial. Black South Africans were and continue to be the
overwhelming majority in the country, so when they took on a boycott of
White South African institutions, including mass labor strikes, it was
bound to have major effects. Indeed, the ANC's labor struggles were
hugely important in bringing down apartheid, because White South African
capitalists relied heavily on the exploitation of Black labor.34 This is
not the case in Palestine/Israel. Palestinian citizens of Israel are
around 20% of the population, and even if one includes Palestinians in
the Occupied Territories, it still only adds up to around the same
number as the Jewish population of Israel. The Israeli economy used to
be fairly dependent on exploiting Palestinian labor from the Occupied
Territories, but this has changed with Israel reducing its dependence on
Palestinian labor35 by importing labor from South and Southeast Asia,
thus preventing a South Africa-like situation of Palestinian labor
strikes from threatening the status quo of a Zionist state. However,
**[akin to the South African boycott movement and a form of
internationalism (not unlike the proletarian kind), the Palestinian BDS
call has spawned numerous solidarity-based movements across the world,
whether via existing Palestine-solidarity movements implementing BDS
campaigns or in the birth of new ones. In fact, given the differences,
there is reason to believe that BDS may be even more effective in the
liberation of the Palestinian people than it was in the liberation of
Black South Africans. The different BDS campaigns together with the BDS
leadership in Palestine form the heterogeneous global BDS movement, a
movement whose campaigns operate independently from each other, while
maintaining some coordinating mechanisms.]{.underline}** The solidarity
campaigns that emerged in response to the BDS call have been primarily
based in the West, though many have emerged in South Africa and West
Asian countries, with nascent campaigns starting in India, Pakistan, and
Southeast Asia too. **[The solidarity campaigns in the West are the ones
causing the maximum consternation to the Israeli state and its
supporting apparatus. These have spanned the spectrum of BDS campaigns,
and include academic boycott, cultural boycott, sanctions, and economic
divestment.36They have primarily emerged out of existing
Palestine-solidarity networks and the larger peace movement. They are
heterogeneous and volunteer-driven, but are also coalescing into a logic
of their own, derived primarily from a shared unity under the rubric of
the BDS call.]{.underline}** The BDS movement also faces gargantuan
opposition. In terms of strategy, almost all the campaigns have to take
into account backlash from the existing apparatus of support for the
Israeli state, including the US polity. **[The movement is unlike other
solidarity-based movements in the Western world because of the
cultural-hegemonic stranglehold the Zionist lobby has over mainstream
discourse, primarily in the US and Europe.]{.underline}** Because of
this stranglehold, the BDS call asks for people to take a stand, an
uncompromising position where good intentions alone will not suffice,
because those good intentions can be swept up by establishment
discourse. In a sense, what **[the BDS call is saying is that you cannot
hedge when it comes to resisting oppression, even at times when nuanced
hedging seems reasonable.]{.underline}** Noam Chomsky and Uri Avnery,
both progressive thinkers highly critical of Israel, found themselves
reinforcing an oppressive status quo precisely because they hedged.
Chomsky, while calling for universities to boycott companies doing
business in Israel, was not in favor of academic boycott itself, instead
calling on Western academics to utilize other means to fight Israel's
atrocities; Avnery went with the liberal Zionist argument of
distinguishing between the occupation/settlements and the Israeli state
as a whole, even surreptitiously playing the anti-Semite card.37 **[The
BDS call essentially tells us there is no hedging until the oppression
stops, no matter how uncomfortable it might get to the Western,
liberal-rationalist mind for which nuanced hedging is a privilege that
those facing multiple forms of oppression cannot afford.]{.underline}**
The possibilities the BDS movement offers to any solidarity-based
struggle -- class, nationalist, gender, anti-colonial, anti-imperialist
or any other -- are not necessarily unique or new, but they should be
stated regardless**[. The demands are critical to a clear understanding
of what liberation means. Liberation is not an abstract concept, nor is
it a utopian one. Liberation has to be grounded in material reality;
thus, the stand that the BDS call asks people to take is one of actual
material conditions rather than easy platitudes.]{.underline}**

#### Calls to bds movement conceptualize binaries that exceed limited dimensions of class that produce solidarity across different subject positions

Ananth 2013 **(**Sriram, writer activist and trauma-therapist, "The
Politics of the Palestinian BDS Movement
<http://sdonline.org/63/the-politics-of-the-palestinian-bds-movement/>,
#63 Volume 27, no. 3, November, 2013**)**

In that spirit of solidarity in real-life struggles I would like to
conclude by reverting back to the two moments of solidarity at play in
the call. The first is **[the manner in which the "Palestinian people"
are defined]{.underline}**. This **[is predicated against a common
oppressor (in this case the Israeli state), similar to understandings of
black solidarity that were explored during black liberation
struggles]{.underline}**,38 **[or to solidarity among women
workers,]{.underline}**39 **[and crucially also very similar to the
basic manner in which class-solidarity is conceived of by Marxist
thought, i.e. based on common material interests, which in Marxism are
broadly dependent on a person's relationship to the means of
production]{.underline}**.40 But the definition of "Palestinian people"
is also based on the logic of a national identity similar to the kind of
nationalism that is critiqued as potentially damaging to working-class
internationalism.41It is important to understand **[that this notion of
"Palestinian people" is deployed by the BDS call specifically in order
to construct a notion of solidarity with Palestinians as an oppressed
whole, based on the fact that all Palestinians, regardless of
differences among them, face numerous forms of oppression at the hands
of the Israeli state. The second moment of solidarity is that which the
BDS movement calls for from the international community]{.underline}**.
Here too, one can see consistency with other forms of solidarity like
that of class, because **[the Palestinian call that]{.underline}** seeks
to end the oppression **[that Palestinians suffer as a cultural-national
people will (at least theoretically) undo the contradiction between
Palestinian and Israeli workers]{.underline}**, which falls fully within
any notion of class-solidarity, even if that is not the stated aim of
the call. However the kind of solidarity that the BDS call seeks from
the international community **[is just as vital as feminist and other
forms of solidarity because it is seeking solidarity from people clearly
identified by the call itself as being outside of the immediate realm of
oppression that the Palestinians are under.]{.underline}** The BDS call
thus also tells us that **[theoretical calls for solidarity need to be
constantly tested against real-life struggles that occupy different
socioeconomic and spatial realms]{.underline}**. Workers on the same
shop floor have an immediate common material interest in organizing in
class-solidarity with each other, as do Palestinians in Ramallah and
Jerusalem organizing in national-solidarity with each other against
Israeli oppression. **[When activists outside of those immediate
material conditions act in solidarity with them, the commonality of
interests becomes more abstract and less immediate, but remains
important as an investment in common material politics.]{.underline}**
The BDS call occupies distinct spatial and socioeconomic levels. **[The
socioeconomic and spatial conditions inherent in the Palestinian people,
while not accounting for differences among them, differ markedly from
the socioeconomic and spatial conditions of the international community
in the Global North (including Israeli society) whose solidarity the BDS
movement is calling for]{.underline}**. Seen in this manner, **[the BDS
call provides an interesting platform to understand that it is in the
lived politics of solidarity-based struggle that one is able to
determine where greater attention to difference is needed, where
commonality of interests lies, and how to engage with the contradictions
arising from different forms of solidarity for a transformative
political movement]{.underline}**. Above all, **[it is a movement that
will not stop until liberation is achieved,]{.underline}** through
multiple highs and lows, **[because it is based on an ironclad set of
simple demands meant to dismantle the structures of oppression through
strategic expressions of solidarity.]{.underline}**

### University Key - Israel

#### The reality and history of the university makes activism and challenges to power uniquely key -- especially true in the context of BDS

**Marez 2014 (**Curtis, Professor in the Ethnic Studies Department at
the UC San Diego, "Seeing in the Red: Looking at Student Debt", American
Quarterly, Volume 66, Number 2, June 2014, pp. 261-281**)**

Chatterjee and Maira argue that **[universities are complicit in the
history and present reality of US settler colonialism, which shapes, for
example, post-9/11 knowledge production but also efforts to limit
dissent from the US war on terror and US support for the Israeli
occupation of Palestinian territories, including student and faculty
calls for boycott, divestment, and sanction.]{.underline}** Indeed, the
history and present context of US universities overlaps with the history
and present context of US settler colonialism in multiple ways. In his
remarkable Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the Troubled History of
America's Universities, Craig Steven Wilder argues **[that settler
colonialism and slavery were materially and ideologically intertwined
with the founding and consolidation of powerful northeastern
universities]{.underline}** such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth,
and the University of Pennsylvania from the colonial period to the mid
early nineteenth century.41Ebony and Ivy demonstrates that **[colonial
universities often served as garrisons helping fortify settlements,
while administrators, faculty, and graduates participated in missionary
efforts and anti-Indian warfare.]{.underline}** Colleges grew by
appropriating Indian land and investing in Southern and Caribbean
plantations. **[Planters, slavers, and the merchants who profited from
slavery served as trustees and were the most important donors in the
early history of universities.]{.underline}** Northern campuses catered
to the white male planter and merchant class for donations and
enrollments. **[The colleges, moreover, were built by]{.underline}**
Indian and Looking at Student Debt \| 275 African **[slave
labor.]{.underline}** **[Owning Indian and African slaves was the norm
for the majority of college presidents and for many faculty and
students, such that college campuses were often sites of white
supremacist violence where slaves were imprisoned, whipped, raped, and
tortured. At the same time, universities were invested in the production
of racist knowledge purporting to demonstrate white superiority and
Black and Indian inferiority.]{.underline}** In all these ways, Wilder's
study suggests that from the colonial era to the mid-nineteenth century,
**[higher education was built on a foundation of settler colonialism and
slavery that continues to serve]{.underline}**, I would argue, **[as
part of the sedimented conditions of possibility for contemporary
universities. A longer genealogy of US universities and settler
colonialism would include the establishment of Native American boarding
schools; the history of racist team mascots and of Indigenous protests
against them; university resistance to demands for the repatriation of
Indigenous remains; the struggles of Indigenous students, intellectuals,
and activists over existing universities and efforts to produce
alternative educational institutions; and finally, of course, the
marginalization and indebtedness of contemporary Indigenous college
students on US campuses.]{.underline}** To return to The Imperial
University, Chatterjee and Maira begin the introduction by
describing---the first from the perspective of her university office in
the United States and the second from Ramallah, Palestine---the
heavyhanded police responses to student protests over a 31 percent
tuition increase in the University of California, including the widely
disseminated images of a campus police officer pepper spraying peaceful
protestors. Which raises the question: **[what is the relationship
between the disciplining of campus dissent by settler colonial
militarism, on the one hand, and the disciplinary force of student debt,
on the other?]{.underline}** In distinct yet not unrelated ways, **[both
student debt and the occupation of Palestinian territories cut to the
heart of articulations of a right to education, or more broadly what
Harney and Moten call "study," a practice of collective thought and
social activity irreducible to and in fact antagonistic to market
logics.]{.underline}** This point was partly suggested by a recent
contribution to American Quarterly by Rana Sharif titled "The Right to
Education: La Frontera to Gaza." Sharif's essay was part of a forum
based on a teach-in at USC organized by David Lloyd and Laura Pulido to
consider "the connections and differences between the struggles of the
Chicana/o and Palestinian peoples." **[Sharif notes that the
"cartography" of the Israeli occupation, with its "fragmentation of land
due to borders, checkpoints, barricades, and the apartheid wall," limits
Palestinian students' access to education.]{.underline}** The wall, for
example, blocks the path of 36 percent of students at Al-Quds University
and prevents about 15,740 students 276 \| American Quarterly from
reaching their schools, while over 90 percent of An-Najah University
students report missing classes because of checkpoint delays.
**[Palestinian students are also often harassed and detained for their
campus organizing efforts]{.underline}**. Finally, Sharif argues **[that
the educational system in the occupied territories often elides
knowledge about Palestinian history and culture: "The systematic denial
by Israel of the histories of the expulsion of Palestinians from their
homes, the fate of the refugees, and the destruction of Palestinian
villages, amounts to an attempt at eradicating any cohesive Palestinian
identity."]{.underline}** **[The material obliteration of Palestine is
thus complemented by its ideological erasure in
education]{.underline}**. Sharif draws on the work of Birzeit
University's "Right to Education Campaign," and the story titles on
their website provide a concise taxonomy of how the occupation blocks
Palestinian education: "Students in Detention"; "Closure of Educational
Institutions"; "The Wall's Impact on Education"; and "Incursions and
Attacks" on Palestinian schools and universities. Their website also
reports on how **[the Israeli blockade of Gaza has financially
devastated both universities and students, who have increasingly gone
into debt.]{.underline}** Finally, Birzeit's website features notices of
boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) endorsements from
non-Palestinian student groups focused on the abolition of student debt.
**[The student-led BDS movement on college campuses could thus also be
described as part of a broader effort to take some control over the
student debt financing of settler colonial violence.]{.underline}**

that **[Saudi Arabia has become increasingly violent and unpredictable
under Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who was appointed in 2017.
Direct military support has empowered Saudi leaders to lash out
recklessly without meaningful accountability, leading thousands of
Yemenis, Bahrainis, Syrians and even Saudi citizens to starve and die in
attacks]{.underline}**. American arm sales embolden Saudi hawks to
continue their hardcore military approaches. Since 2011, Saudi Arabia
has intervened in the affairs of states like Tunisia, Syria and Qatar.
**[Weapons produced and provided by the US have facilitated the deaths
of innocent civilians in Yemen]{.underline}**. US bombs produced by
Lockheed Martin killed forty children on a school bus in August 2018. A
similar strike killed 155 people in a funeral hall, and 97 people were
killed at a Yemeni market by a bomb from the United States. **[While US
arm sales are not the sole cause of the geopolitical and humanitarian
crisis in Yemen, arms sales certainly enable conflicts to persist and
proliferate]{.underline}**: recipients of major conventional weapons are
70 percent more likely to engage in conflict than non-recipients. **[The
United States has an antecedent role in Yemen's current situation
through its Saudi arms sales and can take steps towards alleviating
Yemenis' suffering.]{.underline}** Ending US arms sales to Saudi Arabia
will help resolve the conflict in Yemen in two ways. First, US arms
often end up in the wrong hands, sometimes intentionally and sometimes
unintentionally. Nima Elbagir of CNN reports that Saudi Arabia has been
transferring American weapons to Salafi militias and other factions to
escalate the conflict. These groups cannot adequately retain the weapons
that they receive. For example, Houthi and Iranian-backed forces have
also wielded US weapons in Yemen. The Houthis are currently more
militarily sophisticated and better able to strike beyond Yemen's
borders than they were at the start of the war. Ending arms sales will
disarm groups on both sides and help stop large quantities of weapons
from stoking the flames of conflict. Second, ending arms sales will
ground Saudi Arabia's airstrikes. Other than proxy groups, Saudi
Arabia's main method to wage war and perpetrate genocide is by deploying
its US-fueled air force.**[The United States continually refuels the
coalition aircraft that is used to kill a large number of civilians in
coalition airstrikes; US-made munitions have been found at numerous
attack sites, ranging from hospitals to weddings]{.underline}**. In
Yemen alone, over half of civilian deaths have been caused by Saudi
airstrikes that targeted hospitals, funerals, schools and refugee camps.
The Saudis have blockaded food and supplies from entering Yemen in
coordination with the United States as well. Ending arms sales will
limit Saudi Arabia's capability to incite violence abroad and stifle
civilian populations' wellbeings. Moreover, Saudi Arabia's military
technology is maintained and upgraded by the United States with almost
no assistance from the Saudis. **[Shifting maintenance costs to Saudi
Arabia will help check Saudi aggression.]{.underline}**

### Arm Sales Link Turn -- Middle East

#### The aff directly opposes a huge facet of capitalism -- disarmament is a means of reducing the West's control of modes of production in the Middle East

yet the conversation has not generally moved toward the idea that the
**[Saudi Arabian invasion of Yemen may be a pretext for Saudi Arabia to
seize Yemen, occupy it, and most importantly, control its oil reserves
and production. Given the moves that Saudi Arabia has been making
internationally, this perspective should be heavily considered. Saudi
Arabia, with US influence, is seeking to make what can be described as
an international oil conglomerate. Another indicator of the
westernization of Saudi Arabia has been the relatively recent inclusion
of Israel in the budding Saudi-US oil conglomerate]{.underline}**. By
changing its stance toward Israel officially, **[Saudi Arabia is
shifting]{.underline}** the balance of Middle Eastern socio-religious
power away from Wahabbist Islamism, and inexorably **[toward the West,
and perhaps in the future, toward capitalism. What do these three
nations, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and now Israel all have in
common? The mutual goal of destroying Iran]{.underline}**. A second
reason for the Saudi invasion of Yemen and likely also part of the
explanation is that Yemen appears to be supported and backed by Iran,
and Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a larger regional Cold War. The
US wants Iran gone to eliminate the possibility of a nuclear arms race
in the Middle East, as a power hostile to the West having bombs is not
something the US wants. In fact, the only Middle Eastern power which the
US is interested in seeing have nuclear arms is Israel. The idea of
Saudi Arabia having nukes is not "really" on the table for them right
now, and in some ways Saudi Arabia is uninterested in nuclear weapons
given to them by the US. If one assumes that states and their leaders
are rational actors, and that leaders make decisions in rational
self-interest, **[the US is interested in controlling the access that
Middle Eastern states have to nukes, in order to have some control, and
thus political and economic influence over Middle Eastern states'
ability to make war]{.underline}**. But Saudi Arabia does not refuse
American nuclear weapon technology out of ambivalence or virtue, but
rather that Saudi Arabia does not want to be beholden to American
nuclear disarmament regulations as a prerequisite for trade and aid,
something to note, that the US violates in order to aid Israel. If Saudi
Arabia wants the bomb, they will likely not get it with the help of the
US, and may seek to gain it illicitly like Iran, ironically. Saudi
Arabia likely wants the bomb in order to cement their power as the
dominant Middle Eastern force, but they do not want the bomb on the US'
terms. But the bomb may still be a long way off for Saudi Arabia. The
raw nuclear material in Saudi power plants is anywhere between 3--10%
enrichment, not enough for a bomb. Uranium must be enriched to nearly
100% in order to be viable to put into a 4-stage ICBM. Israel's goal in
seeing Iran destroyed is simple. Beyond pure survival, Israel does echo
most of the decisions and rhetoric put forth by the US. Experts suspect
that in a way, Israel is the tip of the American spear in the Middle
East. **[The United States is playing a long chess game of eventually
having complete military control of all of the oil resources in the
Middle East, to ensure its national security future. The US is currently
the world's largest consumer of petroleum products and has been for
decades, with estimates nearing 19 million barrels of oil consumed by
the US per day, with China in second place at around 10.4 billion
barrels a day]{.underline}**. Other than Israel gaining a piece of that
pie, Iran being removed from the board is Israel's goal, arguing pure
survival. The continuation of war in the Middle East is vital to both US
and Israeli policy, as the richer the US is, the more military funding
and other aid Israel gains, irrespective of whether or not this aid is
violative of international aid regulations, which require unilateral
nuclear disarmament. Many experts say that US aid to Israel is illegal,
but nevertheless it continues. Finally, Saudi Arabia's goal to conquer
Iran is perhaps threefold. One, Saudi Arabia is angry at the Iranians
for not playing ball with this westernized oil conglomerate being
established, and the Saudi sentiment toward Qatar is the same.
Al-Jazeera, a prominent international news group funded by Qatar, is
being censored and strong armed by Saudi Arabia in order to force Qatar
to fall in line. Qatar has been making moves to get closer to Iran, and
away from both Saudi Arabia and the US. Two, **[because of all of the
American cash flowing into the country, billions per year, the more oil
Saudi Arabia can control, the more they can sell to America. The more
oil that Saudi Arabia can sell, the richer they can become, and the more
funding Saudi Arabia can put into its own military, currently spending
around \$60 billion annually. To put Saudi Arabia's military into
perspective, they are around the top 5 military spenders
currently,]{.underline}** next to England, China, Russia, and of course
the US, whose military spending is near \$700 billion annually. Third,
Saudi Arabia may appear to be on board with America's long-term goal of
destabilizing Iran to remove them as an ally of Russia, which has been
showing support to Iran in what some have called a New Cold War.

#### The US is the largest arms sales proliferator in the Middle East. Reducing arms sales to Saudi Arabia prevents the use of arms to accumulate surplus capital in the US

Us\";

It's one of those stories of the century that somehow never gets treated
that way. For an astounding 25 of the past 26 years, the United States
has been the leading arms dealer on the planet, at some moments in near
monopolistic fashion. Its major weapons-producers, including Boeing,
Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin, regularly pour the latest in high-tech
arms and munitions into the most explosive areas of the planet with
ample assistance from the Pentagon. In recent years, the bulk of those
arms have gone to the Greater Middle East. Donald Trump is only the
latest American president to preside over a global arms sales bonanza.
With remarkable enthusiasm, he's appointed himself America's number one
weapons salesman and he couldn't be prouder of the job he's doing.
Earlier this month, for instance, on the very day Congress was debating
whether to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen,
**[Trump engaged in one of his favorite presidential activities:
bragging about the economic benefits of the American arms sales he's
been promoting. He was joined in his moment of braggadocio by Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the chief architect of that war. That
grim conflict has killed thousands of civilians through indiscriminate
air strikes, while putting millions at risk of death from famine,
cholera, and other "natural" disasters caused at least in part by a
Saudi-led blockade of that country's ports]{.underline}**. That
Washington-enabled humanitarian crisis provided the backdrop for the
Senate's consideration of a bill co-sponsored by Vermont independent
Senator Bernie Sanders, Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee, and
Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. It was aimed at ending U.S.
mid-air refueling of Saudi war planes and Washington's additional
assistance for the Saudi war effort (at least until the war is
explicitly authorized by Congress). The bill generated a vigorous
debate. In the end, on an issue that wouldn't have even come to the
floor two years ago, an unprecedented 44 senators voted to halt this
country's support for the Saudi war effort. The bill nonetheless went
down to defeat and the suffering in Yemen continues. **[Debate about the
merits of that brutal war was, however, the last thing on the mind of a
president who views his bear-hug embrace of the Saudi regime as a
straightforward business proposition. He's so enthusiastic about selling
arms to Riyadh that he even brought his very own prop to the White House
meeting with bin Salman: a U.S. map highlighting which of the 50 states
would benefit most from pending weapons sales to the prince's
country]{.underline}**. You undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that
Michigan, Ohio, and Florida, the three crucial swing states in the 2016
presidential election, were specially highlighted. His latest stunt only
underscored a simple fact of his presidency: **[Trump's arms sales are
meant to promote pork-barrel politics, while pumping up the profits of
U.S. weapons manufacturers]{.underline}**. As for human rights or human
lives, who cares? To be fair, Donald Trump is hardly the first American
president to make it his business to aggressively promote weapons
exports. Though seldom a highlighted part of his presidency, Barack
Obama proved to be a weapons salesman par excellence. He made more arms
offers in his two terms in office than any U.S. president since World
War II, including an astounding \$115 billion in weapons deals with
Saudi Arabia. For the tiny group of us who follow such things, that map
of Trump's only underscored a familiar reality. **[On it, in addition to
the map linking U.S. jobs and arms transfers to the Saudis, were little
boxes that highlighted four specific weapons sales worth tens of
billions of dollars. Three of those that included the THAAD missile
defense system, C-130 transport planes, P-8 anti-submarine warfare
planes, and Bradley armored vehicles were, in fact, completed during the
Obama years]{.underline}**. So much for Donald Trump's claim to be a
deal maker the likes of which we've never seen before. You might, in
fact, say that the truest arms race these days is between American
presidents, not the United States and other countries. **[Not only has
the U.S. been the world's top arms exporting nation throughout this
century, but last year it sold one and a half times as much weaponry as
its closest rival, Russia.]{.underline}**

### Link Turn - Demilitarization

#### US arms sales to Saudi Arabia rely on economic motivations -- demilitarization would remove an intermediate facilitator of the capitalist system

Of the six factors that will help divine whether to expect a continued
decline in African arms imports, the end of the Cold War has already
been discussed at some length. It is indeed key because **[most African
states lack the domestic capacity to produce their own conventional
arms]{.underline}** (with the exception of South Africa, though the
impact of sanctions demonstrated the white regime\'s vulnerability in
this regard). **[African states exist in a precarious dependency
relationship with their Western suppliers. To the extent that the end of
the Cold War has removed the ideological and strategic justification for
outside powers to supply African clients, one could logically assume
that they would reduce their arms sales to the region. The decline we
have seen so far seems to bear out this conclusion. Arms sales, however,
can also be economically motivated. Though the end of the Cold War has
made ideological struggle seemingly irrelevant, economic competition in
the new world order has only been intensified.]{.underline}** Even
before the Cold War ended, the threat had been growing that Third World
powers such as Brazil, North Korea, China and Egypt would seek to profit
from arms sales, and that **[Saudi Arabia, Libya and a less-scrutinized
Iraq might also play the role of intermediaries for arms sales to
sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline}**. The Western powers are already
seeking to ensure that the republics of the former Soviet Union will not
be able to sell nuclear weapons to Third World countries. Within the
African continent, only Libya, and possibly the Republic of South
Africa, would seem to be potential customers for nuclear technology or
weapons. But conventional weapons have a far wider market in Africa.
Will the former Soviet republics (or former satellites such as
Czechoslovakia) resume arms sales to Africa, which the Soviet Union had
decided to terminate? The possibility certainly exists that the Soviet
Union\'s collapse could negate the other gains wrought by the end of the
Cold War, though it is too early at this point to be sure. In any case,
the behavior of these new republics must be taken into account when
analyzing the post-Cold War order.
