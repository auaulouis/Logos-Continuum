As Africana studies became institutionalized, [the need for surveillance
abated as its primary objective became transformed into multicultural
recognition and its focus became organized around cultural
specification]{.underline}. "[[This severance of race from
rights]{.underline}]{.mark} across a broad sociopolitical spectrum...
**[[made it possible for multiculturalism... to simply represent
politics of cultural recognition without recognition of equal social
reward or redistributive justice]{.underline}]{.mark}**."172 Stated
differently, redistribution became extricated from cultural recognition
in demands for selfdetermination.173 The [[emphasis on abstract
representation ultimately allowed the academy, the state, and capital to
shore up their power]{.underline},]{.mark}174 because "[the margins" and
the "periphery" came to be understood as sites of cultural empowerment
and contestation]{.underline}. Within culture, marginality, though it
remains peripheral to the broader mainstream, has never been such a
productive space as it is now. And that is not simply the opening within
the dominant spaces that those outside it can occupy. It is also the
result of the cultural politics of difference, of the struggle around
difference, of the production of new identities, of the appearance of
new subjects on the political and cultural scene... What we are talking
about is a [struggle over cultural hegemony... [Cultural hegemony is
never about pure victory or pure domination]{.mark}]{.underline}... it
is [always about shifting the balance of power in relations of
culture]{.underline}; it is always about [[changing the dispositions and
the configurations of cultural power, not getting out of
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}175 The goal was to "develop cultural strategies
that make a difference."176 In area studies, **[strategic
marginal/[peripheral countries became productive spaces for the
conjoining of state and academy because they represented areas in which
the United States could extend its influence, management, and
regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In a similar fashion, [the struggle
by subjects for "new identities" in contestations over cultural hegemony
became central to the success of efforts of reinscription into U.S.
state, capital, and empire.]{.underline} In other words, the
accommodation of difference by the state, first though area studies,
then through ethnic studies/Africana studies, allowed the U.S. state to
acquire knowledge so that it could adequately inscribe those occupying
the margins into its imperial project. In the final analysis, [[academic
research and scholarship produced knowledge of "others from without" and
"others from within" to be employed by state and
capital]{.underline}]{.mark} while conscripting them to their agendas
[through the deployment of technologies of cultural
relativism]{.underline}. The **[[margin/periphery became an important
frontier for U.S. imperial expansion abroad and U.S conscription of the
racialized other]{.underline}]{.mark}** at home and abroad. With the
focus on difference and cultural politics, the margins came to be
incorporated into the "center" in the core; and the periphery came to be
incorporated into the core of global capital, while each maintained
their marginal positions. As the site of struggle shifted to the meaning
of difference and to demands for representation and recognition of
cultural identities in society, the focus of Africana studies
necessarily shifted to the politicization of culture, to the development
of new identities, and to contesting the cultural hegemony of the
"mainstream." With domination culturally specified, [demands for change
in and reconfiguration of relations of power came to rest on efforts
aimed at the deployment of a politics of difference that would place
Blackness on an equal footing with white cultural forms]{.underline}.
[The state was able to]{.underline} 175 [accommodate these demands by
shifting to a more open, inclusive, and accommodating "disposition of
power]{.underline}"177 [**[that was effective without compromising its
capitalist and imperialist agenda.]{.underline}** **[While increasingly
worse off in material terms because of the shift to neoliberalism, Black
people came to be recognized and represented in popular culture and
popular discourse, where they could be adequately policed, regulated,
and commodified]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As Hall acknowledges, the spaces
"won" for difference can become spectacularized and morphed into
segregated visibility. Through collaboration between the state and the
academy cultural identity politics came to be recognized as the only
acceptable articulation of Black struggle and contestation. The radical
transformative potential of "wars of position" became foreclosed by
culturalist specifications, unhinged from critical political economy
critique, and organized around struggles for a place in global
capitalist formation.178 American studies provided the grammar for the
conflation of Africana studies with the interdisciplinary study of
culture. Fletcher asserts, "...black studies in the sixties... focused
on the national or 'ethnic' feature of the African American freedom
struggle. Culture was prominent, but so too was a nonclass view of
African American experience."179 The cultural specifications of
Blackness readily accommodated the transition to African diaspora
studies as the 1980s and 1990s inaugurated concerns about globalization
and transnationalism. Additionally, African diaspora studies reinscribed
Culturalism in two ways. First, it inserted alternative discourses of
Blackness into an existing cultural framework that was legible to and
useful for the state. If it is true that "\[t\]he multicultural... meets
its limits where it becomes foreign, and 'foreign' signifies
'anti-American,'" then the African diaspora was a method of engaging
"foreign" notions of Blackness---those with different histories,
developments, and relationships to the state---without challenging the
pedagogy of the U.S. state. By doing so it avoided the problem of being
marked and targeted as 'anti-American.' In fact, by the 1980s, "the U.S.
government no longer seriously consider\[ed\] black Americans to be a
potential Soviet Trojan Horse or a possible Communist fifth column...
The massive changes resulting from the success of the civil rights
movement ha\[d\] virtually eliminated the appeal of the international
Communist movement as a useful weapon to African-Americans."180 Second,
Culturalism created the conditions for African diaspora studies to
further distance itself from the (Black) left because, "\[a\]t a certain
level, [the Left]{.underline}, through its critique of empire,
intersects with the foreign in being cast as unnational."181 It
[deterritorialized, relativized, and abstracted Blackness in a way that
seriously hampered a structural critique of power]{.underline}.
**[[Blackness was delinked from the nationstate and its historical
specificity and asserted as a hybrid, transcultural phenomenon, so the
location-specific materialities of dispossession and domination that
produced and reinscribed the Black went largely
uncontested]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [shift to African diaspora
studies]{.underline} was a way to move the study of Blackness beyond the
nation-state and the specificities of race, and [to articulate it as a
cultural phenomenon to keep it under the radar of state
surveillance.]{.underline} Robert L. Harris, Jr. defines Africana
studies as: \[T\]he multidisciplinary analysis of the lives and thought
of people of African ancestry on the African continent and throughout
the world. It embraces Africa, Afro-America, and the Caribbean, but does
not confine itself to those three geographical areas. Africana studies
examines people of African ancestry wherever they may be found... Its
primary means of organization are racial and cultural..."182 As a
corrective, descriptive, and prescriptive project---in that
order---Africana Studies became a means to combat white racial and
cultural supremacy. 183 Once it became a field of study in the academy,
culture overdetermined the methods by which the African diaspora could
"confront the legacies" of racialized domination. This slippage between
Blackness and 176 culture can be explained by the ways in which American
studies and area studies laid the institutional groundwork for Africana
studies, and later, African diaspora studies. Schueller writes, "The
[twin imperatives of color-blind illusion and American global power have
coalesced into... multicultural imperialism that seeks to regulate
public discourse.]{.underline} Within this regulatory mechanism,
radical, race-based multiculturalism, and critiques of imperialism, both
[le**[gacies of civil rights and decolonization movements are deemed
national security threats.]{.underline}**]{.mark}"184 The
"colorblindness" of the diaspora analytic asserts itself from an
articulation of structural power relations in cultural terms. This
understanding became inhered in a regulated public discourse in which
Blackness came to take on so many forms, variations, articulations, and
enunciations that it became all but impossible to contest the
materialities of power.185 According to Robin Kelley: "Whether we employ
metaphors of survival, retention, exchange, transformation,
acculturation, or conversation, the remaking of African New World
cultures had enormous implications not just for the study of the African
diaspora but for the Atlantic as a whole." 186 Such a remaking of
"**[[the African diaspora" as a cultural space served to marginalize
material analyses of the effects of forced labor, racialization,
dispossession, coloniality, and capitalist exploitation that manifest
across the modern world-system in ways that are coordinated but not
fixed or uniform, and that always require the unequal or unfree labor of
Black people.]{.underline}]{.mark}**187 The [culturalist
orientation]{.underline} of Africana studies and diaspora theory in the
academy [foreclosed critical engagement with political
economy]{.underline}. As international linkages became culturally
specified and divorced from political and economic realities, it
**[[foreclosed possibilities offered up by variations of socialism and
Communism, that "reache\[d\] out to all oppressed colonial subjects...
\[and\] enabled many different people to identify with other oppressed
peoples and to reject patriotism and national
identity]{.underline}]{.mark}**."188 [Race became essentialized in
globalized relations of representation]{.underline}.189 The
[possibilities of international alliances against capitalist oppression
were also foreclosed in academic formulations of the African diaspora
because "the Atlantic" as a unit of analysis]{.underline}190 [became
frequently articulated to explain and make assertions about "political
and cultural autonomy of African people in the West.]{.underline}"191
African diaspora theory became used largely [as a means of interrogating
how the "transatlantic system]{.underline}" influenced representations
of Africa and impacted the formation of "African" identity, and how "the
cultures, ideas, \[and\] epistemologies taken from Africa or created in
the 'New World' have deeply influenced art, religion, politics,
philosophy, and social relations in the West."192 As a result,
"Africanness" came to be understood as a culturalized form of
transnational Blackness that had no historical, geospatial, political,
or economic specificity. This [negated the possibility for structural or
material critique. Converted into a transhistorical receptacle of
culture and survival, opportunities for the consideration of "Africa" as
a contemporary reality tend to be severely curtailed]{.underline}. As
Harris explains, Black college students during the "Civil Rights
revolution" demanded the inclusion of African studies in newly-formed
Africana studies departments out of the belief that the image of Africa
impacted the status of African Americans; that [African heritage
informed the cultural heritage of African Americans; and that "true"
representations of the history, politics, and culture of Africa could
act to counteract the Eurocentrism and Western cultural exclusivity
prevalent in U.S. institutions of higher education]{.underline}.193
Resentment was directed against the failure to acknowledge the "African
heritage" of these black students, thus reducing them merely to the
descendants of slaves.194 In other words, they were largely motivated by
cultural concerns.

**Capitalism is the proximate and root cause of racial violence. Race is
a tool of capital -- orients white workers against others through racial
categorization which prevents solidarity**

On my reading, the figures in the left column tend toward the more
conventional view that [[racism, race, and antiblackness are, in the
last analysis, capitalist ideologies and practices.]{.mark}]{.underline}
They are [[tools of labor exploitation and management: capitalists
undermine working-class solidarity by splitting workers along racial
lines]{.underline}]{.mark}; they [convince white workers that whiteness
rather than class solidarity is the true guardian of their
interests]{.underline}. [Employing]{.mark} the tool of a [[racially
stratified labor market,]{.underline} [capitalists
convince]{.underline}]{.mark} white workers, including the petit
bourgeoisie19 (shopkeepers, police officers, firefighters, lower-level
clerical workers, and others striving to become members of the upper
middle class, that is, the very people who constitute the bedrock of
President Trump's support20[), [that any economic and status gains black
workers make comes at their expense.]{.underline}]{.mark} In a
competitive labor market, which reduces workers across racial lines to
the same status[, the metaphysics of whiteness is the only thing that
stands between white workers and black workers in a society where honor
and dishonor are racially coded]{.underline}. DuBois called this
[ideology of honor and dishonor]{.underline}, this zero-sum racial
logic, [the "wages of whiteness]{.underline}." These wages are
compensatory and psychological; [[the wages that white workers receive
by identifying their interests in terms of racial membership rather than
class solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Their [bosses may exploit them
through low wages and meager benefits. **But at least they are not
black**]{.underline}.]{.mark} White elites in Hollywood and the culture
industries may trash their image. But at least they are not black. Upper
and middle class whites may call them "white trash." But at least they
are not black (this affirmation or denial notwithstanding, the fear of
"falling" into blackness, of racialization, which the slur "white trash"
signals, is intense).

(#Alt-Woke Manifesto is the work of ANON. We are a collective of

If the liberal is the evangelical, pearl clutching apostle of the woke
Left, the radical, then, is St. Augustine --- the hierophant, the
pedagogue. [[The radical is the vanguard inhabiting academia]{.mark} &
activism, creating the language and atmosphere of critique.]{.underline}
[I[ts ideologies trickle down from intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark}
[at universities [to moderate liberals]{.mark}]{.underline} on social
media, [[and]{.mark} more recently, [the Alt-Right (e.g. culture
jamming]{.mark} by way of "meme magic" [or the synthesis of identity
politics and white nationalism]{.mark} by way of identitarianism).
[Radicals scapegoated liberals to absolve themselves of]{.mark} any
[responsibility by being all critique with no tangible
answers.]{.mark}]{.underline} The radical left in its current
incarnation is somewhat fossilized in terms of strategies and needs an
immediate remodelling. [The radical is too comfortable inhabiting only
the periphery of academia & activism. Radical academics and activists
are insulated not only by algorithms but also their obsolescence. [The
radical academic has failed to bridge the gap between intellectuals &
larger society.]{.mark}]{.underline} That is, [**[intellectuals failed
to subvert hegemony and normativity.]{.underline}** [Academics did not
do enough to reach beyond universities and make positive
reforms]{.underline}]{.mark} to public education. [[Intellectuals failed
to politicize the natural sciences]{.underline}]{.mark} early enough.
[[Intellectuals lost programming]{.mark} and hacker culture [to
neoliberalism]{.mark} & libertarians. [Computer science transitioned
from cyberpunk to Silicon Valley]{.mark} venture capitalism. Had radical
academics succeeded, there might've been more legitimacy in the
fight]{.underline} to combat climate change. Or traditional journalism
wouldn't have been so easily defeated by the post-fact information
economy. What we have now is a new Scholasticism of students &
professors as clergy dominated by an agitated, anti-intellectual
populist bloc. "Learning surrenders control to the future, threatening
established power. It is vigorously suppressed by all political
structures, which replace it with a docilizing and conformist education,
reproducing privilege as wisdom. Schools are social devices whose
specific function is to incapacitate learning, and universities are
employed to legitimate schooling through perpetual reconstitution of
global social memory. The meltdown of metropolitan education systems in
the near future is accompanied by a quasi-punctual bottom-up takeover of
academic institutions, precipitating their mutation into amnesiac
cataspace-exploration zones and bases manufacturing cyberian
soft-weaponry." Nick Land, "Meltdown" (1994) The radical activist lost
its sense resistance. There are no radicals in Congress. There are no
radical lawmakers. No radical judges. [[Community organizing is helpful,
but it's not sufficient.]{.mark} To remain relevant radicals have to
widen their scope to adapt to the changing global climate.]{.underline}
"The idea that one organisation, tactic or strategy applies equally well
to any sort of struggle is one of the most pervasive and damaging
beliefs among today's left. Strategic reflection -- on means and ends,
enemies and allies -- is necessary before approaching any political
project. Given the nature of global capitalism, [[any postcapitalist
project will require an ambitious, abstract]{.mark}, mediated, complex
and [global approach]{.mark} -- one that folk-political approaches are
incapable of providing.]{.underline}" --- Nick Srnicek and Alex
Williams, "Inventing the Future" (2015)

[[There is no]{.mark} zone of complete [neutrality]{.mark} in a world of
role performances]{.underline}. [Obedient performances in cumulative
effect tend to support the existing regime as they insinuate its
dictates into our collective habits of perception, judgment, and
action]{.underline}. **[Unless a dissident group of workers meticulously
"works according to rule" to disrupt production through excruciating
obedience in a way that discloses how tangled formal rules can
become]{.underline}**. Or a group creatively improvises on the
performance of Bartleby the Scrivener, posing endless questions about
the orders given to it until the machine overflows itself or is jammed.
**[[These indeed are creative role
experimentations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [So was the practice in Eastern
Europe during the late stages of Soviet rule to clap endlessly when a
Soviet stooge spoke]{.underline}, [until the bewildered speaker was
moved to sit down amid the roar around him]{.underline}. [I recently
attended a faculty meeting with the president of my university at which
the entire faculty remained silent after his Ceo-style talk ended and he
departed slowly up the aisle. **Sometimes silence sends a message to
power.** **Our lives are messages**]{.underline}.5 [**[Role
experimentation can disrupt and redirect the flow of authority, habit,
institutional regularity, and future projection]{.underline}**. **[It
can also encourage others to look more closely at their own
performances]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in this or that
domain]{.underline}**. **[[Such experiments]{.mark} can also [set the
stage for]{.mark} more adventurous and [larger scale
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. My examples will be limited to con-
stituencies who are the most apt to read this book, though they could
easily be adjusted to a broader array. **[[Suppose a constellation of
students]{.mark}, studying to enter professional life, forms study
groups to explore more closely how those professions presuppose and
[enforce]{.mark} a set of [practices that contribute to the fragility of
things as they simultaneously draw attention away from that
contributio]{.mark}n]{.underline}**. [The students may pose **untimely
questions** in their political science]{.underline}, [economics,
engineering, medical, business, legal, and biology classes]{.underline}.
[If in a secular institution, they may seek out courses that complicate
the assumptions of secularism. If in a religious school, they may
organize a group to explore the history of atheism or of minority faiths
that eschew the theme of a per- sonal God]{.underline}. **[[They can
engage experimental artistic work]{.mark} that stretches their habitual
patterns of perception and judgment]{.underline}**. The nature- and
soundscape compositions of John Luther Adams have salutary effects on
many in this respect. **[Such [activities can also prime you to
experiment with other role performances]{.mark} once you enter
professional life]{.underline}**. **[If a lawyer, you may organize to
rethink your connections to the ugly prison system and to adjust your
practice to protest its ugliness]{.underline}**. Or **[you may give a
portion of your time to challenge corporations, localities, and states
that defile the environment]{.underline}**. [If a doctor, you may
organize voluntary medical care for the poor and publicize what you are
doing]{.underline}. In both cases **[these experimentations make a
modest difference on their own, prime our capacities for more sensitive
perception in other domains of life, and may prepare us to participate
with others in yet more adventurous activities]{.underline}**. **[These
are minor moments, but [an accumulation of minor moments]{.mark} can
[jostle]{.mark} settled [habits of perception]{.mark}; they can
encourage a readiness to become more exploratory; and they can extend
the time horizon within which we think and act]{.underline}**.
[Suppose]{.underline}, now, [you are middle- or upper-middle-class
citizens in a polity that has competitive elections]{.underline}. [You
have become increasingly dissatisfied with the course your society is
taking. **Voting**]{.underline}, while pertinent, **[seems radically
insufficient]{.underline}** to the issues involved. Its time horizon is
too short and the strategic place of ill-informed undecided voters in
electoral politics skews campaigns too sharply. [Inequality has been
extended]{.underline}. The [lower reaches of society are left out in the
cold and often blamed for the suffering they undergo. The news media are
organized around scandal and a brief time horizon]{.underline}.
**[[Racial differences are exploited to break up potential
coalitions]{.mark} on the left.]{.underline}** [A large slice of the
population is periodically suscep- tible to war fever. [Climate change
is widely subjected to deferral, denial, or formal acceptance
disconnected from action]{.mark}. And the right wing actively promotes
filibusters and legislative stalemates to encourage more and more people
to withdraw from citizenship and to tolerate the privatization of more
and more of life.]{.underline} The sciences and professions with which
you are familiar are often too narrowly defined. Too many churches
either provide refuges from the world or serve as sites of aggressive
attack on ecological concerns, homosexu- ality, carriers of alternative
faiths, or poor minorities. You know what po- litical party you support;
[you vote regularly; and you give time and money to your party. But you
also find it difficult to connect the sentiments you profess to the role
expectations sedimented into your practices of work, church,
consumption, neighborhood association, investment portfolio, children's
school, artistic pursuits, and local news reporting. **[Now is the time
to join others]{.mark} in becoming role experimentalists.** You may
actively support the **farm-to-table movement** in the restaurants you
visit]{.underline}; you may support **[the slow food
movement]{.underline}**; you may [frequent stores that offer food based
on sustainable processes]{.underline}; you may **[buy a hybrid or, if
feasible, join an urban zip-car collective]{.underline}**, explaining to
friends, family, and neighbors what effect [such choices could have on
late modern ecology if a majority of the populace did one or the
other]{.underline}; you may press your neighborhood association and
workplace to buy solar panels and install them yourself; **[you may use
writing and media skills developed in school to write for a
blog]{.underline}**; **[you may shift a large portion of your retirement
account into investments that support sustainable energy]{.underline}**;
you may withdraw from aggressive investments that presuppose an
unsustainable growth pattern, threaten economic collapse, and/or
undermine the collec- tive future; you may bring new issues and visitors
to your church, temple, or mosque to support rethinking about
interdenominational issues and the contemporary fragility of things; you
may found, join, or frequent a repair club, at which volunteers collect
and repair old appliances, furni- ture, and vehicles to cut back on
urban waste and increase the longevity of these items; [you may probe
and publicize the multimodal tactics by which twenty-four-hour news
stations work on the visceral register of their viewers, as you explore
ways to counter those techniques]{.underline}; you may travel to places
where unconscious American assumptions about world entitlement are
challenged on a regular basis; you may augment your pattern of films and
artistic exhibits attended to stretch your habitual powers of perception
and to challenge some affect-imbued prejudgments embedded in them; [you
may seek out new friends who are also moving in these directions. You
may regularly relay pregnant essays you encounter to friends,
colleagues, and relatives. **[A series of minor role
experiments]{.mark}.** As we proceed our aspirational selves may now
begin to exceed our operational selves, and the shame we feel about the
discrepancy between these two aspects of the self may
**[generate]{.mark} energy to enter into yet [new modes]{.mark} of role
experimentation**]{.underline}.6 [We]{.underline} thus [begin to make
ourselves and our engagements **more experimental** rather than simply
falling into a ready- made set of role expectations]{.underline}. We
have begun to become what Nietzsche calls "our own guinea pigs" rather
than merely being the guinea pigs of those in charge of these
institutions. [As such experiments accumulate, the ice in and around us
begins to crack]{.underline}. First, [the **[shaky perceptions,
feelings, and beliefs]{.mark}** with which we started these
experimentations now become more refined and more
entrenched]{.underline}. Second, **[we [are]{.mark} now [better situated
to forge connections]{.mark} with yet larger constituencies engaging in
similar experiments]{.underline}**. Third, [as these connections
accumulate we may be more inspired to join macropolitical movements that
speak to the issues]{.underline}. Fourth, **[as we now join protests,
slowdowns, and confrontational meetings with corporate managers, church
leaders, union officials, university officials, and neighborhood
leaders, we may now become more alert to the institutional pressures
that propel these constituencies forward too]{.underline}**. They are
also both enmeshed in a web of roles that en- able and constrain them
and often more than mere role bearers. These roles too exhibit varying
degrees of pressure and slack as they link the details of daily conduct
to the strategic practices of the larger political economy. [[One
advantage of role experimentation]{.mark} by several constituencies at
multiple sites [is that it speaks to a time in which **the drive
to**]{.mark} **significant [change must]{.mark} today [be mobilized by a
large, pluralist assemblage rather than by a single class]{.mark} or
other core constituency**]{.underline}. [Such an assemblage must be
primed and loaded by several constituencies at many sites. **Role
experimentations and the shape of a pluralist assemblage thus inflect
one another.**]{.underline} We must condense some of the steps involved.
But [perhaps **the multidimensional pluralist assemblage** in which you
have now **begun to participate** approaches a **tipping
point**---crystallized, say, by movement back and forth between role
experiments, shifts in the priorities of some strategic in- stitutions,
and a change in the contours of electoral politics]{.underline}. Now [a
surprising event may occur, allowing these emergent energies to be
crystallized]{.underline}. At this point **[some will enter the scene to
say that no kind of "reformism," no matter how extensive, is
acceptable]{.underline}**. **[We must wait for a bigger, more total
transformation, they will say]{.underline}**. **[Such an account will be
offered at precisely this tipping point as the only sophisticated
reading of the world]{.underline}**. **[But it is not]{.underline}**.
Yes, **[roles, institutions, events, constitutive acts, and larger
structures are interinvolved, with each enabling and limiting
others]{.underline}**. Yes, [we do inhabit a world of multiple
entanglements and interconnections]{.underline}. Yes, [[the primacy of
capitalist markets and private ownership does give owners]{.mark} and
high-rolling investors [key advantages]{.mark} in setting the agenda of
the state]{.underline}. [Yes, states subject to public elections are
also limited by systemic relations to corporate structures and the
threat of capital strikes]{.underline}. **[Yes, [extreme inequality,
combined with legislative and court decisions inspired by neo- liberal
ideology]{.mark}, do disenfranchise many as they [release billions of
dollars to right-wing electoral campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yes,
private ownership of the media does give great advantages to the
corporate establishment. Yes, dependent workers do face uphill battles
in limiting capital through labor organiza- tion. Yes, the limited reach
of semisovereign states in the global economy exerts corporate pressure
on them, just as, inside the United States at least, the right-wing
Supreme Court's devolution of authority to states in a fed- eral system
forces states to compete with each other for corporate favors. [Yes,
[elected representatives are dependent on campaign money]{.mark} and
their desires to find jobs as lobbyists after they leave
office]{.underline}. Yes, [there are pressures on many in the lower
middle class to identify with the vision of the future publicized by
those above them]{.underline}. **[It may therefore appear that there are
no cracks and fissures in these interconnected processes]{.underline}**.
**[It [may seem that you must either embrace the system]{.mark} with
fervor, [withdraw]{.mark} as much as possible from it, [or wait]{.mark}
for an explosion that changes everything rapidly. The hegemony of
[neoliberal ideology reinforces such a reading]{.mark} of the
alternatives, in its way, even as it otherwise emphasizes our inability
to have a bird's-eye view of the system]{.underline}**. It offers a
bird's-eye view of the whole whenever it insists that market
self-organization means impersonal market rationality. But repeated
experience belies such an equation. **[[There are numerous examples of
surprising economic meltdowns]{.mark}, often ushered into being by
submission to that very ideology]{.underline}**. And **[[periodically
critical movements emerge]{.mark}, as if from nowhere, to [challenge
existing priorities at vulnerable sites]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [There
is]{.underline}, for starters, [the surprise of **the Arab Spring**,
with its ambivalent possibilities]{.underline}; [the **emergence of a
New Left** in Euro-American countries in the 1960s and
1970s]{.underline}; [the birth of **feminist and gay rights movements**
in those same countries that have probed soft spots in churches, the

critical politics. More such experiments of this sort are needed in
other domains. [There is no reason in the world to allow sensual desire

it could help to instigate and mobilize productive political activism.

#### Focus on small internal gains is key to seeking complete revolution, without state centralized goals toward anti-blackness, failure becomes inevitable 

**Connolly 13** -- William Connolly is a Professor of Political Science
@ JHU, "The Fragility of Things," 08/12/13, p. 36-42

A philosophy attending to the acceleration, expansion, irrationalities,
interdependencies, and fragilities of late capitalism suggest that [we
do not know]{.underline} that confidence, [in advance of]{.underline}
experimental [action, just how far or fast changes]{.underline} in the
systemic character of neoliberal capitalism [can be made]{.underline}.
The [structures often seem solid]{.underline} and intractable, and
indeed such a semblance may turn out to be true. Some may seem solid,
infinitely absorptive, and intractable [when they are in fact punctuated
by hidden vulnerabilities, **[soft spots]{.mark}**,
**[uncertainties]{.mark}**, [and potential **lines of flight**]{.mark}
that [become apparent when they are subjected to **experimental
action**]{.mark}]{.underline}, upheaval, [testing, and
strain]{.underline}. Indeed no ecology of late capitalism, given the
variety of forces to which it is connected by a thousand pulleys,
vibrations, impingements, dependencies, shocks, and threads, can specify
with supreme confidence the solidity or potential flexibility of the
structures it seeks to change. ¶ The strength of structural theory, at
its best, was in identifying institutional intersections that hold a
system together; its conceit, at its worst, was the claim to know in
advance how resistant such intersections are to potential change.
Without adopting the opposite conceit, [it seems important to pursue
possible sites of strategic action that might open up room for
productive change]{.underline}. Today it seems important to attend to
the relation between the need for structural change and identification
of multiple sites of potential action. [You]{.underline} [do not know
precisely what you are doing when you participate in]{.underline} such
[a venture.]{.underline} You combine an experimental temper with the
appreciation that living and acting into the future inevitably contain a
shifting quotient of uncertainty. The following tentative judgments and
sites of action may pertinent. ¶ 1) Neither neoliberal theory, nor
socialist productivism, nor deep ecology, nor social democracy in its
classic form seems sufficient to the contemporary condition. This is so
in part because the powers of market self-regulation are both real and
limited in relation to a larger multitude of heterogeneous force fields
beyond the human estate with differential power of self-regulation and
metamorphosis. A first task is to challenge neoliberal ideology through
critique and by elaborating and publicizing positive alternatives that
acknowledge the disparate relations between market processes, other
cultural systems, and nonhuman systems. Doing so to render the fragility
of things more visible and palpable. Doing so, too, to set the stage for
a series of intercoded shifts in citizen role performances, social
movements, and state action. ¶ 2) [Those who seek to
reshape]{.underline} the ecology of [late capitalism might set an
interim agenda of radial reform]{.underline} and [then recoil
back]{.underline} on the initiatives adopted to see how they work. [[An
**interim agenda is the best thing to focus on**]{.mark} because in [a
world of becoming the more distant future is too cloudy to
engage]{.mark}. [We must]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance,
[[become]{.underline}]{.mark} [[involved]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
experimental]{.underline} micro-[[politics on a variety of
fronts]{.underline}]{.mark}, as we participate in role experimentations,
social movements, artistic displays, erotic-political shows, electoral
campaigns, and creative interventions on the new media to help recode
the ethos that now occupies investment practices, consumption desires,
family savings, state priorities, church assemblies, university
curricula, and media reporting. [It is important to bear in mind
how]{.underline} extant ideologies, established role performances,
social movements, and [[commitments to **state action**
intersect]{.underline}]{.mark}. To shift some of our own role
performances in the zones of travel, church participation, home energy
use, investment, and consumption, for instance, that now implicate us
deeply in foreign oil dependence and the huge military expenditures that
secure it, could make a minor difference on its own and also lift some
of the burdens of institutional implication from us to support
participation in more adventurous interpretations, political strategies,
demands upon the state, and cross state citizen actions. ¶ 3) Today
perhaps the initial target should be on reconstituting established
patterns of consumption by a combination of direct citizens actions in
consumption choices, publicity of such actions, the organization of
local collectives to modify consumption practices, and social movements
to reconstitute the current state-and market-supported infrastructure of
consumption. By the infrastructure of consumption I mean publicly
supported and subsidized market subsystems such as a national highway
system, a system of airports, medical care through private insurance,
agribusiness pouring high sugar, salt, and fat content into foods,
corporate ownership of the public media, the prominence of corporate 403
accounts over retirement pension, and so forth that enable some modes of
consumption in the zones of travel, education, diet, retirement, medical
care, energy use, health, and education and render others much more
difficult of expensive to procure. To change the infrastructure is also
to shift the types of work and investment available. Social movements
that work upon the infrastructure and ethos of consumption in tandem can
thus make a real difference directly, encourage more people to heighten
their critical perspectives, and thereby open more people to a more
militant politics if and as the next disruptive event emerges. Perhaps
[a cross-[state citizen goal should be to construct a pluralist
assemblage]{.mark}]{.underline} by moving back and forth between
experiments in role performances, the refinement of sensitive modes of
perception, revisions in political ideology, and adjustments in
political sensibility, doing so to mobilize enough collective energy to
launch a general strike simultaneously in several countries in the near
future. [The aim of such an event would be to reverse]{.underline} the
deadly future created by established patterns of climate change by
fomenting significant shifts in patterns of consumption, corporate
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, state [**[law]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} the **[[priorities]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of interstate organizations. Again, the dilemma of today is that the
fragility of things demands shifting and slowing down intrusion: into
several aspects of nature as we speed up shifts in identity, role
performance, cultural ethos, market regulation, and state policy. ¶ 4)
The existential forces of hubris (expressed above all in those confident
drives to mastery conveyed by military elites, financial economists,
financial elites, and CEOs) and of ressentiment (expressed in some
sectors of secularism and evangelicalism) now play roles of importance
in the shape of consumption practices, investment portfolios, worker
routines, managerial demands, and the uneven semen of entitlement that
constitute neoliberalism. For that reason activism inside churches,
schools, street life, and the media must become increasingly skilled and
sensitive. As we proceed, some of us may present the themes of a world
of becoming to larger audiences, challenging thereby the complementary
notions of a providential world and secular mastery that now infuse too
many role performances, market practices, and state priorities in
capitalist life. For existential dispositions do infuse the role
priorities of late capitalism. Today it is both difficult for people to
perform the same roles with the same old innocence and difficult to
challenge those performances amid our own implication in them. Drive by
evangelists, the media, neoconservatives, and the neolibreal right to
draw a veil of innocence across the priorities of contemporary life make
the situation much worse. ¶ 5) The emergence of a neofascist or
mafia-type capitalism slinks as a dangerous possibility on the horizon,
partly because of the expansion and intensification of capital, partly
because of the real fragility of things, partly because the identity
needs of many facing these pressures encourage them to cling more
intensely to a neoliberal imaginary as its bankruptcy becomes
increasingly apparent, partly because so many in America insist upon
retaining the special world entitlements the country achieved after
World War II in a world decreasingly favorable to them, partly because
of the crisis tendencies inherent in neoliberal capitalism, and partly
because so many resist living evidence around and in them that
challenges a couple of secular and theistic images of the cosmos now
folded into the institutional life of capitalism. Indeed the danger is
that those constituencies now most disinclined to give close attention
to public issues could oscillate between attraction to the mythic
promises of neoliberal automaticity and attraction to a neofascist
movement when the next crisis unfolds. It has happened before. I am not
saying that neoliberalism is itself a form of fascism, but that the
failures and meltdowns it periodically promotes could once again foment
fascist or neofascist responses, as happened in several countries after
the onset of the Great Depression. ¶ 6) [The]{.underline} democratic
[state]{.underline}, while it certainly cannot alone tame capital or
reconstitute the ethos and infrastructure of consumption, [must play a
significant role in reconstituting our lived relations to climate,
weather, resource use, ocean currents, bee survival, tectonic
instability, glacier flows, species diversity, work, local life,
consumption, and investment]{.underline}, as **[it]{.underline}** also
**[responds]{.underline}** favorable **[to]{.underline}** the **[public
pressures]{.underline}** we must generate to forge a new ethos.
[A]{.underline} new, [new left will]{.underline} thus experimentally
enact new intersections between role performance and political activity,
[outgrow its old disgust with the very idea of the state, and remain
alert to the dangers states can pose]{.underline}. It will do so
because, as already suggested, [the fragile ecology]{.underline} of late
capital **[requires state interventions]{.underline}** of several sorts.
[A refusal to participate in the state today cedes too much hegemony to
neoliberal markets,]{.underline} either explicitly or by implication.
Drives to fascism, remember, rose the last time in capitalist states
after a total market meltdown. Most of those movements failed. But a
couple became consolidate through a series of resonances (vibrations)
back and forth between industrialists, the state, and vigilante groups,
in neighborhoods, clubs, churches, the police, the media, the pubs. [You
do not fight the danger of a new]{.underline} kind of [neofascism by
withdrawing from]{.underline} either micropolitics or [state
politics]{.underline}. You do so through a multisited politics designed
to infuse a new ethos into the fabric of everyday life. Changes in ethos
can in turn open doors to new possibilities of state and interstate
action, so that an advance in one domain seeds that in the other. And
vice versa. A positive dynamic of mutual amplification might be
generated here. Could a series of significant shifts in the routines of
state and global capitalism even press the fractures system to a point
where it hovers on the edge of capitalism itself? We don't know. [That
is one reason [it is important to focus on **interim**
**goals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Another is that in a world of becoming,
replete with periodic and surprising shift in the course of events, [you
cannot project far beyond an interim period]{.underline}. Another yet is
that [[activism needs]{.underline}]{.mark} to project [[**concrete,
interim possibilities** to gain support and propel itself
forward]{.underline}]{.mark}. That being said, it does seem unlikely to
me, at least, that a positive interim future includes either socialist
productivism or the world projected by proponents of deep ecology. ¶ 7)
To advance such an agenda [it is]{.underline} also [imperative to
negotiate new connections]{.underline} between nontheistic
constituencies [who care about the future of the Earth]{.underline} and
numerous devotees of diverse religious traditions who fold positive
spiritualties into their creedal practices. The new, multifaceted
movement needed today, if it emerges, will take the shape of a vibrant
pluralist assemblage acting at a multiple sites within and across
states, rather than either a centered movement with a series of fellow
travelers attached to it or a mere electoral constellation. **[Electoral
victories are important]{.underline}**, but that work best when they
touch priorities already embedded in churches, universities, film,
music, consumption practices, media reporting, investment priorities,
and the like. A related thing to keep in mind is that the capitalist
modes of acceleration, expansion, and intensification that heighten the
fragility of things today also generate pressures to minorities the
world along multiple dimensions at a more rapid pace than heretofore. A
new pluralist constellation will build upon the latter developments as
it works to reduce the former effects. ¶ I am sure that the forgoing
comments will appear to some as "optimistic" or "utopian." But optimism
and pessimism are both primarily spectatorial views. Neither seems
sufficient to the contemporary condition. Indeed
[pessimism]{.underline}, if you dwell on it long, [easily slides into
cynicism, and cynicism often plays into the hands of a right wing that
applies it exclusively to any set of state activities not designed to
protect or coddle the corporate estate. That is one reason that
"dysfunctional politics" resounds so readily to]{.underline} the
advantage of [cynics on the right]{.underline} who work to promote it.
[They want to promote cynicism with respect to the state and innocence
with respect to the market.]{.underline} Pure critique, as already
suggested, does not suffice either. [Pure critique too readily carries
critics]{.underline} and their followers [to]{.underline} the edge of
[cynicism]{.underline}. ¶ It is also true that the above critique
concentrates on neoliberal capitalism, not capitalism writ large. That
is because it seems to me that we need to specify the terms of critique
as closely as possible and think first of all about interim responses.
If we lived under, say, Keynesian capitalism, a somewhat different set
of issues would be defined and other strategies identified. Capitalism
writ large---while it sets a general context that neoliberalism inflects
in specific ways---sets too large and generic a target. It can assume
multiple forms, as the difference between Swedish and American
capitalism suggest the times demand a set of interim agendas targeting
the hegemonic form of today, pursued with heightened militancy at
several sties. [**The point today is not to wait for a revolution that
overthrows the whole system**. The "system,"]{.underline} as we shall
see further, [is replete with too many loose ends]{.underline}, uneven
edges, dicey intersections with nonhuman [forces, and uncertain
trajectories]{.underline} to make such a wholesale project plausible.
Besides, [things are too urgent and too many people on the ground are
suffering too much now]{.underline}. ¶ [[The need now is to
activate]{.underline}]{.mark} the most promising **[[political
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the contemporary condition out of a
bad set. On top of assessing probabilities and predicting them with
secret relish or despair---activities I myself pursue during the
election season---we must define the urgent needs of the day in relation
to a set of interim possibilities worthy of pursuit on several fronts,
even if the apparent political odds are stacked against them. We then
test ourselves and those possibilities by trying to enact this or that
aspect of them at diverse sites, turning back to reconsider their
efficacy and side effects as circumstances shift and results accrue. [In
so doing [we may experience more vibrantly how apparently
closed]{.mark}]{.underline} [and ossified [structures are typically
punctuated by jagged edges, seams, and fractures]{.underline}]{.mark}
best [pried open with]{.underline} a mix of public contestation of
established interpretations, [[experimental shifts
in]{.underline}]{.mark} multiple role performances, micropolitics in
churches, **[[universities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, unions, the media,
and corporations, [[**state actions**, and]{.underline}]{.mark}
large-scale, [[cross-state citizen actions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

legitimize oppression. Those who control the system weaken resistance by
pointing to the occasional concession to]{.underline}, or periodic court

common law or using the case method in law school is a disguised means
of preaching incrementalism and thereby maintaining the current power

the case method, give up the effort to ﬁnd rationality and order in the

[Critics of existentialism often reject its human formulation.
Heidegger, for instance, in his ''Letter on Humanism,'' lambasted Sartre
for supposedly in effect subordinating Being to a philosophical
anthropology with dangers of anthropocentrism (Heidegger, 1971). Yet a
philosophical understanding of culture raises the problem of the
conditions through which philosophical reflections could emerge as
meaningful. Although a human activity, a more radical understanding of
culture raises the question of the human being as the producer of an
open reality[. **If the human being is in the making**]{.mark}**, then
''[human reality'' is never complete]{.mark}** and is more the relations
in which such thought takes place than a claim about the
thought.]{.underline} The etymology of existence already points to these
elements. From the Latin ex sistere, ''to stand out,'' it also means to
appear; against invisibility in the stream of effects through which the
human world appears, much appears through the creative and at times
alchemic force of human thought and deed. Quarrels with and against
existential thought are many. In more recent times, they've emerged
primarily from Marxists, structuralists, and poststructuralists, even
though there were, and continue to be, many existential Marxists and
even existentialists with structuralist and poststructuralist leanings.
[I begin with this tale of philosophical abstraction to contextualize
**[Afropessimism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Its main exemplars, such as
Jared Sexton and Frank Wilderson III, emerged from academic literary
theory, an area dominated by poststructuralism even in many cases that
avow ''Marxism.'' Sexton (2010) and Wilderson (2007) divert from a
reductive poststructuralism, however, through examining important
existential moves inaugurated, as Daniel McNeil (2011, 2012) observed,
by Fanon and his intellectual heirs. The critical question that
Afropessimism addresses in this fusion is the viability of posed
strategies of Black liberation. (I'm using the capital ''B'' here to
point not only to the racial designation ''black'' but also to the
nationalist one ''Black.'' Afropessimists often mean both, since blacks
and Blacks have a central and centered role in their thought.) The world
that produced blacks and in consequence Blacks is, for Afropessimists, a
crushing, historical one whose Manichaean divide is sustained contraries
best kept segregated. Worse, any effort of mediation leads to confirmed
black subordination. Overcoming this requires purging the world of
antiblackness. Where cleansing the world is unachievable, an alternative
is to disarm the force of antiblack racism. Where whites lack power over
blacks, they lose relevance -- at least politically and at levels of
cultural and racial capital or hegemony. Wilderson (2008), for instance,
explores my concept of ''an antiblack world'' to build similar
arguments. Sexton (2011) makes similar moves in his discussions of
''social death.'' As this forum doesn't afford space for a long
critique, [**I'll offer several, non-exhaustive criticisms.** [The first
is that ''**an antiblack world'' is not identical with ''the world is
antiblack**]{.mark}.'' My argument is that **such [a world is an
antiblack racist project]{.mark}**. It is not the historical
achievement. **Its limitations emerge from a basic fact: Black people
and other opponents of such a project** fought, and **continue to
fight**, as we see today in the #BlackLivesMatter movement and many
others, against it.]{.underline} The same argument applies to the
argument about social death. Such an achievement would have rendered
even these reflections stillborn. [**The basic premises of the
[Afropessimistic]{.mark} [argument]{.mark} are**, then, **[locked in
performative contradictions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Yet, they have
rhetorical force. This is evident through the continued growth of its
proponents and forums (such as this one) devoted to it. In Bad Faith and
Antiblack Racism, I argued that there are forms of antiblack racism
offered under the guise of love, though I was writing about whites who
exoticize blacks while offering themselves as white sources of black
value. Analyzed in terms of bad faith, where one lies to oneself in an
attempt to flee displeasing truths for pleasing falsehoods, exoticists
romanticize blacks while affirming white normativity, and thus
themselves, as principals of reality. These ironic, performative
contradictions are features of all forms of racism, where one group is
elevated to godlike status and another is pushed below that of human
despite both claiming to be human. Antiblack racism offers whites
self-other relations (necessary for ethics) with each other but not so
for groups forced in a ''zone of nonbeing'' below them. There is
asymmetry where whites stand as others who look downward to those who
are not their others or their analogues. [[Antiblack racism is]{.mark}
thus [not a problem of]{.mark} blacks [being ''others]{.mark}.'' [It's a
problem of their not-being-analogical-selves]{.mark}-and-not-even-
being-others.]{.underline} Fanon, in Black Skin, White Masks (1952),
reminds us that Blacks among each other live in a world of selves and
others. It is in attempted relations with whites that these problems
occur. Reason in such contexts has a bad habit of walking out when
Blacks enter. What are Blacks to do? As reason cannot be forced, because
that would be ''violence,'' they must ironically reason reasonably with
forms of unreasonable reason. [Contradictions loom. Racism is, given
these arguments, a project of imposing non-relations as the model of
dealing with people designated ''black.'']{.underline} In Les Damne ́ de
la terre (''Damned of the Earth''), Fanon goes further and argues that
colonialism is an attempt to impose a Manichean structure of contraries
instead of a dialectical one of ongoing, human negotiation of
contradictions. The former segregates the groups; the latter emerges
from interaction. The police, he observes, are the mediator in such a
situation, as their role is force/violence instead of the human,
discursive one of politics and civility (Fanon, 1991). Such societies
draw legitimacy from Black non-existence or invisibility. Black
appearance, in other words, would be a violation of those systems. Think
of the continued blight of police, extra-judicial killings of Blacks in
those countries. An immediate observation of many postcolonies is that
antiblack attitudes, practices, and institutions aren't exclusively
white. [Black antiblack dispositions make this clear. **Bl[a]{.mark}ck
[antiblackness]{.mark} [entails Black exoticism]{.mark}**. Where this
exists, **[Blacks simultaneously receive Black love alongside Black
rejection of agency]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Many problems follow. [[The
absence of agency]{.mark} bars maturation, which would [reinforce the
racial logic of Blacks]{.mark} as in effect wards of whites. **[Without
agency]{.mark}, ethics, liberation, maturation, [politics]{.mark}, [and
responsibility could not be possible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Afropessimism faces the problem of a hidden premise of white agency
versus Black incapacity]{.underline}. Proponents of Afropessimism would
no doubt respond that the theory itself is a form of agency reminiscent
of Fanon's famous remark that though whites created le Ne\`gre it was
les Ne\`gres who created Ne ́gritude. Whites clearly did not create
Afropessimism, which Black liberationists should celebrate. We should
avoid the fallacy, however, of confusing source with outcome. History is
not short of bad ideas from good people. If intrinsically good, however,
each person of African descent would become ethically and
epistemologically a switching of the Manichean contraries, which means
only changing players instead of the game. We come, then, to the crux of
the matter. [[If]{.mark} [the goal of Afropessimism is
Afropessimism]{.mark}, [its achievement would be attitudinal]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}, in the language of old, stoic -- in short[, **a symptom of
antiblack society**]{.mark}.]{.underline} At this point, there are
several observations that follow. The first is a diagnosis of the
implications of Afropessimism as symptom. The second examines the
epistemological implications of Afropessimism. The third is whether a
disposition counts as a political act and, if so, is it sufficient for
its avowed aims. There are more, but for the sake of brevity, I'll
simply focus on these. An ironic dimension of pessimism is that it is
the other side of optimism. Oddly enough, both are connected to
nihilism, which is, as Nietzsche (1968) showed, a decline of values
during periods of social decay. It emerges when people no longer want to
be responsible for their actions. Optimists expect intervention from
beyond. Pessimists declare relief is not forthcoming. Neither takes
responsibility for what is valued. The valuing, however, is what leads
to the second, epistemic point. [The presumption that what is at stake
is what can be known to determine what can be done is the
problem.]{.underline} If such knowledge were possible, the debate would
be about who is reading the evidence correctly. Such judgment would be a
priori -- that is, prior to events actually unfolding. [**[The
future]{.mark}, unlike transcendental conditions such as language,
signs, and reality, [is]{.mark}, however, [ex post facto]{.mark}: [It is
yet to come]{.mark}. [Facing the future]{.mark}, [the question isn't
what will be]{.mark}** or how do we know what will be **but [instead the
realization that whatever is done will be that]{.mark} [on which the
future will depend]{.mark}**. Rejecting optimism and pessimism, there is
[a]{.mark} supervening alternative: **[political commitment]{.mark}**.
The appeal to political commitment is not only in stream with what
French existentialists call l'intellectuel engage ́ (committed
intellectual) but also **re[aches back through the history]{.mark} and
existential situation [of]{.mark} enslaved, [racialized
ancestors]{.mark}. Many were**, in truth, **an existential paradox:
commitment to action without guarantees. [The slave revolts]{.mark},
[micro and macro acts of resistance]{.mark}, escapes, and returns help
others do the same**; the [cultivated instability of plantations]{.mark}
and other forms of enslavement, and **countless other actions, were
waged against a gauntlet of forces designed to eliminate any hope of
success**. The claim of colonialists and enslavers was that the future
belonged to them, not to the enslaved and the indigenous.]{.underline} A
result of more than 500 years of conquest and 300 years of enslavement
was also a (white) rewriting of history in which African and First
Nations' agency was, at least at the level of scholarship, nearly
erased. Yet there was resistance even in that realm, as Africana and
First Nation intellectual history and scholarship attest. Such actions
set the course for different kinds of struggle today. [Such reflections
occasion meditations on the concept of failure.
**[Afropessimism]{.mark}**, the existential critique suggests,
**[suffers from a failure to understand failure]{.mark}**. Consider
Fanon's notion of **constructive failure, where what doesn't initially
work transforms conditions for something new to emerge**.]{.underline}
To understand this argument, one must rethink the philosophical
anthropology at the heart of a specific line of Euromodern thought on
what it means to be human. Atomistic and individual- substance-based,
this model, articulated by Hobbes, Locke, and many others, is of a
non-relational being that thinks, acts, and moves along a course in
which continued movement depends on not colliding with others. [Under
that model, the human being is a thing that enters a system that
facilitates or obstructs its movement. An alternative model, shared by
many groups across southern Africa, is a relational version of the human
being as part of a larger system of meaning. Actions, from that
perspective, **are not about whether ''I'' succeed but instead about
''our'' story across time**. As relational, it means that **[each human
being is a constant negotiation of ongoing efforts]{.mark} to build
relationships with others**, which means **[no one]{.mark} actually
[enters a situation without establishing new situations of]{.mark}
action and [meaning]{.mark}**. Instead of **entering a game**, their
participation **requires a different kind of project** -- **especially
where the ''game'' was premised on their exclusion**. Thus, [where
the]{.mark} system or [game repels]{.mark} initial
[participation]{.mark}, such [repulsion is a shift in the
grammar]{.mark} of how the system functions, especially its dependence
on obsequious subjects. **Shifted energy [affords emergence of
alternatives]{.mark}. Kinds cannot be known before the actions that
birthed them**. Abstract as this sounds, it has much historical support.
Evelyn Simien (2016), in her insightful political study Historic Firsts,
examines the new set of relations established by Shirley Chisholm's and
Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns. There could be no Barack Obama
without such important predecessors affecting the demographics of voter
participation.]{.underline} Simien intentionally focused on the most
mainstream example of political life to illustrate this point. Although
no exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success'' emerged from Chisholm and
Jackson's (and many others') so-called ''failure.'' [Beyond presidential
electoral politics, **there are numerous [examples]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[how]{.mark} prior**, [radical]{.mark} so-called ''**[failures''
transformed relationships]{.mark}** that facilitated other kinds of
outcome. The trail goes back to **[the Haitian Revolution]{.mark}** and
back to every act of resistance from **[Nat Turner's Rebellion]{.mark}**
in the USA, **[Sharpe's in Jamaic]{.mark}a**, or **[Tula's in Curac
̧ao]{.mark}** and so many other efforts for social transformation to
come.]{.underline} [In existential terms, then, many ancestors of the
African diaspora embodied what Søren Kierkegaard (1983) calls **an
existential paradox. All the evidence around them suggested failure and
the futility of hope.** They first had to make a movement of infinite
resignation -- that is, resigning themselves to their situation. Yet
they must simultaneously act against that situation.]{.underline}
Kierkegaard called this seemingly contradictory phenomenon ''faith,''
but that concept relates more to a relationship with a transcendent,
absolute being, which could only be established by a ''leap,'' as there
are no mediations or bridge. [Ironically, if Afropessimism appeals to
transcendent intervention, it would collapse into faith. If, however,
the argument rejects transcendent intervention and focuses on committed
political action, of taking responsibility for a future that offers no
guarantees, then **[the movement from infinite resignation becomes
existential political action]{.mark}**. At this point, **the crucial
meditation would be on** politics and **political action**. [An attitude
of infinite resignation]{.mark} to the world without the leap of
committed action would simply be pessimistic or nihilistic.]{.underline}
Similarly, an attitude of hope or optimism about the future would lack
infinite resignation. We see here the underlying failure of the two
approaches. Yet ironically, there is a form of failure at failing in the
pessimistic turn versus the optimistic one, since if focused exclusively
on resignation as the goal, then the ''act'' of resignation would have
been achieved, which, paradoxically, would be a success; it would be a
successful failing of failure. [**[For politics]{.mark} to emerge,
however, [there are two missing elements in inward pessimistic
resignation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The first is that [politics is a
social phenomenon]{.mark}, which means it requires the expanding options
of a social world. Turning away from the social world, though a
statement about politics, **is not**, however, in and of itself
**political**. [The ancients]{.mark} from whom much western political
theory or philosophy claimed affinity [had]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
disparaging [term for individuals who resigned themselves]{.mark} from
political life: idio ̄te ̄s, a private person, one not concerned with
public affairs, in a word [-- **an idiot**]{.mark}.]{.underline} I
mention western political theory because that is the hegemonic
intellectual context of Afropessimism. We don't, however, have to end
our etymological journey in ancient Greek. Extending our linguistic
archaeology back a few thousand years, we could examine the Middle
Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on by the
ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack of hearing entailed
isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. [The contemporary inward
[resignation]{.mark} of seeking a form of purity from the loathsome
historical reality of racial oppression, in this reading,
**[collapses]{.mark} ultimately [into]{.mark} a form of
[moralism]{.mark}** (private, normative satisfaction) **[instead of
public responsibility]{.mark} born of and borne by
action**.]{.underline} The second is the importance of power. Politics
makes no sense without it. But what is power? Eurocentric etymology
points to the Latin word potis as its source, from which came the word
''potent'' as in an omnipotent god. If we again look back further, we
will notice the Middle Kingdom (2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word
pHty, which refers to godlike strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast
Africans, even the gods' abilities came from a source: In the Coffin
Texts, HqAw or heka activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul,
spirit, or, in a word, ''magic''), which makes reality. All this amounts
to a straightforward thesis on power as the ability with the means to
make things happen. There is an alchemical quality to power. [The human
world, premised on symbolic communication, brings many forms of meaning
into being, and those **new meanings afford relationships that build
institutions through a world of culture, a phenomenon** that Freud
(1989) rightly **described as ''a prosthetic god.''**]{.underline} It is
godlike because it addresses what humanity historically sought from the
gods: protection from the elements, physical maledictions, and social
forms of misery. Such power clearly can be abused. It is where those
enabling capacities (empowerment) are pushed to the wayside in the
hording of social resources into propping up some people as gods that
the legitimating practices of cultural cum political institutions
decline and stimulate pessimism and nihilism. That institutions in the
Americas very rarely attempt establishing positive relations to Blacks
is the subtext of Afropessimism and this entire meditation. [The
discussion points, however, to a demand for political
commitment.]{.underline} Politics itself emerges under different names
throughout the history of our species, but the one occasioning the word
''politics'' is from the Greek po ́lis, which refers to ancient Hellenic
city-states. It identifies specific kinds of activities conducted inside
the city-state, where order necessitated the resolution of conflicts
through rules of discourse the violation of which could lead to (civil)
war, a breaking down of relations appropriate for ''outsiders.''
Returning to the Fanonian observation of selves and others, it is clear
that imposed limitations on certain groups amounts to impeding or
blocking the option of politics. Yet, as a problem occurring within the
polity, the problem short of war becomes a political one. Returning to
Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this: If the problem of
antiblack racism is conceded as political, where antiblack institutions
of power have, as their project, the impeding of Black power, which in
effect requires barring Black access to political institutions, then
antiblack societies are ultimately threats also to politics defined as
the human negotiation of the expansion of human capabilities or more to
the point: freedom. [**[Anti-politics is]{.mark} one of [the
reasons]{.mark} [why]{.mark}** societies in which antiblack racism is
hegemonic are also those in which **[racial moralizing
dominates]{.mark}: mor[alizing stops at individuals at the expense of
addressing institutions]{.mark}** the transformation of which would make
immoral individuals irrelevant. **As a political problem, it demands a
political solution**. It is not accidental that Blacks continue to be
the continued exemplars of unrealized freedom. As so many from Ida B.
Wells-Barnett to Angela Davis (2003) and Michelle Alexander (2010) have
shown, **the expansion of privatization and incarceration is squarely
placed in a structure of states and civil societies premised on the
limitations of freedom** (Blacks) -- ironically, as seen in countries
such as South Africa and the United States, in the name of
freedom.]{.underline} That power is a facilitating or enabling
phenomenon, a functional element of the human world, a viable response
must be the establishing of relations that reach beyond the singularity
of the body. [I bring this up because proponents of Afropessimism might
object to this analysis because of its appeal to a human
world.]{.underline} If that world is abrogated, the site of struggle
becomes that which is patently not human. It is not accidental that
popular race discourse refers today to ''black bodies,'' for instance,
instead of ''black people.'' [As [the human world is discursiv]{.mark}e,
social, and relational, [this abandonment amounts to an appeal to the
non-relational]{.mark}, the incommunicability of singularity, and
appeals to the body and its reach. At that point, it's perhaps the
psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychoanalyst who would be helpful, as
**turning radically inward offers the promise of despair, narcissistic
delusions of godliness, and**, as Fanon also observed, **madness**. Even
if that slippery slope were rejected, **[the performative contradiction
of attempting to communicate such singularity or absence thereof
requires]{.mark}**, at least for consistency, **[the appropriate course
of action: silence]{.mark}**. The remaining question for Afropessimism,
especially those who are primarily academics, becomes this: **[Why
write?]{.mark}** It's a question for which, in both existential and
political terms[, **I don't see how an answer could be given**]{.mark}
from an Afropessimistic perspective without the unfortunate revelation
of cynicism. **[The marketability of Afropessimism is]{.mark}** no doubt
**[in]{.mark} [the]{.mark} immediate** and [paradoxical]{.mark}
[satisfaction in **dissatisfaction**]{.mark} it offers. We are at this
point on familiar terrain. As with ancient logical paradoxes denying the
viability of time and motion, the best option, after a moment of
immobilized reflection, is, eventually, to move on, even where the pause
is itself significant as an encomium of thought.]{.underline}

### Lawson

#### The alt is especially irresponsible when interpreted at the international level -- empirical analysis confirms that domestic revolutions merely become fodder for interstate competition under conditions of anarchy -- results in the continuance of anti-blackness and the death of millions.

**Lawson 15** -- (2015, George, PhD, Associate Professor in
International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political
Science, "Revolutions and the international," Theor Soc (2015)
44:299--319)

[[Revolutions]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[challenge international
order in a number of ways]{.underline}]{.mark}, ranging from disrupting
existing patterns of trade and inter-state alliances to questioning
underlying rules, norms, and principles. Haiti, discussed above, serves
as one such example. The Bolshevik revolution in Russia provides a
second. The challenges of the 1917 revolution were short-term (prompting
the withdrawal of Russian forces from World War One), medium-term (in
the provision of support for like-minded movements--the Soviet Union
invaded Poland in 1920, provided aid for German revolutionaries in 1923,
supported the republicans during the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 39,
and helped to install socialist regimes in Europe and Asia during the
late 1940s), and long-term (in the establishment of a systemic
alternative to market-democracy). [[As with other revolutions, the
outcomes of the Bolshevik revolution included new military and economic
alliances that]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[induced a conflict
between the revolutionary state and a counter-revolutionary
coalition]{.mark} that sought to contain it]{.underline}. [The Bolshevik
revolution, [like those in Haiti, France, China, Cuba, Iran, and
elsewhere]{.mark}, challenged the credibility of the existing
international system and, with it, the credibility of the system's great
powers. This, naturally, prompted a response]{.underline}: [to justify
their position at the apex of the international system, great powers
must act decisively in the face of a revolutionary
challenge]{.underline} (Bisley 2004, p. 56). [Occasionally, this action
takes place in support of the revolutionary movement, as with the 1989
revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [More
frequently, great powers act to suppress such revolutions]{.underline},
seeing them as threats to international order, as was the case in Haiti,
France, Russia, Algeria, Vietnam, and elsewhere.14 In this way,
**[[counter-revolution should not be seen as an instrumental reaction to
moments of revolutionary upheaval, but as a process hard-wired into the
fundamentals of international relations itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Mayer 1977).

[If the relationship between revolution and counter-revolution is
tightly meshed, [so too is the relationship between revolution and
war]{.mark}. On the one hand, [revolutionary states are far more likely
than other states to enter into violent civil war]{.mark}]{.underline}:
[**[over one million people died in the Mexican
revolution]{.underline}** [and the country's **subsequent civil
unrest**]{.underline}]{.mark} between 1910 and 1917, around three
million people died in the Russian revolution and civil war between 1917
and 1920, [[and]{.mark} close to **[five million Chinese were
killed]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the first 5 years of
[Mao's]{.mark}]{.underline} post-1949 revolutionary
[[regime]{.underline}]{.mark} (Beissinger 2014, p. 6; Westad 2012, p.
322). [On the other hand, rev[olutionary states are twice as likely as
non-revolutionary states to **induce inter-state
war**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Maoz 1989, p. 204). As Walt (1996) notes,
revolutions intensify the prospects of war in three ways. First,
**[[revolutions provide a window of opportunity for states to improve
their position vis-à-vis other states]{.underline}]{.mark}**---because
revolutionary regimes are beset by civil strife and elite fracture,
other states may seize the chance to attack the revolutionary regime.
[Second, [this window]{.mark} of opportunity
[generates]{.mark}]{.underline} B **[[spirals of
suspicion]{.underline}]{.mark}**\^ as the uncertainty produced by the
revolution heightens levels of insecurity that, in turn, raise
perceptions of threat (Walt 1996, p. 33). [Finally, **[revolutionary
states seek to export their revolution]{.mark}** both as a way of
shoring up their fragile position at home and because of their
ideological commitment to an alternative international
order]{.underline}. Concomitantly, **[[counter-revolutionary states
assume that the revolution will spread unless]{.mark}]{.underline}** it
is B **[[strangled in its crib]{.underline}]{.mark}**\^ and that
revolution will be relatively easy to reverse (Walt 1996, p. 43).
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} B [perverse combination]{.underline}\^ [of
insecurity and overconfidence **[heightens the prospects of inter-state
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Walt 1996, p. 40). By increasing
uncertainty and fear, by altering capabilities, and by raising threat
perceptions, revolutionary states begin a process that, quite often,
engenders inter-state conflict. War between revolutionary and
counter-revolutionary forces emerges from an Bover-reaction to
over-perceived revolutionary dangers\^ (Mayer 1977, p. 202).

### Kline

#### Ontologizing blackness destroys alt solvency and homogenizes black bodies

David **KLINE**, Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Religion at Rice
University, **17** \["The Pragmatics of Resistance: Framing
Anti-Blackness and the Limits of Political Ontology," *Critical
Philosophy of Race*, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2017, p. 51-69, Accessed Online
through Emory Libraries\]

Focusing on Wilderson, his **[[absolute prioritization of a political
onto-logical structure]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which the law relegates
Black being into the singular position of social death happens, I
contend, at the expense of two significant things that I am hesitant to
bracket for the sake of prioritizing political ontology as the sole
frame of reference for both analyzing anti-Black racism and thinking
resistance within the racialized world. First, it [**[short-circuits an
analysis of power that might reveal]{.mark}** not only **[how]{.mark}**
the **[practices]{.mark}**, forms, and **[apparatuses of anti-Black
racism have historically developed]{.mark}**, changed, and
reassembled/reterritorialized in relation to state power, national
identity, philosophical discourse, biological discourse, political
discourse, and so on---changes that, despite Wilderson's claim that
focusing on these things only "mystify" the question of
ontology]{.underline} (Wilderson 2010, 10), surely have implications for
how racial positioning is both thought and resisted in differing
historical and socio-political contexts. To the extent that Blackness
equals a singular ontological position within a macropolitical structure
of antagonism, there is almost no room to bring in the spectrum and flow
of social difference and contingency that no doubt spans across Black
identity as a legitimate issue of analysis and as a site/sight for the
possibility of a range of resisting practices. This bracketing of
difference leads him to make some rather sweeping and opaquely abstract
claims. For example, discussing a main character's abortion in a prison
cell in the 1976 film Bush Mama, Wilderson says, "Dorothy will abort her
baby at the clinic or on the floor of her prison cell, not because she
fights for---and either wins \[End Page 58\] or loses---the right to do
so, but because she is one of 35 million accumulated and fungible (owned
and exchangeable) objects living among 230 million subjects---which is
to say, her will is always already subsumed by the will of civil
society" (Wilderson 2010, 128, italics mine). What I want to press here
is how Wilderson's statement, made in the sole frame of a [**[totalizing
political ontology]{.mark}** overshadowing all other levels of
sociality, **[flattens]{.mark}** out the **[social difference
within]{.mark}**, and even the possibility of, **[a micropolitical
social field of 35 million Black people]{.mark}** living in the United
States]{.underline}. [Such a flattening reduces the optic of anti-Black
racism as well as Black sociality to the frame of political ontology
where **[Blackness remains stuck in a singular position of
abjection]{.mark}**. **[The result is a severe analytical limitation
in]{.mark}** terms of **[the way Blackness]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as
well as other racial positions) [**[exists across an extremely wide
field of sociality]{.mark}** that is **[comprised of differing]{.mark}**
intensities of **[forces]{.mark}** and relational modes **[between
various]{.mark}** institutional, political, socio-[**economic**,
**religious, sexual, and other social
conjunctures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within Wilderson's political
ontological frame, [it seems that these conjunctures are excluded---or
at least bracketed---as having any bearing at all on how anti-Black
power functions and is resisted across highly differentiated
contexts]{.underline}. [**[There is only the binary]{.mark}**
ontological distinction **[of Black and Human]{.mark}** being; only a
macropolitics of sedimented abjection]{.underline}.

#### Pragmatism is key to challenge anti-blackness, only state reform brings change

**Kline 17** (David Kline is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of
Religion at Rice University. Critical Philosophy of Race, Volume 5,
Issue 1, 2017

This is where I [suggest the [decentering]{.mark} of [political ontology
and the inclusion of the Black]{.mark} aleatory [body]{.mark} as the
site of struggle, evasion, and [creation becomes a pragmatic
mode]{.mark} of framing the problem and thinking a purely practical
politics of both spontaneous creation and a calculated movement against
the political ontological regime of anti-Blackness]{.underline}.
Although Moten would certainly object to describing this turn by way of
a "pragmatic politics," I suggest that his "Black optimism" and
Chandler's paraontology find congruence with a kind of
Foucaultian-Deleuzian pragmatics which, as Paul Patton describes
Deleuze's philosophy, "\[enables\] a form of description which is
immediately practical" and an "ethico-political conception of philosophy
as oriented towards the possibility of change" (Patton 2003, 16, 17).
From this angle, [**[the accurate representation of an ontological
reality]{.mark}, while**]{.underline} certainly necessary and
**[[crucial to the task of naming the full scope of the
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}** and thinking a way forward[, **does not
take precedence over the task of creating new concepts and lines of
flight that should be judged on their effectiveness not in terms of
properly representing an ontological problem, but in terms of their
concrete effects within a wide field of contexts, specific
socio-political problems, and conjunctures**]{.underline}. As Deleuze
and Guattari describe how pragmatics marks a study attuned to the
**[[complexity, contingency, and potential danger that defines the
micropolitical]{.mark},]{.underline}** "the study of the dangers of each
line is the object of pragmatics or schizoanalysis, to the extent that
it undertakes not to represent, interpret, or symbolize, but only to
make maps and draw lines, marking their mixtures as well as their
distinctions" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 227). Pragmatics, in this way,
is all about drawing lines and making maps against macropolitical
sedimentations that lead somewhere, that create something new. Such
pragmatic orientation is especially pertinent in the contemporary
biopolitical frame as Foucault understands it. As I've already
described, Foucault's biopolitics is premised on the idea that when
politics takes the biological body as its primary aim and object, as
opposed to sovereign power's object of the legal subject and its
constitutive negative, then there is introduced into politics the
possibility, as Cary Wolfe notes, "for life to burst through power's
systematic operations in ways that are more and more difficult to
anticipate" (Wolfe 2014, 158). The increasing complexity of bodily
knowledge and the power that takes this knowledge as its operating
principle means that both risk and possibility increase in terms of what
the body can do and what can be done to the body. The pragmatic thrust
of this emerges when situating it at the level of micropolitics, where,
as I've been describing, Deleuze and Guattari locate the conditions for
lines of flight and where "there is always something that flows or
flees, that escapes the binary organizations, the resonance apparatus,
and the overcoding machine" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 216). Out of any
sedimentation there will always be deterritorialization and
reterritorialization. The pragmatic possibility or potential, then, is
that **[there is always a [simultaneity of]{.mark} the
[micropolitical]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [macropolitical]{.mark} that
[provides the conditions for]{.mark} an ongoing search for [new
tactics]{.mark}, orientations, assemblages, vocabularies, and processes
of becoming that are aimed practically towards change:]{.underline}**
"What matters is to break through the wall, even if one has to
become-black like John Brown. George Jackson. 'I may take flight, but
all the while I am fleeing, I will be looking for a weapon!" (Deleuze
and Guattari 2009, 277). **[This emphasis on [pragmatics]{.mark} and
lines of flight]{.underline}**---both in potentially negative and
positive terms (i.e. in terms of pure
contingency)---[**[provide]{.mark}s [a]{.mark} much [more expansive
level for framing the problem of anti-Blackness that is not reducible to
fixed political ontological positions and the macropolitical
plane]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Finally, I suggest this kind of
pragmatics is what Moten and Harney describe as "fugitive planning and
Black study," what Jack Halberstam \[End Page 65\] characterizes simply
as "reaching out to find connection" (Moten and Harney 2013, 5).
[Pragmatics finds a footing in]{.mark} the highly dynamic and
[shifting]{.mark} terrain of [power relations]{.mark} and its
multiplicity of conjunctures that signal the condition of movement and
connection. It finds its enactment in sites such as "the little Negro's
church and logos and gathering, this gathering in and against the word,
alongside and through the word and the world as hold, manger,
wilderness, tomb, upper room, and cell" (Moten 2014, 775). Within these
and [other sites of micropolitical connection and the practices that
take place in them]{.mark}, there is flight, resistance, [and the
creation of something new and productive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
inclusion of these sites and practices within the analytical frame and
critique of anti-Blackness provide a much wider set of resources for
thinking the complexity of the full scope of the political field that
exists in excess to the political ontological frame]{.underline}, and,
in the same way, orients the fight against anti-Blackness in practical
(though potentially no less revolutionary), rather than apocalyptic,
terms. This, I argue, does not have to mitigate or pass over Sexton's
call that "slavery must be theorized maximally if its abolition is to
reach the proper level" (Sexton 2011, 33). **[The maximum theorization
of slavery and anti-Blackness does not need be completely hedged in by a
political ontological frame]{.underline}**. However, analytical
expansion beyond the political ontological frame does mean locating a
positive emphasis on what Sexton disparagingly identifies as a tendency
towards "forces of mitigation that would transform the world through a
coalition of a thousand tiny causes" (ibid.). [Taking Sexton's (and
Wilderson's) call of a maximum theorization of slavery/anti-Blackness
with full seriousness, I wonder what the proper level of abolition could
possibly mean other than **a pragmatic coalition---or a
micropolitics---of a thousand tiny causes.**]{.underline} As I've
argued, thinking what this might mean would certainly necessitate an
expansive analytics of power relations flowing over a highly complex
field of forces, intensities, technologies, and dispositifs that
together form a micropolitical field far in excess of sovereign power
and the political ontological frame. Out of such an analytics, a
pragmatics that finds its possibility in the micropolitical field of
movement and flight emerges as the condition for an ongoing life of
resistance, connection, and a movement toward freedom.

### Payne

#### Putin's [revisionist]{.underline}\-\--only [deterrence]{.underline} prevents him from [invading the Baltics]{.underline}. 

**Payne '19** --- Dr. Keith B. Payne is a co-founder of the National
Institute for Public Policy, head of the Graduate School of Defense and
Strategic Studies at Missouri State University. (1-3-2019; \"The
Emerging Nuclear Environment: Two Challenges Ahead;\" *Real Clear
Defense*;
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2019/01/03/the_emerging_nuclear_environment_two_challenges_ahead_114074.html;
//GrRv)

[There are multiple emerging or potential nuclear challenges, including
from North Korea, China, and Iran]{.underline}. But, here [I will
comment on only the most **apparent**, **immediate** external nuclear
challenge]{.underline}---[which I believe to be **Russia**]{.underline}.
[The Russian nuclear challenge follows from the combination of Russia's
goal to **revise** the existing international political
order,]{.underline} and the apparent role Moscow envisages for its
nuclear forces in advancing that goal.

[What is the **geographic extent** of Russia's **revisionist
goal?**]{.underline} The answer to this key question is unclear. Perhaps
the geographic extent corresponds to that of the former territory of the
Soviet Union, or perhaps to the expanse of the earlier Imperial Russia.
[It is not obvious what the current leadership in Moscow believes to be
the rightful boundaries of Russia]{.underline}. Whatever may be the
case, [it is clear that [Moscow's leadership aspires to **return to past
greatness**, and **doing so** involves
**geography**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

While [political geography]{.underline} may seem an archaic national
focus to many in the West, it [remains a **prominent theme** in Russian
security thinking.]{.underline} This should be no surprise given Russian
history and the value of its expansive territory for power and
survival---from Napoleon's invasion in 1812 to Hitler's invasion in
1941.

It also is unclear whether, or how much of Russia's geographic goal
would be satisfied with: 1) Political/economic hegemony over its desired
historic space; 2) the actual incorporation within Russian borders of
now-external territory and ethnic Russian populations; or, 3) a
combination of these two.

The first of these---[[seeking]{.mark}
**political**]{.underline}/economic
**[[hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**--[[is a **threat** to]{.mark} the
**sovereignty of [Russia's neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The second
of these--[the incorporation of territory and ethnic Russian populations
into the Russian homeland--is a possible threat to **neighbors' national
survival.**]{.underline}

Over the past ten years, [we have seen evidence of both
approaches:]{.underline} [Russia's [operations in
**Crimea**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[suggest the goal of
**expanding**]{.mark} **Russian [borders]{.mark}** [and
**absorbing**]{.mark} **ethnic Russian [populations]{.mark}**. Russia's
political and economic efforts elsewhere suggest the goal of
establishing a form of economic and political hegemony]{.underline}.

Whatever are the parameters and nature of Russia's territorial
ambitions, [it is clear that, given the expansion of NATO since the end
of the Cold War, Russia's revisionist goal may be satisfied at the
expense of our allies' and partners' sovereignty or
territory]{.underline}. As a former U.S. intelligence official
reportedly stated, "[[Everything for]{.mark} Vladimir [Putin is]{.mark}
a **[zero-sum]{.mark} game**, and we are his main enemy]{.underline}.
[The Russians are continually probing us, and [they're going to **keep
going**]{.mark} **as far as they can** [until we **push back**]{.mark}
in such a way that we **deter them** from taking **even more aggressive
action**]{.underline}."\[1\] [This Russian ambition and perspective is
the **disturbing reality** we now **confront**.]{.underline}

In contrast to this disturbing reality, [the possible **good
news**]{.underline} [is that]{.underline} the
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} regime--[[while **revisionist** and
**expansionist**]{.underline}]{.mark}---also [[appears]{.mark} to be
**pragmatic** and **[calculating]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These
characteristics are significant because [a potential opponent's
pragmatism, and related willingness to stand back following the
calculation of risk, are necessary for deterrence to operate to prevent
or defer aggression.]{.underline}

The good news here is that Russia appears not to be akin to National
Socialist Germany in this regard. Where contemporary Russia appears
pragmatic and calculating, Hitler had set expansionist goals and a
timeline, and his dedication to the realization of those goals was not
highly subject to pragmatism or the calculation of risk. Instead, Adolf
Hitler often boasted of his unalterable goals and unhesitating
decisions: "Neither threats nor warnings will prevent me from going my
way. I follow the path assigned me by Providence with the instinctive
sureness of a sleepwalker."\[2\] With such an adversary, effective
strategies of deterrence may be extremely difficult or even impossible.
But, that does not appear to be Russia.

This difference between contemporary Russia and National Socialist
Germany of the 1930's is critical. Where Russia sees opportunity and the
potential for expansion at tolerable risk and cost, it will likely act,
including with hard and soft power. However, where Russia's geographic
appetite is opposed by countervailing Western power, [Russia's behavior
will likely be limited by its pragmatism and related **willingness to
stand back** in the face of too much calculated risk and
cost.]{.underline}

I do not mean by this that Russia is likely to adopt amicable intentions
in response to Western power. While an amicable relationship is a
long-term goal, [deterrence is not about creating amicable intentions.
It is about preventing aggression in the context of less-than-amicable
relations]{.underline}. The combination of Russian pragmatism and risk
calculation suggests that in the face of countervailing Western power,
[there is room for Moscow to moderate its provocative pursuit of
revisionist goals. This is good news because it means that there is the
potential for Western power to deter extreme Russian
behavior]{.underline}, at least in principle.

A Nuclear Challenge

The key question that follows is: How are these apparent Russian
geopolitical aspirations and regime characteristics related to a Russian
nuclear challenge? A very concise answer is as follows: [**[Russia's
leadership]{.mark}** reportedly [believes]{.mark} that [Moscow can
use]{.mark} the threat of nuclear first-use, or **actual limited
[nuclear first-use]{.mark}** if necessary, [to]{.mark} help advance its
goal of **[revis]{.mark}ing [the political order]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in Eurasia.\[3\]

In short, [[there is a **link** between]{.mark} Russia's [**nuclear
capabilities** and its **expansionist goals**]{.mark} that includes two
mechanisms]{.underline}. First, [Moscow appears to believe that it can
use nuclear threats against U.S. allies and partners to move them away
from policies and positions Moscow opposes]{.underline}, and to compel
their conciliation in crises. This apparent coercive role for nuclear
threats is a return to Soviet Cold War practice.\[4\] It goes beyond
traditional Western notions of limiting the scope and purpose of nuclear
deterrence to the protection of a country's existence.

Rather, Russia appears to have lowered the threshold for making nuclear
threats to include preventing Western actions that seem to have little
to do with threats to Russia's survival; to put it differently, Russia
appears to have expanded the range of foreign behaviors it believes it
can influence via explicit nuclear threats.

For example, [Russia has made explicit nuclear threats to allies
regarding participation in the U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD)
program]{.underline}: In 2015, Russia's Ambassador to Denmark, Mikhail
Vanin, reportedly made an explicit nuclear targeting threat: "I don't
think that Danes fully understand the consequence if Denmark joins the
American-led missile defence shield. If they do, then Danish warships
will be targets for Russian nuclear missiles."\[5\]

The second linkage between Russia's geographic aspirations and nuclear
weapons is that [Moscow appears to believe that it can employ limited
nuclear strikes against U.S. allies and possibly against the U.S. itself
to prevent a cohesive, powerful Western response to Russia's use of hard
power in support of its **expansionist goals**.]{.underline} This is the
much-discussed Russian approach to "de-escalation." The underlying
concept appears to be that a conflict is de-escalated because Russia's
opponent decides to cease resistance in the face of limited Russian
nuclear use.

In 2015, NATO Deputy Military Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Adrian
Bradshaw, pointed out, "Russia might believe the large scale
conventional force it has shown it can generate on very short
notice...could in the future be used not only for intimidation and
coercion but potentially to seize NATO territory after which the threat
of escalation might be used to prevent reestablishment of territorial
integrity."\[6\] This apparent Russian notion again has little to do
with Russia using nuclear threat or escalation in the protection of its
existence; escalation here would be in the service of expansion.

I believe that [this combination of Russian expansionist goals and
nuclear concepts is the most obvious and immediate nuclear
challenge.]{.underline} The questions that arise from this combination
are: First, what is the basis for Russia's felt freedom to lower the
threshold for nuclear threats and potentially nuclear first-use? What
are the gaps, as perceived by Moscow, in the existing Western deterrence
position that allow this perceived freedom? And, second, how can the
West moderate Russian views about the potential value of nuclear threats
and nuclear first-use in support of its expansionist goals?

The short answer to this latter question is that the West must take
advantage of Russian pragmatism and risk calculation to move it away
from nuclear threats and any anticipation of success via nuclear first
use. What does this require in principle? [[The West must **move
Russia** to see]{.mark} that:]{.underline}

its frequent nuclear threats are counterproductive; and

[**[any level]{.underline}** [of nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} [first
[use would]{.mark} risk [unleash]{.mark}ing an **uncontrollable
process** with potentially **[intolerable consequences]{.mark}** for
Russia.]{.underline}

This does not mean that the West must adopt the apparent Russian view
that nuclear escalation is controllable. No, [it means that the West
must lead Russia to understand that: 1) it cannot fracture NATO cohesion
via nuclear threats; and 2) it would not be able to control nuclear
escalation to its advantage and success]{.underline}. Rather, such
escalation would always entail too much risk. Western nuclear deterrence
posturing and capabilities alone probably cannot produce [[this]{.mark}
change in Russian thinking]{.underline}, but it **[[cannot be
accomplished without nuclear deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

A Domestic Nuclear Challenge

At the outset of this discussion I suggested that there are two
different but related nuclear challenges. One external, the other
domestic. I have briefly described what I believe to be the most obvious
and immediate external nuclear challenge: It is the linkage between
Russian national aspirations and Moscow's apparent views regarding the
value of nuclear weapons in the pursuit of those aspirations. The
domestic challenge confronting us is whether there will be clear-eyed
recognition of these external nuclear threat developments, and the
corresponding establishment of an enduring and responsive deterrence
policy and posture. Throughout much of the Cold War, the United States
sustained a bipartisan deterrence policy and posture vis-à-vis the
Soviet Union. It was sufficiently effective to help bound U.S.-Soviet
hostilities throughout the Cold War.

Doing so again in this new post-Cold War era will cut against
considerable established thought: For almost three decades, the common
Western expectation has been that great power nuclear threats were a
thing of the past. That expectation led the United States and allies in
a very particular direction. This direction was generally based on the
underlying bipartisan presumption that nuclear deterrence and
capabilities were of sharply declining value, and that continually
reducing and limiting nuclear capabilities was synonymous with reducing
nuclear dangers. That is, the security value of continuing to reduce and
limit U.S. nuclear systems was deemed to be greater than the potential
value of continuing to modernize and replace those nuclear systems.

If you doubt my point, I encourage you to read or reread President
George H. W. Bush's landmark September 21, 1991 speech introducing the
Presidential Nuclear Initiative, and President Obama's landmark 2009
Prague speech in favor of nuclear disarmament. The common apparent
underlying current in each noted speech is the presumption that the
great power nuclear environment was moving in an increasingly benign
direction, would continue to do so, and that continuing reductions in
U.S. nuclear forces would reduce nuclear dangers rather than risk
endangering Western security.

There is this enduring strain in U.S. thinking about nuclear
capabilities--that they should continually be reduced because greater
safety is to be found in ever-lower numbers and greater limitations. [I
understand and would agree with that thought **in the right context**,
but not in the context of the deep U.S. nuclear reductions already made
and the emerging external nuclear challenges we now see.]{.underline}

Instead, [effective nuclear deterrence appears to be of increasing
value, and [U.S. nuclear capabilities again are needed to make
deterrence as **effective as possible**]{.mark} given the reality of
external nuclear challenges]{.underline}. That is,
[**[modernizing]{.mark}** U.S. [nuclear forces now]{.mark} in support of
deterrence [is **more likely to reduce nuclear dangers**]{.mark} than
would their **continuing reduction** at the possible expense of
sustaining effective deterrence capabilities.]{.underline}

[This does not mean that the United States needs to increase the number
of its strategic nuclear weapons]{.underline}, nor that future nuclear
reductions must be avoided. **[Rather]{.underline}**, [it means
recognizing that [sustaining **nuclear deterrence**]{.mark}, and the
needed nuclear posture for deterrence at **multiple levels**,
[is]{.mark} again [a **key** to addressing **emerging**]{.mark} external
**[nuclear dangers]{.mark}.**]{.underline} That recognition should
underlie how we think about these issues. [The related internal
challenge is whether the United States and key allies will be able to
**establish** and **sustain** the domestic political consensus necessary
for an enduring countervailing nuclear policy and posture designed to
help address the gaps that Russia apparently perceives in the West's
deterrence position]{.underline}. [These are the [gaps]{.mark} that
appear to [give Russia]{.mark}, according to its perceptions, [the
liberty to]{.mark}: 1) engage in **unprecedented coercive nuclear
threats**, and, 2) potentially [engage in]{.mark} **coercive [nuclear
first-use]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} "de-escalate" or [end a conflict on its
**favored terms**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

#### Evaluate this debate with the goal of making revolution -- the only role for intellectuals in the face of capitalism is to produce knowledge that informs revolutionary tactics -- any other role feeds back into the maintenance of capitalism by eschewing proletarian consciousness

Multitude of Possibilities: The Strategic Vision of Antonio Negri and
Michael Hardt," School of History and Politics and Sociology, 2010,

cVs)

[[Communism]{.underline}]{.mark} will remain associated with many of the
horrors of the twentieth century. Yet the term [is still used and
understood as a name for the continuing proletarian
revolution.]{.underline} A \'communist revival\' in the English speaking
academy has been indicated by the manifesto of students who occupied the
University of California, Santa Cruz last year (Communique from an
Absent Future: 2009) and the thousand participants in 2009 who paid to
attend the \'Idea of Communism\' conference at the University of London.
My use of the word \'communism\' is influenced and inspired by such
actions as well as by Hardt and Negri\'s commitment to struggle over the
meaning of words that have a powerful heritage and profound significance
to the proletariat. Of course, [the word [is]{.mark} often [linked to
previous]{.mark} or existing \'communist [states]{.mark}\' and
\'communist parties\'.]{.underline} However, I agree with Hardt and
Negri that [these states and parties are generally [manifestations of
state capitalism]{.mark} rather than of communism. The errors and
defeats of previous communist experiments and the dead hand of
capitalist forms of praxes calling themselves communist continue to
weigh heavily on the proletariat, making it difficult to speak of
communism without \'corpses in our mouths\'. **[Reclaiming]{.mark} and
speaking of [communism]{.mark} in a positive sense [recognises the
genuine communist heritage, which opposes authoritarianism, repression,
war]{.mark} and terror, [and illuminates]{.mark} its praxes of [freedom,
democracy, peace and love.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Communism has been
the enemy common to many neo-liberal, social democratic, fascist]{.mark}
and socialist [regimes]{.mark} and those identified as [communists have
been]{.mark} targeted and [murdered in their millions]{.mark} during the
global class war [to break proletarian power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today
these communist victims and the victims of \'communism\' \'haunt the
world\'. But communism is not a ghost, not even \"a positive ghost\"
(Negri in Casarino and Negri: 2008: 200), rather [communism is a
movement, or movement of movements, and is very much alive. It is this
living movement of movements that continues to threaten, challenge and
go beyond capital.]{.underline} When I began this thesis, the world was
at war and the people of the globe had been told: \"Either you are with
us or you are with the terrorists\" (Bush: 2003). As terror and fear
spread, there were growing threats to \'academic freedom\' and \'freedom
of speech\' from those backing the Bush administration\'s agenda. When
Negri was invited to speak at an academic conference in Sydney in 2005
he was publicly denounced as a terrorist in and by major media outlets
and the event was cancelled (see Chapter One). Just as Negri was dragged
in I977 from the academy in a previous \'state of emergency\', to rot in
jail under preventative detention for alleged terrorist activity, in the
current global \'war on terror\' others have fallen victim to a
continuous \'strategy of tension\'. Dr Andrej Holm and Dr Matthias B
were arrested in Berlin in 2007 under anti-terrorist laws and alleged by
police to have written, in academic publications, \'phrases and key
words\' also used by a militant group and of being intellectually
capable of authoring the group\'s \'sophisticated texts\'. Liliany
Oblando, a Colombian sociologist, was charged in 2008 with \'rebellion\'
and \'managing resources related to terrorist activities\' while
investigating right-wing death squads. [Both within the academy and
outside it, [this is a dangerous time to]{.mark} choose the latter
option of \'either with us or against us\' and to [challenge those who
seek to]{.mark} silence dissent, [curtail critical debate]{.mark} and
label opponents of capital, war and repression as \'traitors\' and
\'terrorists\', [while they defend an]{.mark} established [order that
is]{.mark} in fact [terroristic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hardt and Negri
(2004: 33) assert that today [\"the majority of political scientists are
merely technicians working to resolve the quantative problems of
maintaining order, and the rest wander the corridors from their
universities to the courts of power]{.underline}, attempting to get the
ear of the sovereign and whisper advice\"- Negri has also argued that
\"it is more interesting and more useful to make revolution than to
write about it\" (quoted in Hardt: 2005b: 29). Yet Hardt and Negri
(2009: 127) are interested in the kind of [[academic strategic
investigations]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[have \"been forged by]{.mark}
professors and [students who take their work outside the
universities]{.mark} both to put their expertise at the service of the
social movements and to enrich their research by [learning from the
movements]{.mark} and participating in the production of knowledge
developed there\".]{.underline} In order to learn from proletarian
theory and practice, throughout this thesis I provide in-depth analysis
of Hardt and Negri\'s writings and discussions about real world
politics, while testing their ideas out on various case studies. The
thesis maps the development of Hardt and Negri\'s thought by offering a
[historical analysis]{.underline} that [locates]{.underline} their
[writings in relation to class struggle a]{.underline}nd provides
contextual analyses of their key ideas. **[[To avoid becoming fixated on
the power of capital requires a focus on how the proletariat\'s agency
is a constituent element of social processes.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Helping me to resist becoming a technician of social order or an adviser
to the sovereign, I embark on this project as an active militant
involved in class struggle. Since \"it is not feasible to keep the
values that a researcher holds totally in check\", Bryman (2004: 21)
argues that [[a researcher\'s politics will influence]{.mark} a whole
variety of [presuppositions that in turn have implications for the
conduct of the research.]{.mark}]{.underline} Accordingly, Mies (1993:
68) advocates a \"conscious partiality\" in conducting research, while
Mitropoulos and Neilson (2005) argue against \"the apparently objective
space of an ivory tower-whose recourse to a de-politicisation of
knowledge marks the concealment of a politics\". [Proletarian politics
is compelled to an incessant process of polemic, critique and
intervention in social relations]{.underline} (Thobum: 2002: 453) [and
my politics have, to a certain extent, determined and will determine, my
choice of research areas, choice of method, the analysis and
interpretation of data and the conclusions of the thesis.]{.underline}
My work is strongly inï¬‚uenced by my values, beliefs, experiences and
the methodological assumption that the proletariat must free itself by
[collectively [breaking with capital]{.mark}]{.underline}- Assisting
this process, I believe[, [requires]{.underline}]{.mark} [a mode of
[enquiry that promotes proletarian subjectivities]{.mark}]{.underline},
constructed on the multitude\'s movements of self-valorisation. [The
role of the communist intellectual is to embark \"on the project of
co-research aimed at making the multitude. [The intellectual is thus not
\'out in front\' to determine the movements of history or \'on the
sidelines\' to critique them but rather completely \'inside\"\' where
strategic investigation can be \"a form of
militancy]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri: 2009: H8, 125).
Marx\'s conception of proletarian praxis, that is the relation of theory
and practice, explains how change comes about as people act and learn by
taking action. \"Struggles are the great teachers\" about social
developments, the \"engines of revolutionary theory\" (Negri: 2005b:
xiii) and Hardt and Negri (2009: I28) advocate the \"strategic
production of knowledge\" through a variety of routes as an \"active
engagement with the production of subjectivity in order to transform
reality, which ultimately involves the production of new truths\". They
use the ideas of Raniero Panzieri and Cornelius Castoriadis (in Hardt
and Negri: 2009: 24) to explain that \"although Marxism is born as
sociology, [the fundamental task is to translate that sociological
perspective into not just political science but really the science of
revolution\" and \"revolutionary research constantly has to follow and
be redefined by the forms of social movements\".]{.underline} Following
this advice, I look to the social movements of the multitude, to a wide
variety of praxis as well as to theory, to understand Hardt and Negri\'s
strategic vision, interweaving communist hypotheses with the
proletariat\'s multitudinous struggles.

### Sparks

#### [Exclusion DA]{.underline} -- Procedural rules of the game are [used to exclude minorities]{.underline} -- Their interp only replicated these violent logics

**Sparks 3** (Holloway Sparks, "Queens, Teens, and Model Mothers Race,
Gender, and the Discourse of Welfare Reform", The University of Michigan
Press, 2003)

In spite of the participatory principles embodied in these theories some
deliberative democrats have given inadequate attention to the bar public
sphere participation confronted by marginalized citizens. [Activists,
dissidents, racial and ethnic [minorities]{.mark}, and particularly poor
citizens [are regularly excluded from]{.mark} both
[decision-making]{.mark} and deliberative
[venues]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but this problem is often
sidestepped in the mainstream theoretical literature by theorists who
downplay the effects of social and economic inequality on public
participation (see, e.g., Barber 198.g Cohen 109; Dryzek 1990). The
claim that we can effectively bracket inequality in the public sphere,
however, has been strongly criticized recently by a group of theorists
explicitly concerned with problems of democratic inclusion. These
scholars, including James Bohman (2996), Nancy Fraser (1997), Jane
Mansbridge (1991, 1999), and his Young (2993, 1996, woo), have
emphasized the fact that [formal political equality does not guarantee
equal authority in or even access to the public realm]{.underline}. Iris
Young, for example, has identified [two forms of exclusion that prevent
citizens from fully participating in democracies]{.underline}. What she
calls [external exclusion "names the many ways that [individuals and
groups that ought to be included are purposely or inadvertently
left]{.mark} out of fora for discussion and
decision-making\"]{.underline} (zoo, 93-54). External exclusion [can be
as blatant as deliberately failing to invite certain groups to important
meetings, or can take more subtle forms such as the way economic
inequalities affect access to pofiti®1 institutions]{.underline}. As
Nancy Fraser has noted, in societies like the United States in which the
publication and circulation of political views depends on media
organizations that are privately owned and operated for profit, [[those
citizens]{.mark} who lack wealth will also generally "[lack access to
the material means of equal participation]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (1997,
79). This criticism has obvious salience for families living on welfare
budget. On a more basic level, money and time are also necessary for
participation in putatively "free\" political institutions. Poor parents
with young children, for example, might not have the resources to
purchase child-care in order to attend a town council meeting, at which
important political decisions are made[. [Internal exclusions]{.mark},
in contrast, "concern ways that [people lack effective
opportunity]{.mark} to influence the thinking of others even when they
have access to form and procedures of decision-making°]{.underline}
(Young z000, 55; emphasis added). Citizens may find that [\"[others
ignore]{.underline}]{.mark} [or dismiss or patronize their
[statements]{.mark} and expressions]{.underline}. Though formally
included in a forum or process, people may find that [their claims are
not taken seriously and may believe that they are not treated with equal
respect]{.underline}° (55). Internal exclusion can take the form of
public ridicule or face-to-face inattention (Bickford 1990, but it can
also stem from Lis obvious sources, such as the norms of articulateness,
dispassionateness, and orderliness that are often privileged in
political discussions (Young z000, 56). As Young observes, any formal
situations the better-educated [white middle-class people \... often act
as though they have a right to speak and that their words any
authority]{.underline}, [whereas those of [other groups often feel
intimidated by the argument requirements]{.mark} and the formality [and
rules]{.mark} of parliamentary procedure, [so they do not speak, or
speak only in a way that those in charge find
\'disruptive.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} \... The [dominant groups,
moreover, often fail entirely to notice this devaluation and silencing,
while the lets privileged often feel put down]{.underline} or
frustrated, either losing confidence in themselves angry. (r996,,) Since
["unruly" forms of speech tend to be used primarily by women, racial
minorities, and working-class people, large groups of citizens faze the
devaluation of their political participation.]{.underline}

### King 

#### The alt's autonomous experiment allows for co-option by the state -- antagonism can't solve 

**King, 16**---has been active in campaigning for refugee rights and
against border controls for over a decade, has taught at the University
of Nottingham and worked as a caseworker with the British Refugee
Council (Natasha, *No Borders: The Politics of Immigration Control and
Resistance* pg 39-42, dml)

But [to what extent [are]{.mark}]{.underline} these [experiments in
[autonomy **ever**]{.mark} **entirely
[autonomous]{.mark}**?]{.underline} In response to Richard Day's book on
the newest social movements, Richard Thompson argues that [it's
[**unrealistic** to talk]{.mark} [about]{.mark} creating **[wholly
autonomous social structures]{.mark}** because '\[t\]he **[second
they're consequential]{.mark}** is the **second [they'll be
noticed]{.mark}** \[by the state\]. At that point, it becomes
[**impossible** to break]{.mark} the cycle of [antagonism **by
will**]{.mark} **alone**. They will come after us']{.underline}
(Thompson n.d., emphasis added). In other words, [experiments in
[autonomy]{.mark} are **[rarely]{.mark}** (if **ever**) **entirely
[free]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a relation to the state]{.underline}, or
from state antagonism, [and we are **rarely able to [ignore that
antagonism]{.mark}**. [We]{.mark} may **[antagonize]{.mark} the
[state]{.mark}**, but we are **forced also to respond to the state**, as
a form of **self-defence**. This has happened **time** and **time
again**, from the **[steady illegalization of squatting]{.mark}** in
Europe, and the **[tightening of laws around private property]{.mark}**,
to the **[infiltration by]{.mark} the [CIA of]{.mark} the [Black
Panther]{.mark} movement**, to the **struggle between the
[Zapatistas]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[Mexican
state]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We see this in the struggle for the
freedom of movement when, continuing with the examples above, the EU
employs Frontex special missions on the Turkish/Greek borders, or when
the living spaces of people without papers are raided or destroyed.

[Whether people have been **forced to**, or they have **seen it as the
best strategy**, the **history of [struggles for liberation]{.mark}**
has]{.underline} been one that [**[included demands on]{.mark} the
[state]{.mark}**. Often this has taken the [form of **engagement
in**]{.mark} **a [politics]{.mark} of rights** and/or
**recognition**]{.underline}. From the movement of the Sans Papiers in
France, to 'a Day without Migrants' in the USA; [from campaigns that
fight against the detention and deportation of people without papers, to
struggles against police violence, [resistance through]{.mark} forms of
**[visible]{.mark} collective [action]{.mark}** have been
**[central]{.mark} [to struggles against]{.mark} the [border]{.mark}**.
In most cases such struggles have **made demands on the state**,
particularly through **seeking recognition as a group**, and through
**making claims to rights**]{.underline}. But to what extent are demands
for rights and/or recognition part of a no borders politics?

Demands for rights and recognition have played a big part in the
struggle for the freedom of movement. Yet there has been a long history
of criticism over [the politics of citizenship]{.underline}. Rights
claims, for example, [have been seen as **essentially reinforcing the
role of the state** as the benefactor and grantor of rights, and
**reinforcing the notion** that rights represent entitlements applicable
to those who **fit certain descriptions** of being a human]{.underline}
(cf. Arendt 1973 \[1951\]; Barbagallo and Beuret 2008; Bojadžijev and
Karakayali 2010; Elam 1994). [From this perspective]{.underline},
demands for rights and representation amount to disputes over the
allocation of equality and therefore can only ever achieve a
redistribution of that equality, rather than undermining the idea that
equality is somehow qualified in the first place. As Imogen Tyler says,
'[\[c\]itizenship is a **famously exclusionary concept**, and its
exclusionary force is **there by design**. The exclusions of citizenship
are **immanent to its logic**, and **not at all accidental**.
Citizenship is meant to **produce successful** and **unsuccessful
subjects**. Citizenship, in other words, is "**designed to
fail**"]{.underline}' (Tyler, quoted in Nyers 2015: 31).

Similar variations of this critique have appeared in the autonomy of
migration debate. [Representation can also be thought of as a
**bordering technology** that seeks to **pacify** and **discipline
expressions of autonomy**]{.underline} (or attempts at escape)
(Papadopoulos et al. 2008). [In other words, the politics of citizenship
is **problematic** because it **only ever brings people into the
state**]{.underline}. 'Of course migrants become stronger when they
become visible by obtaining rights, but the demands of migrants and the
dynamics of migration cannot be exhausted in the quest for visibility
and rights' (ibid.: 219).

[I have]{.underline} a lot of **[sympathy with these
arguments]{.underline}**, and because of them am extremely suspicious of
a politics of citizenship. [But when it comes to **actual practices of

against such strategies seems [**naïve**, and **insulting to**]{.mark}
**[those who]{.mark} have [take]{.mark}n [part]{.mark}**. Migrant-led
struggles **have often been claims for rights**, and]{.underline}
ultimately [I **don't want to dismiss such practices** because they are
**philosophically problematic**]{.underline}. In fact,
[[sometimes]{.mark} to appeal to rights or recognition is the [**only
available strategy** in]{.mark} situations of **[extreme
vulnerability]{.mark}**, where people's options are **highly limited**.
[Recognizing]{.mark} that we are **in [relations of power]{.mark} right
now** means also recognizing that our [situation is
**imperfect**]{.mark} and that we [have]{.mark} [to **struggle
in**]{.mark} **our (imperfect) [reality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Youssef,
a long-time activist for the freedom of movement in Greece, himself of
North African descent, talked about the need for pragmatism in tactics;
that [sometimes [we **must engage**]{.mark} **[with]{.mark} the
[state]{.mark}** in order [to **bring**]{.mark} **about greater
[freedoms]{.mark} now**]{.underline}. 'Today, in Creta, in Chania, they
will catch five people. How can I take them from the jail? I have
something in the police station, OK. I have to talk with them today. OK?
But tomorrow I can fuck him. He's not my friend. He's not my comrade.
OK. We are talking today. Tomorrow we are fucking' (interview, Youssef).
His statement reflects how many practices that refuse the border often
come out of necessity. In other words they're rarely part of some
intentional or 'noble' act to become a rights-bearer, say, and more
often pragmatic decisions based on the need to alleviate immediate
situations of oppression.

[A no borders politics seeks to **go beyond claims** to representation
and rights that **[ultimately]{.mark} stand to [reinforce]{.mark} the
[state]{.mark}**. But claims to representation and rights **can
sometimes do this too**]{.underline}. Building on Foucault's idea that
[power can be both **positive** and **empowering** or **negative** and
**dominating**]{.underline}, Biddy Martin and Chandra Mohanty suggest
that [[fighting oppression]{.mark} [involves]{.mark} seeing power in a
way that **refuses totalizing visions** of it and can therefore account
for the possibility of resistance]{.underline}, as in creating something
new, **[within [existing power relations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Martin
and Mohanty 2003: 104). [Suggesting that representation **only ever
brings people into power**]{.underline} therefore [[means
**rejecting**]{.mark} **a vast range of [moments]{.mark}** when the
oppressed have **voiced their refusal to be reduced to non-beings**
outside of politics]{.underline} (Sharma 2009: 475). In other words,
resistance is not only or always a reaction to the constraining effects
of dominating power, but can also express power as something positive
and liberating. [From the **Black Panthers** to the **Sans Papiers**,
demands for representation]{.underline}, when carried out by minority
groups for themselves, [can **[challenge]{.mark} the role of [dominant
power]{.mark}** over that group and **create new**, **emancipated
subjectivities**]{.underline} (Goldberg 1996; Malik 1996). Depending on
who it is that acts, then, [in some cases demands for recognition/rights
can be a **radical** and **transformative political act**]{.underline}
(Nyers 2015. See also Butler and Spivak 2007; Isin 2008; Nyers and
Rygiel 2012). As Nandita Sharma suggests, in response to Papadopoulos et
al.'s book Escape Routes,

we must recognise that making life and fashioning our subjectivities are
intimately intertwined and making 'new social bodies' ... is not the
same as bringing people back into power through identity politics (or
identity policing). It is important to recognise that there are
significant qualitative differences between subjectivities. There are
those that Papadopoulos et al. rightly discuss as bringing us directly
back into power -- and which account for most of the subjectivities that
people hold today ('race', 'nation', 'heterosexual', 'homosexual',
'native' and so on) -- but there are also those that are born of
practices of escape. (Sharma 2009: 473, emphasis in original)

### Tinsley 

#### The aff's ignorance of queerness' intricate relation to the Middle Passage is not neutral- it originates in a desire to structurally remove discussions of queer bodies from historical interrogations- this is not a link of omission, but rather a complete relegation of erotic desire to the margins of our discourse

**Tinsley 8** \[2008, Omise'eke Tinsley is Professor of English and

And water, [ocean water is the first thing in the unstable confluence of
race. nationality. sexuality. and gender]{.underline} I want to imagine
here. [This wateriness is meta- phor, and history too. The
brown-skinned, fluid-bodied experiences now called blackness and
queerness surfaced in intercontinental. maritime contacts hundreds of
years ago: in the seventeenth century, in the Atlantic
Oce]{.underline}an. You see, **[the black Atlantic has always been the
queer Atlantic]{.underline}**. What Paul Gilroy never told us is how
[queer relationships were forged on merchant and pirate ships, where
Europeans and Africans slept with fellow\--and I mean
same-sex\--sailors]{.underline}. And, more powerfully and silently, how
[**queer relationships emerged in the holds of slave ships** that
crossed between West Africa and the Caribbean archipelago]{.underline}.
I began to learn this black Atlantic when l was studying relationships
between women in Suriname and delved into the etymology of the word
mati. This is the word Creole women use for their female lovers:
figuratively mi mati is \"my girl,\" but literally it means mate, as in
shipmate-she who survived the Middle Passage with me. Sed- imented
layers of experience lodge in this small word. [During the Middle
Passage]{.underline}, as colonial chronicles, oral tradition, and
anthropological studies tell us, [captive African women created erotic
bonds with other women in the sex-segregated holds, and captive African
men created bonds with other men. In so doing, they resisted the
commodification of their bought and sold bodies by feeling and feeling
for their co-occupants on these ships]{.underline}. l [evoke this
history now not to claim the slave ship as the origin of the black queer
Atlantic. The ocean obscures all origins, and neither ship nor Atlantic:
can be a place of origin]{.underline}. Not of blackness, though perhaps
Africans first became negro: and negers during involuntary sea
transport; not of queerness, though per- haps some Africans were first
intimate with same-sex shipmates then. Instead[, in relationship to
blackness, queerness, and black queerness, the Atlantic is the site of
what the anthropologist Kale Fajardo calls
\"crosscurrents]{.underline}.\" [Oceans and are important sites for
differently situated people]{.underline}. Indig- enous Peoples,
fisherpeople, seafarers, sailors, tourists, workers, and ath- letes.
[Oceans and seas are sites of inequality and exploitation-resource
extraction, pollution, militarization, atomic testing, and genocide. At
the same time, oceans and seas are sites of beauty and
pleasure\--solitude, sensuality, desire, and resistance. **Oceanic and
maritime realms are also spaces of transnational and diasporic
communities, heterogeneous trajectories of globalizations, and other
racial, gender, class, and sexual formations.\'**]{.underline}
Conceptualizing the complex possibilities and power dynamics of the
maritime, Fajardo posits the [**necessity of thinking through
transoceanic cross-currents.** are theoretical and ethnographic
borderlands at sea, where elements or currents of historical,
conceptual, and embodied maritime experience come together to transform
racialized, gendered, classed, and sexualized selves. The queer black
Atlantic]{.underline} I discuss here [navigates these cross-currents as
it brings together enslaved and African, brutality and desire, genocide
and resistance]{.underline}. Here, fluidity is not an easy metaphor for
queer and racially hybrid identities but for concrete, painful, and
liberatory experience. It is the kind of queer of color space that
Roderick Fer- guson calls for in Aberration: in Black. one that reflects
the materiality of black queer experience while refusing its
transparency.\' If the black queer Atlantic brings together such
long-flowing history. why is black queer studies situated as a
dazzlingly new \"discovery\" in academia-a hybrid, mermaidlike
imagination that has yet to find its land legs? In the last five years,
black queer and queer of color critiques have navigated innovative
direc- tions in African diaspora studies as scholars like Ferguson and
E. Patrick Johnson push the discipline to map intersections between
racialized and sexualized bod- ies. Unfortunately, [Eurocentric queer
theorists and heterocentric race theorists have engaged their discourses
of resistant black queerness as a new fashion]{.underline}\-- a glitzy,
postmodern invention borrowed and adapted from Euro-American queer
theory. [In contrast]{.underline}, as interventions like the New-York
Historical Society\'s exhibit Slavery in New York demonstrate, [the
Middle Passage and slave experience con- tinue to be evoked as authentic
originary sites of African diaspora identities and
discourses]{.underline}.3 [This stark split the \"newest\" and
\"oldest\" sites of blackness reflects larger political trends that
polarize queer versus diasporic and immigrant issues by moralizing and
domesticating sexuality as an undermining of tradition, on the one hand,
while racializing and publicizing global southern diasporas as threats
to the integrity of a nation of (fictively) European immigrants, on the
other]{.underline}. My discussion here [purposes to intervene in this
polarization by bridging imagina- tions of the \"choice\" of black
queerness and the forced migration of the Middle Passage]{.underline}.
What would it mean for both queer and African diaspora studies to take
seriously the possibility that. as forcefully as the Atlantic and
Caribbean flow together. so too do the turbulent fluidities of blackness
and queerness? What new geography \--or as Fajardo proposes,
oceanography\--of sexual, gendered. trans- national, and racial
identities might through reading for black queer his- tory aml theory in
the traumatic dislocation of the Middle Passage?\' u..- ln what follows,
I [explore such queer Atlantic oceanographies by comparing two narrative
spaces. One is a site where an imagination of this Atlan- tic struggles
to emerge]{.underline}: in academic theorizing, specifically in water
metaphors of African diaspora and queer theory[. The second is a site
where such imagina- tions emerge through struggle]{.underline}: in
Caribbean creative writing, specifically in Ana- Maurine Lara\'s tale of
queer migration in Erzulie\'s Skirt (2006) and Dionne Brand\'s
reflections on the Middle Passage in A Map to the Door of No Return
(2(l0l). I turn to these literary texts as a queer, unconventional, and
imaginative archive of the black Atlantic.5 And the literary texts turn
to ocean waters themselves as an archive, an ever-present,
ever-reformulating record of the unimaginable. Lara and Brand plumb the
archival ocean materially, as space that churns with physi- cal
remnants. dis(re)membered bodies of the Middle Passage, and they plumb
it metaphorically, as opaque space to convey the drowned, disremembered,
ebbing and flowing histories of violence and healing in the African
diaspora. \"Water over- flows with memory,\" writes M. Jacqui Alexander,
delving into the Middle Passage in Pedagogies of Crossing. \"Emotional
memory. Bodily memory. Sacred memory.\"\" [Developing a black feminist
epistemology to uncover submerged historic-s- particularly those stories
of Africans\' forced ocean crossings that traditional his- toriography
cannot validate]{.underline}-AIexander eloquently argues that searchers
must explore outside narrow conceptions of the \"factual\" to get there.
[Such explorations would involve muddying divisions between documented
and intuited, material and metaphoric, past and present so that \"who is
remembered-and how-is contin- ually being transformed through a web of
interpretive systems . . . collapsing. ulti- mately, the demarcation of
the prescriptive past, present. and future of linear
time]{.underline}.\"7 While Alexander searches out such crossings in
Afro-Atlantic ceremony. Lara and Brand explore similarly fluid
embodied-imaginary, historical-contemporary spaces through the literal
and figurative passages of their historical fictions. The subaltern can
in submarine space, but it is hard to hear her or his underwa- ter
voice, whispering (as Brand writes) a thousand secrets that at once wash
closer and remain opaque, resisting closure.

### Warren

#### Momentary unfairness is good

**Waren 11 **(Warren Waren University of Central Florida, Orlando,
"Using Monopoly to Introduce Concepts of Race and Ethnic Relations," The
Journal of Effective Teaching, Vol. 11, No. 1, 2011, 28-35,
<https://www.uncw.edu/jet/articles/Vol11_1/Waren.pdf> ) //ZoL

Undergraduate [**[students]{.mark}**]{.underline} often enter our
classrooms convinced that the battles of the Civil Rights Era solved the
issue of race in America. They are generally unacquainted with the long
history of race in the United States and almost universally
[**underestimate the** **[structural forces which carry]{.mark} racial
[disparities]{.mark}**]{.underline} into their new century. As
sociologists and teachers, it is our responsibility to tell that story
and explain those forces. Our new challenge is: How do we teach students
the extent of racism in America when, from their point of view, the
problem of the color-line has been solved? One option is to use a game.
Sociologists have used games or simulations to spark the sociological
imagination (Dorn, 1989; Jessup, 2001; Fisher 2008), to stimulate
critical thinking (Pence 2009), and to introduce social stratification
(Ender, 2004; Waldner & Kinney, 1999). [**[When students from relatively
privileged backgrounds "experience" a temporary bout of
unfairness]{.mark} [in a]{.mark}** simulated **[game]{.mark}**, [it
creates the opportunity to change]{.mark} their
[perspective]{.mark}]{.underline} (Coghlan & Huggins, 2004; Haddad &
Lieberman, 2002). [[The injustice of the situation, if directly
connected to broader theory, can lessen a student's social distance from
marginalized groups]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A game may help a student to
understand some of the previously inexplicable attitudes and behaviors
of actors on either side of a power relationship]{.underline}. Also, as
this paper demonstrates, a properly constructed simulation can give the
student a sense of the structural nature and lasting legacy of racial
discrimination---a fuller sense of the "history and biography" of race
in the United States (Mills, 1959). The great advantage of a game is
that it is a completely controlled environment---there are no
unexplained variables. In fairness to all the players, all rules are
explicitly stated at the outset of game play and apply to all players
equally (Waldner & Kinney, 1999). [Ordinarily, in a competitive game
this assumption of fairness supports an ideology of
individualism]{.underline}. However, [a pedagogical game is concerned
with learning, not winning]{.underline}. In order to disentangle a
complicated issue, the instructor may purposefully introduce inequality
into an otherwise "just" world. Again, because all rules are explicit
(even unfair ones), the problem exists in the game without confounding
effects. This simplification allows students to easily focus on the
nature and development of the problem. By extension, it is hoped that
the game encourages students to reassess similar problems in the real
world. Use of Pedagogical Games Dorn (1989) identifies multiple criteria
for games or simulations to be effective in the classroom as pedagogical
tools. He argues the games must: reflect reality; motivate students
through \"experience\"; develop awareness of personal values through
moral and ethical implications of the game; connect abstract concepts
with concrete experiences; create a shared experience from which the
students can draw; offer a form of debriefing to both address emotional
issues and to connect theory to experiences. In the technique I describe
below, I try to incorporate these ideas with Straus' (1986) emphasis on
simplicity for in-class games. In teaching and learning, the goal of
simulation is the "experience" itself. Jessup (2001) argues that
simulation should be the "experiential anchor for the elaboration of
conceptual tools" (p.108). Therefore, [[**this game** is]{.mark} created
to offer [a chance for relatively privileged students to experience the
unfairness of structural inequality.]{.mark}]{.underline} After
temporary exposure to an analog of racial discrimination, students with
no prior familiarity of racial discrimination will have a deeper
understanding of the effects of racism on many levels. Pedagogical games
are used to challenge our assumptions about how the world works (Waldner
& Kinney, 1999). [For example, [the basic assumption of]{.mark}
**competitive** [games is **fairness**]{.mark}. This [assumes that the
world is fair]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., a meritocracy) and that
individual effort or talent is the main factor in success (i.e., an
ideology of individualism akin to Ross' (1977) fundamental attribution
error). In competitive games therefore, groups are treated equally and
the best players win. [But a pedagogical game may challenge the
assumption of fairness directly by having structural inequality built
into the game. **[The experience of a good player losing an unfair game
creates cognitive dissonance---that]{.mark}** cognitive dissonance **[is
our teaching moment.]{.mark}**]{.underline} I assume that students as
game players can easily identify games that are "unfair" based on
unequal outcomes for equivalent behavior. As a pedagogical tool, I want
it to be relatively easy for them to spot the explicit rules which cause
the inequality.

#### Queer use turns the resolution 

**Ahmed 18** (Sara Ahmed, "Queer Use," Lecture presented at LGBTQ+@cam,
Cambridge, November 7, 2018,
<https://feministkilljoys.com/2018/11/08/queer-use/> ) //ZoL

\*\*Pictures, poems and their respective descriptions have been
omitted\*\*

**[The demand to use something properly is a demand to revere what has
been given by the colonizer]{.underline}**. Empire as gift comes with
use instructions. [If not to be subjected to the will of the colonizer
is to queer use or even to become queer through misuse]{.underline}
(perversion as self-revelation), **[to queer use is to live in proximity
to violence]{.underline}**. [To queer use is to linger on the material
qualities of that which you are supposed to pass over; it is to recover
a potential from materials that have been left behind, all the things
you can do with paper if you refuse the instructions]{.underline}. That
recovery can be dangerous. The creativity of queer use becomes an act of
destruction, whether intended or not; not digesting something, spitting
it out; putting it about. Queer use in other words can be understood as
vandalism: "the willful destruction of what is venerable and beautiful."
Earlier I described diversity workers as institutional plumbers. We
might from this description assume that diversity workers are appointed
to unblock the system. But a blockage can be how the system is working.
The system is working by stopping those are trying to transform the
system. [This means that: to transform a system we have to stop the
system from working. When you stop the machine from working, you damage
the machine]{.underline}. The plumber might need to be a vandal, or we
might have to pass as a plumber (fixing the leak) to become a vandal
(making it bigger). [We might have to throw a wrench in the works or
become, to use Sarah Franklin's (2015) terms "wenches in the works,"
throw our bodies into the system trying to stop the same old bodies from
being assembled, doing the same old things]{.underline}. [The "wench in
the works" has a queer kinship with the feminist killjoy, a kinship of
figures can be a kinship of persons, as non-reproductive agents; those
who are trying to stop what usually happens from happening.]{.underline}
**[We might need to become quite willing to become an obstruction.
Protest too is framed as vandalism: not only as damage to property but
as motivated by a desire to cause damage.]{.underline}** We can become
obstructions by virtue of existing or by questioning the virtue of an
existence. Even to open up a question about how to live, how to love,
can be framed as damage. Queer as snap, snap: as if you are cutting up
the family with a pair of scissors just by arranging your life in a
different way. Not following something as destroying something: no
wonder they find us to be destructive. So much is reproduced by the
requirement to follow. [Within the academy you might be asked to follow
the well-trodden paths of citation; to cite properly as to cite those
deemed to have already the most influence. The more a path is used the
more a path is used.]{.underline} A path is kept clear through work;
occupation depends upon erasure; such and such white man might become an
originator of a concept, an idea as becoming seminal, by removing traces
of those who were here before. Indigenous feminists, black feminists and
feminists of colour have crafted new routes by what or who we refuse to
let disappear: I think of work by Zoe Todd (2016), Eve Tuck (2018) and
Alexis Pauline Gumbs (2016). **[Speaking of whiteness in the academy or
of colonialism as the context in which Enlightenment philosophy happened
is to bring up the scandal of the vandal]{.underline}**. Decolonizing
the curriculum as a project has been framed as an act of vandalism, a
willful destruction of our universals; knocking off the heads of
statues, snapping at the thrones of the philosopher kings. [If throwing
open the question of how to live or who to read is deemed damaging, we
are willing to cause damage, to turn that judgement into a
project]{.underline}. And [vandalism becomes a tactic when we have to
cut a message off from a body, when a message if traced to a source
would compromise the source]{.underline}. If organisations try and
contain what would damage their reputation, we find other ways to get
information out. We might need to use guerrilla tactics, and we have a
feminist and queer histories to draw upon; write names of harassers on
books or on walls. What is treated as damage can be a message sent out:
we can reach each other through what seems mere scratch and scribble.
The requirement to be inventive is not just a matter of communication.
Audre Lorde in her poem "A Litany for Survival" evokes "those of us,"
who "love in doorways coming and going in the hours between dawns"
(1988: 31). You might have to use the less used paths, turn a doorway
into a meeting place; you might have to try to slide by undetected
because being seen is dangerous when you are seen as dangerous. Queer
use can be a matter of survival, becoming fainter as your best chance of
being at all. And so: **[there are queer possibilities not only in use,
how materials can be picked up when we refuse an instruction, but in not
being of use]{.underline}**. A much used book might give us a glimpse of
other fainter trails. There is a discussion in Origins of vestigial
organs, as parts that are no longer useful but linger however dwindled
such as the small eye of the blind mole; these parts are sometimes
called left overs. Vestigiality is the retention of structures or
attributes of ancestral species that have lost their functionality;
another version of the strange temporality of use. Let me quote from
Origins: "Rudimentary parts, as it is generally admitted, are apt to be
highly variable... their variability seems to result from their
uselessness, and consequently from natural selection having had no power
to check deviations in their structure" (\[1859\] 2009, 118-9, my
emphasis). [Uselessness]{.underline}: it [can be a deadly
assignment]{.underline}. I think we know this, a history of whom and
what is discarded, how the fragments are swept up and away. **[We can
pick up these pieces. We can find other ways of telling the history of
use and uselessness, hearing a queer potential]{.underline}** in a
sentence from a much-used book. [That potential: not being selected is
not to be checked; to have more room to roam, to vary, to deviate; to
proliferate]{.underline}. **[If queer use can be about survival,
followed the less well used path in order not to be detected, queer use
can also be about creativity, the variations that are possible when you
are not selected or rewarded for going the right way]{.underline}**.
But: not being selected can also mean not being supported. And so: **[we
create our own support systems, queer handles; how we hold on; how a
life can go on, when we are shattered, because we are shattered. No
wonder then: the stories of the exhaustion of inhabiting worlds that do
not accommodate us, the stories of the weary and the worn, the teary and
the torn, are the same stories as the stories of inventiveness, of
creating something, of making something.]{.underline}** I think of
Lorde. I always think of Lorde. Audre Lorde spoke of herself as a writer
when she was dying. She wrote: "I am going to write fire until it comes
out of my ears, my eyes, my noseholes--everywhere. Until it's every
breath I breathe. I'm going to go out like a fucking meteor!" (1978:
76-77). She goes out, she makes something. She calls this capacity to
make things through heat "the erotic." Lorde describes : "There is a
difference between painting a black fence and writing a poem, but only
one of quantity. And there is, for me, no difference between writing a
good poem and moving into sunlight against the body of a woman I love"
(1984: 58). Words flicker with life, like sunlight on her body. We can
break open a container to make things. We watch the words spill. They
spill all over you. I think too of Cherrie Moraga's poem "The Welder."
Moraga speaks of heat being used to shape new elements, to create "the
intimacy of steel melting, the fire that makes sculpture of your lives,
builds buildings" (1981: 219). We have to build our own buildings, when
the world does not accommodate our desires. When you are blocked, when
your very existence is prohibited or viewed with general suspicion or
even just raised eyebrows (yes they are pedagogy), you have to come up
with your own systems for getting things through. Can this be a queer
inheritance; how we inherit from past struggles to exist; small
modifications, the widening of a passageway or an opening just enough to
enable more to get by or to get through; a sociability as worn as
wisdom, secret passages, meeting places, shelters, passing information
down a line about where to go, what to do? So much can happen from a
struggle to be, from the friction of being rubbed up the wrong way;
inversions, beaks that end up the wrong way up, what we cobble together
out of necessity from parts at hand. [It teaches us that it is possible
for those deemed strangers to take up residence in spaces that have been
assumed as belonging to others]{.underline}. The post-box could have
remained in use; the nest destroyed before it was completed; the birds
displaced. [A history of use is a history of such displacements, many
violent, displacements that are often unrecognised because of how things
remain occupied]{.underline}. [It is because of this occupation, this
settling of history, this weight; **that queer use requires more than an
act of affirming the queerness of use. Queer use is the work we have to
do to queer use**]{.underline}.**[Queer use is work; it is hard and
painstaking work; it is collective and creative work; it is diversity
work.]{.underline}**

### Yee

#### Debate should be a site for acceptance of [multiple viewpoints]{.underline} and [political deliberation]{.underline}, thus creating assemblages that will solve. 

**Yee 15** \[futurist, business strategist and freelance writer (Aubrey,

To escape the crocodile death roll of modernity thus requires the calm
serenity of fluid movement paired with the speed of instinct and
reaction. Such instinctual reaction in the face of certain death can
only be born of militant and repetitive practice until the reaction is
finally, purely instinctual. Like the surfer who survives a wipe-out on
a 100' wave, the calm that allows your body to go limp and ride out the
excruciating minutes of chaotic tumbling and lack of air can only come
from a thoroughly practiced and steady mind. [Finding joy and purpose in
political practice becomes critical to the longevity and intensity of
commitment]{.underline}. In words frequently attributed to him, Gary
Sirota explains why he surfs: "There are no more committed people on the
planet than surfers. We fall down a lot. We turn around, paddle back
out, and do it over and over again."9 In this same way, [we must become
addicted to the high of engagement. The **accumulation** of **[political
role experimentations]{.mark}**]{.underline} espoused by Connolly
[become a path for amplifying connection and perception and as **each
experiment** [makes a **small difference**, the]{.mark} **natural
amplification** of [effects]{.mark} "may [prepare us to **participate
with others** in]{.mark} **yet more [adventurous activities]{.mark}**["
that **counteract**]{.mark} the insistent amplification of **neoliberal
ideological forces**]{.underline}.10 In this prescription, [as we learn
to **surf** the **ceaseless [waves]{.mark}** [of **climate change**,
**species loss**, socio-economic **inequality**, **refugees**, **war**,
**surveillance** and **depressio**]{.mark}**n**, we find the **moments
of joy** and **connection** in the work that **keep us coming back**,
each time **more prepared** and capable of **surfing bigger waves** with
confidence.]{.underline} [To begin cultivating the necessary
qualities]{.underline}, Connolly's imagination of [the **'micro'** is
**instrumental**]{.underline}. He argues that, "Capitalism writ large...
sets too large and generic a target...[[The point]{.mark} today [is
**not** to **wait for a revolution** that **overthrows the whole
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}."11 To reinforce this hypothesis, Connolly
connects his vision of a vigilant micro-political commitment to our
daily entanglement with the microbiota within and all around us,
"because human and nonhuman systems regularly infuse and impinge upon
one another -- both at the microscopic level within human bodies and at
the macroscopic level between disparate systems."12 We can see this
phenomena manifested clearly with the increasing prevalence of
Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasitic protozoan typically found
in cat poo and implicated in a whole host of disorders perhaps most
notably and symbolically schizophrenia.13 Or in the way that a newborn
child is robbed of their very first protective microbial force field
when birthed by caesarean, a trend reaching upwards of 40 percent in
some countries like Chile.14 These and myriad other micro-biological
processes remind us daily that "We are not unique; we are merely
distinctive."15 Embracing that level of humility is crucial as we are
forced to evolve rapidly and transformatively in a not-so-distant future
filled with environmental wierding, socio-economic upheavals and chaotic
technological advances all underwritten by a neoliberal world order.
Humility, in this post-normal world becomes an invaluable asset,
allowing us to productively accept, understand and enhance our
positively parasitic partnership with unseen micro-realities rather than
becoming mired in the ego-ic experience of neoliberal individualism.
[Community is today more critical, and in fact more endangered, than it
has ever been]{.underline}. The realities that a parasite could induce
delusions of grandeur in the human mind, and that commodification of
health has led to children entering the world devoid of their first
microbial allies are significant for our understandings of modern
neoliberal politics. "Capitalist modes of acceleration, expansion, and
intensification that heighten the fragility of things today also
generate pressures to minoritize the world along multiple dimensions at
a more rapid pace that heretofore."16 Reversing this neoliberal tendency
to loosen beings from their connection to the web of existence is the
work of our time. Rebuilding our ability to sense connection and
resonance when it occurs, to hear our na'au when it speaks to us in new
languages, these are our challenges and our calling. Connolly mirrors
and re-resonates this value for micro-processes in his evaluation of
political will. [By positioning **role performance** as **political
experiment**, Connolly]{.underline} subtly [argues for the microbial
infection and amplification of day-to-day activity, indicating that
[**small deliberate choices** can lead to **entrenched
behaviors**]{.mark}]{.underline} much in the same way that ingestion of
the toxoplasma microbe can eventually lead to schizophrenia. He clearly
argues that "[role experimentations and the shape of the pluralist
assemblage thus infect one another.]{.underline}"17 [To ignore the
**tacit role performances** with which we **engage constantly** is to
then succumb to the habitual nature of practices that "**condense
previous relations** of **overt power**."]{.underline}18 Instead, [[we
are being asked by]{.mark} the inherent [fragility]{.mark} of things
[to]{.mark} **intentionally [foster
micro-political-performances]{.mark}** [that **enhance** our]{.mark}
**militant [democratic possibilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Coincidentally [these same performances will likely be the ones that
**inspire the most joy** within us; a joy that creates a space for us to
**persist** and **practice** despite a **mounting understanding of
catastrophe**.]{.underline} Whether it is a small group of scholars
gathering to discuss the fragility of things, or a blog one of us writes
later to critique neoliberal ideologies, or a smile given to a stranger
in a crowded public space, or a garden, planted in an abandoned city lot
to grow food and feed a neighborhood, [these **microscopic daily acts**
of **political will** reaffirm that "there is no zone of complete
neutrality in a world of role performances" and that there are
"significant relays between role performance, self-identity, and the
formation of larger political constellations.]{.underline}"19 In the
same way that we are constantly made and re-made by the microbial
biological realities at work within our bodies, [[our politics are
**constantly made** and **re-made**]{.mark} by the **micro-political
choices** and **identifications** we **collectively
propagate**]{.underline}. And yet, despite this insistence on
micro-political performativity[, [there is an]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**equally [urgent call]{.mark}** [to **reengage with the
state**]{.mark} as a site of activism]{.underline}. Treading lightly in
his prescriptions, [Connolly is]{.underline} nonetheless [explicit in
his concern for the mounting pressures to **discard the state
altogether**]{.underline}. Instead, he explains that, "[the fragile
ecology of late capital **requires state interventions** of **several
sorts**. A **refusal to participate** in the state today **cedes too
much hegemony** to **neoliberal markets**]{.underline}."20 [The scale of
the challenges we face and their planetary ubiquity **require state
intervention** as much as they require the resonance of community based
micro-politics. [We need a revolution **at all scales** to **reverse the
trends**]{.mark} that have brought us a world where **small island
nations** are being **swallowed by a rising ocean**; a world where many
say the sixth extinction is **already underway**]{.underline}; a world
where most Americans have little or no connection to most of their
closest neighbors. [The severity and ubiquity of the crisis demands an
equal amount of amplification and resonance from the other side of the
pendulum and this will **only come** if we engage "a **multisited
politics** designed to **infuse a new ethos** into the fabric of
everyday life]{.underline}."21 The political economy of late-late
capitalism is a moving assemblage -- its loose joints and disparate
edges tearing at the fragile fabric of communities in the midst of their
struggle to hold a center. And we must become painfully aware, if we
have not already, that in this day and age, the very notion of community
and the heterogeneity that deeply place-based community cultivates is
under heated attack from many sides. This is the fate of our neoliberal
embrace, for as Connolly suggests, "[neoliberalism is a form of
biopolitics that seeks to produce a nation of regular individuals, even
as its proponents often act as if they are merely describing processes
that are automatic and individual behavior that is free.]{.underline}"22
[This is perhaps the ultimate deception of the Anthropocene epoch and a
delusion that **could very well be our undoing**. Participation in this
delusion is partially a survival instinct, "since total immersion in the
dangers of the future and the contemporary condition can lead you to
neglect daily duties and needs]{.underline}."23 [These realities
coalesce to form an ever-greater argument for the **capacity of
micro-processes** as **change agents**. Harnessing the "potential power
of these subterranean flows" will allow us the **fortitude** to
**continue persisting** in a world entrenched in neoliberal
schizophrenia while simultaneously building the capacity for
self-organization and feedback loops that allow "a self-amplification
system to emerge]{.underline}", what Connolly calls a "creative
resonance machine" -- [one to **counter** and **unbalance** the machine
that is **literally consuming the planet** and **all its natural
resources**]{.underline}.24 This resonance machine would have
micro-political communities forming in various places around the world
which would then find connections among one another to build
ever-greater alliances that en masse have the potential to enact
Connolly's vision of the militant politics that are necessary to "defeat
neoliberalism, to curtail climate change, to reduce inequality, and to
instill a vibrant pluralist spirituality into democratic machines that
have lost too much of their vitality."25 [In the short term at least,
[it seems that we still **very much need**]{.mark} the institutions of
the [state as **final safe guards** against the **pervasive** and
**divisive individuality**]{.mark} that neoliberalism would have us
believe is paramount to freedom.]{.underline} [It is then within this
call to **role performance** as **political experiment**
that]{.underline} I believe [Connolly offers us a compelling way
forward. Imagining our **daily micro political maneuvers** as part of a
**larger resonance machine** embroiled in the best that a complex
universe has to offer is the **only way** we may]{.underline} find the
fortitude to relax our breath, conserve the last bits of oxygen we have
left and [**ride the chaos** of this massive wave until the set has
passed]{.underline} and we find our way to the sky for a quick and
critical breath. [Remembering with calm confidence that another set of
waves with equally chaotic power is very likely on its way.]{.underline}
At our constant aid is the innate human appreciation for aesthetic
experience. We may want to seriously consider the idea that aesthetics
are in fact a basic and physiological form of communicating ethics
between modes of existence such as living/non-living or human/non-human.
Joseph Campbell called this 'the problem of beauty,' and in an interview
with Bill Moyers he asked, "When a spider makes a beautiful web, the
beauty comes out of the spider's nature. It's instinctive beauty. How
much of the beauty of our own lives is about the beauty of being
alive?"26 Re-instilling our ethical imaginary with this positioning
allows for incorporation of both humility and reverence, two concepts
critical to the task of managing our fragility. Cultivating our
sensitivity to the inherent aesthetic communication of non-human beings
and things requires specific courage in a world full of apparent
suffering, but I believe that this courage is crucial and we can no
longer afford to deny our complicity in the state of things as they are.
Where I disagree with Connolly is primarily in his assessment of
thinking about and envisioning the future(s). Arguing for dedication to
an 'interim agenda,' Connolly suggests that "in a world of becoming the
more distant future is too cloudy to engage."27 While this may be true
on face value, [the cloudiness of the more [distant future **must not
preclude our engagement**]{.mark} with it]{.underline}. Instead, [at
this point in [history it is **more crucial than ever** to hone our
capacity for **engaging with uncertainty** and **becoming comfortable**
in the fog. It is through the **repeated** and **consistent practice**
of **imagining** and **envisioning preferred** and **alternative
futures**]{.mark} that we will **polish** and **strengthen** our
capacity for performing **militant** and **productive micro-politics**
in the present. The future is destined to be the artifact of those with
the **most militant imaginings** and we **cannot afford** to forego that
commitment for a focus **solely on the interim present**. Getting good
at experiment is part of this process]{.underline}. In fact ethical
experiment and resilience may be the words best suited to replace the
outdated and misused meme of sustainability. [**[Micropolitical
experiment]{.mark}** like microbial contagion [will **shape** and
**reshape our path**]{.mark} as we charge forward into an increasingly
chaotic future in a "cosmos of becoming."]{.underline}28

### Z&D

#### Ethical obligation to reject capital---economic calculus understates its destructive power

**Daly '4** Glyn Daly, senior lecturer in politics in the Faculty of
Arts and Social Sciences at University College Northampton,
Conversations With Zizek, 2004, pp. 14-16

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gord­ian knot of
postmodern protocol and recognize that [[our ethico-political
responsibility is to confront]{.mark} the constitutive violence of
today's global [capitalism]{.mark} and its obscene
naturalization/anonymization of the millions who are subju­gated by
it]{.underline} throughout the world. Against the standardized positions
of postmodern culture --- with all its pieties con­cerning
'multiculturalist' etiquette --- Zizek is arguing for a politics that
might be called 'radically incorrect' in the sense that it breaks with
these types of positions and focuses instead on the very organizing
principles of today's social reality: the principles of global liberal
capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long,
Marxism has been bedevilled by an almost fetishistic economism that has
tended towards political mor­bidity. With the likes of Hilferding and
Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffe, crucial theoretical
advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of
economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem
that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is
to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can
function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of
im­plicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an
ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist[, the fear of economism can end up
reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary
capitalism]{.underline} (i.e. [the initial prohibi­tion conjures up the
very thing it fears).]{.underline} This is not to endorse any kind of
retrograde return to economism. Zizek's point is rather that [in
rejecting economism [we should not lose sight of the systemic power of
capital in shaping]{.mark} the lives and destinies of humanity and
[our]{.mark} very [sense of the possible]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
particular we should not overlook Marx's central insight that [[in order
to create a uni­versal]{.mark} global [system]{.mark} the [forces of
capitalism]{.mark} seek to [conceal the politico-discursive violence of
its construction]{.mark} through a kind of gentrification of that
system.]{.underline} What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as
Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that the gentrification of global
liberal [[capitalism]{.mark} is one whose 'universalism' fundamentally
reproduces and [depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast
sectors of the world's population.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this way,
neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its
out­comes of winning and losing as if they were simply a matter of chance
and sound judgement in a neutral marketplace. Capitalism does indeed
create a space for a certain diver­sity, at least for the central
capitalist regions, but it is neither neutral nor ideal and its price in
terms of social exclusion is exorbitant. That is to say, [[the human
cost in terms of]{.mark} inherent [global poverty and degraded
'life-chances' cannot be calculated within]{.mark} the [existing
economic rationale]{.mark} and, in consequence, [social exclusion
remains mystified and name­less]{.mark}]{.underline} (viz, the
patronizing reference to the 'developing world'. And Zizek's point is
that this mystification is mag­nified through capitalism's profound
capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to redirect (or
misdirect) social antagonisms and to absorb them within a culture of
differ­ential affirmation. Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is
towards a kind of political boutiquism that is readily sus­tained by
postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle. Against this [Zizek
argues for a new universalism whose primary ethical directive is to
confront the fact that our forms of social existence are founded on
exclusion on a global scale.]{.underline} While it is perfectly true
that universalism can never become Universal (it will always require a
hegemonic-par­ticular embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is
novel about Zizek's universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal
this fact or to reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a
'glitch' in an otherwise sound matrix.

[The museum's permanent collection is a set of exhibits that puts
African ¶ dispersal into a global context]{.underline}. [It sets the
tone for the museum itself, situating its priorities in relation to
remembering the story of slavery and colonialism]{.underline} from the
perspective of four themes: origins, movement, adaptation, ¶ and
transformation. The front wall of the building is a glass window that ¶
allows one to see outside from the staircase, which leads to all the
floors of ¶ the museum. Next to the staircase is a three-story
photograph of the face of ¶ Africa, or more precisely, the face of a
little African girl. This photograph is ¶ the literal face of the
museum; because of the glass wall, it is visible from the ¶ street and
transforms the front of the building into an impressive tableau. ¶ The
original photograph was taken by Chester Higgins Jr. and incorporated ¶
into a photomosaic titled "Photographs from the African Diaspora," a
composite of over two thousand individual photographs. [The mosaic is a
significant archive of Black memory and is a permanent part of the
museum]{.underline}.¶ 2¶ The pictures line the staircases between the
museum floors. They are beautiful; they move me with their sheer force
of evidence in numbers. Each one ¶ touches an affective punctum that is
temporally situated through the setting, listening to the archives ¶
clothes, hairstyles, and other visual aspects of the subjects.¶ [Each
photograph ¶ tells a story---mothers and daughters, men in military
uniform, weddings, ¶ funerals, spiritual ceremonies, Black men with
children, men and women ¶ dancing, children at play, men and women at
work]{.underline}. They tell me a story ¶ that I already know, one of
pride and joy, resistance and endurance, family and love. [The
photographs also talk back to the ever-present narrative ¶ of the broken
Black family, which is challenged and reconstituted in many ¶ forms on
the museum wall.]{.underline} There is a phonic materiality to the
visual. I ¶ think of Fred Moten's insistence on the photograph that
screams as part of a ¶ mournful/political practice.¶ 4¶ I am reminded
that the purpose of the project ¶ is to provide what Hirsch and Spitzer
call "points of memory" or "points of ¶ intersection between past and
present, memory and postmemory, personal ¶ memory and cultural recall."¶
5 [They are included in the infrastructure of the ¶ museum in order to
make an argument or a point about Black memory]{.underline}.¶ 6¶ The
photographs argue for closure on the enduring questions regarding the ¶
inherent pathology of the Black family; they yell that the accusations
are ¶ untrue, that Black families do exist. **[Representation of a
normative resolution to the question of Black familial pathology
requires the suppression ¶ of any echo of queerness]{.underline}**. In
this context [queerness would be unmelodic, ¶ improvisational,
unpredictable, and irresolute]{.underline}.¶ On the second floor, there
are several sections that make up the permanent exhibit at MoAD. There
are more objects in the permanent collection ¶ that speak to me, to all
the visitors, about the normative Black subject. At ¶ the top of the
steps, leading into the second floor, is [an installation]{.underline}
on adornment. It [has three figures: a man, a child, and a
woman]{.underline}. The placards next ¶ to the figures describe the role
of adornment in culture, but to me [the story]{.underline} ¶ [they tell
is about gender]{.underline}. In the installation, the faces of the
figures separate from the torsos and morph into different ones. The
torsos also change ¶ every few seconds, mixing the traditional with the
contemporary, the urban ¶ with the rural. This fragmented Black body is
put back together in gender appropriate terms. [Difference,
multiculturalism, and diversity are celebrated ¶ in the facial
morphing]{.underline}. [Asian, African, and white European faces join
those ¶ of African descent]{.underline}, celebrating a mixed-racial
heritage, clearly eschewing ¶ racial purity. However, there is no male
face with lipstick, for example, or ¶ faces that challenge gender
binaries at all. Apparently, there is no place for ¶ gender variance in
this diasporic social imagining. **[There is a queer limit to ¶ how we
understand our history and ourselves]{.underline}**.¶ I[n MoAD the
photographs and the figures together tell a narrative that ¶ binds the
body to normative genders and to heterosexuality]{.underline}. [The
heterosexual matrix]{.underline}, as Judith Butler has explained, [is
the logic that links biology ¶ to gender]{.underline}
presentation/expression [and sexual object choice]{.underline}. The
expectation is that these qualities---anatomy, gender, and
sexuality---predict each other ¶ through a linear progression.¶ 7¶ The
visitor experiences this logic first by way ¶ of the images on display
in the photomosaic. Then, [figures]{.underline} at the top of ¶ the
stairs [remind us of the proscribed biological basis]{.underline} of the
familial [and ¶ communal representations]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
again [offer us]{.underline} [a]{.underline} resolution to the
accusations ¶ of Black familial pathology and gender aberrance in the
[biologically based ¶ nuclear family.]{.underline}

[In 2009, President Obama signed the The Matthew Shepard and James ¶

support to state ¶ and local jurisdictions that want to prosecute hate
crimes]{.underline}.¶ 4¶ [In the naming and representation of this
legislation, anti-Black violence and anti-gay ¶ violence are
separate]{.underline}. The law itself reinforces the separateness of
these two ¶ spheres, identifying "offenses involving actual or perceived

involving actual or perceived ¶ religion, national origin, gender,
sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability."¶ 5¶ In the language
of the law [it is assumed that "certain hate crime ¶ acts" are clustered
such that race and color are coextensive with religion and ¶ national
origin in ways that sexual orientation, gender, and gender identity ¶
are not]{.underline}. Entire communities are implicated in these
processes in that the ¶ individual and "the community sharing the traits
that caused the victim to ¶ be selected" are "savaged" by the hate
crime.¶ 6¶ The law takes for granted that ¶ collectives based on race
and color may also share religion and national origin, but [gender and
sexual orientation and gender identity are disassociated ¶ from
race]{.underline}. In the bill, [race itself is defined in relation to
the history of slavery and involuntary labor]{.underline}, [thereby
concretizing the decoupling of Blackness ¶ from gender and
sexuality]{.underline}, [belying the histories of Black queers as
integral ¶ to Black communities]{.underline} that the Black lesbian
fictional archive here asserts.¶ 7¶ [Matthew Shepard is the symbol of
victims of anti-gay violence, and ¶ James Byrd is the symbol of
anti-Black violence]{.underline}. [This split is indicative ¶ of how the
nation has come to understand these histories as distinct and ¶ separate
spheres]{.underline}. In 1998 Byrd was dragged behind a car, his body
violently ¶ mangled on an east-Texas road. Later that same year, Shepard
was found ¶ beaten, tortured, and bound to a fence where he was left to
die. As Eric Stanley states, ["\[T\]he queer inhabits the place of
compromised personhood and ¶ the zone of death]{.underline}."¶ 8¶
[However, not all queers are the same]{.underline}. The story of Mat
thew Shepard's murder has become a national symbol of the consequences ¶
of homophobia in ways that the murders of Black queers cannot because ¶
of the banality of Black death. Part of the shock of Shepard's murder is
the ¶ spectacular way that he was mutilated and displayed---a fate
usually reserved ¶ for Black men. James Byrd's horrifying murder is
recognizable as part of a ¶ history of lynching in the United States
that goes back to the nineteenth ¶ century.¶ 9¶ In 2008, ten years after
Byrd's death, Brandon McClelland was murdered under similar
circumstances in east Texas. In 2009 the district attorney ¶ dropped the
murder charges, citing lack of evidence.¶ 10¶ Brandon's murder ¶ shares
the context of state-sanctioned anti-Black violence with that of an ¶
endless litany of others who were killed by police, a list I merely
touch ¶ on here. In fact, the list of the murdered is too long for this
epilogue and ¶ would indeed fill the pages of this book. The following
accounting of well known deaths of Black people at the hands of police
actually stands in for a ¶ much longer list and symbolizes how Black
people across the United States ¶ collectively grieve anti-Black
violence. [My intention here is to do what the ¶ language of the
Shepard--Byrd Act implicitly denies is possible: to place the ¶
relatively unknown deaths and beatings of Black queer people in relation
to ¶ general trends of anti-Black violence and premature
death]{.underline}. The following is ¶ a calling of the names of the
dead, but it is by no means a comprehensive ¶ list. There are just too
many names. The sheer number of cases of murder ¶ and Black
state-sanctioned premature death physically and emotionally overwhelms
me, even as I cite cases that made it into local or national mainstream
news. And citation is key in the recognition of their deaths. Which ¶
ones do I name? Even as I write this epilogue, more Black queer people
die ¶ transphobic and homophobic deaths, and often at the hands of other
Black ¶ people. Here I hope to spark a continuation of the dialogue
started in this ¶ volume through Black lesbian literature. [Whom do we
remember as part of ¶ Black collective memory, and how does
disremembering the queer make that ¶ person a constitutive outsider to
Blackness]{.underline}, **[and thus someone who can be ¶ excised from
the world without collective grieving]{.underline}**?

**Rushing 11** \[Robert, University of Illinois, Associate Professor of
Spanish, Italian and Portugeuse; "Sirens without Us: The Future after
Humanity" Journal Issue: California Italian Studies; 2011;
<http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0cc3b56b>\] AW

I'll begin with three quick, recent examples of a radical way of
thinking about the future: that it might not be there at all. In No
Future, Lee [[Edelma]{.underline}n]{.mark} offers a political and
ethical provocation: he [[argues that all political thought up until now
has been governed by "reproductive futurism]{.mark}"]{.underline} (2004,
2), [one [that assumes that the measure and valuation of every act is
how it benefits an imagined future,]{.mark} the next generation. Edelman
dares]{.underline} his readers [to imagine a politics and an ethics that
are not posited on the invisible ground of the future.]{.underline} The
impetus for this provocation is Edelman's commitment to a radical queer
politics, one that is not predicated on an unspoken (and hence
universalized) allegiance to reproduction. In particular, Edelman ties
the imagination of "no future" to the question of enjoyment.
"[[Queerness,]{.mark}" he writes, "[is...a matter...of embodying a
remainder of the Real]{.mark}.... One name for this unnameable
remainder...is jouissance, sometimes translated as
'enjoyment]{.underline}'" (2004, 25). The [negativity]{.underline} (in
the sense of its power to negate) of enjoyment is a staple of Lacanian
thinking, and another term for it is [the death drive]{.underline}---for
Edelman, [[this disturbing excess of the Real]{.mark} (queerness) [is
also the death drive]{.mark}, a reminder that within the subject is
something that longs for no future, just as [the "queer"]{.mark} may be
what [perturbs the social field by imagining a politics without
reproductive futurism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2007, Alan Weisman
published a book entitled The World without Us, in which the author
examines what would happen to the Earth if all human life were to vanish
overnight. How long would it take for our houses to collapse, our
skyscrapers to fall, or our interstate highways to disappear? [Weisman's
book aims at portraying the slow disappearance not of humanity, but of
human traces.]{.underline} How long would it take before nothing would
be visible to an imaginary alien zooming overhead? How long until the
last traces would no longer be discoverable by anyone? [[The World
without Us was a thought-experiment]{.mark}, one [that
emphasized]{.mark} a kind of [dramatic realism]{.mark}]{.underline}, one
that aimed to illustrate (with a rather broad nod toward catastrophe
movies) just how and when the Golden Gate Bridge would collapse and the
Manhattan subway would flood with the waters of the Hudson. While
Weisman makes one or two gestures toward issues like overpopulation and
climate change, it's fairly clear that his book is designed primarily
[to thrill with its series of images seemingly drawn from
post-apocalyptic films, but scientifically plausible]{.underline}.
Although Weisman's book is intellectually slender (Robert Braille in the
Boston Globe called it "gratuitous" and "wispy"), it shares something
remarkable in common with Edelman---[[it assumes]{.underline}]{.mark}
(albeit tacitly) [[that imagining our own end is a form of
enjoyment]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the book's popularity indicates that
many agree. Tellingly, Weisman's "last traces" of humanity are our radio
and television broadcasts diffusing away from our planet, our own
enjoyments that will keep spreading throughout the universe long after
we are gone. For rather different reasons, in 2009's New Italian Epic
the Italian collective Wu Ming has also suggested writing and thinking
about literature that does not necessarily presume a future for
humanity.1 For Wu Ming the issue is, however, also political: like
Edelman, they note that essentially all of our thinking about the future
has been narcissistic, predicated on the assumption of our own survival.
¶ Ci rifiutiamo di ammettere che andiamo incontro all'estinzione come
specie. Certamente non nei prossimi giorni, e nemmeno nei prossimi anni,
ma avverrà, avverrà in un futuro che è intollerabile immaginare, perché
sarà senza di noi. È doloroso pensare che tutto quanto abbiamo costruito
nelle nostre vite e...in secoli di civiltà ammonterà a niente perché
tutto diviene polvere.... Altre specie umane si sono estinte prima di
noi, verrà anche il nostro momento (Wu Ming 2009, 56) ¶ ([We refuse to
admit that we're heading towards [extinction as a
species]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly not in the next few days, not
even in the next few years, [but it [will happen]{.mark},
it]{.underline} will happen in a future that is unbearable to imagine,
because it will be without us. It's painful to think that everything
we've built in our lives and...in centuries of civilization will amount
to nothing, because it will all become dust.... Other human species have
gone extinct before us, and our time, too, will come).2 ¶ [Wu
Ming]{.underline} is not being at all alarmist here---they [are only
taking the long view]{.underline}. The very long view: what they have in
mind is a time frame not of years, decades, centuries or even millennia,
but rather [[Darwinian time, geological time, astrophysical
time]{.mark}. This is [the kind of futurity that gives rise to a]{.mark}
recognition of a paradoxical "[no future]{.mark}." No matter how
enduring our species and our civilization may be, the truly long run is
that millions of years will almost certainly witness humans becoming
something that is no longer human, and an extinction of the "Old
Ones"]{.underline} (i.e., us). If not, the sun will turn into a red
giant and go supernova in a few billion years, and if somehow that would
not be enough, an even longer span of time will witness the extinction
of all the stars in the universe, and a gradual "heat death," in which
the universe will cool to within a fraction of a degree above absolute
zero.3 Such a future (or lack thereof) is unbearable, yes, but it is
also absolutely certain that it will come to pass. [[The task for the
writer]{.mark} then [becomes that of imagining a world without us, seen
by another]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} "Diverrà sempre più
importante---come aveva intuito Calvino---la 'resa' letteraria di
sguardi extra-umani, non-umani, non identificabili" (Wu Ming 2009, 58;
it will become increasingly important---as Calvino had guessed---to
render in literature those gazes that are extra-human, inhuman,
unidentifiable). Such experiments, Wu Ming suggest, have the power to
help us emerge from a strictly anthropomorphic line of thought, and
towards "un pensiero ecocritico" (59; an ecocritical way of thinking
\[emphasis in original\]). [Within Wu Ming's call for a literary
exploration of Darwinian time is an implied critique that is
structurally analogous to Edelman's: [when we lay a claim to the future,
we are implicitly laying a claim to a special st atus for ourselves. For
Edelman, futurity privileges the heterosexual "breeder," who
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} him- or herself [[into an imagined future,
along with]{.mark} a certain [heteronormativity.]{.mark}]{.underline}
For Wu Ming, futurity also assumes a privileged place for the human (and
in a certain sense, a privileged place for life itself). What would our
politics and ethics look like if we assumed as a starting place the non-
continuity of humanity? For Wu Ming, this is essentially work for the
imagination, and hence a task for literature, but most importantly, an
ethical act. It is altruism, of course: de-centering ourselves from a
special place at the center of the cosmos. Its first step would be to
imagine the future without us, or to imagine our own ending. But how to
imagine this futurity? Wu Ming cites Calvino as a precursor to this
inhuman future, as a writer who frequently turned to narrators and
characters who were "extra-human, inhuman or unidentifiable." Evidently,
they are thinking of Calvino's "cosmicomic" stories of the 1960s, which
feature a completely unidentifiable narrator, who by turns appears to be
a star, an elementary particle, a field of force, a shell, a dinosaur, a
bird, a fish, and even occasionally a human being. Or perhaps they are
also thinking of Agilulfo from Il cavaliere inesistente (1959 \[The
Nonexistent Knight, 1962\]), the Renaissance knight who did not actually
exist, but was merely a suit of armor animated by pure will and a dash
of obsessive-compulsive disorder. But [Calvino's putatively [inhuman
characters are of course human]{.mark}, more human than his human
characters, in fact]{.underline}. Part of Calvino's playful game in the
cosmicomic stories (no less in I nostri antenati \[Our Ancestors\]) is
to present these unusual actors in their unusual places (before the Big
Bang, inside a black hole, and so on), but as immediately recognizable
human types, filled with petty jealousies, bad manners,
cantankerousness, sexual desire, and all the rest. [They
are,]{.underline} in short, [[personified.]{.underline}]{.mark} Which
brings us to Paul De Man, and the question of giving a voice to the
dead. De Man is also interested in the inhuman gaze---specifically, the
inhuman gaze of a celestial object (perhaps he was reading Calvino...).
In "Autobiography as De-facement," De Man turns to the figure of the sun
in a Wordsworth poem, a sun that gazes, that sees, that bears witness to
a speech that endures beyond death. [He identifies]{.underline} this as
"the figure of prosopopeia, the fiction of [[an apostrophe to an
absent]{.underline}]{.mark}, deceased or voiceless [[entity, which
posits the possibility of the latter's reply and confers upon it the
power of speech]{.underline}]{.mark}" (1979, 926). Elsewhere in that
same essay, he calls prosopopeia "the fiction of the voice-from-
beyond-the-grave" (ibid., 927), and tightly links it to an
autobiographical mode of writing. [This is extremely suggestive for our
considerations of [an attempt to narrate our own absence, the future
without us]{.mark}. It suggests, for instance, that]{.underline} [this
desire [may not be so anti-anthropocentric after all, but is perhaps
simply a concealed way of re-inscribing our own narcissism, a way of
giving our own faces to the alien objects of the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The world without us may turn out to be
just our own story once again, written larger]{.underline}]{.mark}[. For
Wu Ming, imagining an "epic futurity]{.underline}" (of the truly longue
durée that implicates the disappearance of humanity) [necessarily
comports an ecocritical dimension]{.underline}. (If we're going to
vanish someday, then there's surely nothing special about us that
justifies our ¶ ¶ devouring of the planet's resources...) But without
doubt this de-centering move, relocating humanity to a trivial and
marginal space in the history of the universe, carries a necessary
prosopopeia: [in order [to imagine our own death, we must project our
own gaze and voice into the future space we had just evacuated of our
contaminating presence. To imagine any future at all is to imagine our
own human gaze, masochistically lonely, surviving the
apocalypse.]{.mark} "Death," De Man asserts, "is a displaced name for a
linguistic predicament]{.underline}" (1979, 930). After all, [[in
writing ourselves out of the picture, we must do so through recourse to
figurative language]{.mark}, a language that]{.underline}, for De Man,
[allows us to imagine at the expense of having the real
thing.]{.underline} The future without us that Wu Ming point to is a
future utterly without human voice or gaze; to imagine our own absence
is to see and hear nothing, because we are not there. [[Prosopopeia
specifically]{.mark} (and figurative language more generally) [is the
price we pay for admission to the spectacle of the universe after we no
longer exist]{.mark}---but it is [a spectacle formed wholly out of us.
The dead can speak, but only insofar as we ventriloquize them]{.mark};
the apparently [neutral or even universal ecocritical thought
elicited]{.mark} by Wu Ming's inhumanly long future [is our own value,
an anticipated nostalgia for what good stewards we humans were back when
we were still around.]{.mark} More precisely, the "exterior" and
impartial ecocritical value that Wu Ming find in our absence is their
value]{.underline}---one I share, to be sure, but still recognizable as
a particular political- ethical belief.4 After all, [the Earth could
care less what abuses we perpetrate upon it, [unless we fantasize our
own consciousness in it,]{.mark} personify her (and give her a sex and a
gender), [place a mask on her face]{.mark} (was it a face at all, before
we personified it?) [that suspiciously resembles our own
features]{.mark}.]{.underline} One might extend this pitiless argument
further---since if in the truly long term, absolutely everything will
turn into a frozen, unchanging soup, then there is absolutely no reason
not to exploit the planet mercilessly. [[There is,]{.mark} after all,
ultimately [no future for us or the planet]{.mark}, or even life itself,
so what difference will our careful stewardship make over the truly long
term? Carpe diem never sounded so good.]{.underline}

Michael J. Morris [At the conjunction of "queer" and "ecology", there is
the potential for reconfigurations of the living material world, as well
as for articulations of other possible worlds of life and livability.
For myself, "queer" and "ecology" are not merely signifiers for a
pre-existing real; rather, these terms operate within historically
situated material-discursive productions, practices through which the
world is not only represented, but also actualized.]{.underline} For
"queer", [these practices are generally concerned with destabilizing
regulatory norms of heterosexism that are naturalized through social
(re)productions in which lives and livability are constrained along the
axes of binary]{.underline} -- and asymmetrical -- [gender/sex and an
economy of heterosexual reproduction.]{.underline} These naturalizations
of heterosexism become iterated through discourses ranging from the
natural sciences to the social sciences to the humanities and the arts,
as well as through daily performances of bodies as they are lived.
"[Queer" functions as a spectrum of critical interventions in such
normalizing material-discursive practices, articulating possibilities
for bodies and lives that do not adhere to the rigid regulation of
naturalized heterosexism.]{.underline} Productions of "ecology" also
span the natural and social sciences, the humanities, and the arts,
encompassing a terrain of diverse analyses, categorizations, and
representations of "nature" -- or the living material world -- as a
complex system of interdependency. What circulates as "ecology" informs
environmental policy and activism, what counts as "nature" and
"natural", and popular understandings of the human situation in the
world, influencing ethical orientations as well as the practical
implementations of those ethics in day to day living within human and
nonhuman naturecultures. [One potential for a "queer ecology" is the
critique of ecological practices as material-discursive apparatuses that
participate in the naturalization of heterosexism through how they
represent -- and thus produce -- the world of interconnected lives and
livability. To queer ecology]{.underline}, then, [is to extend the
critical intervention of "queer" towards expanding what becomes livable
for both the human and nonhuman, precisely in their relational
interconnectedness.]{.underline} Coming from Dance Studies, my
particular investment in queer ecology is towards critical analyses of
the ways in which performance -- from theatrical productions to
performances in daily life -- operate at intersections of sexuality and
ecology. [As both sexuality and ecology are constituted through
durational material-discursive practices, I am interested in how
performance as a diverse spectrum of embodied activity orients and
positions human and nonhuman bodies towards one another, enacting
ecologies and sexualities that potentially subvert naturalized
heterosexist productions of both.]{.underline} In particular, I am
interested in performances that enact encounters between bodies that
disrupt normative conventions of sexuality in ways that also destabilize
the exceptional category of "the human", enacting relationalities that
reconfigure the world as an endless event of intra-activity through
which human and nonhuman material agents are themselves differentially
materialized. I believe that [through such performances of "queer
ecologies", new ontologies can become performatively articulated,
reorienting and proliferating what is possible within sexual and
ecological framings of bodies, the material- discursive practices
through which such bodies and their framings are produced, and --
ultimately -- what becomes livable within the worlds that they
materialize.]{.underline}

**[[Heteropatriarchy is the building block of US empire]{.mark}. In
fact, it is the building block of the nation-state form of
governance]{.underline}**. Christian Right authors make these links in
their analysis of imperialism and empire. For example, Christian Right
activist and founder of Prison Fellowship Charles Colson makes [**the
connection between homosexuality and the nation-state in his analysis of
the war on terror, explaining that one of the causes of terrorism is
same-sex marriage: [Marriage is the traditional building block of human
society]{.mark}, intend- ed both to unite couples and bring children
into the world \... There is a natural moral order for the family\...
the family, led by a married mother and father, is the best available
structure for both child- rearing and cultural health. [Marriage]{.mark}
is not a private institution designed solely for the individual
gratification of its participants. If we fail to enact a Federal
Marriage Amendment, we can expect not just more family breakdown, but
also more criminals behind bars and more chaos in our streets." Colson
[is linking]{.mark} the well-being of [US empire to the]{.mark}
well-being of the [heteropatriarchal family]{.mark}. He continues: When
radical Islamists see American women abusing Muslim men, as they did in
the Abu Ghraib prison, and when they see news coverage of same-sex
couples being "married" in US towns, we make this kind of freedom
abhorrent-the kind they see as a blot on Allah's creation. We must
preserve traditional marriage in order to protect the United States from
those who would use our depravity to destroy us.**]{.underline} As A n n
Burlein argues in Lift High the Cross, it may be a mistake to argue thac
the goal of Christian Right politics is to create a theocracy in the
United States. Rather, **[[Christian Right politics work through the
private family]{.mark} (which is [coded as white, patriarchal, and
middle class) to create a "Christian America]{.mark}." She notes that
the investment in the private family makes it difficult for people to
invest in more public forms of social connection. In addition,
[investment in the suburban pri- vate family serves to mask the public
disinvestment in urban areas that makes the suburban lifestyle
possible]{.mark}. The social decay in urban areas that results from this
disinvestment is then construed as the result of deviance from the
Christian family ideal rather than as the result of political and
economic forces]{.underline}**. As former head of the Christian
Coalition, Ralph Reed, states: "'The only true solution to crime is to
restore the family,"10 and "Family break-up causes poverty."" Concludes
Burlein, **["'The [family' is]{.mark} no mere metaphor but [a crucial
technology by which modern power is produced]{.mark} and
exercised."'\*]{.underline}** As I have argued elsewhere, **[in order to
colonize peoples whose societies are not based on social hierarchy,
[colonizers must]{.mark} first [naturalize hierarchy]{.mark} through
instituting patriarchy]{.underline}**.13 **[In turn, [patriarchy rests
on a gender binary system in which only two genders exist, one
dominating the other]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Consequently, Charles
Colson is correct when he says that **[the colonial world order depends
on heteronormativity. Just as the patriarchs rule the family, the elites
of the nation-state rule their citizens. [Any liberation struggle that
does not challenge heteronormativity cannot substantially challenge
colonialism or white supremacy.]{.mark} Rather]{.underline}**, as Cathy
Cohen contends, **[[such struggles will maintain colonialism based on a
politics of secondary marginalization where the most elite class of

marginalized within the community]{.mark}. Through this process of
secondary marginalization, [the]{.mark} national or [racial justice

model as them]{.underline}! point of its struggle-[[a model of
governance in which the elites govern]{.mark} the rest through violence
and domination, as well as exclude those who are not members of \"the

vulnerable to being coopted by the Right when we base them on [a model
of liberation]{.mark} that [fundamentally challenges right-wing
conceptions]{.mark} of t h e world . [We need a model based on community
relationships and on mutual respect]{.mark}.]{.underline} Conclusion
[Women of color-centered organizing points to the centrality of gender
politics within antiracist, anticolonial struggles. Unfortunately, in
our efforts to organize against white, Christian America, [racial

assimilate into white America, or to replicate it within an equally
hierar- chical and oppressive racial nationalism]{.mark} in which the
elites of the community rule everyone else. [Such struggles often call
on the importance of preserving the "Black family" or the "Native

conceived of in capitalist and heteropatriarchal
terms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The response is often increased homophobia,
with lesbian and gay community members con- strued as "threats" to the

itself.]{.mark} Perhaps, instead, we can reconstitute alternative ways

Although this work is important and helpful, I will argue that much of
it downplays the very attributes that make nuclear war unique. [It is
unsurprising that scholarship in communication studies tends to focus on
the potential for political awareness and change based on language or
symbolic action]{.underline}. [Rhetorical criticism has roots in the
deliberative discourse of ancient Athens and emphasizes the important
link between rhetoric and democratic change.]{.underline} [To call for
more public deliberation or transparency on nuclear war is to treat it
like any other issue of national politics that can be studied, debated,
and ultimately addressed as rhetoric motivates political
action]{.underline}. Indeed, a [great deal of media exists to make
meaning out of the Bomb, organize its potential use, and describe its
political significance]{.underline}. In the Bomb's inaugural moment at
Trinity, however, the immediate reaction was silence, followed by a
conviction that language was an inadequate tool to convey the
experience. [The "unthinkable," "unspeakable," and "unsayable" qualities
of nuclear war have since been repeatedly affirmed]{.underline}. The
Bomb seems to escape symbolization, to gesture towards something beyond
mediation. Many commentators struggle to speak at a limit where
"[language no longer acts as currency," to borrow from Georges
Bataille]{.underline} (Erotism 276). What happens when the crisis in
which we must intervene is one defined in part by the failure of the
symbolic efficiency of language? How can we communicate a political
response when the advent of the Bomb is understood to sunder mediation
itself? [The awesome power of the Bomb reveals the fundamental inability
of language to fully capture the universe beyond human
reality]{.underline}, the precariousness of our existence, and the
arbitrariness of our beliefs. [But with all the horror of the unknown,
there is also an unmistakable fascination with the promise of unmediated
continuity with reality]{.underline}. My argument here is not that
communication inevitably fails, although certainly it often does.
**[Language is not too small for the task]{.underline}**. Reality is too
big. Sometimes, [especially **when we attempt to understand something
that threatens human extinction**]{.underline}, [we are confronted with
the fact that the universe far outstrips our capacity to understand,
that the world we build for ourselves does not exhaust all chance and
possibility but sometimes appears to teeter on the edge of the
meaningless chaos intimated by a universe in which we are the center
only for ourselves]{.underline}. There is an excess that is understood
as beyond mediation, but our efforts to communicate continue. The
awestruck silence of the Bomb still works on the language that we do
produce as we attempt to find the means to describe it. For Bataille,
there was continuity---the unmediated world without distinctions imposed
by human classification, the world we seek in love and death (Bataille,
Erotism 12-13). For Heidegger, what lurked in the shadow of human
artifice was the "gigantic" (das Risige), an intimation of some
incalculable greatness (135). For Longinus, [the sublime was the force
of "greatness" that made language overwhelm rather than persuade, the
power beyond language that could only be partially intimated by its
skillful us]{.underline}e (4). These concepts all dovetail with Lacan's
Real, deliniated more completely in Chapter 1. The Real is not the world
of non-human objects and forces but the eruption of that world into the
mediated world of human society constructed and maintained by our
communication with one another. Excess, whether approached through the
language of the Real, the sublime, continuity, or Heidegger's
"gigantic," shapes the field of language around it like the gravity well
of a black hole observable by its distortions. These distortions guide
our investments in some tropes over others and shape the economy of
affects1 that animate meaning and create the durable constructs through
which we attempt to connect with one another. We cannot respond to the
Bomb by exposing its "reality" in writing, speeches, films, or any other
media without implicitly playing its game by insisting that language can
accurately convey the excess of the Real because the question is not one
of greater precision in language but whether any medium is capable of
assimilating the Real, a task which is impossible by definition.
Although I have used the term occasionally, I have generally preferred
"cathexis" to "affect" here to avoid debates over the meaning of the
latter term, which although assuredly important, are not necessary for
me to engage here. In acting as if this was not the case, we participate
in the desire for unmediated access to reality that maintains the Bomb's
power in the first place. [Too much debate over nuclear policy sidelines
this sense of the Bomb as infinite, focusing on the techniques of
organization and persuasion to the detriment of the ultimate questions
that make the Bomb so powerful and creating a linguistic framework in
which these questions are written off, or at best appended as "useful
embellishment," only "received into mainstream discourse when presented
as appendages to currently debated political options]{.underline}"
(Chernus, Nuclear Madness 59). [The Real of the Bomb reveals the
incompleteness of this world and motivates attempts to find what we
imagine is concealed beneath it]{.underline}. **[Nuclear obliteration is
to its devotees perhaps even a promise of divine Truth]{.underline}**
that offers transcendence of the fallen world of mediation in which
reality is never complete. With such a contradictory set of attachments,
it is hard to imagine that efforts to think about the Bomb can achieve
their goals---while they might demonstrate their own consistent logic,
[the rationality of nuclear politics is warped by the intrusion of the
Real and the desire to commune with it directly]{.underline}.
[Communication studies is full of cogent analyses of instances where
language or other media worked very well indeed to organize political
responses, persuade audiences, bind people together around texts, and
change attitudes, but these accounts are incomplete without attention to
the Real.]{.underline} The subject of nuclear war challenges how we
think about communication itself and demands new thinking on the limits
of mediation. The central question of this dissertation is not how
should we talk about nuclear war, but what can nuclear war show us about
how we attempt to mediate that which we understand to exceed the limits
of mediation itself? For attempt we do. The vertiginous hole in the
whole of reality is only the first part of the Bomb's relationship to
desire. Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does the symbolic order through
which the human world is built. The Symbolic, as Jacques Lacan styles
it, cannot tolerate the revelation of its inadequacy in the Real, the
tears left in our map by the inhuman world. We endlessly attempt to heal
the rifts of the Real, to feign unicity where it has failed (Lundberg
2-3). The response to chaos is control; order is imposed against
contingency in an effort to re-impose coherence. This dynamic of
automaton (order) scripted over tuché (contingency) is developed in
Chapter 2. When these attempts fail---and because the Real by its nature
cannot be assimilated, they must---we simply try again. In Lacanian
psychoanalysis, this dynamic is the repetition compulsion, in which the
subject tries again and again to control the conditions for presence and
absence, enjoying not the outcome but the exercise of subjectivity
itself in the capacity to act and to choose. Subjectivity requires the
sacrifice of continuity through the formation of the alienating identity
of the mirror phase, a process explained more in Chapters 1 and 2.
Discontinuous subjects are organized in part around the lack---something
that would make them whole again, represented in an object that is never
more than a partial stand-in for this missing completion. Frustrated in
the quest for something outside, we enjoy our own subjectivity.2 In the
context of nuclear war, this meant ever more sophisticated simulations
of a phenomenon about which we remained basically uncertain. This is the
second movement of desire in (or for) the Bomb. The enjoyment of our
reasserted control over 2 "Enjoyment" is meant here in the Lacanian
sense of jouissance, not as happiness or fulfillment, but as an
attachment to something that often exceeds pleasure and manifests in
quite harmful ways. the Bomb manifested in the repeated attempts to
simulate its use and predict its aftermath. The fort-da game described
by Freud and explained here in the first two chapters is an important
tool for unpacking this dynamic because it posits a sense of control
over presence and absence as the condition for a subject's enjoyment.
Fort-da refers to the game in which a child makes an object disappear
and reappear in succession, simulating her or his mother's coming and
going and the possibility of her eventual disappearance. Enjoyment comes
from the subject's control over these states of presence and absence, a
small example of imposing order in a world of seeming chaos (Freud,
Beyond the Pleasure Principle 13-17). Understanding this is necessary to
draw the common threads between the cold-blooded excesses of Pentagon
nuclear plans, the compulsion that leads survivalists to stockpile rooms
full of MREs, and the appeal that apocalyptic videogames hold for
millions of players. In all of these pursuits, [the world is made absent
in the fantasy of destruction and present again in the myth of
reconstruction, survival, and rebirth]{.underline}. [Nuclear weapons
scholarship evinces its own compulsion to repeat: myriad investigations
of nuclear texts are done, but each leaves something
unanswered]{.underline}. The movements of desire are incompletely by
scholarship on nuclear weapons concerned only with exposing the truths
of nuclear danger, analyzing specific instantiations of nuclear
rhetoric, or developing a vocabulary for democratic political
resistance. While the instrumental and political aspects of language are
important, to focus too narrowly on specific discourses threatens to
neglect the forest for the trees. The political movements that attracted
great attention in the 1980s---opposition to the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the Nuclear Freeze Movement, and the radical disarmament
movement---were at best partial successes. This is not to say that these
movements or their scholarly treatments are unimportant---they are
certainly helpful for those concerned with nuclear activism and
decisionmaking. Still, even if we slowly trace an asymptotic relation to
the zero of nuclear desire, part of the process is recognizing the pull
this unattainable zero has on our efforts to track it and how those
investments sustain the larger discourse of nuclear warfare. That larger
system persists almost unchanged, with thousands of weapons prepared for
launch on short notice, an endless profusion of war plans, an official
policy to secure peace through the threat of genocide, and almost
complete public ignorance that the sword of Damocles still hangs from
its slender thread. The primary difference between nuclear awareness in
1985 and 2015 as it relates to their own weapons is that ever [fewer
citizens of the nuclear states even bother to check how much the rope is
fraying]{.underline}. In other words, the material artifice of nuclear
warfighting persists despite repeated attempts to understand its
persuasive elements. [Existing attempts to study nuclear weapons could
benefit from the concept of the death drive as a problematic for
communication studies.]{.underline} The Bomb and the Mustard Pot To
situate the death drive in this way requires some discussion of
communication itself. The sense of this word has changed over time.
Before it came to refer to the transfer of meaning, especially through
technological apparatuses, communication had a sense of material
transfer, as retained in the contemporary military phrase "lines of
communication." John Durham Peters, in noting the mutability of the
word, understands communication to be the "project of reconciling self
and other," stressing the importance of material signifying media, as
opposed to the dream of "wordless contact" through the otherworldly
means of angels, telepathy, and spirit mediums (9). From a Lacanian
perspective, [communication might be better understood as a project of
reconciliation between self and Othe]{.underline}r. Entry into the
Symbolic order means identification with a signifier that can be
recognized by others. The unified identity developed in the mirror stage
(see Chapter 2) is a signifier among others, which permits the subject
to participate in the economy of the Symbolic. As Lacan defines the
concept, a signifier is a subject for another signifier (Lacan, Four
Fundamental Concepts 207). Prior to communication with specific others,
where we indeed often do not find reconciliation anyway, is integration
with the Other. This logical priority is acknowledged by Peters himself
when he argues that communication between individuals becomes thinkable
only in the "shadow" of mediated communication, or as he puts it, "Mass
communication came first" (6). Peters argues that communication with
others, understood as an exchange of ideas or meaning, is never perfect
because we are discontinuous beings limited by our physical
differentiation. "Our sensations and feelings are," he writes,
"physiologically speaking, uniquely our own. My nerve endings terminate
in my own brain, not yours. No central exchange exists where I can patch
my sensory inputs into yours, nor is there any sort of 'wireless'
contact through which to transmit my immediate experience of the world
to you" (4). This fundamental separation is resonant of the sacrifices
necessary for the emergence of the subject in Lacan's account and also
in that of Georges Bataille. For Bataille, the fundamental act of human
subject formation is a negation of our complete continuity, an act of
negation that sets us apart from one another and requires language as a
compensatory means (Bataille, "Hegel, Death and Sacrifice" 14-16). But
if communication is a chasm, it is also a bridge, as Peters
notes---despite our difference, we do, surprisingly, succeed sometimes
(21-22). What limits our ability to commune is also what permits us to
communicate: the necessity of using some medium to construct a bridge,
however tenuous, across the gulfs of our individuation. For me, this is
what unites the disparate subfields of communication studies, from
performance ethnography to quantitative interpersonal communication.
[Communication studies must be, at its heart, the study of mediation
because mediation is the necessary and sufficient condition for all
attempts at communication]{.underline}. German media theorist Friedrich
Kittler has focused on the condition of mediation itself, dubbed "the
presupposition of mediality" by David Wellbery. Mediality is a
generalized understanding of media, backing off from a specific medium
such as film to recognize the condition of being mediated as such. For
Kittler, technological possibilities of an era make possible specific
media modalities, and these modalities in turn determine what can take
shape. The condition of mediality entails a different understanding of
literature, for example, because like other media, it is a means of
processing, transmitting, and storing data (Wellbery xiii). Kittler
posits quite simply "Media determine our situation" (xxxix). Here his
message dovetails with Marshall McLuhan's famous claim that "the medium
is the message," which he elaborated in Understanding Media: "This is
merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any
medium---that is, of any extension of ourselves---result from the new
scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of
ourselves, or by any new technology" (McLuhan 7). Kittler's
presupposition of mediality might be formulated as a more radical
inversion of McLuhan's statement: it is humanity which is the extension
of media, in that the conditions of mediation determine the
possibilities for human subjects. Lacan argued that the Symbolic
requires a signifier around which the subject is organized, and with
Kittler's addendum, media produce the field of possible interactions for
those subjects. In Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Kittler links the
eponymous media technologies with the components of Lacan's Borromean
knot in the registers of the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic,
respectively. This focus on the materiality of media might be seen as an
effort to finally banish the "ghosts" of unmediated contact that Peters
identifies haunting mainstream notions of communication. It expands
mediation (or mediality) to encompass nearly everything wrought by
sapient hands, and in principle, a good deal more. It also demands a
practice of criticism geared towards the specificity of media rather
than a dematerialized meaning of text. This is a promising avenue of
approach to the Bomb, which Peters pairs with the computer as a "spur to
the imagination" evoking both excitement and anxieties for communication
(Peters 28). The range of nuclear media I examine here differ
meaningfully from one another in form. The nuclear simulations and games
discussed in Chapter 2, for example, cannot be understood simply as
texts because to do so ignores the agency of players' (or simulators')
choices, and the enjoyment that results from them (Aarseth 4). It is
precisely the danger that a textual approach might be applied wholesale
to all media that lead Packer and Crofts Wiley to dismiss material
rhetoric, which they claim "decenters texts" but also "runs the risk of
turning everything into a text, potentially undervaluing the vital
properties, potentials, and effects of materiality itself in favor of a
hermeneutic interpretation that focuses entirely on the symbolic and the
persuasive" (111). It would be wise not to read this statement as a
condemnation of rhetoric in its entirety based on the one edited
collection cited to support their argument. In another context, Packer
and Crofts Wiley quote Peters cautioning against "a kind of rhetorical
blackmail in being more materialist than thou...a kind of bullying that
goes along with claiming to be materialist" (108). Work that can be
safely described as rhetorical criticism (even if not "material
rhetoric") now exists focused on public monuments, museums, war
memorials, videogames, films, and television shows (e.g., Gallagher and
LaWare; Taylor, "Radioactive History;" Balthrop, et. al; Bogost
Persuasive Games; Lundberg, "Enjoying God's Death;" Cloud). While it
would be a mistake to reduce all media solely to texts, that outcome is
not inevitable, any more than the reductio ad absurdum that privileging
material mediation at the expense of rhetorical valence makes Sesame
Street and Wonder Showzen indistinguishable from one another. Ideally,
textual and material approaches would be used together since there is no
reason that they mutually exclude one another, thus Packer and Crofts
Wiley's reservations might be best read here as a warning against
methodological fundamentalism as it might exist in material rhetoric
today rather than an argument for the impossibility of harmony between
different approaches. Kittler writes that the "ur-media" of gramophone,
typewriter, and film converge in fiber optic cables, a technology that
can transmit any medium. Any medium but one, that is. As Kittler writes,
"fiber optics transmit all messages imaginable save for the one that
counts---the bomb" (1). Kittler is referring (incorrectly) to the
immunity of fiber optic networks to electromagnetic pulse effects of
nuclear explosions, something discussed at length by survivalist
literatures analyzed in Chapter 4. But there is another reason that this
message, "the only one that counts," escapes most materialist
explanations of media, rhetorical or otherwise. [The Bomb's awesome
force derives originally not from the messages it sends in the Symbolic
register but from its capacity to disrupt those connections, and worse,
to expose them as meaningless]{.underline}. The Real for Kittler is
embodied in the "nonsense" noises captured by the gramophone that
"haunted" textually-based psychoanalysts (89-90). It is a remainder,
waste, the disorder of bodies that remain outside the Symbolic and
Imaginary registers (16). But what, then, is outside mediation?
Kittler's understanding of the Real positions it as what is left over
when the Symbolic and the Imaginary are subtracted---the signals we
receive that aren't assimilated into these orders or that are cut up,
mangled, and made unintelligible against the language for which we are
"pets, victims, or subjects" (109). I propose to understand the Real in
an additive sense, not a subtractive one. The Real is not the noise left
outside the Imaginary and the Symbolic. [Rather, the Real "doesn't lack
anything]{.underline}" (Lacan, Anxiety 185[). It is not even the world
of non-signifying things or the totality of Bataille's
continuity]{.underline}. [The Real is the intrusion of a nonhuman world
that it is wholly alien, forcing humans to confront the fact of our
superfluity in the face of the universe's lack of any lack, including
us.]{.underline} As I will explore in Chapter 1, the most significant
acoustic phenomenon of the Trinity test was not the "roar that warned of
doomsday," as one general put it, but the silence that followed it when
mediation failed outright. Silence is not a lack, but an excess, an
affirmative force that disrupts symbolic media. At the same time, it is
by definition the absence of mediation. Nonsense sounds captured on a
phonograph stand in for unthinkable rather than constituting it, and as
such, they already gesture towards something else. They are part of the
order that reasserts an intelligible world after its breakdown, but they
do not impart it without their own mediation. A parable might illustrate
the relationship between material media and the rhetoric of the sublime.
In his seminar on anxiety, Lacan indulges in a lengthy digression from
his theme to discuss the collection of ceramic pots at his country
house. Lacan illustrates his point further: In all cultures you can be
sure that a civilization is already complete and in place when you can
find its first ceramics. Sometimes I contemplate a really very fine
collection of vases I have in my country house. Evidently, for those
people, in their time, as many other cultures show, it was their main
asset. Even if we are unable to read what is wonderfully and lavishly
painted on their sides, even if we are unable to translate them into an
articulated language of rites and myths, one thing we do know---in this
vase, there is everything. The vase is enough, man's3 relation to the
object and to desire is there in its entirety, tangible and enduring.
(186) The identity of the pots is defined in different ways. First, the
materials from which they are constructed differ. All of them have their
own unique designs, imperfections, and shapes that distinguish them from
one another. Second, what unites them is their empty space---the "void"
around which they are built. This void is not what is missing, but
precisely what must be there. This void, he writes, is "what can be
substituted between the pots, is the void around which the pot is
formed." In the third and final phase, human action begins when "the
void is barred, in order to be filled with what will constitute the void
of the pot beside it, when, for a pot, being half-full is the same thing
as being half-empty" (Lacan, Anxeity 185-6). The labels between pots can
be switched to mystify their contents such that the subject seeking
redcurrant jam ends up instead with rhubarb. And of course, the mustard
pot is always empty. "The only time there is any mustard is when it gets
up your nose" (186). How might scholars of communication studies profit
from the insight that "in this vase, there is everything?" Recall that
communication has the sense of "transport." The vases or pots in Lacan's
parable are containers, and through them move a variety of substances.
As he says, he is "not in the least bit fussy about how pots are used"
(186). 3 I take "man" in this context to refer not to human subjects
generally, nor to males, biological or otherwise specifically, but to
subjects exhibiting a "masculine" form of jouissance, as Lacan labels
it. This describes a desire for the lost object to fill the lack, as in
the (arguably inappropriately named) "phallic" mode of jouissance. This
theme is developed in detail throughout Seminar XX, Encore: On Feminine
Sexuality. The pots are defined in their difference by their varied
materials, which are therefore significant in and of themselves as
markers of identity. These material traits are important even if we are
unable to read the inscriptions on their sides. Pots are not texts, and
they can't necessarily be "read" this way. But the trait that unites
them and justifies their inclusion in a single group is not their
material, their shape, or even their function as glue pot, mustard pot,
decorative vase, or rhubarb jars deceptively labeled redcurrant jam. The
pot is defined by the space it encloses, the necessary condition for it
to function as container. This space is not nothing, for the Real lacks
nothing, but it is defined by its function as absence, or as a "void."
In this analogy, that void is the Real. It is what defies the substance
of the pot itself, which through its shape around the void is equivalent
to other pots and through its material characteristics is
distinguishable from them---traits that describe the Symbolic. We place
contents into these pots, investing them with what we imagine they must
hold---an operation on the level of the Imaginary. And what makes the
mustard pot a mustard pot, even when empty, is the accreted habit of
putting mustard in that pot instead of another one which could equally
well have held it. The pot is a metaphor for metaphor, "the archetrope
on the ground of which all the airy fabric of language has been
constructed" (Miller 66). The pot holds something, keeping it
together---as Lacan writes, "a pot is something that doesn't leak all
over the place" (186). The metonymy of spilling mustard on one's shirt
does not make it a mustard pot because the connection is accidental (in
more than one sense). The word "metaphor," like communication, has a
sense of material transfer. Its Greek origin, metapherein, denotes
transfer, literally "between containers." What makes a pot a metaphor is
its potential to contain something, as a trope "contains" meaning. That
potential is the empty space. I will argue in Chapter 1 that this Real
aspect of trope is what allows us to cathect, or invest, in it, just as
the void of the pot is what allows it potentially to be filled. For now,
I want to observe that to describe the pot's construction without
accounting for this space is to miss something essential to its
function. This is the cost of an excessive focus on materiality alone.
Similarly, to see the pot only as a void without attending to the
specificity of its shape, analogous to the impulse to reduce everything
to text, is to forgo specificity in favor of describing a universal
function that is not meaningful in the abstract because the pot defines
the void, just as the void defines the pot. Both approaches are
necessary. This is the kind of container that confronts us in all
efforts to mediate: not just a vase, but a Rubin vase. The Sublime [It
is here that rhetoric usefully supplements the material sense of
mediation understood by Kittler, McLuhan, and others in their
camp]{.underline}. One part of Packer and Crofts Wiley's objection to
material rhetoric should still be parsed out. [Rhetoric may not
inevitably impose the framework of the text, but it still might
overemphasize persuasion]{.underline}. A vision of rhetoric as
persuasion exercised within a specific context ultimately describes
operations in Lacan's order of the Imaginary, as opposed to the Real and
the Symbolic (Lundberg, Lacan in Public 39-43). [Criticism in this vein
focuses on the content of specific rhetorical expressions and effects at
the cost of a more fundamental explanation of the underlying logic of
the Symbolic which makes specific rhetorical expressions meaningful in
the first place. In Lundberg's words, "fetishizing persuasion as the
primary means of rhetoric's effectivity draws rhetoric's attention away
from the functions of trope and investment that constitute the subject
and its discourses"]{.underline} (Lacan in Public 184). It is as if,
given an equation with a variable X, [we focus all of our attention
debating over what value we should assign to the variable **at the
expense of examining the equation itself**]{.underline}. [Persuasion is
enabled by an economy of affect that provides the resources and
structure for meaning to be expressed in any given act]{.underline}. In
other words, every text, artefact, or sign related to nuclear weapons is
a trope interpretable only with reference to a larger system of
arbitrary tropes, a system held together by our repeated investments in
the connections that bind it. There is an alternative tradition in
rhetoric that might help address the broader ecology of desire that
underpins nuclear war, one at least as ancient as Aristotle's famous
emphasis on the means of persuasion. The sublime, best explained by
Longinus but with roots that precede Socrates, has to do with the power
of language to overwhelm, to jar us out of our comfortable subjectivity,
to move audiences through splendor and revelation rather than rational
persuasion. For Longinus, the sublime "does not persuade; it takes the
reader out of himself \[sic\]" (4[). Sublime language is that in which a
sense of the Real seems to shine through]{.underline}---not the
unassimilable Real itself, but its outline, the enticement that it might
be there even if we cannot capture it. It is artifice, but it evokes
something more, leading us towards the edge of mediation and gesturing
beyond. The sublime operates to conceal a trope "by its very brilliance.
Just as dimmer lights are lost in the surrounding sunshine, so pervading
grandeur all around obscures the presence of the rhetorical devices"
(Longinus 29). Lundberg echoes this concept in his discussion of
repression, arguing that raising one "insular metonymic connection to
the status of a metaphor conceals or renders latent the other metonymic
connections that also inhere in the accreted history of a sign. But [the
condition of this concealment is the whole field of latent connections
that are both accreted and expressed in the social use of
signs]{.underline}" (Lacan in Public 52). Thus the [sublime powerfully
configures the unconscious through repression]{.underline} (in Lacan's
sense) [by concealing the underlying networks of meaning in metonymic
connection by hyperemphasizing one particular link through metaphorical
condensation of meaning]{.underline}. I will argue that this
hyperemphasis comes from the sense of the Real in sublime language, much
as in the Freudian uncanny. As Bataille argues, instrumental language
developed as a function of servile labor, to organize us for meeting
basic needs, and thus only poetic words, limited to the level of
"impotent beauty" can manifest what Bataille calls sovereignty ("Hegel,
Death, and Sacrifice" 16). The rhetorical sublime is an ancient concept,
but in the last few centuries it has been increasingly understood as a
basically aesthetic attribute. Edmund Burke's famous A Philosophical
Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful and
Immanuel Kant's Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime
and Critique of Judgment discuss the sublime as a reaction to
overwhelming experience, broadening it beyond language, a move that is
also evident in more recent treatments by Jean-François Lyotard and
others (Shaw 9). Although this expanding tradition might usefully extend
the concept beyond written and spoken language, communication scholars
should not surrender the sublime's roots in rhetoric. The sublime for
Longinus was first and foremost an aspect of language best examined with
the tools of rhetoric. In abandoning the sublime as a specifically
rhetorical concept, contemporary rhetorical theorists would be ignoring
a vital counterpart to the persuasive tradition and foregoing an
opportunity to provide their unique and vital perspective. The sublime
does have its opponents. Ned O'Gorman has argued persuasively against
the concept on disciplinary and political grounds. There is a danger, he
writes, in accepting the sublime because it threatens to expand the
purview of rhetoric too far and make the field difficult to define or
defend against rapacious administrators. "How is a rhetoric brought into
its own kept from being lost, memorialized, and monumentalized," he asks
("Longinus" 85). O'Gorman's concern seems to be that the sublime makes
rhetoric all-powerful, vesting language with the ability to force and
overwhelm, and neglecting the more utilitarian tradition identified with
Aristotle's focus on persuasion and its many modern derivatives. [This
and allied criticisms treat the sublime as a style rather than an
attribute of communication and pitch an unnecessary opposition with
persuasion]{.underline}. Rhetorical attention to the sublime need not
replace persuasion, identification, or any other instrumental concern.
But if we focus on these things at the expense of the sublime, we offer
latent support for the irksome popular sense of "rhetoric" as "false,
ornamental words." [The sublime is the sense of truth in language---it
is what beckons beyond our unreliable means of mediation to a Real which
we cannot translate perfectly, but that we nonetheless encounter as the
limit of language]{.underline}. [The sublime should be
understood]{.underline} not as a style of language, as it is sometimes
translated from Longinus, but [as an attribute of
communication]{.underline}, the degree to which it gestures towards
[something beyond mediation]{.underline}. The sublime expands the
purview of rhetoric no more than other approaches that have already
usefully expanded its reach to material objects, practices, and so
forth. Like psychoanalysis, the sublime is not the One Ring of theory:
we do not need to understand it as the sole means of studying the world.
Rather, it is an approach to language, and as the examples discussed in
subsequent chapters show, one that we ignore at our own peril. To worry
that the sublime is dangerous is to conflate the concept with its
practice. It is dangerous. The world is dangerous. We should pay
attention to that fact. To be a critic of media or rhetoric is to be
critical of media and rhetorical artefacts. To acknowledge the sublime
as worthy of study is not to make a normative judgment about its
occurrence, but instead to study how it operates in language. As
communication studies scholars, we should embrace this challenge. It
reveals how important our lines of inquiry are and does not necessitate
that we make everything reducible to communication. Concerned with the
image of rhetoric, O'Gorman asks "Will rhetoric always be seen through a
lack?" ("Longinus" 85). Perhaps the answer to O'Gorman's trypophobia is
yes, as long as it ignores the Real and its influence on the ways we
communicate. Implicit in this argument is the idea that theory should be
bounded---in other words, that it should display its own propriety.
Although the sublime should be recognized as a rhetorical tradition, its
import extends to communication more generally. A kind of materialist
sublime has been developed in Timothy Morton's Hyperobjects. Morton's
treatment of temporality links the sublime to other phenomena such as
climate change and pollution. Material artifacts too can be attempts to
mediate a sublime void that exceeds individual subjects, an approach
consistent with material accounts of communication. The persistence of
radioactive waste over vast periods of time, the monumental architecture
proposed for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or the gorgeous,
otherworldly devastation of a nuclear test crater all mean something
sublime in the sense that they decenter humanity and disrupt the subject
by revealing the vastness of the inhuman. Morton's work suggests that
the sublime does not preclude attention to the material specificity of
mediation and also that those objects play a signifying function that
potentially decenters the human subject. I therefore mean mediation in
the broadest possible sense: the effort to communicate with others,
fated by the discontinuity of our electrical nervous systems to involve
translation, abstraction, symbolization, and reference through media,
which are all of the bridges we try to raise over the chasms of our
separation (Peters 4). Language is the media I focus on the most partly
because its failure is most conspicuous, but it is only one of the
resistors used to make manageable the vast superfluity of meaning. Film,
architecture, television, and simulations are all examples of mediation
in that they attempt to translate human experience and in the process
shape the subjects that they ostensibly serve. [In this sense mediation
is both the effort to communicate and the environment in which we do so.
It is artifice so pervasive that it appears natural.]{.underline} As the
testimony of atomic test witnesses will show, the Bomb itself is a
medium of sublime communication. For some, nuclear explosions roared of
Doomsday and Almighty power, of Armageddon, the Fall, or sin. For
others, perhaps they signal technological hubris, or the confirmation of
a godless universe indifferent to the selfdestructiveness of the
puffed-up apes infesting a tiny isolated rock in the Milky Way. They
might promise eventual human obliteration or change their witnesses'
lives forever. They might suggest perpetual peace. They might not. Even
unexploded, the Bomb is still a currency of meaning constantly in use.
The Soviet footage of weapons on parade that transfixed me as a child is
nothing more than the use of the Bomb-asmedium, remediated through film.
The arcane incantations of nuclear deterrence understand the Bomb as a
means of persuasion: the Bomb convinces another party not to take a
political or military action that it might otherwise take through the
enthymematic hint of slaughter and ruin. Persuasion is not everything,
but it is still important. Still, even nuclear planners recognize that
the Bomb does more than persuade. Along with the more classical
functions of nuclear arsenals, some defense intellectuals use language
uncannily resonant with the sublime in stating that the Bomb's purpose
is not simply to dissuade or deter, but to overawe, something that it
has a unique capacity to do (Oelrich 46). This is the central argument
of this dissertation: the fascination and terror of nuclear destruction
are essentially connected by their perceived reference to an unmediated
Real. Because the Real cannot be perfectly represented, our efforts to
mediate it necessarily fail to completely capture reality, but the
investments that sustain our repeated efforts guarantee that they
continue, for our very beings demand connection with the world and each
other. That efforts to capture the Real do not succeed in that aim is
not to say that they are not productive, that rich array of theoretical
tools in communication studies should be abandoned, or that they are not
important. Indeed, these efforts are quite literally our entire world.
To square our existence as subjects marked off from the totality of the
Real with our desire to experience it without mediation, we come to
enjoy the illusion of control over the presence and absence of the
world, as in Freud's fort-da game. In the nuclear context, [we
repetitively simulate destruction and salvation, worlds without us and
ones made present for our habitation]{.underline}. [Nuclear imaginations
persist]{.underline} after the Cold War [and their various tropes have
metastasized into new apocalyptic imaginations: environmental
destruction, terrorism, pandemics, even zombies]{.underline}. While the
Bomb did not inaugurate apocalyptic fear, [the tropes and habits
developed by its mediation]{.underline} in the intense crucible of the
Cold War **[influence the way these other crises are
mediated]{.underline}**. More fundamentally, the economy of cathectic
investment that animates these cultural assemblages is a product of the
death drive---perhaps unfortunately named because it is not a wish for
death but a wish for unmediated experience evident only in the constant
attempts to mediate that same experience. As that drive has
communication at its core, [the tools of communication studies are the
appropriate means to study it and the various discourses, material
practices, and technological artifices that arise from its
operation.]{.underline} To do so might reveal much about communication
itself, along with the limits and possibilities of how we respond
politically to the threat of human extinction. I do not intend to create
a complete, self-contained system to schematize the Real. Such a thing
is impossible because the Real is by definition that which escapes
symbolic assimilation. In suggesting that the Real is the intrusion of
the non-human world into the symbolic network of the social, I aim to
explore [how the perceived limits of communication inform what
discourses develop to explain and order nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
This project [should instill skepticism about the efficacy of current
strategies meant to confront nuclear violence by challenging it
discursively]{.underline}. A great deal of work about the Bomb,
following Carol Cohn's excellent article and the germinal work of
Stephen Hilgartner, Richard C. Bell and Rory O\'Connor in Nukespeak, has
focused on the sanitizing effects of nuclear language. Barry Brummett,
Daniel Zins, and Edward Schiappa have all published work in this vein.
Schiappa criticizes terms like "Strategic Defense Initiative" and
CORRTEX for "bureaucratizing" and "domesticating" nuclear issues.
Through these verbal strategies, nuclear realities are "insulated from
public inspection by acronyms or sanitized jargon" (253). Both Barry
Brummett and Charles Kauffman use the work of Kenneth Burke to argue
that naming practices constrain public knowledge and influence attitudes
about nuclear weapons, either through perfecting "God terms" for
Brummett or through reference appealing historical myths such as the
American frontier for Kauffman (Brummett, 1989; Kauffman, 1990). Even
David Cratis Williams, who combines a Derridean perspective to the more
familiar Burke, emphasizes that a chief goal of nuclear criticism is a
"publicly accessible" language (Williams 202). These are all advocates
for what we might call the concealment thesis. The basic assumption for
proponents of this idea is that nuclear terminology conceals the reality
of nuclear warfare and thus makes it palatable. The nuclear thinking
developed by RAND game theorists and others produced an arcane
vocabulary for all aspects of nuclear conflict, much as academia has for
its own concerns: "counterforce targeting," "throw-weight," "circular
error probable," "post-attack state," and, of course, "countervalue" and
"first strike." These terms mystify and enchant the public, just as they
did public intellectuals during the Cold War, the fictional narrator of
End Zone, and legions of high school and college undergraduate debaters
to this very day (myself included). The theories of language used in the
concealment thesis draw from different sources (Burke, Derrida, and
Aristotle, Orwell, just to name a few), but [their least common
denominator is a belief that nuclear metaphors and euphemism sustain the
complex of nuclear destruction **by concealing the horror of nuclear
war**]{.underline}. [The implication of this idea is that providing a
new vocabulary for public debate]{.underline}, such as the "devil terms"
Brummett suggests, **[would enable democratic deliberation and therefore
constrain the nuclear state.]{.underline}** As Schiappa puts it, **[a
"negative nukespeak would consist of linguistic strategies to portray
nuclear weapons and war as dangerous and immoral]{.underline}**" (268).
**[Such a strategy might "salvage" debate over nuclear weapons in the
public sphere]{.underline}** (Schiappa 254[). Even outside communication
studies, there is a broad consensus amongst critics of nuclear weapons
that democratic debate is the key method for resistance to nuclear
weapons and that concealing language stands as a barrier to
it.]{.underline} [Nuclear critique of all kinds has dropped off
considerably]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War such that the
concealment thesis, although advanced most comprehensively in the 1980s,
remains the chief contribution of communication studies to the politics
of nuclear warfare. The central argument of this book suggests that this
legacy needs revision. The economy of nuclear discourse since the day of
Trinity has been driven by the attempt to get closer to the Real, to
have the Bomb as it "really is." Chapter 2 will suggest that nuclear
simulations were presented as more real and more rational than the
Doomsday imaginations of Curtis LeMay and the early Strategic Air
Command. Jonathan Schell's Fate of the Earth was another effort to bring
Americans face-to-face with the reality of nuclear war, as were the more
explicitly fictional novels churned out especially in the 1950s, 1960s,
and 1980s. Underlying these efforts is the fact that nuclear war remains
"fabulously textual" in Derrida's terms (24-27). Th[ere have been
atrocities related to nuclear weapons and their production---indigenous
peoples subjected to uranium mining and nuclear testing, inner city
populations confined and targeted in the name of the Bomb, "downwinders"
exposed to radioactivity, U.S. soldiers made to witness tests with
inadequate protection, and non-human animals subjected to cruelty in the
name of understanding just what a nuclear war might be
like]{.underline}. [But there has never been a nuclear war in the sense
that strategists, novelists, and survivalists imagined it. To imagine
the graphic details of a possible nuclear war does not reveal the truth
but instead relies on the same dynamic that makes the Bomb so
fascinating in the first place: a sense of access to the
Real]{.underline}. My overall aim is to establish the death drive as a
problematic for communication studies. I argue that it is a desire for
unmediated experience spurred on by the Real, but because communication
is always mediated, this desire is frustrated as soon as it is
expressed. The quest for the Real ends up mired in the Symbolic. [Unable
to enjoy the Real because its loss is the necessary condition for
subjectivity in the first place, we invest in subjectivity instead,
enjoying the perceived control over presence and absence demonstrated in
the fort-da dynamic]{.underline}. In developing this argument, I hope to
make a contribution to communication studies by showing that silence,
omission, and lack do not just frustrate our effort to communicate, but
partly determine the ways in which we do so. These unspeakable failures
are not therefore purely negative---they are an excess beyond language,
not a vacuum. Specific media artefacts, whether war games or literary
texts, exist instead of others because they are animated by desire and
the uncanny sense of the Real. Therefore, [efforts to understand what we
do communicate require attention to the larger economy of desire and
that which we cannot mediate]{.underline}. For rhetoric, [this means a
new understanding of the sublime as an uncanny attribute of signifiers
and media itself in relation to the Real, rather than simply a grand
style of speech]{.underline}. For media and technology studies, it means
acknowledging how the enjoyment of our power over presence and absence
leads us to form attachments that sustain some particular technologies
instead of others, making an account of desire necessary even for a
truly materialist understanding of mediation. **[This also means
rethinking the relationship between public discourse and political
change since]{.underline}**, as the example of nuclear weapons shows,
**[horror and fascination are woven together such that exposing the
potential for catastrophe does not translate into an effective
response.]{.underline}**

As Chapter 2 **[argued, the abstract reasoning of nuclear war is
inherently problematic because it is an attempt to calculate the
incalculable]{.underline}**. As Michael Dillon writes[, this is also the
necessary condition for the devaluation of populations in the modern age
and their exposure to the kind of risks posed by nuclear
war]{.underline}. [The attempt to make life commensurate and calculable
is another attempt to mediate something that exceeds our ability to
express]{.underline}---the very purpose and importance of human
existence, [the central value of life that nuclear war brings starkly
into question by forcing us to imagine a world in which we are
destroyed]{.underline}. To respond to this possibility by articulating
the value of life in tradable units, i.e., to claim that we can
"rationally" determine the necessity to risk one part of the population
on behalf of another, makes it possible to obviate the value of some
lives entirely. "There is nothing abstract about this," Dillon writes.
"\[T[\]he declension of economies of value **leads to the zero point of
holocaust...\[**systems of value\] run the risk of counting out the
invaluable]{.underline}. Counted out, the invaluable may then lose its
purchase on life. Herewith, then, the necessity of championing the
invaluable itself. For we must never forget that, 'we are dealing always
with whatever exceeds measure'" (165). [Rational calculation makes life
capable of being devalued entirely, and therefore the triumph of reason
results in the kind of "bare life" for which there is no
recourse.]{.underline} It can be killed but not sacrificed. The details
of countervalue targeting seem to confirm this overall trajectory. Held
vulnerable to a Soviet attack, [the urban American population could be
killed by anyone]{.underline}, even the USSR, [because the calculation
of the value of potential lives lost in a nuclear war made risk
acceptable, and thus exposed them to risk]{.underline}. The attempt to
calculate the incalculable depersonalized some (urban) populations,
trading cities as abstract pieces in an hypothetical, simulated exchange
with the Soviet Union. This dynamic mirrors the move between
incalculable, excessive Real and mediated, reclaiming Symbolic. [All
populations are not equally exposed to risk]{.underline}, however.
[While the general principle of utilitarianism that underpins the
calculation of lives should treat them all as equal, in practice some
populations are more disposable than others]{.underline}. The
[characteristics of conditionally-sacrificed peoples were not erased.
Thus the underlying dynamic of failed and feigned reality described here
previously has been manifested in culturallyspecific ways.]{.underline}
Repeated investments accrete into durable formations, but those
formations then channel how further investments are made. A number of
examples exist for the link between sacrifice, space and violence.
Following from Heidegger's essay "The Age of the World Picture," Rey
Chow argues that we are now in the "Age of the World Target," in which
foreign spaces are known and mapped in order to be attacked[. In "the
wake of the atomic bombs]{.underline}," Chow writes, "the [world has
come to be grasped and conceived as a target---to be destroyed as soon
as it can be made visible]{.underline}" (12). Chow implicates area
studies and Western "theory" broadly, including post-structuralism,
literary theory, and a range of other pursuits broadly originating in
European or EuroAmerican culture. Area studies in particular serves as a
vehicle to know the world and thus reduce it to the target, promising
destruction as the inevitable result. Chow does sometimes write about
difference in general terms, and mentions a few domestic concerns and
anxieties about the limit of U.S. borders (42-43). Nevertheless, [her
focus is primarily on how the United States imagines enemies outside its
own territory and how xenophobia results in violence against
them.]{.underline}

[The Bomb is not God, but its atomic structure was close enough to be
incorporated in God's place.]{.underline} Newly ingested, [it summoned
the void that is a surfeit of reality without the need for human beings;
the world without us. Fit into the place of God, it could be understood
and made to serve the same purposes, its otherworldly power beyond
mediation now mediated, although not without its inevitable distortions.
Sublime language is a kind of catachresis, an abuse of language to cover
up something monstrous, but it works precisely because it never does so
completely]{.underline}, just as the mutant cells caused by radioactive
exposure do not seamlessly restore the body to its prior state. For Paul
de Man, catachresis is the figure of "mixed modes," capable of inventing
the most fantastic entitites by dint of the positional power inherent in
language. [They can dismember the texture of reality and reassemble it
in the most capricious of ways...Something monstrous lurks in the most
innocent of catachresis: when one speaks of the legs of the table or the
face of the mountain, catachresis is already turning into prosopopeia,
and one begins to perceive a world of potential ghosts and
monsters]{.underline}. (19) Swords and Plowshares [As awareness of the
Bomb spread, the weapon was treated ever more as a vengeful
God.]{.underline} Theologian Wilbur Smith, one of the first to write
systematically about religion and nuclear weapons, noted that "[writers
seemed forced" to turn to Biblical language to describe the atomic test
in New Mexico and the world it gave rise to]{.underline} (44). Smith's
declaration that "the next D-Day will be doomsday, unless men turn to
God" (307) was perhaps the first in a long line of statements tying the
Bomb to Biblical prophecy, the most notable being Hal Lindsey's The Late
Great Planet Earth and Billy Graham's various proclamations on the
topic. There is a certain smugness in Smith's book directed towards all
of those who dismissed the literal truth of the Revelation of John:
finally, they will be forced to see the light, as it were, and pay for
their obstinance. Much has been written of the apocalyptic fervor for
the end times and the desire to hasten their coming in the form of
nuclear war (Knelman, passim). David Noble argues that [this treatment
of the Bomb is contiguous with a larger metaphysics of technology that
sees progress on Earth as a product of divine guidance. Technology is a
means of transcending this Earthly life, and thus some desire even for
nuclear war fits the pattern of techno-theology]{.underline} (Noble
3-13). [The Bomb made a world-ending Armageddon a literal possibility,
and thus made possible beliefs like those of Claire Schaus, who declared
the coming of a new "Atomic God" with the Bomb as its "Hand," exceeding
humankind and demanding reverence]{.underline} (Schaus 30-4, 123). In
the last decade it has come to light that Air Force ethics training for
launch officers relied until quite recently on explicitly apocalyptic
Christian themes and Biblical interpretation, including a training
session called the "Jesus loves nukes speech" by its participants
(Leopold). [The God-like assimilation of nuclear weapons has even given
them a transcendence of time beyond what William Laurence named the
"Atomic Age." The Bomb's reign over the future is most evident in
Jonathan Schell's Fate of the Earth, which argued that its threat to
future generations made it of infinite importance]{.underline} (the
implications of this argument will be discussed more fully in Chapter
2). The discourse of the Bomb also gives it dominion over the past,
however. [The most striking difference between God and the Bomb---that
one is supposed to predate and give rise to humanity, while the other is
itself a human creation---has been somewhat erased.]{.underline} A
number of Internet prophecy and conspiracy websites have espoused the
Ancient Nuclear War Theory, choosing Atlantis (sometimes A-Tlan-Tis in
the Great Lakes region of modern North America), the lost continent of
Mu, Sodom, Gomorrah, or the Indus Valley as past targets of nuclear
warfare, sometimes citing Robert Oppenheimer as a supposed advocate.
This theory has exploded on the Internet with the help of David Hatcher
Childress's 2000 book Technology of the Gods: the Incredible Sciences of
the Ancients and the earlier work of Erich von Däniken. The History
Channel, a masterwork of euphemistic naming, has given a platform to
these ideas, which also appear in fiction like Battlestar Galactica. In
Ancient Atom Bombs: Fact, Fraud, and the Myth of Prehistoric Nuclear
Warfare, Jason Colavito argues that this theory is a response to modern
anxieties about extinction from the atom bomb, providing both a morality
tale and a promise that this horrific technology can be survived (23).
The theory also serves to naturalize the Bomb by moving it beyond the
limits of recorded history, assimilating its disruptive appearance into
a scheme reserved for God, now represented in a secularized narrative.
The work of John Brandenbug, a physicist who argues that nuclear war
might have eliminated past life on Mars, moves the Bomb from before
recorded history to before humanity itself (Brandenburg). Here [the Bomb
becomes akin to Quentin Meillasoux's arche-fossil, a reminder of ancient
time that dislocates humanity from the center of the
universe]{.underline} (Meillasoux, ch. 1). [This trait gave the Bomb a
special sense of access to the Real, just as God was once more commonly
afforded.]{.underline} The Bomb was also tasked with answering prayers
for earthly salvation. The best known were those for smiting the enemy.
Nuclear strategy in the 1940s and early 1950s did not go far beyond what
Curtis LeMay termed the "Sunday punch," an unrestrained and potentially
world-ending nuclear conflagration. A huge array of weapons was created
in the first decades of the Cold War, from impractically enormous Soviet
Tsar Bomba to the impractically small "nuclear bazooka" called the Davy
Crockett. Even more were dreamed of. In one proposed scheme called
Project A119, the United States would detonate a nuclear explosive on
the moon, ostensibly for scientific purposes (Reiffel). In another
scheme, reported by Popular Science, U.S. troops would be equipped with
"Atomic Six-Shooters" to police the Cold War frontier, firearms loaded
with californium bullets ("From a Shocking New Book" 180). Fever dreams
of the Bomb's salvific power reached their peak in Project Plowshare.
Plowshare was the brainchild of Edward Teller, hardline anti-Communist
and inventor of the hydrogen bomb (Kirsch 3). The program was intended
to prove the feasibility of nuclear earthmoving, using hydrogen bombs to
"change the earth's surface to suit us," in Teller's words (Kirsch 3).
The possibilities of "peaceful nuclear explosions" were first discussed
following the Suez Crisis in 1956, when engineers contemplated
excavating a second Suez Canal through Israeli territory. Later, schemes
for another Panama Canal received Congressional funding (Kirsch 148).
Serious efforts were made to study the feasibility of creating a new
deepwater port in Alaska, and a few nuclear tests were done in the
Southwest. Teller co-authored a textbook about the opportunities for
PNEs which ranged from space exploration, reservoir construction, and
highway clearing to oil and natural gas development, meteorological
studies, chemical production and mining (Teller et al.). Plowshare was
justified as a project for the creation and accumulation of mineral and
commercial wealth, a way to unlock the earth's resources and facilitate
global trade to overcome scarcity. The program's name itself is
presumably drawn from Isaiah 2:4, which in the King James Version reads:
"And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and
they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more." One chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission argued that God himself willed that humanity unlock the
peaceful potential of the atom, and in fact our destruction was
impossible due to divine providence (Seife 60). Teller's own promise to
"change the earth's surface to suit us" evokes a similar power which
again allows the Bomb to work in geological timescales rather than human
ones to change the Earth forever. Even Nobel Prize winner Willard Libby
embraced this vision, hoping to "move mountains," and guarantee
prosperity for all humankind (Kirsch 38-39). Although these promises
appear to have been earnestly believed by at least some Plowshare
supporters, the program was also a cover for "clean" weapons development
(Seife 68-72). Plowshare was supposed to allow nuclear testing as an
exception to test ban treaties, and with it the development of
low-fallout bombs for use against the Soviet Union. "Cleaner" bombs
reduce the barriers to nuclear use and allow territory to be safely
occupied with greater speed (Makhijani and Zerriffi 2-3). The fact that
both warfighting and development goals were united in one program should
not be a surprise: both atomic destruction and the remolding of the
earth signal divine power, and human mastery over these forces provides
some connection to that promise. Even the program's title contains a
hint, for the Bible contains another reference to plowshares besides
Isaiah in Joel 3:10: "Beat your plowshares into swords and your
pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong." Although the
Soviets balked at the program and fallout concerns undermined it, the
idea of "civilian" nuclear explosions did not stop. The USSR itself
eventually blasted out Lake Chagan with a nuclear bomb. Schemes to use
the Bomb for good still occasionally surface. When the Deepwater Horizon
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caught world attention in 2010, Russian
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda suggested that a nuclear detonation could
solve the problem as it apparently had several times in the Soviet Union
(Weinstein). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Hurricane Research Division felt compelled to explain why nuclear
detonations are not simple solutions to hurricane formation---apparently
a "frequently-asked question" (Landsea). If all else fails, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration is still upbeat about the Bomb as a
means of saving humanity from asteroids. NASA found that it would be the
"most effective alternative" to deal with a "threatening object" in the
"likely range of threats over million-year timescales" (NASA 15). [A
messianic discourse of "infinite energy" surrounds fusion power and was
sometimes used by the National Ignition Facility, even though that
program too (and inertial confinement fusion more generally) is probably
a cover for weapons developmen]{.underline}t (Makhijani and Zerriffi).
[The tie between peaceful justification for nuclear explosive research
and more aggressive weapons development illustrates a larger process of
desire.]{.underline} George Bataille argued that the discontinuity of
the subject from the indistinct flow of matter and energy that composes
the universe is the basis for accumulation and with it, work. [Human
beings are those who resist the loss and decay of nature, seeking to
create a bulwark against death which is itself only meaningful when the
subject is separated from continuity. In the purposeless waste and
consumption of nature, accumulation is a product of the human
"No"]{.underline} (Bataille, Erotism 61-62). This is also the basis for
Bataille's distinction between general and specific economies. The
general economy, considered as "the totality of productive wealth on the
surface of the globe," has an excess of energy: there is always more
than can be put to productive use. Some loss is inescapable. Human
societies, however, operate in terms of a particular economy---a system
carved out from the general, fighting a vicious but losing battle of
accumulation against loss (Accursed Share 22-23). The drives for
eroticism and death for Bataille are the same in that they are both
desires for continuity. Neither is "productive," which is the origin of
taboos against them: to preserve the discontinuous, local, particular
economy from the continuous, undifferentiated, general economy. [Excess
is regulated by a taboo, but the taboo itself is maintained by
transgression. Small transgressions allow subjects to indulge their
desire without bringing society down with them, and their actions are
made more enjoyable precisely because they are officially
forbidden.]{.underline} The Plowshare dream is essentially an embrace of
artifice in the grandest way--- human designs would reshape nature
itself to bring it into conformity with the demands of the social[. The
"world without us" would be transformed into a "world for us," that even
long after our extinction (made far less likely by these changes) would
continue operating according to the codes we had put in place. This is
accumulation for the propagation of the social order, but it is done
with a weapon that heralds death, decay, poison, even human
extinction]{.underline}. In this light, the seeming contradictions of
someone like Edward Teller dissolve: the H-Bomb and Plowshare are linked
by the taboo uniting continuity and discontinuity and the transgressive
Bomb that allows passage between the two. The [Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), primary legal embodiment of
the taboo against nuclear weapon use, asserted an "inalienable right" to
peaceful nuclear explosives, even outlawing price gouging on future
projects]{.underline} (International Atomic Energy Agency 3). [Nuclear
states could thus enjoy the numinous power of the Bomb free of guilt,
justifying it as an accumulative technology rather than a disintegrating
weapon.]{.underline} Contingency [Nuclear weapons testing, including
Trinity and Plowshare, calls for an expanded understanding of the
sublime. The Real is the manifest failure of communication which is
revealed by the eruption of unassimilable excess. Its revelation
decenters the subject by revealing the artifice of our reality and the
inability of its order-scripting functions to overcome completely the
contingency of the world-without-us.]{.underline} We live day-t0-day in
a reality that we have constructed for ourselves in concert with others,
passed between us by various forms of mediation. [Most of the time, this
reality "works" so efficiently that we do not have to be aware of it. We
can treat artifice as nature and misrecognize the Symbolic as the Real.
Events like Trinity burst the seams of this reality and force us to
confront the fact that it is ultimately artificial. This can inspire a
sense of vertigo, even terror, as we are suddenly confronted with the
presence of a much vaster world that exceeds our ability to capture it
entirely and translate it amongst ourselves in language. Our concerns
seem small indeed when compared to the unimaginable vastness and energy
of the cosmos as revealed in the Bomb. We do try to mediate our
experience nonetheless. Confronting the Real certainly produces a crop
of true nihilists, but for the most part, we try to stitch our fabric
back together. At the same time, we value truth. Symbolic communication
works because we agree that certain signifiers are linked to certain
signifieds and not others, despite the network of metaphor and metonymy
that keeps the whole scheme running.6 Some tropes serve as more powerful
links in this network than others, and the sense of the Real---really,
the outline of the lack---is why. This is the uncanny aspect of language
that allows specific tropes to serve as sites of cathexis. The Bomb is a
powerful locus for investment because it stands in for something beyond
language, even beyond our ability to imagine. This sense cannot be
imparted directly, because by its nature, it is in excess of our ability
to mediate, but language can act as currency until it reaches that final
limit where it is exposed as inadequate. The sublime character of
language is its uncanny capacity to be understood as the Real even
though it is the fate of discontinuous beings to cathect to the Symbolic
as if it were the (unreachable) Real which remains unspoken. The Bomb
occupies a metaphysical position as a force, sometimes with its own
agency ascribed to it, which makes the Real palatable by implying some
structure to it where nonesuch exists.]{.underline} 6 This "agreement"
does not have to take the form of a formal pact. [Part of desire is its
mimetic quality, where we desire a certain object because others desire
it---or rather, because we believe that they do. Its importance in the
broader economy of the Symbolic marks it as a target for the desire of
the Other. Thus something can become important despite the lack of any
inherent worth simply because "desire is the desire of the
Other,"]{.underline} as Lacan puts it (Anxiety 22). [This again reflects
a relationship between order and contingency---the tropes that serve as
loci for investment and are therefore made durable can be the products
of anarchic investments. This implied structure is
important.]{.underline} Psychoanalysis has been criticized by critics
such as Andrew Robinson who have argued that contemporary psychoanalysis
scholarship reasserts an unjustifiable division between representation
and reality, ultimately "rigging the game" by positing an agential Real
that guarantees the failure of mediation and authorizes claims about the
subject's "lack" which flow from the assertion of a category rather than
fine-grained analysis of context. The unearned theoretical benefits of
this dualism are several: having declared in advance that mediation
fails, it is an easy task to make claims about the subject based on that
failure. If the Real cannot be assimilated into representation, then the
concept provides a convenient means to explain away discrepancies and
failures of psychoanalysis itself while still providing what is
ultimately a deterministic, structuralist explanation for the world---an
active Real that accounts for perceived reality through a set of
automatic operations that compose an invisible "deep structure."
Finally, to posit a "beyond" of mediation insulates one from criticism
since the Real cannot be discussed directly, what Robinson calls (after
Judith Butler) a "theological" project (Robinson). Robinson's argument
should caution us against a reading of the Real as the "deep structure"
of reality that determines it in its entirety. An understanding of the
Real as the contingent eruption of non-human reality into a Symbolic
order that creates the illusion of a human-centered reality avoids this
critique. [The Real is not deep structure with a set of laws that
determine society---or, if indeed it does have a set of laws, they
cannot be determined by us, because they cease to be the Real the moment
this happens. The Real is what is inaccessible. It does impact our
world, but it does so through distortion and disruption, not
determination. The interplay of the Symbolic and the Real is essentially
one of structure versus contingency.]{.underline} The ceaseless work of
automaton scripting order over tuché, mentioned in the Introduction and
explained further in the next chapter, creates a set of rules that might
provide predictable order, but they only appear to be inevitable and
natural. Beneath them is not a deep structure, but an endless void. It
is worth noting that [the Symbolic need not have a permanent structure
either. Constellations of tropes are made durable, but not permanent, by
what Lundberg calls "affective labor" and I have generally referred to
as cathexis. That the belief in determinism persists in some quarters
should not discredit the Real or the drive for unmediated experience
(i.e., the death drive). Instead, it should highlight our tendency to
mistake the durable but artificial structures of the Symbolic for some
metaphysical truth of the Real, just as the Bomb is conflated with
God.]{.underline} This is also why Lacanian psychoanalysis is consistent
with the emerging set of ideas grouped together as speculative realism.
Humanity mistakes its reality for the Real, and is only shocked into
perspective when the latter is revealed by the inadequacy of the former.
As Lacan wrote, [To be a psychoanalyst is simply to open your eyes to
the evident fact that nothing malfunctions more than human
reality...nothing is more stupid than human destiny, that is, that one
is always being fooled. Even when one does do something successfully, it
is precisely not what one wanted to do.]{.underline} (Psychoses 82) The
conflation of Symbolic and Real is at the heart of the Bomb. [Jacques
Derrida famously wrote that nuclear war is "fabulously textual," having
no existence outside of the system of language, which we might broaden
to representation, or better yet, mediation. Derrida argued that because
a total nuclear war has not taken place and its coming would obliterate
the archive, it can exist only in its "essential rhetoricity" as a
"fantasy" or "fable" that has no referent in reality]{.underline}
(Derrida 24-27). Some, like Masahide Kato, have criticized Derrida on
the grounds that nuclear war has taken place in the form of nuclear
testing, part of a larger project of radioactive colonialism and
destruction of indigenous peoples (Kato). I read this argument a
different way. We do not have to deny that a nuclear war is in some
sense ongoing in order to claim that it has never happened. The kind of
nuclear war imagined by Kistiakowsky at Trinity can never come to pass
because it means the end of everything on Earth. The radioactive
destruction of native nations does not qualify as a "total" nuclear war
in the minds of strategists and their peace activist Doppelgängers
because the war they imagine is beyond any material referent, only
hinted at by the presence of the Bomb on Earth. It represents both the
Real in its punishing materiality and a speculation that could not exist
anywhere but the human imagination. [The desire to experience the Real
is therefore bound to be frustrated. The final advent of the Bomb always
seems imminent but is never realized, so obliteration is endlessly
deferred]{.underline}.7 [The desire for the Real described in this
chapter is thus a source of inevitable failure and frustration. But it
is only on part of the death drive. Unable to meet the Real and still
remain extant as discrete subjects, taunted by the continuity that lies
over the line of taboo, our desires remain. We are dislocated and
decentered by the Bomb, but we do not accept our being as dust and
ashes. Instead, the subject desirous of the nuclear Real finds its
enjoyment in the opposite fantasy: one of power over the conditions of
presence and absence, mastery of contingency and the Real itself. This
is the dynamic of Freud's fort-da game, and in context of nuclear war,
it manifests itself in the compulsion to repetitively simulate nuclear
destruction.]{.underline} Atmospheric nuclear testing ended for the USA
in 1963. [Ultimately only a relatively small number of people witnessed
nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, so inevitably awareness and
imagination of the Bomb's overwhelming presence would spread in an
increasingly mediated form. War games as rituals helped to sustain a
nuclear priesthood in its (necessarily incomplete) access to the
revealed truth of the Bomb after the end of atmospheric nuclear testing
left its followers merely longing to "feel the heat." As these
technologies gave form to videogames and ostensibly anti-war
simulations, they would democratize access to the Bomb and
cement]{.underline} its force as an organizing metaphor for the Real.
CHAPTER 2: PLAYING WARGAMES \[W\]ar and business are conflicts
resembling games, and as such, they may be formalized as to constitute
games with definite rules. Indeed, I have no reason to suppose that such
formalized versions of them are not already being established as models
to determine the policies for pressing the Great Push Button and burning
the earth clean for a new and less humanly undependable order of things.
\--Norbert Weiner, God & Golem, Inc. Ipsos Custodes In his "Seminar on
the 'Purloined Letter,'" Jacques Lacan wrote that "it is the symbolic
order which is constitutive for the subject," and that the subject
receives "major determination" from "the itinerary of a signifier" (7).
One is "possessed" by the signifier, a thrall to its agency: "the
[signifier's displacement determines subjects' acts, destiny, refusals,
blindnesses, success, and fate...everything pertaining to the
psychological pregiven follows willy-nilly the signifier's train, like
weapons and baggage]{.underline}" (21). [One doesn't have to adopt a
fully deterministic attitude towards structure to accept that it is the
sign that speaks through us, not vice versa. Human agency does not
operate without restriction, but constitutes a negotiation of rules that
largely prescribe our behaviors.]{.underline} In the itinerary of an
individual life, one can see the influence of accreted structures that
give it form. There is perhaps no better example than that of Vice
Admiral Tim Giardina. Giardina is the former deputy head of the United
States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) at Offutt Air Force Base in
Nebraska, the successor to the Strategic Air Command parodied in Dr.
Strangelove. [In June 2013, Giardina was caught using counterfeit poker
chips at a local casino.]{.underline} It was revealed in the ensuing
investigation that Giardina had spent almost 1,100 hours gambling in an
eighteen-month period. He was such a common sight that other casino
regulars remembered him as "Navy Tim," and recalled comments he had made
about the polygraph requirements for U.S. nuclear forces (he was quoted
as saying that the purpose is really to find out if one is "having sex
with animals or something really crazy"). Giardina was banned from
several casinos but continued to play even after being caught with
counterfeit chips.8 Following an investigation by the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service, he was removed from his post, demoted to Rear
Admiral, and reassigned to Washington (Burns). [It is not illegal for
Navy officers to gamble. Vice Admiral Giardina's habitual compulsion to
play poker did not seem to have any effect on his official duties.
Giardina had to be punished not because his actions are out of line with
the ethos of the Strategic Command, but precisely because they are not.
Giardina enjoyed gambling in poker, but in forging fake chips, he seemed
to enjoy gambling on gambling: his was a kind of "meta-gambling," taking
risks on the rules that regulate risks.]{.underline}9 [In doing so,
Giardina exposed what Slavoj Žižek calls the "obscene supplement" of his
system. Ideological fantasies are maintained by disavowing their
central, obscene foundation, a gesture necessary to the function of the
fantasy but impossible to acknowledge, for the lack of distance would
collapse the whole edifice]{.underline} (Žižek 35-36). [Admiral Cecil
Haney, commander of STRATCOM, said in recent Congressional testimony
that the core mission of the organization remains to deter attack on the
United States.]{.underline} This means 8 Giardina was also reported
smoking cigarette butts scavenged from ashtrays---literally "sifting
through the ashes." 9 The admiral does not appear to have simply needed
more money. He was accused of forging \$2,000 in poker chips, a
relatively small amount, and were he to fail to report excessive debt,
he would have violated policy and the NCIS investigation would have had
clearer grounds to discipline him, which does not appear to have been
the case. minimizing pervasive uncertainty and risk. [In Admiral Haney's
words, "America's nuclear deterrent force provides enduring value to the
nation. It has been a constant thread in the geopolitical fabric of an
uncertain world, providing a moderating influence on generations of
world leaders]{.underline}" (U.S. Senate Comm. on Armed Services,
Statement 7). More directly, it is necessary to identify "where we are
taking risk and where we cannot accept further risk" (U.S. Senate Comm.
on Armed Services, Statement 6). "Risk" and "uncertainty" appear
constantly in Haney's statement, which is a statement for minimizing
chance and developing "contingency plans" to control the consequences of
unforeseen events. [The disturbance of Symbolic order by the contingency
of the Real is met with an attempt to restore order, to respond to
chance with law.]{.underline} Lacan describes this dynamic as the
interplay of tuché and automaton: Where do we meet this real? For what
we have in the discovery of psycho-analysis is an encounter, an
essential encounter---and appointment to which we are always called with
a real that eludes us... First, the tuché, which we have borrowed...from
Aristotle, who uses it in his search for cause. We have translated it as
the encounter with the real. The real is beyond the automaton, the
return, the coming-back, the insistence of the signs, by which we see
ourselves governed by the pleasure principle. The real is that which
always lies behind the automaton...it is this that is the object of
\[Freud's\] concern. (Lacan, Four Fundamental Concepts, 53-54, italics
in original) [This is the central element of the repetition compulsion.
Driven to make our encounter with the Real, we are perpetually
disappointed, but the Symbolic world of reality abhors a vacuum.
Automaton describes the endless attempts to reach the Real which are
doomed to failure but cannot be surrendered, so are repeated again and
again. These repetitive behaviors thus develop an aspect of order, and
are, paradoxically, orderly attempts to reach the chaos of
contingency.]{.underline} They are also linked by Lacan gambling, death,
and signification ("Purloined Letter" 28-29). [Nuclear deterrence can be
read in this frame as an attempt to secure the world against the
contingency of the Real, the uncertainty of nuclear war.]{.underline} It
is the STRATCOM automaton's answer to the chaos of the Bomb's tuché.
[But the attempt to restore order has at its heart a desire to encounter
the Real. In a history of nuclear defense intellectuals, Fred Kaplan
described them in the 1980s at the height of their power having come
with the mission "to impose order," but lacking any means to control the
wild abandon of the Bomb in a hypothetical war for which there was no
precedent, "in the end, chaos still prevailed"]{.underline} (Kaplan
391). [Desire is the motive force, and that what we desire cannot be
attained is what requires repetition. When the chaos of tuché reigns,
automaton does not surrender, but comes to be an end in itself, a site
of investment. Repetition itself becomes enjoyable. In repeatedly
simulating nuclear war, defense intellectuals who could not experience
the Real of nuclear violence could enjoy the illusion of mastery over
the terror and fascination inspired by the Real by appearing to simulate
the conditions of presence and absence---in this case, the presence of
the world-for-us and its absence in the Bomb's inferno.]{.underline}
Langdon Winner distinguishes between risk (a term prevalent in both
nuclear war and poker) and threat or hazard on these grounds: risk
always has an implied benefit to it, an element of desire and an
opportunity for control (145). [There is little empirical basis for
nuclear war simulations and the calculations of probability they rely
on, so nuclear war plans always require a good deal of faith, and thus
to adopt them is a risk---a calculation of both hazard and
reward]{.underline} (Ghamari-Tabrizi 8). [Their parameters are set
arbitrarily by the personnel who design them. In other words, they are
games of chance in which we also manipulate the rules. This is the
obscene supplement of nuclear deterrence that Vice Admiral Giardina
could not be allowed to reveal: we don't just repeat nuclear simulations
again and again because we think that they will someday be
perfect.]{.underline} War games are fun, and we don't always care about
the rules. Poker, after all, was rumored to be the genesis of game
theory at the RAND Corporation, prominent modelers of nuclear war, and
was a favorite pastime of the defense intellectuals who sought to tame
the world with human reason (Arbella 51-53). This chapter will begin
with an exploration of war games as media for access to the Real of
nuclear war and sites of cathexis that permit the subject to enjoy its
discontinuity, using the videogame First Strike as an example of
enjoyment even amongst those who claim to resist the nuclear status quo.
[War games were supposed to model the conduct of war, but they were also
supposed to predict when and how it might occur.]{.underline} John von
Neumann's game theory and Kenneth Arrow's resulting [rational choice
theory, both elaborated at the RAND Corporation, attempted to quantify
human conduct to explain the world.]{.underline} The second part of this
chapter will deal with a problem that arises from attempts to make
decisions based on nuclear war predictions. [Because the Bomb as a
herald of the Real occupies a place beyond rational calculation, the
mathematical language of nuclear war attempts to calculate the
incalculable. The result is a theological impasse which provides
argumentative resources equally to activists and their enemies,
illustrating the unassimilable distortions worked by the contingency of
the Real in the Symbolic attempts to contain it.]{.underline}

#### Thus our alternative is a continued engagement in the sublime where the judge rejects the affimatives reps of nuclearism -- only discourse surrounded by non-mediation solves

It is here that rhetoric usefully supplements the material sense of
mediation understood by Kittler, McLuhan, and others in their camp. One
part of Packer and Crofts Wiley's objection to material rhetoric should
still be parsed out. [Rhetoric may]{.underline} not inevitably impose
the framework of the text, but it [still]{.underline} might
[overemphasize persuasion]{.underline}. A vision of rhetoric as
persuasion exercised within a specific context ultimately describes
operations in Lacan's order of the Imaginary, as opposed to the Real and
the Symbolic (Lundberg, Lacan in Public 39-43). Criticism in this vein
focuses on the content of specific rhetorical expressions and effects at
the cost of a more fundamental explanation of the underlying logic of
the Symbolic which makes specific rhetorical expressions meaningful in
the first place. In Lundberg's words, "fetishizing persuasion as the
primary means of rhetoric's effectivity draws rhetoric's attention away
from the functions of trope and investment that constitute the subject
and its discourses" (Lacan in Public 184). It is as if, given an
equation with a variable X, we focus all of our attention debating over
what value we should assign to the variable at the expense of examining
the equation itself. Persuasion is enabled by an economy of affect that
provides the resources and structure for meaning to be expressed in any
given act. In other words, [every text, artefact, or sign related to
nuclear weapons is a trope interpretable only with reference to a larger
system of arbitrary tropes, a system held together by our repeated
investments in the connections that bind it]{.underline}. There is an
alternative tradition in rhetoric that might help address the broader
ecology of desire that underpins nuclear war, one at least as ancient as
Aristotle's famous emphasis on the means of persuasion. The sublime,
best explained by Longinus but with roots that precede Socrates, has to
do with the power of language to overwhelm, to jar us out of our
comfortable subjectivity, to move audiences through splendor and
revelation rather than rational persuasion. For Longinus, the sublime
"does not persuade; it takes the reader out of himself \[sic\]" (4).
[Sublime language is that in which a sense of the Real seems to shine
through---not the unassimilable Real itself, but its outline, the
enticement that it might be there even if we cannot capture
it]{.underline}. It is artifice, but it evokes something more, leading
us towards the edge of mediation and gesturing beyond. The sublime
operates to conceal a trope "by its very brilliance. Just as dimmer
lights are lost in the surrounding sunshine, so pervading grandeur all
around obscures the presence of the rhetorical devices" (Longinus 29).
Lundberg echoes this concept in his discussion of repression, arguing
that raising one "insular metonymic connection to the status of a
metaphor conceals or renders latent the other metonymic connections that
also inhere in the accreted history of a sign. But the condition of this
concealment is the whole field of latent connections that are both
accreted and expressed in the social use of signs" (Lacan in Public 52).
[Thus the sublime powerfully configures the unconscious through
repression]{.underline} (in Lacan's sense) [by concealing the underlying
networks of meaning in metonymic connection by hyperemphasizing one
particular link through metaphorical condensation of
meaning]{.underline}. I will argue that this hyperemphasis comes from
the sense of the Real in sublime language, much as in the Freudian
uncanny. As Bataille argues, [instrumental language developed as a
function of servile labor]{.underline}, to organize us for meeting basic
needs, and thus only poetic words, [limited to the level of "impotent
beauty" can manifest what Bataille calls sovereignty]{.underline}
("Hegel, Death, and Sacrifice" 16). The rhetorical sublime is an ancient
concept, but in the last few centuries it has been increasingly
understood as a basically aesthetic attribute. Edmund Burke's famous A
Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and
Beautiful and Immanuel Kant's Observations on the Feeling of the
Beautiful and Sublime and Critique of Judgment discuss the sublime as a
reaction to overwhelming experience, broadening it beyond language, a
move that is also evident in more recent treatments by Jean-François
Lyotard and others (Shaw 9). Although this expanding tradition might
usefully extend the concept beyond written and spoken language,
communication scholars should not surrender the sublime's roots in
rhetoric. The sublime for Longinus was first and foremost an aspect of
language best examined with the tools of rhetoric. [In abandoning the
sublime as a specifically rhetorical concept, contemporary rhetorical
theorists would be ignoring a vital counterpart to the persuasive
tradition and foregoing an opportunity to provide their unique and vital
perspective]{.underline}. The sublime does have its opponents. Ned
O'Gorman has argued persuasively against the concept on disciplinary and
political grounds. There is a danger, he writes, in accepting the
sublime because it threatens to expand the purview of rhetoric too far
and make the field difficult to define or defend against rapacious
administrators. "How is a rhetoric brought into its own kept from being
lost, memorialized, and monumentalized," he asks ("Longinus" 85).
O'Gorman's concern seems to be that the sublime makes rhetoric
all-powerful, vesting language with the ability to force and overwhelm,
and neglecting the more utilitarian tradition identified with
Aristotle's focus on persuasion and its many modern derivatives. **[This
and allied criticisms treat the sublime as a style rather than an
attribute of communication and pitch an unnecessary opposition with
persuasion]{.underline}**. Rhetorical attention to the sublime need not
replace persuasion, identification, or any other instrumental concern[.
But if we focus on these things at the expense of the sublime, we offer
latent support for the irksome popular sense of "rhetoric" as "false,
ornamental words]{.underline}." [The sublime is the sense of truth in
language---it is what beckons beyond our unreliable means of mediation
to a Real]{.underline} which we cannot translate perfectly, but that we
nonetheless encounter as the limit of language. The sublime should be
understood not as a style of language, as it is sometimes translated
from Longinus, but as an attribute of communication, the degree to which
it gestures towards something beyond mediation. The sublime expands the
purview of rhetoric no more than other approaches that have already
usefully expanded its reach to material objects, practices, and so
forth. Like psychoanalysis, [the sublime is]{.underline} not the One
Ring of theory: we do not need to understand it as the sole means of
studying the world. Rather, it is [an approach to language]{.underline},
and as the examples discussed in subsequent chapters show, [one that we
ignore at our own peril]{.underline}. **[To worry that
the]{.underline}** **[sublime is dangerous is to conflate the concept
with its practice. It is dangerous]{.underline}**. The world is
dangerous. We should pay attention to that fact. To be a critic of media
or rhetoric is to be critical of media and rhetorical artefacts. To
acknowledge the sublime as worthy of study is not to make a normative
judgment about its occurrence, but instead to study how it operates in
language. **[As communication studies scholars, we should embrace this
challenge]{.underline}**. It reveals how important our lines of inquiry
are and does not necessitate that we make everything reducible to
communication. Concerned with the image of rhetoric, O'Gorman asks "Will
rhetoric always be seen through a lack?" ("Longinus" 85). Perhaps the
answer to O'Gorman's trypophobia is yes, as long as it ignores the Real
and its influence on the ways we communicate. Implicit in this argument
is the idea that theory should be bounded---in other words, that it
should display its own propriety. Although [the sublime should be
recognized as a rhetorical tradition, its import extends to
communication more generally]{.underline}. **[A]{.underline}** kind of
**[materialist sublime has been developed]{.underline}** in Timothy
Morton's Hyperobjects. Morton's treatment of temporality links the
sublime to other phenomena such as climate change and pollution.
Material artifacts too can be attempts to mediate a sublime void that
exceeds individual subjects, an approach consistent with material
accounts of communication. The persistence of radioactive waste over
vast periods of time, the monumental architecture proposed for the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant, or the gorgeous, otherworldly devastation of a
nuclear test crater all mean something sublime in the sense that they
decenter humanity and disrupt the subject by revealing the vastness of
the inhuman. Morton's work suggests that [the sublime does not preclude
attention to the material specificity of mediation and also that those
objects play a signifying function that potentially decenters the human
subject]{.underline}. I therefore mean mediation in the broadest
possible sense: the effort to communicate with others, fated by the
discontinuity of our electrical nervous systems to involve translation,
abstraction, symbolization, and reference through media, which are all
of the bridges we try to raise over the chasms of our separation (Peters
4). Language is the media I focus on the most partly because its failure
is most conspicuous, but it is only one of the resistors used to make
manageable the vast superfluity of meaning. Film, architecture,
television, and simulations are all examples of mediation in that they
attempt to translate human experience and in the process shape the
subjects that they ostensibly serve. In this sense mediation is both the
effort to communicate and the environment in which we do so. It is
artifice so pervasive that it appears natural. As the testimony of
atomic test witnesses will show, **[the Bomb itself is a medium of
sublime communication]{.underline}**. For some, nuclear explosions
roared of Doomsday and Almighty power, of Armageddon, the Fall, or sin.
For others, perhaps they signal technological hubris, or the
confirmation of a godless universe indifferent to the
selfdestructiveness of the puffed-up apes infesting a tiny isolated rock
in the Milky Way. [They might promise eventual human obliteration or
change their witnesses' lives forever. They might suggest perpetual
peace. They might not]{.underline}. Even unexploded, **[the Bomb is
still a currency of meaning constantly in use]{.underline}**. The Soviet
footage of weapons on parade that transfixed me as a child is nothing
more than the use of the Bomb-asmedium, remediated through film. **[The
arcane incantations of nuclear deterrence understand the Bomb as a means
of persuasion: the Bomb convinces another party not to take a political
or military action that it might otherwise take through the enthymematic
hint of slaughter and ruin]{.underline}**. Persuasion is not everything,
but it is still important. Still, even nuclear planners recognize that
the Bomb does more than persuade. Along with the more classical
functions of nuclear arsenals, some [defense intellectuals use language
uncannily resonant with the sublime in stating that the Bomb's purpose
is not simply to dissuade or deter, but to overawe, something that it
has a unique capacity to do]{.underline} (Oelrich 46). This is the
central argument of this dissertation: [the fascination and terror of
nuclear destruction are essentially connected by their perceived
reference to an unmediated Real. Because the Real cannot be perfectly
represented, our efforts to mediate it necessarily fail to completely
capture reality, but the investments that sustain our repeated efforts
guarantee that they continue, for our very beings demand connection with
the world and each other]{.underline}. That efforts to capture the Real
do not succeed in that aim is not to say that they are not productive,
that [rich array of theoretical tools in communication studies should be
abandoned,]{.underline} or that they are not important. Indeed, these
efforts are quite literally our entire world. To square our existence as
subjects marked off from the totality of the Real with our desire to
experience it without mediation, we come to enjoy the illusion of
control over the presence and absence of the world, as in Freud's
fort-da game. In the nuclear context, we repetitively simulate
destruction and salvation, worlds without us and ones made present for
our habitation. [Nuclear imaginations persist after the Cold War and
their various tropes have metastasized into new apocalyptic
imaginations: environmental destruction, terrorism, pandemics, even
zombies]{.underline}. [While the Bomb did not inaugurate apocalyptic
fear, the tropes and habits developed by its mediation in the intense
crucible of the Cold War influence the way these other crises are
mediated]{.underline}. More fundamentally, the economy of cathectic
investment that animates these cultural assemblages is a product of the
death drive---perhaps unfortunately named because it is not a wish for
death but a wish for unmediated experience evident only in the constant
attempts to mediate that same experience. As that drive has
communication at its core, the tools of communication studies are the
appropriate means to study it and the various discourses, material
practices, and technological artifices that arise from its operation. To
do so might reveal much about communication itself, along with the
limits and possibilities of how we respond politically to the threat of
human extinction. I do not intend to create a complete, self-contained
system to schematize the Real. Such a thing is impossible because the
Real is by definition that which escapes symbolic assimilation. In
suggesting that the Real is the intrusion of the non-human world into
the symbolic network of the social**[, I aim to explore how the
perceived limits of communication inform what discourses develop to
explain and order nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. **[This project should
instill skepticism about the efficacy of current strategies meant to
confront nuclear violence by challenging it discursively]{.underline}**.
A great deal of work about the Bomb, following Carol Cohn's excellent
article and the germinal work of Stephen Hilgartner, Richard C. Bell and
Rory O\'Connor in Nukespeak, has focused on the sanitizing effects of
nuclear language. Barry Brummett, Daniel Zins, and Edward Schiappa have
all published work in this vein. Schiappa criticizes terms like
"Strategic Defense Initiative" and CORRTEX for "bureaucratizing" and
"domesticating" nuclear issues. Through these verbal strategies, nuclear
realities are "insulated from public inspection by acronyms or sanitized
jargon" (253). Both Barry Brummett and Charles Kauffman use the work of
Kenneth Burke to argue that naming practices constrain public knowledge
and influence attitudes about nuclear weapons, either through perfecting
"God terms" for Brummett or through reference appealing historical myths
such as the American frontier for Kauffman (Brummett, 1989; Kauffman,
1990). Even David Cratis Williams, who combines a Derridean perspective
to the more familiar Burke, emphasizes that a chief goal of nuclear
criticism is a "publicly accessible" language (Williams 202). These are
all advocates for what we might call the concealment thesis. The basic
assumption for proponents of this idea is that nuclear terminology
conceals the reality of nuclear warfare and thus makes it palatable[.
The nuclear thinking]{.underline} [developed]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} RAND [game theorists]{.underline} and others [produced
an arcane vocabulary for all aspects of nuclear conflict, much as
academia has for its own concerns: "counterforce targeting,"
"throw-weight," "circular error probable," "post-attack state," and, of
course, "countervalue" and "first strike]{.underline}." **[These terms
mystify and enchant the]{.underline}** public, just as they did public
intellectuals during the Cold War, the fictional narrator of End Zone,
and **[legions of high school and college undergraduate debaters to this
very day]{.underline}** (myself included). [The theories of language
used in the concealment thesis draw from different sources]{.underline}
(Burke, Derrida, and Aristotle, Orwell, just to name a few), **[but
their least common denominator is a belief that nuclear metaphors and
euphemism sustain the complex of nuclear destruction by concealing the
horror of nuclear war]{.underline}**. [The implication of this idea is
that providing a new vocabulary for public debate]{.underline}, such as
the "devil terms" Brummett suggests, **[would enable democratic
deliberation and therefore constrain the nuclear state]{.underline}**.
As Schiappa puts it, a "negative nukespeak would consist of linguistic
strategies to portray nuclear weapons and war as dangerous and immoral"
(268). Such a strategy might "salvage" debate over nuclear weapons in
the public sphere (Schiappa 254). Even outside communication studies,
**[there is a broad consensus amongst critics of nuclear weapons that
democratic debate is the key method for resistance to nuclear weapons
and that concealing language stands as a barrier to it. Nuclear critique
of all kinds has dropped off considerably]{.underline}** since the end
of the Cold War such that the concealment thesis, although advanced most
comprehensively in the 1980s, remains the chief contribution of
communication studies to the politics of nuclear warfare. The central
argument of this book suggests that this legacy needs revision. [The
economy of nuclear discourse since the day of Trinity has been driven by
the attempt to get closer to the Real, to have the Bomb as it "really
is]{.underline}." Chapter 2 will suggest that nuclear simulations were
presented as more real and more rational than the Doomsday imaginations
of Curtis LeMay and the early Strategic Air Command. Jonathan Schell's
Fate of the Earth was another effort to bring Americans face-to-face
with the reality of nuclear war, as were the more explicitly fictional
novels churned out especially in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s.
[Underlying these efforts is the fact that nuclear war remains
"fabulously textual]{.underline}" in Derrida's terms (24-27). [There
have been atrocities related to nuclear weapons]{.underline} and their
production---**[indigenous peoples subjected to uranium mining and
nuclear testing, inner city populations confined and targeted in the
name of the Bomb, "downwinders" exposed to radioactivity, U.S. soldiers
made to witness tests with inadequate protection, and non-human animals
subjected to cruelty in the name of understanding just what a nuclear
war might be like.]{.underline}** [But there has never been a nuclear
war in the sense that strategists, novelists, and survivalists imagined
it]{.underline}. [To imagine the graphic details]{.underline} of a
possible nuclear war does not reveal the truth but instead [relies on
the same dynamic that makes the Bomb so fascinating in the first
place]{.underline}: a sense of access to the Real. My overall aim is to
establish the death drive as a problematic for communication studies. [I
argue that it is a desire for unmediated experience spurred on by the
Real, but because communication is always mediated, this desire is
frustrated as soon as it is expressed.]{.underline} The quest for the
Real ends up mired in the Symbolic. Unable to enjoy the Real because its
loss is the necessary condition for subjectivity in the first place, we
invest in subjectivity instead, enjoying the perceived control over
presence and absence demonstrated in the fort-da dynamic. In developing
this argument[, I hope to make a contribution to communication studies
by showing that silence, omission, and lack do not just frustrate our
effort to communicate, but partly determine the ways in which we do
so]{.underline}. These unspeakable failures are not therefore purely
negative---they are an excess beyond language, not a vacuum. Specific
media artefacts, whether war games or literary texts, exist instead of
others because they are animated by desire and the uncanny sense of the
Real. Therefore, **[efforts to understand what we do communicate require
attention to the larger economy of desire and that which we cannot
mediate. For rhetoric, this means a new understanding of the sublime as
an uncanny attribute of signifiers and media itself in relation to the
Real, rather than simply a grand style of speech]{.underline}**. For
media and technology studies, [it means acknowledging how the enjoyment
of our power over presence and absence leads us to form attachments that
sustain some particular technologies instead of others]{.underline},
making an account of desire necessary even for a truly materialist
understanding of mediation. **[This also means rethinking the
relationship between public discourse and political
change]{.underline}** since, as the example of nuclear weapons shows,
horror and fascination are woven together such that **[exposing the
potential for catastrophe does not translate into an effective
response]{.underline}**.

#### vote neg in favor of our discourse that exposes what REALLY happens when the Bomb strikes and to expose the language

**Schiappa 89** (Edward Schiappa, Assistant Professor of Speech , Kansas
State University , Manhattan, Kansas, Communication Monographs: The
rhetoric of nukespeak, 1989, pgs 259-261,) Heublein

[Nukespeak]{.underline} actively [structures]{.underline} the
consciousness of [speakers as well as hearers]{.underline}.
Consequently, **[nukespeak is a potentially dangerous \"terministic
screen]{.underline}**\" for those in positions of policy making and in
the military establishment. Burke contends that [terminologies direct
our attention by selecting some aspects of reality to focus on and
deflecting others. Hence the range of what one is able to \"see\" and
comprehend is limited by the available terminology]{.underline},
**[since all else is filtered out by one\'s terministic
screen]{.underline}** (Burke, 1966, pp. 44-47). According to Burke\'s
analysis, **[the likely consequence of nukespeak is that its users will
tend to understand nuclear weapons, strategy, and war as benign or
beneficial rather than repulsive and horrifying]{.underline}**.
[This]{.underline} hypothesized [result is supported by reports of
former members of the military establishment and by an observer of
military \"culture]{.underline}.\" Herman Kahn\'s 1965 book, On
Escalation: Metaphors and Scenarios, provides an excellent example of
the bureaucratic entelechy fostered by nukespeak. Kahn maintained that
certain metaphors were more appropriate than others to describe the
escalation of nuclear war. Kahn rejected the \"strike\" and \"chicken\"
metaphors as \"misleading\" and recommended reference to the \"rungs of
the escalation ladder\" as a \"useful\" metaphor (1965, p. 37). In
contrast to the image of a violent strike or the irrational and
dangerous game of chicken, Kahn offers his own, domesticated vision of
an escalating nuclear war: Another metaphor as useful as the escalation
ladder would be that of an elevator stopping at various floors. We can
think of a typical escalation situation between the United States and
the Soviet Union in terms of a department store with seven floors, each
offering a number of options of varying intensity but still appropriate
to that floor, from which the decision-makers on one side or the other
may choose, (p. 41) In Thomson\'s analysis of the Vietnam war, he
insists that it is impossible to understand the decision-making process
without reference to the role of language (1973, p. 275). From his own
experience in the military establishment Thomson provides examples of
what have been described here as bureaucratization and domestication.
Thomson states that [use of such terms]{.underline} as \"systematic
pressure,\" \"targets of opportunity\" and \"body count\" [bred a
\"bureaucratic\" or \"game-theory\" detachment]{.underline}. Describing
the intensity of a proposed bombing and strafing strategy, Thomson
quotes an Assistant Secretary of State: \"It seems to me that our
orchestration should be mainly violins, but with periodic touches of
brass\" (1973, p. 274). Thomson concludes, not surprisingly, that such
language led to \"professional callousness\" in the conduct of the
Vietnam war. Nash provides a similar report based on his experience as a
former intelligence analyst for the Air Targets Division of the Air
Force. He recounts a variety of maxims, acronyms, and loaded terms which
\"helped to obscure the reality of what the work was all about---to
distract attention from the homicidal reality and give a brighter hue to
the ominous\" (1980, p. 26). His examples match the twin strategies of
bureaucratization and domestication. Nash states that the use of such
phrases as \"power vacuum\" and \"power equilibrium\" had \"the ring of
respected and predictable laws of the physical sciences that had nothing
to do with such things as war and annihilation\" (1980, p. 26). Nash
also provides anecdotal evidence of the effects of domestication: I
recall the time in the late 1950s when the term \"baby H-bomb\" was
commonly used in referring to low yield, small tactical nuclear weapons
suitable for use in limited wars. This image of the lovable \"baby\"
bomb helped to make a typical question in war planning such as \"should
we deliver 10 or 15 baby nukes on the Irkutsk Party headquarters?\" seem
like an innocent inquiry, (p. 26) **[Conceived in the domesticated and
bureaucratized language of nukespeak, nuclear war becomes far more than
\"thinkable;\" it becomes the banal by-product of the ultimate \"trained
incapacity]{.underline}**.\" [By domesticating the results of a nuclear
attack]{.underline} through such \"humanizing\" metaphors as
\"crippling\" and \"disabling,\" [nuclear war appears recoverable and
limitable, and]{.underline} hence **[contributes to \"the
underestimation of the risks involved]{.underline}** in starting a
nuclear war\" (Hook, 1985, p. 71[). By bureaucratizing nuclear
war]{.underline} through sanitized jargon and metaphors [based
on]{.underline} trade, **[games]{.underline}** and physics, military
[planners avoid the major moral considerations of nuclear
war]{.underline}, since nukespeak \"enables America\'s nuclear war
planners to maintain a moral self-image, treat the extermination of
millions as a \'job\', and obfuscate the value problem underlying the
use of nuclear weapons\" (Hook, 1985, p. 72). An \"anthropological\" or
\"ethnographic\" study by Carol Cohn (1987), senior research fellow of
the Center for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age of the Harvard
University Medical School, provides additional evidence of the
incapacitating effects of nukespeak on users.1 Cohn spent a year as a
participant and observer in a university \"center on defense technology
and arms control.\" [The center was populated by \"defense
intellectuals]{.underline}\"---persons who move between government
positions, influential defense \"think tanks\" and academic
institutions---[who \"create the theory that informs and legitimates
American nuclear strategic practice.]{.underline}\" During Cohn\'s
research she \"attended lectures, listened to arguments, conversed with
defense analysts,\" and generally went \"native\" in an effort to
understand the \"rationality\" of the \"professional discourse\" of
nuclear theorists (pp. 687-688). Cohn reports that language patterns
learned in her study (described here as domestication and
bureaucratization) had the overall effect of reconstructing the
consciousness of nukespeak users. In terms of domestication, Cohn found
that **[the use of abstraction and euphemism redirected attention away
from the realities of a nuclear situation.]{.underline}** [The
words]{.underline} were \"so bland that they **[never forced the speaker
or enabled the listener to touch the realities of nuclear holocaust that
lay behind the words]{.underline}**\" (p. 690). The reliance on harmless
sounding metaphors such as \"Christmas tree farm\" for a line of
submarine missiles ready for launch, \"footprint\" for the pattern in
which missile warheads land, \"BAMBI\" for an early version of an
antiballistic missile system, and \"cookie cutter\" for the neutron bomb
took away the \"emotional fallout that would result ,if it were clear
one was talking about plans for mass murder, mangled bodies, and
unspeakable human suffering\" (p. 691). What has been described here as
mystification by bureaucratization was also documented by Cohn. Early in
her research, Cohn was reluctant to learn and use the \"expert\"
language. This reluctance to communicate in the language of the nuclear
strategists had the effect of disenfranchising Cohn. Her opinions were
inferior: \"No matter how informed or complex my questions were, if I
spoke English rather then expert jargon, the men responded to me as
though I were ignorant, simple minded, or both. It did not appear to
occur to anyone that I might actually be choosing not to speak their
language\" (p. 708). This attitude made it imperative for anyone who
wished to contribute in the exchange to learn the technical language. In
short, **[nukespeak actively structures the consciousness of speakers in
ways that separate the technical possibilities from related moral and
ethical concerns]{.underline}**. Specialized professional vocabularies
are unavoidable. Their use is inevitable and even beneficial for the
conceptual progress of intellectual disciplines. However, the uncritical
use of nukespeak by \"expert\" speakers neglects the fact that nuclear
policy involves issues of public concern. Moreover, there is a risk that
nukespeak will use its speakers as much as they use it. Once the
nukespeaker turns technician, the issue is no longer whether or not an
action should be taken, but simply a question of logistics. [The use of
nukespeak cognitively separates competing \"technical\" and \"social\"
knowledge claims **and renders the attendant moral concerns
obsolete**]{.underline}

[If psychoanalysis emerges out of the suffering that integration into
the social order causes, it also reveals how the subject\'s satisfaction
depends on the public world that appears to thwart this
satisfaction.]{.underline} This idea, as much as any other, forms the
basis for psychoanalytic practice. Unlike philosophers like Descartes or
Kant, [Freud doesn\'t believe that one can arrive at the truth of one\'s
being through private introspection]{.underline}. **[It is only when one
is in public and talking to others that one reveals this truth. This is
why others know us better than we know ourselves]{.underline}**. As
Freud points out in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, \"It can in
fact be said quite generally that **[everyone is continually practising
psychical analysis on his neighbours and consequently learns to know
them better than they know themselves]{.underline}**.\"16 [No amount of
introspection can replace public interaction for the revelation of
truth.]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysis eschews the possibility of self-analysis for precisely
this reason]{.underline}. Even though Freud claims to have performed a
self-analysis and even published the results, he doesn\'t develop this
as a general practice or possibility. In fact, Jacques Lacan often calls
Freud\'s self-analysis the \"original sin\" of psychoanalysis.
[**Self-analysis is impossible because it remains within the domain of
privacy, a domain predominated by narcissistic illusion and imaginary
ideals**. In our private worlds, we count the value of our conscious
intentions far too highly, and we simultaneously fail to grasp our
unconscious motivations. We pay attention to our conscious intentions
rather than to the signifiers that we employ unconsciously. To
psychoanalyze oneself is to fall further into one\'s **private
self-deception**]{.underline}. [Psychoanalysis requires the analyst to
act as the point of connection to the public world. This association of
psychoanalysis with the public world places it at odds with the demands
of capitalism]{.underline}.

[**The psychoanalytic session**---and this distinguishes it, more than
anything else]{.underline}, from other forms of therapy---**[occurs in a
public space]{.underline}**. Even though psychoanalysts don\'t typically
go on television and give public accounts of their analysands private
lives, [**the act of analysis itself is public in the sense that it
publicizes what the analysand would prefer to have remain private**. In
the act of analysis, the analysand confronts a public and articulates
its desire through this confrontation. The analyst stands in for the
desire of the public, and the subject discovers its desire through the
encounter with this desire of the Other]{.underline}.17 [By assisting
the subject in discovering and naming its own desire, psychoanalysis
hopes to lead the subject from desire to driv]{.underline}e. As theorist
Alenka Zupancic sees it, [analysis leads the subject from desire to
drive by leading the subject further down the path of its
desire.]{.underline} She notes, \"[In order to arrive at the drive, one
must pass through desire and insist on it until the very
end]{.underline}.\"18 Subjects come to psychoanalysis without knowing
the truth of their desire, and they leave---hopefully---with a
commitment of fidelity to their desire that places them in the drive,
which involves a different sort of relation to the object.

#### Education outweighs fairness -- we have to evaluate debate norms 

**Lundberg '10** (Christian O, Master of the House of Theory, Professor
of Communications @ University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,
"Tradition of Debate in North Carolina" in Navigating Opportunity:
Policy Debate in the 21st Century By Allan D. Louden, p306-313)

Debate shares this commitment to reinvention with democracy: one of the
great virtues of democracy, noted in Greek antiquity and reiterated by
modern-day theorists from John Dewey to Jacques Derrida, is that
[democracy is amenable to critique, reformulation, and improvement.
Dewey captures this]{.underline} notion [in the idea of "creative
intelligence,"]{.underline} which holds that [the]{.underline} very
contingent [conditions that invite democratic life]{.underline} together
[in the first place]{.underline} also [allow for the]{.underline}
creative and [deliberative reformulation of democracy in response to its
challenges]{.underline} (Dewey and Moore 2007). Derrida (2001) has
argued similarly that [democracy]{.underline}'s best feature is that it
[is both revisable and perfectible]{.underline}. The implication of
democracy's revisability and perfectibility extends both backward into
an account of democracy's founding conditions and forward to its ideal
future: to a "democracy yet to come" (Derrida 2001). Perfectibility and
revisability imply that the democracy we have now is neither perfect,
complete, nor guaranteed in advance. At the same time, [perfectibility
and revisability imply that whatever democracy's failings, the founding
condition of democracy]{.underline} also [invites the possibility that
democracy will exceed its current iterations and be made anew, into
something that is better]{.underline}. As democratic technology and
technique, [debate builds a]{.underline} structural [commitment
to]{.underline} perfectibility and [revisability]{.underline} into
democratic discourse, [by suggesting that current conditions of
democratic life be open to critical analysis]{.underline} and that our
common democratic life might be lived differently. Because debate
practice highlights both the revisability and perfectibility of
democratic life, on balance, the best answer to the drawbacks of
debate's current cultural articulations is, to put it bluntly, more
debate. Specifically, by the very practice of holding critical questions
up for public contest, [debate pedagogy inculcates an ethos that sees
democracy as not already here, but]{.underline} as something in the
making, so much so that a commitment to debate embodies both the
strongest critique of and best hope for perfecting democratic
politics---debate practices, by their nature, relentlessly rearticulate
democracy. More pointedly for Greene and Hicks's critique, the best way
out of a broader sense of democratic insularity lies in turning debate
toward the presuppositions of American exceptionalism, a move present in
the most simple act of debate: that is, [in pointing out that there is
something flawed in]{.underline} the status quo or in [our
**conventional approaches**]{.underline} to fixing it.
[Debate]{.underline} practice contains within itself the conditions for
exceeding the current articulation of democracy and simultaneously
[cultivates capacities that provide concrete political hope]{.underline}
that we might realize a democracy that is different from the one we have
now. The alternative, to give up on debate, leaves not only the
insularity of debate's articulation to democracy intact, but more
important, leaves the whole edifice of American exceptionalism, which is
rooted deeply at many sites beyond debate, fundamentally untroubled. The
final critique of debate pedagogy that I address is that debate practice
promotes a naive conception of the speaking citizen that is
inappropriate to our current democratic context. This critique of
debate, while useful in highlighting the changing conditions of
governance that implicate all of us, fails on two accounts. First, even
though the citizen speaking in public may not hold the same sway it once
did (if it ever did), speech does make a difference in a number of
democratic processes: political speech influences how people vote and to
whom they contribute money, and it makes a significant difference at a
number of sites in the administrative apparatuses of modern government
(for instance in public notice and comment practices). More important,
even if the romantic vision of the individual citizen's speech changing
the course of democratic life is a bit overblown in our context,
political speech makes an important difference in noninstitutional
practices of political socialization: political speech not only
influences who we will vote for but also sets the bar for what we will
put up with, profoundly influences our views regarding the legitimacy of
public policies, and determines the range of opinions to which we are
exposed. Thus, even if debate practices do not directly access the
levers of power, they might play a significant role in the production
and reformulation of our political culture. The second major problem
with the critique that identifies a naivety in articulating debate and
democracy is that it presumes that the primary pedagogical outcome of
debate is speech capacities. But the democratic capacities built by
debate are not limited to speech---as indicated earlier, debate builds
capacity for critical thinking, analysis of public claims, informed
decision making, and better public judgment. If the picture of modern
political life that underwrites this critique of debate is a pessimistic
view of increasingly labyrinthine and bureaucratic administrative
politics, rapid scientific and technological change outpacing the
capacities of the citizenry to comprehend them, and ever-expanding
insular special-interest- and money-driven politics, it is a puzzling
solution, at best, to argue that these conditions warrant giving up on
debate. If democracy is open to rearticulation, it is open to
rearticulation precisely because as the challenges of modern political
life proliferate, the citizenry's capacities can change, which is one of
the primary reasons that theorists of democracy such as Dewey in The
Public and Its Problems place such a high premium on education (Dewey
1988, 63, 154). Debate provides an indispensible form of education in
the modern articulation of democracy because it builds precisely the
skills that allow the citizenry to research and be informed about policy
decisions that impact them, to sort through and evaluate the evidence
for and relative merits of arguments for and against a policy in an
increasingly information-rich environment, and to prioritize their time
and political energies toward policies that matter the most to them.
[The merits of debate as a tool for building democratic
capacity-building take on a special significance in the context of
information literacy.]{.underline} John Larkin (2005, 140) argues that
one of the primary failings of modern colleges and universities is that
they have not changed curriculum to match with the challenges of a new
information environment. This is a problem for the course of academic
study in our current context, but perhaps more important, argues Larkin,
for the future of a citizenry that will need to make evaluative choices
against an increasingly complex and multimediated information
environment (ibid.). Larkin's study tested the benefits of debate
participation on information-literacy skills and concluded that in-class
debate participants reported significantly higher self-efficacy ratings
of their ability to navigate academic search databases and to
effectively search and use other Web resources: To analyze the
self-report ratings of the instructional and control group students, we
first conducted a multivariate analysis of variance on all of the
ratings, looking jointly at the effect of instruction/no instruction and
debate topic . . . that it did not matter which topic students had been
assigned . . . students in the Instructional \[debate\] group were
significantly more confident in their ability to access information and
less likely to feel that they needed help to do so. . . . These findings
clearly indicate greater self-efficacy for online searching among
students who participated in \[debate\]. . . . These results constitute
strong support for the effectiveness of the project on students'
self-efficacy for online searching in the academic databases. There was
an unintended effect, however: After doing . . . the project,
instructional group students also felt more confident than the other
students in their ability to get good information from Yahoo and Google.
It may be that the library research experience increased self-efficacy
for any searching, not just in academic databases. (Larkin 2005, 144)
Larkin's study substantiates Thomas Worthen and Gaylen Pack's (1992, 3)
claim that debate in the college classroom plays a critical role in
fostering the kind of problem-solving skills demanded by the
increasingly rich media and information environment of modernity. Though
their essay was written in 1992 on the cusp of the eventual explosion of
the Internet as a medium, Worthen and Pack's framing of the issue was
prescient: [the primary question facing]{.underline} today's [student
has changed from how to best research a topic to the crucial question of
learning how to best evaluate **which arguments to cite** and rely upon
from an easily accessible and veritable cornucopia of
materials]{.underline}

[The revolving door between]{.underline} [public officials and defense
contractors has long distorted U.S. foreign policy to serve war
profiteers at the expense of the public interest and basic humanitarian
norms]{.underline}. [From U.S. weaponry ending up in the hands of ISIS,
to supplying arms fueling civil conflict and therefore contributing to
the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, the lack of
oversight on arms deals has enabled human rights
atrocities]{.underline}. The global arms trade is experiencing its
greatest boom since the Cold War, fueled by horrific wars in the Middle
East and revitalized power rivalries among China, Russia and the United
States. In their most recent report, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute revealed a 44 percent increase in arms sales from
2002 to 2017. T[he United States is the world's biggest arms exporter by
far, holding 34 percent of total market share --- a 58 percent lead on
Russia, its closest competitor. From 2017 to 2018, U.S. arms sales to
foreign governments increased 33 percent, in part due to the Trump
administration's diminished legal restraints on supplying foreign
militias.]{.underline} "\[T\]he people that are making these deals for
the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these
companies," President Trump said during an interview with "Fox News
Sunday" in December 2016. "You, know, they make a deal like that and
then a year later, or two years later, or three years later you see them
working for these big companies that made the deal." Before entering the
White House, Trump asserted his belief in a "lifetime restriction" on
top defense officials working for private defense contractors after
their public service. Two years later, the Project on Government
Oversight released a detailed analysis of the defense sector, revealing
645 instances of federal employees working for the 20 largest Pentagon
contractors in fiscal year 2016, the latest year with complete data. [Of
the 645 instances of former public servants transitioning to work for
private defense corporations, 90 percent were hired to work as
lobbyists, where they seek to influence public policy to benefit their
private employers]{.underline}. After the resignation of Gen. James
Mattis, Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan filled the post as
interim head of the Defense Department. Before joining the Trump
administration, Shanahan spent three decades working for Boeing --- a
blatant conflict of interest for the person responsible for overseeing
federal contracts with private defense contractors. Col. Lawrence
Wilkerson, Colin Powell's former chief of staff, called Shanahan "a
living, breathing product of the military-industrial complex," and
asserted that "this revolving door keeps the national security elite
very small, and very wealthy, and increasing its wealth as it goes up
the chain." One egregious example of that revolving door is Heather
Wilson, who has been secretary of the Air Force since 2017. In 2015,
Lockheed Martin paid a \$4.7 million settlement to the Department of
Justice after the revelation it had used taxpayer funds to hire
lobbyists for a \$2.4 billion contract. One of the lobbyists was former
New Mexico Representative Wilson, ranked as one of the "most corrupt
members of Congress" by the nonprofit government watchdog group Citizens
for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Wilson was later confirmed
as Air Force secretary in the Senate by a 76-22 vote. Mark T. Esper, the
secretary of the Army, worked as vice president of government relations
for Raytheon before joining the Trump administration in 2017. The Hill
recognized Esper as one of Washington's most powerful corporate
lobbyists in 2015 and 2016, where he fought to influence acquisition
policy and other areas of defense bills. Esper's undersecretary, Ryan
McCarthy, is a former Lockheed executive. The Trump administration's
commitment to advancing arms sales is not only apparent in the legion of
officials with severe conflicts of interests occupying the cabinet, but
also through directives in official arms export policy. The State
Department's updated Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy
Implementation Plan was released in November 2018 and detailed loosened
restrictions on the sale of drones and other weapons, new financing
options for countries who can't afford U.S. weaponry, and aims to put
pressure on diplomats to put arms deals at the forefront of their
mission. Rachel Stohl, an arms trade expert with the Stimson Center,
described the updated policy, saying, "If you read between the lines, it
could be a green light for the U.S. to sell more with less restraint." A
glaring example of the arms industry's influence on State Department
policy is demonstrated by a September 20, 2018, report from The Wall
Street Journal[. According to the report, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
was convinced to continue support for the Saudi campaign in Yemen for
the sake of a \$2 billion arms deal with U.S.-based defense contractor
Raytheon. The State Department's legislative affairs staff, who
influenced Pompeo's decision, is led by Assistant Secretary of State
Charles Faulkner, a former Raytheon lobbyist.]{.underline} Recent
developments by the Trump administration have clarified the nature of
the relationship between defense contractors and the federal government,
but it would be erroneous to place the majority of the blame on him for
the greater trend in global arms sales. Under President Barack Obama,
arms exports doubled compared to President George W. Bush, reaching more
than \$200 billion in total approved deals (approved deals don't
represent actualized contracts, as deals can take years to be ordered
and completed). The rapid increase in exports was part of a broader
strategy to replace U.S. soldiers with surrogates in allied countries,
as well as to placate allies in Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) --- countries incensed by the administration's nuclear
deal with Iran. Despite brokering more arms deals than any
administration since World War II, President Obama did enforce holds on
arms exports to some countries deemed guilty of human rights abuses,
including Bahrain, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. All of these holds were
lifted shortly after the Trump administration took power. The Trump
administration's priorities on arms sales were further demonstrated
after the CIA confirmed Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in
ordering the savage execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. President
Trump resisted calls to punish the Saudi prince on the grounds that
punitive action would jeopardize lucrative arms deals with the kingdom.
President Trump's claims vastly overstated the amount of jobs and money
to be lost if the U.S. withdrew support for Saudi military adventurism.
[Research from Brown University shows domestic investment in education
and health care creates more than twice as many jobs as military
spending. Trump's argument that we have to provide Saudi Arabia or the
UAE with bombs that land on school buses, hospitals and weddings in
order to preserve jobs is unconscionable and demonstrates a warped sense
of priorities. We don't have to contribute to what a United Nations
Children's Fund official has labeled a "war on children" to maintain
what accumulates to a total of less than 0.5 percent of U.S. jobs. We
can invest in productive sectors of the economy like renewable energy
and create jobs that truly serve our society**. A real debate on the
arms trade is nearly absent from public conversation because the
industry can only thrive in secrecy and duplicity**]{.underline}.
Consider former House Speaker Paul Ryan's final move as a public
official, in which he snuck a provision to curtail debate on Saudi
support in Yemen into the U.S. farm bill in December. Fortunately,
Ryan's manipulative tactics would fail to prevent the House from finally
passing a resolution to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen on
February 13. Trump has indicated the Yemen resolution will be his first
veto, as it represents a major check to executive power and a direct
rebuke to his arms export-based style of diplomacy. After Trump pulled
out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the
Iran nuclear deal, defense companies enjoyed an immediate boost to their
stock. [This is because demand in the arms trade surges alongside
geopolitical instability. Heightened volatility encourages higher arms
sales, and the dissemination of weapons to despotic regimes increases
volatility, creating a vicious cycle further entrenched by a revolving
door of defense contractors who influence public policy to benefit
private weapons manufacturers. I]{.underline}n his famous farewell
speech, President Dwight Eisenhower warned the U.S. public of this exact
predicament, what he called the "military-industrial complex."
[**President Eisenhower's warning remains prescient nearly 60 years
later, as the failure to regulate the defense sector has led the U.S. to
arm its enemies, enable humanitarian crises and desecrate its values.**
While the historic House resolution to end U.S. support for the war in
Yemen is proof we can take concrete action to confront the military
industrial complex, **greater public awareness is needed to transform
U.S. foreign policy in a profound manner**]{.underline}. Just as
President Eisenhower suggested**[, it is time for an alert and
knowledgeable citizenry to challenge the reasoning behind the U.S.'s
endless wars and fight for a more peaceful future.]{.underline}**

[A number of war games]{.underline}, both military and civilian, [have
attempted to create the experience of nuclear war and give participants
some control over the results of the model]{.underline}. This is
ultimately what differentiates simulation from representation:
[Games]{.underline} such as First Strike [do]{.underline} [not attempt
to show players one vision of a nuclear war]{.underline} as a novel,
television show, or film would do. As simulations, they create the
conditions for players to participate in a model of war, ''playing''
between structure (the rules and procedures of the game) and contingency
(the decisions and actions of the player), rather than consume a
representation of the conflict's course. [The enjoyment]{.underline} of
First Strike [comes from this **perceived** aspect of control in
simulation. Although its procedures suggest that nuclear war is winnable
and exciting and its paratextual diegetic suggests that such a war ought
to be abhorred]{.underline}, the [enjoyment]{.underline} of First Strike
[is perhaps best explained as an effect of the relationship
between]{.underline} **[mediation and the desire for experiences beyond
it]{.underline}**, in excess of persuasion or the fun of play. **[Many
works on nuclear war describe it as a possibility that frustrates the
representational capabilities of language]{.underline}**. Long before
Derrida announced its fabulous textuality, Brigadier General Thomas
Farrell reported this account of the Trinity test: Thirty seconds after
the explosion came first, the air blast pressing hard against the people
and things, to be followed almost immediately by the strong, sustained,
awesome roar which warned of doomsday and made us feel that we puny
things were blasphemous to dare tamper with the forces heretofore
reserved to The Almighty. [Words are inadequate tools for the job of
acquainting those not present with the physical, mental and
psychological effects]{.underline}. It had to be witnessed to be
realized. (As cited in Groves, 1962, pp. 437--438) The theme of nuclear
war as ''unthinkable'' or ''unspeakable'' has continued ever since. [The
kind of full-scale global nuclear war modeled]{.underline} by First
Strike [is often treated in almost mystical terms as an experience
simply beyond human ken]{.underline} (Chernus, 1986). This is a
magnification of Freud's (2011c/1915) argument, made in ''Thoughts For
The Times On War and Death,'' that we cannot imagine our own demise.
Nuclear war presents the possibility of total human extinction in which
even the compensatory promise of immortality in the continuity of future
generations or the species overall is eliminated (Lifton, 1996). That
said, **[we have always tried to grasp the enormity of a nuclear war and
communicate it anyway]{.underline}**. Herman Kahn, a prominent nuclear
strategist, argued for ''thinking about the unthinkable,'' in both the
book by that name and in his more famous work On Thermonuclear War
because possible ''postwar states'' could be more or less desirable
(Kahn, 2007/1960, pp. 19-- 21). First Strike avoids a confrontation with
the discontinuity of nuclear extinction by simply making it impossible
within the rules of the game. The Real is encountered where speaking
subjects are pushed up against the limits of language. The importance of
the Real is not so much that a nonhuman world of mind-independent
objects exists, but rather the effect that our sudden confrontation with
the failure of language to mediate has on the subject[. Language
mediates the world and makes possible a subject in relation to
others]{.underline}. When we are aware that the world exceeds our grasp,
we confront a ''failed unicity'' that dislocates our sense of united
subject in a comprehensible world. In response, we feign unicity by
retroactively creating meaning for these tears in mediated social
reality, by repetitively attempting to symbolize what exceeds
symbolization (Lundberg, 2012, p. 2). [This process should be a concern
for rhetoric because the symbolic economy in which we invest ourselves
is an operation of metonymy and metaphor, a movement of tropes that form
a mediated world]{.underline}. Thus, as Lundberg (2012, p. 38) argues,
rhetoric and psychoanalysis require one another. [Contemplating the
possibility of human extinction]{.underline}---or at least the end of
civilization---[makes plain our precarious balance at the edge of an
abyss and brings to mind fundamental questions about the meaning and
direction of human existence]{.underline}. Our appointment with the Real
is perpetually missed because it cannot be rendered in language. Efforts
to do so anyway are a means of shoring up reality (the socially
constructed world in which we live, as opposed to the Real) and also
individual subjects, trying to fix the plot holes in the story of
coherence that we tell ourselves. Because the Real cannot, by
definition, be communicated, stories fall short and are repeated again
and again, chasing an adequation with reality that can never be
achieved. **[The details of these stories are less important than the
sense that the speaking subject is exercising genuine
agency]{.underline}**. In this regard, First Strike bears a strong
similarity to Freud's fort-da game. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle,
Freud (2011a/1920) recounts a game played by a young boy of his
acquaintance. The boy had a wooden reel attached to a string which he
would throw over his curtained cot, making it ''gone'' (fort). Then he
would pull the spool back into view, rejoicing that it was ''there''
(da). He would repeat these actions again and again. The game can be
read as the child inuring himself against the potential absence of his
mother, but a more productive reading would locate enjoyment not in the
conditions of ''gone'' or ''here'' but in [the exercise of control over
the conditions of presence and absence]{.underline}, essentially a
simulation that [permits agency over a situation]{.underline} in which
the child must be passive (Freud, 2011a/1920, pp. 3721--3722). Games are
a particularly powerful media for this control if they differ from
representation based on the player's ability to affect the outcome of
each repetition within the procedures created by the game. [This sense
of control]{.underline}, that the outcome is dependent on the player's
actions, [is a key feature that distinguishes]{.underline} video
[games]{.underline} (and, in principle, other simulations) [from
traditional linear texts in which the reader's choice is more limited,
as is exposure to ''risk'']{.underline} (Aarseth, 1997, p. 4). In First
Strike, players are compelled to repeat by the incentive structure of
the game, which rewards repeated plays with new countries to fight as or
against. But even without this procedural reward, the game encourages
repetition. It is almost impossible to play a ''perfect'' game, and the
outcome could always be changed somewhat, and as no two sessions are
identical, repetition is always repetition with a difference. In the
words of one reviewer, ''The replay value is through the roof, since
every experience is different. Even without multiplayer, you will come
back over and over again'' (Gil, 2014, n.p.). In the words of another,
the game is a ''replayable single-player strategy game that I kept
coming back to long after I had enough material for my review''
(Faraday, 2014b, n.p.). First Strike's repetition allows players to
enjoy useless subjectivity (Lacan, 1998, p. 3) or the enjoyment of the
subject as subject---the enjoyment of the capacity for choice primarily
rather than the results of specific choices. In his article ''Tether and
Accretions: Fantasy as Form in Videogames,'' Christopher Goetz (2012)
describes one mode of producing pleasure in video games as the
''tether'' fantasy. [**Players enjoy exposing themselves to risk,
''expanding'' out into the world, and then withdrawing into a safer
space, repeating the process again and again**. Being caught in a
vulnerable state can be a ''playful act'' even when this play is
''repetitious of an originally horrifying event'']{.underline} (p. 423).
The ''worrying'' fun of First Strike is understandable as the uncanny
effect of repetition and simulation fever. Recall that for Bogost,
simulation fever is the gap between the performance of a simulated
system and the player's concept of that system's operation ''in real
life.'' This fits well with Freud's understanding of the uncanny, where
''an uncanny effect is often and easily produced when the distinction
between imagination and reality is effaced, as when \... a symbol takes
over the full functions of the thing it symbolizes'' (2011b/1919, p.
3964). [Players]{.underline} of First Strike [are]{.underline} [made
uncomfortable by the juxtaposition of fun and war, but the illusion of
control, the ability to exit the game and continue their lives, creates
a tether like that attached to the young boy's reel, permitting them to
control the conditions by which the simulated world is made present and
absent]{.underline}. Perhaps the enjoyment of this control explains why
so many reviewers requested a pause feature, originally absent but added
in an update by Blindflug (TouchArcade, 2014). [That
discomfort]{.underline} persists [can be understood]{.underline} [as the
game's incomplete move **to conceal the more horrifying associations of
nuclear war**]{.underline}. First Strike might strengthen certain
metaphorical connections, for example, those between nuclear war and
victory, at the expense of other metonymic ones, such as the direct
bodily horror of radiation burns and screaming victims. **[These elided
connections that proliferate meaning may be concealed, but they persist

This legacy should be revisited. [The economy of nuclear discourse since
the day Of Trinity has been driven by the attempt to get closer to the
Real]{.underline}, to have the Bomb as it \"really is.\" Later, I will
suggest that nuclear simulations were pre- sented as more real and more
rational than the doomsday imaginations of LeMay and the early Strategic
Air Command. Schell\'s Fate Of the Earth was another effort to bring
Americans face-to-face with the reality of nuclear war, as were the more
explicitly fictional novels churned out over the last seventy years.
**[Under- lying these efforts is the fact that nuclear war remains
\"fabulously textual\"]{.underline}** in Der- rida\'s terms.29--- [There
have been atrocities related to nuclear weapons and their
production]{.underline} **[indigenous peoples]{.underline}** and
downwinders **[subjected to nuclear test- ing, inner city populations
confined and targeted]{.underline}** in the name of the Bomb, **[US
soldiers made to witness tests with inadequate protection, and nonhuman
ani- mals subjected to cruelty in the name Of understanding just what a
nuclear war might be like]{.underline}**. **[But there has never been a
nuclear war in the sense that strate- gists,]{.underline}** novelists,
and survivalists **[imagined]{.underline}**. [Superpower nuclear war
exists only in writing, images, and film]{.underline}. To [imagine the
graphic details of a possible nuclear war does not reveal the truth but
instead relies on the same dynamic that makes the Bomb so fascinating in
the first place: **a sense that the right symbols can ac- cess the
Real**]{.underline}. The supposedly sanitized official language of
nuclear war does not always circumvent feeling or shut down thought.
These [terms]{.underline} can also [elicit]{.underline} grim
[fascination by those not subject to their direct material
effects.]{.underline} More than just a set Of shibboleth words, the
arcane terminology Of nuclear \"\"arfare con- veys power, threat, and
control through litotes and catachresis. As Cohn has ob- served, these
utterances can capture even those who set out to oppose nuclear
violence.30 [Engaged scholarship requires that rhetorical criticism Of
the nuclear weapons complex includes]{.underline} a hard, perhaps
uncomfortable 100k not Only at the language Of the Bomb, but [the
underlying ecology Of desire that sustains it]{.underline}. That is the
ultimate purpose of this book "the 2016 election further supports the
claim that knowledge does not au- tomatically translate into resistance.
Clinton\'s ads, Blair\'s letter, Obama\'s pub- lic statements, and many
high-profile denunciations by national security experts demonstrated
that Trump lacked even a cursory understanding of nuclear issues. Still,
he was elected, as other populist right-wing leaders have been. Trump\'s
vir- cue was not his knowledge, but quite the opposite: he openly
rejected expert opinion and advice, and this only bolstered his
antiestablishment credentials. [There is no reason to assume that
exposing the quotidian violence of uranium mining on indigenous lands,
the plight of dying downwinders, Or the probabili- ties of nuclear war
will change anything]{.underline}. Information about all of these topics
is readily available alongside lurid postapocalyptic fantasies. As Lacan
says in his seminar on Edgar Allan Poe\'s \"The Purloined the message is
in plain sight, but its contents are far less important than the
relative positioning of the subjects around it. Today, information about
all manners Of oppression is avail- able at the stroke Of a key.
Students read John Hersey\'s Hiroshima in school. Hundreds Of
documentaries examine nuclear issues in depth. The Doomsday Clock is
trotted out on occasion. Excellent academic work exists about the on-
going consequences of Cold War defense structures for diverse groups
around the world**[. It is not concealment that sustains the Bomb, but a
web Of imaginary investments and desires]{.underline}**. For this
reason, **[I propose to examine the web of investments that sustain the
Bomb within a particular discourse]{.underline}**. My goal is not to
document the violence suffered by those who are exposed to the material
effects Of nuclear infrastruc- ture. While every entity on Earth is a
potential sacrifice in the event Of nuclear war, [many suffer every day
from the ongoing preparations for global nuclear vio-
lence.]{.underline} **[Their stories]{.underline}**---and the
similarities and differences contained within---**[are of vital
importance because they illustrate the stakes Of antinuclear
scholarship]{.underline}**. [But to resist the depredations Of the
nuclear security state requires understanding what sustains it **for
those who inflict violence upon others**.]{.underline} [I am
writing]{.underline} about, and [primarily for]{.underline}, **[those
who are largely Insulated from the effects of this
violence]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, while not plotting impact
points on maps or holding launch keys in their hands, [are
implicated]{.underline} to varying degrees [in the]{.underline} vast
[complex Of nuclearism]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the taxes they
pay, the media they consume, or [the simple privilege of being able to
ignore this violence in their daily lives]{.underline}. Like many
academics, I am one of them. [Even a critical perspective toward the
Bomb often relies on security]{.underline}. Mary Manjikian writes that
\"imagining destruction may serve to launch the crea- tive impulse
involved in reimagining structures and society. Howcwer, when one is
truly the subject of that destruction, the impulse is only to flee the
building and to survive.\"32 [1 have used \"we\" and \"us\" to mark this
more privileged group and my complicity in it, rather than the more
comfortable \"they\" and \"them]{.underline}.\" I am inspired in this
focus by Lifton\'s studies on the perpetrators of genocide and the
disavowals that allowed bureaucrats, soldiers, and civilians to
understand themselves as good, ordinary people while committing the most
extreme acts Of violence,33 alongside Cohn\'s beautiful cautionary work
on the seductive power that nuclear language holds for both those in the
national security infrastruc- ture and their critics. As Masahide Kato
has noted, \"[undeclared nuclear war- fare]{.underline}\" [is occluded
by the fantasy of a global nuclear exchange which by its scale **and
splendor disqualifies Other forms Of nuclear violence from
consideration**]{.underline}.34

wager,"9/14/17, pgs 11-13) Heublein

The difficulty with Schell's argument (and conversely, with Cheney's) is
equivalent to the "many gods" objection to Pascal's wager. [Given a
range of]{.underline} mutually exclusive options, each representing [a
potentially infinite impact]{.underline}, **[there is no longer a way to
choose amongst them]{.underline}**. For Pascal, that decision boiled
down to faith, but the same was [true for the Bush
administration]{.underline} [in its embrace of impulse and conviction
over rationality and evidence]{.underline} (Suskind 2006, 308). [This
same problem affects decisions over other existential threats: perhaps
manipulating asteroids to miss the Earth would save us all, but perhaps
the technology could be used to cause a strike; perhaps slowing the rate
of climate change could prevent warming temperatures and ecological
disruption, but perhaps it could cause a new ice age; perhaps space
colonization would safeguard the human species, but perhaps it would
attract the attention of xenocidal extraterrestrials]{.underline}.
**[Infinite stakes combined with indeterminate probabilities and the
necessity of decision is a counsel of despair.]{.underline}** Even if,
like [Pascal's]{.underline}, Schell's [wager is not meant to be a
logical proof **but an appeal to a dislocating sublime force**, the
problem remains]{.underline}. The rhetorical effect of the infinity
trope is part of nuclear deterrence. [One accepted mission of the US
nuclear arsenal remains as the capacity to "overawe" enemies with the
sheer incalculable force of thermonuclear weapons]{.underline} (Oelrich
2005, 46[). The "madman" theory of nuclear deterrence]{.underline},
named for Richard Nixon, [**relies on projecting the image of
irrationality over nuclear decisions to that a rational opponent might
believe that they will actually be used in response to aggression,**
even if the cost to the defender is also very high]{.underline}.11
**[This is precisely the logic of doomsday weapons]{.underline}** such
as cobalt bombs or the Dead Hand: the cost of extinction is so high that
it overwhelms any possible gain for an aggressor. Schell's vivid
descriptions of the nuclear aftermath may just as well result in a
passionate commitment to nuclear deterrence. The same factors that make
Schell's appeal powerful also limit the ability to resist Cheney's
reinterpretation of the wager. When rational calculation is made
subservient to infinite risks, **[then reasoned arguments fail to
diminish the force of sublime rhetoric,]{.underline}** [just as the
various logical objections to Pascal's wager have not eliminated its
staying powe]{.underline}r [The limitless damage of a nuclear
war]{.underline} (or imagined terrorist attack) **[overwhelm
reason]{.underline}**. John Mueller (2010) has done a detailed analysis
of the probability of nuclear terrorism that assigns it roughly one in
three billion odds (204--206), but the numinous fear of nuclear weapons
seems to remain. It is tempting to conclude with Ned O'Gorman claim that
[the sublime is antithetical to politics]{.underline}. Because the
sublime is an overwhelming, illimitable force, no adjective changes it;
[there is no "political sublime" because one term cannot modify the
other.]{.underline} As O'Gorman (2006) writes, "[the sublime is a
free-floating force, a univocal power, which because of its univocality
cannot provide alternatives for change, guide critique, or articulate
new horizons]{.underline}. **[The sublime speaks only unpredicated
power]{.underline}**" (889). The sublime may be radical in a sense, but
it is not politically radical. Rather, it tends toward the conservative
because it cannot offer alternatives to the status quo and constitutes a
"rhetorical lure" best employed by the elite and powerful (O'Gorman
2006, 891). In this reading, the present article is merely a Synodus
Horrenda, dragging Pascal forth again as rhetorician rather than a
mathematician and condemning him nonetheless. To write off Pascal's
wager so quickly would be premature. As Schell and Cheney demonstrate,
it is the need for decision that frustrates its possibility and results
in aporia. Both men have read the wager grammatically and used it to
calculate a decision. [They may also present it
rhetorically]{.underline}, [attempting to impress not the rightness of
their judgment]{.underline} **[but the overwhelming force represented by
the infinite losses of a nuclear war]{.underline}**. In either case,
[the wager is still aimed at persuasion but cannot overcome its own
paradoxical logos]{.underline}. What is missing is a different aporia on
an altogether different level: that identified by de Man as the
contradiction of grammar and rhetoric. **[At issue is a practice for
reading the wager]{.underline}**, and this contradiction can be seen
working in Pascal's original if it is read not as an appeal to believe
in a specific God but rather an attempt to disrupt the obstacles that
lead some people not to believe in any power beyond themselves. Pascal
himself was not converted by this proof nor any other, but by the
revelation of his "night of fire." [His wager is not a rational argument
or a rhetorical device, but rather a rhetorical device illustrating the
limits both of rationality and rhetoric]{.underline}. The point of the
coin flip is to demonstrate that no rational decision is possible. Faith
and fidelity constitute a moral life. Pascal argues that piety comes
through repeated practice, but this practice itself is a means to
realize the scope of what exceeds the human, not an end in itself. This
conception of the sublime is not political according to O'Gorman's
definition, where the "sine qua non of all politics except the
totalitarian is differentiation" (2006, 891). As the juxtaposition of
Schell's and Cheney's uses of the wager shows, the political result of
sublime rhetoric is by no means determined by its use. To say that these
figures do not assist one in making instrumental choices between
different political goals is not to suggest that the sublime may still
have radical -- and not necessarily conservative -- potential if
"political" is not synonymous with "politics." As Jean-Luc Nancy (2008)
argues, nothing requires that the two terms be identical and we should
be conscious of our linguistic choice between them (27--28). The
political can be understood as an orientation to community, an attitude
rather than being "dissolved in the sociotechnical element of forces and
needs" (Nancy 1991, 40). [The sublime]{.underline} may not aid directly
in politics, but it [may help to develop a conception]{.underline} of
the political by revealing the limits of our capacity to order and to
comprehend our social world. To dislocate the reader by [illustrating
the limit of knowledge]{.underline} is [**to call into question the
inevitability** of social structures that we have built and
inherited]{.underline}. Nothing about the sublime need favor the elite
and powerful. Oft forgotten in Longinus's writing is an attack on
avarice and material accumulation as measures of value. Longinus argues
that "wealth, honors, reputation, absolute power, and all things which
are accompanied by much external and theatrical pomp" cannot be noble
because to "despise them is in itself no mean blessing" (9). There is a
contradiction inherent in any set of social values that idolizes the
rich because they are rich and also values those who forgo material
benefits because they are hollow and superficial. Why is it, Longinus
asks, that although there is "no dearth" of people "who are persuasive,
interested in public affairs, shrewd, skillful, and certainly delightful
speakers," there are so few who are truly outstanding? His answer is
that the love of money "is a disease that shrinks a man \[sic\]." "I
cannot see how we can honor wealth without limit or, and this is nearer
the truth, make it our god, without admitting into our souls those
kindred evils that inevitably follow it" (Longinus 1991, 57). Rather
than proscribe an instrumental solution like those shrewd speakers
occupied with public affairs might, Longinus seeks to identify the
attachments that serve as the conditions of possibility for corruption.
"For surely if our selfish desires were altogether freed from prison, as
it were, and let loose upon our neighbors, they would scorch the earth
with their evils" (Longinus 1991, 58). The "worst bane" is that nothing
is done for its own sake, he argues, but only because it serves as a
means to an end (58) -- which is close to Nancy's concern about
dissolving the political into the "sociotechnical element" of politics.
[The sublime's inattention to differentiation might be read]{.underline}
[as **a critique of instrumental politics and
accumulation**]{.underline}. Configured this way, Pascal's wager, like
Longinus's sublime and Pseudo-Dionysius's negative theology, displays
the presence of something beyond the technical capacities of reason to
resolve and reveals the arbitrariness of power as it is exercised in an
unequal society. In disorienting its readers, **[the sublime is a check
on hubris rather than the basis for programmatic action]{.underline}**.
At the very least, [the sublime is important for argument research
because its use continues]{.underline}, for better or for worse, and
[exploring the collective psychology **underpinning its
appeal**]{.underline} might be a more effective means of countering its
dangerous uses than rational debunking alone allows. O'Gorman's critique
is a useful corrective for those who might use the concept as a kind of
universal solvent that obviates the need for day-to-day political
choices or provisional commitments. But [the]{.underline} genius of
Pascal's [wager]{.underline} [as a rhetorical trope is its capacity to
remind us that the quotidian decisions of politics]{.underline}, vital
as they are, **[do not exhaust the political itself.]{.underline}**
[What we value in community **has no satisfying objective
basis**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [is something **we must
deliberate collectively** in an age when technological progress makes a
literal Night of Fire all too possible]{.underline}

What distinguishes these critical texts are the startling ways they
struggle to encounter the Uncle Tom form without reproducing it,
declining to pay the inheritance tax. The postsentimental does not
involve an aesthetic disruption to the contract sentimentality makes
between its texts and readers -that proper reading will lead to better
feeling and therefore to a better self. What changes is the place of
repetition in this contract, a crisis frequently thematized in formal
aesthetic and generational terms. [In its traditional and political
modalities, the sentimental promises that in a just world a consensus
will already exist about what constitutes uplift, amelioration, and
emancipation, those horizons toward which empathy powerfully directs
itself.]{.underline} [Identification with suffering, the ethical
response to the sentimental plot, leads to its repetition in the
audience and thus to a generally held view about what transformations
would bring the good life into being. This presumption]{.underline},
that the terms of consent are trans- historical once true feeling is
shared, [explains]{.underline} in part [why emotions, especially painful
ones, are so central to the world-building aspects of sentimental
alliance.]{.underline} Postsentimental texts withdraw from the contract
that presumes consent to the conventionally desired outcomes of
identification and empathy. [The desire for unconflictedness might very
well motivate the sacrifice of surprising ideas to the norms of the
world against which this rhetoric is being deployed.]{.underline} What,
if anything, then, can be built from the very different
knowledge/experience of subaltern pain? What can memory do to create
conditions for freedom and justice without reconfirming the terms of
ordinary subordination? More than a critique of feeling as such, [the
postsentimental modality]{.underline} also [challenges what]{.underline}
literature and [storytelling have come to stand for in the creation of
sentimental national subjects]{.underline} across an almost two-century
span. Three moments in this genealogy, which differ as much from each
other as from the credulous citation of Uncle Tom\'s Cabin we saw in The
King and I and Dimples, will mark here some potential within the arsenal
that counters the repetition compulsions of sentimentality. This essay
began with a famous passage from James Baldwin\'s \"Everybody\'s Protest
Novel,\" a much-cited essay about Uncle Tom\'s Cabin that is rarely read
in the strong sense because its powerful language of rageful
truth-telling would shame in advance any desire to make claims for the
tactical efficacy of suffering and mourning in the struggle to transform
the United States into a postracist nation. I cited Baldwin\'s text to
open this piece not to endorse its absolute truth but to figure its
frustrated opposition to the sentimental optimism that equates the
formal achievement of empathy on a mass scale with the general project
of democracy. Baldwin\'s special contribution to what
[sentimentality]{.underline} can mean [has been]{.underline} lost
[in]{.underline} the social-problem machinery of [mass
society]{.underline}, in which [the production of tears]{.underline}
where anger or nothing might have been [became more urgent with the
coming to cultural dominance of the Holocaust and trauma as models for
having and remembering collective social experience]{.underline}.20
Currently, as [in traditional sentimentality, the authenticity of
overwhelming pain that can be textually performed and shared is
disseminated as a prophylactic against the reproduction of a shocking
and numbing mass violence.]{.underline} Baldwin asserts that [**the
overvaluation of such redemptive feeling is** precisely **a condition of
that violence**]{.underline}**.** Baldwin\'s encounter with Stowe in
this essay comes amidst a general wave of protest novels, social-problem
films, and film noir in the U.S. after World War Two: Gentleman\'s
Agreement, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Best Years of Our Lives.
Films like these, he says, \"emerge for what they are: a mirror of our
confusion, dishonesty, panic, trapped and immobilized in the sunlit
prison of the American dream.\" [They cut the complexity of human
motives and self-understanding \"down to size\" by preferring \"a lie
more palatable than the truth\" about the social and material effects
the liberal pedagogy of optimism has, or doesn\'t have, on \"man\'s\"
capacity to produce a world of authentic truth, justice, and
freedom]{.underline}.21 Indeed, \"truth\" is the keyword for Baldwin. He
defines it as \"a devotion to the human being, his freedom and
fulfillment: freedom which cannot be legislated, fulfillment which
cannot be charted.\"22 In contrast, Stowe\'s totalitarian religiosity,
her [insistence that subjects \"bargain\" for]{.underline} heavenly
[redemption with their own]{.underline} physical and spiritual
[mortification, merely and violently confirms the fundamental abjection
of all persons, especially the black ones who wear the dark night of the
soul out where all can see it.]{.underline} Additionally, Baldwin argues
that Uncle Tom\'s Cabin instantiates a tradition of locating the destiny
of the nation in a false model of the individual soul, one imagined as
free of ambivalence, aggression, or contradiction. By \"human being\"
Baldwin means to repudiate stock identities as such, arguing that their
stark simplicity confirms the very fantasies and institutions against
which the sentimental is ostensibly being mobilized. [This
national-liberal refusal of complexity is what he elsewhere calls \"the
price of the ticket\" for membership in the American
dream.]{.underline}23 As the Uncle Tom films suggest, [whites need
blacks to \"dance\" for them so that they might continue disavowing the
costs or ghosts of whiteness, which involve religious traditions of
self-loathing and cultural traditions confusing happiness with
analgesia.]{.underline} The conventional reading of \"Everybody\'s
Protest Novel\" sees it as a violent rejection of the sentimental.24 It
is associated with the feminine (Little Women), with hollow and
dishonest capacities of feeling, with an aversion to the real pain that
real experience brings. \"Causes, as we know, are notoriously
bloodthirsty,\" he writes.25 [The politico-sentimental]{.underline}
novel [uses suffering vampirically to simplify the subject, thereby
making the injunction to empathy safe for the subject]{.underline}. Of
course there is more to the story. Baldwin bewails the senti- mentality
of Richard Wright\'s Native Son because Bigger Thomas is not the
homeopathic Other to Uncle Tom after all, but one of his \"children,\"
the heir to his negative legacy.26 Both Tom and Thomas live in a simple
relation to violence and die knowing only slightly more than they did
before they were sacrificed to a white ideal of the soul\'s simple
purity, its emptiness. [This addiction to the formula of redemption
through violent simplification persists with a \"terrible power\": it
confirms that U.S. minorities are constituted as Others even to
themselves through attachment to the most hateful, objectified,
cartoon-like versions of their identities, and that the shamed
subcultures of America really are, in some way, fully expressed by the
overpresence of the stereotypical image.]{.underline}

ideological horizon]{.underline}: the gap between (real) knowledge and
(symbolic) belief. We can illustrate it with the well-known
psychological experience of [when we say]{.underline} of something (as a
rule terrible, traumatic) [\"I know that it is so, but nevertheless I
can\'t believe it\": **the traumatic knowledge of reality remains
outside the Symbolic, the symbolic articulation continues to operate as
if we do not know**, and the \"time for understanding\" is necessary for
this knowledge to be integrated into our symbolic
universe.]{.underline}2 3 [This kind of gap between knowledge and
belief]{.underline}, in so far as both are \"conscious\", [attests to a
psychotic split, a \"disavowal of reality\"]{.underline}; propositions
of this type are what linguistic analysis calls \"pragmatic paradoxes\".
Let us take, for example, the statement \"I know that there is no mouse
in the next room, but nevertheless I believe that there is a mouse
there\": this statement is not logically irreconcilable - since there is
no logical contradiction between \"there is no mouse in the next room\"
and \"I believe there is a mouse in the next room\" - the contradiction
comes only on the pragmatic level, in so far as we take into account the
position of the subject of the enunciation of this proposition: the
subject who knows that there is no mouse in the next room cannot at the
same time, without contradiction, believe that there is a mouse there.
In other words, the subject who believes this is a split subject. [The
\"normal\" solution to this contradiction is of course that we repress
the other moment, the belief, in our unconscious]{.underline}: in its
place enters some spare moment which is not in contradiction to the
first - [this is the logic of so-called \"rationalization\". Instead of
the direct split \"I know that the Jews are guilty of nothing, but
nevertheless\... (I believe that they are guilty)\" comes the statement
of the type \"I know that the Jews are guilty of nothing; however, the
fact is that in the development of capitalism, the Jews, as the
representatives of financial and business capital, have usually profited
from the productive labour of others\"]{.underline}; instead of the
direct split \"I know that there is no God, but nevertheless\... (I
believe that there is)\" appears a statement of the type \"I know that
there is no God, but I respect religious ritual and take part in it
because this ritual supports ethical values and encourages brotherhood
and love among people.\" [Such statements are **good examples of what
might be called \"lying by way of the truth\": the second part of the
statement, the claim which follows the syntagm \"but nevertheless\...
\", can on a factual level be largely accurate but nevertheless operates
as a lie because in the concrete symbolic context in which it appears it
operates as a ratification of the unconscious belief** that the Jews are
nevertheless guilty]{.underline}, that God nevertheless exists, and so
on - without taking into account these \"investments\" of the
unconscious belief, the functioning of such statements remains totally
incomprehensible. [One of the greatest masters of this was the Stalinist
\"dialectical materialism\", the basic achievement of which, **when it
was necessary to legitimize some pragmatic political measure which
violated theoretical principles, was \"in principle it is of course so;
nevertheless, in the concrete circumstances\... \": the infamous
\"analysis of concrete circumstances\" is basically nothing other than a
search for rationalization which attempts to justify the violation of a
principle.** This gap between]{.underline} (real) [knowledge
and]{.underline} (symbolic[) belief determines our everyday ideological
attitude: \"I know that there is no God, but nevertheless, I operate as
if]{.underline} (I believe that) [he exists\"]{.underline} - the part in
brackets is repressed (belief in a God whom we witness through our
activity is unconscious).

[The Real of the Bomb reveals the incompleteness of this world
and]{.underline} **[motivates attempts to find what we imagine is
concealed beneath it]{.underline}**. [Nuclear obliteration
is]{.underline} to its devotees perhaps even [a promise of divine Truth
that offers transcendence of the fallen world of mediation in which
reality is never complete]{.underline}. With such a contradictory set of
attachments[, it is hard to imagine that efforts to think about the Bomb
can achieve their goals---while they might demonstrate their own
consistent logic, the rationality of nuclear politics is warped by the
intrusion of the Real and the desire to commune with it
directly]{.underline}. **[Communication studies is full of cogent
analyses of instances where language or other media worked very well
indeed to organize political responses, persuade audiences, bind people
together around texts, and change attitudes, but these accounts are
incomplete without attention to the Real]{.underline}**. The subject of
[nuclear war challenges how we think about communication itself and
demands new thinking on the limits of mediation]{.underline}. The
central question of this dissertation is [not how should we talk about
nuclear war,]{.underline} [but what can nuclear war show us about how we
attempt to mediate]{.underline} that which we understand to exceed the
limits of mediation itself? For attempt we do. The vertiginous hole in
the whole of reality is only the first part of the Bomb's relationship
to desire. Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does the symbolic order
through which the human world is built. The Symbolic, as Jacques Lacan
styles it, cannot tolerate the revelation of its inadequacy in the Real,
the tears left in our map by the inhuman world. We endlessly attempt to
heal the rifts of the Real, to feign unicity where it has failed
(Lundberg 2-3). [The response to chaos is control; order is imposed
against contingency in an effort to re-impose coherence.]{.underline}
This dynamic of automaton (order) scripted over tuché (contingency) is
developed in Chapter 2. When these attempts fail---and because the Real
by its nature cannot be assimilated, they must---we simply try again. In
Lacanian psychoanalysis, this dynamic is the repetition compulsion, in
which the subject tries again and again to control the conditions for
presence and absence, enjoying not the outcome but the exercise of
subjectivity itself in the capacity to act and to choose. Subjectivity
requires the sacrifice of continuity through the formation of the
alienating identity of the mirror phase, a process explained more in
Chapters 1 and 2. D[iscontinuous subjects are organized in part around
the lack---something that would make them whole again, represented in an
object that is never more than a partial stand-in for this missing
completion]{.underline}. Frustrated in the quest for something outside,
we enjoy our own subjectivity.2 [In the context of nuclear war, this
meant ever more sophisticated simulations of a phenomenon about which we
remained basically uncertain]{.underline}. This is the second movement
of desire in (or for) the Bomb. [The enjoyment]{.underline} of our
reasserted control over 2 "Enjoyment" [is]{.underline} meant here in
[the Lacanian sense of]{.underline} jouissance, not as happiness or
fulfillment, but as an attachment to [something that often exceeds
pleasure and manifests in quite harmful ways]{.underline}. [10 the Bomb
manifested in the repeated attempts to simulate its use and predict its
aftermath]{.underline}. The fort-da game described by Freud and
explained here in the first two chapters is an important tool for
unpacking this dynamic because it posits a sense of control over
presence and absence as the condition for a subject's enjoyment.
[Fort-da refers to the game in which a child makes an object disappear
and reappear in succession]{.underline}, simulating her or his mother's
coming and going and the possibility of her eventual disappearance.
Enjoyment comes from the subject's control over these states of presence
and absence, a small example of imposing order in a world of seeming
chaos (Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle 13-17). Understanding this
is necessary to draw the common threads between the cold-blooded
excesses of Pentagon nuclear plans, the compulsion that leads
survivalists to stockpile rooms full of MREs, and the appeal that
apocalyptic videogames hold for millions of players. [In
all]{.underline} of these [pursuits]{.underline}, [the world is made
absent in the fantasy of destruction and present again in the myth of
reconstruction, survival, and rebirth]{.underline}. **[Nuclear weapons
scholarship evinces its own compulsion to repeat: myriad investigations
of nuclear texts are done, but each leaves something
unanswered]{.underline}**. The movements of desire are incompletely by
scholarship on nuclear weapons concerned only with exposing the truths
of nuclear danger, analyzing specific instantiations of nuclear
rhetoric, or developing a vocabulary for democratic political
resistance. While the instrumental and political aspects of language are
important, to focus too narrowly on specific discourses threatens to
neglect the forest for the trees. The political movements that attracted
great attention in the 1980s---opposition to the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the Nuclear Freeze Movement, and the radical disarmament
movement---were at best partial successes. **[This is not to say that
these movements or]{.underline}** 11 **[their scholarly treatments are
unimportant---they are certainly helpful for those concerned with
nuclear activism and decisionmaking]{.underline}**. Still, even if we
slowly trace an asymptotic relation to the zero of nuclear desire, part
of the process is recognizing the pull this unattainable zero has on our
efforts to track it and how those investments sustain the larger
discourse of nuclear warfare. [That larger system persists almost
unchanged]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} thousands of weapons prepared
for launch on short notice, an [endless profusion of war
plans]{.underline}, an official policy to secure [peace through the
threat of genocide,]{.underline} and almost complete public ignorance
that the sword of Damocles still hangs from its slender thread. The
primary difference between nuclear awareness in 1985 and 2015 as it
relates to their own weapons is that ever fewer citizens of the nuclear
states even bother to check how much the rope is fraying. In other
words, the material artifice of nuclear warfighting persists despite
repeated attempts to understand its persuasive elements. **[Existing
attempts to study nuclear weapons could benefit from the concept of the
death drive as a problematic for communication studies]{.underline}**

#### IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVALUATE THE VALIDITY OF NUCLEAR THREATS SINCE EVERY FEAR OF INSTABILITY REINFORCES OUR SENSE OF UNREALITY WHICH, IN TURN, REINFORCES OUR COMMITMENT TO THE BOMB AS GOD.

Boulder, Nuclear Madness: on Religion and Psychology in the Nuclear Age,
p 22-23

[In relations between superpowers, not all fears are
ungrounded]{.underline}. It is plausible to suspect that most intentions
are empirically reciprocated. Moreover, as each side acts on its
fan­tasies of imperial omnipotence its behavior becomes increasing­ly
manipulative (which seems perfectly justified since other na­tions are
imagined to be merely inert things); naturally the ob­jects of this
manipulation oppose it and act to defend themselves. [But it is
pointless to argue about whether and when our political fears are
justified. Superpowers, like schizoids, assume that direct contact with
outside reality is dangerous; they avoid the danger by avoiding genuine
relationships with others and relating only to their fantasy images of
others. The content of those fantasies matters less than the mere fact
of substituting fantasy for reality.]{.underline} [Our nuclear
fantasies]{.underline}, like our nuclear arsenals, [are intend­ed to
create a wall of deterrence that wards off all reality and condemns us
to pure fantasy, leaving no way to test the actual­ity behind our
fears. Every fear, whether totally or only partially rooted in
fantasy, increases our sense of unreality]{.underline}. Every fear
reinforces the schizoid defenses that shut out reality and in­crease our
insecurity. This ever-deepening vicious spiral is the basic pattern of
schizoid life, a life in which every effort toward increased security
makes one less secure. [If the nuclear super­powers are living the same
kind of life in their Cold War rivalry]{.underline}, Laing\'s analysis
would go far toward resolving an enduring con­tradiction between nuclear
means and ends: [the more we de­pend on nuclear arsenals to protect
national security, the less secure we actually
feel, because]{.underline} (as most Americans readily admit) [the
weapons that we depend on to save us can only be used to
destroy]{.underline} us. As Laing\'s analysis proceeds to further
dimen­sions of the schizoid strategy, it leads deeper into this web of
contradiction.

**[Language penetrates all aspects of transversal struggles. Whatever we
think and do is framed by the language within which these acts are
carried out.]{.underline}** Hence, **[an engagement with the philosophy
of language must be part of an adequate approach to questions of agency
in global political]{.underline}** especially if this approach rests
upon a view of human life as constituted by self-understanding. **[From
such a vantage point language must be seen not as an image of the world
or a way of representing realities, but]{.underline}**, as
Wittgenstein's famous dictum holds, **[as 'part of an activity, a way of
life.']{.underline}** This position has far-reaching consequences. If
language expresses a particular way of life it is also responsible, at
least in part for the constitution of this way of life. **[Human agency
cannot take place outside language, in some pre-or extra-linguistic
realm. It can only take place through language.]{.underline}** Expressed
differently: languages age not just frameworks to assess actions. They
are themselves forms of action. There are, of course, countless domains
in which language interferes with transversal struggles. **[We live at a
time when ever increasing communicative capabilities account for an
ever-shrinking globe.]{.underline}** Moreover, transversal politics
revolves not only around interactions between various national
languages, but also between different types of speech. **[When a
liberal, a realist, a defense technician or a peace movement member
describes the same event, they use very different languages to interpret
the realities they see. Each of these languages has its own set of
rules. Each embodies a world-view that implicitly promotes certain
social values and certain political, ethical and spatial perceptions of
global politics. The clash between these forms of speech is the domain
where domination and resistance is carried out]{.underline}**. It is the
process that engenders human agency.

Debate is fundamentally an activity of various representations and
images---the affirmative chose to present the 1AC in the way that they
did, and those choices must be scrutinized. Their representations are
not ethical and you should vote negative to hold the affirmative
accountable for their choices.

#### The cases examined in this study attest to the importance of rep­resentational practices and the power that inheres in them. The infinity of traces that leave no inventory continue to play a significant part in contemporary constructions of "reality." This is not to suggest that representations have been static. Static implies the possi­bility of fixedness, when what I mean to suggest is an inherent fragility and instability to the meanings and identities that have been constructed in the various discourses I examined. For example, to characterize the South as "uncivilized" or "unfit for self---government\~\~ is no longer an acceptable representation. This is not, however, be­cause the meanings of these terms were at one time fixed and sta­ble. As I illustrated, what these signifiers signified was always deferred. Partial fixation was the result of their being anchored by some exemplary mode of being that was itself constructed at the power! knowledge nexus: the white male at the turn of the century, the United States after World War II. Bhabha stresses "the wide range of the stereotype, from the loyal servant to Satan, from the loved to the hated; a shifting of subject positions in the circulation of colonial power" (1983: 31). The shifting subject positions---from uncivilized native to quasi state to traditional "man" and society, for example are all partial fixations that have enabled the exercise of various and multiple forms of power. Nor do previous oppositions entirely disappear. What remains is an infinity of traces from prior repre­ sentations that themselves have been founded not on pure pres­ences but on differance. "The present becomes the sign of the sign, the trace of the trace," Derrida writes (1982: 24). Differance makes possible the chain of differing and deferring (the continuity) as well as the endless substitution (the discontinuity) of names that are in­scribed and reinscribed as pure presence, the center of the structure that itself escapes structurality. North-South relations have been constituted as a structure of deferral. The center of the structure (alternatively white man, modern man, the United States, the West, real states) has never been absolutely present outside a system of differences. It has itself been constituted as trace---the simulacrum of a presence that dislocates itself, displaces itself, refers itself (ibid.). **[Because the center is not a fixed locus but a function in which an infinite number of sign substitutions come into play, the domain and play of signification is extended indefinitely]{.underline}** (Derrida 1978: z8o). **[This]{.underline}** both opens up and limits possibilities, **[generates alternative sites of meanings and political resistances that give rise to practices of reinscription that seek to reaffirm identities and relationships]{.underline}**. The inherently incomplete and open nature of discourse makes this reaffirmation an ongoing and never finally completed project. In this study I have sought, **[through an engagement with various discourses in which claims to truth have been staked, to challenge the validity of the structures of meaning and to make visible their complicity with practices of power and domination]{.underline}**. By examining the ways in which structures of mean­ing have been associated with imperial practices, I have suggested that **[the construction of meaning and the construction of social, political, and economic power are inextricably linked. This suggests an ethical dimension to making meaning and an ethical imperative that is incumbent upon those who toil in the construction of structures of meaning.]{.underline}** This is especially urgent in North-South relations today: **[one does not have to search very far to find a continuing complicity with colonial representations that ranges from a politics of silence and neglect to constructions of terrorism, Islamic fundamentalism, international drug trafficking, and Southern immigration to the North as new threats to global stability and peace.]{.underline}** The political stakes raised by this analysis revolve around the question of being able to "get beyond" the representations or speak outside of the discourses that historically have constructed the North and the South. I do not believe that there are any pure alternatives by which we can escape the infinity of traces to which Gramsci refers. Nor do I wish to suggest that we are always hopelessly imprisoned in a dominant and all-pervasive discourse. Before this question can be answered---indeed, before we can even proceed to attempt an answer---attention must be given to the politics of representation. **[The price that international relations scholarship pays for its inattention to the issue of representation is perpetuation of the dominant modes of making meaning and deferral of its responsibility and complicity in dominant representations]{.underline}**.

#### Key to the alt - recognizing this is fantasy and criticizing the discourse surrounding the threat of war is key to total denuclearization

[Abbott 2008]{.underline} (Tristan, Department of English Language and
Literature, University of Northern Iowa ; \"Bomb Media, 1953--1964\":
Postmodern Culture Volume 18, Number 3, May 2008: MUSE)

####  **[The nuclear question is one of discourse]{.underline}**, as Jacques Derrida points out in his seminal "No Apocalypse, Not Now," in which he lays the foundation for nuclear criticism by pointing out that **[nuclear war was "fabulously textual, through and through]{.underline}**" (23). **[This fabulous textuality is due to nuclear war's being without precedent, having never happened and existing only as an intangible, envisioned threat---"a signified referent]{.underline}**." **[This imagined threat of war]{.underline}**, Derrida realizes, **[led to a reality (consisting of nuclear stockpiles and weapons systems]{.underline}** and people who were, conceivably, willing to use them) **[that]{.underline}** **[legitimized the imagined threat upon which their existence was predicated]{.underline}**. Derrida focuses on nuclear war's threat to completely annihilate not just civilization and not even just humanity, but the referential archive according to which all of everyone's understanding of everything is based. **[It is because of this unique ability to annihilate the archive that nuclear war is,]{.underline}** according to Derrida, **[the only "real" referent:]{.underline}** If we are bound and determined to speak in terms of reference, nuclear **[war is the only possible referent of any discourse and any experience that would share their condition with that of literature]{.underline}**. If . . . nuclear war is equivalent to the total destruction of the archive . . . it becomes the absolute referent, the horizon and the condition of all others. \[It is\] the only "subject" of all possible literature, of all possible criticism. This concept is the primary concern of Derrida's piece and of the bulk of nuclear criticism that followed. **[That is why most nuclear criticism does not focus on texts that deal with explicitly nuclear subject matter.]{.underline}** Really, such observations might well have been made about any other imaginable context that would have involved the destruction of the referential archive. The purpose and function of the nuclear critical field was never agreed upon. Nearly **[all pieces of nuclear criticism]{.underline}**, however, feature **[some discussion meant to criticize, debunk, or mock the pitiful self-feeding false logic of deterrence through mutual destruction that marked the officially promulgated nuclear discourse of the 80s,]{.underline}** hoping to "renounce the alarmism and moralism that contributed to the escalation of rhetorical stockpiles" (Luckhurst, 90) that in turn gave currency to the threat of nuclear annihilation. This is what I would like to borrow from nuclear criticism---**[this valuable, undeniable realization that nuclear war is a phantom, something that became an actual threat only after being conjured up as an abstraction and that becomes]{.underline}** more of **[an eventuality the more it is debated and discussed. Once this textuality is realized, its importance in shaping both nuclear discourse and the realities]{.underline}** **[(]{.underline}**a/**[e)ffected by that discourse are undeniable]{.underline}**, as is its importance regarding texts that aim to prevent nuclear destruction. **[It is only after these realizations have been made that one can attempt to weaken the legitimizing power of nuclear rhetoric.]{.underline}** 

Also key to resolve the impacts by having new Counterhegmonic Frameworks

**[The domain of global politics contains an unlimited number of
terrains that offer possibilities for linguistic forms of dissent to
interfere with the course of transversal struggles.]{.underline}**
Before scrutinising a particular, linguistically based site of
transversal dissent (the subject of the subsequent chapter), it is
necessary to theorise in more detail how the written word offers
opportunities to engender human agency. For this purpose an engagement
with the work of Theodor Adorno is useful, particularly with his reading
of Nietzsche. Adorno is ideally suited for this task because he
epitomises both the strengths and dangers of writing dissent. Adorno\'s
approach to **[language]{.underline}** emerges out of opposition to what
he calls identity thinking. \'To think,\' he claims, \'is to identify.\'
[37](http://www.questia.com/read/105471293#37) It **[is a process
through which we try to understand the bewildering world that surrounds
us.]{.underline}** Thinking expresses a will to truth, a desire to
control and impose order upon random and idiosyncratic events. **[When
we think we identify choices, privilege one interpretation over others,
and]{.underline}**, often without knowing it, **[exclude what does not
fit into the way we want to see things.]{.underline}** There is no
escape from the subjective dimension of thought, no possibility of
extracting pure facts from observation. **[Thinking cannot be done
without language. And language]{.underline}**, of course, **[has always
already established a preconceived conceptual order prior to what
thinking is trying to understand.]{.underline}**
[38](http://www.questia.com/read/105471293#38) In fact, Adorno **[even
claims that before dealing with specific speech contents, languages
mould a thought such that it gets drawn into subordination even where it
appears to resist this tendency.]{.underline}**
[39](http://www.questia.com/read/105471293#39) Identity thinking, he
points out, is the form of thinking that ignores these unavoidable
socio-linguistic restraints. It embarks on a fatal search for essences,
seeks to extract the general out of the particular and thus forces
unique things into an artificial unitary system of thought. But
thinking, Adorno claims, is not only obeying the power of language and
discourse. **[Thinking]{.underline}** also **[contains critical
potential, for it is in itself already a process of negating, of
resisting what is forced upon it. Stretching the boundaries of language
games]{.underline}**, engaging in Sprachkritik, **[is the key to
realising this potential. It permits us to break loose from the claws of
the established order and to venture beyond the givenness of
life.]{.underline}** Adorno\'s conceptual starting point for this
journey is negative dialectics, the refusal to subsume the particular
under the general. This entails creating thinking space without
succumbing to the temptation of searching for a Hegelean synthesis, a
new totalising and exclusionary system of thought that would drift us
back into the dangerous waters of identity thinking. **[Negative
dialectics is the constant awareness of non-identity. It refuses to rely
upon a preconceived standpoint. It rescues and develops what does not
fit into prevailing totalising practices or what may emerge as a
potential alternative to them.]{.underline}**
[41](http://www.questia.com/read/105471294#41) Adorno tries to open up
such thinking spaces through a critique of language that calls for a
radical departure from both the traditional usage of concepts and the
style in which they are presented.

### Reps Good

#### Reps don\'t shape reality

**Balzacq 5**---Thierry, Professor of Political Science and
International Relations at Namur University \["The Three Faces of
Securitization: Political Agency, Audience and Context" European Journal
of International Relations, London: Jun 2005, Volume 11, Issue 2\] Jeong

However, despite important insights, this position remains highly
disputable. The reason behind this qualification is not hard to
understand. With great trepidation my contention is that [one of the
main distinctions we need to take into account while examining
securitization is that between \'institutional\' and \'brute\' threats.
In its attempts to follow a]{.underline} more [radical approach to
security problems where]{.underline}in [threats are]{.underline}
institutional, that is, [mere products of communicative
relations]{.underline} between agents, the [CS has neglected the
importance of \'external]{.underline} or brute threats\', that is,
[threats that **do not depend** on language mediation to be]{.underline}
[what they are]{.underline} - [hazards for human life. In methodological
terms]{.underline}, however, [any framework
over-emphasizing]{.underline} either [institutional]{.underline} or
brute [threat risks losing sight of important aspects of a
**multifaceted phenomenon**]{.underline}. Indeed, securitization, as
suggested earlier, is successful when the securitizing agent and the
audience reach a common structured perception of an ominous development.
In this scheme, there is no security problem except through the language
game. Therefore, [how problems are \'out there\' is exclusively
contingent upon how we linguistically depict them.]{.underline} This [is
not always true]{.underline}. For one, [language **does not construct**
reality; at best, it shapes our perception of it]{.underline}. Moreover,
[it is **not theoretically useful** nor]{.underline} is it
[**empirically credible** to hold that what we say about a problem would
determine its essence]{.underline}. For instance, [what I say about a
typhoon would not change its essence]{.underline}. The consequence of
this position, which would require a deeper articulation, is that [some
security problems are the attribute of the development
itself]{.underline}. In short, [threats are not only institutional; some
of them can actually wreck entire political communities **regardless
of** the use of language]{.underline}. [Analyzing security problems then
becomes a matter of understanding how external contexts, including
external objective developments, affect securitization.]{.underline}
Thus, far from being a departure from constructivist approaches to
security, [external developments are central to it.]{.underline}

#### Our depictions [do NOT desensitize]{.underline} AND -- the ALT's [worse]{.underline}

**Chernus 3** (Ira Chernus, Prof of Religious Studies at UC Boulder,
"Bring Back the Body Count," 4-1-2003,
http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0401-12.htm)

\"We don\'t do body counts,\" says America\'s soldier-in-chief, Tommy
Franks. That\'s a damn shame. During the Vietnam war, the body count was
served up every day on the evening news. While Americans ate dinner,
they watched a graphic visual scorecard: how many Americans had died
that day, how many South Vietnamese, and how many Communists. At the
time, it seemed the height of dehumanized violence. Compared to Tommy
Franks\' new way of war, though, the old way looks very humane indeed.
[True, the body count turned human beings into abstract numbers. But it
required soldiers to say]{.underline} to the world, \"Look everyone. [I
killed human beings today. This is exactly how many I killed. I am
obliged to count each and every one]{.underline}.\" [It demanded that
the killers look at what they had done, think about it (however
briefly), and acknowledge their deed. It was a way of taking
responsibility. Today\'s killers avoid that responsibility. They
perpetuate the fiction so many Americans want to believe-that no real
people die in war, that it\'s just an exciting video game. It\'s not
merely the dead who disappear; it\'s the act of killing
itself]{.underline}. When the victim\'s family holds up a picture, U.S.
soldiers or journalists can simply reply \"Who\'s that? We have no
record of such a person. In fact, we have no records at all. [We kill
and move on. No time to keep records]{.underline}. No inclination. No
reason.\" [This is not just a matter of new technology. There was plenty
of long-distance impersonal killing in Vietnam too. But back then, the
U.S. military at least went through the motions of going in to see what
they had done. True, the investigations were often cursory and the
numbers often fictional. No matter how inaccurate the numbers were,
though, the message to the public every day was that each body should be
counted. At some level, at least, each individual life seemed to
matter]{.underline}. The difference between Vietnam and Iraq lies partly
in overall strategy. In Vietnam, there was no territory to be conquered
and occupied. If U.S. forces seized an area, they knew that sooner or
later the Viet Cong would take it back. The only way to measure
\"victory\" was by killing more of them than they killed of us. In Iraq,
the goal is control of place. U.S. forces can \"take\" Basra or
Nassiriya and call it a victory, without ever thinking about how many
Iraqis had to be killed in the process. So the body count matters less.
However, the end of body counts can not be explained simply by the
difference in strategy. The old-fashioned body counts disappeared during
the first war against Iraq, when the goal was still defined by
territory: pushing Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. So [It\'s much more
likely that \"we don\'t do body counts\" because Vietnam proved how
embarrassing they could be. As the U.S. public turned against that war,
the body count became a symbol of everything that was inhumane and
irrational about that war. The Pentagon fears that the same might
happen]{.underline} if the Iraq war bogs down. [How much simpler to deny
the inhumanity and irrationality of war by denying the obvious fact of
slaughter. What I fear is a world where thousands can be killed and no
one is responsible, where deaths are erased from history as soon as they
happen. The body count was more than an act of responsibility. It was a
permanent record. It made each death a historical fact]{.underline}. You
can go back and graph those Vietnam deaths from day to day, month to
month, year to year. [That turns the victims into nameless, faceless
abstractions. But it least it confirms for ever and ever that they lived
and died, because someone took the time to kill and count
them]{.underline}. In Iraq, it is as if the killing never happened.
[When a human being\'s death is erased from history, so is their
life]{.underline}. Life and death together vanish without a trace. The
body count has one other virtue. It is enemy soldiers, not civilians,
who are officially counted. Antiwar activists rightly warn about
civilian slaughter and watch the toll rise at www.iraqbodycount.org. It
is easy to forget that the vast majority of Iraqi dead and wounded will
be soldiers. Most of them were pressed into service, either by brute
force or economic necessity. As the whole world has been telling us for
months, there is no good reason for this war, no good reason for those
hapless Iraqi foot-soldiers to die. They are victims of
brutality-inflicted by their own government and by ours-just as much as
the civilians. They deserve just as much to be counted [So let us bring
back the body count. If we must kill, let us kill as one human being to
another, recognizing the full humanity of our victims. Without a body
count, our nation becomes more of a robotic killing machine. As we
dehumanize Iraqis, we slip even further into our own dehumanization. Let
us bring back the body count. if only to recover our own sense of
responsibility to the world\'s people, to history, to our own
humanity]{.underline}.

At this naked moment in the American experiment, when many people
perceive civilization on the verge of blowing up in some metaphorical
sense, there is an elderly man in California hoping to seize your
attention about another possibility. It is that [civilization is on the
verge of blowing up]{.underline} in a non-metaphorical sense. William J.
Perry is 89 now, at the tail end of one of his generation's most
illustrious careers in national security. By all rights, the former U.S.
secretary of Defense, a trained mathematician who served or advised
nearly every administration since Eisenhower, should be filling out the
remainder of his years in quiet reflection on his achievements. Instead,
he has set out on an urgent pilgrimage. [Bill Perry has
become]{.underline}, he says with a rueful smile, "[a prophet of
doom.]{.underline}" [His life's work]{.underline}, most of it highly
classified, [was nuclear weapons]{.underline}---how to maximize the
fearsome deterrent power of the U.S. arsenal, how to minimize the
possibility that the old Soviet arsenal would obliterate the United
States and much of the planet along the way. Perry played a supporting
role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, during which he went back to his
Washington hotel room each night, fearing he had only hours left to
live. He later founded his own successful defense firm, helped
revolutionize the American way of high-tech war, and honed his
diplomatic skills seeking common ground on security issues with the
Soviets and Chinese---all culminating as head of the Pentagon in the
early years after the end of the Cold War. Nuclear bombs are an area of
expertise Perry had assumed would be largely obsolete by now, seven
decades after Hiroshima, a quarter-century after the fall of the Soviet
Union, and in the flickering light of his own life. Instead, [nukes are
suddenly---insanely, by Perry's estimate---once again a contemporary
nightmare, and an emphatically ascendant one. At the dawn of 2017, there
is a Russian president making bellicose boasts about his modernized
arsenal. There is an American president-elect who breezily
free-associates on Twitter about starting a new nuclear arms race.
Decades of cooperation between the two nations on arms control is nearly
at a standstill. And, unlike the original Cold War, this time there is a
world of busy fanatics excited by the prospect of a planet with more
bombs---people who have already demonstrated the desire to slaughter
many thousands of people in an instant, and are zealously pursuing ever
more deadly means to do so]{.underline}. [And there's one other
difference from the Cold War: Americans no longer think about the threat
every day]{.underline}. [Nuclear war isn't the subtext]{.underline} of
popular movies, or novels; [disarmament has fallen far from the top of
the policy priority list. The largest upcoming generation, the
millennials, were raised in a time when the problem felt largely solved,
and it's easy for them to imagine it's still quietly fading into
history. The problem is, it's no longer fading. "Today, the danger of
some sort of a nuclear catastrophe is greater than it was during the
Cold War," Perry said in an interview in his Stanford office, "and most
people are blissfully unaware of this danger."]{.underline} It is a turn
of events that has an old man newly obsessed with a question: Why isn't
everyone as terrified as he is? Perry's hypothesis for the disconnect is
that [much of the population, especially that rising portion with no
clear memories of the first Cold War, is suffering from a deficit of
comprehension. Even a single nuclear explosion in a major city would
represent an abrupt and possibly irreversible turn in modern life,
upending the global economy, forcing every open society to suspend
traditional liberties and remake itself into a security state. "The
political, economic and social consequences are beyond what people
understand," Perry says. And yet many people place this scenario in
roughly the same category as the meteor strike that supposedly wiped out
the dinosaurs---frightening, to be sure, but something of an
abstraction]{.underline}. So Perry regards his last great contribution
of a 65-year career as [a crusade to stimulate the public
imagination]{.underline}---to share the vivid details of his own
nightmares. He is doing so in a recent memoir, in a busy public speaking
schedule, in half-empty hearing rooms on Capitol Hill, and increasingly
with an online presence [aimed especially at young people]{.underline}.
He has enlisted the help of his 28-year-old granddaughter to figure out
how to engage a new generation, including through a series of virtual
lectures known as a MOOC, or massive open online course. He is eagerly
signing up for "Ask Me Anything" chats on Reddit, in which some people
still confuse him with William "The Refrigerator" Perry of NFL fame. He
posts his ruminations on YouTube, where they give Katy Perry no run for
her money, even as the most popular are closing in on 100,000 views. One
of the nightmare scenarios Perry invokes most often is designed to roust
policymakers who live and work in the nation's capital. The terrorists
would need enriched uranium. Due to the elaborate and highly industrial
nature of production, hard to conceal from surveillance, fissile
material is still hard to come by---but, alas, far from impossible. Once
it is procured, with help from conspirators in a poorly secured overseas
commercial power centrifuge facility, the rest of the plot as Perry
imagines it is no great technological or logistical feat. The mechanics
of building a crude nuclear device are easily within the reach of
well-educated and well-funded militants. The crate would arrive at
Dulles International Airport, disguised as agricultural freight. The
truck bomb that detonates on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House
and Capitol instantly kills the president, vice president, House
speaker, and 80,000 others. Where exactly is your office? Your house?
And then, as Perry spins it forward, how credible would you find the
warnings, soon delivered to news networks, that five more bombs are set
to explode in unnamed U.S. cities, once a week for the next month,
unless all U.S. military personnel overseas are withdrawn immediately?
[If this particular scenario does not resonate with you, Perry can
easily rattle off a long roster of others]{.underline}---a regional war
that escalates into a nuclear exchange, a miscalculation between Moscow
and Washington, a computer glitch at the exact wrong moment. [They are
all ilks of the same theme---the dimly understood threat that the
science of the 20th century is set to collide with the destructive
passions of the 21st.]{.underline} "We're going back to the kind of
dangers we had during the Cold War," Perry said. "I really thought in
1990, 1991, 1992, that we left those behind us. We're starting to
re-invent them. [We and the Russians and others don't understand that
what we're doing is re-creating those dangers---or maybe they don't
remember the dangers. For younger people, they didn't live through those
dangers]{.underline}. But when you live through a Cuban Missile Crisis
up close and you live through a false alarm up close, you do understand
how dangerous it is, and you believe you should do everything you could
possibly do to \[avoid\] going back." For people who follow the national
security priesthood, the dire scenarios are all the more alarming for
who is delivering them. Through his long years in government Perry
invariably impressed colleagues as the calmest person in the room,
relentlessly rational, such that people who did not know him well---his
love of music and literature and travel---regarded his as a purely
analytical mind, emotion subordinated to logic and duty. Starting in the
1950s as a technology executive and entrepreneur in some of the most
secretive precincts of the defense industry, he gradually took on a
series of high-level government assignments that gave him one of the
most quietly influential careers of the Cold War and its aftermath.
Fifteen years before serving as Bill Clinton's secretary of defense,
Perry was the Pentagon official in charge of weapons research during the
Carter administration. It was from this perch that he may have had his
most far-reaching impact, and left him in some circles as a legendary
figure. He used his office to give an essential push to two ideas that
transformed warfare over the next generation decisively to American
advantage. One idea was stealth technology, which allowed U.S. warplanes
to fly over enemy territory undetected. The other was precision-guided
munitions, which allowed U.S. bombs to land with near-perfect accuracy.
During the Clinton years, Perry so prized his privacy that he initially
turned down the job of Defense secretary---changing his mind only after
Clinton and Al Gore pleaded with him that the news media scrutiny
wouldn't be so bad. The reputation he built over a life in the public
sphere is starkly at odds with this latest highly impassioned chapter of
Perry's career. Harold Brown, who also is 89, first recruited Perry into
government, and was Perry's boss while serving as Defense secretary in
the Carter years. "No one would have thought of Bill Perry as a
crusader," he says. "But he is on a crusade." Lee Perry, his wife of
nearly 70 years, is living in an elder care facility, her once buoyant
presence now lost to dementia. Perry himself, lucid as ever, has seen
his physical frame become frail and stooped. Rather than slowing his
schedule, he has accelerated his travels to plead with people to awaken
to the danger. A trip to Washington includes a dinner with national
security reporters and testimony on Capitol Hill. Back home in
California, he's at the Google campus to prod engineers to contemplate
that their world may not last long enough for their dreams of technology
riches to come true. He's created an advocacy group, the William J.
Perry project, devoted to public education about nuclear weapons. He's
enlisted both his granddaughter and his 64-year-old daughter, Robin
Perry, in the cause. But if his profile is rising, his style is
essentially unchanged. He is a man known for self-effacement, trying to
shape an era known for relentless self-promotion, a voice of quiet
precision in a time of devil-take-the-hindmost bombast. The rational
approach to problem-solving that propelled his career and won him
adherents and friends in both political parties and even among some of
America's erstwhile enemies remains his guide---in this case, by
endeavoring to calculate the possibilities and probabilities of a
terrorist attack, regional nuclear war, or horrible miscalculation with
Russia. ["I want to be very clear," he said. "I do not think it is a
probability this year or next year or anytime in the foreseeable future.
But the consequence is so great, we have to take it seriously. And there
are things to greatly lower those possibilities that we're simply not
doing."]{.underline} \*\*\* Perry really did not expect he would have to
write this chapter of his public life. His official career closed with
what seemed then an unambiguous sense of mission accomplished. By the
time he arrived in the Pentagon's top job in 1994, the Cold War was
over, and the main item on the nuclear agenda seemed to be cleaning up
no-longer-needed arsenals. As defense secretary, Perry stood with his
Russian counterpart, Pavel Grachev, as they jointly blew up missile
silos in the former Soviet Union and tilled sunflower seeds in the dirt.
"I finally thought by the end of the '80s we lived through this horrible
experience and it's behind us," Perry said. "When I was secretary, I
fully believed it was behind us." After leaving the Pentagon, he
accepted an assignment from Clinton to negotiate an end to North Korea's
nuclear development program---and seemed agonizingly close to a
breakthrough as the last days of the president's term expired. Now, he
sees his grandchildren inheriting a planet possibly more dangerous than
it was during his public career. No one could doubt that [the Sept. 11
terrorists would have gladly used nuclear bombs instead of airplanes if
they had had them, and it seems only a matter of time until they try.
Instead of a retreating threat in North Korea]{.underline}, that
fanatical regime [now possesses as many as eight nuclear bombs, and is
just one member of a growing nuclear club]{.underline}. Far from a new
partnership with Russia, Vladimir [Putin has given old antagonisms a
malevolent new face. American policymakers talk of spending up to \$1
trillion to modernize the nuclear arsenal. And now comes Donald Trump
with a long trail of statements effectively shrugging his shoulders
about a world newly bristling with bombs and people with reasons to use
them]{.underline}. Perry knew Hillary Clinton well professionally, and
says he admired both her and Bill Clinton for their professional
judgment though he was never a personal intimate of either. He was
prescient before the election in expressing skepticism about how voters
would respond to the dynastic premise of the Clinton campaign---a
healthy democracy should grow new voices---but was as surprised as
everyone else on Election Day. Donald Trump was not the voice he was
looking for, to put it mildly, but he has responded to the Trump cyclone
with modulated restraint. Perry said he assumes his most truculent
rhetoric isn't serious, the utterances of a man who assumed his words
were for political effect only and had no real consequences. Now that
they do, Perry is hoping to serve as a kind of ambassador to
rationality. He said he is hoping for audiences soon, with Trump if the
incoming president will see him, and certainly Trump's national security
team, which includes several people Perry knows, including Defense
Secretary nominee James Mattis. There is little doubt the message if the
meeting comes. "We are starting a new Cold War," he says. "We seem to be
sleepwalking into this new nuclear arms race. ... We and the Russians
and others don't understand what we are doing." "I am not suggesting
that this Cold War and this arms race is identical to the old one,"
Perry added. "But in many ways, it is just as bad, just as dangerous.
And totally unnecessary." \*\*\* Perry had been brooding over the
question for a year. It was in the early 1950s, he was still in his 20s,
and the subject was partial differential equations---the topic of his
Ph.D. thesis. A particular problem had been absorbing him, day in and
day out, hours and hours on end. Then, out of nowhere, a light came on.
"I woke up in the middle of the night, and it was all there," Perry
recalled. "It was all there, and I got out of bed and sat down. The next
two or three hours, I wrote my thesis, and from the first word I wrote
down, I never doubted what the last word was going to be: It was a magic
moment." The story is a reminder of something definitional about Bill
Perry. Before he became in recent years an apostle of disarmament,
before he sat atop the nation's war-making apparatus in the 1990s,
before he was the executive of a defense contractor specializing in the
most complex arenas of Cold War surveillance in the 1960s, he was a
young man in love with mathematics. In those days, Perry had planned on
a career as a math professor. His attraction to math was not merely
practical, in the way that engineers or architects rely on math. The
appeal was just as much aesthetic, in ways that people who are not
numbers people---political life tends to be dominated by word
people---cannot easily comprehend. To Perry's mind, there was a purity
to math, a beauty to the patterns and relationships, that was not unlike
music. Math for Perry represented analytical discipline, a way of
achieving mastery not only over numerical problems but any hard problem,
by breaking it down into essential parts, distilling complexity into
simplicity. This trait was why Pentagon reporters in the 1990s liked
spending time around Perry. When most public officials are asked a
question, one studies the transcript later to decipher a succession of
starts and stalls, sentence fragments and ellipses, that cumulatively
convey an impressionistic sense of mind but no clear fixed meaning.
Perry's sentences, by contrast, always cut with surgical precision. It
was one reason Clinton White House officials often held their breath
when he gave interviews---Perry might make news by being clear on
subjects, such as ethnic warfare in the Balkans or a nuclear showdown in
North Korea, that the West Wing preferred to try to fog over. "I've
never been able to attack a policy problem with a mathematical formula,"
he recalled, "but I have always believed that the rigorous way of
thinking about a problem was good. It separated the fact from the
bullshit, and that's very important sometimes, to separate what you can
from what you would hope you can do." [Perry wishes more people were
familiar with the concept of "expected value." That is a statistical way
of understanding events of very large magnitude that have a low
probability. The large magnitude event could be something good, like
winning a lottery ticket. Or it could be something bad, like a nuclear
bomb exploding. Because the odds of winning the lottery are so low, the
rational thing is to save your money and not buy the ticket. As for a
nuclear explosion, by Perry's lights, the consequences are so grave that
the rational thing would be for people in the United States and
everywhere to be in a state of peak alarm about their vulnerability, and
for political debate to be dominated by discussion of how to reduce the
risk]{.underline}. [And just how high is the risk? The answer of course
is ultimately unknowable. Perry's point, though, is that it's a hell of
a lot higher than you think. Perry invites his listeners to consider all
the various scenarios that might lead to a nuclear event.
"Mathematically speaking, you add those all together in one year it is
still just a possibility, not a probability]{.underline}," he reckons.
"[But then you go out ten, twenty years and each time this possibility
repeats itself, and then it starts to become a probability. How much
time we have to get those possibility numbers lower, I don't know. But
sooner or later the odds are going to get us, I am afraid]{.underline}."
\*\*\* Almost uniquely among living Americans, Bill Perry has actually
faced down the prospect of nuclear war before---twice. In the fall of
1962, Bill Perry was 35, father of five young children, living in the
Bay Area and serving as director of Sylvania's Electronic Defense
Laboratories---driving his station wagon to recitals in between studying
missile trajectories and the radius of nuclear detonations. Where he
resided was not then called Silicon Valley, but the exuberance and
spirit of creative possibility we now associate with the region was
already evident. The giants then were Bill Hewlett and David Packard,
men Perry deeply admired and wished to emulate in his own business
career. The innovation engine at that time, however, was not consumer
technology; it was the government's appetite for advantage in a mortal
struggle against a powerful Soviet foe. Perry was known as a star in the
highly complex field of weapons surveillance and interpretation. So it
was not a surprise, one bright October day, for Perry to get a call from
Albert "Bud" Wheelon, a friend at the Central Intelligence Agency.
Wheelon said he wanted Perry in Washington for a consultation. Perry
said he'd juggle his schedule and be there the next week. "No," Wheelon
responded. "I need to see you right away." Perry caught the red-eye from
San Francisco, and went straight to the CIA, where he was handed
photographs whose meaning was instantly clear to him. They were of
Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba. For the next couple weeks, Perry
would stay up past midnight each evening poring over the latest
reconnaissance photos and help write the analysis that senior officials
would present the next morning to President Kennedy. Perry experienced
the crisis partly as ordinary citizen, hearing Kennedy on television
draw an unambiguous line against Soviet missiles in this hemisphere and
promising that any attack would be met with "a full retaliatory
response." But he possessed context, about the capabilities of weapons
and the daily state of play in the crisis, that gave him a vantage point
superior to that of all but perhaps a few dozen people. "I was part of a
small team---six or eight people," he recounted of those days 54 years
earlier. "Half of them technical experts, half of them intelligence
analysts, or photo interpreters. It was a minor role but I was seeing
all the information coming in. I thought every day when I went back to
the hotel it was the last day of my life because I knew exactly what
nuclear weapons could do. I knew it was not just a lot of people getting
killed. It was the end of civilization and I thought it was about to
happen." It was years later that Perry, like other more senior
participants in the crisis, learned how right that appraisal was.
Nuclear bombs weren't only heading toward Cuba on Soviet ships, as
Kennedy believed and announced to Americans at the time. Some of them
were already there, and local commanders had been given authority to use
them if Americans launched a preemptive raid on Cuba, as Kennedy was
being urged, goaded even, by Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay and other
military commanders. At the same time, Soviet submarines were armed and
one commander had been on the verge of launching them until other
officers on the vessel talked him out of it. Either event would have in
turn sent U.S. missiles flying. The Cuban Missile Crisis recounting is
one of the dramatic peaks in "My Journey on the Nuclear Brink," the
memoir Perry published last fall. It is a book laced with other close
calls---like November 9, 1979, when Perry was awakened in the middle of
the night by a watch officer at the North American Aerospace and Defense
Command (NORAD) reporting that his computers showed 200 Soviet missiles
in flight toward the United States. For a frozen moment, Perry thought:
This is it---This is how it ends. The watch officer soon set him at
ease. It was a computer error, and he was calling to see whether Perry,
the technology expert, had any explanation. It took a couple days to
discover the low-tech answer: Someone had carelessly left a
crisis-simulation training tape in the computer. All was well. But what
if this blunder had happened in the middle of a real crisis, with
leaders in Washington and Moscow already on high alert? The inescapable
conclusion was the same as it was in 1962: [The world skirting nuclear
Armageddon as much by good luck as by skilled crisis
management.]{.underline} Perry is part of a distinct cohort in American
history, one that didn't come home with the large-living ethos of the
World War II generation, but took responsibility for cleaning up the
world that the war bequeathed. He was a 14-year-old in Butler,
Pennsylvania when he heard the news of the Pearl Harbor attack in a
friend's living room, and had the disappointed realization that the war
might be over by the time he was old enough to fight in it. That turned
out to be true---he was just shy of 18 at war's end---a fact that places
Perry in what demographers have called the "Silent Generation," too
young for one war but already middle-aged by the time college campuses
erupted over Vietnam. Like many in his generation, Perry was not so much
silent as deeply dutiful, with an understated style that served as a
genial, dry-witted exterior to a life in which success was defined by
how faithfully one met his responsibilities. Perry said he became aware,
first gradually and over time profoundly, of the surreal contradictions
of his professional life. His work---first at Sylvania and then at ESL,
a highly successful defense contracting firm he co-founded in 1963---was
relentlessly logical, analyzing Soviet threats and intentions and coming
up with rational responses to deter them. But each rational move was
part of a supremely irrational dynamic---"mutually assured
destruction"---that placed the threat of massive casualties at the heart
of America's basic strategic thinking. It was the kind of framework in
which policymakers could accept that a mere 25 million people dead was
good news. Also the kind that in one year alone led the United States to
produce 8,000 nuclear bombs. By the end, the Cold War left the planet
with about 70,000 bombs (a total that is now down to about 15,500). "I
think probably everybody who was involved in nuclear weapons in those
days would see the two sides of it," Perry recalls, "the logic of
deterrence and the madness of deterrence, and there was no mistake, I
think, that the acronym was MAD." \*\*\* Perry has been at the forefront
of a movement that he considers the sane and only alternative, and he
has joined forces with other leading Cold Warriors who in another era
would likely have derided their vision as naïve. In January 2007, he was
a co-author of a remarkable commentary that ran on the op-ed page of the
Wall Street Journal. It was signed also by two former secretaries of
state, George Schulz and Henry Kissinger and by Sam Nunn, a former
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee---all leading military
hawks and foreign policy realists who came together to argue for
something radical: that [the goal of U.S. policy should be]{.underline}
not merely the reduction and control of atomic arms, it should be [the
ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons]{.underline}. This sounded
like gauzy utopianism, especially bizarre coming from supremely
pragmatic men. But Perry and the others always made clear they were
describing a long-term ideal, one that would only be achieved through a
series of more incremental steps. The vision was stirring enough that it
was endorsed by President Obama in his opening weeks in office, in a
March 2009 address in Prague. In retrospect, Obama's speech may have
been the high point for the vision of abolition. "A huge amount of
progress was made," recalled Shultz, now 93. "[Now it is going in the
other direction]{.underline}." "We have less danger of an all-out war
with Russia," in Nunn's view. "But [we have more danger of some type of
accident, miscalculation, cyber interference, a terrorist group getting
a nuclear weapon. It requires a lot more attention than world leaders
are giving it.]{.underline}" Perry's goal now is much more defensive
than it was just a few years ago---halting what has become inexorable
momentum toward reviving Cold War assumptions about the central role of
nukes in national security. More recently he's added yet another recruit
to his cause: California Governor Jerry Brown. Brown, now 78, met Perry
a year ago, after deciding that he wanted to devote his remaining time
in public service mainly to what he sees as civilization's two
existential issues, climate change and nuclear weapons. Brown said he
became fixated on spreading Perry's message after reading his memoir: He
recently gave a copy to President Obama and is trying to bend the ear of
others with influence in Washington. If Bill Perry has a gift for
understatement, Brown has a gift for the theatrical. In an interview at
the governor's mansion in Sacramento, he wonders why everyone is not
paying attention to his new friend and his warnings for mankind. "He is
at the brink! At the brink! Not WAS at the brink---IS at the brink,"
Brown exclaimed. "But no one else is." A California governor can have
more influence, at least indirectly, than one might think, due to the
state's outsized role in policy debates and the fact that the University
of California's Board of Regents helps manage some of the nation's top
weapons laboratories, which study and design nuclear weapons. Brown, who
was a vocal critic in the 1980s of what he called America\'s \"nuclear
addiction,\" reviewed Perry\'s recent memoir in the New York Review of
Books, and said he is determined to help his new friend spread his
message. "Everybody is, \'we are not at the brink,\' and we have this
guy Perry who says we are. It is the thesis that is being ignored.\"
Even if more influential people wake up to Perry's message---a nuclear
event is more likely and will be more terrible than you realize---a hard
questions remains: Now what? This is where Perry's pragmatism comes back
into play. The smartest move, he thinks, is to eliminate the riskiest
part of the system. If we can't eliminate all nukes, Perry argues, we
could at least eliminate one leg of the so-called nuclear triad,
intercontinental ballistic missiles. These are especially prone to an
accidental nuclear war, if they are launched by accident or due to
miscalculation by a leader operating with only minutes to spare. Nuclear
weapons carried by submarines beneath the sea or aboard bomber planes,
he argues, are logically more than enough to deter Russia. The problem,
he knows, is that logic is not necessarily the prevailing force in
political debates. Psychology is, and this seems to be dictating not
merely that we deter a Russian military force that is modernizing its
weapons but that we have a force that is self-evidently superior to
them. It is an argument that strikes Perry as drearily familiar to the
old days. Which leads him the conclusion that [the only long-term way
out is to persuade a younger generation to make a different
choice]{.underline}. His granddaughter, Lisa Perry, is precisely in the
cohort he needs to reach. At first she had some uncomfortable news for
her grandfather: [Not many]{.underline} in her generation [thought much
about the issue]{.underline}. "[The more I learned from him about
nuclear weapons the more concerned I was that my generation had this
massive and dangerous blind spot in our understanding of the world," she
said in an interview. "Nuclear weapons are the biggest public health
issue I can think of]{.underline}." But she has not lost hope that their
efforts can make a difference, and today she has put her graduate
studies in public health on hold to work full time for the Perry Project
as its social media and web manager. "[It can be easy to get discouraged
about being able to do anything to change our course," she said. "But
the good news is that nuclear weapons are actually something that we as
humans can control\...but first we need to start the
conversation.]{.underline}" It was with her help that Perry went on
Reddit to field questions ranging from how his PhD in mathematics
prepared him to what young people need to understand. "As a 90s baby I
never lived in the Cold War era," wrote one participant, with the Reddit
username BobinForApples. "What is one thing today\'s generations will
never understand about life during the Cold War?" Perry's answered, as
SecDef19: "Because you were [born in the 1990s]{.underline}, you did not
experience the daily terror of 'duck and cover' drills as my children
did. Therefore [the appropriate fear of nuclear weapons is not part of
your heritage, but the danger is just as real now as it was then. It
will be up to your generation to develop the policies to deal with the
deadly nuclear legacy that is still very much with us.]{.underline}" For
the former defense secretary, the task now is to
finally---belatedly---prove Einstein wrong. The physicist said in 1946:
"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes
of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe." In
Perry's view **[the only way to avoid it is by directly contemplating
catastrophe]{.underline}**---and doing so face to face with the world's
largest nuclear power, Russia, as he recently did in a forum in
Luxembourg with several like-minded Russians he says are brave enough to
speak out about nuclear dangers in the era of Putin. "[We could solve
it," he said. "When you're a prophet of doom, what keeps you going is
not just prophesizing doom but saying there are things we do to avoid
that doom. That's where the optimism is."]{.underline}

### Perm

#### Permutation do both - Pragmatism centered on weak-ontological claims is the best process for political contestation 

**Nyman**, Teaching Fellow in International Relations at the University
of Leicester, UK, **'16**

(Jonna, "Pragmatism, practice and the value of security," in *Ethical
Security Studies: A new research agenda*, Routledge, pg. 139-141)

[A **pragmatic**, **practice-centred** approach can help us return to
the original forces of critical security studies:]{.underline} the
politics of security and life experiences of it. [Existing approaches
remain split]{.underline} over the value of security and the meaning or
purpose of 'critical'/'Critical' research. [Many reject the possibility
for security to be ethically good, **suggesting that it is too 'tainted'
by its association with existing problematic national security
practices**]{.underline} **[and ontologies]{.underline}**. [Alongside
this]{.underline} a concern with power has led [poststructuralist
authors]{.underline} to [focus on deconstruction over
reconstruction]{.underline}, in return for which they are critiqued for
lacking 'emancipatory impetus' (Hnyek and Chandler 2013). However,
pragmatism can help us recognise core concerns and help us move forward
through three contributions. First, it avoids foundational \'truth';
second it presents a different way to think about ethics though a \'weak
foundationalism\' allowing for contingent ethical claims; and third, it
allows us to move forward with a practical research agenda. The rest of
this chapter will expand on these contributions. **[A pragmatic approach
rejects the idea of foundational \'truth\',]{.underline}** **[and
involves a recognition that nothing is ever definitively
settled.]{.underline}** **[Rather than being
anti-foundationalist]{.underline}**, Cochran suggests, **[a pragmatic
approach can be seen as \'weak foundationalist\']{.underline}**, **[and
leads to contingent ethical claims which are context-dependent,
temporary and provisional\']{.underline}** (Cochran 1999: 16). Based on
this, [Cochran]{.underline} has [used pragmatism to build bridges in
normative theorising within IR]{.underline}. She argues that for
pragmatists, **[establishing \'truth\' is not the same as for a
positivist]{.underline}**: [it involves settling a controversial or
complex issue **for the time being**,]{.underline} [until something
comes along to dislodge the comfort and reassurance that has thereby
been achieved]{.underline}, **[forcing inquiry to begin
again\']{.underline}** (Cochran 2002: 527, 1999). So, while progress is
always provisional, \'it is not empty\' (Cochran 2002: 528). [Such a
\'weak foundationalist\' approach helps us to move beyond debates
over]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} or not **[security is
\'positive\* or \'negative\',]{.underline}** **[as nothing is ever
definitively settled]{.underline}**. Though she doesn\'t use the
terminology of pragmatism, Mustapha makes a similar argument in
proposing a \'modified' poststructuralist approach to security based on
weak foundationalism. As with an \'unsettled\' pragmatic approach, this
means that **[\'any ontological claims that are made must always be open
to interrogation\']{.underline}** (Mustapha 2013: 74-5). [This allows us
to engage with the]{.underline} **[(contingent)
\"realities\"]{.underline}** [of actual \"security\"
problems\']{.underline} (Mustapha 2013: 77), a**[nd makes reconstruction
possible even for most poststructuralists.]{.underline}** Here,
\'[(contingent) foundational claims are not static and are open to
interrogation]{.underline}, **[but are necessary for politics and
ethics]{.underline}**. Security is a practice/means as well as an end'
(Mustapha 2013: 82). The weak foundationalism which underpins pragmatism
emphasises the contingent nature of claims, and shows that security
doesn\'t have to always be negative - but likewise, [any \'ethical\' or
\'positive\' notion of security should not be considered to be **fixed**
or permanent]{.underline}. Instead, **[reflexivity is
imperative]{.underline}**, [**with continuous evaluation and
re-evaluation of our claims**. It also helps us to move past
arguments]{.underline} by poststructuralist and Copenhagen School
authors who suggest [that]{.underline} the way in which security has
traditionally been attached to problematic national security politics
**[means it is \'tainted by association.]{.underline}** [Instead, the
meaning and value of security is not fixed]{.underline} and can change,
**[and will never be settled]{.underline}**. **[It also helps to avoid
some of the controversial baggage of emancipatory
approaches]{.underline}** (Barkawi and Laffey 2006: 350). [It also helps
us to move beyond debates over
deconstruction]{.underline}/reconstruction [and the meaning and purpose
of critique]{.underline} - most importantly [because it is **inherently
pluralist**,]{.underline} [and therefore argues that there is no one
\'truth']{.underline} **[and so no correct approach to critique or
ethics]{.underline}**. P[oststructuralist discomfort with going beyond
critique]{.underline} and related concerns with power **[become less
significant once we recognise this]{.underline}**. Anti-foundauonalists
don\'t believe that there are secure foundations on which we can base
ethics[: a pragmatic approach helps us to recognise]{.underline} [the
lack of secure foundations and still move forward with reconstructive
agendas]{.underline}. Ultimately, **[it allows for suggestions of
alternatives based on experiences]{.underline}**, **[while recognising
that these alternatives will never be final]{.underline}**.
Consequently, [although we can never reach emancipation\' or
\'security\']{.underline}, **[we can instead focus on becoming more
secure, given what we know about different conditions and contexts at
any given time.]{.underline}** This moves us onto the second
contribution a pragmatist approach can make: [it provides us with a
different way to think about ethics]{.underline}. As noted, Cochran
makes a link between a pragmatic weak foundationalism and contingent
ethical claims. [Once we reject \'truth\', it becomes clear that ethical
claims, or the 'good', can never be settled]{.underline} **[but must
rather be continually re-thought and unproved upon]{.underline}**. Thus,
[while we can draw ethical conclusions]{.underline}, **[these
conclusions are \'no more than temporary resting places for ethical
critique\']{.underline}** (Cochran 1999: 17). Drawing on Brassett\'s
work on pragmatism, **[we can suggest \'possibilities, while remaining
sensitive to their limitations\']{.underline}** (Brassett 2009a: 226).
Once we drop the obsession with \'truth\' and finding \'truth\' in
scholarly enquiry, [the task becomes one of engaging in the **trial and
error process**]{.underline} [of suggesting possibilities\']{.underline}
(Brassett 2009a: 226). Drawing on Rorty, he argues that \'ethics is
political - negotiated is a relational human construct - and politics is
ethical: a process of contest that has direct ethical outcomes\';
therefore, recognising that there is no foundation \'does not mean
dropping values, or the notion of progress\' (Brassett 2009b: 282). This
helps us move past debates over the value of security by showing that it
depends on the context. Thus, [both sides of the debate are right:
security can be problematic,]{.underline} [but it can also be
\'good\'.]{.underline} However, [any notion of positive or
good\']{.underline} security [**has to be continually interrogated**. It
also helps to reframe the debate over
deconstruction/reconstruction]{.underline} by **[shifting it in favour
of moving forward towards \'better\' things rather than establishing
abstract \'positive\' alternatives]{.underline}**. In the process, it
emphasises the fact that all alternatives have limitations. [The focus
on experience]{.underline}. [including alternative experiences, is
central to pragmatism\'s contribution to debates over security
ethics]{.underline}. Brassett makes a related argument drawing on Rortv.
presenting a different view of ethics as grounded in experiences: [we
need to **overcome** the second view]{.underline} [that effective
resistance requires us to somehow **\'distance\'** ourselves from power.
This view that we can somehow practice critique from a standpoint that
transcends questions of power and domination in]{.underline} **[Truth,
the ideal speech situation, or some other idea(l) suggests that there
are correct \'spaces\' or \'practices\' of resistance]{.underline}**, be
it democracy, [the revolutionary working class or a post-national
constellation.]{.underline} (Brassett 2009a: 242)

### Alt fails

#### The alt causes more violence

**Condit 15** \[Celeste, Distinguished Research Professor of
Communication Studies at the University of Georgia, "Multi-Layered
Trajectories for Academic Contributions to Social Change," Feb 4, 2015,

Thus, [when Žižek]{.underline} and others [urge us to "Act"]{.underline}
with violence to destroy the current Reality, **[without a vision of an
alternative]{.underline}**, on the grounds that the links between
actions and consequences are never certain, [we can call his appeal both
a **failure of imagination** and a **failure of reality**]{.underline}.
As for reality, [we have dozens of revolutions as models, and the
historical record indicates quite clearly that they generally lead not
to harmonious cooperation]{.underline} (what I call "AnarchoNiceness" to
gently mock the romanticism of Hardt and Negri) [but instead to the
production of **totalitarian states**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}/or
**[violent factional strife.]{.underline}** A materialist constructivist
epistemology accounts for this by predicting that it is not possible for
symbol-using animals to exist in a symbolic void. [All symbolic movement
has a trajectory, and if you have not **imagined a potentially
realizable alternative** for that trajectory to take, then what people
will **leap into** is biological predispositions]{.underline}---t[he
first iteration of which is the rule of the strongest]{.underline}
primate. Indeed[, **this is what experience with revolutions** has shown
to be the most probable outcome of a revolution that is **merely against
an Evil**.]{.underline} [The failure of imagination]{.underline} in such
rhetorics thereby [reveals itself to be critical]{.underline}, so it is
worth pondering sources of that failure. The rhetoric of "the kill" in
social theory in the past half century has repeatedly reduced to the
leap into a void because the symbolized alternative that the context of
the twentieth century otherwise predispositionally offers is to the
binary opposite of capitalism, i.e., communism. That rhetorical option,
however, has been foreclosed by the historical discrediting of the
readily imagined forms of communism (e.g., Žižek9). [The hard work to
invent better alternatives is not as dramatically enticing as the story
of the kill: such labor is **piecemeal**]{.underline}, **[intellectually
difficult]{.underline}**, [requires multi-disciplinary understandings,
and]{.underline} perhaps [requires **more creativity**]{.underline}
[than the **typical academic theorist** can muster]{.underline}. [In the
absence of a viable alternative]{.underline}, the [appeals to Radical
Revolution seem to have been]{.underline} [sustained by the emotional
zing of the kill]{.underline}, in many cases amped up by the appeal of
autonomy and manliness (Žižek uses the former term and deploys the ethos
of the latter). But [if one does not provide a **viable
vision**]{.underline} that offers a reasonable chance of leaving most
people better off than they are now, [then **Fox News has a better
offering**]{.underline} (you\'ll be free and you\'ll get rich!). [A
revolution posited as a void cannot succeed as a horizon of
history]{.underline}, [other than as constant local scale violent
actions]{.underline}, perhaps connected by shifting networks we call
"terrorists." This analysis of the geo-political situation, of the
onto-epistemological character of language, and of the limitations of
the dominant horizon of social change indicates that [the **focal
project**]{.underline} [for progressive Left Academics
should]{.underline} now [include the **hard labor**]{.underline} [to
produce alternative visions that appear materially
feasible.]{.underline}

# K\-\--Security

### Dillon 

#### Securitization generates [spectacular threats]{.underline} to [deflect attention]{.underline} from everyday repression and secure [servitude]{.underline} to governmentality --- impact's [extinction]{.underline} and [value to life]{.underline}.

**Dillon '15** --- Michael Dillon; Emeritus Professor of Politics @
Lancaster University. (4-21-2015; "Biopolitics of Security: A Political
Analytic of Finitude;" Published by *Routledge*; pg. 209-212; //GrRv)

The societies of the North Atlantic basin have never been so secure.
That security is a function of such a Wide variety of [[security
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} and practices it seem pointless to
name them, for they [[**penetrate** into]{.mark} the very **weft** and
**warp** of **[everyday life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Pointless to name
them, but not pointless to re-describe them by giving them a different
name. They are in every respect baroque. Ordinarily addressed as a
period and or a style of art, an aesthetic, the bauoque names, instead,
a space of problematisation, and a mode of operationalisation. If fac-
tical finitude is the condition of possibility for the baroque, as well
as for modern politics, the baroque names factical finitude's condition
of operability. No more so, in fact, than in respect of the conditions
of operability of modern politics of security. What is being secured, in
the securing of Life whose very vital signs are now construed as
generically dangerous to itself, or of the sovereign that is fated to
fail the standards of sovereign being, is the continuous suspension of
any other expression of politics. It is a
**[[suppression]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[works
through]{.underline}]{.mark} substitution, [the **substitution** of
[repeated **clichés**,]{.mark} **marvels** [and **spectacles**
concerning]{.mark} the \'now\', the \'future\' , \'potency\' , \'radical
contingency\' and [**survivability** in a world whose **very security
apparatuses** have]{.mark} turned **politically motivated
[killing]{.mark}** [into an **industrial**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
commercial [**[processes]{.mark}** **integral to our civilization** but
[capable]{.mark} also [of threatening the **survivability** of
**planetary life**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the beginning of the
twenty-first century, [[these now seek]{.mark} their [expression in
**tropes**]{.mark} that **intensify** security's **baroque fixation**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} morbidity,
**[[mortality]{.underline}]{.mark}** and modernity: complex adaptation
and change, [**[competitiveness]{.mark}**, **emergence**, **catastrophic
[emergency]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the event that saves, the event that
threatens, [and]{.underline}, above all, [**resilience** the capacity to
endure]{.underline} by becoming something else. To survive is to submit,
through holocaust or social therapy, to self-annihilation as
governmental necessity. We might therefore envisage the baroque
character of [[our **politics of security** as the attempt to **unify
these themes** within **synthetic narratives** of
**competitiveness**]{.mark}, **identity**]{.underline}, [[**the enemy**,
or]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[**terror**.]{.mark} The past of
**security** and [**war** is forgotten by **continuous repetition** in
**spectacle**,]{.mark} **simulation** and **practice**]{.underline}.
These are now organised through scopic regimes employmg different orders
of signification and representation as well as novel technologies. To
give our contemporary politics of security another name is, therefore, a
deliberate device. It gives them another face. In rhetoric this
manoeuvre is called prosopopoeia. Strictly speaking, prosopopoeia gives
a face to that which does not have a face. Our security politics are
preoccupied, however, with presenting a face that will move the world, a
face for the world to accept at face value. Having a face is, therefore,
not the issue here. The issue is what face. I have attempted to give our
politics of security another face, one capable of refracting its face of
baroque display. Prosopopoeia is a difficult art. It does not seek to
achieve closure or finality as some forms of narrative, history and
positivity do. It does not labour under the rule of verisimilar
adequacy, and it does not suborn itself to policy or governmental
relevance. It seeks to represent not that which is absent, \'but that
whose presence is so intense that we can only feel it and see it from a
safe distance\' (Godzich and Spadaccini, in Maravall 1986: xiil---xiv).
Initially, the political programme of the baroque was the formal answer
of the monarchical-seigniorial segments of sixteenth-century Spanish
society, to the assaults launched against the traditional étatist
structure taking shape in early modern Spain (Godzich and Spadaccini, in
Maravall 1986: xvii). One of its most distinguished historians, José
Antonio Maravall, defines the baroque, \'as a culture provoked by a
cultural crisis of major proportions, one that was felt in all of
Europe, and perhaps most intensely in Spain, during the greater part of
the seventeenth century\' (Godzich and Spadaccini, in Maravall 1986:
xviii). Where, once, baroque politics included defence of the monarchy,
the safeguard of honour as the raison d\'état of individual and social
life, and the constant reaffirmation of love as a universal
justification (Godzich and Spadaccini, in Maravall 1986: xix), [our
**baroque politics of [security]{.mark}** [is **a** ]{.mark}**vast
[palimpsest]{.mark}** of **rules of truth** and **truths of rule**,
**constantly** [reaffirming **peace**]{.mark}**, rights and justice**
[as]{.mark} **universal [justifications]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
**security and [war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The baroque names its mode
of operativity, rather than a period. I have extended this description
of it to the generic crisis induced by factical finitude and the
changing baroque politics of security that helps distinguish the states
and societies of the North Atlantic basin at the beginning of the
twenty-first century. As with the early baroque, so also with the
twenty-first century we are confronted with a political culture directed
towards the multitude of anonymous and, therefore, potentially
disruptive individuals --- homegrown \'terrorists\', for example --- no
longer simply concentrated in the cities, but capable of circulating
globally. [Its **mode of operativity** is **distinguished** by the
effort that is spent on **casting the political subject**
as]{.underline} political **[spectator]{.underline}**, [whose
**voluntary servitude** to **indefinite governance** is **secured**
through the **spectacles of security**, **catastrophic emergency and
war**, as much as through their everyday
governmentalisation]{.underline}. Deleuze noted, acutely, that, \' ltlhe
essence of the baroque entails neither falling Into nor emerging from
illusion but rather realizing something in illusion itself\' (Deleuze
1992: 124). A fuller depiction of the neo-baroque character of
contemporary security politics, therefore, requires further studies.
Among other things, these would have to revisit the problematization not
only of spectacle and the virtual, but all modes of making manifest
politically and governmentally in which these are Intimately involved as
a matter of priority. But this has to wait, and for the moment I can
only add a coda to the present book, by gesturing towards how politics
of security in the twenty-first century are distinguished by the ways in
which they exceed the katechontic security politics of the baroque
sovereign that I introduced, thlough Reinhart Koselleck and Carl
Schmitt, in the first chapter of the book. Politics of security remain
katechontic, fated to pursue the infinite deferral of the very finitude
of which they are comprised, and from which they also take their warrant
to conduct the infinite securitisation of finite things and processes of
becoming finite. But this katechontic enterprise changes its character
as we not only move from addressing modern sovereign geopolitics to
biopolitics, but also as we move from the baroque traits of the early
modern era to those of the neo--- baroque of our own times. What is
additionally interesting is that, as [the modern geopolitics of the West
has become a largely biopolitical enterprise, so also has the
katechontic task of restraint become acceleration of the very forces
that the katechon was once said to restrain --- chaos, lawlessness and
anarchy, since order now is commonly said to arise from
chaos.]{.underline} Katechontic politics of security at the beginning of
the twenty-first century thus aim to become the very anomic chaos
originally stigmatised in the anarchy problematic of classical
international relations theory, which so extolled the necessity of the
sovereign state, and of statecraft, simultaneously also fostering the
belief that there was no stagecraft to statecraft, in explicitly
katechontic terms. No longer simply committed to restraining the coming
of the end, [the katechontic enterprise of the biopolitics of security
of the twenty-first century is now much less committed to restraint than
to **acceleration**]{.underline}, acceleration of the vital forces of
being-information and becoming---dangerous that exceed finitude, thereby
offering the prospect of securely commanding it.

### Leese

#### Vote NEG to reject security logic [in the making]{.underline}. 

**Leese '15** --- Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, International
Centre for Ethics in the Sciences and Humanities (IZEW), Research
Associate (Matthias, "On Security, Once More: Assorted Inquiries in
Aviation", Universität Tübingen: Dissertation, dml)

Thus, [how are we to come to terms with an agenda of security as
assemblage]{.underline} empirically, if its empirics are defined by
radical openness? Connolly (2013: 401) [suggests a clear-cut "problem
orientation, pursuing the contours of an issue up and down these
interacting scales]{.underline}, as the issue requires." [[If security
politics evolve around **specific**]{.mark} **security
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in whichever of the manifold ways that
we have sketched out so far, [[then the]{.mark} very [evolution
of]{.mark} complex]{.underline}, and at times contradictory,
[[assemblages]{.mark} alongside the constitution of security politics
[provides a **valuable starting point**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Adey
and Anderson (2012: 106) argue, "[in seeking to understand how life is
governed in and through contingency, we should take care to remember the
contingencies of the apparatus of security]{.underline} -- that is, [how
apparatuses form, endure and change as the elements that compose them
are (re)deployed.]{.underline}" [Already implied in such a perspective
is the notion that [each]{.mark} assemblage [could be formed
differently]{.mark} -- [and]{.mark} that [what we encounter is]{.mark}
merely [a]{.mark} momentary [snap-shot]{.mark} of stabilization [that
might]{.mark}]{.underline} rather sooner than later [**[fall
apart]{.mark} again** [through]{.mark} the multiple [contestations
t]{.mark}hat security is subjected to]{.underline}. As Schouten (2014b:
88) claims, such a perspective could considerably contribute to a
general agenda of thinking about security by "by radicalizing the
insight in security studies that security is 'essentially contested' to
study the on-going attempts to stabilize security." As he adds: "if
security practitioners 'out there' struggle with the very ontology of
(in)security, how could 'we' as analysts a priori decide that security
is a matter of discourse, practice or materiality?" (Schouten, 2014b:
88) The utility of such an approach becomes rather obvious when we call
to mind the preceding narrative of security as economy and the ensuing
"close assemblage with international partners and private companies that
underpin the EU's force in the domain of security" (de Goede, 2011: 12).
Moreover, it can also contribute to the multiple layers of security as
surveillance and technology, as government, and as futurity and
securitization. [Security as assemblage]{.underline}, however, [is not
some kind of 'master narrative']{.underline}. Neither does it occupy a
privileged position among the narratives of security provided here.
Rather, [thinking about security as assemblage can]{.underline} arguably
[contribute to a better understanding of how all of those narratives
come into being empirically -- not necessarily through an underlying
political agenda, but through complexity, fragility, and
ambiguity]{.underline}. With regard to security, then, as Schouten
(2014a: 28) explains, "this process of translation concerns ontological
politics, for establishing security as technical rather than social, or
private rather than public, subsequently restricts and redefines
accountability; distribution of scarce output; and/or the scope of
possible action available to different affected actors \[emph. in
orig.\]." After all, as Rose (1999: 22) reminds us, "[the space of
government is always shaped and intersected by other
discourses]{.underline}, notably the veridical discourses of science and
changing moral rhetorics and ethical vocabularies, [which have their own
histories, apparatuses and problem spaces, and whose relation to
problematics of government is not expression or causation but
translation]{.underline}." [It is this]{.underline} very [translation
that must be researched empirically if any analysis seeks to unpack
specific security assemblages. The processes of translation **mark the
trajectories** along which actor relations form and re-form,
and]{.underline}, most importantly, [become visible: "**[when security
is in the making]{.mark}** -- that is, still a controversy to be settled
-- [it is ontologically unstable]{.mark} and **indistinguishable from
the 'context'** made up of economic, technological]{.underline}, medical
[and legal considerations]{.underline}" (Schouten, 2014a: 38). Scholars
of governmentality have shown that "[an analytics of a particular regime
of practices]{.underline}, at a minimum, [seeks to identify the
emergence of that regime, examine the multiple sources of the elements
that constitute it, and follow the diverse processes and relations by
which these elements are assembled into relatively stable forms of
organization and institutional practice]{.underline}" (Dean, 2006: 21),
and thus we can once more identify a strong parallel here. As Rose
(1999: 277) quite plainly frames the issue, "our present has arisen as
much from the logics of contestation as from any imperatives of
control", and thus security studies must in fact transcend the scope on
control that strikes at the heart of many inquiries into surveillance
and technology. In the vein of Foucauldian thought, as Schouten (2014a:
38) emphasizes, [the ["critical purchase]{.mark}]{.underline} thus
[[lies in]{.mark} offering us [a way to study security,]{.mark} not in
terms of stable arrangements that impress themselves upon us as powerful
'cold monsters', but rather [as unsettled accounts]{.mark} of fragile
security by **entering in to the controversies [when security is still
in the making]{.mark}**]{.underline}." What implications must be derived
from such insight? How does [this narrative]{.underline} of security as
assemblage undermine, underpin, challenge, or reinforce its preceding
narratives? It most certainly [thwarts any over-simplistic understanding
of security that centers merely centers around selected
rationalities]{.underline}, [thereby neglecting others]{.underline}.
[[It can]{.underline}]{.mark} serve to [[highlight]{.underline}
[how]{.underline}]{.mark} economics or technological [discourses have
prevailed]{.underline} in the arena [by tracing how, and through which
particular [power relations]{.mark}, controversies and ambiguities have
[become]{.mark} settled and [stabilized]{.mark}. [And]{.mark} by doing
so, it can]{.underline} most notably [**challenge security politics** by
[expos]{.mark}ing reductionist and [**epistemologically twisted
arguments**]{.mark} of governing, of securitization, and of
futurity]{.underline}. As Connolly (2013: 404) rather ironically puts
the added value of assemblage thought: "'How come we did not anticipate
this?', ask the Intelligence agencies. '[How come we did not predict
this?', whisper [political scientists]{.mark} to each other, before they
catch themselves to recall how they [only promise to predict]{.mark}
hypothetical [events]{.mark} under conditions in which the 'variables'
are]{.underline} closely [specified, [and not to explain actual events
in the messy]{.mark}, ongoing [actualities of]{.mark} triggering forces,
contagious actions, [complex]{.mark} and floating conflicts, creative
[responses]{.mark}, obscure searches, ambiguous anxieties, and shifting
hopes]{.underline}."

[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} interpretation and [[**empowerment** of the
societies that experienced **domination**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Postcolonialism became popular in the mid 1980's , and from the very
beginning it was positioned as a research perspective in between
humanistic and social science, and it is quite difficult to draw a
border between postcolonialism and social constructivism. I am arguing
that postcolonialism can be defined as a part of the social
constructivist paradigm. Even though, hybridization of theoretical
approaches in IR became an immanent feature of the discipline,
[[Postcolonialism can]{.mark}]{.underline} be
[[hardly]{.underline}]{.mark} **['[adjust]{.mark}']{.underline}** [[to
**classical realism**, which is **obsessed with
the**]{.mark}]{.underline} focus on [**[state]{.mark}**]{.underline} as
a major subject or actor [in the **anarchical international
environment**, [where states are **constantly bound**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[prisoner's
dilemmas]{.underline}]{.mark}** situations, [and are forced to define
its interests in]{.underline} the **[categories of power]{.underline}**.
[[Postcolonialism **challenges this narration**]{.mark} by admitting
that [the perception of **developed** and **postcolonial states** as a
**single** research category **starkly reduces** the]{.mark} scholars
[ability to observe]{.mark} the **[differences in political
processes]{.mark}** that are of **crucial meaning** for the character
and form of particular international interactions]{.underline}. The
meanings, perceptions, collective understandings and intersubjective
knowledge remain major categories for postcolonial authors, who follow
the path paved by the Edward Said in "Orientalism" , where he connected
ideas about Western imaginations (often based on prejudices and
stereotypes) and constructions of the East with Gramscian understanding
of hegemony, and Foucault's notions about relations between power and
knowledge.

#### Realism is wrong and reinforces violence

Relations at Sussex University, UK, and co-Director of the media company

Writing about international relations from a poststructuralist
perspective, Ashley's arguments build upon Foucault's analysis of the
constitution and problematization of subjectivities. Yet Ashley adds
Jacques Derrida's deconstructive critique of logocentrism to this
analysis, based upon his reading of Derrida's texts from the 1970s and
1980s (e.g., 1977; 1981).

[Logocentrism refers to how 'the word'---indeed, a singular, specific
word signifying a specific presence---grounds all meaning in a
linguistic system because of how it is positioned as a universal
referent that is located outside of history]{.underline}. In the
classical age, 'God' was the most common example of a 'Logos' in a
logocentric system. In the modern age, as Nietzsche argued, 'man'
displaced 'God' from this logocentric position. Understood as 'a pure
and originary presence---an unproblematic, extrahistorical identity, in
need of no critical accounting' (Ashley 1989, 261), ['**modern man**' is
now the figure who functions in **modern discourse** as 'an **origin**,
an **identical voice** that is regarded as the **sovereign source** of
**truth** and **meaning'**]{.underline} (Ashley 1989, 261).

Derrida argues that by identifying one word, one being, one presence as
an originary 'logos' from which all other meanings flow, [**logocentric
systems** create **conditions of possibility** for both **hierarchies**
in linguistic systems and specific **narratives of**
**history**]{.underline}. [Applying Derrida's ideas]{.underline} to
modern renderings of international politics and international theory
(especially [to]{.underline} Kenneth **[Waltz's neorealist
theory]{.underline}**),10 Ashley [explains how 'the Logos' is the
'**sovereign source** of **truth** and **meaning'**]{.underline} in the
manifestation and analysis of the modern nation-state and in specific
renderings of domestic and international orders.

Specifically, Ashley argues that in international relations theory and
practice, '[modern man]{.underline}' [as **sovereign man** functions not
only as 'the Logos' of modernity in general but also as the **foundation
of the sovereign nation-state.**]{.underline} This is because, since the
move from monarchical to popular sovereignty, it has been 'modern man'
who has given the modern nation-state its sovereign authority. [The
state's **sovereign authority**]{.underline} that had previously been
vested in the monarch---as transcendental, as reasonable, as the
interpreter of meaning[---is now vested instead in '**modern
man**']{.underline}. To be sovereign, then, every sovereign nation-state
inscribes a particular sovereign man as an always already existing
domestic presence, as the foundation of its authority domestically and
internationally, which emerges from the complex interplay of domestic
and international relations.11

Now [[**hope** is]{.mark} an orientation [toward]{.mark} this
**[participation in change]{.mark}**, this **participation as
change**]{.underline}. [This is the hope policy [rolls like **tear gas
into the undercommons**. Policy not only tries to **impose** this hope,
but]{.mark} also **[enacts it.]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[Those
who dwell in policy do so not just by invoking contingency but by
**riding it,**]{.underline} and so, in a sense, proving it. Those who
dwell in policy are prepared. They are legible to change, liable to
change, lendable to change. [Policy is not so much a position as a
disposition, a disposition toward display. This is why **policy's chief
manifestation** is **governance**.]{.underline}

[**[Governance]{.mark}** should not be confused with]{.underline}
government or [**governmentality**. Governance [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
most [importantly [a **new form of expropriation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is the provocation of a certain kind of display, a display of
interests as disinterestedness, a display of convertibility, a display
of legibility. [[Governance is an **instrumentalization of
policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a set of protocols of deputisation, where
one simultaneously auctions and bids on oneself, [[where the
public]{.underline}]{.mark} and the private [[**submit themselves** to
**post-fordist production**.]{.mark} **Governance**]{.underline} is the
harvesting of the means of social reproduction but it
[appears]{.underline} as the acts of will, and therefore [as the **death
drive, of the harvested**]{.underline}. As capital cannot know directly
the affect, thought, sociality, and imagination that make up the
undercommon means of social reproduction, it must instead prospect for
these in order to extract and abstract them as labor. That prospecting,
which is the real bio-prospecting, seeks to break an integrity that has
been militantly preserved. Governance, the voluntary but dissociative
offering up of interests, willing participation in the general privacy
and public privation, grants capital this knowledge, this wealth-making
capacity. Policy emits this offering, violently manifest as a moral
provocation. [The ones who would correct and the ones who would be
corrected converge around [this **imperative of submission**]{.mark}
that [is played out]{.mark} constantly not only [in]{.mark} that **range
of correctional facilities**]{.underline} that Foucault analysed --- the
[**[prisons]{.mark}**, the **hospitals**, the **[asylums]{.mark}** ---
but also in **[corporations, universities]{.mark}** and
**NGOs**]{.underline}. [That convergence is given not only
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[structures]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
affects [[of **endless war** but also in the **brutal
processes**]{.mark} and **perpetual processing [of
peace.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Governance]{.underline}, despite its own hopes for a universality of
exclusion, [is for the **inducted**]{.underline}, [for those who know
how to articulate interests **disinterestedly**, those who **vote** and
know **why they vote**]{.underline} (not because someone is black or
female but because he or she is smart), who have opinions and want to be
taken seriously by serious people. In the mean time, policy must still
pursue the quotidian sphere of open secret plans. [Policy posits
**curriculum against study**, **child development** against **play**,
**human capital against work**]{.underline}. It posits having a voice
against hearing voices, networked friending against contactual
friendship. [Policy posits the **public sphere**]{.underline}, or the
counter-public sphere, or the black public sphere, [against the
**illegal occupation** of the **illegitimately
privatized**]{.underline}. Policy is not the one against the many, the
cynical against the romantic, or the pragmatic against the principled.
[It is simply **baseless vision**, **woven into settler's
fabric**]{.underline}. [It is against **all conservation**, **all
rest,**]{.underline} [all **gathering**]{.underline}, cooking, drinking
and smoking [if they lead to **marronage**]{.underline}. [[Policy's
vision is to **break it up** then **fix it**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
move it along by fixing it, [[**manufacture ambition**]{.mark} and
**give it to your children**]{.underline}. [[Policy's hope is that there
will be **more policy, more participation, more
change**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [there is also a **danger** in all
this participation, a **danger of crisis.**]{.underline}

When [those who plan together start to participate without first being
**fixed**, [this leads to **crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Participation
without fully entering the blinding light of this dim enlightenment,
without fully functioning families and financial responsibility, without
respect for the rule of law, without distance and irony, without
submission to the rule of expertise; participation that is too loud, too
fat, too loving, too full, too flowing, too dread; this leads to crisis.
**[People are in crisis. Economies are in crisis]{.underline}**. [We are
facing an **unprecedented crisis**, a crisis of **participation**, a
crisis of **faith**]{.underline}. [Is there **any hope?**
**Yes**]{.underline}, there is, say the deputies, if we can pull
together, [if we can **share a vision of change**.]{.underline} [For
policy, any crisis in the productivity of radical contingency is a
**crisis in participation**]{.underline}, which is to say, [a crisis
provoked by the **wrong participation** of **the
wrong(ed).**]{.underline} This is the third rule of policy.

[The [crisis of the **credit crunch**]{.mark} caused by **sub-prime
debtors**]{.underline}, the crisis of race in the 2008 US elections
produced by Reverend Wright and Bernie Mac, [the crisis [in the **Middle
East**]{.mark}]{.underline} produced by Hamas, the crisis of obesity
produced by unhealthy eaters, [[the crisis of the
**environment**]{.underline}]{.mark} produced by Chinese and Indians,
[[are all instances of **incorrect**]{.mark} and **uncorrected
[participation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The constant materialisation of
planning in such participation is simply the **inevitability of
crisis**]{.mark},]{.underline} according to the deputised, [[who
prescribe]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a corrective, hope for and
**[[hopefulness in correction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They say that
participation must be hopeful, must have vision, must embrace change;
that participants must be fashioned, in a general imposition of
self-fashioning, as hopeful, visionary, change agents. Celebrating their
freedom on lockdown in the enterprise zone, guarding that held
contingency where the fashioning and correction of selves and others is
always on automatic, the participant is the deputy's mirror image.

[Deputies]{.underline} will lead the way toward concrete changes in the
face of crisis. Be smart, they say. Believe in change. This is what we
have been waiting for. Stop criticising and offer solutions. Set up
roadblocks and offer workshops. Check ID's and give advice. Distinguish
between the desire to correct and the desire to plan with others.
[Ruthlessly **seek out** and **fearfully beware militant preservation**,
in an **undercommons** of **means without ends**, of love among
things]{.underline}. Now's the time to declare and, in so doing,
correctly fashion yourself as the one who is deputised to correct
others. Now's the time, before its night again. Before you start singing
another half-illiterate fantasy. Before you resound that ongoing
amplification of the bottom, the operations on the edge of normal
rhythm's soft center. [Before someone says let's get together and get
some land.]{.underline} [But **we're not smart**.]{.underline} **[We
plan]{.underline}**. We plan to stay, to stick and move. We plan to be
communist about communism, to be unreconstructed about reconstruction,
to be absolute about abolition, here, in that other, undercommon place,
as that other, undercommon thing, that we preserve by inhabiting.
[Policy **can't see it**, policy can't **read it,** but it's
**intelligible if you got a plan.**]{.underline}

and the Radical Reimagining of Old Worlds;" Published in *Futures of
Black Radicalism*; //GrRv)

The famed, British-trained, American political scientist Richard Rose
famously stated, "Analytically, the concept of ungovernability is a
nonsense."14 [**Rose** argued]{.underline} that, first, "the question is
not whether we shall be governed but how," second, "ungovernability can
only be a temporary phase of anarchy and of civil war,"15 and, third,
"for better or worse," being governed is a natural state, and being
[ungoverned is an **aberration** that needs to be
**corrected**]{.underline}. This [view naturalizes the idea of order and
**norms political authority** as **rational**. Governability is thus
**ontological**: we are the way we are governed, and being ungoverned is
**nonbeing**. **State evasion** and other forms of avoidance of being
governed are **deviant behavior** that **necessitates disciplining**,
from **reconditioning to total annihilation**]{.underline}.

Ideationally then, [the ungovernable has been conscripted as a
**problem-subject**, and one that **needs reform**]{.underline}.
Sociologists, for instance, often focus on problem-people and
communities, those who have been normed and scaled as the gendered
and/or racialized other. At one time or another, [indigenous people,
Arabs, Mexicans, Muslims, Africans, single women, and LBGTQ people have
been among the "**other**,"]{.underline} who have been [thought of as
**problem people** in **need of being governed,**]{.underline} [**tamed,
subdued**, and]{.underline}, in certain circumstances, **[annihilated
altogether]{.underline}**. It is presumed and argued that these
ungovernable cannot be reasoned with; they are evil and will only
understand the language of force.16 Similarly, certain spaces,
especially urban spaces, are seen as ungovernable. The West Side of
Phoenix, Harlem, Cabrini Green, Watts, Detroit, large swaths of the
Global South, and [the **entirety of the Third World** are **problem
peoples** and **spaces** because they are **ungovernable**, appearing
together as a an entire cosmology,]{.underline} a fearsome Black planet.
The poor, Black people of Ferguson, Chicago, East Los Angeles, and
Harlem---and anywhere there are ungovernable lives---are problem
subjects, especially in communities where Black lives matter. [The
**rational choice that follow** entails everything the **capacious
apparatuses** and **technologies of violence have to offer**, including
"**evacuation**," **mass incarceration**, **deportation**, tanks, guns,
tear gas, and **surveillance**]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the
killing of Michael Brown and the ensuing protests, [**Ferguson** became
an **ungovernable problem-space**]{.underline}, with the majority of its
people and even its police force deemed troublesome. Former attorney
general Eric Holder was regularly dispatched to troubled/ungovernable
regions, enforcing coherence on the progressively implausible imperial
narrative about American exceptionalism.17 [Then there is the
**frequent** and **increasingly amplified speechifying**]{.underline} by
the first Black president [in defense of **liberal democracies** and
their **attendant ideologies,** justifying the **perpetual wars** on the
**troublesome Middle East** or **South Asia** or **North
Africa.**]{.underline}

All the while, in political science, [ungovernability scandalously
continues to be dismissed as **analytical nonsense**.]{.underline} While
[the **framing** of the ungovernable is used, with **great frequency and
utility**, to **cast** and **organize people** and lands, to **justify
and wage permanent wars**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} even
[**genocide**, in political science]{.underline}---the field tasked with
helping us understand how we come by these policies---[its **mandarins
persist** in their views that ungovernability is **conceptually
nonsensical**.]{.underline} [This **scandalous intent**]{.underline}
suggests an ideography that [owes its]{.underline} pathos to and
[possessive investments on an **epistemological ordering** that relies
on **state addiction**. This affliction is a **pathology** that renders
its sufferers **entirely dependent on the state** for **sensibility**
and **intelligence**.]{.underline} The symptoms are many and obvious:
most prominent is the tendency to conflate government with governing,
authority with leadership, and rule with submission.18 [**State-centric
analytics** commit addicts to a certain notion of the state, even to the
extent of the state becoming the **very fiction that we
fear**]{.underline}.19

Take for instance the eminent architect of deconstructionism, Jacques
Derrida, who conflated sovereignty with transcendence. According to
Derrida, "sovereignty is in a certain manner un-historical, it is a
contract made with a history contracting itself into the punctiform
event of an exceptional decision without temporal and historical
expansion. Thus sovereignty also withdraws itself from language."20 So
it is: timeless and outside of history; moreover, there is, "no
sovereignty without violence, without the force of the stronger, the
justification of which---as the right of the strongest---consists in its
power over everything."21 The sovereign has power over everything,
including life itself. Rather than imagining the future in terms of
democractic living, sensibilities, and formations of justice, state
addicts leave us dependent on the state for means of expressions and
terms of engagement. Their imaginary domains22 are thus entirely
dependent on the state's projections. The state's memory becomes our own
memory. Just as Orlando Patterson's social death thesis fallaciously
endows racial capitalism and white supremacy as cultural progenitors of
Black life, so state analytics such as necropolitics23 render life sans
state, more often than not, chaotic, miserable and inauthentic.24 Within
the same frame of social death, as David Brion Davis has argued, Black
enslaved people have "no legitimate, independent being, no place in the
cosmos except as an instrument of \[their\] master's will."25 Similarly,
life sans state, as Hobbes declared in the Leviathan, is "evil, brutish
and short." Yet, empirically and intuitively, we know better. If rules
are not about norms but about discovering new forms of life, as Giorgio
Agamben argues in The Highest Poverty,26 then, in thinking about the
modern state and rule making, the ungovernable and ungovernability are
theoretical spaces that can help us think about life and the politics of
living wherein ordinary people and communities assert their own
renderings of life and living rather than those of the state, capital
and other dominions' terms of order. As suggested by the Ethiopian
proverb, it is prudent to recognize those instances when subversion
disguises itself as submission or obedience because those who are
oppressed cannot always exchange "a slap for a slap, an insult for an
insult," tear gas for tear gas.27 Just as sounds are not always heard
and fights are not always open, in the shadow of the real and fictive
narrations of governmentality and the awesome powers of the state, there
have always lurked individuals and communities embodying governing's
unsuccessful inscriptions and conscriptions. Individuals and communities
remain frequently unscripted and unimpressed by the state, even as they
live under constant surveillance and suppression. Life goes on,
sometimes independently, all the while circumscribed by the so-called
technologies of governing.28 In short, the analytical problem with
ungovernability is not about empirical verification, but about the
epistemological investments in political order and a modern ontological
commitment to governability.29 This commitment to ruling conceals the
fear of the ungovernable and ungovernablity from below. So even as we
now understand that power is diffuse and relational (à la Foucault),30
state addiction ensures that; the state remains at the fulcrum of our
understanding of political power31 and state reifification
persists32---its promiscuous genealogy, its prodigious technologies, its
capacious fantasies, and its monstrous realities.33 Within the context
of an ever-growing global war on terror, the resurrection of works by
the Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt has granted little relief from
our state addiction.34 If anything, his intervention further ensures
that the specter of the elusive state is finally vanquished. In its
place is a state more capable than the technologies it possesses, more
intelligible than the apparatuses it readied, and more autonomous than
the subjects it has claimed.35 Students of the Black Radical Tradition,
however, are familiar with this phenomenon. Just as "every slave holder
seeks to impress his slave with a belief in the boundlessness of slave
territory, and of his own almost \[limitless\] power,"36 so, too, it
seems, is the case with other dominions, including discursive ones. It
is also the case that slaves did run away, and many ran away
successfully!

[Because the state **presupposes** the ungovernable, it points to
ungovernability as the **reason for its existence** and its **capacious
fantasies, justifying both**, even as its very **existence** **produces
insecurity**]{.underline}.37 But life as we know it is quite
complicated.38 That we can speak of "governmentality"---as the conduct
of statehood and a logic of governing---is precisely because complex
personhood throws up ungovernability every time the state and other
dominions mess with it. [Population management is **critical** to the
conduct of government **precisely because** the people **have to be
made** into **governable subjects**]{.underline}. [People have to be
rendered governable because they are ungoverned as a **precondition**,
and therefore are **not legible to the state.**]{.underline} It is not
that our presence and complex person-hood incite governing. Rather,
[governing **incites its prodigious technologies** as it encounters life
**countering it** or **independent of it**.]{.underline} Governing is a
possessively jealous beast!

That [**singular obsession** with **how** we shall be governed should be
a cause of **great concern**]{.underline}, especially [for]{.underline}
those whom Sara Ahmed calls "willful [subjects]{.underline}"6---those
who do not look to be ruled, as well as those [who **actively refuse to
be ruled,** including making themselves **unavailable for
governing**]{.underline}. Indeed, [**democratic living**, as a way of
collectivizing, concerns itself not with **how we should be governed**,
but with how we should **live and relate to one another**]{.underline}.7
[In an era characterized by **neoliberalism**, **wars**, and
**empires**]{.underline}, not to mention extreme [**wealth inequality,
mass incarceration**, **police homicides**, and **deportations**,
livability may be **predicated**]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
democratic living, [a praxis that can provide an **alternative mode of
bein**g and of conducting **critical social inquiries**,]{.underline}
especially about the future of Black radical thought and praxis.8

This essay builds on Cedric Robinson's critique in The Terms of Order of
the political and political authority and revises James Scott's
treatment of "the art of not being governed"9 to draw attention to the
multiple ways in which ordinary people and communities resist governing
by state and non-state rule-making projects. Historically runaway slaves
looked to the North Star not to be ruled by it, but to use its
illumination as a guide to freedom. [The practice of **marronage** is
embodied democratic living]{.underline} (however momentarily) [and the
**willful attempt** to **resist being governed**]{.underline}. [Through
**community building**, where the **terror** and **violence of racial
capitalism** and **white supremacy** were]{.underline} temporarily
**[suspended]{.underline}**, free ~~men and women~~ negotiated their own
terms of living, and in the process, negated the terms of order.10
Following Avery F. Gordon's suggestion that we need to "combine complex
and acute social analysis with a vision of how some people have lived
and do live today that is a model for how all of us could live," and
Cedric Robinson's insistence that **[marronage]{.underline}** (flight
and fugitivity) [proves the existence of **Black radical consciousness**
and **praxis**]{.underline}, I look to the willful refusal to be
governed as confirmation of democratic sensibility.11 [This]{.underline}
sensibility, I argue, [is an **antidote** to the **chronic state
addiction** that seems to affect many **social** and]{.underline}
especially **[political theorists]{.underline}**, and provides an
imperative for thinking about and learning from Black radical thought
and praxis.

A DETOUR: STATE ADDICTION AND UNGOVERNABILITY

[Democratic living constitutes life forms that **actively seek
independence** from rule **making.**]{.underline} [This
**ungovernability from below** constantly threatens the **unjust peace
of dominant orders**, including **settler colonialism, racial
capitalism, white supremacy**, and **hetero-patriarchy**]{.underline}.12
While contestations among the elites are frequent, they do not represent
ungoverning and are quite different from the active refusal to be
governed from below. The federal government shutdown, out-of-control
police and prison guards, and unregulated hyper-speculative finance, for
instance, are not ungoverning at the top. Instead, they are a form of
governance that incites instability as a consequence of its incompetence
and delinquency. In contrast, [ungovernability from below represents the
inability of state and other dominions to assert control over subjects;
the ungovernable, therefore, are those individuals and communities that
render themselves unavailable for governing]{.underline}. In this way,
[the refusal **to be governed** is at the core of]{.underline} popular
[resistance to **all forms of dominions.**]{.underline}13

#### Reject state-centrism in favor of building [ungovernable communities]{.underline} --- endorsing [maroon]{.underline}, [fugitive]{.underline}, and [indigenous being]{.underline} can [trip up the system]{.underline} and [reshape]{.underline} the political sphere --- their indicts are [ahistorical]{.underline}.

ungovernability is not about empirical verification, but about the
epistemological investments in political order and a modern ontological
commitment to governability.29 This commitment to ruling conceals the
fear of the ungovernable and ungovernablity from below. So even as we
now understand that power is diffuse and relational (à la Foucault),30
[**state addiction** **ensures** that; the **state** remains at the
**fulcrum of our understanding of political power**]{.underline}31 and
**[state reifification persists]{.underline}**32---its promiscuous
genealogy, its prodigious technologies, its capacious fantasies, and its
monstrous realities.33

Within the context of an ever-growing global war on terror, the
resurrection of works by the Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt has
granted little relief from our state addiction.34 If anything, his
intervention further ensures that the specter of the elusive state is
finally vanquished. In its place is a state more capable than the
technologies it possesses, more intelligible than the apparatuses it
readied, and more autonomous than the subjects it has claimed.35
Students of the Black Radical Tradition, however, are familiar with this
phenomenon. Just as "every slave holder seeks to impress his slave with
a belief in the boundlessness of slave territory, and of his own almost
\[limitless\] power,"36 so, too, it seems, is the case with other
dominions, including discursive ones. It is also the case that slaves
did run away, and many ran away successfully!

Because the state presupposes the ungovernable, it points to
ungovernability as the reason for its existence and its capacious
fantasies, justifying both, even as its very existence produces
insecurity.37 But life as we know it is quite complicated.38 That we can
speak of "governmentality"---as the conduct of statehood and a logic of
governing---is precisely because complex personhood throws up
ungovernability every time the state and other dominions mess with it.
Population management is critical to the conduct of government precisely
because the people have to be made into governable subjects. People have
to be rendered governable because they are ungoverned as a precondition,
and therefore are not legible to the state. It is not that our presence
and complex person-hood incite governing. Rather, governing incites its
prodigious technologies as it encounters life countering it or
independent of it. Governing is a possessively jealous beast!

So Rose, however famed he was, must be famously wrong! Throughout
history, as noted, [individuals and communities have **always resisted
modernity's state-building**]{.underline} and rule-making
[projects]{.underline}. [In addition to anti--state-building projects
such as those by the]{.underline} hill [peoples of Zomia]{.underline}
(as documented by James Scott39), campaigns for bodily and community
sovereignty, sometimes understood as forms of self-government, are well
documented. These are often in reaction to or in anticipation of
state-building and rule-making projects. [**Maroon societies** are thus
the **embodiment** of this **refusal of rule making**]{.underline}.
[James Scott characterizes]{.underline} the hill peoples as **[runaways
and fugitives.]{.underline}**40 In addition to these state-evaders,
however, there is the motley crew of rule-evaders who elude rules and
rule making that are outside of the state's perogatives. [**Runaways,
border-crossers, gender-benders, and general
nonconformists**]{.underline} are such examples of failures of or
**[resist]{.underline}**ance to [**codified practices** of
**governing**]{.underline}. [These **legacies of
resistance**]{.underline},41 [replete with \[people\]]{.underline}
~~women and men~~ [**actively countering** the many faces, **structures,
and technologies** of violence]{.underline}, cruelty, and death,
[**cannot** be dismissed simply as **nonsense**]{.underline}. While we
may never be able to completely escape state addiction and it would be
foolish to stop interrogating the state altogether, the state's memory,
however, must not be our only memory. Those who seek a more just present
and future must, therefore, remain vigilantly skeptical of this
affliction in order to recognize how others live, especially other
genealogies and life forms that are independent of the imaginaries of
the state and of capital.42

[Ferguson or Syria, the ungovernable withhold both **consent** and

**imperial**]{.underline}. How many years has it been since the United

In The Terms of Order, Cedric Robinson calls for a social philosophy
that rejects the political as an "ordering principle," maintaining that
social order is folklore of the state, political order is an alien
concept, and social leaders, more often than not, are "capricious,
incompetent and mischievous."43 To demystify social order is also to
interrogate how in the West, the very idea of freedom is singularly
wedded to the idea of an autonomous and rational individual, yet the
collectivity always requires governing.44 [By **pivoting to
ungovernability** instead of the naturalness of the **need to be
governed**, we expose the **unnaturalness** and **illegitimacy of
order.**]{.underline}

[People rendering themselves unavailable for governing **trips up the
system**]{.underline}, more often than not, [leading to **crises of
authority** and further exposing **elite incompetence** and
**delinquencies**]{.underline}.45 Be it in midwives of civil strife,

**unjust peace** of the organized practices that render subjects
governable.]{.underline}

What Toni Morrison calls "rememory,"47 particularly **[fugitive
rememory]{.underline}**, [is a necessary tool in the evaders' and
rebels' **quest for wholeness**, or what Robinson calls "the
preservation of \[an\] **ontological totality**."]{.underline}48 As
Robinson insisted in Black Movements in America, [**running away** and
**community building** in the form of **maroon societies** are
**powerful counterexamples** of the conceit of slavery---the claims of
naturalness of **people as property** and the arrogant assumption that a
people, any people, can be **controlled, dominated
totally**]{.underline}. Totalitarianism frequently fails for a reason.

FLIGHT, FUGITIVITY, AND TIME TRAVELS

The act of running away, of building independent communities, is a
catalogue of slavery as an unnatural political, economic, and moral
ordering. [**Community** building]{.underline}, [rather
than]{.underline} nation or **[state building]{.underline}**, [provides
a way of **knowing about forms of life** outside the **state** and
**other dominions**]{.underline}; [marronage is thus a historical
verification of life outside of the terms of slavery as a natural
order.]{.underline}
