The data model that correctly predicted last year's Democratic "blue
wave" victory in the midterm elections says [President Donald Trump may
have already lost in 2020]{.underline}. The model by Rachel Bitecofer,
which doesn't rely on polls, [predicts **Trump will lose three states
that were key to his victory in 2020: Pennsylvania, Michigan and
Wisconsin**. And that will give his Democratic rival a clear path to the
White House.]{.underline} Bitecofer, of the Judy Ford Wason Center for
Public Policy at Christopher Newport University﻿, writes in a new
analysis that [Trump's 2016 victory was the political equivalent of
royal flush in poker. That's not going to happen again given how
"agitated" the Democratic voters are right now,]{.underline} she said.
Bitecofer bases her model on statewide estimates of voter turnout. "[The
complacent electorate of 2016, who were convinced Trump would never be
president, has been replaced with the terrified electorate of
2020]{.underline}, who are convinced he's the Terminator and can't be
stopped," she writes. "Under my model, that distinction is not only
important, it is everything." In addition to not relying on poll
aggregators, [her model **also doesn't rely on a specific nominee**. She
said whoever Trump's rival is won't matter much "unless it ends up being
a disruptor like Bernie Sanders]{.underline}." With Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Wisconsin in the fold, the model finds that a [Democratic
candidate has 278 electoral votes from "safe," "likely" or "lean"
states. Trump has just 197 in those categories.]{.underline} [Even if he
wins all of the toss-up states in Bitecofer's model such as Florida,
he'll still fall short of the 270 needed to win reelection]{.underline}.
However, she said there are still factors that could change the outcome,
such as the arrival of a well-financed independent such as ex-Starbucks
CEO Howard Schultz or "significant disruption" such as war, recession, a
terrorist attack. She also said Republican turnout will increase, with
90 percent of them voting for Trump along with at least 38 percent of
independents. "Trump has a floor that is at least theoretically
competitive for reelection and will force Democrats to compete hard to
win the presidency," she wrote. She [said the Democrat turnout surge
will be larger in many states, and added that the eventual nominee will,
in fact, matter at least to some extent.]{.underline} "If the ticket has
a woman, a person of color or a Latino, or a female who is also a person
of color, Democratic Party turnout will surge more in really important
places," she said. If it's a white man such as former Vice President Joe
Biden, increasing turnout should be the top consideration for choosing a
running mate.

Donald Trump on Tuesday once again lashed out at his home state,
alleging that New York was waging a campaign of "political harassment"
against the National Rifle Association---a longtime bedrock of
Republican support that has recently begun to show fractures. "Our great
N.R.A." is a "victim of harassment" by New York Attorney General Letitia
James, Trump wrote, suggesting the organization should pack up and move
to a gun-friendly state like Texas. [Trump's attempt to dismiss the
turmoil at the NRA was not unselfish; if the NRA loses its potency, his
own 2020 campaign could be in trouble]{.underline}. This anxiety is
reportedly permeating the president's campaign, where according to
Politico, officials are concerned about losing a major source of
infrastructure in key states. "[No organization has been more important
to conservative voter education and engagement than the
N.R.A.,"]{.underline} former American Conservative Union executive
director Gregg Keller told Politico. "[We all hope they're able to mount
the kind of effort in the 2020 cycle they have in the past. But in case
they can't, given their current situation, I hope they're being
forthright about that within the movement so others can pick up the
slack]{.underline}." [Tumult at the NRA has been brewing for the better
part of a year]{.underline} amid financial difficulties and political
and legal scrutiny, but [has been exacerbated thanks to]{.underline} a
wave of embarrassing [reports about infighting, self-dealing, and the
resignations of top officials, including its chief lobbyist, Chris Cox,
last month.]{.underline} Cox, the group's primary political strategist,
had been suspended after being implicated in a failed coup attempt
against NRA CEO Wayne La Pierre ahead of the outfit's annual convention
in April. [Oliver North, the NRA's president who led the failed revolt,
resigned that month.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [the organization is being
scrutinized following New Yorker reports about its shady financial
practices, including possible self-dealing]{.underline}. [Those reports
triggered an investigation from James into the NRA's finances that could
put its nonprofit status at risk]{.underline}---something that hasn't
sat well with the group or with Trump, whose 2016 campaign was bolstered
by the powerful gun lobby. "The N.R.A. is under siege by \[Gov. Andrew
Cuomo\] and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the State's
legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important
organization, & others," Trump tweeted, providing no support for his
claim that Cuomo and James were abusing their power. "It must get its
act together quickly, stop the internal fighting, & get back to
GREATNESS --- FAST!" [But in the months since, things have only gotten
worse. Last week, the group announced it was shuttering NRATV, the
online propaganda arm it launched in 2016, and severed ties with
controversial spokeswoman Dana Loesch]{.underline}. The upheaval, per
Politico, has stoked fears among the Trump campaign and Republicans that
the "organization will be profoundly diminished heading into the
election, leaving the Republican Party with a gaping hole in its
political machinery." Party officials say the NRA has played a key role
in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and
Wisconsin---states where Trump is suffering in polls. "The situation has
folks nervous," Keller said. Of course, even if the organization is not
able to play the role it did in Trump's 2016 campaign in 2020, the
president may emerge unscathed. With \$105 million raised between the
Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee in the second
quarter of 2019, he's far outpacing not just his 2016 bid, but also what
then-President Barack Obama raised during the same period, the New York
Times reported Tuesday. That deep well of resources may give him an
advantage, despite his enduring unpopularity with the broader American
electorate. [Still, the NRA's imminent crisis---and a political pullback
by the Chamber of Commerce and the Koch brothers, two other key support
centers for Republicans---may put stress on the president's campaign and
associated PACs, and spell trouble for Republicans in the longer
term.]{.underline} "Right now, the party is functioning," former
Republican Congressman David McIntosh, president of the conservative
Club for Growth, told Politico. "[But if you see another collapse or if
we lose the White House, I think you're going to see Republicans frankly
in a world of hurt without a major funding group like
that."]{.underline}

[Trump ha]{.underline}s very real [assets in]{.underline} the
[2020]{.underline} campaign he didn't have last time. Incumbency,
combined with a good economy, is historically an electoral boon to
presidents. "We think the (key) difference this time is that the
president has a record of achievements to run on and chief among them
probably is the economy," said Murtaugh of the Trump campaign. [But the
picture is complicated by Trump's capacity to **electrify** voters on
both sides]{.underline} ---those who love him and those who hate him
[--- and]{.underline} his **[persistently negative approval
ratings]{.underline}**. The president's job ratings are a bit better in
Wisconsin than they are nationally, and they will probably have to be
for him to win the state a second time. In a statewide survey released
this month by the Marquette Law School, 46% of registered voters
approved of his performance and 52% disapproved. Those were among his
better numbers in more than two years of polling by Marquette. But
[Trump's approval has been perpetually "underwater" in Wisconsin and
nationally]{.underline} (meaning more people disapprove than approve).
His job ratings here are markedly worse than Obama's were in Obama's
re-election year. [They are also worse than those of]{.underline} GOP
Gov. Scott [Walker]{.underline} going into Walker's 2018 re-election ---

[A Wason Poll election forecast model released Monday morning predicts a

hyper-polarized and motivated factions that will spell defeat for
President Trump in 2020. But pollsters and pundits got it wrong in
2016.]{.underline} "Yep, predictably people wonder, 'ok, everyone was so
confident Trump would lose in 2016 and here is just another example of
that overconfidence,\" says Bitecofer. But she says [that very
overconfidence in a Trump loss then was precisely why he won and now,
"Democrats are not going to believe the polls and be too afraid not to
show up."]{.underline} She says [they are powered by a large enthusiasm
advantage that will lead to, "Increasing their turnout and really
flipping back that Midwest." She says the same "Negative Partisanship"
model predicted "almost to the seat," the Democrat's 40 seat gain in the
House in 2018.]{.underline}

[But in a presidential race, a party can\'t divide and
conquer]{.underline}. Only one ticket will go up against Donald Trump
and Mike Pence in 2020 --- and [in an almost comically large early
field, most of the Democratic candidates are running as
progressives]{.underline}. And they\'re not just running to the left of
the party\'s recent positions on some issues while staking out more
moderate stances in other areas. [Most of the candidates are running as
progressives on everything at once: health care, immigration, taxes,
child care, college loans, abortion, guns, transgender rights, and on
and on.]{.underline} If the structural problems confronting the party
didn\'t exist, this might make sense. Democrats could just try to run up
the vote in the country\'s biggest and most liberal cities on the
rationale that more votes is more votes, no matter where they come from.
But of course this isn\'t the way the game is played in the United
States. [To win the presidency, Democrats still need to prevail in
states where the population isn\'t very progressive --- or where it
might be potentially progressive in some areas of policy (health care)
but not in others (abortion, immigration, guns). Denying this fact
won\'t make it go away. That progressives have ended up in this position
just two and a half years after Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by
three million and yet still lost to Trump is astonishing]{.underline}.
(You wouldn\'t know it from listening to Bernie Sanders supporters, but
Clinton ran a strongly progressive campaign in 2016.) A big factor in
that lopsided popular-vote outcome was California, where Clinton beat
Trump by 4.3 million votes, 61 percent to 31 percent. Listening to the
leading candidates on stage last week, [it sounded at times like their
main electoral goal is to win California with 80 percent next time
around and so prevail in the national popular vote by something more
like five million. That would be an impressive achievement for the
Democrats. But they would still lose the presidency --- and might also
lose the Senate as well]{.underline}.

President Donald [Trump has never been able to reach a
50-percent]{.underline} job-[approval rating]{.underline} in mainstream
opinion surveys, a historically poor polling performance for a
commander-in-chief. **[Doesn't matter]{.underline}**. [**He's still on
his way to re-election, say seasoned political data analysts.** Yale
professor Ray Fair's]{.underline} long-established [political model
relies on the economy]{.underline} \-- specifically the [gross domestic
product]{.underline} and inflation \-- [to predict election
outcomes]{.underline}. Former Obama Administration official Steven
Rattner pointed out this week that, according Fair's model, "Mr. Trump's
vote share would ordinarily be as high as 56.1 percent. But that's
before factoring in his personality." [Even with Trump's temperament
pulling down his total, **he'll still win**, the Yale Model
concludes]{.underline}. [His vote should end up at about **54
percent**]{.underline}. His Democratic opponent is expected to get only
45.4 percent. [American University professor Allan
Lichtman]{.underline}, one of the few political prognosticators in 2016
who predicted Trump would win, **[has come to the same
conclusion]{.underline}**. He too believes the president will win again
next year. [His method involves examining **13 determinants** ranging
from whether there's a serious third-party candidate to the health of
the economy]{.underline}. "Trump wins again in 2020 unless six of 13 key
factors turn against him," Lichtman told CNN this week. "I have no final
verdict yet because much could change during the next year. Currently,
the President is down only three keys: Republican losses in the \[2018\]
midterm elections, the lack of a foreign policy success, and the
president's limited appeal to voters." [Lichtman]{.underline}, who [has
**correctly predicted every presidential election for more than three
decades**]{.underline}, believes impeachment would be another "key"
counting against Trump, even though polls indicate the American people
don't want the U.S. House of Representatives to impeach the president.
Then there's [Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi]{.underline}.
[He has run 12 models that look at "economic trends at the state level"
to predict the upcoming]{.underline} presidential [election. **Trump
triumphs in all of them.**]{.underline} "[If the election were held
today,"]{.underline} Zandi said recently, "[Trump would win according to
the models \-- **and pretty handily**]{.underline}. In three or four of
them it would be pretty close. [He's got low gas prices, low
unemployment and a lot of other political variables at his
back]{.underline}. The only exception is his popularity, which matters a
lot. If that falls off a cliff it would make a big difference." Another
modeler, [Trend Macrolytics' Donald Luskin]{.underline},
[also]{.underline} has [concluded that]{.underline} President [Trump
will romp to victory next year.]{.underline} The [hyper-partisan
political environment in the U.S. means that most votes are essentially
locked in]{.underline} for one candidate or the other [regardless of
outside factors.]{.underline} Independents, along with the small number
of disaffected Republicans and Democrats, likely will direct the 2020
election result. [Incumbency]{.underline} \-- that is, simply being a
sitting president \-- [historically has **proven a powerful advantage**,
and the state of the economy often drives voters who are not unswerving
partisans.]{.underline}

President\'s reviews on issues other than the economy remain largely
negative.]{.underline}

[The new poll finds 54% say their best guess is that Trump will win the

second term in May 2011, in a survey conducted just after the death of
Osama bin Laden]{.underline} (50% thought Obama would win in that poll).
The new numbers on Trump are a reversal from December, when a narrow
majority of 51% said they thought Trump would lose his bid for
re-election.

The shift over that time comes mostly among those who disapprove of
Trump\'s handling of the presidency. [In December, 81% in that group

67%. At the same time, the share who approve of the President and think

But [if the Democrats drill beneath the surface they will see that there
is much for them to worry about regarding their chances of defeating
Trump in the 2020 election.]{.underline} For one thing, [Trump remains
remarkably popular among white voters, especially white men. In a
Quinnipiac University poll released on June 11,]{.underline} Trump
trailed all the leading Democratic candidates[. Among white voters,
however, Trump beat every major Democratic presidential candidate by a
margin of six to 10 points --- with one exception. Biden and Trump were
in a statistical tie, with the latter leading by 47% to
46%]{.underline}, within the survey\'s margin of error. [Other national
polls have consistently shown that Donald Trump wins among white voters
by an average of 10 points.]{.underline} In some ways this is
predictable. The Republican Party is the country\'s largest white
identity organization. The two major parties are increasingly sorted by
racial attitudes, and those white voters who are the most hostile
towards nonwhites have found their natural home in the Republican Party.
Conservatism is a system of motivated social cognition; racism and
racial authoritarianism are among its key features. In today\'s
extremely polarized environment, political values are a reflection of
social identity. Because of this, whiteness rules supreme for many Trump
and Republican voters. Duke University political scientist Ashley
Jardina explained this to me in a phone conversation: The idea behind
white identity politics is that there is a subset of white voters and/or
white Americans in general who feel a sense of attachment to their
group. They feel a sense of solidarity. They think that their race and
their racial identity is important to who they are, and that influences
how they see and view the political world. Tied up in that sense of
identity is the belief that whites are losing out in the United States
and that their status and their power are somehow under threat.
Subsequently, these white voters are responding to that politically by
supporting policies and candidates that they view as protecting their
group and preserving its status. Donald Trump is a candidate who
campaigned on lowering levels of immigration, building a wall, and doing
things that were going to preserve the \"right\" composition of the
country, as viewed by those white Americans who feel embattled. He
promised to provide and support policies like Social Security and
Medicare that are associated with whiteness and disproportionately
benefit white people. [Trump is going to keep \"America First\" and
\"Make America Great Again\" He is very much the candidate of white
identity.]{.underline} Of course white identity mattered before Trump
came on the scene, as Jardina also noted: \"One thing that we know is
that whites who felt a strong sense of solidarity with their group in
2012 were far less likely to vote for Obama.\" What is most troubling
for American democracy and the general future of the country is the fact
that [Trump\'s white voters support him despite his evident collusion
with a foreign power to influence the 2016 presidential election, his
habitual lying, his authoritarian beliefs and attitudes and his gross
disregard for the Constitution.]{.underline} Trump has been accused of
sexual assault or sexual harassment by at least 22 women. He has put
brown and black children and families in concentration camps. [He has
conducted a dangerous and irresponsible foreign policy, has further
destroyed the environment, gutting America\'s prestige and respect
around the world, has pursued ruinous economic policies and a pattern of
evident corruption, has openly admired dictators and despots and
embraced the politics of white supremacy.]{.underline}

[A simple statistical model applied to recorded approval ratings shows

growing. This is in direct contrast to all presidents except Bill

[When the votes are counted on November 6]{.underline}, all of this
could turn out to be spot-on --- or [some of it could be dramatically
wrong]{.underline}. As polls come in during the final days of the
election, we should keep in mind two reasons why what they're showing
now might not necessarily be what we see on Election Day. First,
[there's the possibility that the polls could shift in these final days.
This could be due to new developments in individual races, like scandals
breaking or candidates ramping up ad spending. A change in national news
headlines could also benefit one party or the other generally. Remember,
it was just a week and a half before the election that FBI Director
James Comey disclosed that the FBI had found new Clinton emails.
Analysts think this played a major role in swinging the polls, and Nate
Silver later concluded it "probably cost Clinton the
election."]{.underline} Second, [there's the possibility that the polls
could just be off]{.underline}, or missing something. [Pollsters could
be wrongly modeling turnout, to the benefit of one party and detriment
of the other. Undecided voters making up their minds at the very last
minute]{.underline} could also break disproportionately to one candidate
or side, either nationally or in particular races or regions. [Pollsters
famously underestimated Donald Trump's support in the Midwest by several
points in 2016, and it was only a year ago that Virginia polls
underestimated Democrat Ralph Northam's margin of victory by more than
5.5 percentage points.]{.underline} X

That's an uncommonly big miss. But [it's quite common for the final
polling averages to be off by a few points]{.underline} for any
particular race. Just look at what happened with polling averages in
some of the highest-profile Trump-era special elections:

margin by 3.7 percentage points Pennsylvania's 18th District:
Overestimated the Democrat's margin by 1.8 points Arizona's Eighth
District: Overestimated the Republican's margin by 2.8
points]{.underline} In all these contests, the polls were in the
neighborhood of the final outcome. But [they were off in the low single
digits in all of them --- and by more than that in the Virginia
governor's race.]{.underline} That's, then, what polls are generally
good for --- getting us in the neighborhood of the outcome, most of the
time. But [we shouldn't exaggerate their precision or how much certainty
they offer. Election night will likely bring some
surprises.]{.underline}

[On military intervention, Democrats could find themselves scooped by
the president. He is undoubtedly reckless and militaristic, but he also
seems acutely aware of the risks of large-scale military
action]{.underline}. He recently publicly rebuked John Bolton, his
national-security adviser, for pushing for military intervention in
Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. [Trump's militarism could see the
United States embroiled in a war between now and the election, but there
is a strong possibility that he will avoid one.]{.underline} Yes, the
United States remains involved in Afghanistan and Syria, but Trump wants
to pull out of both conflicts and may ultimately insist on it as the
election looms. [The argument that Americans must pivot to the home
front may fare no better.]{.underline} This has been Trump's mantra for
years. The results of his renegotiations of trade deals may be poor, and
he has not fulfilled his promise to invest in infrastructure, but he has
already made the rhetoric that the Democrats are trying to adopt his
own. Moreover, he may be able to tell many voters that he's succeeded.
The present economic boom started under Obama, but it doesn't really
matter---if it extends through next November, voters will credit Trump.
And, as David Gordon of the Eurasia Group observes, the states Trump won
in 2016, including many that suffered during the Great Recession, are
experiencing higher levels of job growth than the rest of the country.
[That leaves Democrats with international cooperation as their best hope
of distinguishing their foreign-policy message from Trump's. But a
recent study of public opinion by the Center for American Progress found
that this will prove a tough sell: Language from foreign policy experts
about '**fighting authoritarianism and dictatorship**,' 'promoting
democracy,' or 'working with allies and the international community'
**uniformly fell flat with voters** in our groups. Some participants
questioned the idea that an international community actually
exists.]{.underline} Democracy promotion reminded others of the 2003
Iraq War and the failures of the George W. Bush administration. [When
asked what the phrase 'maintaining the liberal international order'
indicated to them, all but one of the participants in our focus groups
drew a blank. Voters across educational lines simply did not understand
what any of these phrases and ideas meant or implied.]{.underline} The
inconvenient truth for the Democratic field is that [Trump's crude
foreign-policy message could resonate in 2020. He promises to remove
constraints and use power freely, including against America's friends,
to extract more economic benefits.]{.underline} The benefits may be
smaller than advertised. His approach may come at the cost of eroding
America's global influence and replacing the rules-based international
order with something temporary, fragile, and transactional. He may be
even more radical in his second term. [Trump's presidency may
dramatically increase the risk of a national-security
catastrophe---character is fate. But, until the catastrophe actually
arrives, Trump is unlikely to be hurt politically. Many voters are only
too pleased to have a president willing to shake things up
internationally.]{.underline}

--- President Donald Trump\'s path to re-election runs through an
alternate voter universe. [Rather than build from his base, like a
traditional politician, Trump is trying to expand his base and make it a
larger share of the overall electorate. The idea is for his campaign,
which has begun to ramp up in recent weeks, to identify, keep in contact
with, and mobilize a new set of pro-Trump voters who typically don\'t go
to the polls. If it works, they will fundamentally change the so-called
universe of voters, offsetting the loss of suburban Republicans at a
time when his overall approval ratings remain far below the break-even
point.]{.underline} In 2020, a majority want someone new in WH: poll
MARCH 12, 201901:49 \"[The successes of this presidency are fueling a
groundswell of support and are bringing in new voters,\"]{.underline}
said Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for the Trump campaign.
[That helps explain why Trump has been all about his base, even after a
midterm election in which House Republicans were handed a resounding
defeat and the GOP lost gubernatorial races in Midwestern battlegrounds
that were key to his 2016 victory. It\'s an echo of his strategy the
first time around, when his 2016 campaign pounded away to bring
conservative non-voters to the polls in swing states.]{.underline} His
team points to a February rally in El Paso, Texas, as a model for the
president\'s outreach in 2020. [At that venue, where Trump promoted his
signature border wall, nearly half of the attendees were people who had
voted no more than once in the last four elections,]{.underline}
including many registered Democrats, according to the campaign. \"These
are new voters that we intend to bring into the Trump coalition,\"
McEnany said over e-mail. \"Our data operation is unmatched in the
history of American politics. We will identify a particular universe of
both swing voters and low propensity voters based on voter score data
and will use our historic army of volunteers to make contact with every
voter necessary to ensure President Trump's re-election.\" \"Voter score
data\" is the way the Trump campaign and its partner, the Republican
National Committee, classify prospective voters based on their
propensity of showing up to the polls, their issue interests and the
likelihood that they will pull the lever for the president. Both parties
use similar methods to identify targets for turnout and persuasion
efforts, as well as modeling how candidates will perform in elections.
One danger in using such data, political strategists have long warned,
is that it can be misunderstood as an end rather than a tool for
developing strategy and tactics. Another is the possibility that the
underlying data aren\'t as precise as the campaigns would like them to
be --- or believe they are. And a third is that focusing intently on a
candidate\'s existing supporters can lead a campaign to develop messages
that alienate and energize voters outside the target groups who end up
supporting the other side. MSNBC\'s Steve Kornacki wrote in an analysis
for NBC News last week that [Trump\'s approval ratings are virtually
inelastic --- that most Americans\' views on the president aren\'t
subject to change --- which could lead to the conclusion that Trump\'s
best shot at re-election is to find non-voters who agree with him and
drive them to the polls.]{.underline}

Foreign policy is getting placed on the back burner as 2020 Democratic
presidential candidates look for a breakout moment in the party's
crowded field. [But Democratic senators and strategists are clamoring
for White House hopefuls to talk up the issue, arguing President Trump
is vulnerable on national security after sparking a series of
international dust-ups during his presidency. "It's an enormous point of
political exposure for this president. He continues to screw up
everything in every corner of the world,"]{.underline} said Sen. Chris
Murphy (D-Conn.), a leading voice within the Senate Democratic caucus on
foreign policy. "[We have the opportunity to close the national security
gap with Republicans in 2020, so I would hope that Democrats see this as
an opportunity."]{.underline} Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the party's 2016
vice presidential nominee and a member of the Senate Armed Services and
Foreign Relations committees, argued that [Trump's record gives
Democrats a "powerful critique" to make on foreign policy. "When you get
to the general election, 'we'll do a better job with the economy, and we
will keep you safer than this administration']{.underline} --- those are
the two selling points that any Democratic candidate has to be able to
make," Kaine said. Trump rose through the GOP primary by eschewing
traditional Republican foreign policy, including taking a combative
stance toward the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), knocking
George W. Bush-era wars and arguing the United States should step back
from its global watchdog role. [But since taking office, Trump has
reached boiling points with countries including Venezuela and Iran;
drawn rebukes for his warm relationship with Russian President Vladimir
Putin; stood by Saudi Arabia after the death of Washington Post
contributor Jamal Khashoggi; walked back his pledge to withdraw U.S.
troops from Syria; and ripped up Obama-era legacies such as the Paris
climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal.]{.underline} Ned Price,
director of policy and communications at the progressive National
Security Action, [said Democratic candidates "should be going on
offense" given Trump's record.]{.underline} "[There is some fertile
ground when it comes to this area, precisely because of the hole that
Trump has dug for himself. They should be going on offense. They should
be attacking Trump\'s record,"]{.underline} said Price, who was a
spokesman for Obama's National Security Council. He added that after
decades of Republicans being viewed as having the national security
mantle, "[it would be a real waste of an opportunity to stick solely to
domestic issues. I do think that you\'ve seen Democrats recognize this
and act on it.\"]{.underline} National Security Action, which advises
some of the 2020 Democratic presidential campaigns, released a survey
late last month that found voters had a net positive view of Trump on
national security --- 55 percent approval compared to 45 percent
disapproval. But the survey also showed that Trump has net negatives
when it comes to relations with North Korea, Venezuela, Russia and other
countries. [Forty-seven percent of undecided 2020 voters said
that]{.underline} while they approve of Trump's actions on national
security, [they worry he lacks the temperament to be
president.]{.underline} And while former Vice President Joe Biden is the
Democratic candidate with the most experience in the foreign policy
arena, other White House hopefuls are stepping up their efforts to
outline their proposals. [The Hill's review of websites for the 10
Democratic candidates who are leading in the polls, based on
FiveThirtyEight tracking, found that eight of them have issue sections
dedicated to foreign policy or national security.]{.underline} The level
of detail varies across campaigns. Biden, for example, discusses
restoring U.S. leadership globally and includes sections on "using
military power responsibly" and recommitting to U.S. allies; Sen. Bernie
Sanders (I-Vt.) has bullet points detailing a "responsible,
comprehensive foreign policy"; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who
has come in third in several recent polls, includes a section about a
"foreign policy for all." Sanders came under criticism from former
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her allies during the 2016
presidential campaign for his lack of foreign policy experience. He said
in a CNN town hall earlier this year that his increased focus on the
area was one way he has changed since the previous campaign. \"I think I
was rightfully criticized the last time I ran, but I didn\'t pay as much
attention as I might," he said. "I think a little bit more about foreign
policy issues than I previously did." Some of the 2020 contenders have
given major foreign policy speeches in recent years, including Sanders
in 2017 and Warren last year. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg
(D), who served in Afghanistan, is scheduled to give one next week.
Warren stirred early talk of her 2020 ambitions when she joined the
Senate Armed Services Committee in 2017. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is a
member of the Foreign Relations Committee, while fellow White House
contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee. But it's not clear whether their early
strategizing on foreign policy has spilled over into the early voting
states, which have an outsize role in determining who ultimately snags
the party's nomination. The battle for the Democratic nomination is
being dominated by high-profile fights on domestic issues, ranging from
overhauling the courts to the Hyde Amendment, even as [Trump's foreign
policy has become a frequent flashpoint among long-standing U.S. allies
and with some of the president's top supporters on Capitol
Hill.]{.underline} A Des Moines Register analysis of questions 2020
Democratic candidates were getting from Iowans found that foreign policy
was low on the list of topics. Of the 38 questions Sanders was recorded
as receiving during events in the state in April, only one was
designated by the Register as pertaining to veterans affairs or military
issues. No questions were designated as foreign policy related. For
Warren, of the 12 questions The Des Moines Register recorded her being
asked, one was labeled as related to veterans affairs or military
issues. Most were about health care and education. Overall, according to
the analysis, candidates were quizzed primarily on health care, followed
by the environment and education. Across the entire field, they were
asked 13 questions on foreign policy, with half of those questions going
to former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas). On top of that, only 11 percent
of U.S. adults think national security and terrorism should be the top
priority for the federal government, according to an NBC News and Wall
Street Journal poll released last month. [Price said foreign policy
likely wasn't garnering national attention among voters because
Democrats are largely on the same page. But he predicted it would become
more of a factor as the election moves forward.]{.underline} "I tend to
think that we're not hearing about foreign policy in the same way that
we're hearing about health care because there's a lot of common ground,"
he said. "In the primary context, candidates tend to speak to what in
some ways makes them unique or differentiates them from the pack." Kaine
predicted that White House hopefuls were likely focused largely on
domestic policy because those were the types of questions they are
fielding from primary voters as they crisscross the country. "[I hope we
can articulate a real clear version of how we'll do a better job of
keeping Americans safe. That's how we flipped all these red seats to
blue in Virginia last year," Kaine said. "I think Americans want to hear
that from a Democratic presidential candidate."]{.underline}

[President Donald Trump is heading into the 2020 election with a pretty
solid foreign policy success story to sell American voters --- and
Democrats are struggling (but working) to come up with a coherent
message to counter it.]{.underline} In just two years in office, Trump
has achieved several big foreign policy wins: ISIS's caliphate has been
completely defeated. North Korea hasn't tested a nuclear bomb or
ballistic missile since 2017. The US defense budget has grown to
historically high levels. And Mexico and Canada have agreed to a new,
updated version of NAFTA that includes better protections for American
workers. And while there are certainly major caveats to all of those
"successes" --- and some serious foreign policy challenges, like the
trade war with China, conspicuously left off the list --- on paper at
least, it's a pretty strong record for Trump's first term in office.
Which means that [Democratic candidates looking to unseat Trump in 2020
will face a stiff challenge crafting a compelling
counternarrative]{.underline}. Of the more than 20 Democratic candidates
in the race so far, only [Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie
Sanders (I-VT) have presented anything like comprehensive foreign policy
platforms. Both candidates have outlined visions that focus on the broad
goals of championing democracy abroad and building economic strength at
home]{.underline} but offer few specifics on major issues like North
Korea, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and curbing the rise of China.
And the remaining candidates' [foreign policies remain largely unknown
or undeveloped at this stage in the contest. In the absence of a clear,
persuasive counternarrative to Trump's foreign policy success story,
policy experts have been trying to fill the gap, writing articles and
convening panels trying to help define what a progressive foreign policy
platform might look like.]{.underline} And on May 10, National Security
Action --- a nonprofit policy organization led by top former Obama
administration officials Ben Rhodes and Jake Sullivan --- will hold a
conference in Washington featuring top lawmakers, former government
officials, and leading experts to coalesce around a shared progressive
foreign policy vision. The conference, which has not previously been
reported, will include both establishment heavy hitters like former
Obama National Security Adviser Tom Donilon and former Obama White House
Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, as well as rising Democratic stars like
Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA).
Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Obama
White House, told me there's a reason for the event and the upswell in
activity. [Progressives feel "Trump's foreign policy represents a
profound emergency for the country,]{.underline}" he said, "and so
[there needs to be better coordination among them to push back against
what Trump is doing around the world]{.underline}." It's a Herculean
task. [The Democratic Party is a big tent, and the party's left flank is
increasingly out of step with more centrist Democrats who have espoused
traditional US foreign policy positions for decades. And progressives
have historically stumbled when trying to present a viable foreign
policy alternative to the more military- and security-focused
conservatives on the right.]{.underline} But Rhodes, Sullivan, and their
allies are on a mission to correct this deficiency once and for all ---
[first, by defining what a progressive foreign policy even is, and
second, by finding a way to sell that affirmative vision of America's
role in the world to voters in 2020.]{.underline}

#### 2020 elections are centered around fopo -- dems are using it as leverage

[Foreign policy rarely plays a major role in U.S.]{.underline}
presidential [elections]{.underline}. The United States has always been
an insular nation. Particularly for people in the American heartland,
the world's troubles seem far away. The connectivity of the modern world
and the globalization of terrorism have challenged that insularity, but
even so, national elections seldom pivot on international affairs.
**[2020 could be different]{.underline}**: **[Debates
over]{.underline}** American [**foreign policy** and national security
**could sway** enough **undecided voters** to tip the
scales]{.underline}, and the political battle lines are already forming.
As Alex Ward pointed out in Vox, President Donald [Trump is likely to
sell a story of foreign policy successes]{.underline} to voters in the
upcoming campaign: [that he defeated the Islamic State]{.underline};
[stopped North Korean nuclear and]{.underline} missile
[testing;]{.underline} repaired U.S. relations with Israel; pushed back
on Iran, Venezuela and Russia; fixed some trade problems; [increased
U.S. military spending]{.underline}; compelled some additional defense
spending in Europe; and made progress on an Afghanistan peace process.
How will Democrats respond? "We have to run on a proactive message of
our own," a campaign staffer to one Democratic presidential candidate
told Ward, "instead of spending all of our time attacking Trump." What
will that entail? Here are five key points that the Democratic
candidates, and the eventual presidential nominee, will likely use to
dispute Trump's narrative. First, the [Democrats will point out that
Trump has not resolved any major conflicts]{.underline} or eradicated
any threats, but just kicked the can down the road, leaving problems for
later presidents to deal with. [North Korea]{.underline}, for instance,
has [paused its weapons testing]{.underline} several times in the past
as a bargaining tool or simply because it didn't need to test them.
Everything suggests the current pause is one more instance of that,
[rather than a Trump-engineered diplomatic victory]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, the Islamic State has, in fact, lost its territorial
"caliphate" in Syria and Iraq, but it is far from defeated. Today it is
going underground and dispersing, biding its time until a later date. It
will be back, whether before the 2020 election or sometime after. Yet
[Trump has no integrated counter-ISIS strategy]{.underline} beyond
destroying its self-declared caliphate.

[Rolling into]{.underline} the [2020]{.underline} election, President
Donald [Trump is bound to tout his record on foreign policy as
a]{.underline} resounding [success]{.underline}. While he hasn't built a
wall and expensed it to Mexico, he has followed through on pledges to
withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate accord,
to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, to renegotiate NAFTA,
and to aggressively press China on trade. [He has delivered
on]{.underline} many of his [campaign promises,]{.underline} whether the
rest of the United States supports them or not. Mostly not, according to
public opinion surveys. [While American attitudes on foreign policy tend
to change very slowly]{.underline}, surveys conducted since Trump's
election in 2016 capture some interesting shifts, especially among
Democratic voters. [In the era of "America first]{.underline},"
[Democrats are even more likely than usual to rally behind U.S. allies
and multilateralism]{.underline}. Overwhelming majorities of Democrats
support the Iran nuclear agreement, the Paris climate accord, and
trade---all of which reads as a rebuke of Trump. What's more surprising
is that the public at large generally shares these views, though by more
modest majorities. With the first primary debates slated for Wednesday
and Thursday, [Democrats are]{.underline} clearly [looking for a leader
who can revive]{.underline} important [alliances]{.underline} that have
withered under Trump. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that [70
percent of Democrats]{.underline} and those leaning toward the
Democratic Party [rate improving relationships with U.S. allies as their
top foreign policy goal]{.underline}. Large majorities of Democrats also
say that U.S. relations with the rest of the world are worsening (85
percent, according an unpublished partisan breakdown of the 2018 Chicago
Council Survey) and the United States is losing allies (77 percent,
according to the same poll). The broader electorate feels similarly,
with 56 percent of Americans saying foreign relations are worsening and
57 percent saying the United States is losing allies. In this light,
[Trump's foreign policy "successes" look more like
liabilities]{.underline}. We should expect Trump's Democratic
challengers to exploit them.

Broad, [big-picture speeches on foreign policy are a mainstay of
presidential campaigns]{.underline}, so it\'s notable that the first two
likely [Democratic candidates]{.underline} to deliver them are senators
known more for their domestic agendas --- Sanders and Warren. \"As with
other elements of the Democratic Party,\" Rhodes said, \"the more
progressive wing of the party is beginning to frame the terms of the
debate.\" Both Sanders and Warren [made a point]{.underline} in their
speeches [of linking foreign policy back to the hearts of their agendas:
income inequality.]{.underline} \"Foreign policy is not just tied to
military affairs. [It is directly connected to economics]{.underline},\"
Sanders said last year in a speech at Westminster College. \"Foreign
policy must also take into account the outrageous income and wealth
inequality that exists globally and in our own country.\" Warren struck
a similar note last month at American University. \"[We need to end the
fiction that our domestic and our foreign policy are]{.underline}
somehow [separate]{.underline} from each other,\" she said, \"and
recognize that policies that undermine working families in this country
also erode America\'s strength in the world.\" Both progressives
attempted to thread the needle between a broad, America-As-World-Police
approach to international politics, and President Trump\'s isolationist
views. \"The goal is not for the United States to dominate the world,\"
Sanders said last year. \"Nor, on the other hand, is our goal to
withdraw from the international community and shirk our responsibilities
under the banner of \'America First.\' [Our goal should be global
engagement]{.underline} based on partnership, rather than dominance.
This is better for our security, better for global stability and better
for facilitating the international cooperation necessary to meet shared
challenges.\" Warren called for a full withdrawal of American troops
from Afghanistan, a policy of never using nuclear weapons first, and
slashing the military\'s budget. \"If more money for the Pentagon could
solve our security challenges, we would have solved them by now,\" she
said. So far, Rhodes doesn\'t see any campaign issue rising to the level
of the Iraq War with either Democratic voters or the presidential
candidates. Neither does longtime Pentagon official Michele Flournoy,
who\'s viewed as a possible future Secretary of Defense the next time a
Democrat wins the White House. [Trump\'s]{.underline} treaty-busting,
alliance-rattling [\"America First\" approach has energized his
supporters.]{.underline} Trump and his base see victory after victory,
as he walks away from the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran nuclear deal
and other international coalitions and agreements. To Flournoy, however,
Trump\'s track record is \"so outside the norm of presidential conduct
on foreign policy that the biggest contrast will be between any
\[general election\] candidate and him, as opposed to between the
\[Democrats\].\" Flournoy is hoping the eventual Democratic winner makes
a pitch along these lines to 2020 voters: \"[America\'s interests and
values are not well-served when we try to go it alone]{.underline} or
impose our will through threats and intimidation. [Our strength is when
we build coalitions and alliances]{.underline} of like-minded states who
share interests, or sometimes values, and we go after problems
together.\"

#### Fopo is intertwined with the economy -- making it a legitimate concern for 2020

**Rogin '19** (Josh, George Washington University BA, "2020 Democrats
must run on foreign policy, not away from it," The Washington Post, May

[The conventional wisdom]{.underline} on presidential elections [is that
foreign policy doesn't play a decisive role]{.underline} --- and most
Democratic presidential candidates have largely avoided it so far. But
[in the 2020 presidential contest, foreign policy will feature more
prominently than ever,]{.underline} and Democrats ignore it at their
peril. In 2016, voters had a clear choice between a traditional foreign
policy leader with tons of experience in Hillary Clinton and a candidate
with no foreign policy experience who promised to radically change the
way U.S. diplomacy was conducted. Although polls showed voters trusted
Clinton more as a commander in chief, she lost the election, and
President Trump has been implementing his new vision for the United
States' role in the world ever since. That's been a mix of what Trump
calls "nationalism": a pivot away from values-based foreign policy
advocacy, an embrace of populism abroad, support for authoritarian
rulers, skepticism of international organizations such as NATO, and
unilateralism in confronting threats such as Iran and the rise of China.
[A new poll]{.underline} this week by the Democratic group National
Security Action [showed that Trump is vulnerable on foreign policy, even
among his own supporters, especially when it comes to trade and
Russia.]{.underline} And yet, [Democratic presidential
candidate]{.underline}s --- with a couple of exceptions --- [have
remained quiet]{.underline} on these issues. [One exception has
been]{.underline} former Maryland congressman John
[Delaney.]{.underline} He has been talking to voters about foreign
policy since becoming the first Democratic candidate to declare his
candidacy in July 2017. [He is convinced it's the most important 2020
issue]{.underline}. "[Foreign policy is the biggest part of the
job]{.underline}. And that's the irony of running for president," he
told me during an interview. Delaney is running as an unabashed
internationalist, centrist, moderate Democrat who believes in returning
to the assertive, values-promoting, alliance-building foreign policy
approach that majorities in both parties once traditionally supported.
This month, he laid out a detailed agenda during a speech at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Advanced and International Studies. The
Center for American Progress released [a study]{.underline} this month
that [showed Democratic voters do care about foreign
policy]{.underline}, [though they want to hear about how it relates to
their security and prosperity]{.underline} --- not about "maintaining
the liberal international order." Delaney argues [foreign policy is more
intertwined than ever with economics and prosperity]{.underline} at
home, and that [Trump has co-opted the legitimate grievances of those
left behind by globalization]{.underline} to advance his unilateralist,
nationalist, populist agenda. But Delaney believes Democratic primary
voters can be persuaded to fix the system rather than blow it up.

### FoPo Not Key

#### Domestic policies will decide 2020. Voters don't care about FoPo. Saudi Arabia only enjoys military backing because voters don't care about it.

Talking About Foreign Policy. They Need to Start.)

[One of the most striking things about the Democratic primary so
far---aside from the sheer number of candidates running---is how little
any of them has said about foreign policy]{.underline}. With very few
exceptions (like one-off essays by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie
Sanders), [the group has ignored the rest of the world and focused on
domestic issues. Such neglect probably shouldn't come as a
surprise.]{.underline} Few of the governors, senators, and mayors now
running for president have international experience to draw on. [And
they know that while American voters do care about foreign policy,
especially when it comes to fighting terrorism and protecting U.S. jobs,
most don't care about it as much as they do about domestic
issues.]{.underline} [Very few U.S. presidents have won office by
building their campaigns around international themes.]{.underline}
[Despite that reality, the fact that even the current candidates who do
have serious foreign-policy chops, like former Vice President Joe Biden,
aren't talking about the subject is a big problem, for two
reasons.]{.underline} The first is that this is a particularly fraught
and dangerous moment for the United States and the world. The
international order seems less steady today than at any other time in
the last 70-odd years. China and (with the U.S. president's inexplicable
acquiescence) Russia are growing ever more sophisticated and aggressive
in their challenges to the United States and its allies. Europe is
leaderless and confounded by Brexit. Cyberattacks and election
interference are proliferating. Americans are still fighting the Taliban
in Afghanistan and terrorist groups (including the Islamic State) around
the world. Populism and other forms of extremism are rising. Deadly,
extreme weather-related catastrophes are growing increasingly common.
And the list goes on and on. The second reason it's a problem that the
candidates are ignoring foreign policy is that many of the threats now
facing the country were caused---or at least intensified---by Washington
itself. For Americans, that thought should be chastening. But it should
also be a source of hope. While the United States has made a number of
big, consequential mistakes in recent years, the good news is that, what
Washington did, it can, in many cases, also undo---or at least work to
remedy. But only if its leaders, and the country as a whole, start
facing up to the issues. To better understand this point---that much of
our current mess is at least partially America's doing, and why that's a
good thing---it helps to break the long list of looming international
challenges into two groups: one structural and the other contingent.
[The structural problems include threats like climate change,
inequality, populism, and the rapid aging of the developed world. These
challenges are the result of slow-moving trends and tectonic shifts that
most of us have long ignored but that are now, finally, demanding our
attention]{.underline}. (It's hard to disregard man-made weather
changes, for example, when your house is flooded or the bees that
usually pollinate your crops have vanished.) Because these threats are
widely distributed---a new study by the United Nations estimates that up
to a million plant and animal species now face extinction---took a long
time to develop, and resulted from broad structural forces, they are
hard for any government to grapple with, especially on its own (though
that doesn't mean they shouldn't try). But the second set of threats now
facing the United States is different. Problems like Russian and Chinese
belligerence, the Islamic State, Afghanistan, the chaos in Libya, or the
havoc being wrecked in Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere by Saudi Arabia and
Iran can all be traced to things the United States has either done or
should have done but didn't. That doesn't mean these problems are all
Washington's fault. But in every case, they've been made worse by
American blunders and, above all, by the perception that the United
States is withdrawing from the world. That perception dates back to the
2008 financial crisis, which took some of the shine off the U.S.
economic model and was interpreted (especially in Beijing) as a sign of
American weakness (never mind that the country has since enjoyed one of
the longest recoveries in history). All of a sudden, the preeminence the
United States had enjoyed since the end of the Cold War---and had
managed to maintain even through disasters like the war in Iraq---didn't
look so stable. Concern intensified during the presidency of Barack
Obama, whose reading of the U.S. public, innate caution, and desire to
avoid doing "stupid shit" led him to pursue a policy of
retrenchment---even when that meant drawing red lines and then failing
to defend them. This record has led to a growing consensus that [the
United States no longer cares much about the world beyond its
borders---or, worse, that it's too weak to do much about it. And things
have gone into overdrive under President Donald Trump, as he has found
ever more creative ways to coddle Russian President Vladimir Putin and
other autocrats while antagonizing and embarrassing U.S. friends and
allies, undermining international institutions, ignoring human rights,
and making it clear he has no interest in helping to resolve conflicts
like the Syrian civil war.]{.underline} First, it has helped convince
leaders in places like Moscow and Beijing that they can do whatever they
want, especially in their own neighborhoods---**think** eastern Ukraine
or the South China Sea---without having to worry that Washington will
try very hard to stop them. Russia's election interference and attempts
to intimidate its neighbors, China's island building, its cyberattacks,
and its campaign to covertly extend its influence in Western countries
with large ethnic Chinese populations---these actions and many others
can all be attributed to the same basic assumption about America's
weakness and its lack of stomach for a fight. Similar assumptions have
also encouraged many traditional U.S. allies to start hedging their bets
by preparing for a world in which they can no longer depend on American
leadership or protection. Such hedging has taken several forms, from the
announcement in March that Italy would join China's world-spanning Belt
and Road Initiative to the decision by the other 11 members of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership to proceed with the trade pact, which Trump
has spurned, on their own. [The final impact **the growing perception of
American indifference has had is to signal to various U.S.
proxies---countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates**,
**which enjoy generous U.S. military backing**---that they can pursue
their own narrow objectives without getting permission from Washington
first,]{.underline} [as they might have done in the past. Among other
things, **that shift explains the catastrophic Saudi and Emirati
intervention in Yemen's civil war**; their support]{.underline} (along
with Egypt) [for the aspiring Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar, who is
now trying to bomb Tripoli into submission; and other ugly little
struggles underwritten by American funds and guns.]{.underline}

[Foreign policy rarely plays a major role in U.S. presidential
elections. The United States has always been an insular nation.
Particularly for people in the American heartland, the world\'s troubles
seem far away.]{.underline} The connectivity of the modern world and the
globalization of terrorism have challenged that insularity, but even so,
[national elections seldom pivot on international affairs.]{.underline}
2020 could be different: Debates over American foreign policy and
national security could sway enough undecided voters to tip the scales,
and the political battle lines are already forming. As Alex Ward pointed
out in Vox, President Donald Trump is likely to sell a story of foreign
policy successes to voters in the upcoming campaign: that he defeated
the Islamic State; stopped North Korean nuclear and missile testing;
repaired U.S. relations with Israel; pushed back on Iran, Venezuela and
Russia; fixed some trade problems; increased U.S. military spending;
compelled some additional defense spending in Europe; and made progress
on an Afghanistan peace process. How will Democrats respond? \"We have
to run on a proactive message of our own,\" a campaign staffer to one
Democratic presidential candidate told Ward, \"instead of spending all
of our time attacking Trump.\" What will that entail? Here are five key
points that the Democratic candidates, and the eventual presidential
nominee, will likely use to dispute Trump\'s narrative. First, the
Democrats will point out that Trump has not resolved any major conflicts
or eradicated any threats, but just kicked the can down the road,
leaving problems for later presidents to deal with. North Korea, for
instance, has paused its weapons testing several times in the past as a
bargaining tool or simply because it didn\'t need to test them.
Everything suggests the current pause is one more instance of that,
rather than a Trump-engineered diplomatic victory. Meanwhile, the
Islamic State has, in fact, lost its territorial \"caliphate\" in Syria
and Iraq, but it is far from defeated. Today it is going underground and
dispersing, biding its time until a later date. It will be back, whether
before the 2020 election or sometime after. Yet Trump has no integrated
counter-ISIS strategy beyond destroying its self-declared caliphate.
Second, the Democrats will condemn Trump for the damage he has done to
America\'s alliances and security partnerships. While the modest
increases in European defense spending are a good thing, NATO is weaker
than it\'s ever been, largely because of Trump\'s continuous political
attacks and disinterest in leading the alliance. As Nicholas Burns and
Douglas Lute, both former U.S. ambassadors to NATO, recently wrote in
The Washington Post, nearly all of the alliance\'s past and present
leaders consider Trump \"NATO\'s most urgent and difficult problem.\" To
counter the growing challenge from China and Russia, Burns and Lute
argue, the United States will need support from NATO, but it may not be
able to count on it under the current political conditions. The
Democratic presidential candidate is certain to echo this warning.
Third, Democrats will point out that while Trump has often criticized
America\'s \"endless wars\" against violent jihadism, he has not ended
them. In both Syria and Afghanistan, Trump cannot decide between walking
away and remaining involved. In Syria, he wants someone else---whether
Arab nations or Europeans---to replace the United States on the ground
to prevent the Islamic State from rebounding, but he has no plan to make
that happen. In Afghanistan, Trump has escalated the air war against the
Taliban to little effect. He has begun a peace process with the Taliban,
but so far there is little reason to believe that it will end the long
conflict in Afghanistan while preserving the democratic government in
Kabul. And, in the broadest sense, Trump has not disavowed what got the
United States embroiled in the endless wars in the first place: the idea
that fighting jihadists in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria or other parts of
the Islamic world somehow diminishes the chances of terrorist attacks in
the United States. Fourth, Democrats will attack Trump\'s coziness with
brutal dictators, particularly his claims of \"friendship\" and \"love\"
for North Korea\'s Kim Jong Un, his persistent refusal to criticize
Russia\'s Vladimir Putin, his closeness with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman, and his praise for Egyptian autocrat Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi,
whom he will host at the White House next week. Although past presidents
have of course dealt with dictators when necessary, they often went out
of their way to explain that the relationship was repugnant but
necessary. Trump, by contrast, shows genuine affinity for friendly
dictators. Rather than grudging toleration, he seems to like them, or at
least feel some sort of kinship with them. Democrats will hammer this
point, arguing that it damages U.S. national interests in the long run
and undercuts America\'s ability to exercise global leadership. Fifth,
Democrats will argue that while Trump stresses the crisis on America\'s
southern border, he has not produced anything close to a comprehensive
strategy to deal with it. In fact, rather than address the root causes
of outmigration in Central America, he recently announced that he was
cutting off economic assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
Outside core Republican voters, few Americans support building a wall on
the southern border---the crown jewel of Trump\'s approach to
immigration. In broad terms, then, the Democratic critique of Trump\'s
foreign policy is likely to be that it promises much but delivers little
and that it is dangerously short-sighted, possibly producing a few near
term \"wins\" but doing long-term damage to American national security.
Barring a major international crisis or an attack on the United States,
foreign [policy won\'t sway the 2020 election. The state of the economy,
health care, questions about presidential character, and the ability of
Trump to convince a strategic majority of Americans that the United
States does, in fact, face a major threat from immigration will instead
determine its outcome]{.underline}. Yet while the Democrats will never
sway Trump\'s loyal base, pointing out the flaws in his foreign policy
might influence undecided voters. This is an admittedly small group in
today\'s hyperpartisan political environment, but it could prove
decisive in a close race.

[A real debate on the arms trade is nearly absent from public
conversation because the industry can only thrive in secrecy and

move as a public official, in which he snuck a provision to curtail

fail to prevent the House from finally passing a resolution to end U.S.
support for the war in Yemen on February 13]{.underline}. Trump has
indicated the Yemen resolution will be his first veto, as it represents
a major check to executive power and a direct rebuke to his arms
export-based style of diplomacy.

#### Even if foreign policy is key- Paris, Iran, INF treaty, and trump ignoring allies all thump the plan

)/MP

[The reaction of the American public to Trump's withdrawal of the United
States from key international agreements has been hosti]{.underline}le.
According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted in early May 2018,
[shortly before Trump announced a pullout from the Iran nuclear
agreement, 54 percent of respondents backed the agreement. Only 29
percent favored a pullout.]{.underline} In July 2018, [when the Chicago
Council on Global Affairs surveyed Americans about their reaction to
Trump's withdrawal from both the Iran deal and the Paris climate
agreement, it found that 66 favored remaining within the Iran accord,
while 68 percent favored remaining within the Paris accord]{.underline}
― an increase of 6 percent in support for each of these agreements over
the preceding year. [Most Americans also rejected Trump's 2019
withdrawal of the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia]{.underline}. A survey that February by
the Chicago Council on Global Affairs reported that [54 percent of
Americans opposed withdrawal from this nuclear arms control treaty and
only 41 percent favored it]{.underline}. Furthermore, when pollsters
presented arguments for and against withdrawal from the treaty to
Americans before asking for their opinion, 66 percent opposed
withdrawal. In addition, despite Trump's sharp criticism of U.S. allies,
most Americans expressed their support for a cooperative relationship
with them. The Chicago Council's July 2018 survey found that [66 percent
of Americans agreed that the United States should make decisions with
its allies, even if it meant that the U.S. government would have to go
along with a policy other than its own. Only 32 percent
disagreed.]{.underline} Similarly, a March 2019 Pew Research poll found
that [54 percent of American respondents wanted the U.S. government to
take into account the interests of its allies, even if that meant
compromising with them, while only 40 percent said the U.S. government
should follow its national interests when its allies strongly
disagreed.]{.underline} Moreover, despite the Trump administration's
attacks upon the United Nations and other international human rights
entities ― including pulling out of the UN Human Rights Council,
withdrawing from UNESCO, defunding UN relief efforts for Palestinians,
and threatening to prosecute the judges of the International Criminal
Court ― public support for international institutions remained strong.
In July 2018, 64 percent of Americans surveyed told the Chicago
Council's pollsters that the United States should be more willing to
make decisions within the framework of the UN, even if that meant going
along with a policy other than its own. This was the highest level of
agreement on this question since 2004, when it was first asked. In
February 2019, 66 percent of U.S. respondents to a Gallup survey
declared that the UN played "a necessary role in the world today." But
what about expanding U.S. military power? Given the Trump
administration's success at fostering a massive military buildup, isn't
there widespread enthusiasm about that? On this point, too, the
administration's priorities are strikingly out of line with the views of
most Americans. A National Opinion Research Center (NORC) survey of U.S.
public opinion, conducted from April through November 2018, found that
only 27 percent of respondents thought that the U.S. government spent
"too little" on the military, while 66 percent thought that it spent
either "too much" or "about the right amount." By contrast, 77 percent
said the government spent "too little" on education, 71 percent said it
spent "too little" on assistance to the poor, and 70 percent said it
spent "too little" on improving and protecting the nation's health. In
February 2019, shortly after Trump indicated he would seek another hefty
spending increase in the U.S. military budget, bringing it to an
unprecedented \$750 billion, only 25 percent of American respondents to
a Gallup poll stated that the U.S. government was spending too little on
the military. Another 73 percent said that the government was spending
too much on it or about the right amount. Moreover, when it comes to
using U.S. military might, Americans seem considerably less hawkish than
the Trump administration. According to a July 2018 survey by the Eurasia
Group Foundation, U.S. respondents ― asked what should be done if "Iran
gets back on track with its nuclear weapons program" ― favored
diplomatic responses over military responses by 80 percent to 12.5
percent. That same month, as the Chicago Council noted, almost three
times as many Americans believed that admiration for the United States
(73 percent) was more important than fear of their country (26 percent)
for achieving U.S. foreign policy goals. Unlike the president, who has
boasted of U.S. weapons sales to other countries, particularly to Saudi
Arabia, Americans are also rather uncomfortable about the U.S. role as
the world's pre-eminent arms dealer. In November 2018, **[58 percent of
Americans surveyed told YouGov that they wanted the U.S. government to
curtail or halt its arms sales to the Saudi Arabian government, while
only 13 percent wanted to maintain or increase such
sales.]{.underline}** Finally, an overwhelming majority of Americans
continues to express its support for nuclear arms control and
disarmament. In the aftermath [of Trump's withdrawal of the United
States from the INF treaty and announcement of plans to build new
nuclear weapons, 87 percent of respondents to a February 2019 poll by
Chicago Council said they wanted the United States and Russia to come to
an agreement to limit nuclear arms.]{.underline} The real question isn't
whether most Americans disagree with Trump's "America First" national
security policy --- they do, in large numbers. The real question is what
they're willing to do about it.

### Public Opposes Arms Sales

#### The public opposes arms sales -- military aid undermines domestic concerns

**Pethiyagoda '19** (Kadira, Fellow at the Brookings Doha Center-

Foreign Policy is Becoming More Popular in Washington," The National
Interest, Jan. 1 2019,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/restrained-foreign-policy-becoming-more-popular-washington-39962)/ly

Donald Trump's pull out of Syria, the Senate's recent vote to end
American support for the Saudi War in Yemen, and Tulsi Gabbard's
announcement that she may run for President in 2020 all suggest [we are
at a pivotal moment in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. The Senate's
historic vote, which reasserted Congress's right to decide on matters of
war, suggests a recognition that [foreign policy is back on the debating
table after decades of being "above politics]{.underline}." Gabbard
constitutes a unique constellation of foreign policy positions, many of
which may bridge the chasm between the views of the public and those of
the political class and mainstream media. Trump himself recognized this
and nodded to his base when he decided to withdraw U.S. troops from
Syria. [Large swathes of the public, on both the left and right, believe
that the foreign policy]{.underline} status quo of incessant
[interventionism has brought little benefit to]{.underline} ordinary
[Americans]{.underline}. A J. Wallin Opinion Research survey revealed
that [71.0 percent of Americans believed Congress should restrain
military action]{.underline}. 86.4 percent felt the military should be
used only as a last resort. Some [**63.9** **percent felt** that
military aid, both money and **weapons, should not be provided to**
regimes like **Saudi Arabia**]{.underline}. Preferences for restraining
military action overseas crossed boundaries of political party and
researchers acknowledged that rarely do issues enjoy such bipartisan
consensus. A study by Boston University (Douglas Kriner) found that
[attitudes against military intervention were running high amongst those
communities which had lost soldiers]{.underline}. Survey Sampling
International revealed similar findings, that [a greater share of
military veterans (often more likely to be Republicans]{.underline}),
[61 percent]{.underline}, [are weary of foreign
intervention]{.underline} than the general public. Sample Survey
International polling found that [79 percent of Americans felt any extra
funding should focus on domestic issues.]{.underline}

#### There's bipartisan opposition to Saudi arms sales- even GOP senators are trying to block sales

[Trump]{.underline} and his advisers [used]{.underline} the emergency
[declaration to bypass a requirement]{.underline} in the Arms Export
Control Act that Congress approve such arms sales [amid growing
opposition]{.underline} by politicians [to providing US precision-guided
weapons to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. The planned sale also provides for
co-production and manufacture of hi-tech bomb components in Saudi Arabia
for the first time. [The vote shows continuing bipartisan political
opposition]{.underline} within Congress to the White House\'s \"business
as usual with Saudi Arabia\" approach. It is unclear if there would be
enough votes to overcome a likely Trump veto of the measure should it
make it to his desk. Senate [Republicans]{.underline}, however, [are
preparing legislation to impose new parameters]{.underline} [on the
US-Saudi]{.underline} strategic [relationship]{.underline}, including
potential financial sanctions on persons involved in the killing of
Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. US legislators have grown increasingly
uncomfortable with the Saudi-UAE aerial bombing campaign in Yemen that
has caused thousands of deaths and a severe cholera outbreak. \"What\'s
happening in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has been exacerbated
by the very weapons we have been giving the Saudis,\" Menendez said.

According to a new YouGov survey, [most Americans oppose U.S. support
for the war on Yemen: A majority of Americans oppose US support for the
ongoing Saudi-led war in Yemen, with 58 percent of respondents in a
recent survey wanting lawmakers to curtail or halt the supplying of arms
for a conflict considered the world's worst ongoing humanitarian
disaster. Only 13 percent of Americans say they want to lawmakers
maintain or increase arms sales to]{.underline} [the US allies in the
conflict, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates]{.underline},
according to the survey conducted by the polling firm YouGov and
commissioned by the relief group International Rescue Committee. There
has been no regular polling of public opinion in any country about the
war on Yemen, and this is the first poll I can recall seeing that asked
Americans about U.S. support for the war. It is a measure of how little
coverage the war has received that there have been virtually no polls
commissioned to find out what the public thinks about it. The results
from this survey are encouraging, and it shows that [most Americans
reject the policy when they are made aware of what their government has
been doing to back the war on Yemen]{.underline}. Americans that have an
opinion on the subject are overwhelmingly against U.S. policy: Among
those who had an opinion on the conflict, the survey found [75 percent
of Americans oppose US involvement in the war.]{.underline} If there
were consistent, regular coverage of the conflict and U.S. involvement
in it, I would like to think that opposition would be even greater.
[U.S. backing for the war has been indefensible from the start, and it
is telling that there is virtually no positive public support for what
the government has been doing without Congressional authorization for
more than three and a half years.]{.underline}

### Base

#### Base turnout key to Trump victory in 2020- he can't convert swing voters

**Adams 6/28/19**

Myra Adams - RCP Contributor, Real Clear Politics, How GOP Insiders View
Trump\'s \'Base-Only\' 2020 Strategy,
https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/06/28/how_gop_insiders_view_trumps_base-only_2020_strategy.html

I was intrigued and confounded by the president's bravado when
supposedly he is running for president of the United States, not
president of His United Base. In a country so polarized that the middle
has virtually disappeared, shouldn't Trump at least pretend to reach out
to swing voters? He could even position that effort as a patriotic move
for the well-being of the nation. My strategic advice would be to try a
little unification instead of division. But since his "Whole Life Is a
Bet," [Trump is betting that his base will carry him to
victory]{.underline} and to heck with the rest of America. Perplexed by
this strategy, I reached out to some well-known Republican presidential
consultants and gleaned fascinating insights and perspectives. [Agreeing
with Trump's base strategy is]{.underline} Alex Castellanos, who is
frequently seen on broadcast and cable TV screens. Castellanos worked on
the presidential campaigns of Bob Dole, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, and
Mitt Romney. He is a co-founder of Purple Strategies, a bipartisan
communications firm. Castellanos offered [two points:
First]{.underline}, "Donald **[Trump's base is much bigger than it
appears on surveys]{.underline}**. If you haven't figured out [its
uncool to tell the polling/media establishment you are a Trump
supporter, you are not smart enough to be one. So add 5 to 6 points to
every survey you see]{.underline}." Second, "[Trump doesn't have to win
over swing voters. He just has to make sure they see he is the only
thing standing between them and the return of a rapacious D.C.
establishment]{.underline}. Swing voters may find this President hard to
swallow personally, but the country is on fire. He's the only fireman in
town and Democrats are kerosene." Such a vivid, poignant description of
the political environment is why Castellanos is a sought-after TV
analyst. Next up is Mark McKinnon, who was the chief media strategist
for George W. Bush's campaign in 2004, the last Republican president to
be re-elected. He is currently co-producer and co-host of "The Circus,"
Showtime's hit political documentary series, now in its fourth season,
and a commentator on several cable news channels. Here is McKinnon's
response to Trump's "base only, no need for swing voters" strategy:
"[It's a risky strategy]{.underline} because in order to be successful,
it means the campaign has to suppress turnout with Democrats to a level
at or lower than it was in 2016. And given what we saw in 2018,
Democratic turnout is likely to be significantly higher." Actually, it's
more than likely, according to Ronald Brownstein in a June 13 piece in
The Atlantic headlined \"Brace for a Voter-Turnout Tsunami\" and
sub-headlined "Even with a surge in overall participation, white
working-class voters could still remain decisive in the 2020 election."
McKinnon, in line with Brownstein's analysis, said: "**[On the other
hand, \[the base\] may be Trump's only possible route to victory. If he
can't convert any Democrats or Independents, which a lot of polling
suggests, then he'll have to rev up his base into a 100 percent turnout
frenzy]{.underline}** and make the Democratic nominee the greatest
threat to democracy and keeping America great since, well, Hillary
Clinton."

#### Trump is losing now, but foreign policy wins shift perception of his presidency

Trump, The Atlantic,

Few could have predicted that President Donald [Trump]{.underline} would
be this good at surrendering the political advantage of a strong
economy. Not only [is]{.underline} he now [underwater in the three
states that pushed him to victory in 2016]{.underline}---he's now
unexpectedly vulnerable in places such as Texas, Florida, and Ohio as
well. His popularity rises to 50 percent or higher in states that total
a mere 102 electoral votes. Probably of more concern to his campaign:
[He's fallen below 40 percent approval in states encompassing a
201-electoral-vote bloc. **But Democrats haven't won the 2020 election
yet---and we've got a long way to go**]{.underline}. [At this stage
in]{.underline} the 19[92]{.underline} election cycle, President George
H. W. [Bush was riding high]{.underline}, buoyed by America's success in
the Gulf War. Less than two years later, Bill Clinton moved into the
White House. [Trump might]{.underline} [prove]{.underline}
[incapable]{.underline} [of]{.underline} engineering such [a dramatic
reversal]{.underline} of fortune. **[But if the economy continues to hum
and he racks up a couple of wins on foreign policy, the public's
perception of his presidency could shift. Democrats can't bank on voters
being more dismayed by him than they are enamored of us.]{.underline}**
For that reason, Democrats need to take a strategic approach to the next
20 months. In the last election, [Democrats were too quick to dismiss
the possibility that voters would take Trump "seriously]{.underline},
not literally." This time, [we should]{.underline} not only [take him
seriously]{.underline}---we should take him literally when he tells us
exactly how he's going to run his reelection campaign.

[[Democrats hoping for a **united front** against]{.underline}]{.mark}
President Donald [[Trump in]{.underline} **[2020]{.underline}** [are
trying to **avoid splintering** over a]{.underline}]{.mark}[n
increasingly **[thorny topic]{.mark}**: the **[Israeli-Palestinian
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With an energized progressive base
increasingly supportive of Palestinian rights, and a president who is
stridently pro-Israel in his policy moves, Democrats are starting to
grapple more than ever with the party's once-reflexive support for
Israel. The 2020 [**[Dem]{.mark}ocratic** presidential [**contenders**
are **saying little publicly**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as they
**balance**]{.mark} the **[competing interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
But in the meantime, pro-Israel Democrats are scrambling behind the
scenes to shore up support, providing Holy Land trips to members of
Congress and proposing policies they hope can bridge a growing party
divide. Against this backdrop, Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota
--- one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress ---
apologized on Monday for what many regarded as anti-Semitic criticisms
she leveled on Twitter. The controversy, coupled with the substance of
the overall policy debate, has concerned Democratic consultants as much
as it encourages [[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} who
[[hope]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Trump's support of Israel will allow
them to **peel off Jewish voters**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[a **key
Dem**]{.mark}**ocratic [constituency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "What you
have emerging are at least two Democratic views of Israel and a
Republican view," said Aaron David Miller, who has advised several
presidential administrations on the Middle East conflict. "[[The]{.mark}
**real [question]{.mark}** to me [is to **what degree**]{.mark} [the
**progressive view** is going to]{.mark} influence and or [**shape** the
**mainstream**]{.mark} of the **[Dem]{.mark}ocratic
[Party]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Among the questions faced by the party
and its growing list of Democratic presidential candidates: Should the
United States move its embassy from Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv? Should
the Democratic Party platform use the word "occupation" to describe
lands claimed by Palestinians? Is the pro-Palestinian "boycott,
divestment and sanctions" movement an acceptable form of protest against
Israel? That last issue, nicknamed "BDS," has laid bare the divisions
among Democrats. Of at least seven U.S. senators running or considering
vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, six of them --- Cory
Booker, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders
and Elizabeth Warren --- recently voted against a measure from Florida
Republican Sen. Marco Rubio that would allow state and local governments
to not do business with companies that support boycotting, sanctioning
and divesting from Israel. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar --- who has
declared she is running for the White House --- voted with the majority
when the legislation passed, 77-23, last week. Klobuchar is known for
her strong support of Israel and had a rabbi at the launch of her
presidential campaign this past weekend. In total, Democrats accounted
for 22 of the "no" votes and 25 of the "yes" votes on the overall
package, which also included other measures related to the Middle East.
Middle East watchers say that a decade ago, the anti-BDS aspect would
have garnered almost no opposition. The anti-BDS piece of the package
may not survive the Democratic-controlled U.S. House, where Omar and
fellow Muslim American Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have
emerged as outspoken supporters of Palestinian rights. The caucus's
freshman sensation, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has also
tweeted remarks perceived as more sympathetic to Palestinians than
Israel. Booker of New Jersey made perhaps the biggest pivot; last year,
he co-sponsored a similar bill aimed at undermining the boycott
movement. But he voted against the recent measure that moved in the
Senate. Like many of his potential 2020 Democratic rivals, Booker
explained his vote on grounds that the measure could threaten people's
First Amendment rights. "There are ways to combat BDS without
compromising free speech, and this bill as it currently stands plainly
misses the mark," Booker said in a statement. Nonetheless, Republicans
are using the measure to paint Democrats as weak on Israel, and the vote
has added to the unease among pro-Israel groups such as the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. Warren also faced critical
coverage over Israel recently when The Jerusalem Post noted that she
failed to push back on the description of Israel as "an apartheid state"
during a question-and-answer moment in New Hampshire. The critical tenor
of that question underscores the drift of the Democratic Party over the
years. According to a Pew Research poll last year, 79 percent of
Republicans sympathize more with Israel than the Palestinians but only
27 percent of Democrats feel that way. The poll also found that
Republicans' support for Israel over Palestinians had increased by 29
percentage points since 2001, while Democratic support of Israel over
Palestinians declined by 11 points in that same timespan. Still, a
Mellman Group poll taken just before the elections last year found that
68 percent of Jewish voters identify as Democrats, while 25 percent
identify as Republicans. And, compared to the population overall, 76
percent of Jewish voters held an unfavorable view of Trump --- even
though he was the first U.S. president to honor a longstanding
commitment to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. But
[**[Trump]{.mark}** also [**angered** many in the **Jewish
community**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[when he failed to]{.mark} clearly
[denounce neo-Nazis]{.mark}]{.underline} after the violent 2017 clashes
in Charlottesville, Va., and for running a campaign supported by white
nationalists. [**[Still]{.underline}**, [the **pro-Palestinian
drift**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the party [has **increasingly
worried**]{.mark} some **[Dem]{.mark}ocratic
[activists]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That fear is **[especially]{.mark}
pronounced** [in **Florida**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[home
to]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[a large **Jewish
population**]{.underline}]{.mark} and Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.
[**[Florida]{.mark}** also [is the]{.mark} nation's **[largest swing
state]{.mark}** that's [**central** to **Trump's re-election**]{.mark}
**hopes**]{.underline}. "As far as that type of rhetoric from Omar and
some of the debate driving Jewish people from the party, [there is a
definite risk if leadership doesn't reject the promotion of]{.underline}
BDS and [anti-Semitism]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Evan
[Ross]{.underline}, an AIPAC member and [Democratic activist from
Miami-Dade, Florida's **most populous county**]{.underline}. Ross noted
that the Democrats' nominee for governor in 2018, Andrew
**[[Gillum]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[took heat from]{.underline}]{.mark}
Republican Ron [[DeSantis over]{.mark} the [BDS]{.mark}
issue]{.underline}. [[When DeSantis narrowly won]{.underline}]{.mark}
the governor's mansion, even some [[Democrats cited]{.mark} his
[**pro-Israel platform** as a **reason for**]{.mark} **the
[victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "As a Republican, what's happening in
the Democratic Party is great politically for us. But it's awful for the
Jewish community and anyone who cares about the issues we care about,"
said Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
"This is going to come to a head in the Democratic Party," he said.
"They're trying to keep a lid on this but they can't." The shifting
views of Israel among Democrats are in part the result of years of
lobbying by activists concerned about Palestinian rights. But the ascent
of a hard-right government in Israel has accelerated the trend, making
support for the country less reflexively bipartisan. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's seeming disrespect toward former President
Barack Obama upset many in the party, especially its African-American
members. Many black Democrats skipped Netanyahu's March 3, 2015, speech
to Congress --- in which he urged lawmakers to vote against the nuclear
deal Obama negotiated with Iran. Democratic pro-Israel activists have
stepped up lobbying since Democrats recaptured the House last November.
In January, for instance, a group of national security experts, some of
whom may join Democratic campaigns, visited Israel to get a lay of the
political landscape, meeting with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
The weeklong trip was organized by J Street, the left-leaning pro-Israel
group that has battled for primacy with the more conservative and
established AIPAC. Also last month, a new pro-Israel organization popped
up in Washington. The Democratic Majority for Israel, led by several
veteran Democrats, aims to combat the waning enthusiasm for Israel among
progressives. The group says that it will focus its "education and
advocacy efforts first around the 2020 presidential and congressional
elections." Critics are casting the group as an unofficial offshoot of
AIPAC, but its founders insist that is not the case. \"The Democratic
Majority for Israel is a wholly independent organization that exists to
promote Democratic values, including a strong U.S.-Israel
relationship,\" said Mark Mellman, the group\'s president. A big
Democratic concern: how to handle the issue of the U.S. embassy in
Jerusalem? Trump moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv over
Palestinian objections. The Trump administration also has moved to
downgrade the status of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem, the
diplomatic mission that dealt directly with the Palestinians, who did
not want to go through an embassy linked to Israel. One campaign
platform proposal being floated among Democratic consultants is to keep
the embassy in Jerusalem but reestablish a diplomatic mission ---
possibly something beyond just a consulate general --- in a part of East
Jerusalem that Palestinians claim for a future capital. "There are
discussions taking place about how to recognize the Palestinians'
connection to the East Jerusalem, to rebalance the ledger after Trump's
attempt to take the issue of Jerusalem off the table," said Dylan
Williams of J Street. But more left-leaning activists say that may not
be enough. "They should move the embassy back," said Yousef Munayyer,
executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights. "They
should bring U.S. policy in line with international law, which was
really what the embassy's move subverted. That is the least that needs
to happen." [For the most part]{.underline}, the numerous [[Democrats
considering a **White House run** have not]{.mark} fully [fleshed out
their foreign policy]{.mark} ideas]{.underline}, [[much less]{.mark}
their [**exact views** on **Israel**]{.mark} **and the
Palestinians**]{.underline}. Democratic activists say they expect a more
intense fight than usual over the Democratic Party platform, especially
on how it describes the plight of the Palestinians and whether it uses
the term "occupation." Supporters of Sanders, the independent senator
from Vermont eyeing a second run for the Democratic nomination, are
expected to push for a mention of "occupation." Sanders' side lost that
same battle, and the nomination, when he ran in 2016. More moderate 2020
candidates or those aligned more closely with Israel are likely to argue
against language such as "occupation" on grounds that it could offend
Israelis, who prefer terms like "contested" or "disputed" and in some
cases question any Palestinian claim to the territories. Democratic
activists stress that the 2020 election is still a political lifetime
away, but acknowledge that when it comes to Israel, Republicans are far
more united in offering uncritical support. "The more contentious fight
is going to be among Democrats," said one Democratic strategist not yet
affiliated with any campaign. "Our job is to mend the rifts here." That
being said, there's a strong belief that no matter who wins the
Democratic primary, the party will unite behind them regardless of their
stand on Israel. After all, for Democrats, the election is about Trump,
said Miller, the Middle East expert. "[[**If the** Democratic]{.mark}
Party's prime **[directive is defeating]{.mark}**]{.underline} Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said, "then various elements of
[[the party]{.underline}]{.mark} would or [[**should** **go to some
lengths** to **ensure**]{.mark} that [**no issue drives a wedge**,
**least of all**]{.mark} the issue of **[Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

#### Florida's a must win for Trump and he's losing it now

https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/11/14/florida_exit_polls_reveal_tough_2020_fight_for_trump_138644.html\]

This debacle is in effect the first major political battle of the 2020
cycle. Discussed below are exit poll highlights from the Senate and
gubernatorial race illustrating why **[[Florida
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** now, [[and will **continue to be**, the
**Mother of All Swing States**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But first, for
context, let's establish the four candidates who are engaged in this
ferocious recount. The Republican U.S. Senate candidate is term-limited
incumbent Gov. Rick Scott, who leads three-term incumbent Democratic
Sen. Bill Nelson with 0.2 percent of the vote. Leading in the race for
governor by 0.4 percentage points is former three-term Republican
Congressman Ron DeSantis, a Trump acolyte. His opponent is Tallahassee
Mayor Andrew Gillum, running to be Florida's first African-American
governor and a Bernie Sanders wannabe. Before the midterms there were
countless reports that Republican candidates across the nation were in
danger of "losing" white college-educated women voters, a key bellwether
demographic. So how did the Sunshine State fare with these highly
engaged voters? The answer is "crash and burn." [[When **compared to
Trump's support** in 2016]{.mark}, both [**Scott and DeSantis** **shed
18**]{.mark} percentage [**points'** worth of **college-educated white
women**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to 2016 exit polls, [Trump won
60 percent of these wome]{.underline}n, while [Scott and DeSantis won
only 42 percent]{.underline}. [[That trend **spells disaster** for the
**GOP in 2020**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conversely (and noteworthy) [in
2016, only 37 percent of white college-educated Florida women voted for
Hillary Clinton]{.underline}. But in 2018, Nelson won 58 percent of this
politically active demographic while [[Gillum won]{.mark} **57
percent**]{.underline}, [[a **20-point increase**]{.underline} [in just
**two years**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Another ominous sign for Florida
Republicans revealed in last week's midterm was that college-educated
white women comprised only 13 percent of the electorate, down from 18
percent in 2016. But in 2020 --- especially if Democrats nominate a
candidate who energizes this bloc and manages to increase their
electoral percentage back up to 18 percent or more --- President [[Trump
will have **difficulty maintaining** the **1.2 percent** margin of
**victory** with which he won the state in 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Another interesting Florida midterm data point is that [**women**
constituted **55 percent** of the]{.mark} total [electorate compared to
45 percent for men]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} 10-point
[**gender gap** is **up four**]{.mark} percentage **[points from
2016]{.mark}**]{.underline} when women bested men by only six points ---
53 percent to 47 percent. [[**Democrats** Nelson and Gillum **won
women** by **double digits**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but both narrowly
lost their races (we think \-- stayed tuned). Nelson won women by 56
percent to 43 percent over Scott, and women supported Gillum over
DeSantis by essentially the same margin, 55 percent to 43 percent. So
how did Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis eke out the slimmest of victories?
The answer is men, men, men. (Hat tip to the late Tim Russert, the
originator of the now iconic phrase "Florida, Florida, Florida" --- his
prediction that the state would determine the winner of the 2000
presidential election.) With men, Scott trounced Nelson by 16 points, 58
percent to 42 percent. DeSantis performed even better, winning men by 17
points, 58 percent to 41 percent. Therefore, in 2020 President Trump
will be looking to Scott and DeSantis for help in turning out Florida's
men because both candidates increased Trump's 52 percent winning margin
among this group in 2016 by four points. The last Florida midterm
demographic that needs discussing is race. Gillum, as an African
American, aimed a spotlight on this data point, and race was a
contentious issue during the campaign against DeSantis. First, let's
compare the white vs. non-white vote from 2016 to 2018. In 2016, the
white vote comprised 62 percent of Florida's electorate and the
non-white vote, 38 percent. In 2018 the white electorate increased by
four percentage points to 66 percent while the non-white vote decreased
by the same amount to 34 percent. Both Scott and DeSantis won exactly 60
percent of the white vote. Gillum attracted 39 percent of white voters.
Surprisingly, he won only 68 percent of the total non-white vote ---
winning 86 percent of the black vote and 54 percent of the Latino vote.
Meanwhile, DeSantis won 30 percent of the total non-white vote with help
from 14 percent of blacks and 44 percent of Latinos. (Florida's unique
Cuban vote, which tilts Republican, was obviously a major factor.) For
the record, blacks comprised 13 percent of the state's midterm
electorate, and Latinos were 15 percent. In the Senate race, Nelson won
70 percent of the non-white vote compared to only 29 percent for Scott.
Nelson won a whopping 90 percent of the black vote, four points higher
than Gillum's share in the governor's race. Go figure. Gov. Scott did
poorly with blacks, winning only 10 percent of their vote but still two
percentage points higher than Trump in 2016. What must be disappointing
to Scott --- who heavily courted the Latino vote in his Senate campaign
--- is losing that growing demographic to Nelson by nine points, 54
percent to 45 percent. What do these exit poll highlights mean going
forward? Answer: Strap yourself in for 2020, both in Florida and
nationally. Given that the midterm race for governor and senator are in
recount mode with lawsuits aplenty and accusations of impropriety being
hurled, [[one can only imagine]{.mark} what [Florida's]{.mark} state of
[anxiety]{.mark} will be [leading up to]{.mark} Election Day [**2020**
when]{.mark} President [**Trump frantically defends** his
**must-win**]{.mark} adopted home **[state]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Pro-Israel groups overwhelmingly support Democrats now, but that's slightly wavering -- the plan cements a trend that puts Trump over the top in every swing state. Networks of donors magnify the link

Dating back to 1990, [[**pro-Israel groups** have **given more** to
**Democratic candidates** than Republicans in **every election
cycle**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conservative groups are laying the
groundwork to reverse this longstanding trend. [The [Republican Jewish
Coalition]{.mark}]{.underline} (RJC), backed by conservative megadonor
Sheldon Adelson, reportedly plans to spend \$10 million in the 2020
elections to garner support for President Donald Trump from pro-Israel
Jewish voters. That kind of spending would lead to an eye-opening
increase for RJC, which contributed \$496,097 to Republican candidates
and made \$1.7 million in independent expenditures to aid Republicans in
2018. During the group's annual summit last weekend, RJC board member
Ari Fleischer told Politico that the group [[hopes to make]{.mark}
additional [**inroads** with **large Jewish populations** in
**Florida**]{.mark}, **[Ohio]{.mark}**, [**Pennsylvania** and
**Michigan** to **put Trump "over the top."**]{.mark}]{.underline} The
optimism from RJC comes as [[Republican groups continue attempts to
capitalize on controversial comments]{.mark} from]{.underline} Rep.
Ilhan [Omar]{.underline} (D-Minn.). [[They're]{.mark} also [**trying to
make inroads** with pro-Israel **Jewish voters** by **supporting Trump's
controversial decisions** to **recognize Golan Heights** as **Israeli
territory** and move the]{.mark} U.S. [Embassy]{.mark} to
Jerusalem]{.underline}. The push comes as Trump reportedly emboldens
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vow to annex parts of the
West Bank. [The majority of money from pro-Israel groups currently goes
toward Democratic candidates]{.underline}, [but substantial [new
investment into the RJC]{.mark} from Adelson [**could amount** to a
**seismic shift** in]{.mark} the realm of **[pro-Israel
groups]{.mark}**]{.underline}. J Street, a liberal advocacy group which
supports a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, has remained

went to Democrats. The PAC functions as a conduit for donors who want to
support J Street-endorsed candidates. Donors earmark their contribution
toward a specific candidate, then J Street's PAC distributes the money
to the candidate. With this process, individual contribution limits
remain in place, but candidates can take in large sums through J
Street's supporters. Combining direct PAC contributions and itemized
earmarked contributions, J Street's top two beneficiaries were Wisconsin
Democrats Dan Kohl (\$228,983) and Tammy Baldwin (\$206,705). Also
acting as a conduit for its supporters, NorPAC was the second-highest
spender, shelling out \$1.1 million. The group is nonpartisan,
committing to candidates of both parties that "demonstrate a genuine
commitment to the strength, security, and survival of Israel." But 63
percent of the money went to Democrats. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)
received \$205,519 in itemized contributions through the New
Jersey-based group, more than any other candidate. Though the
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) doesn't make direct
contributions to candidates, its "Congressional Club" program
incentivizes American members to contribute thousands toward pro-Israel
congressional candidates. It's difficult to decipher how much AIPAC
members contribute toward candidates as they often don't specify they
are contributing as required by the program. Each of the Democratic
Presidential candidates declined to speak at AIPAC's annual conference,
drawing criticism from Republicans. AIPAC recently targeted Sen. Bernie
Sanders (I-Vt.) with Facebook ads urging its supporters to tell Sanders
that "America stands with Israel." Still, several high-profile
Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer, spoke at the AIPAC conference. "I stand with
Israel, proudly and unapologetically," Majority Leader Steny Hoyer
(D-Md.) said at the conference. "When someone accuses American
supporters of dual loyalty I say, accuse me." [[There are **some

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tariniparti/donald-trumps-newest-way-to-divide-democrats-israel\]

**[[Ahead of his 2020 reelection]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[Trump has
been looking to **take advantage** of]{.mark} any [**cracks** within the
**Democratic Party**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the last few months ---
including in his State of the Union speech --- Trump has latched onto a
broad portrayal of all Democrats as socialists swho were out of step
with the economic views of the country, bringing up progressive
firebrand New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's policy priorities as
though they were held by all Democrats.

And in recent weeks, as [[Democrats have continued to deal with
**shifting views** toward **Israel** within **their own
party**]{.underline}]{.mark}, following comments made by Omar,
[**[Trump]{.mark}** is employing the same tactic: He has **[attacked the
party]{.mark}** broadly [as "**anti-Jewish**]{.mark}" in his comments
and tweets, [while taking steps to bolster his pro-Israel image to
**draw**]{.mark} a **[contrast]{.mark}** whenever possible]{.underline}.

"The Democrats have very much proven to be anti-Israel," Trump told
reporters Friday. "There's no question about that. And it's a disgrace.
I mean, I don't know what's happened to them. But they are totally
anti-Israel. Frankly, I think they're anti-Jewish."

During Netanyahu's visit --- weeks before the Israeli leader under
corruption charges faces a tough election --- Trump signed a
proclamation with a key political priority for Netanyahu: recognizing
Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategically located
area along Israel's northern border that has been long disputed. The
move is seen as a major reversal in long-held US foreign policy and a
political gift to Netanyahu.

"We're celebrating the Golan Heights," Trump said Monday. "It's
something that I've been hearing about for many years, from many people.
I've been studying for years. And this should have been done, I would
say, numerous presidents ago. But for some reason, they didn't do it,
and I'm very honored to have done it."

Trump has repeatedly spoken about his decision to move the US Embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a similar way at campaign rallies and
official events. So much so that, in a speech at Trump's Florida club
Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, Sen. Lindsey Graham reportedly brought up
Trump's decision to move the embassy with a joke: "There will be a Trump
hotel \[in Jerusalem\] in 10 years."

Trump was expected to spend more than an hour with Netanyahu on Monday
and join him for dinner Tuesday night, but Netanyahu, who was also
supposed to address the AIPAC conference, had to cut his trip short
after a rocket hit central Israel.

Republicans have repeatedly pointed out that none of the 2020 Democratic
contenders were scheduled to speak at the AIPAC conference. Presidential
candidates, however, typically are only invited to address the
conference in election years.

Trump did not address the conference himself. But while he was
emphasizing his cozy relationship with Netanyahu at the White House,
Vice President Mike Pence spoke at AIPAC on his behalf, calling the
president "the greatest friend of the Jewish people and the State of
Israel ever to sit in the Oval Office of the White House."

[[Pence]{.underline}]{.mark} used the opportunity not just to draw
attention to the president's Golan Heights proclamation, but he also
[[carried the president's message, **stressing**]{.mark} the [**emerging
divisions** within the **opposing party on
Israel**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"It's astonishing to think that the party of Harry Truman, which did so
much to help create the State of Israel, has been co-opted by people who
promote rank, anti-Semitic rhetoric, and work to undermine the broad
American consensus of support for Israel," Pence said, adding falsely
that the "party that has been the home of so many American Jews \...
struggled to muster the votes to unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism in
a resolution."

[[**House Democrats** were **united** in a]{.mark} recent [vote for a
**resolution condemning anti-Semitism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, among
other racist behavior. Twenty-three Republicans voted against the
measure.

WASHINGTON---Recent provocative [[comments by]{.underline}]{.mark}
freshman congresswoman Ilhan **[[Omar]{.underline}]{.mark}**, D-Minn.,
[[illustrate a **growing divide** in the **Democratic Party**
over]{.mark} the **[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The current dust-up escalated Sunday after House Minority Leader Kevin
McCarthy, R-Calif., said Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should be
disciplined for making anti-Israeli statements. Omar and Tlaib, who are
Muslim, support the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement
that seeks to punish Israel economically for its treatment of
Palestinians in the country.

On Sunday night, Omar tweeted that lawmakers' support for Israel is "all
about the Benjamins baby," meaning money. When a journalist asked who
she thought was paying lawmakers to support Israel, Omar tweeted,
"AIPAC!" a reference to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a
pro-Israel lobbying group.

In 2018, AIPAC spent approximately \$3.5 million on lobbying, according
to the nonprofit, nonpartisan research group Open Secrets. AIPAC also
annually pays for congressional lawmakers to take trips to Israel. It
does not have its own political action committee and does not contribute
directly to campaigns, though individuals who worked for AIPAC donated
\$21,350 to candidates in 2018. Nine of 14 candidates that received
contributions were Democrats.

After Omar's tweets, Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Elaine Luria,
D-Va., both Jewish, circulated a letter asking the Democratic Party to
condemn anti-Semitism from "certain members within our caucus." House
Democratic leadership released a statement Monday, affirming, "We are
and will always be strong supporters of Israel in Congress. ...
Congresswoman Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial
accusations against Israel's supporters are deeply offensive. We condemn
these remarks and call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately
apologize."

Omar tweeted an apology. But it was not the first time she made waves
with anti-Israel comments. She only recently apologized for a 2012 tweet
in which she said, "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken
the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel." House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said that Omar will not lose her spot on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee over her remarks.

A growing coalition of Democratic lawmakers has [[**pro-Palestine

[The latest 2020 election fault line between Republicans and Democrats,
and to a degree among Democratic presidential candidates, is Benjamin
Netanyahu.]{.underline} At least five of the Democratic presidential
candidates, ranging from the Israel-critical to the AIPAC-aligned, have
rebuked the Israeli prime minister just days ahead of his re-election
bid on Tuesday after he pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the West
Bank. Beto O'Rourke went so far as to call Netanyahu racist. "The
U.S.-Israel relationship is one of the most important relationships we
have on the planet," O'Rourke said while campaigning in Iowa this
weekend, "and that relationship, if it is successful, must transcend
partisanship in the United States, and it must be able to transcend a
prime minister who is racist." Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders also
criticized Netanyahu's annexation pledge while claiming it doesn't make
them anti-Israel. [President Donald Trump, meantime, held up his
friendship with Netanyahu as a reason that Jewish voters should leave
their traditional Democratic Party home.]{.underline} Democratic
presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke speaks in New York City at the
National Action Network's annual convention, April 3, 2019. (Drew
Angerer/Getty Images) Netanyahu has also raised liberal ire recently by
embracing several authoritarian leaders from other countries and
retreating from support for a two-state solution. Many liberals believe
his efforts to push Trump to recognize Israeli sovereignty in the Golan
Heights have also harmed the Middle East peace process. [How the
Democrats treat Netanyahu is indicative of the emerging Israel fault
line within their party between progressives who have become
increasingly bold in denouncing the Israeli leader and his hawkish
policies and moderates who do not want to give President Donald Trump
any help in his bid to depict Democrats as anti-Israel.]{.underline}
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., campaigning in Nevada, a key caucus state,
told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that she was unhappy with Netanyahu's
West Bank announcement but also emphasized her pro-Israel credentials.
"I'm for the two-state solution and I don't favor what Netanyahu did
this weekend," she said. "I don't favor the annexation; I think we
should have a two-state solution." An older man interrupted her meeting
with local Democratic activists in suburban Las Vegas on Sunday, saying
"Israel oppresses Palestinians." But Klobuchar cut him off, saying
"We've talked about that." Klobuchar's impatience with the activist
underscored the difficulties moderate Democrats may face in handling the
party's progressive base, which has grown increasingly hostile to
Netanyahu, a villain for the Democratic left at least since 2015 when he
worked behind the scenes with Republicans to speak in Congress against
President Barack Obama's Iran nuclear deal. MoveOn, the progressive
advocacy group, called on [Democratic presidential candidates to boycott
last month's American Israel Public Affairs Committee
conference]{.underline}, in part because Netanyahu was a featured
speaker. Klobuchar, perhaps the Democratic candidate closest to AIPAC,
met with a delegation from the Israel lobby that came to her office
during the conference. "I met with my local AIPAC group, I was proud to
do that, and I was proud to be a strong supporter of Israel, my voting
record has shown that," she said. Sen. Amy Klobuchar campaigns for the
Democratic presidential nomination in Independence, Iowa, March 16,

at the annual conference of the Republican Jewish Coalition, played up
his relationship with Netanyahu, noting how the prime minister stood at
his side as Trump signed the proclamation recognizing the Golan as
Israel's sovereign territory.

disgrace, I mean, I don't know what's happened to them but they are
totally anti-Israel. Frankly, I think they're anti-Jewish."]{.underline}
The comments come after a growing number of Democratic hopefuls for the
party\'s 2020 presidential nomination said they will not attend the
annual policy conference put on by the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC), an influential pro-Israel lobbying group. Thus far
the campaigns of eight Democratic presidential candidates have confirmed
to ABC News that they will not be attending the conference, which is
slated to begin this Sunday in Washington, D.C., and runs through
Tuesday. Those not attending the conference include: Sens. Bernie
Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, former Texas Rep. Beto
O\'Rourke, Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee, former Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Julián Castro, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend,
Indiana and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney. Representatives for the
campaigns of Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar did
not respond to ABC News when asked if they will be attending AIPAC.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during the 2016
AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, March 21, 2016. Even as a growing
number of Dermocratic candidates declined to appear, other top
Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader
Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, are all slated to
attend and speak at this year\'s conference. \"Sen. Sanders has no plans
to attend the AIPAC conference. He's concerned about the platform AIPAC
is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a
two-state solution,\" Sanders\' Policy Director Josh Orton wrote in a
statement provided to ABC News. Sanders, who is Jewish, did not attend
the conference in 2016 either, while his then-rival for the Democratic
nomination, Hillary Clinton, attended the gathering and gave remarks. A
spokesman for Delaney said the candidate is \"very disappointed,\" he
can not attend the conference due to a scheduling conflict. [The
decisions come after prominent liberal group MoveOn.org called on all
Democratic candidates vying for the party\'s presidential nomination to
boycott the conference. \"It's no secret that AIPAC has worked to hinder
diplomatic efforts like the Iran deal, is undermining Palestinian
self-determination, and inviting figures actively involved in human
rights violations to its stage,\" Iram Ali, Campaign Director at
MoveOn.org, wrote in a statement released earlier this
week.]{.underline} The call to boycott the conference also comes after
Democrats struggled to respond to the backlash against Minnesota Rep.
Ilhan Omar, whose comments about Jewish Americans and dual-loyalty
sparked a debate within the party about anti-Semitism led the U.S. House
to pass an official resolution condemning \"hate.\" Despite the
backlash, many prominent Democrats including Sanders and Harris came to
Omar\'s defense.

That ground-up surge in [pro-Palestine activity was visible in the
recent midterms that led to the election of at least two vocal
supporters of the boycott]{.underline}, divestment and sanctions
movement aimed at pressuring Israel into addressing Palestinian rights:
Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. The first
Palestinian-American elected to Congress, Tlaib did not respond to OZY's
requests for comment but has previously told The Intercept that she
wants to lead a delegation to Palestine that would counter the annual
AIPAC-sponsored trip to Israel. "There is [a young generation of
American progressives overall who are looking for a rejection of the
old]{.underline} way of doing things," says Simone Zimmerman, a
spokeswoman for If Not Now, a Jewish-American activist group building
public support to end Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. The
former Sanders staffer ties the pro-Palestine movement's work to the way
the Vermont senator was able to normalize progressive ideals such as
Medicare-for-all. "Just like how we're seeing young people push for
radical new visions, like the Green New Deal policy" supported by
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Zimmerman adds. But the rise of this sentiment
is also likely to make Israel --- of the countless issues that are
likely to be faced by the 2020 candidates --- perhaps the most divisive
within the Democratic caucus. Once hot-button issues such as gay
marriage, a carbon tax and Medicare-for-all have become nearly
ubiquitous party positions. [American Jews are particularly sensitive
toward anti-Semitism as hate acts and White nationalism have risen since
the 2016 election]{.underline}, most visibly during the Pittsburgh
synagogue shooting in October that left 11 dead. "In this national
environment, candidates have to be very careful as to where the line is
in denouncing Israel," says Tyler Gregory, CEO of Wider Bridge, a
progressive LGBT organization focused on advocating for Israel.
"Deflecting and blaming critics of Israel for that is very cynical,"
responds If Not Now's Zimmerman. But there may be ramifications past the
primary, should candidates not toe the traditional line. [It looks
**unlikely** the Jewish vote would switch en masse to Donald Trump in
the 2020 presidential race. But in a swing state like Florida,
particularly if a pro-Palestine presidential candidate becomes the
Democratic nominee? "The difference between carrying the Jewish vote
75-25 and carrying it 55-45 could, in theory, be the difference in the
election," Johnson says.]{.underline}

While it's difficult to pin down what motivates the policy decisions of
individual members of Congress, [it's relevant to consider the strong
influence that AIPAC has over Congress]{.underline}, which Omar did in a
follow-up tweet. The congresswoman from Minnesota, who came to the U.S.
in 1995 as a Somali refugee, did not allege that AIPAC is the only
pro-Israel organization seeking to influence American politicians'
actions regarding Israel. It is, however, one of the most powerful.
[Does AIPAC directly pay members of Congress to vote for "pro-Israel"
policies]{.underline}, something Omar alleged and Forward opinion editor
Batya Ungar-Sargon challenged on Twitter? The short answer is "no," but
[the nuanced answer is far more complicated.]{.underline} Here's how
AIPAC spends money to influence American politics. Donations from AIPAC
Members [AIPAC]{.underline} is not a political action committee and does
not donate directly to political candidates, but it [requires its
members to donate to the campaigns of certain members of Congress in
order to receive exclusive membership benefits.]{.underline} Doug
Rossinow, an academic and author of a forthcoming book on American
Zionism, wrote in the Washington Post that [since the late 1970s, AIPAC
"has informally directed substantial campaign contributions toward
chosen candidates for Congress."]{.underline} The New Yorker explained
AIPAC's role in the late 1980s establishing allied pro-Israel PACs,
which often had AIPAC leaders in charge and "looked to \[AIPAC\] for
direction" regarding campaign contributions. AIPAC, which has generally
been allied with the Republican Party, reportedly recruited individual
bundlers, who would collect AIPAC members' donations to direct them to
the campaigns of senators and representatives. "[The goal was to develop
people who could get a member of Congress on the phone at a moment's
notice," wrote the New Yorker's Connie Bruck.]{.underline} On its
website, AIPAC details its "Congressional Club," a group of members who
commit to donate at least \$5,000 per election cycle "in a clearly
pro-Israel context" to "pro-Israel politics." "The Congressional Club is
designed to recognize politically active members of AIPAC who support
pro-Israel candidates for the House and Senate," the group says. The
influence of [AIPAC]{.underline} and other pro-Israel organizations
[impacts]{.underline} one of Washington's biggest special-interest
groups: [the defense industry]{.underline}. As Sludge previously
reported, both defense and pro-Israel interests have donated significant
amounts of money to the campaign of Engel, whose committee has
jurisdiction of arms exports. The top U.S. weapons manufacturers benefit
from Israeli weapons purchases, made possible in part by American
financial assistance.

the Arab world's poorest nation to the brink of widespread famine as

to U.S. involvement in the 5-year civil war in Yemen. This war has
created one of the biggest humanitarian crises in the world of our time,
with thousands of children dead in the middle of a cholera epidemic and
famine. [Supported by a Democratic Party united in Congress, and an
anti-interventionist faction of the Republican Party headed by Senators
Rand Paul and Mike Lee of Utah, the War Powers resolution had passed
both houses of Congress. But 24 hours after Sanders urged the President
to sign it, Trump vetoed the resolution, describing it as a "dangerous
attempt to undermine my constitutional authority."]{.underline}
According to journalist Buchanan J. Buchanan, "with enough Republican
votes in both chambers to resist Trump's veto, this could have been the
end of the matter; but it wasn't. In fact, [Trump gave the Democrats his
them for peace by 2020."]{.underline} If Sanders emerged as the nominee,
[we would have an election with a Democrat running with the catchphrase
"no more wars" that Trump had promoted in 2016. Thus, Trump would be
defending the bombing of Yemeni rebels and civilians by Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} In 2008[, John
McCain]{.underline}, hawk leader in the Senate, [was defeated
by]{.underline} the progressive Illinois Senator Barack [Obama, who had
won his nomination by defeating]{.underline} the bellicose Hillary
[Clinton who had voted for authorizing the war in Iraq.]{.underline} In
2012, the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, who was much more
aggressive than Obama in his approach to Russia lost. However, in 2016,
[Trump presented himself as]{.underline} a different kind of Republican,
an opponent of the Iraq war, [an anti-interventionist,]{.underline} and
[promising to get]{.underline} along with Russian Vladimir Putin and
getting [out of the Middle East wars. None of the main candidates for
the 2020 Democratic nomination --- Joe Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris,
Beto O'Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker-- seems as
aggressive as Trump has become.]{.underline} Trump pulled the United
States out of the nuclear agreement with Iran, negotiated by Secretary
of State John Kerry, and re-imposed severe sanctions against the
Iranians. He declared the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran a
terrorist organization, to which Tehran responded with the same action
against the U.S. Central Command. Trump has recognized Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel, moved the U.S. embassy there, closed the consulate
that was in charge of Palestinian affairs, cut off aid to Palestinians,
recognized the annexation by Israel of the Golan Heights snatched from
Syria in 1967 and kept silent about Netanyahu's threat to annex the
Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Trump has spoken of getting all
U.S. troops out of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. However, they are still
there. Although Sanders supports Israel, he says he is looking for a
two-state solution, and criticizes Netanyahu's regime. Trump came to
power promising to get along with Moscow, but he sent Javelin anti-tank
missiles to Ukraine and announced the US withdrawal of the 1987 Treaty
of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) subscribed by Ronald Reagan,
who banned all ground-based nuclear intermediate range missiles. When
Putin sent a hundred Russian soldiers to Venezuela to repair the S-400
anti-aircraft and anti-missile system that was damaged in the recent
blackouts, Trump provocatively ordered the Russians to "get out" of the
Bolivarian and Chavista country. According to Buchanan, the gravity
center of U.S. policy is shifting towards Trump's position in 2016. And
[the anti-interventionist wing of the Republican Party is growing. The
anti-interventionist wing of the Republican Party together with the
anti-war wing of the Democratic Party in Congress are capable --- as
they were War Powers Act resolution on Yemen-- to produce a new
bipartisan majority. Buchanan predicts that in the 2020 primaries,
foreign policy will be in the center and the Democratic Party would have
captured the ground with the catchphrase "no more wars" that candidate
Donald Trump exploited in 2016.]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia and the war in yemen is the key deciding factor for 2020. Democratic nominees are already centralizing fopo on their platform. The plan makes Trump look good

**Cooper 18** (Ryan Cooper is a national correspondent at TheWeek.com.
His work has appeared in the Washington Monthly, The New Republic, and
the Washington Post 12-3-19 (Will foreign policy matter for the
Democrats in 2020?)
<https://theweek.com/articles/810188/foreign-policy-matter-democrats-2020>
)/MP

[In the 2004 and 2008 Democratic primaries, **foreign policy was
probably the most important topic of discussion**]{.underline}. [Since
then, the subject has largely fallen by the wayside]{.underline}, as the
population has stopped paying attention to the war in Afghanistan, and
the dozens of other overseas interventions have been small enough (at
least in terms of American casualties) to be easily overlooked.
[However, this may change in 2020.]{.underline} Unlike in 2012, the
economy is (fingers crossed) doing okay[. And unlike in 2016, **there is
a major foreign policy question to draw everyone\'s attention** ---
namely, how Trump has justified **Saudi Arabia\'s butchering of a legal
America resident, and how he has enabled an accelerating genocide in
Yemen**. It raises the question: Will the next Democratic nominee
develop an alternative foreign policy to the neocon-lite imperialism
that has dominated the party for over a decade?]{.underline} Let\'s
review some history. In 2004, the Democrats nominated John Kerry, a
critic of the Iraq War who also voted for it. In 2008, they nominated
Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton specifically because he did not
support the war, but he proceeded to put Clinton in charge of the State
Department and went on to conduct a foreign policy that only looks
peaceable when compared to that of his predecessor, George W. Bush.
[Obama did push through the nuclear deal with Iran, but he also
unleashed aggressive drone strikes, including the assassination of
American citizens (including a 16-year-old boy) without any due process,
and backed the Saudi war in Yemen for its first two years]{.underline}.
[In the 2016 primary, Clinton\'s leftist challenger Bernie Sanders was
palpably rusty on foreign policy at first, allowing one of his strongest
angles of attack against her to lay fallow for months]{.underline}. She
won, of course, making her probably the most belligerent Democratic
nominee since Lyndon Johnson. However, Sanders has considerably upped
his game since then. During the campaign, he rapidly fleshed out a
pretty solid foreign policy framework, and afterwards snapped up some
key staffers. He\'s since delivered two major speeches, one outlining a
basic foreign policy framework for the United States, and one advocating
for a new progressive internationalism (with some help from former Greek
Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis). The idea clearly is to position
Sanders as the candidate of peace, restraint, and calm international
relations for 2020. [**Elizabeth Warren, also positioning herself for
2020,** has lately been trying to claim a bit of that ground herself.
**In a big speech last week, she outlined a foreign policy** that would
overhaul the broken international trade regime, wind down the war in
Afghanistan, and stand up to the alliance of corrupt right-wing
authoritarians]{.underline}. It\'s a bit of a change of tune for Warren,
who used to sound very Clinton-esque on issues like Israel, and voted
for Trump\'s defense bill last year, but on the whole it was a solid
speech. [**That brings me back to Yemen, Trump, and Saudi Arabia**. The
striking thing about the president\'s overt justification of the Saudis
butchering American resident and Washington Post journalist Jamal
Khashoggi is how perfectly it encapsulates the false picture of American
\"interests\" that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decades. After
detailing the supposed huge investments Saudi Arabia is making in the
U.S., and how they\'re keeping oil cheap, Trump insists that \"America
is pursuing its national interests.\"]{.underline} Of course, Trump
exaggerated the scope of Saudi investment by at least a factor of 30.
But as Greg Sargent and Matt Yglesias argue, even aside from that
hyperbole, his argument is an absolute crock. Just on a very cynical
oil-for-alliance understanding of American interests, cheap Saudi
gasoline is not so good when the president looks the other way when the
failson dictator of that country murders American residents. Red-blooded
patriots can\'t enjoy their Cadillac Escalades when they\'ve been
deposited in several different trash cans around Riyadh. By a less
cynical but more realistic view, cheap oil is bad because it harms
American oil producers --- who actually pump out more barrels than Saudi
Arabia these days. By an even less cynical but more realistic still
view, cheap oil is bad because it fuels climate change, which is going
to severely harm the United States if it isn\'t stopped. And on purely
moral grounds (which certainly is related to the national interest, if
indirectly), murder is wrong. [Something similar is true for the
genocidal **Saudi war in Yemen. T**his conflict, which has already
killed tens of thousands of people and is could kill millions more
through famine and disease, is a strategic disaster for the U.S. Helping
Saudi wedding- and schoolchildren-bombers with targeting and
logistics]{.underline} (American forces were helping refuel them as well
until recently, but they reportedly don\'t need that anymore), [deeply
implicates the United States with the worst humanitarian catastrophe in
decades.]{.underline} It grossly harms our reputation, stokes furious
hatred in the hearts of millions --- oh, and Saudi Arabia is literally
arming and paying al Qaeda as part of the effort --- and for what? So a
couple hundred defense contractors can have a third Jacuzzi in their
McLean McMansions, and a couple hundred Saudi lickspittles at various
suborned D.C. \"think tanks\" and lobbying shops can continue to collect
their blood money salaries? No matter how you define it, that is not in
the same galaxy as the national interest. **T[he question for
2020]{.underline}** [is whether this will be much of a point of
contention. Indeed, the **Yemen** disaster is so bad that Sanders teamed
up with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) to push through a bill ending all U.S.
involvement in the conflict, which recently passed
overwhelmingly.]{.underline} Still, the liberal imperialist wing of the
Democratic Party is strong, which is probably why even Sanders and
Warren have yet to lay out a really stark moral case for imperial
rollback. But [if Trump continues to enable the Yemen conflict,
i]{.underline}t [may turn out that McGovern-style anti-imperialist
politics will make a comeback. In **any case, would-be 2020 contenders
would be wise to develop a sensible, moral foreign policy
platform**]{.underline}.

#### Americans hate US involvement in Yemen. Ending sales is critical to change voter's perception of trump.

[A majority of Americans oppose the US government's support for the
ongoing Saudi-led war in Yemen, a survey has shown. Some 58 per cent of
respondents wanted lawmakers to curtail or halt the supply of arms for a
conflict considered the world's worst ongoing humanitarian disaster.
Only 13 per cent of Americans said they want lawmakers to maintain or
increase arms sales to the US allies in the conflict -- Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.]{.underline} But the survey, conducted by
YouGov and commissioned by the International Rescue Committee relief
group, also showed striking nationwide ignorance about the conflict. The
three-year conflict in Yemen has been largely ignored by broadcast media
in favour of near 24-hour coverage of President Donald Trump's foibles.
The war has claimed tens of thousands of lives and brought the Arab
world's poorest nation to the brink of widespread famine as winter
approaches and heating and cooking fuel prices spike, according to
relief organisations. But of 1,000 Americans surveyed earlier this
month, a third said they had never even heard of the Yemen war. [Among
those who had an opinion on the conflict, 75 per cent opposed US
involvement]{.underline}. "We've already made the argument that this
conflict is morally and strategically bankrupt,\" said Amanda Catanzano,
a senior director at the International Rescue Committee. \"[But it's
also politically unpopular. It doesn't reflect the perspective of the
American people]{.underline}.\" The conflict has recently become a focus
of policymakers in the west. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi last month,
at the hands Saudi agents tied to the office of Crown Prince Muhammad
bin Salman, has sparked a debate about Riyadh's increasingly erratic
leadership. Prince Salman, as defence minister, intervened in Yemen in
2015 after Houthi rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, and strengthened
what had been a loose alliance with Iran. Canada, Germany, Denmark, and
Finland have already announced new restrictions on arms exports to Saudi
Arabia and the UAE. The US, UK, and France have resisted such action. On
Monday, a coalition of charities including Oxfam and Save the Children
issued a joint statement demanding an ceasefire, the reopening of ports
to humanitarian and commercial goods, and for authorities to resume
paying the salaries of civil servants. The coalition said: "If the
government of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Ansar Allah, and other
parties to the conflict fail to take these steps, and if the United
States does not use all levers of pressure to compel them to do so,
responsibility for the deaths of many more Yemeni civilians will lie not
only with the parties to the conflict, but with the United States as
well." US secretary of defence James Mattis has called for a ceasefire
in Yemen by the end of November ahead of peace talks in Sweden next
month, and a number of US lawmakers have spoken out against American
involvement in the conflict, but the war rages on. \"Rather than halting
the fighting we've seen continued intense clashes,\" said Ms Catanzano.
"We are anticipating some debate on Capitol Hill in the coming days
about future of US support for Saudi and UAE coalition. If the
administration isn\'t ready to move on it, we hope Congress can give it
the time and attention and debate it deserves." In general, the war at
the southern edge of the Arabian peninsula has received scant coverage
in the US press. Of those contacted in the latest survey, 58 per cent
said they did not know the US sells arms and provides intelligence to
the Saudi-led coalition and 64 per cent did not know about civilian
casualties. Nearly 30 per cent said they had no opinion on the conflict.
Asked if US involvement in the Yemen war advanced American interests, 42
per cent said they did not know. The survey [found 82 per cent want
congress to restrict weapons transfers and more than half want an end to
all arms sales.]{.underline}

[With Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman embarking on a nearly
three-week road show across the United States, he will have one major
hurdle: Americans don\'t like his country very much.]{.underline}
Despite a 75-year economic and military alliance with Saudi Arabia and
regular royal visits, **[55 percent of Americans have an unfavorable
view of the kingdom]{.underline}**, according to a Gallup poll in
February. [Even longtime U.S. adversaries like China and Cuba have
scored more favorably.]{.underline} Crown Prince Mohammed is expected to
be welcomed as a reformer when President Trump greets him at the White
House on Tuesday. The 32-year-old prince recently expanded women\'s
rights. This summer the kingdom lifts its ban on women driving. Women
are also allowed to enter the military for the first time and can attend
sporting and cultural events. He\'s reined in the religious police who
enforced strict rules of public behavior. Public cinemas will be
licenses for the first time in decades. But he\'s also raised concerns
with brazen power moves that include detaining more than 300
businessmen, former ministers and high-ranking royals in a five-star
hotel in the capital Riyadh. The Gulf nation\'s leaders described the
wave of arrests in November 2017 as an anti-corruption purge, but for
many international investors, it seemed more like a shakedown, as
wealthy Saudi businessmen were pressured to negotiate secret settlements
and hand over billions to get released or face public trials and
personal ruin. [Crown Prince Mohammed has a backer in the White House.
President Trump tweeted his approval of the anti-corruption campaign
within hours of the arrests in Riyadh.]{.underline} \"[I have great
confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, they know exactly what they are doing\....\" the
president tweeted. After the White House visit, the crown prince\'s
schedule includes meetings in Silicon Valley, in Los Angeles with
entertainment executives, oil industry leaders in Houston, captains of
finance in New York and high-profile media interviews along the way.
[The busy itinerary appears to be a charm offensive to reset American
public opinion and woo U.S. investors.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia has a
story to sell: a young, dynamic crown prince who claims to be
dramatically reforming the kingdom. He will tell a skeptical American
business community that Saudi Arabia is safe for investments and even
open for tourism for the first time. The Saudi and U.S. economies are
significantly linked by \"investment ties, energy markets, and a shared
interest in the stability of the global economy,\" writes Karen Young, a
resident scholar at Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. For one,
Saudi Arabia is the biggest international buyer of U.S. weapons. It will
be an uphill battle, says Frank Wisner, a retired U.S. diplomat and
businessman. \"[It\'s not an easy country to like]{.underline},\" Wisner
says. \"[The American mind simply rebels at the way Saudi women are
treated, the way they execute criminals, the enforced religious
doctrin]{.underline}e,\" he says. There are other issues that follow the
prince to the United States. [Members of Congress are urging the U.S. to
stop supporting the Saudi war in Yemen, which has triggered a
humanitarian crisis in the country.]{.underline} For all the claims of
reform, the prince hasn\'t talked about free speech or elected
leadership. Dissident clerics and critics of the latest reforms have
been jailed. But the issues that color American public opinion come
closer to home. \"It goes back to the 1980s, they \[the Saudis\] were
perceived using their oil wealth to rip off Americans,\" explains Gerald
Feierstein, director of Gulf affairs at the Middle East Institute in
Washington and a former ambassador to Yemen. \"I see from the coverage
that Saudi Arabia is a country that many liberal Americans \... \[and\]
many liberal Westerners love to hate.\" says Bernard Haykel, professor
of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University. There have been serious
low points in the relationship, like when Saudi Arabia imposed an oil
embargo against the United states in the 1970s in retaliation for
America\'s military support for Israel. More recently, last December,
Saudi King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud condemned President Trump\'s
recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital. Worst of all for some
Americans, the Sept. 11 attacks still cast a long shadow over Saudi
Arabia because 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. \"[There are
still lots of people who look at the Saudis and think
9/11]{.underline},\" says F. Gregory Gause, a professor of international
affairs at Texas A&M. \"Either they were behind it, for which there is
no evidence, or they created the conditions.\" For a long time there
have been two things you could count on in relations between the United
States and Saudi Arabia. [The country has been favored by American
Presidents. But it\'s unpopular with the American people.]{.underline}

[President Donald Trump is heading into the 2020 election with a pretty
solid foreign policy success story to sell American voters --- and
Democrats are struggling (but working) to come up with a coherent
message to counter it.]{.underline} In just two years in office, Trump
has achieved several big foreign policy wins: ISIS's caliphate has been
completely defeated. North Korea hasn't tested a nuclear bomb or
ballistic missile since 2017. The US defense budget has grown to
historically high levels. And Mexico and Canada have agreed to a new,
updated version of NAFTA that includes better protections for American
workers. And while there are certainly major caveats to all of those
"successes" --- and some serious foreign policy challenges, like the
trade war with China, conspicuously left off the list --- on paper at
least, it's a pretty strong record for Trump's first term in office.
Which means that [Democratic candidates looking to unseat Trump in 2020
will face a stiff challenge crafting a compelling
counternarrative]{.underline}. Of the more than 20 Democratic candidates
in the race so far, only [Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie
Sanders (I-VT) have presented anything like comprehensive foreign policy
platforms. Both candidates have outlined visions that focus on the broad
goals of championing democracy abroad and building economic strength at
home]{.underline} but offer few specifics on major issues like North
Korea, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and curbing the rise of China.
And the remaining candidates' [foreign policies remain largely unknown
or undeveloped at this stage in the contest. In the absence of a clear,
persuasive counternarrative to Trump's foreign policy success story,
policy experts have been trying to fill the gap, writing articles and
convening panels trying to help define what a progressive foreign policy
platform might look like.]{.underline} And on May 10, National Security
Action --- a nonprofit policy organization led by top former Obama
administration officials Ben Rhodes and Jake Sullivan --- will hold a
conference in Washington featuring top lawmakers, former government
officials, and leading experts to coalesce around a shared progressive
foreign policy vision. The conference, which has not previously been
reported, will include both establishment heavy hitters like former
Obama National Security Adviser Tom Donilon and former Obama White House
Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, as well as rising Democratic stars like
Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA).
Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Obama
White House, told me there's a reason for the event and the upswell in
activity. [Progressives feel "Trump's foreign policy represents a
profound emergency for the country,]{.underline}" he said, "and so
[there needs to be better coordination among them to push back against
what Trump is doing around the world]{.underline}." It's a Herculean
task. [The Democratic Party is a big tent, and the party's left flank is
increasingly out of step with more centrist Democrats who have espoused
traditional US foreign policy positions for decades. And progressives
have historically stumbled when trying to present a viable foreign
policy alternative to the more military- and security-focused
conservatives on the right.]{.underline} But Rhodes, Sullivan, and their
allies are on a mission to correct this deficiency once and for all ---
[first, by defining what a progressive foreign policy even is, and
second, by finding a way to sell that affirmative vision of America's
role in the world to voters in 2020.]{.underline}

promise to shield U.S. farmers from the economic pain of an intensified
trade war with China indicates he's ready to dig in on his demands for a
deal, a stance that threatens an important part of his political
base.]{.underline} Trump said on Twitter Friday that the U.S. would use
revenue from tariffs to buy the output from America's farms "in larger
amounts than China ever did," even though the administration has yet to
dole out all of the \$12 billion in aid set aside last year after
Beijing slapped retaliatory duties on agricultural products in the first
round of the trade war. The president said the government-purchased farm
goods would get shipped "to poor & starving countries in the form of
humanitarian assistance." But he gave no details on how such a program
would be administered. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who is in
Japan for talks, said in a tweet that the president "directed \@USDA to
work on a plan quickly." The U.S. ramped up tariffs on \$200 billion in
goods from China Friday and threatened to put duties on more Chinese
imports if the two countries can't reach a deal in the coming weeks.
[China has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, and
the agricultural industry was bracing for another hit.]{.underline}
More: China Trade War Poised to Weigh on U.S. Economic Growth "[You know
the retaliation is going to focus on rural areas because that's his
base]{.underline}," Wallace Tyner, an agricultural economist at Purdue
University in West Lafayette, Indiana, said in a telephone interview
Friday. "[That's how these trade wars work, the other country always
focuses on the adversary's political base."]{.underline} China had made
good faith purchases of soybeans as negotiations appeared to progress,
Tyner said, but that may cease "if we don't get a deal and Trump says 'I
don't care how many months it takes.'\" In that case "agriculture is
going to continue to bear the brunt," he said. [Farm country voted
solidly for Trump in 2016 and rural areas of the U.S. have been a
backbone for his Republican Party. But residents there are already
reeling. Net farm income is projected to total \$69.43 billion this
year, down some 44 percent from 2013 levels, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Expenses have increased in recent years and
they're saddled with record debt.]{.underline} Roger Johnson, president
of the National Farmers Union, [the second-biggest U.S. general farm
group, expressed concern with Trump's tweet about buying up farm
products.]{.underline} "That's a very different thing than assistance to
farmers," Johnson said. He said dumping supplies in other countries
could further depress prices and also jeopardize those fragile largely
agrarian economies. Joseph Glauber, former chief economist at USDA, said
corn and soybeans are typically animal feed and not food aid, which
usually consists of wheat and rice. Such a move also would also invite
further trade disputes, since they would likely be judged export
subsidies prohibited by WTO, if they weren't seen as humanitarian aid,
Glauber said. "You can't just dump grain at concessional prices. That
would constitute an export subsidy. That is something the WTO members
agreed not to do," Glauber said. In the 2017 fiscal year, the Agency for
International Development gave 3.12 million tons of foreign food aid
valued at \$3.62 billion, according to government figures. Still,
Trump's political allies, and even some critics, are standing behind him
in the confrontation with China. 'Line in the Sand' GOP Representative
Tom Cole of Oklahoma said he fully supported the president's stance even
though the trade war was hurting businesses and farmers in his district.
\"This is a line in the sand that needed to be drawn a long time ago,
I'm proud he's doing it and he deserves our support,\" said Cole, who
predicted most Republicans would back the president. Representative Brad
Sherman of California, a longtime hawk on China trade, was among the
Democrats who said he's pleasantly surprised by Trump staying tough on
China. He backed the idea of substantial tariffs and spending it on farm
and other products impacted by Chinese retaliation. \"Of all the Trump
policies, if I had to cheer one, this would be it,\" he said.
\"President after president has done nothing.\" Farmers 'Extremely
Concerned' There is some grumbling among agricultural groups, however.
The National Corn Growers Association, the National Association of Wheat
Growers and the American Soybean Association released a joint statement
Friday saying that "[farmers across the country are extremely concerned
by the actions taken today by President Trump and his
administration."]{.underline} Ethanol, a source of domestic income for
corn farmers, also faces steep tariffs from China, drying up exports to
one of its largest buyers. "[It's just one hit after the next for our
industry and the rural economy. We will continue pressing the
administration to reopen these critical markets,]{.underline}" said
Chris Bliley, vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, an
ethanol industry trade group. Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable
Fuels Association, expressed similar concerns. "[News of the worsening
trade conflict with China is yet another punch in the gut to the U.S.
ethanol industry and our partners in agriculture," Cooper said. "The
escalating trade war just exacerbates the turmoil in our markets and
pushes rural America closer to the precipice."]{.underline} Johnson, the
National Farmers Union president, said that Trump still retains the
support of farmers despite the financial pressures on them. "[There's
still a lot of them that support, but they're still hurting," Johnson
said. "The bottom line is they're going broke and they're going broke
fast."]{.underline}

[Punishing tariffs ordered by President Trump are set to go into place
Friday on Chinese goods, escalating a high-stakes battle with major
risks for the economy and his reelection.]{.underline} GOP lawmakers
have been pressuring Trump to get a deal with China that would lower
tariffs hurting U.S. farmers and manufacturers, but their complaints
have failed to move the president or yield progress in talks with
Beijing. After months of touting progress toward a final deal, Trump is
set to take a different tack on Friday, when tariffs on \$200 billion in
Chinese imports will rise from 10 percent to 25 percent, a move Trump
said is necessary to hold China to previous commitments. "We were
getting very close to a deal, then they started to renegotiate the
deal," Trump told reporters Thursday. "We can't have that." Republicans
have been broadly in favor of Trump's crackdown on China's alleged theft
of U.S. intellectual property, market manipulation and other trade
barriers. [But some GOP lawmakers are growing impatient and frustrated
by the steep toll of Trump's trade war, more than a year after the
president called such conflicts "good and easy to win." Those
frustrations are most acute in farm states that have borne the brunt of
China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods, and that poses a
risk to Trump's reelection strategy, particularly in Midwestern
states.]{.underline} \"A lot of farmers have said to me, it\'s hurting
us temporarily. But the president\'s doing the right thing because you
can\'t let the Chinese screw us on international trade,\" said Sen.
Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in a Tuesday interview with NPR after the
forthcoming tariffs were announced. \"So it\'s time, I think, to strike
a very strong, enforceable deal so that farmers, even nonfarmers, can
get the certainty that they need,\" Grassley added. Several Republican
senators warned Vice President Pence in a Tuesday lunch that [Trump's
inability to close trade deals with China, along with Canada and Mexico,
is hurting rural economies.]{.underline} "We always take it first in
agriculture," said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee[. "There's a lot of feeling in farm country that
we're being used as pawns in this whole business." Beijing has pledged
to retaliate]{.underline} if Trump follows through with Friday's tariff
hike [and could increase or expand import taxes on U.S.
crops.]{.underline} American farmers have been hit with huge losses from
previous tariffs in the trade war, and further import taxes on their
China-bound goods could compound the harm of plunging commodity prices
and falling foreign orders. "The president\'s got the right fight going
on," said Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), ranking member on the House
Agriculture Committee. \"My only advice to the president and \[U.S.
Trade Representative Robert\] Lighthizer and others is, get this done as
quickly as you can because we\'ve got real Americans suffering daily.\"
[Trump has downplayed the potential harm from Friday's
escalation.]{.underline} "Whatever happens, don't worry about it. It
will all work out," Trump said at Wednesday rally in Florida. "You know
why? It always does." Trump's power play on China comes as he enjoys the
highest approval rating of his presidency and a booming economy, two
factors that could give him leverage in the trade war. Washington's
battle with Beijing is also more popular in industrial states like Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that swung the 2016 election to
Trump. Those states are key to his reelection strategy. [While Democrats
broadly agree with Trump's critiques of China, he's unlikely to receive
support from the party amid the mounting costs of the trade war. Failed
trade negotiations will give 2020 candidates an opening to tarnish the
president's economic record and deal-making ability.]{.underline} Rep.
Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a 2020 presidential candidate, said he shares Trump's
concerns with Chinese trade policy, but criticized the president's
"dangerous" lack of strategy. "It roils the markets, it doesn\'t provide
stability and he\'s got no plan. So I\'m not going to support this,"
said Ryan, whose district includes the former General Motors plant in
Lordstown. "You\'re with him one day, you think maybe he\'s saying
something that makes sense, and then a day later he changes his mind so
he can break into the news cycle,\" Ryan added. Stephen Myrow, managing
partner at Beacon Policy Advisors in Washington, said Thursday that
[Trump's aggressive stance toward China reflects the split in Trump's
base between industrial states with Democratic roots and deep-red
agricultural states.]{.underline} "If you look at the states that he
cares most about in the election, these are places where beating up on
China plays well," Myrow said. "There's a difference between the Farm
Belt and the Rust Belt," he said. ["The Farm Belt ends up feeling the
pain of the trade war the most because it's easy for China to hit back
against our commodities."]{.underline} Raising tariffs on China also
threatens to slow economic growth through higher prices on thousands of
consumer goods and manufacturing parts. "[That would no doubt trigger
retaliation, which has already taken a toll on everything from farming
to manufacturing]{.underline}," wrote Diane Swonk, chief economist at
Grant Thornton, in a Wednesday research note. The trade conflict, she
said, poses "mind boggling and growing" threats to the U.S. economy.

#### Trump's tough on China approach is backfiring -- loses him his base and the 2020 election.

[Trump tests the patience of his political allies in his approach to
trade and tariffs]{.underline} By DON LEE, NOAH BIERMAN and JENNIFER
HABERKORN MAY 14, 2019 \| 6:10 PM \| WASHINGTON Trump tests the patience
of his political allies in his approach to trade and tariffs President
Trump speaks during a campaign appearance at Dubuque Regional Airport in
Iowa. (Paul Sancya / Associated Press) With a growing economy at his
back and little resistance from Republicans, President Trump has been
free to impose tariffs on America's trading partners with few political
repercussions. [Yet his protectionist approach --- particularly his
heavy-handed tactics with China]{.underline}, as well as with
traditional allies Canada and the European Union --- [presents a
high-stakes gamble for him and other Republicans in the 2020
elections.]{.underline} So far the president has been able to keep
skeptical Republicans from rebelling by stoking his voting base and
promising to subsidize soybean farmers and others hit hard by the trade
conflict with China. And Trump has bipartisan support in Congress to try
to compel Beijing to change or halt policies that many in Washington see
as endangering U.S. economic and security interests. But with new tariff
deadlines looming as early as Saturday, [the president is testing the
patience of some of his staunchest allies in Congress, many of whom have
long billed themselves as opponents of trade barriers and skeptics of
government subsidies meant to alter the market.]{.underline} Although
Trump portrays tariffs as something paid by foreign countries --- and
seems to believe it --- Republican elected officials generally accept
the evidence that [U.S. consumers bear most of the cost of higher taxes
on imported goods.]{.underline} "[We are growing tired and frustrated of
hearing the up-and-down, back-and-forth of everything as it relates to
China]{.underline}," said Scott Henry, a third-generation Iowa farmer
and spokesman for Farmers for Free Trade, a nonprofit advocacy group.
"We just want to see something get done." Unlike Trump, who recently
called tariffs "the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our
country," many Republican lawmakers see them as a tool to be used
briefly if at all. "I completely agree with what President Trump is
trying to do --- get China to abide by the rules --- but this is
high-stakes poker and I hope we win," said Sen. Ron Johnson, a
Republican from [Wisconsin, which depends heavily on farming and
manufacturing industries that could see significant impacts from
tariffs.]{.underline} A quick resolution appeared unlikely after talks
broke down Friday and Trump hiked tariffs on \$200 billion of imported
goods on China. Beijing retaliated on Monday by vowing to increase
tariffs on \$60 billion of American-made goods as of June 1. [At least
in public, neither side showed signs of backing down]{.underline}
Tuesday. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump threatened
to slap tariffs on all remaining Chinese imported goods, or another
\$300 billion, in what he called a "little squabble." In Beijing,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, "China will fight to the
finish." Analysts say Chinese President Xi Jinping will never agree to
certain enforceable changes that the U.S. side wants, including giving
up subsidies to state-owned firms that are fundamental to China's
government-controlled economic and political system. [That leaves Trump
with a painful choice]{.underline}, said William Reinsch, a veteran
trade analyst in Washington and senior advisor at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan think tank. He can
accept "a weaker agreement than he wants, in which case the Democrats
will attack him for being soft and caving," Reinsch said. Or [he can
leave tariffs in place indefinitely, causing higher prices for American
consumers, and "Democrats will accuse him of being an incompetent
negotiator, a bad closer and somebody who caused an enormous amount of
short-term pain for what turned out to be no gain at all."]{.underline}
Both countries say they will continue talks and have left time before
the latest volley of tariffs kicks in. Trump said Tuesday he will attend
the Group of 20 leaders' summit June 28-29 in Osaka, Japan, where he is
expected to meet with Xi and could resolve their trade dispute. The
threat of Trump's new tariffs will probably hang over those talks as
well. "They want to make a deal," Trump said. "It could absolutely
happen." Others are less sure. "Things have escalated very quickly and
we don't know how the two sides are going to get back to the table,"
said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international
affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Economists, congressional
Republicans and even some administration officials say U.S. consumers
and businesses cannot escape pain from the tit-for-tat tariff fights
that Trump has started with China but also Canada, Mexico and the
European Union. Trump has imposed duties on steel and aluminum from
Canada, Mexico and the European Union, all of which have retaliated with
duties on American farm and other goods. And Trump is weighing new taxes
on imported autos from the EU, Japan and other countries on national
security grounds --- a decision that could come this weekend and is
almost certain to spark a U.S. political backlash if Trump presses ahead
with it. "Ultimately nobody wins a trade war unless there is an
agreement at the end after which tariffs go away," said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, the Senate majority leader, whose own state of Kentucky has
suffered retaliatory tariffs on bourbon and tobacco. "Hopefully these
tactics will lead us to that day, and if it does I think it will be a
winner for both sides." Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as
many policy analysts, have faulted Trump for alienating allies with
tariffs when the administration could have forged a broader coalition
against Chinese trade practices to increase leverage in negotiating with
Beijing. "The lone-wolf approach, after poking all the allies with
sticks over steel and aluminum \... has really soured a lot of countries
on the U.S.," said Daniel Ikenson, director of trade at the Cato
Institute, a libertarian think tank. So far, he noted, the harmful
effects of tariffs have been cushioned by a healthy economy still
getting a boost from tax cuts. [But if the economy weakens and Trump
doesn't make a good deal with China, Ikenson said, "he's going to get
hammered" by Democrats in Rust Belt states that went for Trump in
2016.]{.underline} A former White House aide who spoke on condition of
anonymity said even Trump's most skeptical advisors share his view that
China reneged on a potential deal. The former aide said Trump "was fired
up" and appeared eager for a fight after China allegedly walked back its
commitments. China blamed the Trump administration on Tuesday, claiming
U.S. negotiators changed the terms of Chinese purchases previously
agreed to by both parties. [Trump and his political team believe
"getting tough on China and trade is something that's pretty unifying in
the country" and will view a trade war as a winning campaign message,
whether or not it yields a deal. But a long fight could hurt farming
states that Trump is depending on in his 2020 reelection
bid.]{.underline} For now, Republicans are sticking with Trump even
though his moves cut against the party's traditional policies. Rod
Hunter, a partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie and former senior
director for international economics at the National Security Council
under President George W. Bush, said [Trump's political support on trade
certainly isn't guaranteed. "People are behind it until the day they're
not," he said. "That's politics, that has a lot to do with perceived
strength. And that may change quickly."]{.underline} Sen. Jim Inhofe
(R-Okla.) said, "I'm not going to question his judgment in the
aggressive nature of what he has done because every time I think that in
my own mind, it turns out he's made the right decision." Still, Inhofe
has reservations. [The farmers and agriculture supporters in his state
"are concerned about this but they also have enough faith in the
president --- I know this isn't true in]{.underline} all states, but it
is in Oklahoma." But Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said [Senate
Republicans have limited patience for the aggressive strategy Trump is
pursuing.]{.underline} "If it's to get to low or no tariffs at the end
--- if it's other countries that have high tariffs on us that we put
tariffs on to get them to the table to get to low or no tariffs --- I'm
fine with that," Lankford said. "If the goal is to have high tariffs
long term, that's self destructive. That's not helpful in the long
term."

[Trump\'s China trade stance has political risks as he seeks
re-election]{.underline} Jeff Mason 5 MIN READ WASHINGTON (Reuters) -
[When he ran for president in 2016, Donald Trump delighted crowds with
his harsh rhetoric on China. As he runs for re-election in 2020, he is
likely to keep talking tough, but the reception - at least in some key
states - may not be as euphoric.]{.underline} FILE PHOTO: Flags for U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s \"Keep America Great!\" 2020 re-election
campaign are seen at Jiahao flag factory in Fuyang, Anhui province,
China July 24, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo Trade talks between the
United States and China ran into serious trouble last week as Beijing
backtracked on some key agreements and Trump placed higher tariffs on
hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods, with more to follow.
[The trade war could continue for some time, bleeding directly into
Trump's efforts to win a second four-year term. Some states that helped
propel him to victory in 2016, including farmer-heavy Iowa, have been
hit hard by the trade dispute. "If \... he doesn't resolve this by the
time we get deep into the presidential campaign and we have pain in the
soybean parts of the country \... it's going to be a real problem for
him,]{.underline}" said one former Trump administration official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Soybeans are the most valuable U.S.
farm export but shipments to China dropped to a 16-year low in 2018. The
failure to reach a deal that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other
advisers had recently suggested was close also casts a shadow on Trump's
self-proclaimed deal-making prowess. The president himself said recently
that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be in Washington soon,
presumably to celebrate a deal. Not having an agreement, though, also
underscores Trump's commitment to walk away from a deal that does not
meet his objectives. He walked away from face-to-face talks with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un earlier this year when Kim wanted economic
sanctions lifted in exchange for partial denuclearization. Trump's
advisers are confident, particularly with regard to U.S.-China policy,
that a show of strength will play well with his base. "By and large I
think his tough stance on China benefits him overall," said Sean Spicer,
Trump's former White House spokesman and a former official in the U.S.
Trade Representative's office under Republican President George W. Bush.
"He has shown that he is truly willing to go out and fight." Trump's top
trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has pushed for China to change
its practices on intellectual property, forced technology transfer,
currency manipulation, and other areas of policy. Trump, though
delighted when China agreed to make large purchases of U.S. products
such as soybeans, backed Lighthizer's tough approach and has insisted on
more sensitive structural reforms. That determination has garnered
support from both major U.S. political parties. Senate Democratic leader
Chuck Schumer last week urged Trump to "hang tough" with Beijing. "Don't
back down. Strength is the only way to win with China," he said in a
tweet. Clete Willems, until recently a senior adviser to the president
on trade and economic policy who took part in the China trade talks for
months, said Democrats and Republicans are "pretty united" on the trade
issue. "My expectation is that you won't see people out on the campaign
trail saying 'Back down on China!'" he said. Slideshow (2 Images)
DEAL-MAKER? [But Democratic candidates are almost certain to criticize
Trump's handling of negotiations even if they agree on the need for
significant changes to the trade relationship with China.]{.underline}
"[He just doesn't know how to cut a trade deal \... Trade by tweets does
not work,"]{.underline} Senator Elizabeth Warren said at a weekend
campaign stop in Cincinnati, Ohio. Trump's administration and campaign
team are aware of the pain the tariffs have already caused farmers and
are seeking to blunt the impact of that with government support and by
appealing to farmers' patriotism. "Farmers are patriotic and understand
that someone had to finally call China to account," Tim Murtaugh, the
Trump campaign's communications director, said in an emailed statement.
"Farmers understand the long game, because long-term planning is what
they do, and they know that the end result will be better for the
agricultural economy." The economy will be key in the end. If it remains
strong, Trump will have a record that resonates with voters, even in
states affected by tariffs. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2WA1LWX) [If the economy
falters, however, Trump's record will be undercut and Democrats will
have a greater chance of beating him in critical states such as Iowa,
Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.]{.underline} With his
hopes for a deal suffering a setback, Trump is again talking up the
benefits of tariffs. "Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER, not
weaker. Just sit back and watch!" Trump tweeted on Friday.

TRUMP CHINA TRADE WAR TARIFFS [Republican senators warned that American
farmers are increasingly frustrated by President Donald Trump\'s efforts
to secure a new trade deal with China as the economy braces for further
tariffs imposed by Washington and the inevitable retaliation by
Beijing.]{.underline} Trump\'s announcement on Sunday that he will raise
tariffs on Chinese imports at the end of this week spooked the financial
markets after negotiations between the two powers were earlier seen as
progressing toward a positive resolution of the trade conflict. The U.S.
accuses China of backtracking on past commitments made during
negotiations. Despite this setback, China is still sending a delegation
to Washington to continue talks this week to reach a deal that averts
further tariffs and lifts those already in place, ending a trade war
that has escalated again. [China is a big export market for American
farmers, particularly soybean producers. Beijing targeted the
agricultural sector with its retaliatory tariffs, seeking to cause Trump
political problems that would give it leverage over the U.S. president
in negotiations. \"If he gets a deal, awesome. If he doesn\'t, it\'s
going to hurt,\"]{.underline} Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican,
told The Washington Post, adding that farmers are \"losing their
patience, yeah, but they want to see a deal.\" Senator Pat Roberts, a
Republican from Kansas, also aired concerns from [Trump\'s rural base,
who helped him to secure the White House in 2016---and could stop his
re-election in 2020 if his strategy of pursuing a trade war with China
and others goes awry.]{.underline} \"[There\'s a lot of feeling in farm
country we\'re being used as pawns in this whole
business,\"]{.underline} Roberts told the Post. \"We will benefit
tremendously if we get a good deal, so we\'re hanging in there with the
president. As opposed to hanging separately.\" In July 2018, the Trump
administration launched a \$12 billion bailout program for farmers
struggling during the trade war with China. There were reports of a
surge in farm bankruptcies amid Trump\'s trade disputes. The Federal
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said that from January to June 2018, [84
farm operations in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and
Montana filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection]{.underline}. That is
more than twice the figure in 2014, despite a booming economy.
\"Feedback from farmers, agricultural lenders, suppliers, and other
interests in the ag sector, gathered informally by the Minneapolis Fed
over the past year or so in meetings and other venues, has suggested
that farm balance sheets are increasingly stressed,\" the Fed said.
\"And that nagging economic strain of low commodity prices on farmers
and ranchers---compounded for some by recent tariffs---is starting to
show up not just in bottom line profitability, but in simple
viability,\" the Minneapolis Fed added. In January, President Trump
delivered a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation\'s 100th
annual convention in New Orleans. \"We\'ve had so many good weeks and
good days, and it\'s only going to get better because we\'re doing trade
deals that are going to get you so much business, you\'re not even going
to believe it,\" he said. He later noted: \"Over the last 15 years,
we\'ve seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade
all throughout the world. You know that. It was all going in the wrong
direction. It\'s changing now. Wait until you see what happens.\" Trump
went on: \"If we do the right deal with China, you\'re talking about
massive---they\'re already back-ordering, right? They\'re already back.
I told them. I said, \'You got to start ordering. You\'re going to
order.\' They\'re going to order, and they\'ve already started. We\'re
turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American
farmers, ranchers and, in fact, put America first. That\'s what I\'m
interested in: America first.\" Since Trump took office and began his
trade war, the total value of America\'s agricultural exports to China
decreased from \$17.142 billion in 2017 to \$11.853 billion in 2018, a
drop of 31 percent, data from the Foreign Agricultural Service show. The
fall is set to worsen in the current year. According to the same data,
U.S. agricultural exports to China between October 2017 and February
2018 totaled \$9.76 billion. The same period a year later, between
October 2018 and February 2019, the figure was \$1.61 billion, a decline
of 83.5 percent. [Data from the Economic Research Service shows U.S. net
farm income fell by 9.5 percent on an annual basis to \$91.35 billion in
2018, the lowest level since 2009 during a recession.]{.underline} On
Sunday, the president tweeted his latest intentions regarding trade with
China---more tariffs. \"For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to
the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200
Billion Dollars of other goods,\" Trump wrote. RELATED STORIES Trump

arriving for a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 29. Drew
Angerer/Getty Images [China is using tariffs with the hope of splitting
\"apart different domestic groups\" in the US]{.underline}, according to
a leaked propaganda notice. The notice, which outlined a range of
censored content for Chinese media, included a brief overview of
Beijing\'s trade strategy. [Experts already thought China was trying to
target President Donald Trump\'s political base with its tariffs, but
this appears to be the first time the official strategy has become
public. China is explicitly using tariffs as a wedge issue designed to
split \"apart different domestic groups in the US,\" according to leaked
plans.]{.underline} As a trade war looms between the two countries,
Beijing issued a propaganda notice to Chinese media explaining the
official game plan for handling the issue. It was then leaked online and
published by the censorship-monitoring site China Digital Times.
Alongside instructions to avoid quoting President Donald Trump or other
US officials and to focus instead on \"economic brightspots,\" the
government gave outlets a description of its trade strategy. Vice
Premier Liu, the notice said, \"has indicated that this stage of the
U.S.-China trade conflict requires calm and rationality.\" It added:
\"We stop negotiation for now, acting tit for tat, roll out
corresponding policies, hold public opinion at a good level without
escalating it, limit scope, and strike accurately and carefully,
splitting apart different domestic groups in US.\" The US-China trade
conflict has seen a series of actual tariffs and tariff threats made by
the two countries. [It had already been widely speculated that China\'s
tariffs were targeting Trump\'s political base of support.]{.underline}
This notice appears to be the first time the official government
strategy has become public. [In April, China placed restrictions on
imports of US soybeans, the bulk of which are produced in the Midwest
--- a region crucial for Trump\'s victory in the 2016
election.]{.underline} The president won eight of the top 10
soybean-producing states. Shortly afterward, China placed a 179% tariff
on US sorghum imports. The crop is grown in the Southern states --- an
area that also voted heavily for Trump. Kansas, which Trump won by more
than 20 percentage points, is the top producer of sorghum, and trade
media reported at the time that it would be \"substantially hurt\" by
the measure. According to the Brookings Institution, [82% of counties
that were \"exposed\" to tariffs earlier this year supported Trump in
2016. This had the ability to affect more than 1 million
jobs.]{.underline} \"[The Chinese tariff lists seem optimally designed
to especially agitate President Trump\'s red-state base]{.underline},\"
the Brookings Institution report said. But it is also appears China may
have been using the states as a bargaining chip. In May, the sorghum
penalties were axed the same week Trump received a visit from a Chinese
trade delegation led by Liu, who said the countries had agreed to \"not
fight a trade war.\" China isn\'t the only one seeking to hit Trump
where it hurts. In response to tariffs on steel and aluminum, the
European Union introduced levies on iconic American items including
motorcycles, jeans, and bourbon. Harley-Davidson, which is based in
Wisconsin and manufactures motorcycles there, announced plans to shift
some production overseas in response. The move is essentially a slap in
the face for Trump, who won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point
and has repeatedly praised the company for building bikes in the US.
[When it comes to China, though, the country made its approach clear in
the rest of the leaked censorship notice.]{.underline} \"The trade
conflict is really a war against China\'s rise, to see who has the
greater stamina,\" it said. \"This is absolutely no time for
irresolution or reticence.\"

(D-N.Y.) wants President Trump to "hang tough on China." Of course he
does. [Schumer knows full well that "**hanging tough" on the contentious
effort to reset our trade agreement with Beijing could torch our booming
economy, which is the best and perhaps only way that Democrats will
unseat Trump in 2020**.]{.underline} With Gallup showing the president's
approval rating at an all-time high for his presidency and with the
country giving Trump especially high marks for his handling of the
economy, Democrats would rejoice to see the trade talks stall. If the
president follows through with his threat to sharply hike tariffs,
markets will sell off, and economic growth could slow. Let's be honest:
[The number of Beltway insiders who actually want the president to
succeed in redrafting our trade alliance with China could fit in a
shoebox]{.underline}. Democrats don't make the cut; they know that those
blue-collar workers in the Midwest who elected Trump will flock to the
polls to vote for him again if he concludes a deal that protects
American workers. Joe Biden in particular doesn't want Trump to win the
trade battle with China. The former vice president and today's
frontrunner for the Democratic nomination wants to pretend the problem
doesn't even exist. Biden might then have to explain to voters why he
and his "buddy Barack" --- as he recently described President Obama ---
failed to tackle China's misdeeds during their eight years together in
the White House. During that time, China steadily extracted
manufacturing jobs from the American workers whom Biden is now courting.
At a recent campaign stop, Biden said about the Chinese, "They're not
competition for us." That's how clueless the leading Democratic
contender is. Establishment Republicans aren't so sure they want the
White House to win on this front either. Most align themselves with big
business; the Chamber of Commerce, which represents that group, has
steadfastly opposed Trump's trade approach. America's big corporations,
after all, have for decades benefited from cheap Chinese labor. They
have also worked feverishly to access China's growing middle class and
burgeoning consumer market. For the past 20-30 years, America's CEOs
were content to play along with Beijing's rulebook; they would take in
local partners as required and ignore the copying of their patents and
designs as long as they got their foot in the door. It was a costly
bargain, and more recently some have come to realize the extent of their
firms' sacrifices, but the damage has been done. To be sure, Republican
legislators know they have a better chance of reelection in 2020 if the
economy, and Trump, remain strong. And, for sure, [many Republicans in
Congress represent farming districts; those folks have been hurt by the
tariff tit-for-tats and would welcome the increased exports the talks
promise. But, GOP backers in corporate America are not convinced the
White House is putting their interests first.]{.underline} Opinion
makers of all stripes appear hopeful the talks will end in failure.
After all, those on the right have expressed horror at the very idea of
tariffs, and embrace the concept of free trade with the desperation of a
drowning man clinging to a twig. Everyone knows there is no such thing
as free trade and that commerce between nations is subject to all kinds
of rules and stipulations. But because President Trump has dared to
challenge Beijing's flagrant cheating and thievery, exposing our "free
trade" arrangements as corrupt, he is the intellectual villain in the
piece. On the left, [editorial writers cannot tolerate the thought that
Trump's blunderbuss and unilateral approach might work]{.underline}.
Globalists would have the White House rely on the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to penalize China for cheating, even though the
essential rules of that organization fall drastically short of getting
the job done. Members of the global institution undertook a spirited
effort to re-write the WTO's regulations nearly two decades ago once
China's misuse of state-owned enterprises (and other abuses) became
apparent, but the talks were abandoned after seven futile years. Trump
would not depend on the WTO. [In the past couple of weeks, there have
been leaked reports that President Trump is backing down from his tough
demands in order to secure a quick deal, nervous about reelection and
wary of upsetting markets.]{.underline} Consequently, the story goes,
White House negotiators have dropped their requirements that China swear
off intellectual property theft and also end subsidies of state-owned
enterprises. That has been the spin from the liberal media, which, as a
deal appeared imminent, has been attempting to soft-pedal what would be
an extraordinary achievement. Taking on China in a bruising trade
negotiation was a bold move on the part of President Trump, and another
way in which he fulfilled campaign promises. If Trump were to succeed,
America's farmers and industries will benefit; it would be another major
win for this unlikely president. Better for his critics to portray any
agreement that emerges as weak or insufficient. The truth is just the
opposite. The Chinese were apparently trying to wiggle out of
commitments already made, and the U.S. negotiators were having none of
it; hence, Trump's renewed threat to raise tariffs. There may yet be
more delays in the talks; markets may swoon as a result. [Make no
mistake, a hefty increase in tariffs and retaliatory measures by China
could slow growth and in the short term hurt American consumers. The
White House appears ready to pay that price to curb China's cheating and
stealing. They appear willing, in short, to "hang tough," despite the
political consequences. That's a measure of President Trump's commitment
to put America's workers first.]{.underline}

#### Plan exposes Trump's vulnerability with swing voters- perceived as abandoning alliances

**Axios 5/20/19**

American news and information website founded in 2016 by former Politico
staffers Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen, and Roy Schwartz. It officially
launched in 2017; Trade War and Russia Top Voters' Concerns About
Trump's Foreign Policy, Poll Finds,
https://www.countable.us/articles/27864-trade-war-russia-top-voters-concerns-trump-s-foreign-policy-poll-finds

[A new poll]{.underline} designed [to test]{.underline} President
[Trump's vulnerabilities on foreign policy heading into the 2020
election finds that]{.underline} economic pain from the China trade war,
[unraveling alliances]{.underline} and Trump's relations with Russia
[are of particular concern to swing voters]{.underline}. Data: Hart
Research Associates survey of 1,205 likely voters conduced April 23-27,
2019; Chart: Axios Visuals Why it matters: The poll was commissioned by
National Security Action, a group founded by former top Obama
Administration officials that is advising Democratic candidates on
foreign policy. Jeff Prescott, the group's executive director, says that
[while Republicans and incumbents traditionally have an advantage on
national security, that\'s undercut by concerns over Trump's
temperament. He contends that Democrats have "**a real opportunity to go
on offense" on foreign policy in 2020**.]{.underline} The big picture:
Trump significantly outperforms his 44% overall approval rating when it
comes to national security, on which 55% of all likely voters and 63% of
undecided voters approve of his performance. Pollster Geoff Garin says
that\'s in part because voters aren't paying as much attention to
foreign policy as they are to other issues. He says Trump\'s support
dwindles when voters are asked about specific policies and actions.
[Voters tend to approve of many aspects of Trump's foreign
policy,]{.underline} such as pushing NATO countries to spend more on
defense and attempting negotiations with North Korea. However, 46%
believe Trump has made America less safe, compared to 38% who say he's
made the country safer. Meanwhile, 57% believe he has made America less
respected around the world, while 67% worry he "lacks the temperament we
need in a commander-in-chief." What to watch: 41% of respondents say
Trump's foreign policy is a reason to re-elect him, 45% say it's a
reason to elect someone else, and 14% say it's not a consideration.
Given a range of foreign policy considerations and asked to select the
most important, swing voters prioritize "protecting Americans from
terrorism," "keeping America out of war" and "standing up for American
values like human rights and democracy." Voters trust Democrats more
than Republicans to keep the U.S. out of war, work effectively with
other countries and defend American values, but trust Republicans more
to protect the country from terrorism. [The pollsters also tested 20
potential lines of attack against Trump, and found that undecided voters
were most concerned that Trump was]{.underline} weakening alliances[,
**defending dictators**]{.underline} and waging a trade war that will
cost jobs and raise prices. The bottom line: [Trump fares reasonably
well with undecided voters on national security, but that support
appears brittle]{.underline}. Prescott says **[that underlines the need
for Democrats to challenge him on these issues in 2020.]{.underline}**

#### Plan gives Trump a foreign policy win- this undercuts democratic strategy and gets swing voters key to 2020

**Metz 4/5/19**

Steven Metz is the author of "Iraq and the Evolution of American
Strategy." His WPR column appears every Friday; World Politics Review,
How Foreign Policy Will Play Out in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Race,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/27735/how-foreign-policy-will-play-out-in-the-2020-u-s-presidential-race

[Foreign policy rarely plays a major role in]{.underline} U.S.
presidential [elections]{.underline}. The United States has always been
an insular nation. Particularly for people in the American heartland,
the world's troubles seem far away. The connectivity of the modern world
and the globalization of terrorism have challenged that insularity, but
even so, national elections seldom pivot on international affairs.
**[2020 could be different]{.underline}**: [Debates over American
foreign policy and national security could sway enough undecided voters
to tip the scales]{.underline}, and the political [battle lines are
already forming]{.underline}. As Alex Ward pointed out in Vox, President
[Donald Trump is likely to sell a story of foreign policy
successes]{.underline} to voters in the upcoming campaign: that he
defeated the Islamic State; stopped North Korean nuclear and missile
testing; repaired U.S. relations with Israel; pushed back on Iran,
Venezuela and Russia; fixed some trade problems; increased U.S. military
spending; compelled some additional defense spending in Europe; and made
progress on an Afghanistan peace process. How will Democrats respond?
"We have to run on a proactive message of our own," a campaign staffer
to one Democratic presidential candidate told Ward, "instead of spending
all of our time attacking Trump." [What will that entail? Here are five
key points that the Democratic candidates]{.underline}, and the eventual
presidential nominee, [will likely use to dispute Trump's
narrative.]{.underline} First, the [Democrats will point out that Trump
has not resolved any major conflicts or eradicated any
threats]{.underline}, but just kicked the can down the road, leaving
problems for later presidents to deal with. North Korea, for instance,
has paused its weapons testing several times in the past as a bargaining
tool or simply because it didn't need to test them. Everything suggests
the current pause is one more instance of that, rather than a
Trump-engineered diplomatic victory. Meanwhile, the Islamic State has,
in fact, lost its territorial "caliphate" in Syria and Iraq, but it is
far from defeated. Today it is going underground and dispersing, biding
its time until a later date. It will be back, whether before the 2020
election or sometime after. Yet Trump has no integrated counter-ISIS
strategy beyond destroying its self-declared caliphate. [Second, the
Democrats will condemn Trump for the damage he has done to America's
alliances]{.underline} and security partnerships. While the modest
increases in European defense spending are a good thing, NATO is weaker
than it's ever been, largely because of Trump's continuous political
attacks and disinterest in leading the alliance. As Nicholas Burns and
Douglas Lute, both former U.S. ambassadors to NATO, recently wrote in
The Washington Post, nearly all of the alliance's past and present
leaders consider Trump "NATO's most urgent and difficult problem." To
counter the growing challenge from China and Russia, Burns and Lute
argue, the United States will need support from NATO, but it may not be
able to count on it under the current political conditions. The
Democratic presidential candidate is certain to echo this warning.
[While the Democrats will never sway Trump's loyal base, **pointing out
the flaws in his foreign policy might influence undecided
voters**]{.underline}. Third, [Democrats will point out that while Trump
has often criticized America's "endless wars"]{.underline} against
violent jihadism, [he has not ended them]{.underline}. In both Syria and
Afghanistan, Trump cannot decide between walking away and remaining
involved. In Syria, he wants someone else---whether Arab nations or
Europeans---to replace the United States on the ground to prevent the
Islamic State from rebounding, but he has no plan to make that happen.
In Afghanistan, Trump has escalated the air war against the Taliban to
little effect. He has begun a peace process with the Taliban, but so far
there is little reason to believe that it will end the long conflict in
Afghanistan while preserving the democratic government in Kabul. And, in
the broadest sense, Trump has not disavowed what got the United States
embroiled in the endless wars in the first place: the idea that fighting
jihadists in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria or other parts of the Islamic
world somehow diminishes the chances of terrorist attacks in the United
States. Fourth, **[Democrats will attack Trump's coziness with brutal
dictators,]{.underline}** particularly his claims of "friendship\" and
"love" for North Korea's Kim Jong Un, his persistent refusal to
criticize Russia's Vladimir Putin, [his closeness with Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman]{.underline}, and his praise for Egyptian
autocrat Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, whom he will host at the White House next
week. Although past presidents have of course dealt with dictators when
necessary, they often went out of their way to explain that the
relationship was repugnant but necessary. [Trump]{.underline}, by
contrast, [shows genuine affinity for friendly dictators. Rather than
grudging toleration, he seems to like them,]{.underline} or at least
feel some sort of kinship with them. Democrats will hammer this point,
arguing that it damages U.S. national interests in the long run and
undercuts America's ability to exercise global leadership. Fifth,
Democrats will argue that while Trump stresses the crisis on America's
southern border, he has not produced anything close to a comprehensive
strategy to deal with it. In fact, rather than address the root causes
of outmigration in Central America, he recently announced that he was
cutting off economic assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
Outside core Republican voters, few Americans support building a wall on
the southern border---the crown jewel of Trump's approach to
immigration. **[In broad terms, then, the Democratic critique of Trump's
foreign policy is likely to be that it promises much but delivers
little]{.underline}** and that it is dangerously short-sighted, possibly
producing a few near term "wins" but doing long-term damage to American
national security. Barring a major international crisis or an attack on
the United States, foreign policy won't sway the 2020 election. The
state of the economy, health care, questions about presidential
character, and the ability of Trump to convince a strategic majority of
Americans that the United States does, in fact, face a major threat from
immigration will instead determine its outcome. Yet **[while the
Democrats will never sway Trump's loyal base, pointing out the flaws in
his foreign policy might influence undecided voters]{.underline}**. This
is an admittedly small group in today's hyperpartisan political
environment, but **[it could prove decisive in a close
race.]{.underline}**

Gulf states, and---last but not least---it was a great visit for
magical, glowing orbs. I want to spend a little time talking about one
of the reasons why the trip went so well. I'll warn you: This is a
somewhat taboo subject for progressive foreign-policy types. The
subject, friends, is arms sales. [Progressives don't like arms sales

government, you know this is what is called a "deliverable," the clunky
management-consultantese term for a tangible outcome of a visit or
meeting. When Donald Trump is asked to justify his trip to Saudi Arabia,
he'll cite that \$110 billion in arms sales. There are a few interesting
things about these sales. The first is that many of these sales were
already in the works. The Obama administration spent eight years quietly
selling a lot of arms to Saudi Arabia: When President Obama left office,
for example, the United States still had \$100 billion in the foreign
military sales pipeline with Saudi Arabia and, in 2011, had inked what
was previously the largest arms sale in U.S. history with the
Kingdom---a \$29 billion deal to sell F-15s to the Saudis. MORE STORIES

[Obama-era sales to Saudi Arabia were in keeping with sales to other
Gulf states: Both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates bought a tremendous
amount of U.S. arms between 2009 and 2017.]{.underline} Qatar bought
more U.S. arms than any other state in 2014 and, in the waning days of
the Obama administration, announced that it would buy nearly \$4 billion
in Boeing-made F-15s in addition to \$19 billion in commercial aircraft,
also from Boeing. [Overall, the Arab Gulf states went on a spending
spree during the Obama years, and most of the money was spent on
American arms.]{.underline} So why didn't you hear a lot about this from
Democratic politicians during the 2016 election season? There are two
main reasons---one strategic and one moral. Strategically, not everyone
is convinced that arming the Arab Gulf states to the teeth is a wise
idea. Some worry that these arms might someday endanger Israel's
security, while others worry the Arab Gulf states might be encouraged to
use their new toys on disastrous military interventions against Iran or
Iranian proxies in, say, Yemen. The quick and unsatisfying answer to
these concerns is the global market. The Arab Gulf states have money,
and that money will buy the weapons that are available. If U.S. arms are
not for sale, fine: French, Chinese, or Russian arms will be. (And if
you don't believe me, look at the way in which Gulf states---frustrated
by U.S. export controls on drone technology---are turning to the
Chinese.) Selling U.S. arms to the Gulf states, by contrast, further
ties them to U.S. interests by deepening cooperation and
interoperability between the U.S. military and its Gulf partners. One of
the reasons Qatar wanted to buy U.S. fighters to partially replace its
French-made fleet, for example, was because they discovered how
difficult it was for their existing fighter aircraft to fly with the
U.S. air force as part of coalitions over Libya and Syria. [Arms sales
also drive down the cost of our own weapons and thus the amount of money
U.S. tax-payers have to spend on defense instead of other priorities
like, say, the State Department, school lunches, or housing
subsidies.]{.underline} Here's one example: Because the United States is
buying fewer F-35s than originally planned and using more of its "fourth
generation" fighters (F-15s, F-16s, etc.) in the skies over Iraq and
Syria than previously anticipated, the Department of Defense will likely
need to buy more of those fourth generation fighters in the coming
years. The recent sales of F-15s to Qatar, F-18s to Kuwait, and F-16s to
Bahrain will drive down the cost per plane for the Pentagon. That's a
good thing---at least financially. Morally, though, [many progressives
just grow ill at the idea of selling weapons abroad]{.underline}.
Senator Chris Murphy, for example---one of the more eloquent and
consistent critics of U.S. arms sales in the Senate, even though his own
state has a very robust defense industrial base---sees nothing admirable
about the idea of selling weapons to the Saudis that might be used in
Yemen. Other progressives agree: Yes, they argue, we understand the
demand of the market will be met by someone, but do we have to be
complicit in providing the supply? In other countries, progressives have
even taken to the courts in an effort to halt sales. I have a lot of
respect for these progressives and their values. I spent too much time
in Sunday School as a kid to not feel a little uneasy about the business
of selling weapons[. And the angst many progressives feel about U.S.
arms sales has been enough to keep many Democrats from talking up their
successes in helping U.S. industry abroad. I wonder, though, if there
isn't a real political cost to not doing so. Boeing employs 157,000
people---almost all of them in the United States. 14,500 people work in
Boeing's facilities in Missouri, where the F-15 and F-18 are
made,]{.underline} where Senator Claire McCaskill is up for reelection
next year, and [where Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton 56 to 38
percent in 2016. (]{.underline}Those 14,500 people do not include the
many thousands of other Americans who make parts for the F-15 and F-18
elsewhere in America.) [Lockheed Martin, meanwhile, a huge winner in the
recent arms deal with Saudi Arabia]{.underline} (despite ace businessman
Jared Kushner negotiating the price down on behalf of the Saudis),
[employs an additional 97,000 workers---again, most of them in the
United States. And Raytheon, another big winner last week, employs
another 60,000 or so Americans.]{.underline} Donald Trump obviously has
no moral qualms about selling weapons to our partners and allies abroad.
And so while Democrats leave points on the board with working-class
voters by not talking about how much Democrats do to support U.S.
industry[, Republicans swoop in to take credit with assembly line
workers]{.underline} for even those things that Obama approved and set
in motion. [The way in which Trump brags about U.S. arms sales, of
course, is in keeping with the strain of economic mercantilism that ran
through his populist campaign message. That message worked with voters
throughout the Midwest, helping to cost Clinton the
election.]{.underline} So while progressives might have moral qualms
about companies that sell weapons[, the roughly 1.2 million American
voters who work in the aerospace and defense sector---together with the
roughly 3.2 million Americans who support the sector indirectly---see
little wrong with the sales that help ensure their livelihoods and
provide a future for their children.]{.underline} This might be another
area in which [progressive elites]{.underline}---who have the kinds of
education and skills that don't require them to seek work on the
assembly line---[are simply out of touch with the voters they need to
win back control of the]{.underline} Congress and state assemblies,
never mind the [presidency.]{.underline} And politics aside, surely even
the moral calculus of arms sales gets more complicated when you think
about the millions of American mouths that are fed by mothers and
fathers who work in the aerospace and defense sector. [Donald Trump, for
his part, is speaking to those voters.]{.underline} And even as
[progressives]{.underline} fret about U.S. arms sales, they
[should]{.underline} also [fret about what it will mean for the rest of
their agenda when Republicans claim credit for protecting some of the
last good assembly-line jobs in America.]{.underline}

[WHAT MATTERS?]{.underline} Click here to watch Episode 4: \"What
Matters\" [As we mentioned above, out of 137 million votes cast in the
2016 election, Trump's win came down to just 80,000 in three states ---
Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.]{.underline} "I think everybody
understands now that [the Midwest is critical to an Electoral College
victory]{.underline}," said Dr. Bennion. Dr. Bennion told us that
[Democrats took this part of the country for granted in the last
election, which probably explains why three of the people running this
time around call the Midwest home.]{.underline} But putting that aside,
do those 80,000 voters feel any differently three years later? [As we
traveled, it became clear what issue is at the top of the list \-- the
economy]{.underline}. Something the president brags about a lot. Taurean
speaks with voters in a barbershop in Vigo County, Indiana. We heard
about the good from people like Feller, who owns a landscaping business
in Vigo County. ["\[Trump's\] done stuff for small businesses and stuff
like myself,"]{.underline} he said. "I feel we pay way too much in taxes
as people that own businesses." We also heard about the bad from people
like Tyler Kelemen and Maria Bailey in Van Buren County. [They told us
young people in this area really struggle to find jobs]{.underline}
beyond minimum wage ones in fast food restaurants. "Yeah the wages have
went up, but we're all still struggling," said Kelemen. "All the
children are coming back to their parents' to live because they can't
afford to get their own places," said Bailey. From a General Motors

Bennion. We headed west, making our way through quaint downtowns and
quiet farms in Sauk County. We stopped by the Spam Museum and wind
turbines that dot Mower County. It's a world away from so much --- over
1,500 miles away from the US-Mexico border. But that didn't stop people
from bringing up their frustrations with the immigration system in
America. "This country just does not have room to accept all the people
that want to come into this country," said Tom Morem, a retiree in Mower
County who we spoke to at McDonald's. In Sauk County, we stopped by an
American flag store that caught our attention and met Kathy Gonzales.
"Who's footing the bill on that?" she asked, referring to migrants who
illegally cross over into the United States. "I understand it's millions
of millions of dollars that the U.S. government is paying to take care
of these people. So there is a system, and they should follow it." At
the root of these political debates is a theme we picked up on
throughout our travels. [People in the Midwest are still fighting to be
seen and heard.]{.underline} "It does honestly feel like we have been
forgotten," said Kelemen, sitting in his pickup truck in rural Van Buren
County. In Indiana, Kelly Mason called up her husband, Jeremy, because
he's so passionate about this. "[Both \[political\] parties have gone so
far extreme they've left us flyover states pretty much fending for
ourselves," "Both \[political\] parties have gone so far extreme they've
left us flyover states pretty much fending for ourselves," he
said.]{.underline} And a few miles away, Isabella Fox, a student at
Indiana State University in Terre Haute, told us she just wants
candidates to visit. "Because no one ever comes through here," she said.
[They want attention. And they want someone who is genuine.]{.underline}
No matter where we went, the word 'authenticity' kept coming up,
unprompted. "If \[politicians\] say that they're going to do something,
they need to follow up on it, too," said Audrey Frave, who spoke with us
along the shore of Lake Michigan in Van Buren County. Because what
matters most to people here is that politicians have a plan for the next
chapter. "We're starting to see what shape these post-industrial, Rust
Belt cities might take in the future," said Dr. Bennion. "And so
candidates will need to be able to address that new future." In
Michigan, Whitmer was able to hold eight counties won by Clinton in
2016, while turning nine counties from red to blue. ["The base of so
many Republican victories in the past, with a strong Republican vote out
of suburbia, at this point looks to be a thing of the
past]{.underline}," Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, told The Wall
Street Journal. [These trends don't guarantee a Democratic victory in
2020. Exit polls show that Republicans still maintain a healthy lead in
rural areas, particularly amongst non-college educated
whites.]{.underline} Centrist Democrats in rural America such as
Senators Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Claire McCaskill in Missouri were
handily defeated. Anthony Fowler, an associate professor at the Harris
School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, told The Globe
Post that while some voters, particularly women, may have been turned
off by Trump's behavior, "Most voters care a lot more about taxes, jobs,
economic growth, etc. than they care about personal shortcomings."
Fowler concluded that ["white, working-class voters in industrial
states" like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania who voted for Obama
in 2012 but turned to Trump in 2016, "will be important again" in
2020.]{.underline}

pundits have immediately shifted attention to the 2020 presidential
election. [The key to victory for both Republicans and Democrats may lie
in three critical swing states: Wisconsin, Michigan, and
Pennsylvania.]{.underline} Although Donald Trump lost the popular vote
in 2016 by nearly 3 million votes, his victories in these three states
helped him secure the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the
presidency over Hillary Clinton. [Clinton's inability to win Midwestern
states like Michigan, which she lost by less than 12,000 votes, proved
to be her downfall.]{.underline} The last time a Republican presidential
candidate won Michigan was George H.W. Bush in 1988. Winning these three
states would have put Clinton at 278 electoral votes compared to Donald
Trump's 260. William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute
and former deputy assistant of domestic policy for President Bill
Clinton, believes that [Hillary's biggest mistake in 2016 was not
focusing enough resources in the Midwest.]{.underline} "The Midwest is
the cake, Florida is the frosting," Galston said at a panel discussion
at the Brookings Institute last week. While he said Democrats shouldn't
completely abandon making inroads in sun-belt states like Florida and
Georgia, [winning in the Midwest is more realistic and thus more
important.]{.underline} Tuesday's midterm results may worry Republicans
eager to eat more cake in 2020. [All three Midwestern states held
gubernatorial elections, which were all won by Democrats (Tony Evers in
Wisconsin, Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Tom Wolf in Pennsylvania).

managed to flip five counties that voted for Trump in 2016.]{.underline}

Association's annual meeting, President [Trump said he would end U.S.

Senate.CreditCreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Times By Katie Rogers
April 26, 2019 INDIANAPOLIS --- I[n a speech to National Rifle
Association members on Friday that was part political rally and part pep
talk, President Trump called himself a champion of gun rights. Then he
proved it, whipping out a pen onstage to sign a letter that would
effectively cease America's involvement in an arms treaty designed to
regulate the international sale of conventional weapons.]{.underline}
Mr. Trump said that his administration "will never" ratify [the Arms
Trade Treaty]{.underline}, which [seeks to discourage the sale of
conventional weapons to countries that do not protect human
rights.]{.underline} Although the accord was brokered by the United
Nations and signed by President Barack Obama, it has never been ratified
by the Senate. Experts in arms control note that the accord, even if
ratified by the Senate, would not require the United States to alter any
existing domestic laws or procedures governing how it sells conventional
weapons overseas. Still, Mr. Trump said his decision to sign a letter
asking the Senate to send the treaty back to the White House "is a big,
big factor," calling the accord a "badly misguided" arrangement. [To
supporters of the decision, making certain that the United States does
not ratify the treaty is one more step toward deregulation that Mr.
Trump has championed]{.underline}. In a call with reporters, a senior
administration official said that a major factor in his decision was the
lack of compliance with the treaty from other large conventional arms
exporters, including China and Russia. The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the United States had its own set of
controls to ensure the appropriate sale of arms abroad, and added that
the Trump administration opposed possible future amendments to the
treaty up for consideration in 2020. Critics [see it as a concession to
the gun lobby, and another effort by the Trump administration to
distance itself from multilateral diplomatic initiatives]{.underline}
--- from the nuclear deal with Iran to the Paris climate agreement ---
that advocates say are meant to make the world a safer place. "The
president's action today is yet another mistaken step that threatens to
make the world less safe, rather than more secure," Thomas Countryman, a
former assistant secretary of state for international security and
nonproliferation and lead American negotiator on the Arms Trade Treaty,
said in a statement. Mr. Countryman also pointed out that a ratification
of the treaty would not have caused the United States to change any
existing laws or procedures governing how it sells the weapons. "It is
sad, but to be expected, that this president opposes efforts to require
other countries to meet the high standards of U.S. military export
decisions," Mr. Countryman said. Mr. Trump's move means that the United
States would be in the company of countries like North Korea and Iran,
who abstained from participation in the treaty, and leaving behind a
group of the world's largest gun manufacturers, including France and
Germany, who signed on. [But in Indianapolis, the president's
announcement prompted a standing ovation, as did some of the other
red-meat campaign rally topics.]{.underline} Mr. Trump touted gains in
the economy and railed against a "corrupt" news media. He also
disparaged the special counsel investigation into his campaign that he
said had been part of a coup attempt carried out at the highest levels
of the government. "They tried for a coup, didn't work out so well," Mr.
Trump said. "Didn't need a gun for that one, did I?" [The president's
speech delivered a much-appreciated shot in the arm to an organization
besieged by inner turmoil.]{.underline} A group known for deploying
steely messaging toward its enemies, the N.R.A. --- which billed itself
as "freedom's safest place" during its annual convention this year ---
fed attendees a steady diet of slogans to suggest that their beliefs,
way of life and ability to protect themselves is put at stake by
Hollywood, politicians and the press. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike
Pence helped reinforce that idea in front of a stadium crowd as they
took jabs at 2020 Democrats and the party's most liberal factions.
"Under this president and this vice president," Mr. Pence said, "no one
is taking your guns." The N.R.A. was hit with a rebuke for its lobbying
tactics this month when the Democratic-controlled House approved a
revamped Violence Against Women Act that would bar those convicted of
abusing, assaulting or stalking a domestic partner from buying guns. Mr.
Trump disparaged this and other legislative attempts as a move by
Democrats to ensure that "bad guys" keep their guns. The legislative
setback played out as the N.R.A. has endured scrutiny over desperate
calls for fund-raising and a rare dirty-laundry lawsuit. Earlier this
month, the N.R.A. sued the ad firm Ackerman McQueen, one of its closest
contractors and the operator of its media arm and the NRATV channel, of
mishandling \$40 million that it and its affiliates receive annually
from the association. It has also been named in a lawsuit filed against
the Federal Election Commission by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent
Gun Violence, which has accused the group of abusing campaign finance
laws to funnel money toward Mr. Trump and several other Republicans. (In
a statement, the N.R.A. called it a "lawsuit based on a frivolous
complaint.") ["There's definitely some bad news and the N.R.A.
internally is suffering from some major turmoil,"]{.underline} Adam
Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles,
who specializes in the Second Amendment, said in an interview. "[But
there's been some major success with Donald Trump." Members of the
N.R.A.'s five-million-strong gun rights advocates, who have supported
Mr. Trump from his days as a long shot Republican presidential
candidate, looked toward his visit as welcome fuel to continue battling
well-funded gun control groups and Democrats in the House.]{.underline}
"The president is the most enthusiastic supporter of the Second
Amendment that has occupied the White House in recent history," Jennifer
Baker, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, said in an interview. Ms. Baker added that
N.R.A. members have been fervently pro-Trump since the beginning because
they understood what was at risk. "Our members are pretty politically
astute," Ms. Baker said. "The Supreme Court was at stake, and in recent
history we haven't had a presidential nominee that was so unabashed and
vocal about their support for the Second Amendment and our
organization." [In his public comments, the president has not always
been the most reliable ally, and at times he has --- at least
momentarily --- embraced the types of gun-control proposals favored by
Democrats]{.underline}. In the days after a mass shooting at a Florida
high school last year, the president encouraged lawmakers to stand up to
the N.R.A., and suggested a policy of "take the guns first, go through
due process second" for people thought to be mentally ill. [Days later,
the president retreated from those comments shortly after a private
meeting with N.R.A. leaders. He has since pushed for a ban on bump
stocks --- a modest move considered to be no great loss by the N.R.A.
--- and suggested that the arming of teachers could make schools
safer.]{.underline} The Trump administration has largely decided to
blame gun violence on access to mental health care over curbing access
to guns. But according to a recent Reuters poll, the majority of
Americans support tougher gun control laws, even if they have little
faith that lawmakers will be able to pass them. ["After Parkland,
President Trump said he'd support common-sense gun safety laws, but
instead, his administration has simply recycled tired gun lobby rhetoric
in attempt to juice slumping gun sales,"]{.underline} Shannon Watts,
founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said in a
statement.

Treaty]{.underline} Date created : 27/04/2019 - 07:54 Latest update :
27/04/2019 - 20:53 Bryan Woolston, Reuters \| US President Donald Trump
walks on stage to address the crowds at the annual National Rifle
Association (NRA) convention in Indianapolis, USA, April 26, 2019. Text
by: NEWS WIRES [In a **largely symbolic gesture** to a group that helped
him win the White House, President Donald Trump said Friday he is
pulling the US back from an international deal on the arms trade,
telling the National Rifle Association it is "badly
misguided."]{.underline} Trump made the announcement at the NRA's annual
convention, where [he vowed to fight for gun rights and implored members
of the nation's largest pro-gun group]{.underline} - struggling to
maintain its influence - [to rally behind his re-election
bid.]{.underline} "It's under assault," he said of the constitutional
right to bear arms. "But not while we're here." [With pro-gun
legislation largely stalled in Congress and few deliverables during
Trump's term so far, the president told the group that he would be
revoking the United States' status as a signatory of the U.N. Arms Trade
Treaty, which regulates the multibillion-dollar global arms trade in
conventional weapons, from small arms to battle tanks, combat aircraft
and warships.]{.underline} President Barack Obama signed the pact, which
has long been opposed by the NRA, in 2013. But it has never been
ratified by U.S. lawmakers. "Under my administration, we will never
surrender American sovereignty to anyone," Trump said, before signing a
document on stage directing the Senate to halt the ratification process.
"We will never allow foreign diplomats to trample on your Second
Amendment freedom." ["I hope you're happy," he told the
group,]{.underline} then appeared surprised by the cheers. "I'm
impressed," he said. "I didn't think too many of you would really know
what it is." [His move against the treaty came as Trump sought to excite
an organization that was pivotal to his victory in 2016]{.underline}
but, three years later, is limping toward the next election divided and
diminished. And it represents just the latest in a series of withdrawals
from international pacts and organizations joined by previous
administrations, like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear
deal. Gun activists had denounced the treaty when it was under
negotiation as an infringement of civilian firearm ownership, despite
the well-enshrined legal principle that says no treaty can override the
Constitution or U.S. laws. The treaty is aimed at cracking down on
illicit trading in small arms, thereby curbing violence in some of the
most troubled corners of the world. It was the first legally binding
treaty to regulate the international trade in conventional arms and was
overwhelmingly approved by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly in April
2013. It has been ratified by 101 countries - but key arms exporters
including Russia and China and major importers such as India and Egypt
have given no indication that they will sign it. Advocates of tighter
gun restrictions and those who had helped negotiate the treaty denounced
Trump's decision Friday. Kris Brown, president of the Brady
organization, said will "only embolden terrorists and other dangerous
actors around the world." And Rachel Stohl, managing director of the
Stimson Center and a consultant to the treaty negotiations, said: "By
turning its back on multilateral diplomacy yet again, the United States
is disregarding global norms and allowing nefarious actors to trade
weapons with impunity." Yet Trump's showy rejection of the agreement
from the stage has limited effect because it has been unlikely all along
that he would send the treaty to the Senate for ratification. At the
United Nations, spokesman Stephane Dujarric called the treaty "a
landmark achievement in the efforts to ensure responsibility in
international arms transfers" and particularly important at a time of
renewed interest in expanding weapons arsenals. NRA\'s influence waning
Trump's speech came at a troubled time for the gun rights organization,
a one-time Republican kingmaker, which has been grappling with
infighting, bleeding money and facing a series of investigations into
its operating practices, including allegations that covert Russian
agents seeking to influence the 2016 election courted its officials and
funneled money through the group. As Trump landed in Indianapolis, a
judge imposed an 18-month prison term on gun rights activist Maria
Butina, an admitted Russian agent who, according to her plea agreement,
worked with a former Russian lawmaker to use their contacts in the NRA
to pursue back channels to American conservatives during the 2016
presidential campaign. While the group had high hopes for easing gun
regulations after pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into 2016
campaigns, much of the legislation the group championed has stalled,
due, in part, to a series of mass shootings, including the massacre at a
Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 dead. Adam Winkler, a UCLA
law professor and expert on gun policy, allowed that the group had
scored some victories under Trump, including the appointment of two
Supreme Court justices who may be open to striking down gun laws. But
overall, he said, "[On the legislative front, the NRA has been
frustrated," with priorities like national reciprocity for conceal carry
laws and a repeal of the ban on silencers stalled. Instead, Trump
introduced a new federal regulation: a ban on bump stocks after a man
using the device opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers on the Las Vegas
strip, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds. That bothered some
members attending the convention, even as many donned "Make America
Great Again" hats and cheered Trump loudly.]{.underline} Mike Cook, who
works at a shipyard in Alabama, said [he's been disappointed that gun
rights haven't seen much movement under Trump. The bump stock ban, in
particular, upset him because it was done administratively by Trump
officials.]{.underline}

Gun Reform Could Shape the 2020 Election,\"

2\) [There's a new crop of gun safety voters: young people After
Parkland, young people immediately organized, registered to vote, and
cast their ballots. Ultimately this led to record turnout for youth in
last year's elections---a 48% increase from 2014. This could have major
implications for 2020 in driving increased turnout among young people
for gun safety candidates.]{.underline} More on that huge bump in
turnout: The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and
Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University estimates that [roughly 31
percent of youth (ages 18-29) turned out to vote in the 2018
midterms,]{.underline} an extraordinary increase over their estimate in
2014, when day-after exit poll calculation suggested that 21 percent of
eligible young voters went to the polls. Historic voter registration:
Giffords, joined by NextGen America, Acronym, and Everytown, launched
Our Lives Our Vote, a nationwide drive to register young voters ahead of
the 2018 midterm around the need for gun reform. The campaign registered
over 60,000 18-and-19-year-olds. Where it all started: It started with
[March for Our Lives---arguably the largest single-day protest in the
history of the nation's capital---and then turned into a year of
engaging young people around the issue of gun violence]{.underline},
including coordinating a national school walkout, staging emotional
pop-up art installations, and mailing birthday presents in the form of
voter registration information to kids on their eighteenth birthdays. 3)
[The NRA is officially toxic Last year we saw big business cut ties with
the NRA in the wake of Parkland. **An NRA endorsement has gone from
badge of honor to badge of disgrace.** We even saw politicians from both
sides of the aisle openly reject their endorsements, going from an A to
an F. The results of last year's election go to show that the NRA is
officially toxic and that its reputation isn't improving anytime
soon]{.underline}. NRA favorability still down: A recent report from the
Navigator Research project showed that [the NRA decline in favorability
has NOT rebounded since Parkland and that it's a major net-negative for
politicians associated. Voters don't want NRA influence in elections:
Just a week before the election, polling showed **that 67 percent of
voters prefer a candidate who does not take money from the gun lobby.**
Candidates used their challengers' NRA endorsement against
them]{.underline}: 35 of the NRA's top-champions in the House were
defeated, the majority of whom accepted gun lobby contributions and
A-ratings while blocking progress on all action to strengthen gun laws.
What a difference two years makes: Just two years ago, the NRA spent
more than \$50 million on the 2016 campaign. Last year, it spent a mere
fraction of that and was outspent by gun safety groups like Giffords. 4)
[Suburban voters are passionate about gun safety]{.underline} It's been
noted that the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is
built on big victories in suburban districts, and gun safety was a top
issue for suburban voters. In a poll taken one week before the election,
[suburban women are "a crucial voting bloc on virtually every issue" and
prefer]{.underline} the Democratic Party---which supports [stronger gun
laws]{.underline}---to handle gun violence by 26 percentage points.
[Polls taken in suburban swing districts all showed that when voters
found out that their representative was supported by the NRA, they
received less support.]{.underline} This includes: VA-10 where Jennifer
Wexton unseated NRA-backed Barbara Comstock CO-06 where Jason Crow
unseated NRA-backed Jason Crow MN-02 where Angie Craig unseated
NRA-backed Jason Lewis Gone are the days where candidates had to tread
lightly when it came to talking about gun violence prevention in swing
districts. [**Suburban voters made gun safety a top issue**, and until
something is done to stem the tide of gun violence, it's safe to say
their focus on the issue will remain.]{.underline} 5) Gun safety even
plays in the deep red states Yes, **[gun safety was a big issue in lots
of suburban swing districts in increasingly liberal states like
Virginia, Nevada, and Colorado. But Texas, Georgia, and Kansas?
Surprisingly, also yes]{.underline}**. Georgia: Lucy McBath in Georgia's
6th Congressional District is emblematic of this change. Her entire life
was upended by gun violence when her son was killed with a gun for
playing his music too loudly. In a suburban district that is
predominantly white and has historically elected a Republican to
Congress, they ultimately elected Lucy, a gun safety champion. But she
wasn't alone. In the suburbs of Houston, longtime Republican
representative John Culberson, a recipient of NRA contributions and
endorsement, was toppled by Lizzie Fletcher, who made strengthening gun
laws a central part of her campaign. And in the suburbs of Dallas, civil
rights attorney and former linebacker for the Tennessee Titans, Colin
Allred---who strongly supports treating gun violence like a public
health crisis---unseated NRA-endorsed Pete Sessions. In the suburbs of
Kansas City, Sharice Davids unseated Republican incumbent Kevin Yoder
while running on a strong gun safety platform. Tragically, [gun violence
touches every corner of the country, whether it's red or blue. In the
face of Congressional inaction in the face of our gun violence crisis,
voters in even the reddest of states are ready for change.]{.underline}
As Democratic primary voters support stronger gun laws more than ever
and believe momentum is shifting in their favor, now is the time for
Democratic candidates to speak up about gun violence and improving our
gun laws.

The White House has confirmed that President Trump will be addressing
the National Rifle Association convention this weekend, as will Vice
President Pence, joiningconservative videobloggers Diamond and Silk on
the already star-studdedspeaker'slist. [While Trump has appeared at NRA
conventions before, he comes before them at a moment of greater risk for
himself --- and for the gun-rights group. And this time, Trump will
probably hurt their cause more than help it. It is unlikely that Trump's
speech itself will produce something significant, because we've seen so
many of these before.]{.underline} He arrives with a prepared speech
paying tribute to his audience and their issue, then proceeds to ramble
on for an hour about hisgreat electoral college victory, the dishonest
news media, the phony Russia investigation, and whichever liberal
happens to be annoying him that week (look out, Michelle Wolf!). That's
how his speechto the NRA last year went. But [the context is different
this year. In the wake of the Parkland,Fla., school shooting, the
politics of guns have shifted in one critical way: Democrats are no
longer afraid of the issue. The idea that the NRA wields terrifying
power before which every politician of any party must bow has been
punctured; more Democratic candidates are talking openly about new gun
control measures, and liberal organizing on the issue has increased
significantly.One ofthe president's goals in coming to the NRA
convention is to convince gun voters --- that subset of gun owners for
whom gun rights are the most important issue of all --- that they must
vote in November.]{.underline} The message is not just that if Democrats
are elected then Nancy Pelosi will personally come to your house, take
away your guns, and then invite marauding gangs of
minorities/immigrants/terrorists to kill you and defile your women,
because every speaker at the convention will say that (not quite
literally, though Wayne LaPierre might). [It's that loyalty to Trump
himself demands you vote and work to make sure Republicans win. Trump:
\'Don\'t worry about the NRA, they\'re on our side\']{.underline} But
there's a problem. [For a couple of decades, the assumption has been
that, while those who favor more restrictions on guns see it as just one
of many issues they care about, the gun rights side is full of highly
motivated activists for whom guns are the only issue]{.underline}. Even
if the second group is smaller in number, their intensity gives them
outsize power. [That may no longer be true. Recent polls have shown
those favoring restrictions are more motivated than those favoring gun
rights]{.underline}. In this recentNPR/PBS/Marist College poll, 60
percent of voters said they would definitely vote for a candidate who
wants stricter gun laws, while 33 percent said theywould definitely vote
against such a candidate. [Fifty-three percent of Democrats said a
candidate's position on guns will be a major factor in how they'll vote,
compared to only 44 percent of Republicans.]{.underline} CNN polling has
also shown a similar trend. The figure for Democrats is actually lower
than it was right after Parkland, and it could change in the next few
months --- depending on how many mass shootings we have (we'll have
some, of course, because we never go more than a few weeks without one).
[But the NRA's long-standing effort to make guns an issue of cultural
identity, as fruitful as it has been, can be a long-term problem as the
population of that culture gets smaller relative to the other side.
Perhaps more than ever, liberals are seeing a belief in limits on guns
as part of their cultural identity --- which is only reinforced when the
president they despise reminds them of his love for the
NRA.]{.underline} Gun advocates face another problem: the complacency
that sets in on the right when there's a Republican in the White House,
whichsuggeststheparadox within which the NRA always exists. The
organization and its patrons in the gun industry never do better than
when their allies are out of power and theyare able to cry "They're
coming for your guns!" But when thereis a Republican in the White House,
only the most gullible gun nuts believe it. Since Trump was elected, the
industry has experienced what some call a "Trump slump," a dramatic
slowdown in gun sales. As of yet, we don't see signs that the aftermath
of the Parkland shooting and the dramatic increase in [liberal activism
has convinced gun owners they need to be afraid of sweeping new laws.
When Trump goes to the NRA and his speech is reported in everynews
outlet, it could have more of a motivating effect on liberals than on
conservatives]{.underline}. Especially if Trump takes shots at the
Russia investigation --- and really, do you think he'll be able to help
himself? --- [it would give news organizations the opportunity to write
more about the intriguing Russia-NRA connection]{.underline}. You'll
recall that in January,we learnedthe FBI was investigating whether a
Russian banker with close ties to both the NRA and Russian President
Vladimir Putin used thegun-rights group to funnel money to the Trump
campaign. This past Friday, CNNreportedthat the NRA "is setting aside
years of documents related to its interactions with a Kremlin-linked
banker, as the gun-rights group appears to be bracing for a possible
investigation."[At another time, Trump could have gone to the NRA secure
in the knowledge that doing so would help rile his base without having
to worry too much about what kind of negative media coverage it would
produce, or what effect it would have on his opponents. But this year,
it will likely only bring him more headaches, and serve to excite those
voters eager to send him a message by voting Republicans out of
office.]{.underline} And that's before whatever crazy stuff comes out of
his mouth.

[They\'re a Blue Tidal Wave---If They Vote]{.underline} PAUL TAYLOR JUNE
17, 2019 [Today\'s teens are likely to be even more progressive than the
millennials who voted in 2018, but will they show up?]{.underline}
Camrocker/iStock This article appears under the title \"The Reluctant
Majority\" in the Summer 2019 issue of The American Prospect magazine.
Subscribe here. Brianna took me aback. She was the first to speak when I
asked students in her high school government class if they planned to
vote once they turned 18. "No way!" she said, mixing bravado with
disdain. "It would be a waste of my time! I don't feel like giving my
time to this country. "No politician is going to help me put a roof over
my head. Nobody is going to put bread on my table. Nobody is going to
take care of me. I need to take care of me." I was visiting her New York
City classroom the week before the 2018 midterm elections. All the
students were black or Hispanic. I'm an old white guy who was there
trying to understand what the next generation thinks about politics,
civics, democracy, voting, America. "What do we think, guys?" I asked.
"Is she right?" The room stayed quiet for a few beats before Chloe
weighed in, softly. "My mom says every vote counts. She says the reason
we got Trump is that too many people didn't vote. And everything he's
done since he got elected has been racist. If we get someone new, maybe
things will get better." Another round of awkward silence. The class was
like a jury mulling over two closing arguments, neither of which it
found persuasive. Luis spoke next. "America has always been racist," he
said. "With Trump, people are just more up-front about it." This drew
approving nods around the room and a thumbs-up smirk from Brianna. "When
I see white people now," she said, "they look at me like I make them
afraid." More nods. These teenagers belong to the most distinctive
coming-of-age generation in American history. [Today's old skew white
and conservative; today's young skew brown and progressive. We've never
had such a big chasm between the two. For a liberal boomer like myself,
there's much to admire about the young: their passion for social
justice, their empathy for the underdog, their celebration of racial and
gender diversity, their respect for rules, their penchant for
collaboration]{.underline}. But there are troubling signs too---a victim
mentality, an intolerance of viewpoint diversity, a distrust of
institutions, a wariness about human nature, an aversion to risk, a
cynicism about the whole American experiment. The historian Thomas
Bender wrote that "nations are, among other things, a collective
agreement, partly coerced, to affirm a common history as a basis for a
shared future." When it comes to American history, young and old agree
about almost nothing. Older adults take pride in the official version:
We're the greatest nation on earth, with noble ideals and, yes, some
messy realities. Today's teenagers learn mainly about the mess,
especially those realities stemming from our original sins, racial
oppression and slavery. Nearly half of adults over the age of 65 say
that America stands above all other countries of the world. Just 14
percent of 13-to-21-year-olds agree. [As the generations cast their gaze
forward, these perspectives flip. Teenagers are far more hopeful than
older adults about what America will become, probably because both know
the future belongs to the young. But there's no guarantee that this
coming-of-age generation will funnel its optimism into the civic habit
most likely to create a brighter future: voting. THE STAKES COULD not be
higher. In 2018, voters under age 30 favored Democratic congressional
candidates by a whopping 35 percentage points, while voters over the age
of 45 were evenly split. It was the biggest age gap ever in a midterm
election]{.underline}. Throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s,
there was often no age gap at all. And there's more to come: [Today's
teenagers are likely to be even more progressive than the millennials
who voted in 2018. For the first time ever, half of all Americans under
the age of 20 are Hispanic, black, Asian American, or mixed
race]{.underline}. They're the mosaic created by a modern immigration
wave that has brought more than 60 million newcomers here since 1965,
nearly nine in ten of them nonwhite. [For them, diversity isn't merely
demography; it's the beating heart of their value system]{.underline}.
Throughout the 20th century, "melting pot" was our go-to metaphor for an
America transformed by immigration. It no longer parses. Given their
skin color, today's immigrants and their children couldn't melt if they
wanted to. And most don't want to. They want to live in a society where
boundaries of race, gender, and sexual orientation are porous, and
everyone is free to be whoever he/she/they wants. Not a melting pot; a
"mosaic"---which is my nominee for a label for this new generation
(let's act fast before "Generation Z" gets more traction, with its
creepy intimations of end-times). [Politically and ideologically,
Mosaics are a tsunami-in-waiting. Four million will turn 18 this year.
Another four million next year.]{.underline} And so on, for as far as
the eye can see. If you're wondering why the new guard of [the
Democratic Party]{.underline} has put forward such an audacious agenda
this year---wealth tax, carbon-neutral economy, tuition-free college,
Medicare for All, universal child care, racial reparations---wonder no
more. They're [racing left to keep pace with their future base, which
wants leaders who shoot for the moon.]{.underline} According to a study
by social scientists Yair Ghitza and Andrew Gelman, the political
landscape that people encounter at age 18 leaves three times the mark on
their values and partisanship as do events they experience at age 40.
With that in mind, let's take a quick tour of what politics looks like
to most of today's high school students. The White House is occupied by
a villain from central casting who got there by riding a backlash to the
demographic changes they embody. Large chunks of the GOP establishment
and the conservative media echo chamber have become captive to a
xenophobic right-wing fringe. Meanwhile, one diverse new crop of
Democrats has planted itself noisily in Congress and another is running
for president. [Mosaics may hate politics and have no use for party
labels, but they're beginning to see their own lives, likenesses, and
values reflected in a new generation of Democratic leaders. The moon and
stars have aligned to make them a blue wave of historic proportions. If
they vote. And here's where the crystal ball grows cloudy. Even with the
"Trump bump" that took midterm voter turnout rates to their highest
levels in a century for all age groups, the rate among eligible adults
under age 25 was still barely half the rate among voters ages 45 and
older]{.underline} (32 percent versus 62 percent). As they form
families, start careers, buy houses, send their kids to school, and pay
taxes, will Mosaics start pulling their weight on Election Day?
Historical trends say yes. But what if history isn't a guide? What if
this generation's allergy to voting isn't a function of life stage only?
What if it's also the by-product of coming of age at a time when an
embittered right and aggrieved left disagree about everything else, but
lock arms around their shared conviction that politics is rigged? If
that's where the story of American democracy starts for you, why
wouldn't you stand with Brianna and take a hike on voting? For someone
like me, it's easy to rail against President Trump for conducting his
civics-lesson-in-reverse, with daily rage tweets against the courts,
Congress, the political parties, the FBI, the intelligence community,
the media, immigrants, minorities, the rule of law, and just about every
cherished democratic norm under the sun. But to the young, the woke left
also throws plenty of shade at America. Some comes from a popular
culture that often seems fixated on our deepest moral
failings---witness, for example, the three Grammy Awards and 500 million
YouTube views taken in by "This Is America," the 2018 rap video that
intersperses joyful singing and dancing with shocking images of blacks
being gunned down. And some comes from an education establishment that
can take political correctness to self-parodying excesses---as when the
University of California advises faculty members to avoid phrases like
"America is the land of opportunity" because they might be seen as a
microaggression. These days, there are a dwindling number of college
courses that explore the majesty of the Bill of Rights or the genius of
checks and balances. "Ten years ago I could teach Madison," says Peter
Levine, a professor of citizenship and public affairs at Tufts
University. "Now I can't because the only thing my students are
interested in is slavery." Levine helped launch and for a decade ran
CIRCLE, a nonprofit research group that tracks youth civic engagement
and voting. "I have complicated feelings about where we are now," he
says. "Lots of Americans, especially African Americans, have reason to
read our history in a jaundiced way. But the worry is that you create a
narrative for the next generation that says this country is too deeply
racist and sexist to ever fix itself." Some data points illuminate the
challenge: The Young Don't Put Voting on a Pedestal. Nine in ten older
adults say voting is essential to citizenship. Just 56 percent of
18-to-29-year-olds agree, according to a 2018 Pew Research survey. Their
Diversity Might Not Draw Them to the Voting Booths. The historic turnout
gap between blacks and whites closed during Barack Obama's two
presidential campaigns but opened back up in 2016, due mainly to a
decline in turnout by younger blacks. Among Mosaics, blacks aren't the
largest minority group; Hispanics are. And here the turnout prospects
are even more problematic. Election after election, Hispanic turnout
rates lag about 20 percentage points behind those of whites. They're Not
All-In on Patriotism. Just a third of 18-to-29-year-olds say they are
extremely proud Americans, compared with nearly six in ten adults ages
50 and older, according to a 2018 Gallup survey. They Don't Trust
Government. Today, just 20 percent of teenagers and young
twenty-somethings say they trust the government in Washington, D.C., to
do what's right. Back when baby boomers were that same age, 73 percent
of them trusted the government to do what's right. They Don't Trust
People. Over the past half-century, the American public, young as well
as old, has been hemorrhaging confidence in nearly all major
institutions of society. But among the young, there's something else
even more daunting: They also don't trust other human beings. Just 24
percent of Mosaics say most people can be trusted. Together with the
young adults of the millennial generation, they register the lowest
scores for interpersonal trust in the half-century that this topic has
been explored by the General Social Survey. The drought in social trust
among the young is especially worrisome. In a fast-paced entrepreneurial
economy, trust is the grease that keeps the gears from grinding. In an
increasingly pluralistic society, it's the glue that holds the mosaic
together. In a self-governing democracy, it's a rationale for voting and
predicate for pragmatic compromise. Why are Mosaics so distrustful?
There's an oversupply of explanations. A record share are minorities,
and in all societies, minority groups tend to be less trusting. In their
young lives, many have been given "the talk"---guidance from protective
parents (but also popular culture, personal experience, and street
wisdom) that cops, courts, pols, and even priests aren't on their side.
They've grown up doing lockdown drills in school, wondering if that
strange kid from fourth period might be the next mass shooter. And they
spend tons of time on social media, where it takes a nanosecond to
figure out that not all their friends really are their friends. So how
do you persuade Brianna and her classmates that America is worth a vote?
[Ultimately this is a job for candidates and campaigns, and there's a
good chance that 2020 will serve up a stark enough choice to energize
the youth vote. But at a time when politics is stuck in a doom
loop]{.underline} of mutual provocation, reciprocal outrage, and
relentless cynicism, [it would help to have the backstop of a robust
civic culture that promotes the habit of voting.]{.underline}

### Saudi Arabia

#### Saudi Arabia supports arms and has a powerful lobby- influences politics and elections

EMMA **ASHFORD in 2018**

A Guide to Saudi Arabia's Influence in Washington, The New Republic,
<https://newrepublic.com/article/152547/guide-saudi-arabias-influence-washington>

[The administration has displayed unwavering support for the Saudi-led
war in Yemen]{.underline}, an ongoing humanitarian disaster. [It
continues to arm and aid the Saudi-led coalition,]{.underline} despite
repeated reports of Saudi war crimes. Even the recent decision to end
refueling support for the campaign came only after sustained
congressional and public pressure, and the threat of a congressional
rebuke on the topic. Indeed, the administration has actively worked with
congressional leadership to shut down bills that would end U.S. support
for the conflict. [Arms sales are another area where the Gulf States
have benefited during the Trump administration]{.underline}. Though the
president himself likes to portray such sales as vital to the United
States economy, the actual financial and job-related benefits are small.
Instead, these sales are hugely beneficial to the Saudi government,
allowing them access advanced weapons and to replenish armament stocks.
Recent reports suggest that Kushner even pushed to inflate the reported
value of arms sales to the Kingdom in order to further bolster the
partnership. Perhaps the most striking indication of the
administration's excessive willingness to bend to Saudi interests is in
its refusal to criticize the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post
columnist and U.S. resident killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
In any other administration, this action would have drawn clear
condemnation and policy response. In the Trump era, the administration
has displayed skepticism towards its own intelligence agencies, while
maintaining its support for Saudi leaders. To what extent were any of
these decisions the direct result of money and influence from the Gulf
States? It's impossible to say. For starters, we may never know the
extent of the financial ties between Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Trump's
businesses, family, and donors. Though Mueller's report may eventually
clarify some of these questions, much of it lies outside the expected
scope of the investigation. It's unclear whether other lawsuits---such
as one targeting Trump's businesses as violating the emoluments clause
of the constitution---will be successful in subpoenaing records on this
question. More importantly, though, i[t's difficult to distinguish
influence during the Trump administration from general attempts by these
states to buy policymaking influence here in D.C.]{.underline} As a
recent report from the Center for International Policy (CIP)
illustrated, [Saudi lobbying in Washington has grown exponentially in
recent years, costing \$27.3 million in 2017 alone.]{.underline} [In
addition to the money that goes to traditional lobbyists, Saudi funding
goes to think tanks, universities, and other institutions which can
influence U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. **[Despite rules on foreign
election funding, at least some of that money even goes to
politicians]{.underline}**: The CIP report suggests that [more than
one-third of the congressmen contacted by lobbying firms]{.underline}
like the Glover Park Group or DLA Piper [on behalf of Saudi Arabia later
received a campaign contribution from a registered foreign agent at the
firm---i]{.underline}n other words, a U.S. citizen, but one paid by a
foreign government. As the report notes, "**[while it's true that
foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions to political
campaigns, there's a simple work-around, one the Saudis obviously made
use of big time ... just hire a local lobbyist to do it for
them."]{.underline}**

#### Pro Saudi influence is strong in US campaigns- massive donations

Report Says Saudi-hired Lobbyists Give Millions to Influence US
Congress, VOA,
<https://www.voanews.com/usa/report-says-saudi-hired-lobbyists-give-millions-influence-us-congress>

U[.S. lobbyists on Saudi Arabia\'s payroll gave more than \$2.3 million
to U.S. political campaigns in late 2016 and 2017]{.underline} **[as
they mounted a massive influence operation to]{.underline}** blunt
anti-Saudi congressional action and **[promote other Saudi interests in
the United States]{.underline}**, according to a new study of federal
lobbying records. The analysis of 2017 Foreign Agents Registration Act
filings conducted by the Center for International Policy found that
[while a quarter of the money was given to political action committees,
more than \$1.5 million of the contributions were funneled to individual
campaigns]{.underline}, with nearly \$400,000 going to 75 members of
Congress whom the lobbyists contacted on behalf of Saudi Arabia. Among
members of Congress, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House Majority
Leader, was the top Republican recipient of campaign donations from the
Saudi lobbyists while Senator Bill Nelson was the top recipient on the
Democratic side. [In 12 instances, members, both Republican and
Democratic, received campaign contributions on the same day their
offices were contacted by the Saudi lobbyists,]{.underline} in many
cases about pending legislation that would allow victims of the 9/11
attacks on the United States to sue Saudi Arabia. The members included
Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee; Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee; and Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Democrat who chairs
the Congressional Black Caucus. "What we've seen in our research is that
**[Saudi lobbyists did this repeatedly in 2017...and I'd imagine Saudi
lobbyists are doing this right now]{.underline}**," said Ben Freeman,
director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative and author of
the report.

[The Saudis have poured money into lobbying for decades, but the numbers

According to data compiled by the Center for International Policy, a

had nearly tripled, increasing to almost \$27 million.]{.underline} Dr.

#### Trump needs to maintain a hardline on China to shore up his base strategy for re-election

Mark **Landler and** Ana **Swanson 5/10/19**

The New York Times, Trump Sees a China Trade Deal Through a New Prism:
The 2020 Election,
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/trump-china-trade-2020-election.html

When President [Trump]{.underline} had finished mocking the field of
Democratic presidential candidates at a rally in Florida this week
("Sleepy Joe," "Crazy Bernie" and "Boot-edge-edge"), he [pivoted
abruptly to]{.underline} his intensifying trade war with
[China]{.underline}. **[The segue was no accident: Mr. Trump is
determined to present himself as tougher on the Chinese than any of his
potential challengers in 2020.]{.underline}** "Representing us against
President Xi of China," a sarcastic Mr. Trump said of Pete Buttigieg,
the young mayor of South Bend, Ind. "That'd be great." Taking aim at
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. earlier in the day, he said
that China had pulled back from a trade deal because it wanted to wait
him out and negotiate with a President Biden or "one of the very weak
Democrats, and thereby continue to rip off the United States."
[Election-year politics have crept]{.underline} [in]{.underline}to Mr.
Trump's trade policy. For months, the prospect of a landmark trade
agreement with China has tantalized Mr. Trump. But now, according to
analysts and several former aides, [his political calculus seems to have
flipped. His recent statements suggest he now believes that
demonstrating his **toughness with the Chinese**]{.underline} and
walking away from a deal **[might well put him in a better position
politically than signing one]{.underline}**. Imposing new tariffs on
China is likely to hurt American farmers, rattle the stock market and
possibly damage the economy. But signing an agreement could expose Mr.
Trump to attacks by Democrats, particularly if it is perceived as weak.
[A hard line]{.underline}, on the other hand, **[would allow the
president to cater to his political base while heading off any
Democratic attempts to outflank him as the great protector of American
workers]{.underline}**. "[The days of being soft on China are
over,"]{.underline} said Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief
strategist for Mr. Trump, who shaped the economic message of his 2016
campaign and has warned repeatedly about the dangers posed by China.
"[Politics now drives the economics]{.underline}."

#### Trump needs hawkish stance on China to use against the Democrats- key 2020 strategy

Tom **Porter 5/10/19**

Trump doesn\'t seem worried about the collapse of the China trade deal,
and it could be because it gives him a way to attack Biden, Business
Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-could-welcome-china-deal-collapse-as-opportunity-to-attack-biden-2019-5

President Donald [Trump placed his]{.underline} escalating [trade war
with China at the heart of his battle to defeat the Democrats in
2020]{.underline} in a tweet Friday, which could hint at a longer-term
strategy to use the conflict for domestic ends. \"Tariffs will make our
Country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch! In the
meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S. at the last
minute,\" Trump tweeted. \"This is not the Obama Administration, or the
Administration of Sleepy Joe, who let China get away with \'murder!\'\"
On Sunday Trump announced that he would escalate tariffs on \$200
billion of Chinese goods, just when a deal between Chinese and US
negotiators appeared imminent. Some commentators saw the threat as a
classic move from the Trump playbook - designed to pressurize Beijing
into closing the deal. News reports have also suggested that China
genuinely reneged on large parts of its previous commitments at the last
minute, forcing Trump\'s hand. [With no deal in place despite last-ditch
talks in Washington Thursday, Trump followed through on the threat,
imposing tariffs]{.underline} on billions of dollars of Chinese
manufactured goods including vacuum cleaners, modems and car parts. As
his Friday tweet hints, though, **[far from being anxious]{.underline}**
about the stalled negotiations, **[Trump appears to see a chance for
political capital to be made]{.underline}**. Specifically, [it could
give the president a chance to dent the hopes of Joe Biden]{.underline},
the Democrat he sees as his chief rival for the presidency in 2020. An
outside adviser to the Trump campaign, speaking on condition of
anonymity to The Atlantic on Wednesday, said that **[the absence of
trade deal actually places Trump in a better position heading into the
2020 campaign.]{.underline}** \"**[What Democrat now is going to be able
to out-hawk Trump on China? Whereas if he\'d signed a deal that was
weak, those candidates would have ammunition.\"]{.underline}** \"[The
fight is more important than the resolution]{.underline},\" said the
official. \"So, yes, we want good policy; we want to get a good trade
deal with China. But politically, I\'d argue it\'s almost better if we
don\'t.\"

#### Trump reelection would be catastrophic -- the irreversibility of climate change, arms races, and nuclear war prove

**Starr '19** (Paul, Professor of sociology and public affairs at
Princeton University, "Trump's Second Term," The Atlantic, May 15 2019,
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/trump-2020-second-term/585994/)/ly

So far, much of the concern about the long-term effects of Trump's
presidency has centered on his antidemocratic tendencies. But even if we
take those off the table---even if we assume that Trump continues to be
hemmed in by other parts of the government and by outside institutions,
and that he governs no more effectively than he has until now---[the
impact of a second term would be more lasting]{.underline} than that of
the first. In normal politics, the policies adopted by a president and
Congress may zig one way, and those of the next president and Congress
may zag the other. The contending parties take our system's rules as a
given, and fight over what they understand to be reversible policies and
power arrangements. But some situations are not like that; a zig one way
makes it hard to zag back. This is one of those moments. After four
years as president, [Trump will have made at least two Supreme Court
appointments, signed into law tax cuts, and rolled back federal
regulation of the environment and the economy]{.underline}. Whatever you
think of these actions, many of them can probably be offset or entirely
undone in the future. [The effects of a full eight years]{.underline} of
Trump [will be]{.underline} much more difficult, if not [impossible, to
undo]{.underline}. Three areas---**[climate change]{.underline}**,
**[the risk of a]{.underline}** renewed **[global arms
race,]{.underline}** **[and control of the Supreme
Court]{.underline}**---[illustrate the]{.underline} historic
[significance of the 2020 election]{.underline}. The first two problems
will become much harder to address as time goes on. The third one stands
to remake our constitutional democracy and undermine the capacity for
future change. In short, [the biggest difference]{.underline} between
electing Trump [in]{.underline} 2016 and [reelecting Trump]{.underline}
in 2020 [would be irreversibility]{.underline}. Climate policy is now
the most obvious example. For a long time, even many of the people who
acknowledged the reality of climate change thought of it as a slow
process that did not demand immediate action. But today, amid extreme
weather events and worsening scientific forecasts, the costs of our
delay are clearly mounting, as are the associated dangers. [To have a
chance at keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees]{.underline}
Celsius---[the objective of the Paris climate
agreement]{.underline}---the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
says that [by 2030, CO2 emissions must drop]{.underline} some [45
percent]{.underline} from 2010 levels. Instead of declining, however,
they are rising. In his first term, [Trump has announced plans to cancel
existing climate reforms]{.underline}, [such as higher fuel-efficiency
standards and limits on emissions from new coal-fired power
plants]{.underline}, and he has pledged to pull the United States out of
the Paris Agreement. [His reelection would put off a national commitment
to decarbonization]{.underline} until at least the second half of the
2020s, while encouraging other countries to do nothing as well. And
change that is delayed becomes more economically and politically
difficult. According to the Global Carbon Project, if decarbonization
had begun globally in 2000, an emissions reduction of about 2 percent a
year would have been sufficient to stay below 2 degrees Celsius of
warming. Now it will need to be approximately 5 percent a year. If we
wait another decade, it will be about 9 percent. In the United States,
the economic disruption and popular resistance sure to arise from such
an abrupt transition may be more than our political system can bear. No
one knows, moreover, when the world might hit irreversible tipping
points such as the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would
likely doom us to a catastrophic sea-level rise. [The]{.underline} [2020
election will]{.underline} also [determine]{.underline} whether the U.S.
continues on a course that all but guarantees another kind of runaway
global change---[a stepped-up arms race]{.underline}, and
[with]{.underline} it [a heightened risk of]{.underline} nuclear
accidents and [nuclear war]{.underline}. [Trump's "America first"
doctrine, attacks]{.underline} on America's [alliances, and]{.underline}
unilateral [withdrawal from arms-control treaties have made]{.underline}
[the world]{.underline} far more [dangerous.]{.underline} After pulling
the United States out of the Iran nuclear agreement (in so doing, badly
damaging America's reputation as both an ally and a negotiating
partner), Trump failed to secure from North Korea anything approaching
the Iran deal's terms, leaving Kim Jong Un not only unchecked but with
increased international standing. Many world leaders are hoping that
Trump's presidency is a blip---that he will lose in 2020, and that his
successor will renew America's commitments to its allies and to the
principles of multilateralism and nonproliferation. [If he is
reelected]{.underline}, however, [several countries may opt to pursue
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [especially]{.underline} those
[in]{.underline} regions that have relied on American security
guarantees, such as [the Middle East and Northeast Asia.]{.underline}
[At stake is the global nonproliferation regime]{.underline} that the
United States and other countries have maintained over the past several
decades to persuade nonnuclear powers to stay that way. That this regime
has largely succeeded is a tribute to a combination of tactics,
including U.S. bilateral and alliance-based defense commitments to
nonnuclear countries, punishments and incentives, and pledges by the
U.S. and Russia---as the world's leading nuclear powers---to make
dramatic cuts to their own arsenals. In his first term, Trump has begun
to undermine the nonproliferation regime and dismantle the remaining
arms-control treaties between Washington and Moscow. In October, [he
announced that the U.S. would withdraw from]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces ([INF]{.underline})
Treaty signed in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. While the
Russian violations of the treaty that Trump cited are inexcusable, he
has made no effort to hold Russia to its obligations---to the contrary,
[by destroying the treaty, he has let Russia off the hook]{.underline}.
What's more, he has displayed no interest in extending New START, which
since 2011 has limited the strategic nuclear arsenals of Russia and the
United States. If the treaty is allowed to expire, 2021 will mark the
first year since 1972 [without a legally binding agreement]{.underline}
in place [to control]{.underline} and reduce [the deadliest
arsenals]{.underline} ever created. [The prospect of a new nuclear arms
race is]{.underline} suddenly very [real]{.underline}. With the end of
verifiable limits on American and Russian nuclear weapons, both
countries will lose the right to inspect each other's arsenal, and will
face greater uncertainty about each other's capabilities and intentions.
Already, rhetoric has taken an ominous turn: After Trump suspended U.S.
participation in the INF Treaty on February 2, Vladimir Putin quickly
followed suit and promised a "symmetrical response" to new American
weapons. Trump replied a few days later in his State of the Union
address, threatening to "outspend and out-innovate all others by far" in
weapons development.

[Could Donald Trump refuse to leave office when his presidency is
up?]{.underline} The US leader's latest praise for an authoritarian
power grab is made scarier by not being an isolated incident. BY MEHDI
HASAN Donald Trump PHOTO: GETTY Sign Up Get the New Statesman's Morning
Call email. SIGN-UP [He's now president for life," Donald Trump told a
closed-door meeting of Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago resort on 3
March, referring to the Chinese government's decision to abolish term
limits and allow President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely. "And look,
he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give
that a shot some day."]{.underline} Is this the "scariest thing Donald
Trump has said as president", to quote a headline on the CNN website?
Was this Trump not just endorsing but envying a model of dictatorship?
Or was he just joking? To be fair, the US president was smiling and
there were laughs from the audience. So it was all tongue-in-cheek,
right? Right? Perhaps not. "[Authoritarians and aspiring authoritarians
often 'joke' about power grabs or autocratic behaviour as a 'trial
balloon' to gauge public reaction]{.underline}," says Brian Klaas, an
American political scientist who specialises in authoritarianism and
political violence, and is author of the recent book, The Despot's
Apprentice: Donald Trump's Attack on Democracy. Klaas has a point:
Trump's fellow populist, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, "joked"
about assassinating reporters when he came to office in 2016. Today, the
Philippines ranks as one of the most dangerous countries in the world in
which to be a journalist. [The US president's praise for an
authoritarian power grab isn't an isolated incident, Klass tells me. "It
wasn't a joke. It was a window into a man who values strongmen over
democratic institutions and has exhibited that trait for years." Trump
has form when it comes to praising dictators, despots and
autocrats]{.underline}: from Russia's Vladimir Putin ("He's been a
leader, far more than \[Barack Obama\] has been a leader"); to Egypt's
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ("He's done a fantastic job in a very difficult
situation"); to Duterte ("I just wanted to congratulate you because I am
hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem"). In an interview
with Playboy magazine back in 1990, the then property tycoon hailed the
Chinese Communist Party's murderous response to the Tiananmen Square
protests. "They were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down
with strength. That shows you the power of strength." In contrast, Trump
added, "our country is right now perceived as weak". Other US presidents
have cosied up to tyrants -- think Bill Clinton and Hosni Mubarak or
George W Bush and the Saudis -- but few have done so as proudly as the
current occupant of the Oval Office. [Then there is Trump's domestic
record. Political scientists agree that authoritarian or illiberal rule
is not only the result of military coups or tanks on the streets.
Rather, the slow erosion of democratic norms can also open the door to
creeping authoritarianism. Wittingly or unwittingly, Trump has borrowed
from the playbook of every successful autocrat of the modern
era.]{.underline} Consider the evidence. [Undermine the rule of law and
the independence of the judiciary? Check]{.underline}. Trump has
attacked "so-called" judges who have ruled against him while tweeting
that a New York terror suspect "SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY". [Politicise
law enforcement and the security services? Check]{.underline}. Trump
fired FBI chief James Comey, tried to sack special counsel Robert
Mueller and now wants to remove his attorney general, Jeff Sessions.
[Demonise the free press? Check.]{.underline} Trump has repeatedly
lambasted his critics in the media as "fake news", "scum" and "losers".
He has dubbed leading news organisations such as CNN and the New York
Times as "the enemy of the American people". [Fetishise the military?
Check]{.underline}. Trump has surrounded himself with unelected former
generals -- his chief of staff and his defence secretary, among them --
and even demanded a military parade be held in Washington, DC.
[Delegitimise the electoral process? Check]{.underline}. Trump has
claimed that "millions of people... voted illegally" for his opponent
and has spread false claims about "serious voter fraud" in the United
States. [Criminalise the opposition? Trump has pressured the justice
department to investigate his 2016 opponent, "Crooked" Hillary Clinton,
and called for the jailing of her former aide Huma Abedin. The
normalisation of this behaviour is perhaps the single biggest threat to
American democracy -- because it could outlast Trump's
presidency.]{.underline} "Previously unthinkable attacks on the press
and calls to jail political rivals have become routine," says Klaas.
"That will have lasting consequences even if checks and balances were
functioning properly, because 30 to 40 per cent of voters are not just
OK with authoritarian populism; they actually applaud it."

### Climate !

#### Reelection allows trump to cancel vital climate reform policies

So far, much of the concern about the long-term effects of Trump's
presidency has centered on his antidemocratic tendencies. But even if we
take those off the table---[even if we assume that Trump continues to be
hemmed in by other parts of the government and by outside institutions,
and that he governs no more effectively than he has until now---the
impact of a second term would be more lasting than that of the
first.]{.underline} In normal politics, the policies adopted by a
president and Congress may zig one way, and those of the next president
and Congress may zag the other. The contending parties take our system's
rules as a given, and fight over what they understand to be reversible
policies and power arrangements. But some situations are not like that;
a zig one way makes it hard to zag back. This is one of those moments.
[After four years as president, Trump will have made at least two
Supreme Court appointments, signed into law tax cuts, and rolled back
federal regulation of the environment and the economy.]{.underline}
Whatever you think of these actions, many of them can probably be offset
or entirely undone in the future. [The effects of a full eight years of
Trump will be much more difficult, if not impossible, to undo. Three
areas---climate change, the risk of a renewed global arms race, and
control of the Supreme Court---illustrate the historic significance of
the 2020 election. The first two problems will become much harder to
address as time goes on.]{.underline} The third one stands to remake our
constitutional democracy and undermine the capacity for future change.
In short, the biggest difference between electing Trump in 2016 and
[reelecting Trump in 2020 would be irreversibility. Climate policy is
now the most obvious example. For a long time, even many of the people
who acknowledged the reality of climate change thought of it as a slow
process that did not demand immediate action. But today, amid extreme
weather events and worsening scientific forecasts, the costs of our
delay are clearly mounting, as are the associated dangers. To have a
chance at keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius---the
objective of the Paris climate agreement---the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change says that by 2030, CO2 emissions must drop some 45
percent from 2010 levels. Instead of declining, however, they are
rising.]{.underline} In his first term, [Trump has announced plans to
cancel existing climate reforms, such as higher fuel-efficiency
standards and limits on emissions from new coal-fired power plants, and
he has pledged to pull the United States out of the Paris
Agreement.]{.underline} [His reelection would put off a national
commitment to decarbonization until at least the second half of the
2020s, while encouraging other countries to do nothing]{.underline} as
well. And change that is delayed becomes more economically and
politically difficult. According to the Global Carbon Project, [if
decarbonization had begun globally in 2000, an emissions reduction of
about 2 percent a year would have been sufficient to stay below 2
degrees Celsius of warming. Now it will need to be approximately 5
percent a year. If we wait another decade, it will be about 9 percent.
In the United States, the economic disruption and popular resistance
sure to arise from such an abrupt transition may be more than our
political system can bear. No one knows, moreover, when the world might
hit irreversible tipping points such as the collapse of the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would likely doom us to a catastrophic
sea-level rise.]{.underline}

#### Climate change leads to domino effect -- extinction 

**Flinders University 18** (Flinders university, "Climate change risks
\'extinction domino effect\'". Science daily. November 29^th^, 2018.
<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181129122506.htm)> kb

[New research reveals the extinction of plant or animal species from
extreme environmental change increases the risk of an \'extinction
domino effect\' that could annihilate all life on Earth. This would be
the worst-case scenario of what scientists call \'co-extinctions\',
where an organism dies out because it depends on another doomed species,
with the findings published today in the journal Scientific
Reports.]{.underline} Think of a plant\'s flower pollinated by only one
species of bee \-- if the bee becomes extinct, so too will the plant
eventually. [\"Even the most resilient species will inevitably fall
victim to the synergies among extinction drivers as extreme stresses
drive ecosystems to collapse.\"]{.underline} says lead author Dr
Giovanni Strona of the European Commission\'s Joint Research Centre
based in Ispra in northern Italy. [Researchers]{.underline} from Italy
and Australia [simulated 2,000 \'virtual earths\' linking animal and
plant species. Using sophisticated modelling, they subjected the virtual
earths to catastrophic environmental changes that ultimately annihilated
all life.]{.underline} Examples of the kinds of catastrophes they
simulated included runaway global warming, scenarios of \'nuclear
winter\' following the detonation of multiple atomic bombs, and a large
asteroid impact. \"What we were trying to test is whether the variable
tolerances to extreme global heating or cooling by different species are
enough to explain overall extinction rates,\" \"But because all species
are connected in the web of life, our paper demonstrates that [even the
most tolerant species ultimately succumb to extinction when the
less-tolerant species on which they depend disappear]{.underline}.\"
\"Failing to take into account these co-extinctions therefore
underestimates the rate and magnitude of the loss of entire species from
events like climate change by up to 10 times,\" says co-author Professor
Bradshaw of Flinders University in South Australia Professor Bradshaw
and Dr Strona say that [their virtual scenarios warn humanity not to
underestimate the impact of co-extinctions]{.underline}. \"[Not taking
into account this domino effect gives an unrealistic and exceedingly
optimistic perspective about the impact of future climate
change,]{.underline}\" warns Professor Bradshaw. It can be hard to
imagine how the demise of a small animal or plant matters so much, but
the authors argue that tracking species up to total annihilation
demonstrates how the loss of one can amplify the effects of
environmental change on the remainder. \"Another really important
discovery was that [in the case of global warming in particular, the
combination of intolerance to heat combined with co-extinctions mean
that 5-6 degrees of average warming globally is enough to wipe out most
life on the planet]{.underline},\" says Dr Strona. Professor Bradshaw
further warns that their work shows how [climate warming creates
extinction cascades in the worst possible way, when compared to random
extinctions or even from the stresses arising from nuclear
winter.]{.underline}

Finally, [a second term for Trump would entrench changes at home,
perhaps the most durable of which involves the Supreme
Court]{.underline}. With a full eight years, [he would probably have the
opportunity to replace two more justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be 87
at the beginning of the next presidential term, and Stephen Breyer will
be 82.]{.underline} Whether you regard the prospect of four
Trump-appointed justices as a good or a bad thing will depend on your
politics and preferences---but [there is no denying that the impact on
the nation's highest court would be momentous. Not since Richard Nixon
has a president named four new Supreme Court justices, and not since
Franklin D. Roosevelt has one had the opportunity to alter the Court's
ideological balance so decisively.]{.underline} In Nixon's time,
conservatives did not approach court vacancies with a clear conception
of their judicial objectives or with carefully vetted candidates; both
Nixon and Gerald Ford appointed justices who ended up on the Court's
liberal wing. [Since then, however, the conservative movement has built
a formidable legal network designed to ensure that future judicial
vacancies would not be squandered.]{.underline} The justices nominated
by recent Republican presidents reflect this shift. But because the
Court's conservative majorities have remained slim, a series of
Republican appointees---Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and most
recently John Roberts---have, by occasionally breaking ranks, held the
Court back from a full-scale reversal of liberal principles and
precedents. [With a 7--2 rather than a 5--4 majority, however, the
Court's conservatives could no longer be checked by a lone swing
vote.]{.underline} Much of the public discussion about the Court's
future focuses on Roe v. Wade and other decisions expanding rights,
protecting free speech, or mandating separation of Church and state.
Much less public attention has been paid to conservative activists'
interest in reversing precedents that since the New Deal era have
enabled the federal government to regulate labor and the economy. In the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, conservative justices regularly
struck down laws and regulations such as limits on work hours. Only in
1937, after ruling major New Deal programs unconstitutional, did the
[Court uphold a state minimum-wage law. In the decades that followed,
the Court invoked the Constitution's commerce clause, which authorizes
Congress to regulate interstate commerce, as the basis for upholding
laws regulating virtually any activity affecting the economy. A great
deal of federal law, from labor standards to the Civil Rights Act of
1964 to health and environmental regulation, rests on that
foundation.]{.underline}

[Think of all the important moments when Congress has meaningfully
checked abuses by the executive branch]{.underline}: Watergate, the 1975
Church Committee on wide-ranging domestic spying abuses by the CIA and
the FBI, the Iran-Contra hearings. These were all moments of divided
government, with Democrats in Congress and Republicans in the White
House. Also note: The only two impeachment votes taken in Congress
(Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998-'99) came when Republicans
controlled Congress and Democrats controlled the White House. [None of
these notable separation of powers moments would have taken place under
unified government. One might partially object to the above statement,
and note that the courts, the third branch, have checked some of the
Trump administration's plans, notably the travel ban. But primarily, it
has been liberal justices challenging the Trump administration. The
conservative Supreme Court gave the administration the thumbs-up on the
ban. And if the Trump administration succeeds in its efforts to remake
the courts by appointing conservative justices, does anybody expect them
to challenge the administration? The courts are more polarized than ever
too.]{.underline}

and Russia beginning in the 1980s have resulted in the elimination of
nearly 90 percent of their nuclear weapons; the end of the Cold War
seemed to confirm that those weapons had limited military utility.
Now---as the U.S. and Russia abandon their commitment to arms control,
and Trump's "America first" approach causes countries such as Japan and
Saudi Arabia to question the durability of U.S. security
guarantees---[the stage is being set for more states to go nuclear and
for the U.S. and Russia to ramp up weapons development. This
breathtaking historical reversal would, like global warming, likely feed
on itself, becoming more and more difficult to undo.]{.underline}

[2021 Could Be a Nightmare for Democrats --- Even If Trump
Loses]{.underline} By Eric Levitz@EricLevitz Nightmare creature. Photo:
Drew Angerer/Getty Images Winter has come. The air stings your skin as
you shuffle toward the National Mall. But there are scattered patches of
blue in the sky, and sunlight peeking out from behind a cloud. And the
crowd that now surrounds you is alive with good cheer. Your fellow
Americans are high off civic pride, or their proximity to future
history, or possibly marijuana (your nose is stuffy, but you think you
think can smell a trace of something skunky on the wind). He emerges
from the Capitol Building. The crowd goes wild. You join their cheer,
but can't make out your own voice above the din. And now you're not even
sure what it is they're chanting. But you know their words are not your
own. You look up at the nearest television monitor and there it is ---
that awful, orange face. It all comes back to you in an instant, the
flashing images in your mind alternating with the crowd's chant, like
light and darkness beneath a strobe lamp: LOCK HER UP; the Upshot's
needle swinging blue to red; LOCK HER UP; those last 10,000 votes in
Waukesha County; LOCK HER UP; the headlines heralding RBG's death right
before Christmas; LOCK HER UP; Supreme Court Justice Sarah Huckabee
Sanders; LOCK HER UP; the bombs already falling over Tehran; LOCK HER
UP; the president's face as he signed "The Voting Wrongs Act of 2021";
LOCK HER UP; Elizabeth Warren being led to a squad car in handcuffs;
LOCK HER UP; and now, as they turn toward you, their red hats glowing in
the winter sun, you realize that you are her, this place is a prison ---
and your sentence is another four years to life. [Liberals are
well-prepared for this kind of "2021 nightmare." They've been fearing it
since November 9, 2016. To avert such a terror, they took to the streets
in historic numbers the day after Donald Trump's inauguration, and
showed up at the polls en masse last fall. And they're right to be
afraid]{.underline}. Each day, Trump grows a bit more lawless, and the
Executive branch a bit less willing to defy him. Another four years of
judicial appointments would give the conservative movement a hammerlock
on the judiciary for a generation. And in that time, Trump's judges
could rubber-stamp changes to election laws that further erode what
remains of popular sovereignty in this republic --- and the world's most
powerful nation would stumble four years closer to climate catastrophe.
[Trump's reelection would be a nightmare. But for Democrats, defeating
him and winning the presidency in 2021 could be its own kind of horror
show.]{.underline} A president in shackles. [If a Democrat wins the
presidency next year, there's a good chance he or she won't be able to
do much of anything without Mitch McConnell's permission. Right now, the
odds of Team Blue winning control of the Senate next year are slim, and
getting slimmer. Democrats will need a net gain of three seats next
November to wrest the upper chamber from Mitch McConnell's
caucus.]{.underline} And while Republicans will have 22 of their
incumbents on the ballot in 2020, only two of those represent states
that have leaned Democratic in the past two presidential elections ---
Colorado and Maine. Which is less than ideal, since winning Maine will
(almost certainly) require beating Susan Collins, who has held her seat
for more than two decades, and remains quite popular with her
constituents (including many of the state's Democrats). Thus, there is
no reason to assume Democrats will be able to win the only two
blue-state seats on the board. But let's be generous and say they do.
Unless Alabama Republicans decide to make a theocratic ephebophile their
standard-bearer again (which is highly unlikely), Doug Jones will be
evicted from the Senate next November. In a presidential election year
and an age of straight-ticket voting, even Roy Moore would have a decent
shot of beating a Democrat in the Heart of Dixie. Even with wins in
Colorado and Maine, Team Blue would have only netted one seat, which
means they'd have to flip two in light-red territory. CNN's Harry Enten
explains why that's unlikely: Beyond \[Colorado and Maine\], the
Democratic pickup opportunities slim dramatically. Of the other 20
Republican-held seats up for election, 16 of them are in states that
were 10 points or more Republican than the nation as a whole in a
weighted average of the last two presidential elections. None of these
races look competitive at this time. The other four have leaned 5 to 10
points more Republican than the nation in a weighted average of the last
two presidential elections: Arizona (Martha McSally), Georgia (David
Perdue), Iowa (Joni Ernst) and North Carolina (Thom Tillis). ... Elected
Republican incumbents are, at this point, expected to be running for all
these seats, except for Arizona. Generally, incumbents tend to do better
than non-incumbents. Even if the 2018 political environment were in
effect (i.e. one where they won the national House vote by high single
digits), the lean of each state in the 2018 House elections suggests
that only Arizona (because McSally wasn't elected) would go to the
Democrats. [In other words, even if Democrats win the national popular
vote in a 2018-esque landslide, chances are they'll come up at least one
seat short. And did I mention that the party's best prospective Senate
candidates in Georgia, and the "reach" states of Texas and Montana, have
all ostensibly decided to launch far-fetched presidential campaigns,
instead?]{.underline} Or that Joe Manchin is seriously considering
resigning his seat to run for governor in West Virginia, in which case,
Democrats will effectively need to flip five seats after they (almost
certainly) forfeit the Mountain State and Alabama? Anything's possible,
of course. Democrats could find stellar candidates in every
quasi-competitive state. Far-right weirdos could win GOP primaries in
all the right places. Millennials could show up at the polls in 2020 in
unprecedented force, and remake America's electoral math in their image.
[But odds are, if a Democrat moves into the Oval Office in 2021, he or
she will be faced with a Republican Senate. Which means that he or she
will not have the power to appoint any Supreme Court justices or, in all
probability, left-leaning federal judges of any kind. And do you really
think Senate Republicans are going to help President Elizabeth Warren
install her preferred leaders atop the Treasury or SEC? Imagine a
Democratic president who isn't just too weak to advance any of the
ambitious legislation she promised her base, but also to rebalance the
courts or effectively implement her regulatory agenda. Might this dampen
Democratic voters' enthusiasm for electoral politics when the midterms
come around? A recession that discredits the progressive agenda before
Democrats even get to enact it.]{.underline} In a February survey
conducted by the National Association for Business Economics, 75 percent
of economists predicted the U.S. economy would slide into recession by
the end of 2021, with 42 percent expecting a downturn next year, and 25
percent the following one. Since that poll was taken, the Federal
Reserve backed away from rate hikes, and markets soared. And (since
expansions never last forever under capitalism) the odds of the economy
going south in 2021 are now higher than ever. [If the bubbles pop
shortly after President Buttigieg takes the reins, it will be imperative
for him to pass some kind of fiscal stimulus; with interest rates
already near historic lows, the Federal Reserve's capacity to mitigate a
downturn through monetary policy will be limited. In this scenario, do
you think Mitch McConnell will put country before party and approve a
bipartisan stimulus package to prevent the slump from deepening --- or
will he decide that deficits are bad again? History says this shouldn't
even be a question. The Senate lost and gone forever (or at least for a
decade). So we're looking at a historically ineffectual president who
has failed to deliver on any of his or her major campaign promises, and
is presiding over a needlessly severe recession.]{.underline} In this
scenario, how excited will the progressive base be to turn out for the
Democratic Party in 2022? [Once gridlock replaces Donald Trump in the
headlines, is it easier to imagine liberals sustaining their current
levels of civic engagement or catching up on lost brunches? Odds are,
complacency and disillusionment would depress liberal turnout, while
revanchist outrage would raise conservative participation, and economic
woes would turn swing voters against the party in power]{.underline}.
Even relatively effective presidents, presiding over good economic
times, tend to lose seats in midterm elections. In the scenario we've
sketched, a [red wave would likely drown the Democrats' House
majority,]{.underline} and allow Republicans to renew their lease on
(otherwise potentially flippable) Senate seats in Florida, Pennsylvania,
North Carolina, Iowa, and Ohio. And the GOP might even flip Democratic
seats in New Hampshire and Nevada while they're at it. [The 2022 Senate
map is the friendliest that Democrats are likely to see until those same
seats come up again in 2028. If Republicans win big in 2022, the Senate
could very well be theirs until the end of the decade. Barring a
revolution in the GOP's internal politics, that would mean no major
climate legislation at the federal level until it's much too late.
Meanwhile, when 2024 rolls around, Republicans will be one branch of
government shy of a trifecta, and the Democratic incumbent will have no
real achievements to run on.]{.underline} And next time, the GOP's
proto-authoritarian standard-bearer just might know how to stay on
message.

### Conflict

#### Trump's strategic ambiguity and unpredictability [deters]{.underline} global conflicts.

That Schelling's logic applies equally well to President Trump's
dealings with America's opponents has already been pointed out by other
commentators. They have referred to Nixon's madman theory of
negotiation, which holds that America's opponents will tread more
carefully if they perceive the president to be unpredictable or crazy.
It has been debated at some length whether Trump is using this theory in
a rational manner to extract concessions from U.S. adversaries, or if he
is "a madman in practice." Regardless, the point is that [President
Trump's **unpredictability** makes it next to **impossible to
calculate** the risk of escalation involved in challenging the United
States militarily,]{.underline} a concept also highlighted by Schelling.
[President Obama's reluctance to threaten]{.underline} and use
[force]{.underline} likely [**emboldened** China and Russia]{.underline}
to take greater military risks [in Eastern Ukraine, Syria, and in the
East and South China Seas.]{.underline} While [Beijing and
Moscow]{.underline} could be fairly confident that Obama would not take
military counter-measures, they [have no way of knowing
what]{.underline} President [Trump might do. It is]{.underline} very
[easy to imagine him giving the order to down a]{.underline} Chinese or
Russian [plane to demonstrate that "America is great
again."]{.underline} In this way, [Trump]{.underline} (intentionally or
not) [**reduces the risk of military confrontations** with China and
Russia. This gives both states greater incentive to **prioritize
diplomacy** over coercion]{.underline} in their efforts [to settle
disputes]{.underline} with the United States and its allies. Similarly,
[Trump's characterization of the nuclear agreement with Iran
as]{.underline} "[the worst]{.underline} deal [ever]{.underline}
negotiated" [gives Tehran strong incentive to honor]{.underline} it in
both letter and spirit [for fear of a potentially much worse
alternative]{.underline} if it collapses. Some are deeply worried that
Trump versus Kim Jong-un will prove a highly explosive combination,
which is understandable since North Korea has employing the same
negotiating tactics as Trump for decades with considerable success.
While the outcome of this confrontation is difficult to call, the
disastrous consequences of war are likely to lead to mutual restraint.
Moreover, [concern]{.underline} about what Trump might do [will induce
Beijing to redouble its efforts to **persuade Pyongyang** to be less
provocative.]{.underline} Good News for World Peace Paradoxically,
[Trump's]{.underline} tweets and the [theatrics]{.underline} are most
likely to [**enhance world peace.** They create unpredictability and
anxiety]{.underline} that the United States can use [to obtain greater
concessions]{.underline} from friends and foes. It is admittedly still
early days, but all indications are that [Trump will succeed in
coercing]{.underline} his [allies]{.underline} in both Asia and Europe
[to **increase**]{.underline} their **[defense spending]{.underline}**
significantly. Few of them will reach 2 percent of GDP in the next year
or two, but he has set in motion a process that will make most allies
spend far more much faster than they otherwise would have. [His
unpredictability is]{.underline} also [an asset in]{.underline}
America's [dealings with]{.underline} its opponents such as [China,
Iran, North Korea, and Russia. They will all]{.underline} need to [think
twice]{.underline} about provoking the United States and its allies
militarily because they have no way of calculating how President Trump
will react. Neither friends nor foes can be certain that Trump will not
do something that a rational cost-benefit calculating actor would not.
[U.S. allies used to regard American threats to withdraw]{.underline}
its forces [as bluff]{.underline} because the costs of doing so would be
prohibitive, [and the same logic has induced American opponents to
engage in military risk-taking]{.underline} with little fear of U.S.
military retaliation. [With Trump]{.underline} in the White House, [this
logic no longer applies.]{.underline} This is good news because [the
likely result is **strengthened U.S. alliances** and]{.underline} U.S.
[opponents that are more likely to favor negotiation over
provocation]{.underline} in their efforts to settle differences with the
United States and its allies.

### Econ

#### Trump reelection saves the economy and staves off recession

Stephanie **Landsman 4/16/19**

A Trump reelection should boost stocks and delay a recession, Nobel
Prize winner Robert Shiller says, CNBC,
<https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/16/trump-reelection-would-boost-stocks-delay-recession-robert-shiller.html>

[If]{.underline} President Donald **[Trump wins a second term, it could
prolong the bull market and delay a recession]{.underline}**, [Nobel
laureate]{.underline} Robert [Shiller says]{.underline}. [Shiller, who
is known for his behavioral finance research, believes the president's
pro-business policies would resonate with Wall Street for another four
years.]{.underline} "[It also seems likely that when]{.underline} Jerome
[Powell's term]{.underline} as Fed chairman [expires]{.underline},
**[he'll bring someone in that he controls more, and bring someone who
can stimulate the economy without worrying,"]{.underline}** the Yale
University economics professor said Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation. "
"It's also that [Trump is a model for extravagant living and big
spending. All these things are boosting of the stock
market."]{.underline} A weekend report by Goldman Sachs economists said
[Trump has a "narrow advantage]{.underline}" in the 2020 election. Not
only did it find incumbents generally have a built in bonus of 5 to 6
percentage points in the popular vote, the economy's relatively strong
performance ahead of the election bodes well for the president. [Since
Trump won the presidency]{.underline} in November 2016,
[the]{.underline} Dow and and Dow [have rallied]{.underline} 44% and
35%, respectively. Along the way, [there were corrections]{.underline}
in February 2018 and December 2018. [But]{.underline} Shiller points out
[the subsequent rebounds were encouraging]{.underline} --- at least to a
certain extent.

#### Trump's economy is the greatest since before the 70s. 

**Payton '19** (Dave Payton, Herald Dispatch 5-8-19 (Dave Peyton:
Unlikable as he is, Trump is good for the economy)

)/MP

I have a confession to make. As much as I hate to admit it, there is a
chance Trump is going to win next year, so I am hedging my bet. I am
dipping my toe again in the stock market. [The economy is booming. No
other word to describe it.]{.underline} Last Friday, [the Labor
Department announced that the economy added 263,000 jobs and hourly
wages grew by two-tenths of a percent in April.]{.underline} [The
unemployment rate - 3.6% - is at its lowest level since December 1969.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index of top stocks continues to be
near its record high despite the occasional blip and burp. The gross
domestic product rose by 3.2% in the first quarter, and while some
Democratic candidates are saying that income inequality means that most
Americans aren\'t feeling real benefits from the big numbers, I get the
impression that lots of Americans of all political views are quietly
admitting that these are good economic times and Trump is at least
partly responsible. In fact, polls indicate that most Americans approve
of Trump\'s economic machinations]{.underline} while most disapprove of
his non-economic programs. That\'s why last week [Trump said his
upcoming campaign will be based on the spectacular economy. It makes
sense.]{.underline} I don\'t know how much Trump has to do with the
booming stock market and the economy. The experts are divided over how
much a president has to do with the economy. But I suspect he has some
impact on the economy to some degree. For example, the [tax cuts he got
through Congress has made the super-rich happy and, in turn, they have
hired more people with their millions and raised wages for their
minions]{.underline}. And Trump\'s elimination of scores of federal
regulations on everything from coal to the environment may be destroying
America but it\'s making rich folks happy, happy, happy. I get the
distinct impression the Democrats are at a loss to know what to do to
win the presidential election next year. If the economy went south, it
would help the Democrats. But they don\'t want to say or do anything to
ruin the good feelings the best economy in decades is engendering among
hoi polloi. [The latest polls indicate that more than half like
\"Trump\'s economy\"]{.underline} but fewer than half approve of his
other programs, foreign or domestic. But back to bet-hedging. I\'m still
going to vote for the man or woman who winds up on the ballot opposite
Trump, even if it means a cooling of the economy. Trump not only angers
me like no other president in my lifetime, he embarrasses me. America is
rapidly becoming the laughingstock of the entire world. But as long as
the economy is booming, for whatever reason, I do not feel greedy for
making a little cash off it. If Trump wins next year, I\'ll grit my
teeth and make the most of a bad situation and continue to play the game
the rich folks play. And if he loses and a sane adult moves into the
White House, I may lose some cash, but I will gain an America I can be
proud of.

#### Look at the stats -- Trumps economy is booming and growing in every aspect. 

**Shanahan '18** (Bob Shanahan Senior Research Analyst (Why Donald Trump
Will Be The Greatest Jobs President of All TIme)

[Don't tell me this economy sucks. Sure, it's far from perfect, but look
at the statistics, look at Americans getting back to work, look at
manufacturing returning to our shores, and tell me that we are
doomed]{.underline}. Of course, the party won't last forever and the
downturn will eventually come. That said, [through the first
year-and-a-half of the Trump economy, we are seeing and are poised for
significant growth. The Trump administration's America First economic
policies are employing many Americans who have been out of work for some
time. Second quarter's GDP growth of 4.1 percent is the latest example
of Trump's deregulatory pro-jobs policies working wonders for the
country]{.underline}. And the third quarter could be even stronger.
Although we are still less than halfway through the third quarter, early
indicators point to an even higher GDP number, scheduled to be announced
on October 26. [The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow model, which sifts
through and analyzes current economic data to predict the current
quarter's **GDP growth, stood at 5 percent last week**, up slightly from
an initial estimate of 4.7 percent.]{.underline} The GDPNow model is not
perfect, but it does have a strong track record. Neil Dutta, head of
U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro, recently said the data is likely to
hold up and end close to 5 percent. [The average move for the reading
over the course of a quarter was a drop of 0.6 percentage
points]{.underline}. [The biggest downward move in GDPNow's history over
the course of a quarter was 2.2 percentage points, and the largest
upward move was 1.5 percentage points. If we see an uptick all the way
to 6.2 percent, **we will witness the highest quarterly GDP total since
2003**]{.underline}. **[President Trump's fiscal policy is giving a
boost to the economy.]{.underline}** Federal, state, and local fiscal
policies enacted by the [Trump administration boosted GDP growth by 0.6
percentage points in the second quarter]{.underline}, according to an
analysis by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal & Monetary Policy at the
Brookings Institution. This analysis, called the "fiscal impact
measure," tracks how much fiscal policies contribute to economic growth.
Over the last three quarters during Trump's time at the helm, we have
seen a significant upturn after falling below zero in 2011, when we saw
a four-year period of fiscal policies pushing growth into the negative
under President Obama. Federal spending was a significant contributor to
growth during the second quarter, rising 3.5 percent as Trump continues
to reveal himself as a big spender. The [economic reality is more than
encouraging during the first 18 months of the Trump
administration]{.underline}. Although there are still millions of
Americans out of the workforce, are bankrupt, underemployed, or riddled
with debt, there are many other positive trends worth noting. For
example, more than [2.8 million people have dropped food stamps since
Trump took office]{.underline}. [After food stamp enrollment hit an
all-time high in 2013 under Obama]{.underline}, food stamp enrollment
has fallen to an eight-year low. [President Trump continues to clamp
down on fraud and an improving economy is providing more jobs for
Americans who can get to work if they want to]{.underline}. The jobs are
out there. Trump has changed the dynamic and has prioritized getting
food stamp recipients off the government dole and back in the workforce.
Over the last 18 months, millions of Americans have discontinued their
food stamp benefits due to the Trump administration's impactful reforms
of the program at both the federal and state level. Although wage growth
continues to stay stubbornly below 3 percent annual increases,
employment is still expanding at a healthy pace[. The economy added
157,000 jobs in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the
unemployment rate ticked down to 3.9 percen]{.underline}t. Though the
unemployment rate is incomplete because it does not factor in the number
of people out of the workforce or underemployed, it still paints a
current economic snapshot. Economists are in agreement that there is a
strong job market nationwide and jobs available for those seeking
employment. The labor force participation rate stayed at just under 63
percent in July, unmoved from June. Job growth was seen in business
support, manufacturing, and healthcare. Recently released job growth
numbers were also revised upward for both May and June. Job creation has
averaged a 224,000 increase per month over the last three months,
roughly twice as high as is needed to keep unemployment on its downward
trend. Furthermore, layoffs and closures (outside of retail), have been
rare in recent weeks, signaling a continuation of employment growth in
the months to come. "Over the past couple of months what we're seeing is
a response to a very attractive labor market for job seekers," said
Cathy Barrera, ZipRecruiter's chief economist, in a recent interview.
"Like last month, it seems that we are seeing people come off of the
sidelines." Certain segments of society are enjoying unprecedented
levels of employment during the Trump economy. Hispanic unemployment
plunged to a new record low in July, falling to 4.5 percent from 4.6
percent in June. Jobless rates for high school dropouts also fell to a
record low in July. Although not all of this economic success can be
attributed to the Trump administration as the economy is in its ninth
year of expansion following the 2008-2009 recession and unemployment has
been steadily dropping since 2011, [the gains in employment have
accelerated over the last 18 months and Trump is accomplishing more in
that amount of time than Obama was able to do with eight full
years]{.underline}. President Obama, the first African American chief
executive, was unable to improve the lives of African Americans in this
country. [Black unemployment sits at 5.9 percent, the lowest since the
government started tracking this statistic in 1972]{.underline}. With
African Americans getting back to work and seeing their lives improve
under a Republican president, Donald Trump's approval ratings among
black voters has doubled over the last year, rising to 29 percent, up
from 15 percent at the same time a year before. The one economic
disruptor remains Trump's escalating trade war with China. With the
back-and-forth continuing through the summer months, companies are
getting nervous that earnings will be pared back dramatically in the
months to come with increasing tariffs. However, American businesses
have shown resounding resilience in recent months. Analysts expect
businesses to take the latest signs of a trade war in stride just as
they have done with previous threats from Trump and responses from China
and elsewhere. However, China has responded to Trump's latest tariffs by
taking aim at U.S. automakers and other manufacturers, resulting in a
jump of layoffs at a handful of companies. "The economy generally is so
strong that, despite the challenges of the potential trade war, the
strength of the economy is more than offsetting that," according to
Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles
Schwab & Co. Inc. "Corporations have posted record profits this quarter
that we haven't seen in over a decade." We will see if that continues
since increasing tariffs are bound to have a significant drag on profits
and earnings and possibly employment. The recent announcement of future
tariffs are making manufacturers and export-reliant companies especially
nervous. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative just finalized a
set of 25 percent tariffs to be imposed on China. U.S. Customs and
Border Protection will begin collecting the duties covering \$16 billion
worth of goods from China on August 23rd after the first round of
tariffs directed at China impacted \$34 billion worth of goods. The
Trump administration states that it is imposing these tariffs to
pressure China into changing its unfair trading practices against
American companies. Something many politicians have promised to do and
our president is actually doing. Trump has been railing against China
and its trading tactics as far back as the 1980s. He wants fair
international trade and he is doing everything he can to make that a
reality. But there are going to be some growing pains as the president
ratchets up the trade war and takes on China directly. A hearing will be
held from August 20-23 to consider a third round of tariffs covering
\$200 billion of Chinese products, which means the trade war is only
going to get more disruptive through the rest of 2018. Despite
uncertainty on trade, **[the Trump economy is firing on all
cylinders.]{.underline}** [People are getting back to work. American
consumers have more money in their pockets to spend. Jobs are available
for people who want to work. We need to focus more on retraining our
population to be able to fill the jobs that are available but cannot be
filled by qualified workers. Looking forward to the third and fourth
quarters, we could see a huge economic year if things continue on this
positive trajector]{.underline}y. 4 percent annual GDP growth could
become a reality. 3 percent wage growth could be attainable. Record-low
unemployment should continue to go lower and lower. President Trump will
likely be the greatest jobs president of all time. But that all depends
on Americans getting off the sidelines and getting back to work. It's
starting to happen but there are still many out there that refuse to
work for a living. We need to encourage those people to support
themselves. We need to implement a merit-based immigration system that
brings people into this country that will contribute to our society and
fill open jobs. But most of all, we need to support President Trump in
his pursuit of putting America, its economy, and its people first and
foremost.

Donald [Trump's victory in]{.underline} the [2016]{.underline} U.S.
presidential election [heralded]{.underline} nothing less than [certain
catastrophe.]{.underline} At least, [that]{.underline} was and [remains
the firm belief of "the Blob"]{.underline}---what Ben Rhodes, a foreign
policy adviser in the Obama administration, called [those]{.underline}
from both parties [in]{.underline} the mainstream [media
and]{.underline} the [foreign policy]{.underline} establishment who,
[driven by habitual ideas and]{.underline} no small amount of piety and
[false wisdom,]{.underline} worry about the decline of the U.S.-led
order. "We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end
in sight," the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman forecast after
Trump's victory. Others prophesied that Trump would resign by the end of
his first year (Tony Schwartz, the co-author of Trump: The Art of the
Deal), that he would be holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in six months
(the liberal commentator John Aravosis), or that the United States might
be headed down the same path that Germany took from the Weimar Republic
to the Third Reich. That last warning came from former U.S. President
Barack Obama last December at the Economic Club of Chicago, where he
invoked the specter of Nazi Germany. "We have to tend to this garden of
democracy or else things could fall apart quickly," he said. "Sixty
million people died, so you've got to pay attention---and vote." [So
far, the world has not come to an end, far from it. A year into Trump's
first term,]{.underline} the Islamic State, or
**[ISIS]{.underline}**---a fascist organization, by the way---**[had
been virtually defeated in Syria and]{.underline}** eliminated from all
its havens in [**Iraq,** thanks to]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration['s decision to equip the]{.underline} largely [Kurdish
militia]{.underline} fighting ISIS [in Syria and give U.S. ground
commanders **greater latitude** to direct operations.]{.underline} All
the while, [Trump has continued the Obama doctrine of avoiding
large-scale conventional wars]{.underline} in the Middle East [and has
succeeded]{.underline} where his predecessor failed [in enforcing a
**real red line against**]{.underline} Bashar al-**[Assad's use of nerve
gas]{.underline}** in Syria [by launching targeted air
strikes]{.underline} in response. [In North Korea, Trump's]{.underline}
strategy of ["maximum pressure"]{.underline} has [cut the country's
international payments by half, **forcing Kim Jong Un**]{.underline} to
realize that his only choice is **[to negotiate.]{.underline}** On the
domestic front, the unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent in May, a
level not seen since the heady days of the dot-com boom---with
unemployment at an all-time low among African Americans; at or near
multidecade lows among Hispanics, teenagers, and those with less than a
high school education; and at a 65-year low among women in the labor
force. Meanwhile, on Trump's watch, the stock market and consumer
confidence have hit all-time highs, the number of mortgage applications
for new homes has reached a seven-year high, and gas prices have fallen
to a 12-year low. Finally, with Trump pledging to bring to an end the
era in which "our politicians seem more interested in defending the
borders of foreign countries than their own," illegal immigration was
reduced by 38 percent from November 2016 to November 2017, and in April
2017, the U.S. Border Patrol recorded 15,766 apprehensions at the
southwestern border---the lowest in at least 17 years. As his critics
charge, [Trump does reject many]{.underline} of the core [tenets of the
liberal]{.underline} international [order,]{.underline} the sprawling
and multifaceted system that the United States and its allies built and
have supported for seven decades. Questioning the very fabric of
international cooperation, he has assaulted the world trading system,
reduced funding for the UN, denounced NATO, threatened to end
multilateral trade agreements, called for Russia's readmission to the
G-7, and scoffed at attempts to address global challenges such as
climate change. But [despite what the crowd of globalists at Davos might
say, these policies should be welcomed,]{.underline} not feared.
[Trump's **transactional approach** to foreign relations marks a United
States]{.underline} less [interested]{.underline} in managing its
long-term relationships than [in making gains]{.underline} on short-term
deals. Trump has sent the message that [the United States will now look
after its own interests,]{.underline} narrowly defined, not the
interests of the so-called global community, even at the expense of
long-standing allies. [This worldview is fundamentally
realist]{.underline} in nature. On the campaign trail and in office,
[Trump has argued that the United States needs its allies to share
responsibility for]{.underline} their own [defense. He has]{.underline}
also [called for better trade deals]{.underline} to level a playing
field tilted against American businesses and workers and to protect
domestic manufacturing industries from currency manipulation. [He is an
economic nationalist]{.underline} at heart. He believes that political
factors should determine economic relations, that globalization does not
foster harmony among states, and that economic interdependence increases
national vulnerability. He has also argued that the state should
intervene when the interests of domestic actors diverge from its
own---for example, when he called for a boycott against Apple until the
company helped the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the terrorists
who carried out the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California. [This
realist worldview is not only legitimate but also resonates with
American voters, who rightly recognize that the United States is no
longer inhabiting the unipolar world it did since the end of the Cold
War; instead, it is]{.underline} living in a more
**[multipolar]{.underline}** one, [**with greater competition.** Trump
is merely]{.underline} shedding shibboleths and [seeing international
politics for what it]{.underline} is and [has always been: a highly
competitive realm populated by self-interested states]{.underline}
concerned with their own security and economic welfare. Trump's "America
first" agenda is radical only in the sense that it seeks to promote the
interests of the United States above all. NO MORE UNCLE SUGAR A key part
of [Trump's agenda is to rebalance]{.underline} the United States'
[trade accounts]{.underline} with the rest of the world. The goal is [to
correct]{.underline} systematic and excessive [trade
imbalances]{.underline} with wealthy East Asia and Europe, [while
protecting industries vital to U.S. national security.]{.underline} The
balance of trade is the difference between the value of a country's
exports and the value of its imports. When a country imports more than
it exports, it is running a trade deficit, which means that it must rely
on foreign direct investment or borrow money to make up the difference.
In the long run, persistent trade deficits lower the total demand for
goods and services in a country, reducing growth and employment. In
2017, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services grew by 12 percent,
to \$566 billion, the biggest gap since 2008. Given this imbalance in
trade, it is odd that Trump is the one being branded by the United
States' supposed friends and allies as a protectionist, hell-bent on
destroying the liberal economic order. To these ingrates, the Trump
administration has sent a straightforward message: you will no longer be
allowed to play the United States for a sucker. In other words, no more
Uncle Sugar. The Blob worries that the policies enacted by the Trump
administration signal a major reduction in the United States'
willingness to promote global trade and investment, but
[Trump's]{.underline} threats of [tariffs and]{.underline} other
[protectionist measures are]{.underline} better seen as [bargaining
chips]{.underline} designed [to open]{.underline} other countries'
[markets.]{.underline} They also represent attempts to elevate trade
diplomacy to greater strategic prominence, using sanctions and other
forms of economic statecraft to pressure states to do things that
Washington wants but that they otherwise wouldn't do. [After all, the
United States remains the world's leading market for exports, which
gives]{.underline} the country [massive bargaining leverage]{.underline}
in trade negotiations. But it has traditionally failed to exploit that
leverage, since any attempt to do so draws jeers from defenders of the
liberal international order. Trump has chosen a different path. [With
China,]{.underline} the United States' only potential peer competitor,
**[Trump has used trade diplomacy to press Beijing to make a number of
valuable concessions.]{.underline}** The U.S. trade deficit with China
now stands at \$375 billion; during talks in May, news outlets reported
that [Chinese officials]{.underline} had [committed to reducing it by
\$200 billion by 2020.]{.underline} The Trump administration continues
to press the Chinese government to end what Washington considers unfair
subsidies and other aid to Chinese firms. For years, Chinese state
enterprises have been buying up their U.S. competitors in high-tech
sectors, while U.S. firms are prohibited from making equivalent
purchases in China, but now, the White House is wisely looking to
subject China to similar investment hurdles. As The New York Times in
March, it "is preparing to limit Chinese investment in sensitive
American technology, ranging from microchips to 5G wireless technology."
In a step toward correcting the imbalance in U.S.-Chinese economic
relations, the [Trump]{.underline} administration has [imposed
antidumping duties]{.underline} on large Chinese washing machines and
solar energy equipment, [and]{.underline} it has [levied tariffs on
steel and aluminum]{.underline} for reasons of national security. In
April, the administration threatened to slap stiff tariffs on some \$50
billion in Chinese imports across 1,300 categories of products,
unveiling the most aggressive challenge in decades to Beijing's trade
practices. China responded by offering to purchase some \$70 billion in
U.S. exports if the Trump administration called off the threatened
tariffs. And [in May, China reduced its tariff on foreign automobiles
from 25 percent to 15 percent.]{.underline} ([The United States' stands
at 2.5 percent.]{.underline}) Trump has made clear that even the United
States' neighbors and closest allies are not exempt from U.S. tariffs.
In late May, he made good on a key campaign promise when he moved
forward with a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a ten percent
tariff on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico, and the EU. As
justification, the administration cited national security, invoking the
Commerce Department's conclusion that imported metal degrades the
American industrial base. Canada announced retaliatory steps, and it and
every other member of the G-7 besides the United States issued a joint
statement conveying their "unanimous concern and disappointment" with
the U.S. decision. Global outrage aside, Trump's justification for the
tariffs is little more than Realism 101. As the political scientist
Jonathan Kirshner has observed, in an anarchic world, "states will
strive for national self-sufficiency, in order to assure the ability to
produce the means to fight, as well as to reduce vulnerabilities that
would result from the disruption of peacetime patterns of international
economic flows." Indeed, in his signal foreign policy speech during the
campaign, Trump himself articulated just such a view: "No country has
ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our
friends and our enemies put their countries above ours, and we, while
being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer
surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The
nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony."
Trump's words have a distinctly realist ring to them. NO MORE
MULTILATERALISM [Another plank of Trump's foreign policy platform is
that the United States should work with]{.underline} its international
[partners on a bilateral basis]{.underline} whenever possible, [rather
than through multilateral arrangements]{.underline} and commitments.
Along these lines, [the administration has withdrawn from the
Iran]{.underline} nuclear [deal, the
T]{.underline}rans-[P]{.underline}acific [P]{.underline}artnership,
[and]{.underline} the [Paris]{.underline} agreement on climate change.
At the UN, it has proposed reducing U.S. contributions to the
organization by 40 percent, forced the General Assembly to cut \$600
million from the peacekeeping budget, announced its intention to
withdraw from UNESCO and the UN Human Rights Council, and abandoned
talks on migration. Trump has also threatened to end the North American
Free Trade Agreement and instead strike separate bilateral agreements
with Canada and Mexico, which he contends are easier to enforce than
multilateral arrangements. **[Multilateralism]{.underline}**, in Trump's
view, [**"reduces our ability to control our own affairs."** Even
defenders of the liberal international order should concede that he is
right,]{.underline} since this is precisely what a rules-based order is
designed to achieve: to place limits on the returns to, and the
capricious exercise of, outsize power in the conduct of international
relations. In fact, those who champion such an order seek nothing less
than a revolutionary transformation of world politics, hoping to replace
the anarchic international system driven by brute force with one
governed by the rule of law. For these proponents, the trick has always
been to convince weak and secondary states---that is, everyone but the
United States---that institutional restraints and multilateral
commitments will limit the hegemon's freedom of action. For such an
order to work, it must be autonomous, able to enforce its rules
independent of the hegemon's wishes. Otherwise, there is no reason for
other countries to believe that the order will ever limit the hegemon's
power. Well, the jig is up. [Trump has given the lie to the notion
that]{.underline} many of the [institutions]{.underline} of the postwar
order [actually bind the United States,]{.underline} and he has walked
away from them accordingly. The weakness of the order should come as no
surprise: ever since the end of World War II, international institutions
and norms have rested on U.S. power and so cannot be used to hold back
the United States. To the extent that the United States has been
restrained, it has been the result of self-restraint---a characteristic
that few have accused Trump of exhibiting. The United States'
[leaders]{.underline} and foreign policy elites [have been championing
multilateralism]{.underline}, international institutions, and the rule
of law as values in themselves, [regardless of how they affected U.S.
national interests.]{.underline} NO MORE FREE-RIDING [The final piece of
Trump's foreign policy is his insistence that U.S. allies pay their fair
share of]{.underline} the costs of their [defense. NATO]{.underline}
itself [concedes that the United States accounts for 73 percent
of]{.underline} the alliance's [defense spending]{.underline}---a rather
large amount for an organization with 29 member states and that is
focused on European security. Nonetheless, commentators in this magazine
and elsewhere have routinely derided Trump for mocking U.S. allies as
free riders. So, they might have added, did Obama. "Free riders
aggravate me," he complained in a 2016 interview with The Atlantic. His
list of partners not pulling their weight included the United Kingdom,
and he warned that the country would no longer be able to claim a
"special relationship" with the United States unless it spent at least
two percent of its GDP on defense. [For decades, U.S. presidents have
complained about]{.underline} allies' [free-riding, but]{.underline}
when push came to shove, they [failed to do much]{.underline} about the
problem. [During the Cold War,]{.underline} the United States and its
allies confronted [a shared Soviet threat]{.underline},
[mak]{.underline}ing [it]{.underline} at least
[understandable]{.underline} that Washington would allow the problem to
persist. Now that the dragon has been slain---many, many years ago---and
at a time when the U.S. government is considering huge cuts in social
spending to restore fiscal health, **[there is no justification
whatsoever for the United States to continue subsidizing European
countries' security.]{.underline}** As the political scientist Barry
Posen has put it in this magazine, "This is welfare for the rich."
[Trump's attacks on NATO seem to be getting results. Defense spending
among the alliance's European members has hit its highest point since
2010.]{.underline} According to the Blob, however, Trump is not merely
trying to get allies to pay their fair share; he is actively plotting to
destroy NATO. In a column in June, David Leonhardt of The New York Times
wrote, "If a president of the United States were to sketch out a secret,
detailed plan to break up the Atlantic alliance, that plan would bear a
striking resemblance to Trump's behavior." What Leonhardt appears to
have forgotten is that the greatest enemy of an alliance is victory.
When the West won the Cold War, NATO lost its raison d'être. In an
increasingly multipolar world, alliances are less fixed: today's friend
may be tomorrow's enemy (or, at a minimum, competitor), and vice versa.
Trump accepts this. He is operating according to the realpolitik
principle that former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once
summarized: "America has no permanent friends or enemies, only
interests." [Trump's realist instincts are on display]{.underline} most
clearly [in]{.underline} his approach [to Russia. Just as every
president before him, Trump has met with the leader of the Kremlin in
search of cooperation]{.underline} on a range of security issues (in
this case, particularly on Iran and Syria) and, at a most basic and
existential level, to avoid war between the two nuclear superpowers.
[Those yelling]{.underline} the loudest that Russia is a mortal enemy of
the United States and [that Trump is]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin's puppet are the]{.underline} very [same people who
**woefully mismanaged U.S. foreign policy**]{.underline} over the past
quarter century. The bottom line is that **[Trump is not the primary
reason NATO's]{.underline}** ties are **[fraying; the international
structure is.]{.underline}** Indeed, this was also true for his
predecessor. Much of what annoyed the foreign policy elite about Obama's
minimalist strategic goals---his talk of hitting "singles and doubles,"
for example---was structural in nature. During the Cold War, in the
words of the political scientist G. John Ikenberry, "America needed
allies and allies needed America," a codependence that "created
incentives for cooperation in areas outside of national security." That
changed [with the end of the shared Soviet threat. The United States
became less constrained in its foreign policy, but so did its
allies.]{.underline} They have had less need for a superpower patron,
and so Washington has less leverage over them than it once did. In 1993,
the realist international relations theorist Kenneth Waltz wisely
observed, "The Soviet Union created NATO, and the demise of the Soviet
threat 'freed' Europe, West as well as East. But freedom entails
self-reliance." Writing of European countries, Waltz concluded, "In the
not-very-long run, they will have to learn to take care of themselves or
suffer the consequences." A quarter century later, the "not-very-long
run" has finally arrived. [Trump did not create that reality; he has
merely recognized it.]{.underline} IT'S THE STRUCTURE, STUPID To be
fair, not all has gone well under the Trump administration. After
denouncing nation building and calling the war in Afghanistan a
"complete waste," the president was persuaded by his top advisers to
forgo a hasty withdrawal from the country, which they claimed would
create a vacuum for ISIS and al Qaeda to fill, and to support instead a
small infusion of U.S. troops to beat back a resurgent Taliban. "My
original instinct was to pull out, and historically, I like following my
instincts," Trump said as he announced the new strategy. "But all my
life, I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind
the desk in the Oval Office." He should have followed his gut instead of
embracing the ludicrous notion that a few thousand U.S. troops would be
able to accomplish what 100,000 previously could not: break the
stalemate in the longest war in American history. But what Trump
recognizes is that the liberal international order is sick. This
illness, as the columnist Martin Wolf has argued, is a function of, at
the global level, "the declining relevance of the west as a security
community after the end of the cold war, together with its diminishing
economic weight, especially in relation to China." At the domestic
level, the problems stem from the feeling among many in rich countries
that they have not benefited from the liberal world order. "It is
generating, instead, the sense of lost opportunities, incomes and
respect." Many Americans rightly feel that globalization, by bringing
cheap consumer goods into the country and outsourcing jobs to lower-paid
workers overseas, has ruined U.S. manufacturing, increasing unemployment
and depressing wages. No wonder Trump's complaints about unfair trade
deals resonated with so many voters, especially those in the industrial
Midwest. Blinded by their distaste for the man, [foreign policy elites
have lost sight of the larger international structural forces that
propelled Trump to power.]{.underline} To see these driving forces at
work, one must return to the end of the Cold War. As the lone
superpower, the United States remained deeply engaged with the world,
but the purpose of this engagement had changed. During the Cold War, the
goal was to contain the Soviet Union; the United States was acting out
of defense and wished to maintain the status quo. But afterward, the
United States embraced revisionism in the guise of liberalism. As the
unchallenged hegemon, it endeavored to remold large swaths of the world
to fit its image of international order. Washington not only aligned
itself with democracy, human rights, and justice but also actively
promoted these liberal values abroad. Doing so marked the end of Cold
War pragmatism and the advent of a crusading style of U.S. foreign
policy. In the dreams of U.S. foreign policy elites, all countries,
including authoritarian great powers such as China and Russia, would now
become supplicants in a U.S.-dominated world order. Then came [the Great
Recession]{.underline}, which, coupled with the rise of China and a
resurgent Russia, ca[st doubt on the United States' relative
power.]{.underline} The result is that [the unipolar era]{.underline},
if not already over, [is beginning to wind down.]{.underline} Declining
powers under conditions of low vulnerability tend to reduce their
peripheral commitments and look inward (as the United Kingdom did after
World War I, for example). It should come as no surprise, then, that so
many Americans have finally begun to question their country's
long-standing grand strategy of playing the world's policeman and voted
for the candidate who vowed to put America first. With the American era
nearing an end, **[Washington must pursue a new grand strategy to deal
with the new situation. Trump's brand of realism offers just such a
strategy.]{.underline}**

[The real question in analyzing the May jobs numbers released Friday is
whether there are enough synonyms for "good" in an online thesaurus to
describe them adequately.]{.underline} So, for example, "splendid" and
"excellent" fit the bill. Those are the kinds of terms that are
appropriate [when the United States economy adds 223,000 jobs in a
month, despite being nine years into an expansion, and when the
unemployment rate falls to 3.8 percent, a new 18-year low.]{.underline}
"Salubrious," "salutary" and "healthy" work as words to describe the
[0.3 percent rise in average hourly earnings, which are up 2.7 percent
over the last year --- a nice improvement but also not the kind of sharp
increase that might lead the Federal Reserve to rethink its cautious
path of interest rate increases. And a broader definition of
unemployment, which includes people who have given up looking for a job
out of frustration, fell to 7.6 percent. The jobless rate for
African-Americans fell to 5.9 percent, the lowest on
record]{.underline}, which we would count as "great." If anything, some
of the thesaurus offerings don't really do these numbers justice. But
[some aspects of the report would be fairly described as "solid,"
"decent" or "benign," such as the uptick in the ratio of the adult
population that is employed to 60.4 percent, which only matches its
recent high of earlier in the year.]{.underline} X

The June report indicates that [robust jobs growth is coupled with

"Why America\'s Grand Strategy Has Not Changed: Power, Habit, and the
U.S. Foreign Policy Establishment," International Security, Volume 42,
Number 04, Harvard/MIT) BW

Another significant test case for my argument is the first year of the
Trump administration. Inaugurated on January 20, 2017, [Trump posed a
greater challenge to the established security order than any incoming
president since Nixon.]{.underline} As an outsider, [he was elected on a
wave of revolt against the costs and burdens of
primacy]{.underline}---and against the Blob. [Trump
rejected]{.underline} the [bipartisan]{.underline} cause of U.S.
[leadership.]{.underline} His slogan, ["America First," evoked interwar
isolationism and zero-sum nationalism.]{.underline} The critical test is
how Trump behaved in office and whether an iconoclastic president
ultimately conformed with tradition. Preliminary observation suggests
that his behavior accords with my argument's forecasts. Trump is not a
typical president. [But on grand strategic questions, **tradition
imposed constraints.**]{.underline}

A property tycoon and media celebrity, Trump ran for office as an
insurgent against the establishment. He was the first president without
elective office experience since Dwight Eisenhower. He based his
campaign on hostility toward the status quo and the policy elite that
guarded it. He characterized government officials and lobbyists as a
corrupt oligarchy, vowing to "drain the swamp" and "look for new
people."144 [Trump threatened to shred traditional alliances,
accommodate major adversaries, tolerate nuclear proliferation, abandon
the frequent use of military force, and exchange free trade for
protectionism.]{.underline} Former senior security officials, defense
intellectuals, and ex-presidents attacked his probity, sanity, and
legitimacy. Both sides presented the November 2016 election as a contest
over the fundamentals of the United States' role in the world.145

As Trump took aim at traditional U.S. grand strategy, [some]{.underline}
foreign policy [experts predicted that he would]{.underline} run an
experiment in applying retrenchment-based strategies long advocated by
academic realists, [bring primacy to an end,]{.underline}146 [and
convert the Pax Americana into a "transactional protection
racket."]{.underline}147 Traditionalists feared that Trump stirred a
popular tide against the burdens of U.S. primacy, thus destroying the
domestic basis for it. Voters may not have elected Trump primarily
because of his stances on alliances or nuclear proliferation. They did,
however, respond to his assaults on free trade, failed wars, free-riding
allies, and the negative consequences of globalization for American
workers. Registered Trump voters ranked foreign policy high on their
list of priorities.148 Trump's broader attack on existing grand strategy
and the foreign policy establishment resonated.

[Yet in Trump's first year, there was **more continuity than change**
regarding grand strategic issues.]{.underline} Within months, [Trump
"abandoned stances that were at the bedrock of his establishment-bashing
campaign."]{.underline}149 [His first choices were surprisingly
"mainstream,"]{.underline} to the approval of traditionalists and
displeasure of revisionists.150 The power of the Blob and [tradition
constrained Trump's administration, making his stance toward U.S. global
commitments more orthodox than was expected,]{.underline} in substance
if not in style.

TRUMP'S CONTINUITY

Before becoming president, [Trump threatened to tear up long-standing
alliances. He branded NATO]{.underline} outmoded, expensive, irrelevant
to contemporary security problems, and ["obsolete."]{.underline}151 At
other times, he threatened to change the basis of alliances, making what
had been permanent U.S. commitments more conditional and transactional,
[issuing threats to allies in Europe and Asia]{.underline} that the
United States might abandon them if they did not pay up.152 [Trump
implied similar policies for the Persian Gulf.]{.underline} As a
candidate, Trump argued that Saudi Arabia, as the traditional bulwark of
U.S. power projection in the Gulf, should pay more for the United
States' "tremendous service," accusing it of complicity in the September
11 attacks.153 Trump suggested that he would accommodate the United
States' rivals, especially Russia. [He promised to give
Russia]{.underline}, NATO's resurgent adversary, [a freer geopolitical
hand. He would shift burdens by forcing allies to pay for protection.
Such open threats struck against the grand strategy of primacy, which
regards permanent commitments as essential even if the distribution of
sacrifices is lopsided.]{.underline}

[Within only months of his presidency, **Trump altered both the rhetoric
and substance of his stance toward allies.** By April 2017, NATO was "no
longer obsolete."]{.underline}154 In May, [Trump increased by 40 percent
the United States' European Reassurance Initiative,]{.underline}
established by Obama to signal the U.S. commitment to Europe with
increased troops, infrastructure, and exercises after Russia's
annexation of Crimea in 2014.155 In addresses in Brussels in May 2017
and Warsaw in July, [Trump signaled support for NATO]{.underline} while
insisting its members contribute more.156 By June, [he had reaffirmed
the U.S. commitment to Article 5]{.underline} of the NATO Charter.157 At
the urging of advisers, Trump now took only a more abrasive version of
the position taken by every president since Eisenhower---that NATO is
vital, but that member states should contribute more. In the Middle
East, [Trump embraced Saudi Arabia and the Gulf monarchies in the United
States' traditional role as armorer and protector; in]{.underline} his
May visit to [Riyadh, he signed a \$110 billion arms deal]{.underline}
and jettisoned "America First" rhetoric in favor of "bipartisan
internationalism."158 Within six months of taking office, [Trump's
strategic vision for the world's key power centers]{.underline}--- the
Gulf, Europe, and East Asia---[held the United States to be the
**principal security provider.**]{.underline} In Asia, Secretary for
Defense James [Mattis reassured Japan and South Korea of U.S. alliance
commitments.]{.underline}159 Toward Russia, [Trump did not lift
sanctions imposed to penalize Moscow's adventurism in the Ukraine. He
authorized the sale of "defensive" weapons to Ukraine against
Russia-leaning separatists, sold Patriot missiles to Poland, and
demanded that Russia withdraw from Crimea.]{.underline} In its 2017
National Security Strategy, the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
**[promised continued primacy, dominance in key regions, and
counterproliferation, while more explicitly acknowledging competition
with rivals.]{.underline}**160

[Trump also has rededicated the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[to military]{.underline} preponderance and the frequent use of [force
that is a hallmark of U.S. unipolarity. Campaigning for office,
Trump]{.underline} denounced his opponent's hawkishness. He [promised to
reduce]{.underline} and focus [the use of force,]{.underline} to "stop
racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we
shouldn't be involved with," to withdraw from Afghanistan,161 to avoid
nation-building expeditions, and to focus on the Islamic State and
counterterrorism.162

[Upon taking office, Trump showed a propensity toward using
force.]{.underline} By July 31, 2017, [he had overseen]{.underline} the
unleashing of 80 percent of the total number of bombs dropped by the
United States under Obama during the whole of 2016, including [the most
bombs dropped on Afghanistan since 2012.]{.underline}163
[He]{.underline} also [increased the U.S. ground commitment]{.underline}
to Afghanistan.164 In the name of deterring the use of chemical weapons,
[Trump bombed]{.underline} President Bashar al-[Assad's regime in Syria.
He also bolstered U.S. military deployments to NATO's eastern flank.
Trump declared an increased defense budget and an ambition for **nuclear
supremacy.**]{.underline} His combination of arms buildup and budget
expansion amounted to "warmed-over Reaganism"; and like Reagan, Trump's
administration formulated its budget on the advice of the primacist
Heritage Foundation.165 [Trump]{.underline} also conformed with the
tradition of "inhibition," [forcefully confronting North Korea over its
nuclear and missile programs.]{.underline} While campaigning, he
suggested he would tolerate nuclear proliferation by South Korea, Japan,
and Saudi Arabia. He imagined negotiating with the "rogue" proliferator,
North Korea's ruler Kim Jong-un, suggesting that nuclear proliferation
was both inevitable and acceptable.166 These sentiments violated decades
of tradition, whereby the United States has inhibited proliferation
through security guarantees, troop deployments, arms sales, nuclear
umbrellas, and sanctions threats. [By]{.underline} the summer of [2017,
Trump had converted to denuclearization and was engaged in brinkmanship
with North Korea, attempting to coerce Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear
ambitions.]{.underline} In July 2017, [he]{.underline} approved plans to
[increase U.S. freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea,
to resist Chinese expansion]{.underline}.167 **[Trump's America
exercises military preponderance, maintains alliances, and pursues
counterproliferation---even at the risk of war---to forestall the
emergence of challengers and prevent a return to multipolar
disorder.]{.underline}**

EXPLAINING CONTINUITY: TRUMP AND THE BLOB

Trump's conformity on major grand-strategic questions fits my argument's
predictions. He took office at a time when the electorate was buffeted
by war weariness and the long-term stresses of the 2008 global financial
crisis. These pressures could have been a basis for grand strategic
revision. Yet [**Trump is not trying to overhaul grand strategy.** He
has been unwilling to spend the political capital that such a revision
would require.]{.underline} In the absence of a determined agent of
change, the Blob's advantages persist. [The Blob has a privileged
position in presidential staffing and security expertise; it exerts
dominance over the security discourse; and it is reinforced by the
demands of allies.]{.underline}

With Trump elected, the Blob urged capable bureaucrats to boycott the
administration. At the same time, they lobbied the president to uphold
tradition.168 Trump suffered a staffing dilemma. To appoint experienced
officials to key positions would install defenders of the status quo.
Yet to appoint untutored outsiders would raise risks of error, and to
mix both groups would threaten coherence.169 In forming his transition
team, [Trump leaned heavily on Washington insiders he had once
denounced,]{.underline} including former administration officials and
corporate lobbyists. Trump reached into the "big pool" of his party for
the "most highly qualified" candidates.170 His senior appointees were
mostly primacists who had the Blob's blessing. These included Secretary
of Defense James Mattis, a retired Marine general and former Hoover
Institution fellow, who with Vice President Mike Pence assured NATO of
the United States' continued support.171 Trump appointed as director of
central intelligence Mike Pompeo, known for his hawkish stances against
nuclear proliferation and Russian adventurism, as well as support for
arms sales to Israel and Taiwan.172 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a
former oil executive endorsed by Robert Gates, vowed to assert U.S.
primacy against China's expansion and to oppose nuclear
proliferation.173 Trump appointed as national security adviser Gen. H.R.
McMaster, a protégé of the orthodox Gen. David Petraeus. McMaster has
argued that the provision of U.S. security is indispensable, and that
retrenchment will create dangerous vacuums.174 Trump appointed former
senator, lobbyist, and diplomat Dan Coats as director of national
intelligence. He appointed critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin
to every major national security post, significant given that Russia is
the focal point of criticisms that his diplomacy is compromised.175
These included former presidential candidate, governor and ambassador
Jon Huntsman as ambassador to Russia; Wess Mitchell, who coauthored a
study cautioning against the weakening or abandonment of alliances, as
assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs; and
Fiona Hill, a Brookings Kremlin analyst skeptical of the possibility of
a Russia-U.S. accommodation, as White House senior director for Europe
and Russia.176

Partly because of the Blob's mobilization against the new president, the
administration remained significantly understaffed. The failure to
appoint many subcabinet posts meant that many senior advisers are career
civil servants of what Trump denounced as the "permanent government."
Valuable expertise also explains the retention of holdovers from the
Obama administration, such as diplomat Brett McGurk with his "almost
impossible-to-replicate, case-specific knowledge."177 Trump appointed
some government outsiders with unorthodox views, such as his son-in-law
Jared Kushner and the anti-globalist Steve Bannon. But in the White
House, a power center emerged of traditionalist military figures with a
commitment to primacy, who exerted restraining inºuence.178
Significantly, after initially appointing Bannon to the NSC Principals
Committee and removing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
director of national intelligence, Trump stripped Bannon of his NSC role
and restored the chairman and director.179

With the anti-globalists sidelined, an intensive and coordinated
briefing on July 20, 2017, by the traditionalists Pence, Mattis, and
Tillerson influenced Trump, "explaining the critical importance of
forward worldwide deployments" and dangers of retrenchment, tailoring
the "Open Door" logic to Trump's background, and emphasizing the value
of "military, intelligence officers and diplomats" in "making the world
safe for American businesses."180 In his inner convictions, Trump does
not have to convert to primacy for primacy to persist. On major
questions, he felt its constraints, even when watching television, as he
frequently did. As the scholar Daniel Drezner suggested, ["The more
mainstream foreign policy advisers are better at being on
television."]{.underline}181

[The Blob]{.underline} enjoys a number of advantages. As well as
influence within the security bureaucracy, it [can attack the legitimacy
of measures that offend tradition.]{.underline} It can [act through the
courts and]{.underline} the quiet resistance of [civil servants, and
articulate alternatives through well-funded think tanks. It has strong
institutional platforms in Congress, links to a powerful business
community, and a network of nongovernmental organizations.
**Trump**]{.underline}, with his inchoate worldview, [**was not a
determined revisionist who could overcome these obstacles,** and,
instead, on security issues, if not on tariffs and protectionism,
quickly fell into line.]{.underline}

overhaul, if not [end, a decades-old American
alliance]{.underline}---but it didn't come at the direction of the
alliance-skeptical Donald Trump. [The president]{.underline}, in fact,
[has]{.underline} paradoxically **[emerged as the greatest force of
resistance to the change]{.underline}**. [Fed up with the catastrophic
human cost of Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen's civil
war]{.underline} and appalled by the murder of the Washington Post
columnist Jamal Khashoggi, [Congress seemingly attempts some sort of
measure to censure the kingdom every week]{.underline}. Yet at every
turn, the White House has blocked or circumvented those moves, standing
staunchly by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MbS, while
escalating its confrontation with his archenemy, Iran. **[The real
reckoning in the U.S.-Saudi partnership could come if a Democrat is
elected president in 2020]{.underline}**, though early warning signs are
already visible. [Virtually all Democratic lawmakers]{.underline}, along
with several Republican members of Congress and various lobbyists,
analysts, and former officials, [are shunning the Saudis to the point
where a visit to Washington, D.C., by MbS, the heir apparent who was
welcomed in 2017 and 2018, seems inconceivable anytime
soon.]{.underline} When Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz met
aboard the USS Quincy in 1945, neither could have foreseen the cracks
that would form in a relationship built on mutual benefit: a steady
supply of Saudi oil in exchange for U.S. military protection. But [even
the fallout from the September 11 attacks]{.underline}---in which 15 of
the 19 hijackers were Saudi---**[did not present the kind of existential
challenge evident today]{.underline}**. U.S. lawmakers are engaged in
numerous efforts to restrict arms sales to the kingdom and hold MbS,
along with other top officials, accountable for Khashoggi's death. For
now, the [Saudis are banking on the Trump administration's allegiance.
Yet they acknowledge, or at the very least pay lip service to, their
precarious position.]{.underline}

#### The Saudi alliance is key to contain Iranian aggression -- ending sales emboldens Iran and destabilizes the region.

Consider that [the United States' strategic [partnership
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia
has]{.mark}]{.underline} arguably [[never been more
productive.]{.mark}]{.underline} The young prince bin Salman has
committed to helping the Muslim nation that contains both Mecca and
Medina move towards a more just society and has already implemented
modest but meaningful reforms. Moreover, he has aided in Saudi's recent
softening of its stance towards Israel, stating that he believes the
Jewish people have a "right to their own land."

None of this should be overstated, and hopefulness for the young prince
to make good on his commitments should be tempered. But if the prince
can be encouraged to make reforms incrementally and with greater
prudence and consistency, it could portend positive developments not
only for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but also for the larger Muslim
world.

[[Saudi Arabia is]{.mark}]{.underline} famously [[the largest customer
of **American foreign military sales**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, this relationship is frequently disparaged as based on
greed and nothing more. No doubt American companies and therefore plenty
of Americans benefit directly from selling expensive military equipment
and weapons to other nations. But [[the primary reason that the United
States invests so heavily]{.mark} in Saudi Arabia [is because of its
strategic importance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [is a **crucial counterweight**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the Islamic Republic of
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}. Iran is a sworn enemy of the United States
and Israel. It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American
soldiers in Iraq, and for maiming countless other American warfighters
in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Iran regime oppresses its own people and
fails to invest in its own economy, because it has prioritized funding
Bashar al Assad's brutal civil war in Syria, enabling him to repeatedly
use chemical weapons on his own people.

[[Iran is a **constant destabilizing force**, seeking to
undermine]{.mark} the governments of sovereign nations like [Iraq and
Yemen.]{.mark} Although Saudi rightly receives flak for its]{.underline}
atrocious (and in many cases, avoidable) [civilian casualties in Yemen,
that war only exists because **[Iran is funding and arming the Houthi
rebels]{.mark}**. It is a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, in
which Iran is the aggressor]{.underline} and Saudi is the defender.
Last, and certainly not least, [[Iran continues to **fund and export
terrorism**]{.mark} in the Middle East and Europe.]{.underline}

[It is not too strong to say [Saudi Arabia is **our most important
strategic partner in mitigating**]{.mark} **and rolling back [Iran's
power]{.mark}** and malign activities.]{.underline} While true that [the
United States]{.underline} is becoming energy independent, it [is still
inextricably tied to the global market]{.underline} and our Asian allies
remain reliant on Golf petroleum. [[The **stability and diversification
of the energy market is a critical factor in matters of war**]{.mark}
and peace.]{.underline} [[Iran has repeatedly]{.mark} brandished its
ability to affect the energy market by]{.underline}, for example,
[[threatening to close]{.underline}]{.mark} the Strait of
[[Hormuz]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Saudi Arabia leads the Gulf coalition]{.mark} in maritime security [to
keep critical shipping lanes open]{.mark}. And [should the United
States]{.mark} and allies like Saudi Arabia [lose control]{.mark} of the
security of those shipping lanes, countries like Iran and its
increasingly bold partners --- large [nuclear powers China and
Russia]{.mark} --- [would be greatly empowered to more effectively
**blackmail and coerce the United States**]{.mark} and our
allies.]{.underline}

Every government of every sovereign nation is primarily responsible for
the care of its own people. The United States government must weigh all
of the above in order to determine what is the just thing to do for its
own citizens first, and also what effect its actions will have on its
allies, and even the impact on humanity in general.

[Damaging the U.S.-Saudi alliance will not]{.underline} decrease human
suffering, and will not [increase]{.underline} justice or peace and
[stability]{.underline} for Americans or for our allies. Heavy sanctions
on the Saudi government, **[[ending arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and military cooperation with Saudi, or demanding the House of Saud
remove bin Salman [[would play right into the hands of America's
enemies]{.mark}. Doing the moral thing does not require the United
States to advantage those who seek to harm us.]{.underline}

#### Iran-fueled instability causes great power war --- multiple scenarios for escalation.

**DiChristopher 18** (Tom DiChristopher is an award-winning multimedia
journalist who covers energy for CNBC.com. He previously coordinated
online coverage of broadcast guests for a number of CNBC\'s Business Day
programs. "Iran-Israel strikes show risk of Middle East war is growing
after US exit from nuclear deal," 5/10/18.
<https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/risk-of-war-in-the-middle-east-grows-after-us-exit-from-nuclear-deal.html>)

Middle East watchers warn that Trump\'s decision to abandon the nuclear
deal emboldens Israel and Saudi Arabia to take a more aggressive stance
against Iranian forces and proxies in the region. They say it also
marginalizes Iran\'s political moderates like President Hassan Rouhani
and emboldens the nation\'s hard-line conservatives and the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military organization loyal to the
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"US withdrawal from the JCPOA
could shift the balance of power among the Iranian leadership from those
who want to keep the deal operational to hardline elements more willing
to risk escalation by strengthening support for regional proxies, and
who favour economic self-sufficiency and opposed President Rouhani\'s
push for greater engagement with the West,\" ratings agency Fitch said
Thursday, referring to the deal by its official name, the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action. The long-standing fear is that [open
[military conflict among the Middle East\'s dominant players will
devolve into a regionwide conflict that drags **global powers** like the
United States and Russia **into war.** It could]{.mark} also [**choke
off oil supplies** from the world\'s largest]{.mark} energy export
[hub]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Israeli-Iranian exchange on Thursday is
only the latest flare up in [Syria\'s seven-year war that has drawn in
Russia, the United States, Kurdish fighters and Turkey. [The delicate
balance of alliances]{.mark} and competing interests [now risks
**tipping past the point of no return**]{.mark}, according to Helima
Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital
Markets.]{.underline} \"I very much worry that the [antagonists seem to
believe that this can be a managed and contained military escalation but
military planners thought the same thing in 1914]{.underline},\" she
wrote to CNBC. On Thursday, the White House condemned the Iranian
strikes and defended Israel\'s counterattack, calling it an act of
self-defense. It said Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard \"bears full
responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions.\" Beyond
Syria, [Iran is backing]{.underline} Lebanon\'s political and militant
group [Hezbollah]{.underline}, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization
and avowed enemy of Israel on the Jewish state\'s border. The Iranians
exercise significant influence over [militias in Iraq, and]{.underline}
Tehran is widely believed to be arming [Houthi rebels]{.underline} in
their fight against rivals in Yemen and a Saudi-led coalition that
includes the United States. To be sure, while the nuclear deal limited
Iran\'s program, President Barack [Obama\'s [hopes]{.mark} that the
accord would pave the way [for]{.mark} [improved relations proved
**overly optimistic**. Iran has only **ramped up its role in foreign
conflicts**]{.mark} since the deal took effect in 2016.]{.underline}
Now, in the wake of Trump\'s decision, an \"angry Iran is loose in the
region,\" risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a research note laying
out the potential consequences of the U.S. exit. \"[[In Yemen, Iran
will]{.mark} likely [encourage its Houthi allies to more aggressively
fire missiles]{.mark} at Saudi infrastructure]{.underline} and, more
importantly, transfer sophisticated systems to improve missile
accuracy,\" Eurasia Group analysts forecast. \"[[The
ris]{.mark}k]{.underline} of the deaths of Saudi citizens
[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark}, as does the risk
[[of]{.mark}]{.underline} a tough and **[[escalatory Saudi
response]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" However, it\'s the Syrian conflict
where Eurasia Group sees the highest risk of volatility. \"As we
expected, Israel has ratcheted up airstrikes against Iranian targets,
seeking to thwart the establishment of Revolutionary Guard bases
throughout Syria,\" its analysts said. [The heightened [political risks
could]{.mark} also **[inflame other tensions]{.mark} tied to Iran [that
have roiled the Arabian Peninsula]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Fitch warned.
It notes that a blockade by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on
Qatar is largely due to the tiny Gulf nation\'s ties to Iran. It points
out that Oman has been accused of allowing Iran to funnel weapons
through its country to neighboring Yemen, and that Bahrain pointed the
finger at Tehran-linked terrorism for a domestic oil pipeline attack.
Closely followed trader Art Cashin said [geopolitical concerns in the
Middle East are now eclipsing those over **North Korea**]{.underline},
whose leader will meet with Trump on June 12 after talks with South
Korea that have begun to defuse a nuclear crisis. \"I would keep an eye
on the Middle East a good deal more than North Korea,\" he told CNBC\'s
\"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday. [\"I get the feeling as you watch
what\'s going on in North Korea that the Chinese are very involved in
making sure that this thing comes off, so [if there\'s going to be a
concern, it\'s going to be the **Middle East**]{.mark},\"]{.underline}
said Cashin, director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange
for UBS.

#### The Saudi alliance is key to regional stability -- coop deters Iran, maintains energy security, and stabilizes Yemen -- stopping arms sales turns the case.

**Cordesman 18** \[Anthony Cordesman, chair in strategy at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, 3-21-2018, \"Saudi Arabia is a
critical American security partner in the Middle East,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/379542-saudi-arabia-is-a-critical-american-security-partner-in-the-middle-east\]

Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten that [**[our
strategy in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia]{.mark} as our
most important single security partner**.]{.underline} Israel's security
is certainly a key American concern, but it does not play an active role
in most of America's ongoing military engagements in the region, in
dealing with Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist
movements like ISIS and Al Qaeda.

[[Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner has]{.mark} also [been
enhanced by the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their]{.mark}
own [internal stability]{.mark}]{.underline} and their roles in the
region have sharply diminished, [and Iraq and Syria both must deal with
major instability]{.underline} problems and are at war. [Our European
allies have declining power projection capabilities]{.underline}, and
Turkey's role in the region is increasingly problematic.

It is certainly true that Saudi Arabia needs the United States as much
or more than the United States needs Saudi Arabia. [[Saudi military
forces are]{.mark} [steadily improving,]{.mark} [but]{.mark} it is the
[U.S. presence]{.mark} in the region that [create a balance of forces
that]{.mark} firmly [deters Iran]{.mark} and has helped Saudi Arabia
defeat its own terrorist threats]{.underline} from groups like Al Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula. U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts and
exercises also play a critical role in improving Saudi forces.

But [the United States needs Saudi Arabia]{.underline} as well. [[Saudi
Arabia is now the **most**]{.mark} **critical [single security
partner]{.mark} in ensuring the stable flow of petroleum** out of the
Gulf]{.underline} region. While the United States is largely eliminating
its need for direct petroleum imports, it is steadily increasing its
dependence on the health and growth of the global economy and imports
from Asian states like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are
critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports. The end result is that
[U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to increase in spite of
the steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports.]{.underline}

This is why focusing on more U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi
investment in the United States, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia
has played in fight terrorism since 2003, down playing the need to
cooperate in checking Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi
Arabia does not face real threats is not the way the United States
should deal with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the White
House.

[[Saudi Arabia's reform]{.mark} and economic development [plans are
**critical to its stability**]{.mark} **[and the region's
security]{.mark}**. The kingdom needs U.S. encouragement
and]{.underline} an understanding that [[Saudi Arabia cannot implement
these plans effectively]{.mark} [without outside
support]{.mark}.]{.underline} The burden sharing argument has become
absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be treated as a source of ready money every
time the United States has a need.

It is already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on security,
which is three times the economic burden security places on the United
States. This spending is too high given the kingdom's other needs, and
the United States should be focusing on better ways to make its security
partnerships with Saudi Arabia, as well as the other Gulf states and
Jordan more efficient and less costly, not simply on spending more.

At the same time, [[Iran is all too real a threat.]{.mark} Effective
**[joint action in dealing with Iran's nuclear programs]{.mark}**,
its]{.underline} ballistic and cruise [missile programs, its asymmetric
threats to Gulf shipping, [and **expending military influence in the
region** are]{.mark} all [critical]{.mark} common [U.S. and Saudi
priorities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [also badly needs to find
some common approach to dealing with Iraq and Syria that will move both
towards recovery and lasting stability, limit Iranian and Russian
influence as much as possible]{.underline}, and help stabilize relations
with Turkey. There are no easy options in either case, but **[[Saudi
Arabia is the key potential Arab partner]{.mark} any such
efforts.]{.underline}**

The United States, especially members of Congress, needs to remember
that we have had at least as many military problems in fighting the Iraq
and Syria wars as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have faced
in fighting in Yemen. [[Cutting U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia may
do little more]{.mark} [that **lead the Saudis to ignore the systems
that the U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates [has helped set up]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}to limit targeting of civilians and using unguided and more
damaging air munitions. [It]{.mark} [raises]{.mark} a whole [new]{.mark}
round of [questions about]{.mark} **the [U.S commitment]{.mark} to its
partners in the region.**]{.underline}

[[We need]{.mark} to **forge [a common solution]{.mark} in Yemen, [not a
decoupling]{.mark}** that leaves Saudi Arabia exposed.]{.underline}
[[This]{.mark} would fail in both military and human rights terms, and
[leaves]{.mark} both [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and Saudi
Arabia [with no options for dealing]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the Houthi or
[Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}, seeking [ways to end the war, dealing with
Al Qaida]{.underline} or the other terrorist movements in Yemen, [and
**without any means to help Yemen back to some form of
stability**]{.underline} and development.

These challenges are also are reasons why [the United States should do
as much as possible to persuade]{.underline} [M]{.underline}ohammed
[B]{.underline}in [S]{.underline}alman [to end the divisions that have
led Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the United Arab Emirates [to split
with Qatar]{.underline}, and to rising tensions with Oman. [More unity
between the southern Gulf states in **dealing with Iran and terrorism**
can do far more to help the United states]{.underline} than more arms
sales. Finally, more interoperability, common facilities and cooperation
are key to countering Iran.

We need to take this visit seriously, and stop focusing on pomp and
deals. [The United States is highly unlikely to find a better Saudi
leader for reform and change in Saudi Arabia during the next decade, or
one more committed to improving Saudi security in ways that serve the
common interests of both the United States and Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline}

### Trump Won't leave = probs

#### Trump wouldn't hand over power peacefully- he's already states plans to change the Constitution to serve more than 2 terms

**Cillizza '19** (Chris, American political commentator for CNN, "What
happens if Donald Trump refuses to admit he lost in 2020?" CNN Politics,
May 6 2019,
https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/donald-trump-2020-election/index.html)/ly

[Trump won't]{.underline} leave Recalling her mindset in advance of the
2018 midterms, Pelosi told the New York Times: \"If we win by four
seats, by a thousand votes each, he\'s not going to [respect the
election]{.underline}. \[Trump\] would poison the public mind. He would
challenge each of the races; he would say you can\'t seat these
people,\" she added. \"We had to win. Imagine if we hadn\'t won --- oh,
don\'t even imagine. So, as we go forward, we have to have the same
approach.\" That might sound like exaggeration from Pelosi \-- an
attempt to gin up her base in advance of the 2020 presidential election.
It isn\'t. Since the moment he won the White House in November 2016,
[Trump has shown a willingness]{.underline} \-- actually more of a
proclivity \-- [to entertain the idea that there is some]{.underline}
sort of broad [conspiracy]{.underline} aimed at [trying to
disenfranchise conservative voters]{.underline}. Less than a month after
his 2016 victory, Trump launched this Twitter tirade: \"In addition to
winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if
you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally It would have been
much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral
College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15
states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and
convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" Trump didn\'t then
\-- and hasn\'t since \-- offered any evidence for that claim. (He lost
the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by just under 3 million, the largest
popular vote deficit ever for a president who won the Electoral College
but lost the popular vote.) He convened a commission to study alleged
election fraud \-- of which study after study has shown simply doesn\'t
exist in any sort of widespread manner \-- but eventually disbanded it.
What [Trump hasn\'t abandoned]{.underline} is [his belief]{.underline}
that \-- some how, some way \-- Republicans (and him in particular)
aren\'t getting a fair shake in these elections. \"In many places the
same person in California votes many times,\" Trump said at the official
White House event in West Virginia on tax cuts in April 2018. \"They
always like to say, \'Oh that\'s a conspiracy theory.\' It\'s not a
conspiracy theory. Millions and millions of people and it\'s very hard
because the state guards their records.\" (He offered no proof to back
up this claim.) Earlier this year, speaking at a fundraiser for the
House Republican campaign arm, [Trump]{.underline} again [raised the
specter that his side was being cheated]{.underline}. \"We\'ve gotta
watch those vote tallies. You know, I keep hearing about the election
and the various counting measures that they have.\" He added that
Democrats won all of the close elections in 2018; \"There\'s something
going on,\" he said, telling the assembled lawmakers that they needed to
\"be a little bit more paranoid than you are, OK?\" (He offered no proof
to back up this claim.) The point here is that [Trump has a long record
of making]{.underline} wholly [unsubstantiated claims about election
results]{.underline}. And that includes doing so in an election \-- 2016
\-- in which he won! [It\'s not]{.underline} much of [a
stretch]{.underline} then [to imagine that Trump]{.underline},
[if]{.underline} he does come up [short in]{.underline} the
[2020]{.underline} election, [wouldn\'t be willing to]{.underline}
simply [go quietly]{.underline} into that good night. For Trump,
[refusing to admit defeat]{.underline} [and hand over power voluntarily
would be the final]{.underline} sacred [cow he could
slaughter]{.underline}. He\'s built a political career on a willingness
to break with long-held traditions, the venerated elements of our
capital \"D\" democracy that have long distinguished us from the rest of
the world. [Trump]{.underline} scoffs at all that sort of stuff, the
trappings, he [would argue, of an arcane system put in place by elites
who can\'t channel the will of the people]{.underline} like he can. If
you think that\'s overstating things, it\'s worth noting that [Trump
has]{.underline} repeatedly \"[joked\" about changing the Constitution
to]{.underline} allow him to [serve more than two terms]{.underline} as
president. Last month, in accepting a gift from the Wounded Warrior
Project, [Trump \"joked]{.underline}\": \"Well, this is really
beautiful. This will find a permanent place, [at least for six
years]{.underline}, in the Oval Office. Is that OK? I was going to joke,
General, and say at least for 10 or 14 years, but we would cause bedlam
if I said that, so we\'ll say six.\" In a closed-door speech to
Republican donors last year in Florida, [Trump said]{.underline} this of
Chinese President Xi Jinping: \"[He\'s now president for
life]{.underline}. President for life. No, he\'s great. And look, he was
able to do that. I think it\'s great. Maybe we\'ll have to give that a
shot some day.\" And then there was this \"joke\" from Trump in a speech
to Members of Congress touting his tax law in 2018: \"We\'re cutting
record numbers of regulations --- we\'ve cut more regulations in a year
and a quarter than any administration whether it\'s four years, eight
years, or in one case 16 years,\" Trump said. \"Should we go back to 16
years? Should we do that? Congressman can we do that?\" HA HA HA
HA\...wait a minute.

#### Trump's sole concern for winning 2020 makes the chance of him starting a violent rally high 

**Hasan '19** (Mehdi, British political journalist, broadcaster and
author, 'Yes, Let's Defeat or Impeach Donald Trump. But What If He
Refuses to Leave the White House?" The Intercept, March 6 2019,
https://theintercept.com/2019/03/06/donald-trump-impeachment-2020/)/ly

Enter, however, Donald [Trump]{.underline}. The 45th president of the
United States [has made clear that he does not give a damn about
political, legal, or constitutional norms]{.underline}; [his only
concern is]{.underline} with [winning at all costs]{.underline}. When
running for office in 2016, he refused to commit to accepting the result
of the presidential election. After emerging victorious, he baselessly
claimed to have "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of
people who voted illegally." In the wake of the 2018 midterms, he
ridiculously suggested that Republican losses were a result of
"potentially illegal votes" involving people changing their clothes to
vote multiple times, and falsely accused Democrats of trying to "steal"
the Senate and gubernatorial elections in Florida. Trump has been laying
the groundwork for 2020. Think about it: [Why would a president who has
**violated** a number of U.S. **laws,** traditions, and
norms]{.underline} --- [from **obstructing justice**]{.underline}, [to
defying the emoluments clause, to threatening the free press, to
inciting violence]{.underline} --- [show any deference to Article II,
Section 1 of the Constitution]{.underline}? [Consider this]{.underline}
scenario: On the morning of November 3, 2020, it becomes clear that
[Trump]{.underline} has lost both the electoral college and the popular
vote to the Democratic candidate, whoever they may be. The president,
however, [rather than calling his Democratic opponent to
concede]{.underline}, [holds a rally]{.underline} with his supporters
[at which he declares himself the winner]{.underline}, tells the crowd
"what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,"
[slams the "fake news]{.underline}" media, and claims "millions and
millions" of people voted illegally for the Democrats. [He denounces a
"deep state" coup and warns of "violence]{.underline}." Do you really
think this isn't possible? That this potential scenario shouldn't make
us all very afraid? This is a man, after all, who point-blank refused to
accept that he lost the popular vote when he won the presidency in 2016
--- so why should we assume that he would accept the result of an
election that he loses? On Tuesday, Kayleigh McEnany, the national press
secretary for Trump's re-election campaign, even tweeted out a statement
that "desperate Democrats know they cannot beat President Trump in
2020... that they have zero chance of winning legitimately." REMEMBER,
[THERE ARE multiple reasons why Trump might cry foul]{.underline} [and
refuse to concede come 2020,]{.underline} and why he might also believe
he could get away with it. [First,]{.underline} there [is his
personality]{.underline}. [Trump is a malignant narcissist who values
himself]{.underline} and his own advancement [over]{.underline} everyone
and [everything else]{.underline}. Using and [abusing his presidential
powers to protect his prestige]{.underline} and position [would be "very
tempting]{.underline}" for him, to quote professor Bandy Lee, a forensic
psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine and editor of the 2017 book
"The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health
Experts Assess a President." "When you have extreme narcissism," Lee
told me on my podcast, "Deconstructed," last month, "the danger of it is
that one can quickly go to resorting to violence and resorting to
extreme measures to move away from the possibility of humiliation and to
project force." [Second, there's the possibility of prison]{.underline}.
Right now, [Trump is protected by Justice Department]{.underline}
guidelines that say a sitting president cannot be indicted or
prosecuted. Got that? A sitting president. Not a former president. As
Trump supporter Chris Christie told CNN last week,
[prosecutors]{.underline} from the Southern District of New York [are
trying to build a case "against the president for when he leaves
office]{.underline}." So why agree to leave office? Third, [there are
the president's friends and allies]{.underline}, [who will
be]{.underline} loudly [urging him to stay on and fight]{.underline}
while whipping up grassroots fervor on his behalf. Asked about the
prospect of impeachment, in September 2017, for example, Trump confidant
Roger Stone responded, "You will have a spasm of violence in this
country, an insurrection like you've never seen." In December 2017,
Stone and fellow far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones --- who Trump
has praised as "amazing" --- filmed themselves at a shooting range and
posted the video to Jones's YouTube channel with the title "Roger Stone
Prepares For Civil War After Trump Is Removed From Office: LIVE AUTO
GUNFIRE."

incapable of admitting defeat. This doesn't bode well for the 2020
presidential election. Why Donald Trump could win again, by Dave Eggers
Read more [Among the most chilling words uttered this week by Michael
Cohen, Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer, were "given my
experience working for Mr Trump I fear that if he loses the election in
2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of
power,]{.underline} and this is why I agreed to appear before you
today". Cohen should know better than anyone, but we already had reason
to worry. In 2016, when polls showed Hillary Clinton with a wide lead,
Trump claimed the election was rigged against him[. He refused to commit
to honoring the election results if he lost]{.underline}, warning that
he'd "reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case
of a questionable result". He added that he would accept the results of
the election "if I win". [For Trump, losing is the deepest form of
humiliation, and humiliation is intolerable Throughout the summer of
2016, Trump's claim of election rigging was echoed on Fox
News.]{.underline} Newt Gingrich spoke of "a long tradition on the part
of Democratic machines of trying to steal elections". Rudolph Giuliani
declared "Hillary and \[Tim\] Kaine are right in the middle of the
Washington insider rigged system". Trump's campaign manager at the time,
Paul Manafort, said federal officials couldn't be trusted to prevent
voter fraud, warning that "if you're relying on the justice department
to ensure the security of the elections, we have to be worried". By
early August 2016, according to a Bloomberg poll, 56% of Trump
supporters believed the election would be rigged. (Among all voters,
only 34% predicted a rigged election; 60% rejected the idea.) 1:28 Trump
loyalists will \'suffer same consequences I'm suffering\', says Cohen --

the popular vote.]{.underline} Still claiming election fraud, he
established a presidential commission to find it. When the commission
came back empty-handed, he abruptly dissolved it, saying -- wrongly --
that it had uncovered "substantial evidence of voter fraud". No such
evidence emerged. The latest major Trump resignations and firings Read
more For Trump, losing is the deepest form of humiliation, and
humiliation is intolerable. [Every time he has lost a legislative or
legal battle during his presidency he has blamed the other side, and has
lashed back: shuttering the government, declaring a national emergency,
whipping up his followers against recalcitrant judges, Democrats, the
media or whomever he holds responsible. Imagine it's November 2020 and
Trump has lost the election. He charges voter fraud, claiming that the
"deep state" organized tens of millions of illegal immigrants to vote
against him, and says he has an obligation not to step down. Only this
time he's already president, with all the powers a president
commands.]{.underline} In years past, Americans have trusted our system
of government enough that we abide by its outcomes even though we may
disagree with them. [Only once in our history -- in 1861 -- did enough
of us distrust the system so much we succumbed to civil
war.]{.underline} Typically, when an election is over, the peaceful
transition of power reminds the public that our allegiance is not toward
a particular person but to our system of government. Five weeks after
the bitterly contested election of 2000, and just one day after the
supreme court ruled 5-4 in favor of George W Bush, Al Gore graciously
declared: "I say to president-elect Bush that what remains of partisan
rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this
country." [But what happens if an incumbent president claims our system
is no longer trustworthy? Trump's emissaries have already seeded the
battlefield.]{.underline} Last April, Sean Hannity of Fox News predicted
that [an attempt to]{.underline} impeach Trump (or presumably [remove
him from office]{.underline} any other way) [would cause "fighting and
dividing this country at a level we've never seen ... those that stand
for truth and those that literally buy into the corrupt deep state
attacks against a duly elected president".]{.underline} Trump is a
national security risk -- and still Republicans back him Walter Shapiro
Read more Trump's former consiglieri [Roger Stone has warned of "an
insurrection like you've never seen" and claimed that any politician who
voted to oust Trump "would be endangering their own life". Just last
week, Steve Bannon,]{.underline} another of Trump's bottom-feeders[,
predicted that "2019 is going to be the most vitriolic year in American
politics since the civil war, and I include Vietnam in that". He didn't
make a prediction about 2020, but we can guess.]{.underline} We should
take seriously Michael Cohen's admonition that [if Trump is defeated in
2020, he will not leave office peacefully.]{.underline} Republican
leaders as well as supreme court justices and civic and religious
leaders across the land must be prepared to assert the primacy of our
system of government over the will of the man who refuses to lose.

IT IS A question that has been bothering me for many months now: [What
if Donald Trump is defeated in November 2020]{.underline}, or impeached
before then, [but refuses to leave office?]{.underline} Last week we
discovered it's a question that also bothers Trump's former personal
lawyer. In his concluding statement before the House Oversight
Committee, [Michael Cohen issued this ominous warning: "I fear that if
he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful
transition of power.]{.underline} And this is why I agreed to appear
before you today." To be clear: Since the first handover of the White
House from one party to another, back in 1801, there has never not been
a peaceful transition of power in the United States. There have been
close calls --- including the Compromise of 1877 and, of course, George
W. Bush vs. Al Gore in 2000 --- but the system has always worked. Even
Richard Nixon, to whom Trump is oft-compared, conceded to John F.
Kennedy in 1960, despite numerous accusations of vote-rigging by the
Democrats. "In our campaigns," the then-sitting vice president told
Congress, "no matter how hard they may be, no matter how close the
election may turn out to be, those who lose accept the verdict and
support those who win." In 1981, Ronald Reagan referred to the "orderly
transfer of authority" in the U.S. as "nothing less than a miracle."

consequential news of the week. Listen and subscribe. Enter, however,
Donald Trump. [The 45th president of the United States has made clear
that he does not give a damn about political, legal, or constitutional
norms; his only concern is with winning at all costs. When running for
office in 2016, he refused to commit to accepting the result of the
presidential election.]{.underline} After emerging victorious, he
baselessly claimed to have "won the popular vote if you deduct the
millions of people who voted illegally." [In the wake of the 2018
midterms, he ridiculously suggested that Republican losses were a result
of "potentially illegal votes]{.underline}" involving people changing
their clothes to vote multiple times, and falsely accused Democrats of
trying to "steal" the Senate and gubernatorial elections in Florida.
Donald J. Trump ✔ \@realDonaldTrump Trying to STEAL two big elections in
Florida! We are watching closely! 115K 12:09 PM - Nov 10, 2018 Twitter
Ads info and privacy 68.6K people are talking about this [Trump has been
laying the groundwork for 2020. Think about it: Why would a president
who has violated a number of U.S. laws, traditions, and norms --- from
obstructing justice, to defying the emoluments clause, to threatening
the free press, to inciting violence --- show any deference to Article
II, Section 1 of the Constitution? Consider this scenario: On the
morning of November 3, 2020, it becomes clear that Trump has
lost]{.underline} both the electoral college and the popular vote to the
Democratic candidate, whoever they may be. [The president, however,
rather than calling his Democratic opponent to concede, holds a rally
with his supporters at which he declares himself the winner, tells the
crowd "what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's
happening," slams the "fake news" media]{.underline}, and claims
"millions and millions" of people voted illegally for the Democrats. He
denounces a "deep state" coup and warns of "violence." Do you really
think this isn't possible? That this potential scenario shouldn't make
us all very afraid? [This is a man, after all, who point-blank refused
to accept that he lost the popular vote when he won the presidency in
2016]{.underline} --- so why should we assume that he would accept the
result of an election that he loses? On Tuesday, Kayleigh McEnany, [the
national press secretary]{.underline} for Trump's re-election campaign,
[even tweeted out a statement that "desperate Democrats know they cannot
beat President Trump in 2020... that they have zero chance of winning
legitimately."]{.underline} REMEMBER, THERE ARE multiple reasons why
Trump might cry foul and refuse to concede come 2020, and why he might
also believe he could get away with it. First, there is his personality.
[Trump is a malignant narcissist who values himself and his own
advancement over everyone and everything else. Using and abusing his
presidential powers to protect his prestige and position would be "very
tempting" for him, to quote professor Bandy Lee, a forensic
psychiatrist]{.underline} at the Yale School of Medicine and editor of
the 2017 book "The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and
Mental Health Experts Assess a President." "When you have extreme
narcissism," Lee told me on my podcast, "Deconstructed," last month,
"the danger of it is that one can quickly go to resorting to violence
and resorting to extreme measures to move away from the possibility of
humiliation and to project force." [Second, there's the possibility of
prison. Right now, Trump is protected by Justice Department guidelines
that say a sitting president cannot be indicted or prosecuted. Got that?
A sitting president. Not a former president]{.underline}. As Trump
supporter Chris Christie told CNN last week, prosecutors from the
Southern District of New York are trying to build a case "against the
president for when he leaves office." So why agree to leave office?
[Third, there are the president's friends and allies, who will be loudly
urging him to stay on and fight while whipping up grassroots fervor on
his behalf.]{.underline} Asked about the prospect of impeachment, in
September 2017, for example, Trump confidant Roger Stone responded, "You
will have a spasm of violence in this country, an insurrection like
you've never seen." In December 2017, Stone and fellow far-right
conspiracy theorist Alex Jones --- who Trump has praised as "amazing"
--- filmed themselves at a shooting range and posted the video to
Jones's YouTube channel with the title "[Roger Stone Prepares For Civil
War After Trump Is Removed From]{.underline} Office: LIVE AUTO GUNFIRE."
Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered
to you. I'm in How about Fox News? We know the far-right cable network
exerts massive influence over this president --- to quote from a recent
Vox headline, "Fox News demanded a government shutdown --- and got one."
[Fox hosts have accused the "deep state" of plotting to "destroy the
presidency of Donald Trump"; denounced a "coup" attempt against the
president;]{.underline} and suggested Justice Department officials be
"led out in cuffs." [Why wouldn't they demand Trump hang on, and tell
their viewers to back the (defeated) president? Could we rely on
congressional Republicans to rediscover their backbones and insist he
stand down? Don't. Be. Silly. How about Republican voters? Well,
three-quarters (75 percent) of them trust Trump over the media, while
more than half (52 percent) support postponing the 2020 election. Would
the generals step in? Maybe. But how would the Secret Service react? And
what do the Democrats plan to do if Trump uses his presidential bully
pulpit, in the weeks and months after the election, to incite riots and
spread falsehoods about illegal immigrants and the "deep
state"?]{.underline} Would leading media organizations, obsessed as they
are with both sides-ism, have the courage to call out a GOP
dictator-in-waiting? These are some of the questions that at least need
to be asked right now --- even if there might not be any obvious
answers. [We have to listen to Cohen. This is not a drill, and there is
no reason to believe Trump will go quietly if he is
defeated]{.underline}. There is every reason, however, to believe he and
his allies will incite hysteria and even violence. Those who assume
otherwise haven't been paying attention.

Brandon) Trump: We all share an extraordinary heritage (CNN)There have
been numerous contested elections in US history, including as recently
as 2000, when the Supreme Court essentially called it for George W.
Bush. [What there hasn\'t been is a sitting President who refused to
accept the results. **The so-called peaceful transfer of power is a key
ingredient of the American political experiment.**]{.underline} Most
famous is the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr
tied in Electoral Votes and spent six days politicking in the House of
Representatives until the tie was broken. In 1824, Andrew Jackson \--
Donald Trump\'s favorite president \-- had the most popular votes and
the most electors, although not a majority of either, but the House gave
the White House to John Quincy Adams, who then made speaker of the House
Henry Clay his Secretary of State, which Jackson called \"a corrupt
bargain,\" according to a House website on close elections. But Jackson
waited it out and ran again, winning four years later. Play Video Trump:
My election most similar to Jackson\'s 01:16 In 1876, after widespread
allegations of voter fraud in the South, Congress set up a commission
that voted along party lines to give the presidency to Ohio Gov.
Rutherford B. Hayes, who won neither the popular vote nor the Electoral
College against New York Gov. Samuel Tilden. The compromise that put
Hayes in office was reached just days before he was inaugurated. It also
signaled a retreat for Reconstruction. In 1888, a vote-buying scandal
didn\'t sink former senator and Republican Benjamin Harrison\'s
candidacy, although he narrowly lost the popular vote. President Grover
Cleveland, the Democrat, did not dispute the results, although he
defeated Harrison four years later, the only former President to run
serve non-consecutive terms. Richard Nixon accepted an extremely narrow
defeat in 1960 despite allegations of fraud in Illinois and Al Gore
ultimately accepted the Supreme Court\'s decision to end a Florida
recount in 2000. [President Donald Trump has signaled in the past few
days that challenging the legitimacy of the 2020 election is the latest
way he\'s prepared to break all precedent \-- and stress-test but the
Constitution and the country. The concerns are real enough that one
former National Security Council lawyer wrote for CNN in February that
lawmakers should start asking Pentagon officials to swear they will
respect the election winner on January 21, 2021, even if that person is
not Trump.]{.underline} \"It\'s worth asking the Secretary of Defense
and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as they testify before
Congress in coming months, to affirm that they understand that and would
act consistently with it,\" wrote Joshua Geltzer, a former deputy legal
adviser for the National Security Council, in a recent piece for CNN.
[Trump\'s long-term skepticism of the electoral process Paranoia has
been an organizing principle of President Donald Trump\'s politics. He
entered the 2016 election bracing for defeat and pre-emptively arguing
the election was rigged against him and that millions of people were
registered to vote illegally (there\'s no evidence for any of
this).]{.underline} When he defied his own expectations and won, [his
allegations]{.underline} of a rigged election turned into allegations of
voter fraud that cost him the popular vote (again, zero evidence of
this), and [that a deep state of entrenched bureaucrats was out to get
him]{.underline}. That turned into allegations that President Barack
Obama had spied on him (those have been fact-checked) and that the
special counsel investigating Russia election interference was a \"witch
hunt.\" [The theme here is that there is always someone or something out
to get Trump and the deck is stacked against him, the fact of which must
be the bedrock of any hypotheticals about November 2020,]{.underline}
when he\'s due to be on the ballot, and January 2021, when either he
will take his second oath of office or he\'ll watch a Democrat take over
for him. [Trump thinks his presidency has been \"stollen\"]{.underline}
Over the weekend Trump asserted on Twitter that two years of his
presidency had been stolen. [Trump was seconding a tweet first posted by
a top supporter of his, Jerry Falwell Jr., who made a joke (this is a

documented that these types of comments are not a one-off. The President
talks (jokes?) about staying in the White House a lot. [Pelosi worries
Trump won\'t respect 2020 results]{.underline} Trump won\'t really have
to worry about impeachment in the current climate for two reasons: House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who controls what Democrats vote on in the House,
has said repeatedly that impeachment is not the best way to remove Trump
from office Even if, somehow, House Democrats moved to impeach Trump,
Republicans control the Senate and none of them seem likely to vote to
remove him from office Still, Pelosi also told the New York Times over
the weekend that she wants Democrats to take a more moderate lane in
2020 so that they can beat Trump \"big.\" Otherwise, she said, she
worries he will be able to deny the results. \"[We have to inoculate
against that, we have to be prepared for that,\"]{.underline} she told
the Times. She had a similar concern in 2018, during the midterm
election in which Democrats took control of the House. \"[If we win by
four seats, by a thousand votes each, he\'s not going to respect the
election]{.underline},\" she said of her thinking at the time and how
she worried he would challenge their majority if it had been slimmer.
\"[He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the
races; he would say you can\'t seat these people,]{.underline}\" she
added. \"We had to win. Imagine if we hadn\'t won --- oh, don\'t even
imagine. So, as we go forward, we have to have the same approach.\"
That\'s Pelosi imploring Democrats to embrace a middle road and not
politics Trump can dismiss as radical. But it\'s also a valid question
about what Trump will do if he loses in 2020. [Other politicians have
lately questioned the fairness of elections]{.underline}. That includes
Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost in her bid to be governor of Georgia
and has refused to accept the results that put Brian Kemp into the
office. As Georgia\'s Secretary of State during the 2016 race, Kemp
oversaw the state\'s election and Abrams has alleged a campaign of voter
suppression that cost her a victory. Play Video [Abrams used a
nationally televised speech to call voter suppression a \'threat to
democracy\']{.underline} 01:19 [But Abrams, a Yale-educated lawyer,
ultimately accepted the results and is now focusing her attention on
protecting the voting rights of minorities. Trump has different
inclinations]{.underline}. He has certainly shown no compunction about
pushing the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton. [There
is no distinction between the person and the Presidency in his mind,
which was clear from reports James Comey\'s that Trump demands ultimate
loyalty to himself from subordinates]{.underline}. It\'s also present in
the criticism that his current attorney general, William Barr, has acted
in the President\'s interests, rather than the country\'s, with how
he\'s slow-walked release of the Mueller report. The end result is that
Trump could have loyalists in his administration come Election Day.
[Trump wouldn\'t commit to honoring a loss]{.underline} Trump: I&#39;ll
accept election results &#39;if I win&#39; Trump: I\'ll accept election
results \'if I win\' 04:24 [Back in 2016]{.underline}, at a presidential
debate with Hillary Clinton just before Election Day, he would not
commit to respecting the results. \"I will look at it at the time. I\'m
not looking at anything now, I\'ll look at it at the time,\" [he said,
complaining that the media had poisoned the minds of voters and making
his unsubstantiated claims about millions of people who shouldn\'t be
voting. Wallace pointed out the peaceful transfer of power from one
party to the next is a key element of the US political
system]{.underline}. \"Are you saying you\'re not prepared now to commit
to that principle?\" he asked Trump. \"What I\'m saying is that I will
tell you at the time. [I\'ll keep you in suspense, okay?\" the
then-candidate said. Now he\'s President and he\'s already laid the
groundwork for arguing a loss is not fair to him. This question -
whether Trump will accept the results, is going to come up again, for
sure.]{.underline} He\'s in the White House and in control of the US
military and the country\'s national security apparatus. Those
organizations should honor their oath to uphold the Constitution, but
[if Trump were to reject the results, it would certainly create chaos
and set up a historic strain on the US government.]{.underline}

#### The impact is the collapse of American democracy.

But while nationwide cheating may be impossible, [the Republican Party
has proven more than willing to violate democratic norms where it has
local control, and not every powerful institution is as neutral as the
military. There is a sequence of events, each individually plausible,
that would allow Trump to remain president despite losing the
election---breaking American democracy in the process.]{.underline} "[I
think we know that Trump will certainly, no matter what the result is,
be likely to declare that there was fraud and that he was the rightful
victor]{.underline}," said Joseph Fishkin, a law professor at the
University of Texas who studies elections. Let's assume that Fishkin is
right. Here's what could keep Trump in power. 1. The election is close.
If Trump lost in a blowout, alleging fraud would accomplish little. Even
entrenched autocrats are often forced from office when they are heftily
defeated. But that doesn't mean the race would need to be a redux of
2000, when George W. Bush won the presidency with an official margin of
537 votes, to spark a crisis. [Given increasing polarization and the
Republican Party's growing impatience with democratic norms, experts
told me the party might challenge even a clear defeat]{.underline}. "I
am worried now, given the reaction to 2018, that you could get a dispute
over a five-digit number," said Edward Foley, a law professor and
elections expert at Ohio State University. Others suggested the margin
could be even wider. When I asked Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law
professor at Harvard University, just how close the election would have
to be for Republicans to support Trump in disputing the results, he
said, " 'Close'---as Trump supporters define it." However you construe
the word, a close election is well within the realm of possibility. In
2016, Trump won his three pivotal states---Pennsylvania, Michigan, and
Wisconsin---by five-digit numbers. Indeed, most of the country's
twenty-first-century elections have hinged on a few states with narrow
margins. "\[2020\] will probably be a nail-biter election where the
polls are mixed or indeterminate, where it's really not clear who is
going to win," said Levitsky. "[If it's close, just as Trump kind of did
in 2018, Trump could basically claim fraud. And we don't really have
mechanisms to deal with that." 2. Trump claims fraud, and Republicans
back him up.]{.underline} It is Wednesday morning, November 4, 2020. At
7:15 a.m., after a stressful night of watching the returns trickle in,
the Associated Press projects that the Democratic presidential candidate
will win Pennsylvania, and, with it, the presidency. Sure enough, it's a
narrow victory---279 electoral votes to 258. When all is said and done,
the Democrat wins Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by only about
77,000 votes combined, the same amount Trump won those states by in
2016. Donald Trump, who spent the past five months warning about fraud,
has been eerily silent for most of the night. [But as soon as the
Democrat takes the stage to give her victory speech, he unleashes a
barrage of tweets claiming that over 100,000 illegal immigrants voted in
Michigan and that Philadelphia kept its polls open for hours later than
allowed. "Without PHONY voters, I really won!" he tweets. "This is
FRAUD!"]{.underline} Needless to say, the president does not call to
congratulate his opponent. At an afternoon press conference, [Trump's
press secretary announces he will not concede.]{.underline} What happens
next? "In the best-case scenario, key Republicans would either talk him
down or defect from Trump and say, 'He's wrong,' " Levitsky said. Most
of the academics I spoke with also thought that this was likely. "I'm
just having trouble wrapping my head around even this polarized and
often radicalized Republican Party going along with that," said Mickey.
"This is kind of the limit condition of scenarios and surprise." But
they acknowledged that defections were far from guaranteed[. "Trump is
still far and away the most popular Republican," Levitsky said. "If Sean
Hannity is claiming fraud on television and Rush Limbaugh is claiming
fraud and Mitch McConnell is not willing to stand up and say, 'No, there
was no fraud,' then we could have a real crisis."]{.underline}
Unfortunately, that's exactly what takes place[. After forty-eight hours
of silence, the Senate majority leader issues a terse press release in
which he says he "recognizes the president's serious concerns" about the
election's integrity.]{.underline} Some GOP representatives do break
ranks and call for Trump to concede (I'm looking at you, Mitt Romney),
but most stay silent or back the president's claims. In a monumental act
of gaslighting, Lindsey Graham tells reporters that Democrats are the
ones undermining democracy. "They are afraid of a thorough investigation
into the fairness of this election," he declares. "They'll stop at
nothing to get this president out of office." [3. Polarized courts side
with the GOP. Almost everyone I spoke with told me that, at this point,
the election results would be challenged in court]{.underline}. The
Trump campaign might sue Democratic-leaning counties for alleged
"irregularities" and ask that judges toss out their results. "I can
imagine the litigation in Pennsylvania taking the form of saying voting
booths in Philadelphia were held open an excessively long time, an
unlawfully long time, or the vote counters in some Democratic-leaning
county unlawfully refused to count late-filed absentee ballots," Tushnet
said. [Victory for Trump would "mean throwing out the ballots and saying
that when those are thrown out, Trump gets the state's electoral votes."
That, in turn, would allow him to remain president.]{.underline} This
argument, and the many others that the Trump campaign could employ,
would almost certainly be specious. [But Tushnet cautioned against
underestimating the power of creative attorneys and motivated
reasoning.]{.underline} The legal justification for challenging the
returns would develop, he said, "in some ways that we can't really
anticipate now but that lawyers will come up with when it matters." [The
Republican Party has proven more than willing to violate democratic
norms. There is a sequence of events, each individually plausible, that
would allow Trump to remain president even after a clear
defeat.]{.underline} The academics I spoke with cited Bush v. Gore as
evidence. When the U.S. Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority
shut down the Florida recount, giving the 2000 election to George W.
Bush, it did so by reading the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
clause in an expansive manner totally at odds with typical conservative
jurisprudence. The Court even told other judges that their decision
could not be used as precedent. "The justices, along with everybody
else, seemed to view disputed facts through the lens of the place where
they have been ideologically," said Rick Hasen, an election law expert
at the University of California Irvine School of Law. Still, it's one
thing for the courts to interfere in an election with a three-digit
margin. It's something else to invalidate a five-digit win. That would
be truly extraordinary. But [it is not unthinkable. Autocrats abroad
often rely on packed courts to cling to power,]{.underline} and while
the U.S. judiciary is far more independent than that of Honduras or
Venezuela[, there's no doubt that Trump has made a substantial
imprint.]{.underline} He has appointed a historically high number of
federal appeals court judges. He has added two justices to the Supreme
Court. [One of them, Brett Kavanaugh, has been outwardly partisan,
raving during his confirmation hearings that he was the victim of an
"orchestrated political hit"]{.underline} designed to function as
"revenge on behalf of the Clintons," fueled by "millions of dollars in
money from outside left-wing opposition groups." [He obliquely warned,
"What goes around comes around." 4. Alternatively, Republicans play
extreme constitutional hardball.]{.underline} The courts aren't the only
mechanism Republicans might use to keep Trump in power. The Constitution
gives state legislators free rein to decide how to select electors.
Currently, most states legally require electors to vote the same way as
the people. But [in a state with complete Republican control over the
government, the legislature and governor could, in theory, pass a bill
that strips this power away from citizens between the election and the
actual casting of electoral votes]{.underline}. (Indeed, in some
instances, the state legislature alone might be able to usurp its
constituents.) [If this sounds far-fetched, recall that GOP governments
in North Carolina, Michigan, and Wisconsin have all recently pulled
lame-duck attempts to limit the power of incoming Democratic
governors,]{.underline} with varying degrees of success. To imagine how
this would play out, consider Florida, where the GOP controls the
governorship and both houses of the state legislature. If the Democratic
presidential nominee narrowly won the state in 2020, Trump might cry
fraud and demand an investigation---as he did in the aftermath of the
state's 2018 Senate race, when it wasn't yet clear that Republican Rick
Scott had won. The legislature could establish an investigatory
commission stacked with partisans and designed to sow doubt about the
outcome. Perhaps Kris Kobach, vice chair of Trump's erstwhile Commission
on Election Integrity (and the patron saint of franchise restrictions),
would lead it. The courts might still refuse to intervene. But [Trump
allies in the Florida legislature could pass a bill giving themselves
direct power to appoint the state's electors. Governor Ron DeSantis, an
outspoken Trump ally, could sign it, claiming that the fraud allegations
and "controversy" over the tallies make the popular vote untrustworthy,
and that he's merely implementing the voters' "real" will.]{.underline}
This might sound too cynical, but in 2000, the GOP-controlled Florida
legislature considered something similar. "They were effectively saying,
'Hey, if it turns out Gore wins in court, we're not going to accept
that, and we're going to assert an authority to appoint the electors
directly,' " said Edward Foley, at Ohio State. Such a move would also
invite a Fourteenth Amendment challenge, this time on behalf of
Democrats. But it's unclear if the conservative Supreme Court would
intervene. Foley, for his part, is more concerned about this kind of
scenario than he is about judicial manipulation. "Judges are fact based
and evidence based," he said. "We know that Justice Clarence Thomas is a
very different person than Justice Sonia Sotomayor, but I do think that
with most election results they would agree as to what the answer was."
But he worries that politicians might refuse to accept the Court's
decision. "The judicial process is going to be slower than the Twitter
process," Foley told me. "If the Twitter process forces or causes
politicians to dig in, then can a unanimous judiciary unstick the
politicians?" The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution gives Congress
final say over who becomes president. In some instances, the procedures
for how Congress handles election disputes are clear. If there are three
or more candidates and nobody wins a majority of electors, for example,
the House decides who wins. But if it's a two-way race where both
candidates claim an Electoral College majority, Foley said, it's unclear
which chamber has the last word. [What would happen next is anyone's
guess. But it wouldn't be pretty. "I think you could have a long,
drawn-out crisis in which our institutions lose
credibility]{.underline}," Levitsky said. [Even if Trump were eventually
forced out, "we'll be left with a situation where maybe 30, 35 percent
of our population believes the election was rigged."]{.underline} It's
in this kind of crisis that Michael Cohen's fears are most likely to be
realized. "[I could imagine some rioting, some civil
violence,"]{.underline} said John Carey, a political scientist at
Dartmouth who studies comparative democracy and who cofounded Bright
Line Watch, which monitors the health of American democracy. "We just
can't imagine all the possibilities." [Hopefully, we won't have
to.]{.underline} Trump may lose decisively, rendering his claims of foul
play empty. [He may win]{.underline}. Or he may lose a tight race and
cry foul, but still ultimately accept defeat. In the aftermath of the
midterms, for example, Trump groused about fraud without seriously
contesting the outcome.

### AT: Trump bad for NATO

#### Trump [strengthens]{.underline} NATO- allied defense spending and Congressional commitments.

**Kupchan, DPhil, '19**

(George, Politics@Oxford, ProfInternationalAffairs@Georgetown,

March 20) BW

But [even if Trump has the authority to scuttle the alliance, he is
**very unlikely** to do so. There is virtually **no
support**]{.underline}---[in his]{.underline} own
[administration,]{.underline} among [the]{.underline} American [public,
or]{.underline} in [Congress]{.underline}--- [for taking a wrecking ball
to NATO. Even as Trump cycles through foreign policy
advisers]{.underline} of various ideological persuasions, [they are all
competent enough to understand the abiding strategic value of
NATO.]{.underline} The electorate similarly knows better than Trump. A
2018 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey indicates that [75 percent
of Americans believe the United States should]{.underline} either
[maintain]{.underline} or increase the nation's [commitment]{.underline}
to NATO---exactly the same as in 2016, before Trump took office.
[Congress]{.underline}, though currently a wasteland when it comes to
cooperation across the aisle, [has responded]{.underline} to Trump's
NATO-phobia [by becoming a **bipartisan cheerleading squad** for the
alliance.]{.underline} Even as Trump disrupted last summer's NATO summit
by insulting and threatening allies---his aides reportedly finalized the
summit declaration in advance to limit the damage he could do at the
meeting---[the Senate by a margin of 97 to 2 passed a resolution of
support for NATO. The House did the same by a unanimous voice
vote,]{.underline} with then Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) calling the
alliance "indispensable." This past January, following leaks that Trump
was considering pulling out of NATO, [the House]{.underline} reaffirmed
support for the U.S. commitment to collective defense and [voted 357 to
22 to bar the use of federal funds to withdraw]{.underline} the United
States [from the alliance.]{.underline} A bill aimed at impeding a U.S.
withdrawal from NATO has also been introduced in the Senate. [According
to Senator]{.underline} Jim [Risch]{.underline} ([R-Idaho]{.underline}),
chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, **["there is zero
appetite in the United States Congress to leave NATO."]{.underline}** As
another shot across Trump's bow, House Speaker Nancy [Pelosi
and]{.underline} Senate Majority Leader Mitch [McConnell invited NATO
head]{.underline} Jens [Stoltenberg to address a joint session of
Congress]{.underline} when he comes to Washington next month for the
alliance's anniversary celebration. [Support on the other
side]{.underline} of the Atlantic [is **similarly strong.** Around
two-thirds of Europeans approve]{.underline} of the alliance. Most
[European democracies]{.underline} not yet members of NATO [are
clamoring to get in.]{.underline} Confidence in U.S. leadership may have
plummeted, but [Europeans]{.underline} still [want their security
guarantor]{.underline} to stay put. Furthermore, European [member states
are finally taking steps to **increase defense spending.**]{.underline}
Twenty-four of NATO's 29 members increased their defense budgets in
2018, and nine NATO members will this year reach the NATO benchmark of
spending two percent of GDP on defense---compared with just four members
in 2014. A majority of members are on track to meet this benchmark by
the target date of 2024 set at the 2014 summit. Even Trump is applauding
Europe for raising its military spending, noting in his February State
of the Union that "we have secured a \$100 billion dollar increase in
defense spending from NATO allies." [The uptick]{.underline} in spending
actually [began before Trump]{.underline} was elected---the product of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the 2014 summit at which the two
percent benchmark was formalized. Nonetheless, if letting Trump take
credit for convincing Europeans to invest more in defense improves his
view of the alliance, then let's by all means indulge him. To be sure,
Europe's leaders are hedging their bets. The European Union is
undertaking defense reforms to strengthen "strategic autonomy" just in
case Europeans do find themselves on their own. But that outcome is
hardly their preference. Especially as Brexit and populism challenge the
project of European integration, the last thing Europeans want is the
exit of their U.S. protector and pacifier. Moreover, [Europe's new
readiness to invest in defense will ultimately **strengthen NATO, not
lead to strategic decoupling**: the more capable Europeans are on
defense, the more the United States will value the Atlantic
link.]{.underline}

#### Trump [can't]{.underline} and [won't]{.underline} withdraw from NATO.

Since his inauguration, President Trump has indeed taken advantage of
opportunities to wield his executive powers on major foreign policy
decisions such as withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and
the Paris Agreement on climate change. But [an **attempt to withdraw**
from NATO, experts say, could bring an **extensive fight** not only with
**Congress** but with the **courts** as well.]{.underline} While
[Trump]{.underline} also [said he believed it]{.underline} would be
[**"unnecessary"** to withdraw due to what]{.underline} he said were
[new commitments]{.underline} from allies [to]{.underline} raise their
[defense spending]{.underline} levels, lawmakers on Thursday appeared
largely united in their belief that the president should not try to
unilaterally withdraw from NATO. ["No. He would need Congress with him,
certainly," Sen.]{.underline} Jeff [Flake]{.underline}, R-Ariz., [told
ABC.]{.underline} "I think it would be a mistake, so [I don\'t see that
as a realistic likelihood," Sen.]{.underline} John [Cornyn]{.underline},
R-Texas, [said.]{.underline} Even as most members of Congress would no
doubt be against him, whether Trump has the authority to do so is a
murkier question. Mary Ellen O\'Connell, a professor of Law and
International Dispute Resolution at the University of Notre Dame told
ABC News that the Constitution makes clear that the president needs
Congress to create a treaty, but it\'s less clear about whether a
president can dismantle one. \"The Constitution is silent respecting
withdrawal,\" O\'Connell said. \"Presidents have consistently
interpreted this silence to mean that he may withdraw under his foreign
affairs power without the need for Senate approval.\" Specifically,
previous examples of the U.S. abrogating treaties include former
President George W. Bush\'s decision during his administration to
withdraw the U.S. from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) and
former President Jimmy Carter\'s decision to withdraw from the Mutual
Defense Treaty with Taiwan. In the case of the ABM treaty, House
lawmakers in 2002 actually sought to sue the Bush administration over
the withdrawal but the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge who
said: \"issues concerning treaties are political questions best left to
the political branches of the government, not the courts.\" But former
Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, who at the time sought to involve himself
in the legal fight against the Bush administration, said that previous
court ruling might not hold up when it comes to NATO. \"Most legal
scholars think that the state of the law means that the president could
put out a tweet in the morning and pull us out in the afternoon,\"
Feingold said. \"I do think that\'s where it sits, but [if it
happened]{.underline} I think [there would]{.underline} finally [be a
**legal challenge**]{.underline} on the merits [that the Supreme Court
would have to consider.\"]{.underline} According to Damon Wilson, a
former official in the Bush administration who now serves as Executive
Vice President on the Atlantic Council, [an attempt]{.underline} to
withdraw from NATO [would pose]{.underline} a [wildly
different]{.underline} set of [issues than the Bush withdrawal from the
ABM.]{.underline} \"We went through a formal process of notification, of
announcement, of complying with the provision of the treaty that
provided for abrogation and that was built into it,\" Wilson said. \"The
NATO treaty isn\'t written that way, it\'s more simplistic, it\'s not an
arms control document with 62 provisions.\" [Wilson disputed that the
president would be able to simply proclaim that the U.S. is no longer a
member of NATO, pointing]{.underline} specifically [to **Article
13**]{.underline} in the treaty itself [that states any
government]{.underline} wishing to withdraw [must give one year\'s
notice to the United States.]{.underline} \"The United States would
essentially have to legally inform itself and give a one year notice
that it\'s going to withdraw,\" Damon said. [\"That\'s a **legal
provision.**]{.underline} The reality is President [Trump would have a
**revolt** on his hands]{.underline} -- you have [this]{.underline} U.S.
Senate [and]{.underline} even [the next US Senate]{.underline} that
[would not accept that.\"]{.underline} In a move that underscores the
extent of [Senate]{.underline} support for NATO, earlier this week the
body [passed, 97-2, a nonbinding measure that urged negotiators over the
annual defense policy bill to **reaffirm the United States' commitment**
to NATO and its obligations]{.underline} of mutual self-defense as
enumerated [in Article 5.]{.underline} [The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee also]{.underline} unilaterally [approved]{.underline} a
separate provision, also nonbinding, expressing [support
for]{.underline} the strategic importance of [NATO]{.underline} to the
United States.

### AT: Trump econ good

#### Trump's economy has hurt Americans- even if the numbers are good 

**Reich '19** (Robert, American economist, professor, author, and
political commentator, Chancellor\'s Professor of Public Policy at the
University of California at Berkeley and Senior Fellow at the Blum
Center for Developing Economies, The Trump economy is hurting most
Americans. Statistics won\'t fool voters, The Guardian, May 19 2019,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/19/trump-economy-americans-voters-unemployment)/ly

In a survey by the Washington Post and ABC News published on 7 May,
[more than 80% of Democrats]{.underline} and 66% of independents [said
"**the economic system**]{.underline} in this country" mainly **[works
"to benefit those in power]{.underline}**", rather than all Americans.
Nearly [a third of Republicans agreed]{.underline}. More Americans are
employed but most jobs still pay squat. Adjusted for inflation, recent
wage gains are smaller than the wage gains of 2015. Workers have lost so
much bargaining power that [not even the lowest unemployment
rate]{.underline} in half a century [is doing much to boost
pay]{.underline}. Employers continue to sack workers willy-nilly. One
example: AT&T executives promised that the corporate tax cut would allow
them to create more jobs. Instead, they've laid off 23,000. Add to this
that [almost 80% of American workers are living paycheck to
paycheck]{.underline}, and you get a feel for the havoc so many families
are living in. Meanwhile, the costs of education, childcare, housing,
and healthcare are soaring. **[Trump hasn't done a thing to
help]{.underline}**. If anything, [he's made everything
worse]{.underline}. Student loan debt is in the stratosphere. Remember
the old promise that if you took a public service job your student loan
would be forgiven? You can forget it. Betsy DeVos's education department
has rejected 98% of forgiveness applications. Housing is out of reach
for young workers, which is why so many are living with their parents
and postponing marriage. Yet [Trump keeps cutting affordable
housing]{.underline}. [Childcare is]{.underline} becoming
[impossible.]{.underline} The average cost of center-based care for an
infant is now \$1,230 a month; \$800 a month if you park the tot in a
family childcare home. [Health insurance is a nightmare]{.underline}.
Last year alone, [30.4 million Americans went without any
coverage]{.underline} -- about [1.1 million more than the year
before]{.underline}, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's National Health Interview Survey. That's the second year
the figure has risen after years of declines after the Affordable Care
Act. The reversal is largely because of Trump's efforts to kill the ACA.
His administration is now asking a court to throw it out entirely.
Co-payments and deductibles are out of control. According to a recent
Gallup survey, Americans borrowed \$88bn to pay for healthcare last
year, and one in four people decided not to see a doctor because of
cost. Trumpland has been especially hard hit. A quarter of working-age
adults in Texas lack health insurance, for example. (In Massachusetts,
it's 4.9%.) As if this weren't enough, [Trump's trade wars have hammered
rural America]{.underline}. [Farm incomes are down \$12bn]{.underline}
in the first quarter of this year, according to the Department of
Agriculture. Farm bankruptcies are at near record levels. Mulvaney may
be correct that people will vote for somebody they dislike if they think
it's good for them. But **[Trump's economy isn't good for most
people]{.underline}**. If Democrats speak to the practical economic
needs of Americans and offer realistic solutions, as they've started to
do, [Americans won't pay attention to overall economic statistics when
they vote in 2020]{.underline}. They'll heed what's in their kitchen,
and Trump will be toast.

demonstrated that his invocation of "America First" was not just
rhetoric. [However, regarding such matters]{.underline}, as well as the
trade disputes with China and North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement
partners, [the administration's emphasis is on securing a "better deal"

### AT: Trump Lashout/Violence Impact 

#### Their evidence takes Trump's rhetoric at face value- in reality no risk of violence 

**Robin, PhD, 18**

(Corey, PoliSci@Brooklyn, [The Reactionary Mind]{.underline} 2^nd^
edition) MP from file

[For all the apparent violence and statism of the rhetoric]{.underline},
[what's remarkable about Trump's political vision is how **economistic
it can be**]{.underline}, [especially at moments when he hews most
closely to a hard image of the state.]{.underline} [Where anti-market
conservatives historically flew into the arms]{.underline} (in both
senses) [of the state as an end run around the market, Trump often sees
in matters of state **nothing but the transactions of the
market**.]{.underline} [Money is the instrument of state
power]{.underline}. **[Money is the end of state power]{.underline}**.
Anyone aspiring to wield state power should be an adept of money:
success or failure in the business world is the best test of one's
political mettle. [Even when Trump **tries to talk the language** of
hard power]{.underline}---[violence, coercion, rule---he cannot avoid
**sliding back into the idioms of the market** he knows so
well]{.underline}. "China is our enemy," Trump says, and "the military
threat from China is gigantic." As a result, "[we've got to have a
president who knows how to get tough with China."59 Does that entail an
arms race, more aggressive deployments in East Asia, nuclear
brinksmanship? No, **just the opposite.**]{.underline} We need a
president who will sign the bipartisan legislation to force a proper
valuation of China's currency. We need a president who will slap the
Chinese with a 25 percent tax on all their products entering America if
they don't stop undervaluing the yuan. We need a president who will
crack down on China's massive and blatant intellectual property theft
that allows China to pirate our products (maybe if Obama didn't view
entrepreneurs and businesspeople as the enemy he'd be more aggressive
about this). Most of all, we need a president who is smart and tough
enough to recognize the national security threat China poses in the new
frontier of cyber warfare.60 [Having emphasized the military nature of
China's threat]{.underline} to the United States[, Trump makes no
mention of a military response,]{.underline} save for a glancing
reference to cyberwarfare. The antidote to the America fought [a
catastrophic war in Iraq]{.underline}. [The main
catastrophe]{.underline} of that war[, for Trump, is not the false
pretenses]{.underline} on which it was fought, not the failure to secure
basic war aims [or]{.underline} to [plan for
reconstruction]{.underline}, not the fact that it was a long-term
strategic disaster. [It's that "we should have hammered out the
repayment plan]{.underline} with the Iraqis. . . before we launched the
war." The Iraq War, in other words, was a bad deal. The Iraqis "should
pay us back." With oil. If they don't, the United States should
"implement a cost-sharing arrangement with Iraq." Trump has a lot of fun
with the threatening call "Take the oil." It was a frequent refrain on
the campaign trail, and it's the title of the second chapter of Time to
Get Tough. But notice how he proposes to take the oil. Why are we
footing the bill \[in Iraq\] and getting nothing in return? I'll give
you the answer. It's because our so-called "leaders" in Washington know
absolutely nothing about negotiation and dealmaking. Look, I do
deals---big deals---all the time. I know and work with all the toughest
operators in the world of high-stakes global finance. These are
hard-driving, vicious, cutthroat financial killers, the kind of people
who leave blood all over the boardroom table and fight to the bitter end
to gain maximum advantage. And guess what? Those are exactly the kind of
negotiators the United States needs. . . . [The closest Trump gets to
violence]{.underline} in this epic moment of confrontation between two
international powers [is a metaphor drawn from the trading floor of the
market]{.underline}.62 Trump has certainly surrounded himself and his
administration with generals and officers, though whether that tilts his
foreign policy in a more militaristic direction than has previous US
policy remains to be seen.63 It may simply be that Trump is as enamored
with the shiny medals of the top brass as he is with smooth peach
marble. Trump also will make the infrequent and passing nod to military
power, often sandwiched between an emphasis on other modes of power and
contest: "A smart negotiator would use the leverage of our dollars, our
laws, and our armed forces to get a better ter deal from OPEC." But [no
sooner does he mention hard power than he's **racing back** to the other
side of the table]{.underline}, [almost as if he's scared himself with
all the military talk and is more comfortable with the conversation
about economics that's going on over there]{.underline}: Operate from
strength. That means we have to maintain the strongest military in the
world, by far. We have to demonstrate a willingness to use our economic
strength to reward those countries that work with us and punish those
countries that don't. That means going after the banks and financial
institutions that launder money for our enemies. . . . [The most
coercive instrument he has in mind is]{.underline} that time-honored
method of **[the hard bargain: get up from the table]{.underline}**.
Rather than threatening his opponent with a rain of bombs or even
sanctions, Trump says the problem with American negotiators is that "we
don't threaten to walk away. And, more important, we don't walk away."64
[Trump's other favorite instrument of state power is]{.underline} the
tool of trade he perfected in real estate: **[the
lawsuit.]{.underline}** How should the United States "take on the oil
thugs?" he asks. "We can start by suing OPEC for violating antitrust
laws." Quoting a former White House adviser, Trump asks, "Isn't starting
a lawsuit better than starting a war?"65 In his business career, Trump
has been a plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 lawsuits. [He loves
to brag about his willingness to take his enemies to court]{.underline},
but the truth is that he often settles and is more skilled at
threatening litigation (and spinning his losses) than winning it. In one
of his most hard-fought and expensive lawsuits, a federal court awarded
him a mere \$1 in damages.66 His penchant for the tough talk of
litigation has followed Trump into the White House. When a federal judge
put a stay on his travel ban, the strongest response Trump could muster
was a plaintive tweet: "I'll see you in court." Indeed, for all the fear
that Trump poses a threat to the independence of the judiciary or the
rule of law, his primary mode of opposing court rulings has been, like
virtually every one of his predecessors in the Oval Office, to appeal
those rulings. And now, having lost so many of these appeals, he and his
advisers seem to have decided, at least on the question of the travel
ban, that rather than railing against the judiciary, the best course of
action is to quietly wait on the Supreme Court.67 Whether he wins or
loses, whether the sphere is domestic politics or international affairs,
Trump's primary conception of power remains the swagger of the lawsuit.

### AT: Trump Lashout/Violence Impact- Neolib 

#### Fixating on the possibility of trump violence sanitizes neoliberalism

[Part of the reason for this slippage from]{.underline} the [political
to the economic]{.underline}, [from the violent to the legal, is rooted
in history]{.underline}. As far back as the nineteenth century,
[capitalism assumed a militaristic guise, with references to captains of
industry]{.underline}, industrial titans, and the like. [The businessman
was often depicted as a general]{.underline}. [It seems
natural]{.underline}, then, that [given the chance to play an actual
commander]{.underline} in chief, [the businessman would continue to
speak the language of his original milieu]{.underline}. "[Dealmaker in
chief,"]{.underline} in fact, [is Trump's preferred term for the
president]{.underline}.68 [But there's another reason]{.underline}, of
more recent vintage, for Trump's slippage, and that is that **[politics
has increasingly assumed an economistic guise.]{.underline}**
[As]{.underline} Wendy [Brown has argued, neoliberalism is]{.underline},
among other things, [the conquest of political argument by economic
reason]{.underline}.69 **[The dominant rationale for public policy is
not drawn from the idiom of political philosophy but from the literature
on economics:]{.underline}** [choice, efficiency, competition,
exchange]{.underline}. (Among liberals, the most sought-after feature of
Obama's healthcare plan was the failed attempt to create a "public
option"---itself a confluence of political and economic metaphors---to
compete with private insurance markets.) In 1975, Jimmy Carter helped
launch the neoliberal turn in American politics by campaigning on the
claim "I ran the Georgia government as well as almost any corporate
structure in this country is run."70 Four decades later, managing a firm
no longer provides a standard of leadership. It is the substance of
leadership.

A point that you make frequently that I want to underline here is that
it's not only Trump not making sense or [Trump]{.underline} failing to
govern or Trump's incoherence, but you argue that he [is much more a
symptom, rather than a cause, of more profound contradictions in the
Republican Party]{.underline} and the conservative movement as a whole.
CR Exactly. The way I see this is that [Trump has been a total disaster,
but he was the best card the Republican Party could play]{.underline}.
[It was precisely the recklessness, the everyday contradictions, the
nudge and the wink]{.underline} --- all of the stuff that liberals and
the media see as such a scandal --- [that was the source of his power in
the base.]{.underline} Someone like Cruz would have gotten creamed,
likewise Rubio, and certainly Jeb Bush. [This is this guy who really
does express the best of what they had to offer. I don't think the Left
has really confronted, from a historical point of view just what a
disaster he is. I don't mean just mean he's a cruel person and he does
terrible things, which goes without saying. It really is unprecedented
in modern American history to have this kind of a presidency. **The
inability to move an agenda forward is stunning**]{.underline}. **[It is
a hollowed-out ideological shell]{.underline}**. [What's tricky for us
to analyze is that they still have a tremendous amount of institutional
power]{.underline}. [People on the Left look at that and say, "how you
can say that's weak?" People forget that what conservatism is and this
goes back to Burke at the beginning; it was supposed to be a process of
**the re-legitimization of hierarchy**]{.underline}. It was supposed to
be a moral argument for why the distribution of wealth and power was the
way it was. [The fact that conservatism today is so dependent not on the
re-legitimization of hierarchy]{.underline}, not on winning arguments in
the moral, cultural sphere but on things like gerrymandering and voter
suppression is not a sign of conservatism's strength; **[that is a sign
of conservatism's weakness]{.underline}**.

### AT: Trump = threat 

#### Trump is not a unique threat to norms/racism etc-their claim 

**Robin, PhD, 18**

(Corey, PoliSci@Brooklyn, [The Reactionary Mind]{.underline} 2^nd^
edition) MP from file

[In The Art of the Deal]{.underline}, Donald [Trump tells
us---twice]{.underline}---that [he doesn't do lunch. By the end of the
first 100 pages, he's gone out to lunch three times]{.underline}. Later
on, Trump claims that he doesn't take architecture critics seriously. On
the very next page, he admits, "I'm not going to kid you: it's also nice
to get good reviews." Warm encomiums---or detailed objections---to
various reviews follow. Elsewhere, [Trump says]{.underline} the
[Wharton]{.underline} School at the University of Pennsylvania [is "the
place to go]{.underline}" to become a great entrepreneur. [In the next
paragraph, he states that a Wharton degree "doesn't prove very much."1
Inconsistency has long been Trump's style]{.underline}.2 [But where
Trump's critics seize on that inconsistency as evidence of his **unique
liabilities**,]{.underline} yet [another instance of the difference
between him and his **respectable predecessors** on the
right,]{.underline} [a **happy avowal of contradiction** has been a
feature of the conservative tradition **since the
beginning**.]{.underline} Originally, that avowal assumed a tonier form:
as a counter to the simpleminded rationalism that was supposed to
animate the left.3 Against the belief that politics and society could be
reduced to and made consistent with the austere rules of logic and
reason, the conservative sought what Walter Bagehot called, in a
different vein, "truth as a succession of perpetual oscillations, like
the negative and positive signs of an alternate series, in which you
were constantly more or less denying or affirming the same
proposition."4 [The capacity to inhabit the twin poles of a proposition
and its negation, without attempting to reconcile or overcome them,
helped one appreciate and preserve the subtle textures of
society]{.underline}. [A complex social order]{.underline}, layered by
centuries of submission and rule, [would be ruined]{.underline}---made
smaller, more tractable, less grand---[by the leveling reason of the
left]{.underline}. "He claims that a constitution does not exist unless
he can put it in his pocket," sniffed Joseph de Maistre as he leafed
through Thomas Paine's various plans to remake the world. They were all
so legible and transparent, so slight. Burke had their measure, decades
before anyone had even heard of Paine: "A clear idea is therefore
another name for a little idea."5 [Trump neither knows nor nods to this
tradition. Yet as he ambles from one contradiction to the next, it's
hard to avoid the suspicion that his indifference to
consistency,]{.underline} his refusal to bow before the god of the
flip-flop, **[is part of his appeal on the right]{.underline}**. [It
advertises the image of the non-stuffed shirt that he]{.underline},
**[like so many conservatives before him]{.underline}**, [has long
cultivated]{.underline}.6 "Most people are surprised by the way I work,"
he says in The Art of the Deal. "I play it very loose. . . . You can't
be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you've got too much structure. I
prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops."7 [Trump
doesn't need to make things tidy and neat. He's not afraid of a little
chaos or disorder]{.underline}. He's also not afraid to give offense.
[He's as willing to defy]{.underline} the **[norms]{.underline}** of
political correctness as he is the rule of reason; [those norms are a
limitation on freedom]{.underline} as constraining as any socialist
design.8 Like George W. Bush, whose cowboy affect inspired the gushing
title "Rebel in Chief," [Trump plays the part of the happy
buccaneer]{.underline}, forever impolitic, [thumbing his nose at the
prissy professor of principle]{.underline}---[a part that invokes the
right's age-old hostility to political arithmetic and moral
geometry]{.underline}.9 "Sometimes," as Trump says, "it pays to be a
little wild."10 [While Trump's racism, irregularity, and
populism]{.underline}, and the ambient violence that trails him and his
entourage, [are often cited as the symptoms of a **novel disease on the
right**]{.underline}, [these are,]{.underline} as we have seen
throughout this book, **[the telltale signs of conservatism across the
ages]{.underline}**. [The racism of the Trumpist right is nastier than
its most recent predecessors---though certainly not nastier or more
violent than the movement's battle against civil rights in the 1960s and
1970s, in the courts, legislatures, and streets]{.underline}. It's also
more focused on Muslims and Mexicans than on African Americans. [But the
weaponization of racism and nativism under Trump is an **intensification
of a well-established tradition on the right**]{.underline}, [as studies
of American conservatism from the 1920s through the Tea Party have
shown]{.underline}, and as earlier chapters here have argued.11
Likewise, [the erratic nature of Trump's White House, the **freewheeling
disregard of norms and rules, reflect a longstanding conservative animus
to the customary and the
conventional**]{.underline}---[even,]{.underline} in the case of Antonin
Scalia[, the lawful and the constitutional---as do Trump's jabs against
the establishment]{.underline}. And [while there are important
innovations in Trump's populist appeals, populism has been a critical
element of the right from its inception.]{.underline}

Events **[There is no way of knowing what events will draw America's

reasons for concern]{.underline}. [Trump clearly likes to keep himself
in the middle of things, and that inevitably leads to disruption and

course, but it could make the Democratic nominee more appealing to some
voters who supported Trump in 2016 but have tired of the circus. [The

presidency, looks increasingly vulnerable to higher interest rates,
slower international growth and the normal ups and downs of the business
cycle.]{.underline} Most economists expect slowing growth in the U.S.

### Abortion

#### Abortion laws are key to the 2020 election -- pulls votes from previously uninvolved dems

**Arkin and Ollstein '19** (James- MA and BA from Medill School of
Journalism, Alice Miranda- health care reporter for POLITICO Pro,
covering the Capitol Hill beat, "New abortion laws set battle lines for
2020," Politico, May 18 2019,
https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/18/abortion-laws-2020-1455399)/ly

A slew of [new state laws]{.underline} effectively [outlawing abortion
has put the issue front and center in the 2020 elections]{.underline},
with abortion-rights groups [hoping the threat galvanizes complacent
liberal voters who weren't moved]{.underline} by the issue [in past
campaigns.]{.underline} An Alabama law signed last week that would ban
almost all abortions, with no exemptions for victims of rape or incest,
is already reverberating in the battle for control of Congress.
[Democratic]{.underline} lawmakers and abortion-rights [groups say
they're seeing a surge of energy in reaction to the news]{.underline},
and they're working to hammer the message that Republicans could do away
with a woman's right to end her pregnancy. While Democrats warned in
2016 that Donald Trump could remake the Supreme Court and jeopardize
abortion rights, the issue resonated more with conservative and
religious voters who wanted to see Roe v. Wade struck down. Now that two
conservative, Trump-nominated justices have been confirmed to the
Supreme Court and states are moving aggressively to pass near-total bans
on abortion in order to trigger a court review of Roe, Democrats are
hoping voters' past complacency on reproductive rights issues will be
replaced by fiery motivation. "The threat is real now," said Rep. Lucy
McBath (D-Ga.), who flipped a House seat in Georgia in 2018 as part of a
health care-fueled blue wave that gave Democrats control of the lower
chamber. "We know that they're pushing to take this to the Supreme Court
and undo everything that's been done for women's health care choices.
That's what at stake." [Democrats hope the issue will drive voters up
and down the ballot, starting with the presidential race]{.underline},
and that they can close the intensity gap among voters who cast their
ballots with an eye on the Supreme Court. But [abortion is likely to be
especially critical in Senate races given the chamber's role in shaping
the courts]{.underline}, which will decide the long-term impact of these
new laws.

#### Abortion is the main concern in key states- Iowa proves

**Scott '19** (Dylan, Policy Reporter, "2020 is quickly becoming the
abortion rights election. Here's proof." Vox, Jun 10 2019,
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/10/18659919/iowa-abortion-laws-2020-election-biden-hyde-amendment)/ly

[Iowa Democratic voters]{.underline}, [who will get the first say in
picking their party's presidential nominee]{.underline} next year,
[prioritize a women's right to abortion above any other major
issue]{.underline} heading into the meat [of the 2020
campaign]{.underline}, according to a new survey. CNN asked Iowa voters
about what positions are must-haves in selecting a presidential nominee.
[More Democrats selected supporting a woman's right to have an abortion
as a must-have]{.underline} --- 79 percent of in-person Iowa
caucus-goers and 80 percent of virtual caucus-goers --- [than any other
issue]{.underline}. (Iowa is letting people virtually participate in its
caucuses for the first time for 2020, but that is an explainer for
another day and another newsletter.) [Abortion ranked slightly ahead of
recognizing climate change as the greatest threat to
humanity]{.underline} (about 75 percent of all caucus-goers) and well
ahead of the other positions CNN asked about, like supporting the Green
New Deal, expanding student debt forgiveness and breaking up big tech
companies. Abortion rights also topped the other big health care issue
the pollsters asked about: Medicare-for-all. Nearly but not quite half
of Iowa caucus-goers said that supporting a shift to a completely
government-run health care system was a must-have for them. It looks
like [abortion rights will be one of the most animating issues of the
2020 campaign]{.underline}, especially as Republican-led states pass
aggressive abortion restrictions. It might not divide Democratic
candidates in the same way single-payer does, but, after Joe Biden's
tortured reversal on the Hyde Amendment last week, it has quickly become
a dominant issue in the 2020 debate.

### Healthcare

#### Trump has established healthcare as the center of the 2020 campaigns -- already tweeted his plans

**Walling '19** (Kevin, Senior Vice President of Corporate
Communications & Corporate Social Responsibility and Chief Human
Resources Officer, "Health-care debate front and center again for 2020,"

We are still months from the first votes being cast in Iowa, but [the
2020 campaign is]{.underline} already [well underway]{.underline}. The
Democratic field is nearly set and the uncertain specter of the Mueller
probe has mostly cleared the president and his team on the collusion
narrative. So [why would an administratio]{.underline}n --- hot off one
of the president's critical victory laps --- [announce in a legal
filing]{.underline} before the 5th circuit last week [that it was
backing a full invalidation of the Affordable Care Act]{.underline}?
President [Trump was hedging his bets]{.underline} late Monday evening
[tweeting, "The Republicans...are developing a really great HealthCare
Plan]{.underline} with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than
ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more
usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the election when
Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House." But the damage is
done. President [Trump has placed the health-care debate front and
center heading into the 2020 elections]{.underline}, and [there is a
very good change it will have implications beyond his own
reelection]{.underline} prospects. Many congressional Republicans are
rightly fearful of this new legal assault on the Affordable Care Act,
especially without a legislative response ready in the wings if the
lawsuit is successful.

#### The public prioritizes health care first- even Trump's base is concerned

American Bridge polled voters in small towns and rural areas, screening
out self-identified liberal Democrats, to find out what they thought of
the president. The group gave Trump a positive job approval rating
overall, and it backed a generic Republican for Congress by 29 points
over a generic Democrat. But the [Republican-leaning pool of voters also
gave Trump unfavorable ratings on several key issues]{.underline},
highlighting potential avenues of attack for American Bridge: 50 percent
rated Trump negatively on "cutting taxes for people like me." Several
health care questions were worse for the president. [Just 25 percent of
respondents gave Trump a positive rating for "reducing health care
costs]{.underline}," compared to [67 percent who rated him
negatively]{.underline}, while they split against Trump 39-51 [on
"taking on the drug and pharmaceutical companies]{.underline}." [The
polling is "trying to unpack where Trump's branding exists]{.underline}
[and where there might be openings]{.underline} to have a conversation
with these voters about Trump in a way [that makes them reconsider their
loyalty]{.underline} or attachment to him," said Molly Murphy, a
Democratic pollster with the firm Anzalone Liszt Grove Research who is
working on the project.

#### Lack of health care reform makes it a priority for 2020

**Rasmussen Reports '19** ("Health Care Promises To Be Sizable Voting
Issue in 2020," Rasmussen Reports, Jun 20 2019,
http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/health_care_law_jun20)/ly

[Voters continue to criticize the quality of health care in
America]{.underline} and rate cost reduction as a key reform. [Health
care is also shaping up as a critical voting issue]{.underline} again
next year. Eighty-five percent ([85%]{.underline}) of Likely U.S. Voters
[say health care is important to their vote in the 2020]{.underline}
presidential election, with [45% who say it's Very
Important]{.underline}, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national
telephone and online survey. This compares to 87% and 55% respectively
last October just before the midterm national elections. [Just 14% rate
health care as not very or Not At All Important]{.underline} to their
vote next year. (To see survey question wording, click here.) Consistent
with regular surveying since mid-2012, 33% of voters rate the U.S.
health care system as good or excellent. Just as many (32%) consider it
poor. In terms of reforming health care, 54% still say reducing the cost
of care is more important than making sure everyone has health
insurance. But that's down from a high of 62% in March 2017 shortly
after President Trump took office. Thirty-nine percent (39%) rate a
health insurance mandate as more important.

### Warming

#### Climate change and healthcare k2 2020 -- voters recognize it's Trump's weakness

**McKibben '19 (**Bill, American environmentalist, author, and
journalist, "Climate Change Suddenly Matters in the 2020 Race. Are the
Candidates Ready?" Politico, May 7 2019,
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/07/climate-change-election-2020-226797)/ly

For three decades in American politics, climate change has been the
issue that wasn't. Even as the temperature steadily rose, and evidence
mounted that it was human behavior---and human policies---that were
driving this change, candidates mostly deflected. And it wasn't hard:
During the 2016 general election, no journalist even asked the
presidential candidates a debate question on the topic. But that's not
the case this time. [Climate change matters for Democratic voters:
A]{.underline} Monmouth [University poll]{.underline} last month [showed
the issue as the second most important to]{.underline} Iowa caucus-goers
after [health care]{.underline}, and a CNN national poll found that [82
percent of Democratic respondents said it's "very
important]{.underline}" that their party's nominee [for]{.underline}
president [supports taking "aggressive action" to slow the effects of
climate change]{.underline}, the highest support among several items on
the progressive wish list. [Most]{.underline} of the candidates [seem
convinced it's a key weakness for Trump]{.underline}, and the
front-runners have all embraced the issue. (The latest to weigh in, Beto
O'Rourke, chose climate as the subject of his first comprehensive policy
plan: a \$5 trillion proposal for clean-energy infrastructure.) The
question is not whether the candidates are going to talk about global
warming, but how. As the race takes shape, two key questions are
materializing: What do climate-motivated voters really want? And how is
the issue likely to change the race? To review the sad history briefly:
The high point of presidential climate campaigning to date probably came
in 1988, when George H.W. Bush announced that he planned to "fight the
greenhouse effect with the White House effect." (He didn't.) In the
years that followed, candidates routinely avoided the issue. Al Gore
strategically avoided it in 2000, and then, even in the wake of Gore's
magnificent Oscar-winning 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth,
Barack Obama barely mentioned it in his 2008 run, aside from a throwaway
pledge that "the rise of the seas" would begin to slow in his
administration and unfulfilled plans made in a campaign speech on energy
independence to implement cap and trade and create 5 million "green
jobs." In 2012, it took Hurricane Sandy, in the final days of the
campaign, to shake a few pro forma words out of Obama and Romney. Donald
[Trump owned the issue in 2016]{.underline}: It was hard for anyone to
top his insistence [that the whole thing was a "hoax]{.underline}
manufactured by the Chinese." But if you look a little more closely,
[climate has been breaking through despite the candidates' attempts to
avoid it]{.underline}. Bernie [Sanders began making a big issue of
climate during his insurgent run]{.underline} for the Democratic
nomination [last time around]{.underline}. It was one of the most
reliable applause lines in his stump speech, and in one face-off with
