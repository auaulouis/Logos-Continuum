For **[[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark}** later writings to be
sustainable, two conditions have to be met. First, Baudrillard's
terrorism --- his attempt to communicate
**[[hyperreality]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the reader immediately,
allowing the crystal its revenge --- must be theoretically coherent and
possible. Second, his description of hyperreality as a unique
transformation of culture, in which an external social reality is
eclipsed in the vivid representations of the screen, must be an accurate
account of recent developments. The most sympathetic reading of
Baudrillard's later writings is to read them as literature, as Turner
and Mike Gane do.26 This is a legitimate strategy so long as what is
produced is literature. In other words, in demanding that he **[[is no
longer writing sociology]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Baudrillard is
committing himself to being judged by the equally rigorous, though
different standards, which are applied to creative prose. This is where
he falls into difficulties, for his later writing cannot really be said
to be creative prose. They retain their academic form and still seek to
provide a commentary on hyperreality. **[[They do not open up a
fragmented world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[but rather stand back from
that world, offering detached criticisms and generalizations about
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Baudrillard does not communicate the
vertiginous flicking from one television channel to the other, but
comments on the meaning of these changing images. Like the academic he
remains, Baudrillard makes claims about the general features of this
culture, rather than using narrative to communicate a message, as is
typical in literature. Moreover, there is no divide between Baudrillard
and the narrative itself; there is no ironic use of character or
detachment from the text. His writing is merely an earnest but stripped
form of academic writing, which moves from asserted claim to claim,
rather than from sustained claim to claim for the slow but rigorous
building of an argument.27 Once his obscure lexicon is deciphered, and
readers realize that by "code" and "matrix" [[Baudrillard refers
to]{.mark} the fact that [hyperreal culture]{.mark} simply lives off
itself]{.underline}, never coupling with a reality beyond itself, then
his sentences become assertive and static. [[The only point he makes is
that television culture is hyperreal]{.underline}]{.mark} --- signifiers
now float free --- and the only way in which this sentence communicates
that point is by positing these crude metaphors of "code" and "matrix."
Stylistically, [[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}'s terrorism [[baldly
states]{.mark} [that]{.mark} contemporary [culture is like]{.mark} a
hologram, a code, **[a matrix]{.mark}** or clone, because it is wholly
self-referential but it does not actually communicate what it is like to
experience this culture]{.underline}. Compare this style of writing with
J. G. Ballard's Crash --- a novel providing a very successful (and
deliberately obscene) description of postmodern culture. It recognizes
that culture's bodily indulgence, and knows that it does not liberate
the individual but reduces the body to a machine for pleasure, just as
the car is a machine for speech. The car-crash and the sexact are the
moments when the wholly technical machineries of the car and the bodies
are decomposed in an instant of pain that is transformed (for ironic
effect) into one of intense pleasure for the perverts who populate the
book. In communicating this new, debased ethic of bodily pleasure, where
the delight in bodily mutilation parallels a correlating spiritual
disfigurement, Ballard describes a questionnaire about car crashes which
Vaughan, the central figure in the book, has prepared and which lists
every conceivable injury: "Lastly came that group of injuries which had
clearly most preoccupied Vaughan --- genital wounds caused during
automobile accidents. . . . the breasts of teenage girls deformed by
instrument binnacles, the partial mammoplasties of elderly housewives
carried out by chromium louvres of windshield assemblies, nipples
sectioned by manufacturers' dashboard medallions; injuries to male and
female genitalia caused by steering wheel shrouds, windshields during
ejection, crushed door pillars, seat springs and handbrake units,
cassette player instrument toggles."28 The descriptions Ballard provides
of both cars and bodies are wholly technical and anatomical, emphasizing
that, in this culture, both "bodyworks" are (obscenely) reduced to the
same level. Against Ballard's rich, selfdeveloping text, Baudrillard's
writing is flat and strained. He simply breaks down his academic text
into aphoristic gobblets and draws on a lexicon of dead, static
metaphors. In the end, [Baudrillard falls between the two stools of
demanding that academic writing is inadequate to the analysis of
hyperreality, but still writing according to its conventions and thereby
vitiating]{.underline} either [the academic]{.underline} or the literary
[merit of]{.underline} his later [work]{.underline}. However, even if
Baudrillard wanted his later writing to be read as literature and even
if he had been successful in producing text which could be judged as
literature, the project of this later writing would still have been
irretrievably self-deluded. Even if his terrorism were a successful form
of literature, it could never (as he claims) communicate hyperreality to
the reader directly, for all writing is necessarily mediated; all
writing is an interpretation.29 [[Unavoidably, his]{.underline}]{.mark}
terroristic [[writing]{.underline}]{.mark} is an interpretation of
hyperreal culture, which **[[does not obviate the necessity of
interpretation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[however directly it tries to
communicate hyperreality.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### If they're right, then distortion is [so strong]{.underline} that it's immutable. Better to act within it.

[[Ironically, in trying to present hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}
immediately, [[Baudrillard falls into]{.mark} exactly [the same
error]{.mark}]{.underline} for which he so effectively criticized Marx.
Just as Marx failed to provide a truly radical alternative to capitalism
by employing the concepts of capitalist political economy,
[[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark} fragmented [aphorisms are [**unable
to provide a critical alternative** to hyperreality, because they are so
thoroughly embedded]{.mark}]{.underline} in and dependent on the very
cultural forms they are intended to oppose. The fragmentation of
[Baudrillard]{.underline}'s later writing [does not serve the critical
purpose]{.underline} for which [it]{.underline} was [intended, but
rather, **if [it has any effect]{.mark}**, [it sensitizes the reader to
the global media]{.mark} culture [Baudrillard wanted to
resist]{.mark}]{.underline}. [His attempt to portray]{.underline} a
[culture in which allegedly there is no]{.underline} longer any
[reality]{.underline} beyond its representations, **[is the academic
extension of that culture]{.underline}**. Contrary to his own
intentions, [[it]{.mark} is the very]{.underline} intellectual
[path]{.underline} he has insisted on taking, which turns its back on
careful research and close critical analysis, which
[[makes]{.underline}]{.mark} the desert of [[hyperreality grow]{.mark}.
It]{.underline} robs the reader of any critical understanding of
contemporary culture. Moreover, [it denies the import]{.underline}ance
[of developing alternative knowledge and understandings]{.underline},
[which would undermine media representations]{.underline} of the world
[because it asserts that these]{.underline} alternative visions [would
always already be incorporated into hyperreality.]{.underline} It is not
enough simply to say that television is a false reality; [one must try
and reconstruct a reality in which political freedom and critique are
possible]{.underline}, even though any constructed reality must itself
always be subjected to critique. Consequently, [against
Baudrillard[,]{.mark} [an appropriate]{.mark} form]{.underline} of
academic [[resistance]{.mark} [would be to insist
upon]{.mark}]{.underline} even [**[more rigorously researched]{.mark}**
and detailed [work]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 In particular, the
dialectical method [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} demands the constant
overhaul of concepts, whereby nothing is taken for granted,
[[would]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark}ed
[[Baudrillard from falling into]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[hyperbolic]{.mark}]{.underline} reification of mere
[[assertions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Alt Fails

#### They link to themselves. The alternative can only result the imposition of the neutral play their kritik criticizes

**Baudrillard 76** (Jean, "Symbolic Exchange and Death", p. 74)

[[The consummate enjoyment]{.underline}]{.mark} \[jouissance\] [[of
**the signs of** guilt, despair, violence and death are **replacing**
guilt, anxiety and even death in **the total euphoria of
simulation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This euphoria aims to abolish cause
and effect, origin and end, and replace them with reduplication. [[Every
closed system **protects itself**]{.mark} in this way [from]{.mark} the
referential and the [anxiety of the referentia]{.mark}l, as well as
[**from all metalanguage** that the system wards off by **operating its
own metalanguage**]{.mark}, that is, [by **duplicating itself as its own
critique**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In simulation, [[the]{.mark}
metalinguistic [illusion reduplicates and **com­pletes the referential
illusion**]{.mark} (the pathetic hallucination of the sign and the
pathetic hallucination of the real).]{.underline}

### Perm 

#### Bridging the gap between modernist and postmodernist critique via the perm is the best way to solve because it opens the space for productive dialogue---this is also key to preserving academic spaces as productive locations for social change

**Bloland 95** (Harland G. Bloland, Professor of Higher Education
Administration Emeritus at the University of Miami, "Postmodernism and
Higher Education"

The term postmodern is disappearing from the vocabularies of ex- cluded
groups, social scientists, humanist intellectuals, scholars of all
kinds. But postmodern terms and concepts remain very much alive and in
constant use. Postmodernism is disappearing because of its relativis-
tic connotations and because, by accepting the corpus of the postmod-
ern perspective, a group with a political agenda places its own position
in jeopardy. For those drawn to the postmodern critique, who have po-
litical, cultural, social, and/or economic agendas, including feminists
and ethnic and cultural groups, postmodern concepts are an extremely
effective weapon to discredit and delegitimate modernism, the status
quo, and colleges and universities as they are now constituted. How-
ever, [[if the metanarratives of modernism and higher education have no
philosophical foundation, the metanarratives of marginal and excluded
groups do not have essentialist foundations either]{.underline}.]{.mark}
This is what engen- ders the profound ambivalence toward postmodernism
of those who are most critical of the current modernist world. [By
avoiding the term \"postmodernism\" and by declining to identify oneself
as a postmodern- ist, critics may and do continue to use the terminology
of postmodern- ism, while retaining their own necessary metanarratives
to justify their political, cultural agendas]{.underline}. [If [we
accept the implications of postmodernism and see it as a cri- tique that
applies both to modernists and to those critical of modern- ism, we can
reach a point]{.mark} where the postmodern stricture [to listen]{.mark}
and listen very hard and long [to the \"other\"]{.mark} has strong
credibility. If neither side has any foundational credentials, **[there
is space for real and contin- uing dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
result of such listening and the pursuit of dialogue under such
conditions [could mean the retention in universities and col- leges of
the values of merit, community, and autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
their justification in Rorty\'s terms, on the basis of agreement that
these are, in some form, even as the particulars are contested, an
integral part of our higher education heritage. [For the excluded
\"others\" this kind of dia- logue could well provide the basis for
changing the meaning and terms of merit, community, and autonomy in ways
that are satisfactorily in- clusive and representative of the plurality
of \"others\"\' cultures and poli- tics]{.underline}. Currently, [we are
precariously poised between a modern/ postmod- ern incommensurable
hostility and the conditions for tough authentic dialogue.]{.underline}
In higher education our course is clear. **[[We need to increase and
sustain the dialogue, even as we acknowledge that the tension will not,
and perhaps should not, be resolved]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Impact 

#### The idea of hyperreality is a byproduct of postmodernism, not a description of it---their strategy can't escape the academy and their claims about the world require truth claims which is a double turn with Baudrillard's theory

**King 98** (Anthony King, Professor of Government, Political Science,
and Public and International Affairs, "A critique of Baudrillard's
hyperreality: towards a sociology of postmodernity"

As Jameson (1984) has argued, the emergence of multinational, consumer
(and, increasingly, post-Fordist) capitalism from the 1960s has
facilitated the development of postmodern culture which opposes the
restrictiveness of modern culture. In the light of the new demand for
consumption, a cultural superstructure has emerged which emphasizes the
indulgence of those very spheres - such as sexuality - which were deemed
dangerous under the productive Protestant ethic of modernity (Lash,
1991: 42). [[Postmodernity is]{.mark}, then, above all [a culture of
transgression which seeks to breach the cultural boundaries]{.mark} and
taboos [of modernity and to revel in]{.mark} the [ecstatic
liminality]{.mark} of the once restricted]{.underline}. Jameson
describes this postmodern transgression of the categories of modernity
(which is linked to a new consumerist ethic) in his celebrated
examination of the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. There Jameson
describes the vertiginous feelings which the individual experiences due
to the curious use of space in the foyer of that hotel. Postmodern
hyperspace has transcended the capacities of the individual human body
to locate itself, to organise surroundings, to map its position in the
mappable world. (Jameson, 1991: 44) The foyer of the Bonaventure Hotel
undermines the certainties and categories of modernist architecture. The
rationality of modern architecture which strictly and functionally
demarcated and divided space is replaced by buildings which deliberately
disorientate individuals and ask them to question their sense of space.
Postmodern architecture, then, subverts the ordered categories of modern
architecture and, in that way, Jameson's Bonaventure Hotel stands as a
shining example of postmodernism and its transgression of the
restrictive rational categories and boundaries of modernity[. This
notion of postmodernity as the transgression of the cultural categories
which were a central element of modernity and intrinsically connected to
the capitalist economy from the Industrial Revolution to the 1960s
facilitates a dialectical supersession of Baudrillard's concept of
hyperreality for [Baudrillard's hyperreality can]{.mark}, in this
context, begin to [be seen not as a critical insight into wider
postmodern processes but rather as the epistemological and intellectual
aspect of those very processes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Like the boundaries
which would subsequently be drawn up against sexuality, madness and the
Other, Cartesian rationalism analogously drew up a rigorous bulwark
against the epistemological liminality which threatened Descartes at the
start of his Meditations. As I have argued, [[hyperreality is the moment
when Descartes' extreme doubt has returned to the academy and we once
again find ourselves in the epistemological void of scepticism]{.mark}
where we can know nothing. [Baudrillard's descent into this]{.mark}
Cartesian [void epistemologically matches the transgression of modern
categories]{.mark} which can be witnessed in many cultural
spheres]{.underline} l Like consumer culture, which subverts the
repressive modern norms of sexuality in a demand for liberation,
[Baudrillard rejects the rational and certain boundaries]{.underline} of
Cartesian 'clear and distinct ideas' [[and resigns himself to the 'deep
whirlpool' of nothingness, although this transgression is for
Baudrillard a moment of profound disillusion rather than
liberation**.**]{.mark}]{.underline} It marks a moment of transgression
where the categories of Truth, certainty and objectivity are
transgressed in the pursuit of nihilism, which was from the outset
conceived as the dangerous and liminal Other for modern rationalism.
[**[This epistemological nihilism is an example of postmodernism, in
which there are no more rules and in which anything goes.]{.underline}**
**[Not only is this nihilism critically bankrupt, but it is possible
only if the pursuit of an objective Truth is regarded as possible and
desirable in the first place]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. A dialectical and
linguistic approach could never have posited the existence of a final
Truth in the first place and this approach has been similarly untroubled
by fears of an epistemological void.]{.underline} [For dialectical and
linguistic sociology which situates itself consciously in a Heideggerian
paradigm, [linguistic reality is enough in itself - it is not final but
neither is it in need of some metaphysical support]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The Heideggerian tradition allows us to situate Baudrillard's
hyperreality dialectically and to find it sociologically useful, even in
the light of the latter's abject theoretical poverty.

#### Debate is separate from the hyperreal and solves the aff. 

**Robinson 12 --** (Andrew, "An A to Z of Theory -- Jean Baudrillard and
Activism: A critique", 2012)

Baudrillard's theory of [deterrence needs to be
reconsidered]{.underline} in light of recent events. We have seen in
2011 that [[it is still possible to create events]{.underline}:]{.mark}
the London unrest, the student protests, Occupy, the Wikileaks saga...
[The system does not actually have the power on the ground to prevent
revolts, occupations, movements. Even the system's vice-like grip on
future significations is being partially broken through movements like
Occupy]{.underline}, which conveys different future images in its own
rhetoric[. [Anonymous turns the anonymity of statistical indifference
into a source of strength]{.mark}, using tactics based on the very
vulnerability to excess the system creates]{.underline} -- such as
distributed denial of service attacks (using an excess of web
connections) and leaking of documents (relying on the obscene
overexposure of information in the Internet). [[The
difficulty]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather, [[is in sustaining
events]{.underline}]{.mark} and expanding new frames of meaning. The
system monopolises and determines the [effects]{.underline} of events,
and kettles them in time and space. Firstly [the [system controls the
ways in which events are signified]{.mark}]{.underline} to
non-participants. Secondly [the system,]{.underline} having once faced
an event[, [will prepare in detail to prevent it "next
time]{.mark}"]{.underline} -- so it is hard for events to become waves.
And thirdly, [the system [unleashes a dreadful wave of repression
]{.mark}]{.underline}after each event, [attempting to foreclose its
irruptive force]{.underline} and restore the pervasiveness of terror.
Resultant [feelings of futility]{.underline}, anxiety and vulnerability
[are corrosive of movement-building]{.underline} and of repeated cycles
of similar events. The movement of revolt towards a terrain of refusal
of meaning is also partly an effect of the system's move towards coding.
[[The apparent lack of demands]{.mark} in recent waves of social
unrest]{.underline} (e.g. the Mark Duggan uprising, the banlieue revolt,
the Greek insurrection of 2008, the Occupy movement, summit protests),
and even many of today's "terrorists", [[is]{.mark} perhaps [a result of
the prevalence of the code]{.mark}. The presentation of demands risks
reinscription as simply a militant version of a position already
encoded]{.underline} within the system. People respond with actions
which counterpose their own expressiveness to the code. This is also
perhaps why [theorising the conditions of possibility for an Event has
become such a popular theme]{.underline} in contemporary radical theory.
Another possibility could here be added. [[It is
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}, in open-ended surveys, [[to give
responses deemed too complex to be codable]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
principle[, a more heterogeneous humanity would escape the code through
each individual's irreducibility to prior categories]{.underline}. There
are also certain texts, such as Cabal, Argot and Barbarians, which argue
for [incommunicability as a necessary part of radicalism. [The system
demands that everything communicate in its terms. Therefore, esoteric
language is an effective resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Keeping discussions of alterity forefronted in academic spaces is key to centering marginalized voices. (1ac card is more specific though -- ethic of incommens)

**Bloland 95** (Harland G. Bloland, Professor of Higher Education
Administration Emeritus at the University of Miami, "Postmodernism and
Higher Education"

[If there is a transformation in higher education, what should it
be?]{.underline} Is there a need for a set of values that transcend
group values, for a vocab- ulary that will speak to all groups within
the academy? Or should there be a wide open conglomeration of presumably
incommensurate values, ethics, standards? Some poststructuralist thought
seems to indicate that we already have this incommensurability among
discourses. [[The destruction of the belief in eternal
verities]{.mark}]{.underline} and the attenuation of the drive to search
for truth [[mean that higher education\'s task may be to pay much more
attention to values, what they mean, where they come from, what their
function is, and how to forge new values that fit the higher education
world and its mission.]{.mark} Because the borders of colleges and
universities are becoming more permeable in the postmodern
world]{.underline} and the great sustainers of the in- dependence of
higher education, the state and governments, are becom- ing weaker,
institutions need to find ways of maintaining autonomy in the face of
multinational corporate resources and power, the debilitat- ing effects
of the increased proliferation of active interest groups, and the
encroachment of extreme local power. In the world of simulacra and the
power that comes from creating images, [[the universities\' task may be
to seek and sustain a kind of au- thenticity of information and
knowledge.]{.underline}]{.mark} In this it needs to create a con-
sistent and useful concept of merit; it cannot rely as heavily upon the
strictures of science or the rules of a broken canon. [[But it needs to
sus- tain the value of merit and find with all the contradictions, the
plural voices]{.mark}, the lack of a sense of progress, and the
continual tension an in- terest [in]{.mark} and [pursuit of means for
measuring, judging, and rewarding merit]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
boundary between higher education and the market collapses, some means
for organizing and sustaining autonomous sanctu- aries, oases, or
enclaves in universities should be found that do not sim- ply respond to
the drive for performativity and the standards of the market.
[[Institutions of higher education need ways to construct and sus- tain
community, and community at several levels]{.mark}: community on the
campus and community in the larger society, a commitment to citizen-
ship. The emphasis upon the other, the marginal, the outsider, in
postmod- ern thought needs to be kept in the foreground in higher
education]{.underline}. **[[Colleges and universities need to find ways
of encompassing the other, of taking in marginal people and
ideas]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However, it should not be done in the
usual liberal strategy of simply adding courses on multinational- ism,
women\'s studies, and cultural studies. These need to be included in
academia more on the basis of their own standards. But the argument here
is that this inclusion does not mean that the search for and crea- tion
of standards of merit is compromised. An important means for en- suring
this is to follow the advice that a number of postmodern writers have
offered, namely, to listen very hard and openly. As Cornell West has
written, \"I hope that we can overcome the virtual de facto segrega-
tion in the life of the mind in this country, for we have yet actually
to create contexts in which black intellectuals, brown intellectuals,
red in- tellectuals, white intellectuals, feminist intellectuals,
genuinely struggle with each other\" \[98, p. 696\]
